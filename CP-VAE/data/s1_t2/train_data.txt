0	at five pm today , mr karamazov borrowed ten rubles from me , as a friend
0	the money you won the day before yesterday is still intact ; not one kopek of it is missing : it comes to exactly three thousand—that is , three rubles short of three thousand
0	alyosha suddenly turned beet-red
0	i hope he ’ s not jealous of maximushka , at least
0	i looked at her and saw that the voice in my ear wasn ’ t lying
0	in general , he avoided expressing value judgments , except on abstract matters , and that was particularly true when it came to sergei sokolsky
0	but , of course , i would not even think of revealing any of them here
0	then he suddenly realized that he was terribly hungry
0	but what if the beauty turns her attention to that insignificant and 'immature ' fellow standing in a corner and seething with rage , and what if she singles him out from the whole crowd of her admirers ?
0	and i do not care if it costs me my reputation or not , but i will save him !
0	would you tell us now why you urgently had to have precisely that sum : three thousand rubles , that is ?
0	talk of a nun !
0	she suddenly turned bright crimson , as if realizing she would done something foolhardy
0	so we have here a criminal who does not have enough sense to take the proper precautions and who runs away from the scene of the crime , leaving behind evidence that is bound to incriminate him , but two minutes later , after he has struck and felled another victim , he suddenly is supposed to have become the coolest , the most calculating criminal , just because it suits the argument
0	i stood there for a few moments , looking out into the darkness
0	when you were telling us earlier that you would rather be sent to siberia than reveal that mystery , we were quite puzzled
0	how can you remember that ?
0	no , no , it 's not at all official for the time being
0	for i ’ ve been anchored in this spot for five days now
0	all i know is that i was in a great hurry to see you
0	after living quite a long time abroad , far away from mother , his love for her suddenly came back , in absentia as it were , and he sent for her
0	he spoke to her like a gentle and affectionate little boy
0	and when i blurted out so casually about the document and saw his stupid , frightened look , i felt an irresistible urge to crush him under a wealth of detail
0	as i jumped into the bedroom and stumbled against the bed , i noticed to my relief that there was a door connecting that room with the kitchen , which meant that there was , after all , a possible escape for me
0	she stood in the doorway looking at perezvon
0	he 's very anxious to see you and so 's his wife
0	'what are you doing here , you with the beard ?
0	it would have been rather indecent , quite shocking , in fact
0	and i asked everyone questions about you
0	he explained that it was an official statement addressed to the highest local authorities and that , since those highest authorities were present there in his house , he would read the document aloud for everyone to hear
0	i never even had any such unconscious wish ( although i did keep the document sewn into the lining of my pocket and i sometimes touched that pocket with a peculiar little grin )
0	also , from time to time , the town ’ s high society would gather at mr makarov ’ s house for a dance , the mothers chaperoning their unmarried daughters
0	i was still very anxious to have an open and uninhibited talk with him
0	get out of here , you !
0	alyosha went down on his knees and bowed to the ground before the sleeping elder
0	as far as i ’ m concerned , they can keep my fifty rubles , kalganov said
0	never look into his eyes , you won ’ t learn anything from them—it ’ s like looking into a murky pond
0	why should it be incumbent upon me to save the honor of the family ?
0	indeed , i can even imagine a sign : prince so-and-so , bootmaker
0	but you told me the day and the time , remember ?
0	kalganov rolled about with laughter , that boyish laughter of his , so violently that he almost fell onto the sofa
0	he did not do so out of any deliberate malice or resentment toward the child ’ s mother , but simply because he forgot all about the little boy
0	i didn ’ t say i ’ d beat up chizhov , you spiteful woman
0	otherwise you would not be the vasin i know
0	when i was only eleven , mon cher , my tutor scolded me for staring too much at the statues in the summer gardens
0	she 's such a delightful creature !
0	but ilyusha did not like to see his father clowning and trying to make him laugh
0	i believe we shall achieve it with the help of christ
0	everyone has his own private idea , i said , my eyes fixed on the teacher , who looked at me in silence with a smile on his face
0	don ’ t worry , i ’ m not a madman
0	an hour later , he would answer the offender or speak to him himself , with a trustful , friendly look , as if nothing had happened
0	it is not that i am so fully convinced of the perfection of these family traditions but simply that at least they provide certain definite forms to serve as bases for concepts such as 'honor ' and woulduty
0	well , in fact
0	as to every man being answerable for everybody and everything , not just for his own sins , he went on , you are absolutely right about it , and the way you succeeded in grasping that idea so fully , all at once , is really remarkable
0	i ’ m sorry for him , and that doesn ’ t go well with love
0	in fact , we don ’ t need anything
0	i forbid you to , once and for all
0	mitya suddenly heard the voice of kalganov , who had appeared from nowhere
0	why did you tug at my sleeve ?
0	do not you see how hard you are making it for mother !
0	forgive me , pan wrublewski , it won ’ t happen again !
0	right , right , and , as i was saying , one head is good , but two is much , much better , dr herzenstube went on stubbornly
0	the table was laid as usual in the living room , although there was a proper dining room in the house
0	and then , you keep telling me i ’ m stupid
0	maxim drove off , but he did not give up
0	if you did , i ’ d be delighted in a way , because it would prove that you ’ d come to believe i really exist
0	these two often argued with each other about all sorts of problems of everyday life and nastya , the older of the two , always came up with the clinching argument
0	they seemed to be arguing about something , one trying to convince the other , begging perhaps , while the other disagreed and refused to comply
0	man is weak and despicable
0	and from then on , it was as if a shadow of doom had come over her
0	please do not glare at me as if you were about to tear me to pieces , mrs prutkov ; try to laugh it off instead—that would be much better
0	i want you to know
0	i tried to walk in but he barred the way with his body and wouldn ’ t let me pass
0	that ’ s what we ’ ve come to , is it ?
0	they leapt to their feet
0	do i know myself what i ’ m after ?
0	you didn ’ t stop me because you hate me
0	oh , tatyana , why do you say all that about him now
0	there were also flowerbeds all around the church and between the graves in the churchyard
0	the presiding judge was a squat , thick-set man of about fifty , with a hemorrhoidal complexion and dark , graying , close-cropped hair , and the red ribbon of some order , i no longer know which
0	neither his originality nor his fascinating character , neither his complicated scheming nor his strange adventures , not even the presence of my mother at his side could stop me any longer now
0	so only you , your late father , and smerdyakov knew the signals ?
0	so you ’ re pushing me out of the house yourself , to go to your damned chermashnya , right ?
0	i took advantage of the opportunity to make him talk , as i was quite intrigued
0	at the same time he ordered his servants not to admit grushenka to the house and , if she came , to tell her that he wished her a long and happy life and many good times , and that he wanted her to forget him
0	yes , he was certainly more practical than me but hardly more of a realist
0	i wanted to cry out : so you are afraid of my excessive ardor , you are not sure of what i might do ?
0	he slumped down to the floor and i whacked him again and then once more
0	perhaps in the inn , like the other day ?
0	i also felt that my dilemma of what to do about the letter concerning the lawsuit had become even more difficult to decide
0	no , i mean , will you forgive me for all the others ?
0	what need was there , i ask you , to represent my client as an insensitive monster ?
0	lambert , you are horrible and disgusting !
0	she was weeping too
0	but he had kept most of these secrets even from his family , confiding to his niece maria and to kraft only as much as he thought necessary
0	and karamazov now knew how to handle dmitry : the fellow could always be placated , at least temporarily , with small handouts
0	yet , despite all that , there was so much light in her face , so much faith in the future , that alyosha felt guilty before her ; he felt he had done her serious and deliberate harm
0	and you decided to take the short cut !
0	did you really believe it ?
0	what an awful night it must have been !
0	i remember that he was the most puzzled of all , once he had made the acquaintance of the young man , who interested him a great deal and with whom he used to exchange sophisticated barbs , although his feelings were often secretly hurt when he was bested in these confrontations
0	only smoldering corpses lay
0	altogether , i remained there for almost four hours
0	you know all those people , they all receive you
0	some of these times were of a rather morbid nature : debauched in his sensuality and often cruel , like some vicious insect , karamazov was occasionally , especially when drunk , subject to moments of mental anguish , of torment arising from a feeling of guilt that made him feel his soul was hurting him physically , so to speak
0	it all started from her sunken cheeks that i could not think of , or sometimes even look at , without pain , i mean a real physical pain located in my heart
0	one thing is certain , though—that is the mutual hatred that followed their early friendship
0	i do not know whether i loved him or hated him , but in my thoughts his shadow dominated my future life and all the plans i had for it
0	excuse me , prince , you made a mistake—my name is not arkady versilov , but arkady dolgoruky , i rasped unpleasantly , completely forgetting that it was my turn now to bow to the ladies
0	they had abandoned the card table and nelyudov , the young investigating magistrate , had come dashing in at a gallop from the other room , where he had been with the young ladies , and now wore a most determined and bellicose expression
0	you ’ re a dream and you don ’ t really exist !
0	for how could you live the rest of your life if you lack the courage to face him now ?
0	i got up from my bed and looked at her questioningly
0	tell me , kraft , i said suddenly , do you intend to see these people again ?
0	don ’ t you have a rag or something , so i could wipe it off a bit ?
0	so i had to drag along behind them for a couple of miles on a hot day , and we walked all the way to the institute , where they entered a one-story wooden house , a very respectable-looking one , i must say , as i could see through the window lots of flowers , two canaries , three lap dogs , and some framed engravings
0	the whole question , my thinker thought , was whether such a time would ever come
0	i clearly remember us grinning at each other
0	nevertheless , that 's just how it will be , anna , i wo not change my decision
0	in fact , he was absolutely unpresentable
0	she may very well feel like becoming a lady just like that , right away
0	this was , of course , most inconsiderate and rude and probably i ought to have protested
0	i ’ m locked in a cell , yes , but i am still alive
0	who ’ s going to marry ?
0	by the crown of the tsar ,
0	seeing mitya ’ s bloodstained face , perkhotin cried in surprise :
0	oh , she 's aware of the passion she inspires in him , she enjoys flirting with him , leading him on , but she wo not marry him !
0	stepanov just looked at me and shrugged in silence
0	he ’ ll accept it tomorrow anyhow
0	he seems to reject completely the separation of church and state when dealing with the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts
0	even at this moment , i feel the cold creeping over me as i think of it
0	of course , that was no way to speak to ladies , or rather to a lady like that because for me mrs prutkov did not count
0	there 's nobody we do not know—they are all friends
0	if i were poor , i ’ d kill someone
0	( i hope the reader wo not be so hypocritical as to pretend he ca not imagine what i mean by disgrace )
0	i am recording this fact here so that i may remember it as long as i live
0	perhaps that ’ s what makes it right now , but only for now
0	and there was nothing so stupid about it either
0	i heard everything and i could hardly control myself
0	my god , he ’ s dead drunk
0	so the three of us stood there and waited
0	he explained to me that this monastic practice is an effective method , evolved in the course of a thousand years of experience , and that it can now be considered a science
0	in a flash he tore the icon from mrs prutkov 's hands and , with a fierce backswing , hurled it against the corner of the tiled fireplace
0	yes , she suddenly decided to have a bit of fun at their expense—she had not thought of it before , but now she did—and soon she had both of them conquered and lying at her feet
0	he ca not still be there
0	the gentlemen burst into loud laughter at karamazov ’ s surprising statement and one of them even challenged him to back his words with deeds while the others went on elaborating on their horror and disgust , although with extraordinary exhilaration
0	these past few days he 's spoken of nobody but you
0	it makes me feel very depressed sometimes that , at moments when i feel the need for sincerity , i can never express fully what is on my mind , even to the people the closest to me ; there 's always something that holds me back , that makes me so mistrustful , uncommunicative , and unfriendly
0	madam , oh , dear , dear me , the messenger is here !
0	and if i just whistled , would not thousands of women come rushing to offer me their charms ?
0	as soon as alyosha walked in , the man literally leapt up from his chair and , hurriedly wiping his mouth with a tattered napkin , flew across the room up to alyosha
0	yes , yes , i remember now—i told her about it all right !
0	his heart was burning with love for the elder and he reproached himself bitterly for having forgotten about the old man , whom he venerated more than anyone in the world , dying in the monastery while he himself had spent the day in town
0	only i am not sure whether he 's in petersburg right now
0	i felt confused but not in the least surprised
0	but he had imagined that it was only a far-off , remote threat , and dmitry karamazov is , above all , a man who lives entirely in the present
0	is it because he ’ s stupider than i am and has managed to pour lots of money down the drain with nothing to show for it ?
0	alyosha had other more important things to worry about right then
0	ivan had not gone fifty yards when , hearing alyosha running after him , he turned back
0	i ’ ve learned a great lesson today
0	i do not understand how someone whose heart and head are completely committed to an idea can live by anything except that idea
0	i have been always on your side , andrei , and i have always concerned myself with the welfare of those close to you , but now , although the moscow sokolskys are practically strangers to me , i assure you , i feel terribly sorry for them , and i hope you forgive me for saying so
0	i am sure it would immediately split into two pieces—two , no more and no less
0	grushenka added in a voice filled with hatred
0	long ago , speaking of 'the traditions of the russian family , [ ] pushkin pointed out the legitimate themes for the russian novel , and , i assure you , these traditions are the only things of beauty we have had until now or , perhaps i should say , the only things that have taken on a definite form
0	i was not in the least sorry for a gentleman who had bought a nickel-plated milk jug thinking it was silver and who had paid five rubles for it instead of the original bid of three
0	the story is a good one because it reveals so much about a national mentality
0	so drink some more and that will cheer you up at least
0	please forgive my explosion , mother , i said with an affected laugh , trying to turn everything into a joke , i was so embarrassed when i realized that nothing could be concealed from mr versilov !
0	equality lies only in human moral dignity , and this will be understood only in our country
0	as might have been expected , no sooner had she spoken out than the pressure broke and she was crushed by shame
0	i am also absolutely convinced that there has never been any lack of such individuals among those who head their movement ; possibly even some of the popes themselves were such exceptional individuals
0	i think you have a wonderful nature , although it ’ s been corrupted a little
0	at present he is living in the provinces
0	but i want you to note this : frantic as he was at that moment , he still snatched up that brass pestle and took it along with him
0	but there is a bright , wide open road , a straight road , shining like crystal , leading to the sun
0	ah , i can hardly wait for that damned verdict !
0	he finally got hold of the bird , tied it to a branch with a piece of string , and , from an inch or so away , blasted at it out of both barrels
0	you heard him , you heard him , you monks !
0	and he walked off , this time for good
0	so i take it you ’ re coming , alyosha said firmly , seeing her tears
0	couldn ’ t dmitry have killed him , then , while you only took the money ?
0	i kept blabbering on like that until we reached the cottage
0	in general , all my life i have been very slow to take action
0	as i said before , he simply went around assuming that everyone else was guided by the same motives as he was
0	and you know what—you can bury me by our big stone , where we used to go for our walks
0	i hope no one heard me jump down
0	well , certainly , if one could help it
0	he managed to whisper quickly , his speech suddenly no longer faltering
0	and her guardian angel wept and walked away
0	but you , with all your learning , you ’ re no philosopher
0	relying on the janitor ’ s promise , fenya had not bothered to lock the cottage door
0	he shouted , in confusion
0	then i drew for him as complete a picture as i could of all the useful things a learned man , a doctor , or anyone devoting his life to the service of mankind could , accomplish
0	it seems i ’ m hurting you , alyosha , my boy
0	why , are you late ?
0	but , again , i did not believe he meant what he said , because why should he speak seriously about these things to someone like me ?
0	i ’ ll decide about it myself
0	i did not resist
0	whether it was or not , you would have been convicted anyway , alyosha said with a sigh
0	and then , suddenly , in the middle of it , he unexpectedly stopped and knitted his brows
0	if anybody must live , it is him more than us
0	the stone had been thrown hard and expertly by the boy beyond the canal
0	but i look at the people here , and no one except me seems to care about it at all !
0	but we are not equals—you are by very far my superior !
0	as a matter of fact , she may never understand it , despite the lecture i gave her today
0	at last the jurors rose , ready to retire
0	and that was when i started daydreaming about it
0	shut up , you fake
0	perhaps because they had got rid of me ?
0	oh , he isn ’ t the same
0	what comedy are you talking about ?
0	he would always come in the evening , sit in my room , and chat with me ; he also liked to chat with my landlord , which enraged me no end
0	that was great , great !
0	god knows why i became excited
0	i answered her immediately ( i couldn ’ t possibly go to moscow right away )
0	ah , and what difference could it make now ?
0	my coat is completely unbuttoned , but no one is trying to snatch it off me although there are supposed to be muggers all around haymarket
0	gregory followed the intruder without ever losing sight of him and , just as the man was pulling himself up onto the fence , gregory reached him , succeeded in catching one of his feet and clutching it with both hands
0	and so , sofia , do not worry your soul too much because your sin is my sin
0	fetyukovich did not bother to answer the objections
0	lately i would started going to zershikov 's gambling saloon
0	dmitry jumped over the prostrate body and pushed the doors open
0	i would like so much to help him
0	at last it was time for the defense counsel to cross-examine him , and the first thing fetyukovich wanted to know was about the envelope that allegedly contained three thousand rubles intended for a certain person
0	i see , however , that it ’ s not fitting for me to joke with you , gentlemen ; that is , not until things are cleared up
0	they had given him a real shock by suddenly revealing to him his daughter 's betrayal and her intention of having him certified insane
0	she could enter strange houses and no one would chase her away
0	but i am through now and , as far as i am concerned , you can all drop dead !
0	well , i had a good reason for that
0	i am not sure and i do not feel competent to judge whether those two lines are true or not
0	as to her second appearance on the stand , we all heard her voice shrill with resentment , spite , and hatred
0	i ’ ve been here before
0	they listened to him attentively and took special note of the fact that mitya had , quite some time before , established an observation post at the back of maria kondratiev ’ s garden , next to his father ’ s house , from which he reckoned to intercept grushenka
0	to make a long story short , he said , and it was probably the tenth time he would used that cliche , if i took the liberty of asking lisa to insist that you come here , and despite the fact that it is an emergency , for me the importance of the decision is so tremendous and final that we
0	he suddenly smiled broadly , although his eyes were still fixed on me
0	but why do evil ?
0	but have not you been to see him today ?
0	actually i should have known that rakitin would never forget to take good care of himself !
0	you knew it—i can see from your face that you understood everything right away
0	i swear to you , by everything i hold sacred , that i sincerely believe what i have just told you about the murder
0	she did that to distract me , although i always stubbornly pretended i was not in the least interested in the household news
0	he ’ s dying of impatience
0	look here , my good man !
0	you can not imagine how important your opinion is to me
0	shall i tell you what i think his idea is , tatyana ?
0	i didn ’ t even tell my mother until the wound was completely healed
0	in a corner by the icons , there was a lectern with a cross and a bible lying on it
0	i have come to you to ask what you think about all this
0	it is true that mitya had managed to offend some of these gentlemen since he had come to our town
0	it really seems very strange , my boy
0	let us drink new wine , the wine of great , new happiness
0	there was nobody waiting for you
0	karamazov protested , but ivan didn ’ t answer
0	it was open at the neck , leaving his chest bare
0	but now if i take this two hundred rubles , i can hire a servant , and you must understand , mr karamazov , that it would make medical treatment for my loved ones possible , that i ’ d be able to send my learned daughter back to petersburg , that i ’ d buy us some meat and we ’ d have a new diet
0	he cried out emotionally
0	i know i keep promising again and again to talk about something different only to wind up speaking about nothing but myself once more
0	i am not sure whether such an accusation is entirely fair
0	as a matter of fact , what puzzles me no end is how you , alyosha , have managed to remain virgin to this day—you , a karamazov !
0	i would never seen an expression of such painful shame on her face before
0	he was immaculately groomed and dressed , but his face made me , at least , think he looked sick ; it was grayish , rather like the face of a dying man
0	i pray god we lose the suit just to get it over with and then live just as we lived before
0	if i were still in love with him , i don ’ t suppose i ’ d be sorry for him
0	the bottles were brought in and mitya poured out the champagne
0	somehow—i do not really know why—i have been thinking of that doctor all day and ca not get him out of my mind
0	now you talk disapprovingly of my weakness for that woman , but it was you yourself who prompted her to lure me !
0	was it he or the lackey who killed your father ?
0	mrs prutkov , who would already opened the door to go back into the house , quickly turned around , closed the door , and faced me again
0	she could not refrain from abusing me whenever we met and by now it had become a sort of tradition between the two of us
0	alyosha quietly opened the door to the elder ’ s cell , where his coffin now was
0	tell me yourself , then , why we met here
0	say , how about a little glass of brandy ?
0	she had obviously put on whatever had happened to be within reach and came out wearing an open dressing gown
0	was that all he had to say to me ?
0	although alyosha did not answer , rakitin knew by a slight jerk of his body that he had heard him
0	wait , wait , my boy , just one more little glass
0	ivan was breathing noisily , glaring angrily at alyosha as if anticipating what he would say
0	you would better try to deal with lambert
0	she seemed to be in a paroxysm of sincere self-deprecation and , as she finished , there was a challenge to the elder in her eyes
0	lambert , however , soon recovered , realized that this was a lucky break for him , that finally he had me there , in his lair , at his mercy !
0	oh , don ’ t worry , gentlemen , i make no claim to be treated as an equal under these circumstances
0	she walked in with her gliding , noiseless step , swaying slightly , as statuesque women sometimes do
0	i understand he didn ’ t go in for refinement and that he even had a propensity for suddenly leaping up and using his stick on persons of the female sex
0	but then , in all fairness , it must be said , she was very , very beautiful and her beauty was that typical russian beauty that inspires passion in so many men
0	i thank you , i thank you , o god , for the great miracle you have wrought in answer to the prayers of a miserable sinner !
0	but he also told me much that was true
0	this had become a habit with him
0	he only riveted his eyes on ivan ’ s with infinite hatred
0	do you remember maria ?
0	there was a man in the land of uz , a righteous and pious man , and he had so much wealth , so many camels , so many sheep , and so many donkeys ; his children were happy and he cherished them and prayed for them , in case they sinned as they enjoyed themselves
0	we must be on our way , he said
0	mitya watched him from the side without stirring a muscle
0	i know you ’ ve done so
0	it was the woman in her that could not resist tossing these last words at him from the doorway as she was leaving
0	the russian aristocracy , however , has never resembled its european counterpart : even now after it has lost its special privileges , the russian aristocracy has been able to retain its superior status as the repository of honor , enlightenment , learning , and lofty ideals without becoming , as before , an inaccessible caste , which would have meant the end of the unifying principle
0	ah , dear god , if only i could collect a little debt that someone owes me as well , there would be enough money even for that too !
0	we entered noiselessly on the soft carpet and she made me stop by the doorway which separated the little room from the drawing room by a heavy curtain
0	after kissing her warmly several times on her laughing lips , katerina asked her to sit down in an armchair directly in front of alyosha
0	i ’ ll do my best and the reader will see for himself that that is all i can do
0	the truth is that , the way things stand now , i had to find out what had happened to that unfortunate letter
0	he imagines things , he 's a hypochondriac , tatyana , that 's what he is !
0	i chose the most despicable alternative
0	i understand you went to see her at her house yesterday
0	sit down , then , and read this one
0	just a minute , lambert , the pretty boy said , suddenly becoming so angry that his cheeks became pink , which made him even prettier
0	but while criminals often justify themselves in this way today , the moment the church superseded the state , they could no longer appease their consciences unless they said : everyone else is wrong ; they have all lost god , and their church is a false church
0	but we shall not repeat it here
0	nor will i ever forget how that evening ended
0	he seems sort of muddle-headed too
0	as a matter of fact i rather like you
0	i will never forget that heavy fixed stare and yet he was smiling
0	but blood was still gushing out and mitya ’ s trembling fingers were immediately splashed by the hot stream
0	among the simple people there were a few better-class people—two or three ladies and a very old general , all of whom were staying at the nearby inn
0	and , although he tried not to show his father how unpleasant it was for him , it made him painfully aware of snegirev ’ s humiliating position in town and always brought back to him that terrible day and then the shouts of back-scrubber
0	but that ’ s only a very small point and i don ’ t even know whether i could really be reproached for it
0	when she had to go to work as a nanny in the family of an official , she took her little boy to the manager of the mill , who happened to be his godfather
0	everything comes from god
0	learn how to know the right measure and recognize the right time
0	the corner where the bed was was screened off
0	no , it was i who caused it all while you were guilty only without guilt
0	and you know why i remained silent ?
0	let ’ s drink to it , mr pole
0	but i want you to rest assured , my dear boy , that i am terribly fond of you
0	remember , once in my house , you smashed the glass you were drinking out of ?
0	only the masses of simple , humble people and their growing spiritual power will be able to convert the atheists , who have been uprooted from our native soil
0	alyosha had never been able to walk past children indifferently , even back in moscow
0	oh , i ’ ll go tomorrow , face them , and spit in their eye !
0	his sympathy for that unhappy woman had turned into a sort of sacred cause for him so that , even twenty years after her death , he would not let a disparaging remark about her go unchallenged
0	besides , i may as well tell you that no one has ever really liked me , except perhaps for a certain ensign in my regiment by the name of stepanov , a featherbrained , dull , and altogether unremarkable fellow , whom nobody really respected
0	it was there then , but today it ’ s all gone
0	besides , he did not want to go himself
0	i despise your opinion and your horror
0	so what about her ?
0	that 's just a habit of mine
0	we ’ re making gunpowder ourselves now
0	alyosha , come over here—sit down , she said , beckoning him with a radiant smile
0	yes , sir , he ’ d marry her all right !
0	and to do it so that you come to love the hated one as well ?
0	and tomorrow i will face my ordeal , but i won ’ t hang myself
0	and i ’ m sure my nikita has taken to drink without me
0	he may , for instance , suddenly decide that a man must do whatever he is fit for and then repeat again and again a statement like ' i am a prince descended from rurik , but if i am not fit for anything else , there 's no reason why i should not become a bootmaker and earn my living that way
0	but how can he come home to you when you say that you hate your home now ?
0	it made me blush just to think how close i had come , on so many occasions , to blurting out a declaration of my love !
0	i suppose it would still be possible for some monk or a hermit to make a claim about his relics , but here was a man walking around in his town clothes—and there were all those other things we knew about him—and all of a sudden he starts talking about his relics and sets himself up as a saint !
0	since she was very attached to her servant , she immediately hired a carriage , drove the girl there , and , moreover , stayed with her to look after her
0	he was sitting on his bed in his dressing gown
0	then he will be saved
0	i ’ ll ask him , alyosha mumbled
0	he sounded businesslike again
0	he knit his brows and clenched his teeth , and his fixed glare became even more fixed and frightening
0	besides , even if we wanted to describe what was going on inside him , it would be very difficult , because it was not exactly thought but something hard to define , and something extremely troubled
0	four years ago there was a general in moscow
0	when asked about the insult he had suffered at mitya ’ s hands , he refused to answer
0	we still don ’ t know , though , who will be in charge of the escort , but , anyway , that ’ s quite impossible to find out in advance
0	mitya closed the door behind him
0	and what about the other one , alyosha ?
0	that day roast beef was served for dinner
0	i think you should take another sip of water , nelyudov said
0	your opinion is serious now
0	in general , he only answered when i asked him something , although he did so quite readily and pleasantly
0	what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	he ’ s just been ruined by his drinking and his disorderly life
0	i don ’ t understand really why fenya let you in
0	he kept intact the original thousand left to each boy by the general ’ s widow so that , when they came of age , each of them would receive two thousand rubles , thanks to the accumulated interest
0	you ’ re right there—the devil must be in on it too
0	it stretched across the whole wall , that painting , with plenty of blue in it and with that sweet little boy pressing his little fists to his chest , and the little girl , and the hedgehog—the teacher had managed to put everything in
0	and that german line he quoted—it was so much like you !
0	i am a high-school graduate and i am nineteen
0	but a non-russian criminal , i have been told , rarely repents , since many modern theories confirm him in his belief that a crime is not really a crime but only a gesture of protest against an unjust and oppressive force
0	what are you doing ?
0	or else take me to katerina !
0	you know , lambert , she has a tremendous admiration for versilov
0	so that there should be nothing left anywhere
0	the others , however , did not enter the cell
0	how could i ever have imagined such audacity on anna 's part ?
0	and he had turned so pale !
0	for two whole hours he felt almost happy and kept sipping his brandy
0	he was very proud , but in the end he became devoted to me , obeyed me blindly , listened to me as if i were god almighty himself , and even tried to imitate me
0	he was here but he ’ s left now ’ —that ’ s exactly what they told me
0	she heard him out with a sad and pained expression
0	and the most stupid thing was that he liked it so much precisely because there were princes of that name
0	it ’ s a nice slav name as i said , and i ’ ve brought him to meet you
0	not her either , because you ’ re not the only one who causes me to suffer , she does too
0	all i wanted was to utter the word and then judge from his eyes and his facial expression whether he would heard something about these shares
0	the little pole , beet red with fury but still maintaining his supercilious air , walked slowly toward the door
0	a merchant , looking somewhat tipsy himself , loudly praised the young man 's ability to hold his liquor without showing any signs of drunkenness
0	and the rest i kept for myself
0	i have meddled enough with other people 's consciences and wound up with nothing but taunts and rebuffs
0	—because he ’ s very much afraid to raise his voice
0	how can he be allowed to get away with it ?
0	i was about to leave dresden , but in my absentmindedness at the railroad station i took the wrong train
0	our eyes met and i believe i blushed slightly
0	and , come to think of it , you are her brother , almost her brother , are not you ?
0	and this is very true ; what they need is that unnatural combination , and they need it all the time , unceasingly
0	fearing that , i tried to put off that moment
0	i sat there and listened and felt as if the whole world were topsyturvy
0	but to my painful surprise , i found everyone rather tense and worried
0	and perhaps , remembering this day , you will also think of my words of guidance uttered from the bottom of my heart , because you are still young and the world is full of great temptations beyond your endurance
0	how could i not have heard ?
0	i remember only too clearly his frozen grin of amazement , verging on disbelief
0	and that handkerchief soaked in blood
0	so i ’ m sitting here and waiting for his messenger
0	and all the town pleaded with him for a whole month ; they be-seeched him and even thought to hold him back by force
0	so you are justifying that despicable princeling ?
0	she seemed afraid to touch the money
0	so what kind of monk would i make and how could i claim to have mastered my desires ?
0	and what do you think ?
0	but i wo not allow itl i muttered under my breath , gnashing my teeth
0	five years later in moscow , although no one told me you were my mother
0	our little boy must be with the lord now , singing with the angels
0	it had all been so unexpected that i stood there in complete bewilderment
0	i was trembling all over
0	what we like best of all , he told me , is to have girls sentenced to be flogged and then to flog them
0	it was a very large room , elegantly and lavishly furnished , not at all the sort of drawing room one would expect to find in a small provincial town
0	what do you mean by this , my polish friends ?
0	if anyone does not believe me , i can tell him that , when i accepted the money , i was firmly convinced that if i wanted to i could have raised that sum elsewhere
0	mitya sat down on the bed and started pulling off his socks
0	why do not you leave then ?
0	well , the end of that tail of his was in the crack of the door and , as i had a sharp eye open , i quickly slammed it shut and caught his tail in it
0	it ’ s for him , for my prince charming !
0	doesn ’ t that mean that you admit the truth of what i ’ ve said ?
0	enraged by rakitin ’ s tone when he spoke of grushenka , mitya suddenly cried out from his place : you bernard !
0	what makes you think so ?
0	anyway , what are you doing here ?
0	it ’ s not worth it , because that tear will have remained unatoned for
0	but i understood , of course , that it ’ s a philosophical novel and that voltaire wrote it to prove an idea and
0	here it is , see !
0	the water in his jug was changed every day
0	oh , dear , it ’ s all so wrong !
0	for now he sees clearly and says to himself : i now have the knowledge and i am yearning for love ; but now that my earthly life is over , there can be no self-abnegation , no sacrifice in love , and abraham will not come to me again and bring me even a tiny drop of living water ( that is , the gift of life on earth , the active life i possessed before ) ; since i will never again be given life and time , i will never be able to quench the fiery thirst for love that burns in me , because i scorned love while i was on earth
0	nelyudov prompted him curiously , but mitya did not hear him
0	he seized her by the shoulder , pointing the gun at her ( obviously just for the effect )
0	this time maxim was really puzzled : it 's no use , he 's no good
0	for , in fact , it is not we who are isolated , but they
0	the nag then makes a desperate effort , pulls the cart out of the mud , and moves forward , its whole body trembling , unable to breathe , walking somehow sideways , skipping in a strange , unnatural , horrible way
0	i ’ ve read it myself in the works of their theologians
0	why won ’ t he come over and talk to me ?
0	all this is just the opposite of what a citizen should be ; it is total isolation—i would even say a deliberately hostile isolation—from society , an attitude that may be summed up thus : let the rest of the world go up in flames as long as i am fine
0	no , it really had nothing to do with that
0	actually it took me only one minute to understand you completely
0	my dear boy , there was nothing i could do
0	however , i could no longer leave him , even if i would wanted to : i kept drinking and talking , feeling an irresistible need to pour out everything i had in my heart
0	i felt my blood seething with anger within me and i wanted to play a filthy , piggish trick on her , to treat her the way some vulgar shopkeeper would have under the circumstances
0	but if he was the murderer and not dmitry , then i am a murderer too
0	we shall tell them , though , that we are loyal to you and that we rule over them in your name
0	she , however , rejected that objection , assuring me that she would take care of that and that she had enough money to do so until i graduated
0	if i sent you to him , alexei , it was because i thought that your face , the face of his brother , could perhaps save him
0	what do you say ?
0	is , then , this breadth a trait peculiar to the russian that will take him far ?
0	you remember what i was telling you about soundness and unsoundness ?
0	and it doesn ’ t seem at all likely that katerina , as i know her , could be involved
0	it is only after a man has recognized his guilt as a son of christ ’ s society , that is , of the church , that he will become conscious of his guilt toward society , that is , toward the church
0	he cried worriedly , and then got to his feet and started running , toward the house now
0	lise cried out , at once becoming very animated
0	and he can write well , too
0	i ’ d say he threw out a good thousand on the gypsies alone
0	i ’ m quite afraid to visit respectable people with him
0	and now he stinks himself , and that is a great sign from god
0	somehow he got to like markel and received him in his house
0	and you , have mercy on me !
0	that 's out of the question
0	first , i want to demonstrate with mathematical certainty that my goal is attainable
0	of course i did not know then that he was going to shoot himself
0	kolya said , turning very red
0	for , as things are now , i don ’ t dare love my own children , let alone my fellow men
0	and so this package had been there behind those icons ever since
0	for the mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive , but in finding something to live for
0	and so good-by for now
0	the thought that i , who had been able to withstand hunger , could not remain master of myself during such an easy test of will depressed me no end
0	indeed , i am rather relieved now that it has come out into the open
0	who is this young gentleman we ’ re saddled with ?
0	that is , i see some other person and start following her and saying to myself 'it must be her , my olga !
0	i grabbed my coat and hat and told her to tell lambert that what i would said last night was all nonsense , that i was raving , that i would slandered an honest woman , that i was just joking , and that lambert , if he knew what was good for him , had better stay away from me
0	thank you very much , grushenka interrupted him with a bow
0	let me remind you of a brilliant thought expressed here earlier by mr rakitin , a young observer who had observed the karamazov family at very close quarters : the feeling of degradation is as indispensable to these unbridled and unrestrained natures as the sense of supreme nobility
0	but why , after all , why should not she have heard about it from some other source ?
0	he asked me to
0	mitya pulled the bundle of money out of his pocket
0	my suitcase was packed , and all i had to do was make a bundle of the few remaining things that did not fit in
0	and it was not , by any means , only the uneducated who believed it
0	he was a good and humane man , who gave his medical services free to the poor , visiting them in their huts and hovels , and even leaving them money to buy the medicines he prescribed
0	so here 's what he did , the landlord said so triumphantly that one would have thought he would done it himself
0	the doctor declared that ivan was suffering from an extremely critical attack of brain fever and that he ought to be taken home at once
0	let me tell you , and don ’ t interrupt me
0	oh , that is too kind , much too kind , but i am deeply moved and i accept your invitation !
0	that was the most important to me , and enthusiastically i told him so
0	well , i ’ m leaving tomorrow and i was just thinking that i ’ d like to see you before i went , to say good-by to you , when all of a sudden i saw you walking along
0	once on his knees , the elder bowed to the ground before dmitry—a deliberate , complete bow so that his forehead actually touched the ground
0	i had to load them in order to be ready to put a bullet through my brain at dawn
0	so if i can ’ t win either way , who can blame me too much for at least trying to keep my hide on my back ?
0	daria grew quite excited as she talked
0	please leave at once
0	but wait , did you tell the prosecutor about those signals , those knocks ?
0	he rarely appeared at mass
0	the food he served , although none too refined , was always plentiful ; his meat pies were excellent ; and his wine , which was not of a particularly good vintage , made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality
0	i was pretty sure , though , that you ’ d be hanging around here today
0	i want someone to marry me , tear me to pieces , betray me , and then desert me
0	mrs khokhlakov begged alyosha to report this miraculous prophecy to the father superior and to the monks—for everyone should know about it !
0	porfiry will take care of me , he said
0	actually he was a member of some political movement , did some writing , and was even published
0	and you , dmitry , you ’ re only too eager to exchange your fiancée for that creature ’ and so admit that your fiancée is not worth the creature ’ s ’ little toe even !
0	it isn ’ t that i reject god ; i am simply returning him most respectfully the ticket that would entitle me to a seat
0	ah , how stupid can you be !
0	i ’ d say he had two or even three thousand rubles
0	a bright red spot appeared on each of his cheeks
0	true , he did not actually come from the amasses , being fairly well educated and capable of some abstract thinking
0	believe me , whatever she may say or preach , the life of every woman is a perpetual search for someone to submit to
0	do not be angry and do not be so proud
0	and all this was done in great secrecy
0	why , no , how could he be dangerous ?
0	i have no idea what you ’ re about to ask me , alyosha said , his cheeks glowing
0	alyosha suddenly heard his own quivering voice as he raised his right hand as though calling on god as a witness
0	i have already mentioned that lambert 's position was quite shaky at the time
0	i was struck by the brightness and warmth in that boy ’ s eyes
0	watch now : here , perezvon !
0	that ’ s not the point now
0	he did not sit down again but remained standing , listening to her
0	here i will anticipate even further and say that she did not overestimate the effect produced by the letter ; indeed , if anything , it even surpassed her expectations
0	i rang the bell and the cook opened the door and let me in without saying a word
0	there 's no need for you to go on worrying like this—it 's not at all like you , you know
0	he contented himself with hints , but his hints were not understood
0	you will know great sorrow and in that sorrow you will find happiness
0	mother , my own dear blood—he sometimes used the most peculiar endearments—my own dear blood , my sweet joy , know that this is the truth and that every one of us is answerable for everyone else and for everything
0	once i suddenly became aware that she was doing a pirouette in the middle of the room , but she was not just dancing : her pirouette had a direct connection with her story and she was trying to use it to convey something she was telling me
0	but he reckoned that a loaded pistol would take care of everything for him
0	i have just left my wife , he went on
0	there ’ s nothing of the sort in the lives of the saints , said the father librarian
0	see you tomorrow then !
0	i can no longer remember what they said , but they did tell me something and i stood there listening to them without understanding a word
0	look , see , they are bringing new vessels in
0	he became very angry and said rude things about the church
0	it so happened that in paris i ran into stebelkov , whom i would met before
0	first , we must get the money and then we will see
0	but he could no longer make himself open his heart to these men , as he had done earlier , or try to explain to them how he felt about the queen of his heart
0	just wait a little and there are many things you will find out : you really have no idea of what 's going on
0	your mother tells me she did not know whether she should have accepted the money you offered to pay her for your monthly board
0	old karamazov shrieked suddenly in a voice that was not his own
0	i ’ ll tell you the story behind that money now , and i beg you , i beseech you , to hear me out to the end !
0	and at the same time my head buzzed with lots of very pleasant thoughts
0	it ’ s a lovely picture !
0	this most elegantly dressed young gentleman was hardly more than twenty , had an extremely pleasant face , a fine complexion , and thick , light-brown hair
0	don ’ t keep taunting me about being dressed up , rakitin
0	but tell me , my dear friend , tell me this : wouldn ’ t you despise me yourself , mr karamazov , if i accepted this money ?
0	lambert jumped up from the table
0	grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at alyosha tenderly
0	you had better be prepared for anything , the doctor said , pronouncing each syllable distinctly
0	the next day i bring her back the remaining half and say : here , katya , please accept from me , irresponsible scoundrel that i am , these fifteen hundred rubles , for i have spent the other fifteen hundred and i ’ m afraid i won ’ t be able to prevent myself from spending this as well
0	but he emphatically , indeed almost heatedly , attested to smerdyakov ’ s honesty , and told them about the time when smerdyakov had found some money his master had dropped and had returned it , and how fyodor karamazov had given him a ten-ruble gold piece as a reward and had trusted him completely ever after
0	what you need is a good beating , that ’ s what ; who do you think you are—going around insulting people , you impudent brat , you ?
0	but it did not arouse my indignation
0	she , too , came dressed all in black , with her magnificent shawl on her shoulders
0	why ca not you and why do not you want to ?
0	he ’ s just like that drunken pig , hollering at the top of his voice , vanya , vanya went to town
0	that way , boots last on the average one-third again as long
0	you could not have done that without versilov 's explicit permission and i would never have let you without his explicit orders
0	if anything protects society in our time , if anything can reform the criminal and make a new man out of him , it is only the law of christ , which manifests itself in the awareness of a man ’ s own conscience
0	as opposed to a polish woman or a frenchwoman ?
0	so why not , and may the name of our lord be blessed
0	so the whole point of my idea is that money is the only road that can take a man to the top spot , the only force that can propel him there , even if he 's a mediocrity
0	before her arrival at the courthouse , grushenka had somehow heard that rakitin ’ s testimony had been highly unfavorable to mitya and she had become furious
0	as the day was fading , the room was rather dark
0	but in prison he showed a strange love for children
0	he stopped her as one would stop a dog
0	i ’ ve just been indulging ’ a little , as that piggish friend of yours , rakitin , puts it , and will still put it even when he becomes a state councillor
0	makar 's stories also often attracted lukeria , who would emerge out of her kitchen and stand in the doorway listening to him
0	karamazov leapt up from his seat in a fright
0	katerina 's consumptive stepdaughter fell desperately in love with versilov ; perhaps something in him had impressed her violently or maybe his preaching had set her afire , but , whatever it was , at one time versilov spent whole days in the company of the girl
0	he was even less closely acquainted with the prosecutor , although he had occasionally called on his wife , a temperamental , moody lady with whom he had had very proper chats on those occasions
0	he made me sit down again
0	the impact was due mostly to the tone and to the unexpectedness of the conclusions
0	no one can try to turn me aside from my path without getting hurt
0	when i was already sitting in the cab , a new idea suddenly came to my mind
0	all of a sudden a new major arrived in town
0	smerdyakov never even hinted at the possibility of such complicity , despite the fact that the accused kept insisting that smerdyakov was the real and the sole murderer
0	and what difference does it make whether hell has a ceiling or not ?
0	i have come here to tell you something
0	ivan remained silent for a while
0	o lord , i so hope that my children will understand the price i have paid in suffering for what i have done , and will not condemn me
0	then , after rakitin had been excused , the presiding judge asked the accused whether he wished to comment on his testimony
0	take yourself , for instance : you could hardly be accused of a lack of literary culture , although you may still be considered young
0	and so they dragged in classical languages
0	what ’ s come over you !
0	he felt a violent impulse to hit the little peasant
0	you know , very fair , with a sharp little nose
0	although versilov was out , i did not find my mother and sister at home alone , as i had hoped
0	so you too must know that your child stands before the throne of the lord , rejoicing and happy , and prays to god for you
0	had you heard the things she was telling us now before ?
0	the first , an elegant barouche drawn by two fine horses , brought peter miusov and a distant relative , peter kalganov
0	i do not remember
0	boys , there ’ s something i ’ d like to tell you here , by this stone
0	now i want you to take that , plus another seven hundred rubles to make it one thousand , and i will keep the remaining two thousand
0	and now i ’ ll be left all by myself
0	the public was in great turmoil
0	does he owe you very much then ?
0	last week , for instance , i tried to ask prince ov what he thought of bismarck because i was very puzzled by bismarck 's moves and could not make out on my own what he was after
0	i ’ m not angry with my god—i just can not accept his world , alyosha said with a twisted grin
0	what stone is that in your ring ?
0	so he stands there while they all discuss what to do— montferrant , those englishmen , and that important dignitary in charge who , having just driven up in a carriage , is listening to them and is beginning to lose his temper because they seem unable to agree
0	what 's the matter , mrs prutkov ?
0	it was a clear , windless day and the temperature was only slightly below freezing
0	we never stopped talking about makar , and mrs prutkov told many things about him i would never heard before , much of which would be very interesting for its own sake if i retold it here
0	but there are no hooks there , alyosha said quietly and seriously , looking attentively at his father
0	i lied to lisa
0	perkhotin held the jug and kept pouring more water
0	i just couldn ’ t control myself
0	don ’ t you understand , alexei , this is her way of making you a declaration of love ?
0	no , alyosha , i ’ m about to tell you something much more interesting
0	he plans to go on drinking from it until he ’ s seventy or even eighty ; that ’ s what he says at least , and although he ’ s a buffoon otherwise , he sounds as if he meant it seriously
0	as i came in , you were standing in front of a mirror with some sheets of paper in your hand and were declaiming chatsky 's closing monologue from woe from wit , [ ] you know , 'send me my carriage , send it right away !
0	he kept hugging me with tears rolling down his cheeks
0	bismarck 's idea was at once acclaimed as a stroke of genius and bismarck was hailed as a genius himself , and it 's precisely that speed of recognition that makes me suspicious of the idea 's true value
0	i will just give now , without any further comment , the ensuing sequence of events that culminated in the horrible scene
0	why , when he saw me last i was just a thin , anemic , tearful seventeen-year-old
0	therefore , if i address myself to the reader now and again , it 's only a narrative device
0	well , after those three years , we ’ ll know english like genuine english people and , as soon as we do , that will be the end of america !
0	so now you know
0	but i realize that , aside from those rumors , you could not possibly have found out anything
0	let me make it clear that this old prince sokolsky , a very rich man and a privy councilor , was no close relative of the moscow princes sokolsky , members of a branch of the family that had been impoverished for several generations , who were engaged in the lawsuit against versilov
0	in the old days , serfs employed as house servants used to share many of the interests of their musters , intellectual as well as spiritual
0	we had four , nikita and i , but we can ’ t seem to keep them , our little ones , they just won ’ t stay , dear father , they just won ’ t
0	i am not trying to impress you , but i certainly have more character than you have
0	i was faced with the inescapable choice : to continue my education or to put my idea into practice instead of putting it off for another four years
0	it is both possible and necessary !
0	she suddenly frowned and turned again toward the doctor
0	judging by the vehemence with which you deny my existence , it would seem that , despite everything , you still believe in me , the gentleman said laughingly
0	i do not know why , but i need it
0	you ’ re a holy little fool !
0	yes , that is what everyone must feel deep down , instinctively as it were
0	actually i was surprised rather than offended , for i did not yet know what being offended was
0	but all of a sudden lise burst out laughing at my words , and she laughed so insultingly , it was quite terrible
0	i believe the presiding judge at once communicated this new piece of evidence to the associate judges , to the prosecutor and the defense counsel , and then to the jurors
0	you know , my boy , he said , as if pursuing a thought that had been interrupted , there 's a limit to how long a man is remembered on this earth
0	i have brought up this conversation about vasin 's neighbors here because of what was to follow and i must note that , while we were talking about them , we could not hear a sound coming from their room
0	as i would expected , lambert had been around and had recently returned twice
0	or shall we put him on the box with the coachman ?
0	he may be a chicken to you , rakitin , but that ’ s only because you ’ re a man without a conscience—that ’ s what
0	vasin then recited entire lines such as i have chills and i thought of drinking a glass of brandy to warm myself up but i would better not as it might intensify the bleeding
0	pan wrublewski walked with a rolling gait to the table and took the glass mitya was holding out to him
0	i remember many things
0	soyez tranquille , je feral voir raison a lambert !
0	russia is just a nasty mess
0	olga , but perhaps it is not even true , perhaps this is not his son
0	for even a priest who is short of time and overburdened with work and church services can still snatch at least an hour a week to remember god
0	i walked over to him and he put his hands on my shoulders
0	mr karamazov asked as he walked up the front steps
0	no , no , nothing of the sort
0	now i ’ ve noticed that you , mr ivan , have been going up to your room pretty early these days , and yesterday you never left your room at all
0	yet the more they respected him , the more painful it was for him
0	i suffer from my lack of faith
0	they searched all along the garden fence with lanterns and finally found the brass pestle lying quite conspicuously on the gravel path
0	he looked triumphant again , as though he had caught me most astutely and exposed me for something shameful
0	katerina 's face had turned very red
0	he almost whispered these last words and lowered his eyes
0	she said , turning quickly to perkhotin
0	i have it and i ’ ll read it to you
0	of course , i do not give a damn about taunts and rebuffs , but what 's important is that such interfering never gets you anywhere : no one will listen to you , however hard you try , and they will only end by disliking you
0	later that evening , my client pounded the upper part of his chest—where the bag with the bills was hanging—in the presence of his brother , swearing to him that he still had the means to save himself from being a despicable blackguard , but admitting that he would remain a blackguard , because he lacked the strength and determination to use that means
0	but from there you could have gone three different ways and i might have missed you
0	and although no one in the whole world knows it , every night i lie there in the dark and gnash my teeth and cry with rage , just as i did five years ago , when i was just a girl , and i still keep repeating : i ’ ll show him , i ’ ll show him , for what he did to me !
0	in one corner there were several icons , in front of which a lamp was lighted every night , not for religious reasons so much as to light the room
0	still , i hate darkness , i love sun
0	i assure you it was much better for you that way
0	why i needed it ?
0	a discordant note could be detected in the general mood now
0	as for the rest , it is still shrouded in darkness , although there are those who are only too anxious to tell all sorts of stories about me
0	kostya stared at his sister
0	so that ’ s the explanation : what happened to your brother dmitry was just this temporary insanity
0	and now , good-by , my dear , good-by , beloved people
0	but between one orgy and the next , he would drive all over the province complaining tearfully to all and sundry of adelaida ’ s desertion , and revealing on these occasions certain unsavory intimate details of their conjugal life that any other husband would have been ashamed to mention
0	it is extremely important for him
0	say , let me have a look at it
0	now , alyosha , tell me this : is it true that jews steal christian children and slaughter them on passover ?
0	in the meantime lent had begun , but markel refused to fast
0	it ’ s different with other people , but we callow youths , we have first of all to settle the eternal verities that worry us
0	he acted honorably , alyosha said quietly
0	but what a dirty blow that was !
0	the monks rose , greeted him with bows so deep that their fingers touched the floor , and went up to him , to kiss his hand and receive his blessing
0	he was walking slowly and it looked as if , early as it was , he already had a few drinks in him
0	you go ahead , rakitin—finish the whole bottle
0	what it was the reader will learn at great length in good time
0	and wearing that cassock , too !
0	makar , seeing that everybody around him was horrified by something , became frightened too
0	in short , there 's something
0	i admit now that i should have gone to see him when he first got sick and forgiven him
0	later , she heard the merchant was in money again
0	the two youngest daughters , who went to church in blue and green dresses fashionably tight-fitting with three-foot trains , got up at dawn on ordinary mornings and , arming themselves with twig brooms , swept out the rooms of the guest house and emptied the slops left by the travelers who had spent the night
0	but anna was in no way in the position of a young ward in the house of a rich and aristocratic lady , as often described in literature , like the young protegee of the old countess in pushkin 's queen of spades , for instance
0	but in the meantime we would like you to remove your socks too
0	i saw at once how much he had changed
0	the vulgar ones would be after money , while the more imaginative ones would be attracted to the strange , proud , and distant man , so inscrutable and detached
0	first learn to address me properly !
0	so we sat there , both of us , for perhaps two whole minutes , he looking at me fixedly all the time
0	but i wanted very much to cheer him up
0	roulette is prohibited by police regulation
0	i adore you , mitya muttered breathlessly
0	my dear friend , if you can manage it , get me out of here !
0	let us not presume to correct , from this platform of justice and sanity , the precepts given us in the gospels by our lord , to whom the counsel condescendingly refers as the crucified humanitarian , whereas to our russian orthodox church he is the lord , our god ’ !
0	i bet he lost his job and learned somehow that grushenka had money and that that ’ s behind this miraculous return
0	at that moment , you could not find a single european in the whole of europe !
0	miusov at first went about the matter with some zest , and was even appointed mitya ’ s guardian ( jointly with karamazov ) , since the boy had , after all , the small estate and the town house coming to him as his inheritance from his mother
0	the captain suddenly turned toward alyosha as though he were about to attack him
0	so what was the point of staying alive ?
0	i mumbled that i would been thrown out of the old prince 's house and that bjoring had shoved me in the street
0	besides , he did not have a tie and he needed one
0	what could i make out of that ?
0	it was you who murdered him
0	we have at least as many holy fathers as they do
0	the uncouth brutal german soldier was showing under the disguise of the society man
0	suddenly there 's not a single one left
0	he started , but she interrupted him
0	that evening had momentous consequences
0	besides , the three horses were steadily eradicating the distance that separated him from his immediate goal and , as he came closer to it , the thought of her , of her alone , gripped him more and more strongly , displacing the horrible ghosts that peopled his mind
0	there is hardly any need for me to say that i felt as though i were floating on a cloud
0	and just from all that worry , the spasm seized me by the throat and i went flying through the air
0	the three thousand
0	father paisii was , of course , quite right in anticipating that the sweet boy would come back , and he may even have guessed fairly accurately ( although not entirely ) the true nature of alyosha ’ s inner feelings
0	he said this with great sadness , but i was not sure whether he was being sincere or putting it on
0	mitya finally accepted their explanations , stopped protesting , and gloomily began to dress
0	but he studied me like that for only a few seconds and then a very slight mocking grin twisted his lips , whereupon he slowly turned away and walked back into the inner rooms just as lightly and smoothly as he would come
0	he was interested in it as a social manifestation and was anxious to classify the accused and his outlook as the product of his social background , as a typically russian phenomenon , etc , etc
0	she might , for instance , say to him without any preamble : take me , i ’ m yours forever
0	father joseph walked away from them filled with a sadness that was the greater because he felt he had not defended his views strongly enough , as if he himself had not been entirely convinced of what he had said
0	where was providence , then , and its guiding finger ?
0	i shall even be happy now , and i beg you to tell her that
0	tell me , alyosha , did he ?
0	when he entered , alyosha went to a corner , knelt down , and began to pray
0	i really don ’ t know why i felt like laughing
0	for at least half an hour , i kept droning on like that in a monotonous little voice with my eyes modestly cast down
0	once , quite long ago , on a warm september night , when there was a full moon and it was late by our provincial standards , half a dozen of our gentlemen , who had left the club in a rather inebriated state , were making their way home through the back gardens
0	it must be noted here that , although dr herzenstube spoke russian with zest and volubility , his sentences somehow made one think of german sentences
0	but that was only one episode among many
0	the peasant , for his part , kept throwing sly glances at mitya , appearing irritatingly unperturbed , even contemptuously insolent—or at least so it seemed to mitya
0	i am sure that if stebelkov and i had not been present , sergei would have been more dignified and resourceful
0	if you do not know how to act in this case yourself , how can i possibly advise you ?
0	tell me , you don ’ t think father zosima will last until tomorrow ?
0	no , there are too many of them , he said , putting the clipping back in his pocket
0	was it a fable or was it a passage from woe from wit ?
0	i checked by wiring to moscow to find out whether the money had been received
0	the other one laughed and sang to me
0	i really must go and report you
0	the train stopped at about three in the afternoon at a station
0	why did he have to prostrate himself like that ?
0	since the morning i saw you last , i have taken a step that not everybody would understand as well as you , with your uncontaminated mind and loving , uncorrupted heart
0	oh , we don ’ t mind at all
0	he shouted at the long-legged one
0	but the accused ’ s mania manifested itself most clearly , according to the doctor , in the fact that he was unable to speak about the three thousand rubles of which he considered he had been cheated without an anger and emotion that were out of all proportion , whereas he could dwell calmly on his other failures and frustrations
0	his heart must know why !
0	i ’ m a bit sad , though , that such a naturally charming boy as you , who hasn ’ t even begun to live , should already be corrupted by all this wicked nonsense
0	i will never come here again when you are around !
0	i know that , for two whole years now , they have been watching the maneuverings of his greedy and callous daughter
0	but ivan , who had silently taken his seat , suddenly swung around , put his hands on maximov ’ s chest , and shoved him so violently that he landed a good three yards away , only by miracle remaining on his feet
0	if i were a talented russian writer , i would pick my characters from the hereditary gentry because only among that species of educated russians can be found at least a semblance of harmonious order that could be used to produce an aesthetic effect of beauty so essential in a novel
0	good-by , mr karamazov , dear fellow , good-by !
0	as to sergei , it was as though he had not even seen me
0	and what about the vow i made to myself and to my forefathers to reform and to atone for my unspeakable past ?
0	he had the inn-keeper recalled to the stand and , despite the man ’ s obvious ill-will , made him testify to pan wrublewski ’ s substituting a deck of marked cards for the one trifon had given him and pan musijalowicz ’ s cheating when dealing
0	but once every three years or so he would turn up in town and come directly to my mother 's and spend some time with her , for it so happened that she always had a place of her own separate from versilov
0	i heard you were planning to go out tomorrow
0	i did mention his name several times while i was delirious , but once i would come out of my delirium , i became convinced that everything connected with lambert had remained a secret and that no one , not even versilov , knew anything about him
0	gregory was so overwhelmed that he did not speak one word until the christening , spending most of his time out of the house , away from everybody
0	obviously i could not guess myself what it was all about , so t decided to attend quickly to my business with stebelkov and then to go and see the old prince where i felt instinctively i would find the answer to the new riddle
0	however , katerina was quite intransigent on that point
0	as for me , i just got up and walked out on her once and for all
0	but instead , to his amazement , his lips started shaping completely different words
0	i immediately took out the money , paid for it , and retired to a corner of the room
0	a woman , who wore a cheap calico dress but who looked as if she might be a lady , sat on a chair by the bed on alyosha ’ s left
0	the thunderous shout of rapture of the seraphim
0	why should i always be expected to make the first move ?
0	often it is the one who gets the upper hand who feels embarrassed , precisely for getting the advantage
0	ten minutes went by and suddenly , in the very middle of one of stebelkov 's resounding broadsides of laughter , someone jumped up heavily from a chair , two female voices started shouting at the same time , and stebelkov obviously got up from his seat too and spoke in a completely different tone , pleading to be allowed to explain something
0	as to gorstkin , he looks like a peasant , goes around dressed in a peasant ’ s blue coat , but really he ’ s a downright fraud and that ’ s where we ’ re bound to have a lot of trouble , especially with his lies
0	it was obvious that his good reputation had preceded him
0	but i will get back to that later
0	i shall be calm
0	a lot of money , bills of high denomination—a wad of hundred-ruble bills
0	how would that be possible now ?
0	it was all confined to the document—i actually told versilov only about what concerned that document
0	but he answered his own question by entering the house
0	it ’ s not worth one single tear of the martyred little girl who beat her breast with her tiny fist , shedding her innocent tears and praying to sweet jesus ’ to rescue her in the stinking outhouse
0	but kolya was much too worried to stay and play with them
0	i had to find myself another place to five , move there , and also do a few other things i had decided must be done
0	i did that because i felt i was in a tight spot and needed time to grasp the situation
0	look at the way he ’ s walking up and down , grushenka said , looking at him scornfully
0	what revelations had i expected from him ?
0	i ’ m afraid you don ’ t know me very well , she said threateningly
0	all these details came out later and were thoroughly documented , but for now we shall confine ourselves to the essential events of these two nightmarish days that preceded the horrible catastrophe that was suddenly to engulf him
0	when he was at last excused , kalganov walked away in unconcealed indignation
0	i really don ’ t think so , madam
0	i hear that they have stopped flogging in europe altogether , whether because their habits have become milder or because they ’ ve passed new laws forbidding it , so that a man no longer dares to beat another , i don ’ t know
0	he feels sorry for me , ha !
0	so when you come in , you ’ d better not even look at me for a while—look at mother or out of the window instead
0	but that lasted only a few moments , and then there was a general commotion
0	you see , that is really not our line of business at all , the old man said very slowly
0	i would not even have to jump into the yard
0	but enough of that , because , as i suppose you imagine , i didn ’ t call you in here just to tell you all this nonsense
0	but i guess i ’ ve talked myself dry and my words have lost much of their meaning
0	but i must remind you that , here too , you are faced with a matter of life and death for a man !
0	he smiled as he said it , but his face was pale as chalk
0	very true , father paisii , a learned and taciturn monk , assented in a tense , decisive tone
0	oh , you knew very well at that moment that if you had made the slightest move to jump , you would have tempted god , proving you had lost your faith in him , and you would have been smashed against the earth that you had come to save , and would thus have gladdened the wise spirit who was tempting you
0	indeed , he was in no state to stand and observe
0	i have nothing but happy memories of my mother ’ s home
0	i decided to get straight to the point , feeling the pressure of her exaggerated warmth , although not altogether unpleasantly
0	but later i often remembered with tears in my eyes how he had asked me to live for him
0	what ’ s going on , gentlemen ?
0	i felt someone seize me by the elbow
0	but the hell with it
0	did you notice just now how kind grushenka was and what respect she showed for my loss ?
0	of those three minutes i only remember the presence of an absolutely beautiful woman , whom the old prince hugged and kissed while making the sign of the cross over her , and who , almost from the moment she entered , quickly looked around the room and then fixed her eyes on me
0	this will be the spirit of the new era and people will look back in amazement at the past , when they sat in darkness and refused to see the light
0	the voice was familiar
0	now , the monastic life is quite a different matter
0	they ’ ve finished their tea and the official has ordered some liqueurs
0	she covered her eyes with her other hand and it was obvious that she was very ashamed of making this confession
0	go and sit in the corner and wait there like the flunkey you are !
0	she had listened with still flickering hope to grushenka ’ s words about the possibility of doing everything to please her one day , like a slave ; she looked intently into grushenka ’ s eyes and saw in them still the same cheerful , innocent trustfulness as before
0	martha answered these bitter , albeit justified , reproaches by pointing out that the hen had been an old hen and that she herself was not a trained chef like smerdyakov
0	a few most inappropriate things , i dare say
0	but the examining magistrate politely suggested that mitya stick to the point
0	the other room across the passage was empty : the forester had left
0	and this time , i mean what i say seriously
0	i alleged family reasons
0	lise was tremendously moved by the story
0	well , in that case
0	what a funny brat , a woman said
0	juicy morsels do not tempt me
0	i want you to understand that i ’ m telling you something that i was told myself , just a legend
0	so she ’ s not angry with me for being jealous !
0	two minutes passed in that way
0	well , it 's not that bad really—they did not sentence her to hard labor in siberia , so do not take it so hard
0	they ’ re not yet guilty of anything
0	i wonder what our good peasants will say now ?
0	that rather annoyed me
0	dmitry interrupted her , somehow beginning to worry again , i may
0	this is something about which you were right
0	i gave her a look that i thought was close enough and saw nothing particularly interesting : she was not very tall , rather plump , and her cheeks were a very bright red
0	his hair was fair ; his light gray eyes were large ; his face seemed very open , although i felt that there was also something needlessly hard about it
0	i can do it from right here
0	it still would not necessarily follow that he had killed his father
0	you may be right
0	you ’ re still too young to know everything that grown-ups know , but i ’ ll be back and i ’ ll tell you as much of it as possible
0	listen , if there ’ s something you ’ d like to talk to me about , he said suddenly , please change the subject
0	that ’ s just it , my boy
0	if he hadn ’ t been so drunk , he wouldn ’ t have written it !
0	and even if every one of those fellows was the greatest of engineers or the greatest anything , i still say the hell with them , they aren ’ t my kind of people , and i don ’ t want to have anything to do with them
0	ah , if there was a way to relive that period , how differently i would behave !
0	at kraft's—you know , the man who shot himself
0	as to my present trouble with the police and the possible consequences when i would have to answer the charges , i simply forgot to think about that
0	i suffer , forgive me , i suffer
0	they had no proof whatever , the officer knew it , and they did not even insist they had
0	yes , that ’ s all , and i always suspected as much !
0	three or four years after his second wife ’ s death , he had gone to the south of russia , ending up in odessa where he stayed for several years
0	i simply wanted to crush the bouquet because it was beautiful
0	i see , so you were planning to blackmail me later , too , for the rest of my life , ivan growled through his teeth
0	for the great concern of these miserable creatures is not that every individual should find something to worship that he personally considers worthy of worship , but that they should find something in which they can all believe and which they can all worship in common ; it is essential that it should be in common
0	why , must you have that too ?
0	but didn ’ t he despise me and laugh at me ?
0	and there 's another reason that proves she loves you ; i will tell you all about it when you come home with me , and then you will know that it 's true
0	oh , i ’ d be happy to die if i could live for one single year without knowing about that blood
0	i can tell you this for certain , grushenka , alyosha said , getting up
0	we were not allowed long together anyway , for his wife kept looking in every minute
0	something happened within alyosha and , looking at all those bright young faces around him , he said :
0	if dogs could reason and criticize , i ’ m sure they ’ d find as much or even more to laugh at in the social relations of their human masters
0	a square wooden peasant table had been moved out of that corner and was now under the middle window
0	well , it is true , gentlemen , so let them get out of the way , either with or without awe , but in my humble opinion the great writer finished his novel in that way , either in a fit of childish sentimentality or simply to placate the censors of his time , for , if his own heroes sobakevich , nozdrev , and chichikov had been harnessed to his troika , such horses would not get anywhere , whoever held the reins !
0	i wish i had counted it
0	and what a beautiful race of men lived here !
0	i even wanted
0	later i heard about some of these
0	in the evening he felt ill and sent for a doctor
0	alyosha decided to wait as long as necessary
0	when suddenly i realized i was crying , i became frightfully embarrassed
0	would he be running after you too by any chance ?
0	doctors came and fussed about ,
0	the poor thing told me with a strange bewilderment , helplessly shaking her head , how she had spent six whole months there alone with her tiny daughter , without speaking the language , feeling like a babe in the woods , and how in the end she had even run out of money
0	they drive there together
0	that disproportionate amount of profit involved no risk since i could tell from the eyes of the customer that he would not back out
0	yes , stop at father ’ s before you go to see her and ask him for the three thousand
0	i ’ ll go , father , i ’ ll do as you say
0	let ’ s talk about important things : have you had anything to eat today ?
0	alyosha never felt the least surprise that all these people should love the elder , that they should prostrate themselves before him , weeping with emotion at the mere sight of his face
0	there 's a sacred truth in those two lines !
0	i walked quickly out of the yard
0	do you repent it now ?
0	but he won ’ t leave town
0	i quickly stepped back into the study , closing the door behind me , unnoticed by sergei , who came in through the other door
0	but now , enough talking , for it ’ s time to go to the funeral repast
0	forget all of them and let 's get out of here
0	those who had known him before found him terribly aged , although he was still by no means an old man
0	it was a beautiful night , brisk , just below freezing
0	after he woke up , it took him a long time to understand where he was and what was happening
0	i will not really attempt to explain
0	but , noticing the open doors of the other rooms , she quickly closed hers , leaving just a crack through which she listened until olga 's steps could no longer be heard
0	what are we going to do now ?
0	no , i do not find that acceptable , alyosha said and his eyes suddenly flared up
0	as is well known , there is tremendous diversity in tastes , and perkhotin thought pleasantly , she ’ s not at all middle-aged really !
0	the prosecutor , on the other hand , was exultant
0	as i was hurrying here
0	ah , ilyusha , my darling , you ’ re a nice , nice boy who really loves his mamma !
0	there are no moral ideas now , none at all
0	he even slept with it
0	no , thank god , you are not godless
0	and alyosha had been certain that she really was as he saw her and that he had not exaggerated these traits in her
0	both letters were sent off the next morning
0	yes , alyosha thought , his head already on the pillow , with smerdyakov dead , ivan ’ s testimony will not be believed ; nevertheless he ’ ll go and testify !
0	please try instead to understand us , in our position
0	how could she even imagine that you are in love with mrs akhmakov !
0	could not you manage somehow to hide his filthy shirt ?
0	i tell you once more that man has no more pressing , agonizing need than the need to find someone to whom he can hand over as quickly as possible the gift of freedom with which the poor wretch comes into the world
0	no , she won ’ t come today
0	she let me
0	but you do not have any at all !
0	well , that ’ s how it is , brother !
0	with the great concept of immortality gone , they have to replace it with something , and the immense reserves of love that before were lavished on him who was immortality are now directed toward nature , the world , fellow men , every blade of grass
0	no , wait , it wasn ’ t karl
0	mitya cried enthusiastically ( he was still in the same exhilarated state ) and ran back home
0	if i could have , i ’ d have left town just to get away from him
0	no , no , it ca not be
0	did something happen to you at anna 's ?
0	nonsense , utter nonsense
0	he looked calm , almost majestic
0	let me anticipate here and say that it was precisely this ambivalence about my plans and my goals , all of which took shape in moscow and remained with me in petersburg ( for i do not know whether a day passed without my setting a final limit when i would break off my relations with them and leave ) , this ambivalence , as i was saying , that was probably one of the main reasons for the indiscretions , villainies , nastiness , and , of course , blunders i have been guilty of during the past year
0	it was also a photograph , a much smaller one , in a narrow wooden oval frame
0	alyosha crossed the bridge and climbed uphill along the fence , straight toward the ostracized boy
0	because he was paid not in shares but in hard cash
0	but i will be satisfied because i will have broken her !
0	she had sold her house and now lived with her mother in an old , ramshackle cottage
0	ah , the hell with you !
0	it is possible , though , that lambert did not even bother to be that subtle
0	i was not drunk last night , it was not the wine
0	but now , fifteen centuries later , we can see that in those questions everything was perfectly foreseen and predicted and has proved so true that there is nothing we can add or subtract anymore
0	he also knows that his father has an envelope in the house with three thousand rubles in it , which he sealed with three seals , tied with a ribbon , and addressed in his own hand to my darling grushenka if she comes to me , to which , three days later , he added , to my little chick
0	that was all , however , and he never touched her again
0	the fact that i hated women helped too
0	i ’ ll pray for you today
0	so i ’ m off to the priest ’ s now !
0	after stebelkov had left , he was about to sit down , but he glanced at me and changed his mind
0	this was a crucial problem for our monastery because it had not previously been renowned for anything in particular : it had no saints ’ relics , no miracle-working icons , nor even any glorious traditions connected with the history of russia
0	i ’ ll find out about it , break in , and stop them
0	you would oblige me very much if you would consent to talk to me
0	i ’ m through with the past now , through with it once and for all , and i don ’ t want to hear of it ever again , not a word , not an echo
0	you mean with katerina earlier today ?
0	perhaps , when alone with their consciences , they may ask themselves : what does honor really mean ?
0	and how much time was there left to you before he married her ?
0	you will shed a mother ’ s tears for a long time to come , but in the end your weeping will turn into quiet joy , and your bitter tears will become tears of quiet tenderness which will cleanse your heart of sin
0	but i see it differently
0	the circumstances of her birth have never bothered me for a moment , he said
0	she would said that about sergei , who was then lying unconscious in the prison hospital
0	this is what happens at least in lutheran countries , i believe
0	please , inspector , this is most improper , absolutely improper !
0	you say i am in a hurry ?
0	i must make sure , though , whether i really did incite him
0	she 's out of town , in our country house , although it 's been sold now and we own nothing there really
0	believe me , that is what i like most about being on earth—the fact that it makes me superstitious
0	he also listened very attentively when i told him about my meeting with stebelkov
0	he would stop again and again , as if trying to work something out , then look fixedly at me , apparently trying to remember a matter that had some connection with me
0	you don ’ t say—so it was even alcohol !
0	from that look the boy understood that alyosha had no intention of attacking him ; he dropped his defiant attitude and spoke first :
0	but the minute he gets out of it , he no longer knows what he is
0	but they hide it , they lie , they pretend
0	i ’ m so incredibly curious to know !
0	i ’ ve been longing to see you all this time , zinovy
0	suddenly the picture of his other brother , dmitry , flashed through his head
0	some may cry out in indignation at what i have just said and say that i am a sick and hysterical person , that i am exaggerating monstrously , slandering our people , and raving
0	would not a passionate italian woman be good enough to attract a civilized and upper-class russian like versilov ?
0	why is he so nasty ?
0	but , of course , i never told her how i felt
0	you know , there ’ s a lot of rheumatism going around
0	you see , alyosha dear , she said , suddenly looking very playful , as a mysterious little smile appeared on her lips , you see , i suspect , alyosha , and i ’ m telling you this as if i were your mother
0	i don ’ t know how to express it , but a person to whom such questions occur is himself capable of suffering
0	i raised my hand to hit him , but he quickly got up and told me to remember that i was his accomplice and therefore just as much of a crook as he himself
0	the old man was absolutely delighted now
0	yes , it was stupid and awful because i often took it upon myself to reassure him , offer him advice , and i would even smile condescendingly at his propensity to lose his temper over what i called such trifles !
0	his state of mind at that moment could be described as follows : since it was not in his power to regain their respect , why shouldn ’ t he go on and disgrace himself altogether , to show them that he could not care less what they thought of him ?
0	he ’ s jealous while he eats , while he sleeps , all the time
0	she had received two letters from him at first , but now there had been no word from him for over a year
0	and it ’ s all completely natural
0	are you or are you not going to fire the shot to which you are entitled , sir ?
0	as to the mattress his father had mentioned , he had long since forgotten about it and had not bothered to put it on the hard sofa
0	furious , bjoring again turned to the lackey and loudly shouted one or two words to him that i could not make out
0	they ’ re all dried up inside
0	i am sure sofia alone could have overcome the poor girl 's suspicions and she would be alive now
0	i thought they were going to start a riot
0	i have the right to tell you about the humiliation he inflicted on her , indeed , it is my duty to do so , because , when she learned about what he had done to you and about your difficult circumstances , she asked me today , just an hour or so ago in fact , to
0	what could possibly have caused it ?
0	he had it placed on the poor crazy woman ’ s grave at his own expense after mr karamazov , whom he had repeatedly plagued about it , finally left for odessa without doing anything , turning his back not only on his wife ’ s grave but on all his memories as well
0	so he ’ s expecting grushenka even today ?
0	well , you understand what it meant when he said he did not want to see it again ?
0	as he was stepping out of the carriage , the boy came running up from the side , stumbled against the step by the entrance door , slipped , and while falling stretched both hands out in front of him
0	then , suddenly addressing smerdyakov directly , he said : you aren ’ t a human being—you ’ re made of the slime of the bath-house—that ’ s what you are
0	nevertheless , i ca not see how else versilov could have started with my mother , even if he had wanted to
0	yes , and it was not always too clear what he was trying to say
0	mitya fell silent too
0	but it ’ s so terribly important , don ’ t you see ?
0	i will never forget those first moments in europe
0	alyosha was looking at her sadly puzzled , when he suddenly felt a letter in his hand
0	the unexplainable and distasteful news about lambert and his intrigues did not fill me with terror as might have been expected , judging from the almost irrational horror with which , during my sickness and convalescence , i remembered our last meeting
0	the doctor had on his bearskin coat again , with his sealskin cap on his head
0	yes , that ’ s just what i was expecting to happen—it ’ s the truth !
0	i only wanted to tell you something , just a couple of words
0	there 's art that is the poetry of life , there 's the joy of helping those in need , and then there 's her—the biblical beauty !
0	my name is alexei karamazov , alyosha said in answer to his question , but the man interrupted him at once
0	tell me , alyosha said , are you sure it was you who asked him to come here ?
0	and then it will be really terrible !
0	makar 's letters were received exactly twice a year , not more often nor less , and all his letters bore a striking resemblance to one another
0	what makes you think that you know so much about these things ?
0	i leaped up from my chair
0	that 's quite a question you are asking me
0	mr karamazov usually went to bed late—at three or four in the morning—and until then he would pace the room or sit in an armchair and meditate
0	and let me tell you that anna has a very high opinion of you
0	that is my sincere opinion and i hope i never change it , kolya concluded challengingly
0	tell me , then , how did you get there ?
0	he looks down with compassion , his lips form the words talitha cumi ’ —arise , maiden—and the maiden arises
0	she must have sent you a note or something
0	i have one more thing to tell , i must tell it , i must !
0	what would it have cost him to add to that note the words , i am the murderer , not karamazov
0	drunk in spirit , he said
0	what came over you yesterday ?
0	there was nothing left of his familiarity and his faintly arrogant air
0	i like her for that !
0	she ’ s decided to follow your brother dmitry to siberia , while your other brother , ivan , will follow her and live in some town not too far away , and so they ’ ll go on tormenting one another
0	you know , i would have never thought of it myself
0	i would never been to an auction before , i would never allowed myself to go to one
0	i tell you once more that you persist in being irrelevant ; indeed , i believe you are being deliberately irrelevant
0	alyosha was greatly surprised
0	but then he changes his statement : he is not sure , he now thinks he used an old bonnet of his landlady ’ s rather than a piece torn off his own shirt
0	hm of course , a conversation like that could have taken place between them and must have preceded by an hour or so a certain other conversation
0	it only said : to ivan fyodorovich karamazov
0	she ’ ll leave now
0	or hates her with such a passion ?
0	thus , when she once told him how much she appreciated his kindness toward me and his willingness to talk to me as an equal when he was by far my intellectual superior ( that is , she repeated to him just what i would said to her ) , his answer took her aback :
0	have you ever thought of gold mines , mr karamazov ?
0	but i would also like to tell that reader that he knows nothing either , and i will prove it to him
0	it all seems very plain to me , i said ; your peter valerianovich is eating his rice and raisins in his monastery and bowing to the ground while he does not really believe in god
0	after all , when he was in the cell no one had knelt and confessed aloud , so he could not have seen anything of the sort and was just repeating old gossip that he somehow remembered
0	oh , in these instances , a criminal often becomes very credulous and thoughtless
0	during our wanderings , this dear , silent man would buy gingerbread and candy with the coppers he received as alms , and give them to the children we came across , for he could not pass a child without his heart trembling with tenderness—that is the sort of man he is
0	whenever you hear of that sin , pray hard for the sinner , at least sigh for him as you turn to god , even if you never knew him—that will make your prayer all the more effective
0	please go to the door , open it a little , and see if mother isn ’ t eavesdropping , lise suddenly whispered nervously
0	i sewed it myself
0	and all of a sudden i understood something of what was being read in the house of god
0	nor is it from me , his brother , or from anyone but her , her alone
0	she will accept me , plainly and abjectly
0	the only way perhaps to change one 's laugh would be by re-educating oneself , by becoming a better person , by developing the better instincts in one 's nature and overcoming the worse : such a person would probably then have a more beautiful laugh
0	they excused him very quickly , and then it was grushenka ’ s turn
0	in my piece , he comes on the scene , although he doesn ’ t say a word ; he just appears and vanishes again
0	but there 's nothing perfect in her at all , he said , apparently surprised at my evaluation
0	why do you call it a pipe dream , prince ?
0	all right , although there are many things i knew nothing about , i suppose too many things
0	if there ’ s no god and no life beyond the grave , doesn ’ t that mean that men will be allowed to do whatever they want ?
0	he had been in moscow from time immemorial and had taught french ever since his arrival among us
0	perkhotin cried , suddenly sick of it all
0	great sadness , bottomless and total , flooded his face
0	i will give a few excerpts from that letter here , for i believe they express nikolai 's general opinion of the situation and may perhaps shed some light on my story too :
0	nothing , madam , absolutely nothing , i ’ m sorry to say !
0	actually , she only said very few words but it was it was the most beautiful poem i ever heard
0	when , in the morning before i left for my job , my mother gave me coffee that was not hot enough , i grew angry and was rude to her , although i was the same man who would gone a whole month only on bread and water
0	no , i ’ ve never given a thought to gold mines
0	he bowed once more to the elder , and then , turning abruptly toward his father , unexpectedly bowed to him just as deeply and respectfully
0	that 's a good idea , the old man said and hastily reached for the crutch
0	indeed , i ’ m certain she did foresee it but decided to go ahead anyway !
0	i confess i am quite fascinated with that sort of reasoning , but then perhaps it was all just an aberration on his part , an act prompted by that double of his , as you put it so well just now
0	well , why shouldn ’ t he smoke that pipe of his if he enjoys it ?
0	but then i would often seen a certain childlike playfulness in her on other occasions too
0	there 's something absurd in her question
0	on the other hand , although she foresaw a possible impulse on my part to give the letter back to katerina , she felt sure i would do that only under a very special circumstance
0	the only trouble is that i ca not help worrying : as soon as i am alone , i worry
0	i wo not allow myself , of course , to criticize you , although every page raises questions
0	in general , though , you ’ re much more amiable with me than you were last time and i know very well why : it ’ s because of that great resolution of yours
0	i ’ m sorry , sir , but i don ’ t go in for that sort of business
0	he was assassinated outside a paris theater on february ,
0	won ’ t your parents give you a good whipping for coming out with me ?
0	he did it very circumstantially and thoroughly
0	why should i bother my head about what will happen to your mankind a thousand years from now if , according to your own theory , in any case i can not be rewarded with love , future life , or even gratitude for my services ?
0	mitya was in a state of unimaginable agitation
0	however , he seemed to despise women as much as he despised men and was cool and distant with them
0	ah , my sweet little boy , my own little darling !
0	i like people with such strong beliefs , even if they happen to be just young boys like you
0	he awoke very late in the morning—nine o ’ clock or so
0	he ’ s convinced that i ’ m the murderer , i can see that
0	you know , the way monks do—the systematic practice whereby they gradually learn to control their will
0	joy fills with light the plants ’ green faces ,
0	since you are laughing and waving your hands , i suppose i must have guessed wrong
0	the others order him about , tease him , treat him like a flunkey
0	but how did i know that smerdyakov had hanged himself ?
0	otherwise he was a man of crass ignorance
0	i have a rather strange trait : i can hate locales and objects just as i hate people
0	and now it turns out that you ’ re on your way to see her and father
0	he was , of course , referring to the door that you insist was closed all the time that you were in the garden
0	that treatment is a very curious one : it ’ s an infusion of certain herbs that martha prepares according to some secret recipe
0	now they are planning to spend the summer somewhere in the countryside outside petersburg
0	and , of course , i could never have imagined that he would ask me to kiss him
0	if i demand that they throw you out now , they will do it
0	as you wish , mitya said gloomily
0	that 's what i would answer if you asked me about mr versilov
0	i had not seen her arrive
0	just imagine , i have been looking for you at your place and elsewhere , wondering where i could get hold of you—you are the one person i wanted to see in the whole world !
0	well , here we are
0	he has plenty of brains
0	kolya sat down on the bed at ilyusha ’ s feet
0	master ’ s curiosity was hot :
0	we must live according to the laws of nature and of truth , mrs dergachev said from the doorway
0	why it made me so furious i couldn ’ t explain to you , because i don ’ t know myself
0	and another thing i ’ ve come to like down here is taking care of my precious health
0	one more word and i ’ ll have you removed !
0	i was thinking of the gold mines
0	i swear to god she didn ’ t !
0	i wo not be alone , i kept ruminating , darting back and forth like one possessed during those last days in moscow
0	but i predict that at the very moment when you see despairingly that , despite all your efforts , you have not only failed to come closer to your goal but , indeed , seem even farther from it than ever—at that very moment , you will have achieved your goal and will recognize the miraculous power of our lord , who has always loved you and has secretly guided you all along
0	i saw that he was on the brink of madness
0	i bet her mouth would even begin to water !
0	it ’ s just like flax , and so thick !
0	the children were beautiful , he longed to fondle them , but was prevented by the thought : i have no right even to look into their innocent eyes because of what i am
0	about that time he met a beautiful and sensible girl ; he was attracted to her and soon married her , hoping that her company would put an end to his lonely brooding
0	i would say almost an hour
0	kolya for some reason snorted as he said this
0	ah , i ’ ve forgotten the word—children usually like them very much
0	to make a long story short , lambert had understood plenty
0	this is the least forgivable way of being guilty
0	so let us be sincere , all of us !
0	it was getting dark and i decided to go out
0	chimed in still others
0	i enjoyed particularly your pious introduction dedicated to the bishop
0	well , precisely because we are in the presence of one of these wide-ranging natures , the karamazov nature , that can accommodate simultaneously the most contradictory traits and the two infinities—the infinite heights of the most noble ideals and the infinite depths of the lowest festering degradation
0	and so , while alphonsine and i went on our way to lambert 's , mrs prutkov rushed off to katerina 's
0	we ask not only your prayers but also your prophetic insights
0	a hundred and forty gold half-imperials were counted out to me
0	i swear i did not bring her here
0	the train was already there
0	that makes it very convenient for thrusting under people ’ s noses on all sorts of occasions
0	the whole pack was set on the boy and the hounds tore him to pieces before his mother ’ s eyes
0	i went over to him , but for some reason the sight of me frightened him and he rushed away
0	in view of all this , katerina , who had never left her father 's side during his illness , wrote to andronikov , in his capacity as lawyer and trusted friend , a letter in which she asked him to set her straight on a few points
0	she ’ ll pay me back for that , for every kopek of it !
0	he wants to be a rothschild or somebody like that and withdraw into his own greatness
0	he was completely changed ; it was really an unbelievable change that took place in him
0	another example is that story about the english offering a million rubles to zavialov not to put his trademark on his products
0	yours are the only tears i want
0	all lambert did was to fill my glass and to exchange glances with alphonsine
0	please , arkady dear , stop gambling , i beg you
0	of course , there was much that was false in the whole business and it irritated ivan terribly
0	he was a fool
0	but what the hell !
0	it ’ s not right that peasants should smoke those expensive cigars you gave them the last time
0	you sound as if you have him well in hand
0	he howled , leaping up
0	yes , i had a presentiment of everything
0	the most surprising thing of all was that there was guilt in his eyes too ; he would looked at me the way an accused might look at his judge
0	and what if there is no god ?
0	she got up and quickly walked to the door
0	mr karamazov had always liked to exchange a few words and a joke or two at the end of the meal , while he was having dessert , even with gregory
0	do not be avaricious , do not love gold and silver
0	learn to enjoy prostrating yourself and kissing the earth
0	she looked at him in silence , her eyes imploring him , but did not dare to come closer
0	i knew that dmitry was capable of killing , but i never thought that he ’ d steal , while from you i could expect anything
0	so that 's all right-let them forget !
0	through the crack lise , too , saw alyosha ’ s finger and she flung open the door
0	and that ’ s enough now—it ’ s over
0	but , for a moment , i really thought that i would finally succeeded in getting you out of my mind and in being able to laugh at my stupid passion
0	by geneva ideas , i meant virtue without christ , which is the contemporary concept or , we may even say , the idea underlying today 's civilization
0	so now , see , i stake ten rubles
0	oh , he was weeping with ecstasy , weeping , even , over those stars that shone down upon him from infinite distances , and he was unashamed of his ecstasy
0	then she discovered that , on occasion , maximov was quite good at telling stories , and gradually he became almost indispensable to her
0	you dare do nothing—you , a man who talked so big !
0	lise ’ s voice trilled suddenly through the crack of a door to a side room
0	but you had not realized that , arkady dolgoruky , not till now !
0	so then , dmitry was a wild beast to him and had been for a long time
0	listen , he said , i don ’ t really suspect you
0	i go to the window myself and lean very far out of it
0	did you really want to see me very much ?
0	that is , i did give my full assent
0	dmitry said , bursting into a peal of laughter
0	let us be bold , let us even be ruthless , gentlemen of the jury , for it is our duty on this occasion ; we must not be afraid of words and ideas , like those characters in ostrovsky ’ s comedy , who are terrorized by words whose meaning they do not understand
0	please , do not deprive me of my god now , for knowing myself , i am afraid i will rise against him
0	the prince became very agitated and tried to convince me that i had been rendering him incredibly important services , that he needed me to render him even more important ones , indeed , that fifty rubles was nowhere near enough to pay for them , that he planned to give me a raise because he felt he owed it to me , that he himself had made the original arrangements with mrs prutkov , but that they had completely slipped his mind , oh , quite unforgivably
0	no , i ’ ve nothing to say about the money—i have no wish to offend you , misha
0	while she was being questioned , mitya kept silent , his eyes fixed on the ground , as if he had been turned to stone
0	it was pneumonia , he had
0	the only reason i offered him that bet was because i felt like showing off and also because i wanted everybody to pay attention to me
0	besides , you ’ re not legally of age yet and can not dispose of your money
0	what was he talking about ?
0	it ’ s about the execution in geneva , not more than five years ago , of a twenty-three-year-old convicted murderer called richard
0	we ’ re both good and bad , bad and good
0	it 's like a dream , like a nightmare , i said , feeling deeply depressed
0	we used to live on the land , but we moved to town
0	oh , i have got you worrying about me
0	it never even occurred to me
0	within you , that problem has not been solved and yours is a great unhappiness , because the problem demands an answer
0	she said , and smiled at me once again , a farewell smile now , as she went downstairs
0	he has risen from the table because he has seen me , and he ’ s coming over here
0	he fooled me , as if i were a little boy
0	tell her that i have ordered you to keep her here
0	the presiding judge addressed himself directly to the accused , asking him whether he had any comments in connection with gregory ’ s testimony
0	i wish they ’ d let ladies come and watch those duels
0	i will certainly be there !
0	moreover , i am sure i am not just imagining things if i say that at certain moments he looked at me with a strange , even uncanny love , as his hand came to rest tenderly on top of mine or as he gently patted my shoulder
0	after all , we are father and son , and it would be too disgusting for words
0	it was an appointment , but not of that kind at all
0	ah , this is from that hell kitten
0	from alyosha ’ s very appearance , father paisii could tell that a violent upheaval was taking place within the youth
0	but he gave his brother an accurate enough picture , repeating the principal words exchanged , the key gestures , indicating his own reactions by some simple detail
0	which means , to sum up briefly , said father paisii , stressing every word , that , according to certain theories of which the point has become only too clear in our nineteenth century , the church is to evolve into a state , the way a lower order of life evolves into a higher one , and eventually is to disappear altogether as a religious institution , being superseded by science , technical progress , and secularism
0	he often came to ask me for money
0	and you attended miss akhmakov ?
0	their time will come , he thought
0	it was , as i learned later , the door of the landlady 's room
0	he even disgusts alphonsine so she wo not let him come close to her
0	nor perhaps with someone like him either , for that matter
0	and i swear that , if i were not absolutely certain now that i am no longer the same man , that i have gained strength , and that my character has been forged by life , i could never make such a confession to the reader
0	and , above all , let us not be afraid of words we can not understand like ostrovsky ’ s ignorant characters ; let us face our problems as reason dictates , rather than having our decisions dictated by obscure , mystical concepts
0	the servants , gregory and smerdyakov , stood by
0	and so here i am , serving under protest so as to make it possible for things to happen , and acting against reason on superior orders
0	in the morning she got up and started pacing the room with a face all dead and expressionless
0	i keep peering through the crack every minute
0	he 's on his feet again
0	did you see her ?
0	as for the rest of the servants , they slept in the servants ’ quarters in the basement , near the kitchen
0	you have spat in my eye and i feel elated
0	when i first saw him , the sight was a painful shock to me
0	but when you give up your faith under torture , you do it at a time when you have nothing else to do but think about that faith of yours , and that is just the proper time to stand up for it !
0	why , i could give her a suggestion of what she could do with herself if she asked me for advice
0	after a few words from the priest and brief instructions from the presiding judge , the witnesses were led away and seated as far as possible from one another
0	the first to accuse smerdyakov of the murder was the accused himself , the moment he was arrested , and , since that first accusation , to this very minute , he has never been able to offer us a single fact to corroborate his statement , or , indeed , anything that could be humanly considered as a hint of a fact
0	well , then , after seventy-seven defeats , the beggars will wipe out the shareholders , take their shares away from them , and , of course , become shareholders themselves
0	first , the important thing i wanted to see you about is the wedding
0	well , it ’ s almost five years now since kuzma brought me here
0	with that , you might have seen even the gates of heaven wide open , to say nothing of a door leading into the garden !
0	and since the interrogation must take place in your presence , you
0	at first mitya declined nelyudov ’ s friendly invitation to have a cup of tea too , but later he asked for some himself and drank it down greedily
0	they ’ ll shame me at the trial for that
0	so here is what i have decided , alexei , he went on , overcoming his emotion
0	his thoughts had obviously wandered away from the accounts he had before him
0	the boy threw his arms around the dog ’ s neck and at once his entire cheek was thoroughly licked by the animal
0	obediently i followed mother downstairs and out the front door
0	psychology tempts even the most responsible and serious people to create fictions , and they can not really be blamed for that
0	gregory remained silent for a while
0	and what did you step on when you turned ?
0	mrs prutkov yelled at the top of her voice , as if suddenly emerging from total blankness
0	the spectators were still dead silent ; every single person seemed truly stunned , both those who had been hoping for an acquittal and those who had wanted a verdict of guilty
0	and how do you recognize him in a tom-tit ?
0	mais ce nest pas loin , monsieur , c'est pas loin du tout ; ga ne vaut pas la peine de mettre votre manteau ; c'est ici , tout press , monsieur !
0	good heavens , of course !
0	as alyosha left the hermitage , hurrying to get to the monastery ( where he was , of course , simply to wait on table ) in time for lunch , his heart suddenly contracted painfully and he stopped dead : the elder ’ s words announcing his own impending end came back to him
0	i don ’ t think i ’ ll last out another year
0	you wouldn ’ t stay and watch , maria , you ’ d be in a big hurry to get out of there
0	mitya , let them dance ; don ’ t interfere
0	she cried , stamping her foot
0	oh , of course , she may have blushed at first , but then she must have made the necessary effort and listened to what he had to offer
0	mitya felt life returning to him
0	may i come in ?
0	it ’ s a shame they felt they had to drag that flunkey into it
0	i can see right through him now
0	ah yes , that ’ s right !
0	three days later , he left the monastery in accordance with the wish of his late elder , who had directed him to go out into the world
0	but i am not responsible for this foolishness that weighs so heavily on me
0	whether you do or not , he is still a crook !
0	you love him just the way he is , you love his insulting you
0	well , let 's say he 's a sort of religious tramp
0	this is what mitya , gnashing his teeth , was saying to himself , and so it is hardly surprising that he thought he might end up with brain fever
0	everything seemed perfectly clear now
0	it so happened that that morning tatyana prutkov had had to appear before the judge to answer a charge brought against her by her cook
0	but that was a new mystery
0	a short while ago , a witness produced three thousand rubles in cash , claiming that these bills had once been enclosed in the envelope that is one of the exhibits on that table there and that he received the money yesterday from smerdyakov
0	i ’ d rather be condemned as a thief and a murderer before my victim and before all other men , and be sent to siberia , he thought that night , than give katya the right to say that , after having betrayed her , i stole her money and used it to run away with grushenka and start a new , virtuous ’ life with her
0	but what irritated ivan most about the man and gave him a strong feeling of revulsion for him was a certain unpleasant familiarity that smerdyakov began to display toward him , which increased every time they talked
0	and what happened to it ?
0	you are the only one i can rely on now
0	next to him on a little table lay three or four books and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses
0	then , one evening when he came home from his office , nikolai informed me in his usual style , briefly and without going into unnecessary explanations , that i was to call on a certain prince v at his apartment on myasnitskaya street the following morning at eleven o'clock
0	thoughts , though few , seemed on the way ,
0	i can just imagine what you went through !
0	i was wholly conquered
0	i personally feel , mr karamazov , that you are more the victim of unhappy circumstances than a really bad man
0	mamma rushed to embrace me when she learned the news
0	but you did not mean that seriously !
0	for about a hundred paces i followed the high stone walls that enclosed the back yards
0	then suddenly an angry man came rushing out from the nearby arcade
0	he has no idea you ’ re coming
0	versilov being my father
0	i simply can not believe it—i ’ m still in a fog
0	otherwise it would mean that everyone has to be everyone else ’ s enemy in the world
0	he was at least seventy-five years old and he lived behind the hermitage apiary , by the wall , in a dilapidated wooden shack that had been built long before , back in the eighteenth century , for another famous observer of fasts and silence , one father jonas , who had lived to the age of a hundred and five and about whose acts of devotion many curious stories were told in the monastery and in the surrounding countryside
0	when you say something , you go right to the essence of things
0	i detected , however , a shadow of suffering in that smile , or rather something compassionate , reflecting feelings of a higher order—i do not know how to express it , but it is a fact that highly sophisticated people are incapable of having triumphantly happy and exultant faces
0	i saw this thing long ago at mr morozov ’ s , old man , and i got it for you
0	the tsar will decorate me , and when i come here no one will dare to
0	i ’ m a despicable beast , he whispered
0	why , i ’ m sure the monks in the monastery take it for granted that hell has , for instance , a ceiling
0	it is a fact that , for all his passion lor katerina , versilov had always been highly skeptical of her moral qualities
0	mitya pulled all the bills out of his pocket again and found a ten-ruble bill among them
0	that was the end of ivan ’ s misgivings and the mere thought of his brother dmitry became loathsome to him
0	and did he ever mention in your presence , even if only vaguely or when he was irritated , that he
0	so now you know my personal opinion !
0	oh , this is only half of the former versilov : this man refuses to be parted from mother , and i know he will never leave her again
0	for several seconds mitya stared at the old man
0	you might not believe me if i told you that what i did that night could hardly be described as weeping : i literally howled like an animal , something that i would never done before ( or since )
0	mother added , detecting something that might have been a smile on the old lady 's lips
0	ah , hell , what 's the matter with him anyhow !
0	after listening attentively to gregory ’ s dignified and precise account of the erection of the gravestone , he stood there for a while , his head bowed , then walked away without a word
0	our family goes back a thousand years and is as aristocratic as the house of the rohans , but we have not got a kopek to our name
0	well , of course , he couldn ’ t tell you then , but it was precisely about that plan of escape
0	moreover , most people do not even know how to laugh
0	you are right—do not desert him
0	but versilov was already lying unconscious on the floor next to lambert
0	my brothers are bent on destroying themselves and so is my father
0	it is true that they were received in the best society , thanks to their maternal relatives , the fanariotovs , and their connection with versilov 's former friend , the old prince nikolai sokolsky
0	only please don ’ t go provoking people or we ’ ll get into trouble , like that time with the goose , remember ?
0	he did not look at the document that was lying there on the table
0	at last she caught him by the arm and pulled him violently to her
0	what i meant by that , and the reason i said it then , smerdyakov said , was that , although you knew your own father was about to be murdered , you left him there to be killed so that later people wouldn ’ t say wicked things about your feelings for him , and perhaps a few other things as well
0	inside my head was chaos ; nothing made any sense to me
0	he wanted to know what dmitry was like at the time
0	what shall i call you , by the way ?
0	why , makar , of course
0	well , in that case , i am lost
0	don ’ t cry , papa
0	and in the hands of a strong and intelligent girl like anna , he would straighten out and be really happy
0	somebody tried that before and got a bloody nose , they reason , so if somebody else tries it , he will get his nose bloodied too
0	still , the three thousand rubles he would given me in paris—he never even claimed it back from me , never even made note of it , and i , i accepted it
0	while i was telling lisa all this about vasin , she listened to me with a peculiar smile and then commented that whatever had happened to vasin was bound to happen just as it did
0	their severity varied—some were quite mild , others very violent
0	obviously , however , such fancies are bound to be pale , blurred , and trivial ; only transferring them to real life will do them full justice
0	that something was my duel
0	it may sound incredible , but sometimes at night or when there 's no one around he suddenly starts weeping and he weeps like no one else—he sort of howls in an awful way , and , strangely enough , it just breaks your heart from pity
0	after that , he wrote a full confession to the authorities and early in the morning , with this document in hand , he reported to the officer in command of the regiment and informed him that he was a common-law criminal and an accomplice in forgery , that he was giving himself up to the authorities , and that he wanted to stand trial
0	he didn ’ t answer and i only felt his fingers giving a little jerk in my hand
0	just like that : 'guilty '
0	after he had left , mitya kept working on the half-asphyxiated drunkard for half an hour , constantly wetting the man ’ s head , and he was quite determined to keep at it the rest of the night
0	you know , my boy , there are painful memories that cause us real physical pain ; almost everyone has such memories , but most people lose them
0	i could tell you a few things about him
0	i am surprised that maria did not tell you everything herself
0	you ’ re that house painter !
0	i know that now mother often sits down next to him and , smiling meekly , starts talking to him in a quiet voice , sometimes on the most abstract subjects
0	yes , yes , but still she allowed me to open my heart within tatyana 's earshot ; she allowed that woman to listen because she must have realized that tatyana would not miss the opportunity to eavesdrop , she knew that tatyana would laugh at me
0	ah , but if she only knew who he was !
0	after a minute of silence , the guitar resounded again and the falsetto drawled the final verse of the song :
0	yes , you represent russia now , and your verdict will be heard not only in this courtroom , but all over the country , and all russia will be either strengthened or let down by this verdict of yours !
0	those eyes of yours , they ’ re looking at me and saying ah , you lousy , drunken swine !
0	what kind of baby can katerina have since she isn ’ t married ?
0	it makes no difference where you are : far or near , you are always present
0	ivan listened , staring at the presiding judge with his lusterless eyes
0	in the end , however , these people ’ s words reached his ears too , words uttered at first in hushed tones , then gradually louder as the visitors grew bolder
0	she saw how i was shoved
0	fenya , whose frightening experience of two hours before had left her in such a state of fear and anxiety that she could not make up her mind to go to bed , was now frightened almost into hysterics by the banging at the gate
0	where men offer gods no haven
0	do you know where he is now , by any chance ?
0	she belongs to the stern type—a 'young nun , as you yourself once characterized her , or a 'self-possessed maiden , as i have always thought of her
0	you are all i have on earth now , so what will i do if you leave ?
0	i wo not allow them to search me , i wo not stand for it !
0	but enough of this !
0	save us from ourselves !
0	that 's a good wish too
0	despair may be combined with irreconcilable resentment , and , at the moment of perishing by his own hand , a suicide may find his hatred doubled for those he envied during his life
0	i am glad to see you have found yourself a nice place , he said , getting to his feet
0	i don ’ t want you to whip him
0	you ’ re trying to overcome my disbelief in you and convince me that you exist by means of realism
0	and yet i left him with a very painful feeling : i had seen that morning how much he had changed toward me
0	when i was young , i often grew angry when the cook served me a meal that was too hot or my orderly brought me my boots not properly polished
0	it ’ s all right with me
0	ah , yes , i caught a cold , but not here on earth
0	of miss anna versilov
0	so he wanted to kill you , too ?
0	and what about the old man ?
0	well , you ca not imagine how much better a person i become when i am here with you than i am usually
0	he was wound up and trembling
0	no , my angel , miss katerina , i promised you nothing at all , grushenka interrupted , looking at her with the same cheerful , innocent expression
0	one of them was clean-shaven and dressed in the european style , while the other had a graying beard and wore some medal or other on a red ribbon around his neck
0	but i guess god would forgive even an old man if he got to love life out of the gaiety of his soul
0	he suddenly clutched at my jacket and drew me closer toward him
0	he stood up , smiling pensively
0	let it all be done tomorrow at the same time !
0	fyodor karamazov immediately installed a regular harem in the house and indulged in the most scandalous drunken debauchery
0	so that 's all there was to it !
0	it was she who did all the proposing
0	i count on you to remind me of it when i get carried away by other things
0	no , but she was afraid that it was anna who had the letter
0	he knew that katerina lived with two aunts—that is , one of these women was actually her sister agafia ’ s quiet , self-effacing aunt who had lived in her father ’ s house and had looked after katerina with such devotion when she had come home after her graduation from school
0	: he still had not been to see the old prince )
0	once , a week or so before his death , katerina suggested that he invite me , hoping it might distract him , but the mere thought of it made him frown
0	one of them would beat me up first thing every morning and force me to bring him his boots while calling me disgusting names and explaining the secrets of my birth to the great enjoyment of the others
0	if even a boy like you is a sensualist underneath , that leaves very little doubt about ivan , who was born of the same mother and is a karamazov too
0	but mitya sat down of his own accord
0	how can they fail to acquit him !
0	you find it funny !
0	and so touchy too
0	if i decided to come here , it was to try hard to convince you that there 's nothing left that should offend you
0	whenever someone is too close to me , i feel my personal dignity and freedom are being infringed upon
0	it ’ s a bit spoilt by russian nationalism , though : there ’ s still not a single frenchwoman there , although they could easily afford some—it ’ s a very prosperous monastery indeed
0	that ’ s a filthy lie !
0	no , of course not , shell be back in a moment
0	there ’ s nothing new , is there ?
0	even if gregory himself came to the door , the master would only let him in when he recognized his voice
0	i gave him the same version i would given her—i mean about kraft destroying the letter
0	you drive me frantic with your fussing and screaming
0	obviously the pole spoke russian much better than he pretended and deliberately tried to pronounce russian words in such a way as to make them sound polish
0	but there 's something about your face that has stayed with me all my life , and a feeling that it was the face of my mother
0	but tell me , is it forgivable for a man to make a woman wait for him ?
0	the general died soon after his daughter ; they even say that it was his grief over her death that triggered his last stroke , which came three months later
0	and it so happened that , just at that moment , the wife of colonel ferzing , the commanding officer of the infantry regiment stationed in the town , came down to take the ferry
0	yes , yes , that 's right , oh good lord !
0	and kind people come to see me every day
0	i won ’ t wait till he comes back
0	well , so i ’ m a russian too , and i have that russian trait
0	so what could karamazov offer her now ?
0	you couldvc ; copied at least the last page , i said
0	you also like women too much
0	fine , but who are those witnesses ?
0	i was giving you good advice , but if you wish i will bet you on the side that the zero will come up again
0	ah , lise , he ’ s a kind , sincere man , and that makes it all the more difficult in such cases !
0	you must be crazy—what do you mean by 'everybody ' ?
0	and i remembered my brother markel saying , mother , my own dear blood , every one of us is answerable for everyone else , but we don ’ t know it ; if we did , we would at once have heaven on earth !
0	why , do you suppose i couldn ’ t put up with that woman ?
0	but i got there only in time to see her getting into a sleigh that had been waiting for her by the main entrance
0	let us first examine the possibility that smerdyakov did it on his own
0	very good , then , tomorrow i will find among your shirts one with a piece torn off it
0	where could you possibly have heard that ?
0	you mean ivan goes to see him , then ?
0	but be sure to find out all about that horrible child and then tell me , because i ’ m sure there must be some mystery there
0	but i promise you this : when i ’ m close to thirty and decide to throw down my cup of life , i ’ ll come especially to have one more talk with you—wherever i may be , even if i ’ m in america , i ’ ll come all the way back to see you
0	you know what , mitya—i think i ’ ll become a nun
0	what , i ’ ve lost two hundred already ?
0	nor did the pockmarked man exchange a word with the two young fellows who joined us almost at once , although it was quite obvious that he knew them very well
0	papa , he said then , still , you mustn ’ t make up with him
0	as alyosha was turning away again , the boy , enraged , hurled another stone at him , this time aimed straight at his face
0	why are its arms bare ?
0	i knew it was a crime and the realization was like a long , sharp needle piercing my heart
0	well , then i suppose we shall meet again—in the world
0	he thought he would just look around from the porch , for walking was too strenuous for him in his weak state and , besides , the pain in the small of his back and in his right leg was becoming unbearable
0	i would like to know , she said , laughing and crying at the same time , how you can be the guiltiest of all ?
0	why , do join us
0	and , anyway , what could i do if he kept badgering me ?
0	two or three times a smile broke through her seriousness ; at one point she blushed deeply , but toward the end she appeared very worried and turned paler
0	then , for a couple of days before the murder , he had been away from the house without permission , and no one knew where he had been during that time
0	even though he may have decided to part from versilov for ever and ever
0	but bad and wicked though we may become—which god forbid should happen to us—whenever we remember ilyusha , how he died , how we loved him , how united we all were by this big stone , the cruelest and the most sarcastic of us , if that is what he has become , will still never dare , deep inside , to laugh at the good , kind boy he was at this moment !
0	who am i for you to do that
0	he ’ s a different man altogether
0	so i went to grushenka ’ s to give her a good thrashing
0	it ’ s only a little dirty here , by the sleeve
0	the medical officer who accompanied us to your father ’ s house and who examined smerdyakov while we were there told us that he may not even live till morning
0	only the mediocrities , the unimaginative bystanders , are having a great time
0	oh , what a stupid and undignified position i was in , without even suspecting it !
0	there ’ s so much strength in me that i feel i will overcome everything
0	indeed , i confess i do not really know how to define it myself
0	i ca not believe you , doctor
0	don ’ t worry , they know me
0	i spelled it out to him en toutes lettres : he was just stupid and nasty , and the sarcastic grin that was spreading over his face only showed how smug and vulgar he was , for the consideration of the lawsuit had never entered my mind all this time while it had immediately germinated inside his ponderous skull
0	he ’ s damned coherent , ivan thought , and even if he mumbles a bit , i can ’ t see how herzenstube could find signs of impairment to his mental faculties
0	but he was also in a tremendous hurry
0	god bless you , boy
0	all right , let ’ s get going now !
0	that may sound absurd , but when you think of it , it makes sense
0	i had breakfast on vasilievsky island , deliberately bypassing the tavern on the petersburg side where i had had supper the previous evening because the mere recollection of that place with its nightingale had become sickening to me
0	but you just told us that you got that money a month ago !
0	our visitors did not attend the service , but arrived just as it was over
0	i pressed vasin 's hand warmly and ran to catch up with kraft , who all the time i would been talking with vasin had been walking on ahead of us
0	the old man , dignified and stern , stood waiting for him and , as he walked toward him , mitya felt that samsonov had thoroughly appraised him
0	this letter will cost you thirty thousand rubles !
0	for a moment i thought you were talking seriously about the church doing such things as prosecuting criminals and sentencing people to floggings , detention , and even , i suppose , death
0	besides , did not you tell me that you had a broad-minded attitude toward women and did not you even exclaim 'long live tolerance !
0	but do let ’ s go in , by all means
0	but i ’ m strong and silent because i ’ ve made a final and irrevocable decision
0	but for that you ’ ll have to listen to what i have to say
0	neither nelyudov , that boy with whom only a few days ago i exchanged those stupid remarks about women , nor that consumptive prosecutor really deserves my trust in telling them all these things , mitya now thought mournfully
0	good evening , quiet one
0	why had he remembered this later with disgust ?
0	i really don ’ t remember where i got the rag
0	i will go toward obukhov avenue , i thought , then i will turn left and walk all the way to semyonovsky regiment barracks
0	well , of course , there must be certain differences between people
0	go after him , smurov !
0	he started as if frightened and stared at me
0	i had to be back in fontanka around noon to see vasin ( that was the likeliest time to find him at home ) , so i walked very fast , resisting the temptation to stop and have a cup of coffee somewhere
0	despite the fact that her family accepted the situation quite soon and gave the runaway bride her dowry , relations between husband and wife became an everlasting succession of quarrels
0	i ’ ll pull that cassock off his back
0	yes , no doubt about it , the russian mind
0	others replied at once
0	in the suburb where she was confined , there was one dr granz , a man weighed down by a large family whom they paid half a thaler—that 's the position the doctors are in there
0	a frightening verse
0	i have the feeling that these are not really your own opinions that you ’ ve been expressing , alyosha said in as friendly and unassertive a way as he could , but kolya heatedly interrupted him
0	to everyone else this was just a silly little auction , but to me it was the first rib of the ship that columbus would sail to discover america
0	in fact , you make him dance to your tune whenever it pleases you
0	it was hard and was covered with worn , cracked leather
0	as for the chains , that 's another story and there 's no need to go into it now
0	however , the silent treatment i had received from them made me feel crushed
0	i saw him from the door shoving my deck in there and replacing it with his own
0	he loves you , and he attacked me because i am the brother of the man who offended his father
0	above all his preoccupations , like a mountain , loomed the fateful and unanswerable question : how would it end between his father and his brother dmitry with that sinister woman between them ?
0	yes , that was about who founded troy—we heard about that
0	i have often heard about them , but i have never come across one yet
0	instead of the landlord , she was followed by her brother , the young andrei versilov
0	for more than a year , he had been ostracized by society
0	the little pig says froo-froo-froo ,
0	what kind of a schoolboy is he if he isn ’ t flogged , he thinks
0	he does not talk to me—i talk to him while he refuses to listen
0	it ’ s a shame , though , that i ’ m so short—tuzikov is younger than i , but he ’ s half a head taller
0	once ivan karamazov got to know people on the editorial staffs , he kept in touch with them , so that during his last years at the university he was able to publish reviews of books on a variety of specialized subjects , in which he showed considerable talent ; thus he gradually gained a good reputation in literary circles
0	i know you ’ ll tell me the whole truth , mitya , alyosha muttered nervously
0	it 's quite obvious that they are acting in concert
0	but why should she be standing on a chair ?
0	or is it nothing but a piece of fiction , like all the rest ?
0	i bet you ’ re a high-school kid
0	i fully accept your apology , mr former officer , and i am sure that you are a man endowed with unquestionable abilities
0	stop saying insulting things to him
0	and yet he did as she asked him and went
0	yes , i certainly have many of the traits of a gambler and my soul is an unquiet one
0	from certain intonations in stebelkov 's voice , i gathered that he was now dominating the conversation , for instead of his ingratiating tone of the beginning , he had reverted to his usual loud familiarity and i imagined him sprawling on a sofa , as he had in vasin 's room , telling the women long and involved stories punctuated with now note this , and do you follow me ?
0	she asked me , by the way , to reassure you about the escape , to tell you that you can do it with a clear conscience
0	is there really such a thing as rabid little boys , mother ?
0	the stupider , the clearer
0	the house porter opened the door and a lady emerged from the house and started to get into the carriage
0	but i want you to understand that i like common people
0	why , you act like a flunkey with everybody you come across
0	don ’ t cry , mother , don ’ t , he ’ d tell her
0	to be precise , though , it was not actually twenty , but seven
0	katerina akhmakov was standing and pointing at me
0	we thought we ’ d burst our insides laughing
0	therefore he can only be afraid of me , i decided
0	it was as if the ground i was standing on had suddenly been pulled out from under me and i literally fell at her feet
0	i learned a lot from him , for he was a highly intelligent person
0	rakitin asked , immediately feeling offended
0	do you know the story of avisage , [ ] lambert ?
0	smerdyakov interrupted him , but ivan jumped to his feet and caught him by the shoulder
0	when he had visitors , mitya was brought downstairs from his cell to the room especially reserved for visits ; now , when he entered this room , alyosha found rakitin there , just about to leave mitya
0	how much of that stuff would you say you drank ?
0	although he was fascinated by her , he wondered at the same time , with a touch of irritation , why she had to drawl as she did , instead of speaking naturally
0	she was running , completely out of breath , and as soon as she reached him , she let out a cry and threw herself down at his feet
0	i suppose she would had it ready for me for several days
0	versilov was at home
0	finally , he took it for granted that everybody else was just about as unscrupulous and crooked as himself
0	i do feel the same , i do , so please take it
0	versilov got up and picked up his hat
0	as a matter of fact , alyosha was convinced that there was not a man in the whole world who would wish to offend him or , for that matter , who could offend him
0	well , i acted in the most decent way i could and it was certainly not to my advantage
0	did you say kuzmichev ?
0	it takes a while , a second maybe , and then there comes a moment , no , i don ’ t mean a moment—damn the moment—i mean an image , that is , the object or the event or whatever it is
0	but what is there to prevent me from imagining , for instance , that , while sitting locked up inside his house , waiting nervously and anxiously for his beloved to come , old fyodor karamazov might , just to while away the time , have torn open the envelope , reasoning thus : she may not believe me if i just tell her what this envelope contains ; it might be better to show her a bundle of thirty rainbow-colored , hundred-ruble bills in my hand ; that would certainly impress her very much more !
0	and never , never thereafter would alyosha forget that moment
0	i jumped to my feet , quickly found a cab , and , constantly urging him to whip on his wretched nag , i hurried to sergei 's
0	i have never taken part in any political conspiracies
0	then he 's like a dead leaf blown around by the wind
0	but the former soldier just stood there as though he would turned into a post , looking bewildered
0	you know it was last spring that ilyusha entered the lower school , don ’ t you , karamazov ?
0	let other nations stick to the letter of the law ; for us , the most important thing is its spirit , its meaning , and the rehabilitation of the wayward !
0	but when the elder appeared in the gallery , he didn ’ t stop but went straight down to the peasant women crowded around the three steps by the entrance
0	i feel , moreover , that such harmony is rather overpriced
0	it was after the girl 's funeral that the young prince sergei sokolsky , who had in the meantime returned to ems from paris , met versilov in the public gardens and slapped his face in the presence of many people
0	i want you to know , prosecutor , that i thought myself of the scheme you have just suggested to me
0	obviously the small sheet was not large enough for mitya ’ s drunken prolixity , so he not only filled in all the margins but also scribbled the last lines across the top of what he had already written
0	the courtroom became so utterly quiet that one could have heard the buzzing of a fly
0	and if , early in life , they became conscious of the lurking disorderliness and unfairness around them , the breach of dignity in the parental home , the lack of solid family traditions and of a beautiful , fully evolved way of life—it was all to the good because , after having questioned the value of these traditions , they returned to them in full awareness and were in a better position to understand and appreciate them
0	get out of here , dmitry , at once !
0	so what do you say to it ?
0	how did you manage to get all covered with blood like that !
0	and then that strange thing had happened again : he had repeated word for word my thought about living three lives , just as i had formulated it to kraft the day before , using almost the same words
0	the counsel for the defense started like a battle-horse at the sound of a trumpet
0	every principle i consider sacred prevents me from doing what you expect me to do
0	mitya left him and dashed upstairs like a madman to see fenya
0	it is quite natural that you , just like any other young man , might be interested in knowing a young and beautiful woman who readily entertained the local young élite
0	i believe he 's somewhere around here now , in this room
0	he is jealous of his own father !
0	you didn ’ t get married in poland , did you , maximov ?
0	they went downstairs , but stopped outside the inn
0	and i enjoyed cruelty
0	and now you ’ re fooling around
0	and then , on the last note , she faints !
0	love one another , fathers
0	his bearing was deferential but dignified , without the least subservience
0	and in another group i heard :
0	i mean , i could not make myself
0	but , confessing as if to god , i say to you : no , i am not guilty of my father ’ s blood !
0	he realized , though , that it would be even more difficult to transmit dmitry ’ s message to her now that dmitry had given up all hope of paying her back the three thousand rubles
0	by that time the emancipation of women will have become a reality and the new woman will have come into existence
0	i may be accused of improvidence , but at least no one can say that i am not straightforward
0	apart from the hundred rubles , i would be equipped , as i explained , with courage , perseverance , relentlessness , complete self-sufficiency , and secrecy
0	it was father anfim who taught me to love children
0	looks to me like there ’ s some kind of plot between them
0	the church fathers decreed that confession should be whispered into the priest ’ s ear , that only then would it be a sacrament
0	however , despite all available information , i have come here to ascertain the facts personally and now , after having admitted yourself that you are subject to nervous fits , yovi have decided to display your wit
0	mr ivan says , he told me , that everything is permitted in the world , that from now on nothing is forbidden—yes , that ’ s what mr ivan told me
0	the whole thing made me laugh
0	this is really a blessing granted us by the judiciary reform
0	mother also looked quite worried , obviously feeling that something had gone wrong between us
0	but french girls will soon hear of it and they ’ ll come of their own accord
0	so , in a way , the defense counsel may have achieved his objective
0	precisely because , having praised him , i had lowered myself before him
0	his dark-brown hair was short and combed forward at the temples
0	it does not depend on me , you understand , the doctor said impatiently
0	why , have you finally fallen for her too ?
0	no , even if they didn ’ t exist , those hooks , il faudrait les inventer , even especially for me , because you can ’ t even begin to imagine , my boy , all the disgraceful things i ’ ve done
0	and so i could not restrain myself
0	it was the first time i had seen this self-controlled man let himself go like this
0	really , i am sort of split into two , mentally that is , and i am terribly afraid of it
0	the man had been walking around in rags , begging for coppers , and had become a familiar figure in that part of the country
0	i want him here
0	my officer is arriving , rakitin
0	to my great surprise , she told me that he would left even earlier than she had , which must have been very early indeed since she herself had left at daybreak
0	finally , i warned versilov that if the doctor did not leave me alone , i would tell him things ten times more unpleasant than what i would already told him
0	and so she went home very seldom ; she slept outside and the townsfolk fed her , believing her to be a holy fool
0	that ’ s right , i owe it to you
0	she came here because she 's trying to steal something from me
0	i was expecting anna versilov to make some sort of scornful gesture or to give me a humiliating look , as her brother did in moscow the moment we met
0	but , on the other hand , this prince sergei was reputed to be a show-off who liked to play the role of a young millionaire whenever he could , here as well as in moscow , in paris as well as among the officers of his former regiment
0	mitya shouted at the top of his voice , roaring with laughter
0	last april a few guests came over in the evening to congratulate maria on her name day
0	she had a baby by prince sergei sokolsky—a child of her insanity and not of her love , a consequence of one of prince sergei 's most despicable deeds
0	did not i tell you to put on a clean collar ?
0	he was just as sincere as you are , although he spoke in an amused tone , with a sort of bitter humor
0	but i do not suppose you would understand
0	you ’ re just a little boy , alyosha , so here ’ s a piece of advice for you : never ask the woman you love for forgiveness !
0	i do not think that , during the final scene at mrs prutkov 's or even on the previous day , versilov could have had any clear objective in mind at all
0	what 's wrong or immoral about these millions passing from the hands of various jews , all sorts of harmful and unscrupulous people , into the hands of a sober , strong , austere man who watches the world vigilantly with wide-open eyes ?
0	i could see that it was the word jealous that had somehow struck him so strongly
0	did she laugh at me too ?
0	no , please don ’ t decide
0	and once , after he had talked at great length and with great feeling , he suddenly turned very pale , his face became twisted , and he stared at me fixedly
0	you knew , you couldn ’ t help knowing , this fundamental mystery of human nature and , knowing it , you nevertheless spurned the only banner that was offered you , that would have made them follow you and worship you without a murmur—the banner of earthly bread
0	and if you only knew what went on just one hour ago and what sort of prophetic dream came true !
0	on dergachev and the rest , i have no further information
0	you know me , o lord
0	but whatever he does , he won ’ t get grushenka—i ’ ll turn him into dirt before he gets her
0	he said , suddenly beginning to laugh
0	but there are among them some , though not many , peculiar types who believe in god—christians who are at the same time socialists
0	his eyes , small , quick , and shiny , made two bright dots in his face
0	it ’ s he who killed father and stole the money !
0	and i ’ ll go east , away from all of you , and i don ’ t want to know anybody at all
0	wouldo you know , she said then , 'he was trying to insult me
0	i don ’ t want to be here , mitya
0	i certainly never expected to meet a slavophile here !
0	europe has produced noble types of frenchmen , englishmen , and germans , but it still knows almost nothing about the man of the future
0	shouted darzan , interrupting his own conversation
0	that won ’ t last—i know him only too well
0	i do not think so
0	i dreamed incessantly of running away for two months
0	it wasn ’ t far to the church , three hundred yards or so
0	i was always convinced that he would send my relatives the three thousand rubles as soon as he got that money from his father , she testified further
0	i won ’ t be just your mistress—i ’ ll be your true and faithful wife , your slave , and i ’ ll work for you
0	but soon the old crank affected me in an unexpected way , aroused something resembling pity in me ; toward the end of the month i felt strangely attached to him and gave up my plan of being deliberately rude to him
0	rakitin cried , again genuinely surprised
0	do not worry , i will behave , i came with that intention , i said , squeezing her arm
0	he turned to the clerk ; his face very red with anger , and with a strange , shrill note vibrating in his voice , he said :
0	i realized only too well that my words were pouring out like water through a sieve , that i was inconsistently skipping from one thought to another
0	and in no time i was out of his sight
0	the far corner was screened off by a curtain , or rather a sheet , hanging on another clothes line that stretched across the angle formed by the walls
0	what would i do there ?
0	when i mentioned the moscow lady who was almost as beautiful as anna , i tried to make it sound as if these words had slipped unthinkingly from my lips , assuming that such a spontaneous compliment would be more appreciated by a woman than carefully thought-up praise
0	will you never get tired of this game ?
0	i wondered if you did not know something about it ?
0	for even if the righteous in heaven forgave them at the sight of their sufferings and , in their infinite love , called them to join them in heaven , they would only further exasperate their suffering , for that would simply intensify their burning thirst to give the responsive , active , and grateful love which was now beyond their power forever
0	vasin said enigmatically when he saw me
0	she pulled out of her bosom a small embroidered belt , looked at it , and at once began shaking with sobs , the tears flowing from her eyes , which she covered with her fingers
0	you know , prince , sometimes you say the most delightful things
0	you have as much right as the rich and the mighty
0	how did you get in here ?
0	i want to make an educated man out of you !
0	and that old fellow maximov is there with her , too
0	finally i decided that i would ring at the apartment door and ask the cook whether her mistress was at home
0	but that was all a lot of nonsense and i wish you hadn ’ t bothered to come
0	it was almost night and so dark that it was hard to make out anything thirty yards away
0	it started long ago when for the last time i rushed off abroad
0	and that is the kind of person she is
0	i remember the sun suddenly brightening up the room when the curtains were drawn and the crackling of the stove that somebody had lighted , although i have no recollection of who lighted it or when
0	yes , i , the boy without a family , was unexpectedly having a visitor , the first visitor i would had since i would been at touchard 's school
0	i do not want to risk that now
0	i do not believe any of them , except mr karamazov , had ever been in a monastery before , and , as to miusov , it is unlikely that he had seen the inside even of a church for a good thirty years
0	then i would find him more intelligent , was the odd conclusion i finally came to
0	je pense , donc je suis , that is something i know for certain
0	and that would be that : he would take her and they would leave at once for the edge of the world
0	as a matter of fact , they had much more urgent things to worry about than excursions into russian literature
0	what was the reason for this sign which they , like father ferapont , had now seized upon so eagerly ?
0	well , how is your health ?
0	and then , turning to maximov , he added : and you too , sir
0	that ’ s the only thing i want to know
0	he , you see , tied himself to the monastery and almost became a monk
0	shortly after that , he would gone out to look for me , and i will never forget that he thought of me so soon
0	when he acted in his official capacity , however , he immediately became extremely grave as if , at that moment , he considered his duties and his person sacred
0	father paisii performed these rituals and , after sponging the body , clothed it in monastic garb and wrapped it in a cloak which , as prescribed , he slit slightly so as to wrap it crosswise around the body
0	do you remember how you used to beat me up ?
0	ah , how he hates her , how he hates her !
0	he indulged in the sweet things those rich ladies brought him in their pockets , didn ’ t he ?
0	there , i took it out of the case and examined it in feverish haste
0	and now back to really important things
0	from my childhood on , every daydream i had was lighted by his presence , was spun around him , and finally converged on his person
0	the old man at once took the hint and stopped in his tracks
0	trishatov is no scum
0	once we spent the night with some fishermen on the bank of a large river
0	after he left , i stayed for ten minutes and then hurried home as fast as i could , running all the way , and i was terribly afraid of bumping into him on the way
0	i was particularly anxious to avoid meeting mother
0	he was , however , interrupted almost at once , this time by nelyudov
0	he expressed that wish in clear and precise terms , quite briefly and without indulging in a single exclamation
0	although i did read candide in a russian translation , an old and ridiculous translation , too
0	ah , is not it pleasant to think all sorts of rubbish
0	i want you , alyosha , to ask that young lady whom i offended not to be angry with me
0	still , the fact must be recognized—the disgraceful thing did happen
0	none of that sickening lot will ever understand that it would be ten times more dignified for them to keep their traps shut and not pay society the high tribute of asking for its sympathy
0	a child needs sunshine , he needs to play with other children , he needs someone to set him a good example , and above all he needs love , even if it is only a tiny drop of love
0	i always intended to propose to her ; indeed , i am surprised it never occurred to me to carry out my intention
0	oh , i do not wish to go into the details of their relations
0	there were many books around , on the bookshelves , on the desk , all over the place ( there were practically no books in mother 's house ) , and i also saw sheets of paper covered with writing and many letters tied in bundles
0	also , it was noted approvingly that , although he had been in town only a very short time , a mere three days in fact , he seemed to have studied the case thoroughly and acquainted himself with all its finest points
0	in fact , in a sense , they even love the children because of the tortures they inflict upon them
0	after i had told him myself that i no longer loved dmitry and loved only him !
0	that is , if it is established that you have an indisputable claim to it
0	and , to make things worse , just two days earlier he would learned that katerina had agreed to a private meeting with versilov , who he knew was in love with her
0	not in the least
0	actually my regeneration was pretty stupid if considered in a broader sense , and perhaps if it had happened to me now , it would have been quite different
0	i mean the rag you sewed the money in ?
0	alyosha started when he heard katerina call him vanya
0	all right , go now !
0	he and lambert were to wait outside until we would left and then rush upstairs , be let into the apartment by maria and wait for katerina
0	to alyosha , however , her face seemed even more attractive than before and it was a joy to him to look at her when he went to see her
0	they began to laugh and i laughed too , thinking that we were all laughing because it was funny
0	please , mon cher , stop shouting
0	so how could it have come to me , complete with all the details , as it did ?
0	i know that e'est comique mais e'est ce que nous ferons
0	and the one who will unite us all in this noble feeling , the one whom we shall and are determined always to remember is our kind , sweet little ilyusha , the boy whom we shall cherish forever and ever !
0	yes , father , it wouldn ’ t be right for me to go to see her , it wouldn ’ t be right at all
0	my god , i said , you wo not even trust me now !
0	but i am getting ahead of my story
0	but a minute or so later she declared : it is all my fault , because i was leading them on , both of them , the old man and him , and it was i who put them in that state
0	but last night it was something else again
0	don ’ t be so bashful , my child
0	don ’ t give me any more wine , mitya , she mumbled , don ’ t
0	no , i would never dare to stake on the zero
0	maybe we should call a doctor
0	but now , hearing what he would actually done , i was filled with boundless admiration for him , together with shame and repentance for my own cynicism and failure to appreciate his nobility
0	nothing of the sort ever entered my mind
0	nor will be move away from me , because all of a sudden he doesn ’ t trust me anymore and is terribly frightened , and so he sticks close to me
0	she was tall , rather on the slender side , with an oval and strikingly pale face framed by luxuriant black hair ; her expression was not particularly friendly but very dignified ; her age , twenty-two
0	there , the hall porter told me that miss versilov had gone to tsarskoe and would not be back before perhaps this time tomorrow at the earliest
0	the room i was waiting in , the larger of the two , had enough space for a person to turn around in , although it was cluttered with furniture
0	i realize that i have been caught in some sort of trap , she said , but if you really have that letter
0	she thought i would not because it would completely ruin my whole future and i would not be able to start out on a new career
0	well , she simply went over to prince nikolai 's and proposed to him
0	just a minute , please
0	no , you are not being reasonable
0	i ask you , then , who will ever believe you when you haven ’ t got one single bit of evidence to prove it ?
0	but what about the double , the double !
0	once ilyusha asked about you , but he never said anything more after that
0	you see , i found him , took him home , and locked him up without letting anyone see him until the last day
0	i got up too
0	perhaps it ’ s because i ’ m too contemptible
0	i was roaming around , filled with that anguish , and suddenly i knew i loved her in a way i would never loved her before
0	why precisely yesterday evening ?
0	don ’ t you find it awkward to reach it , carrying it on your right side ?
0	just tell her that i do not give a damn about lambert and that if she sends him to me , i will kick him out
0	i found myself in quite an unexpected position and felt at a loss
0	and that feeling took such a hold on me , i was surprised at myself , worrying about what a mere boy thought of me
0	to your health , arkady , let 's clink glasses !
0	hey , kids , kolya said , stepping into the room , what a dangerous lot you are !
0	i wouldn ’ t think of wasting a sum like that so thoughtlessly
0	you see , fenya
0	anyway , there 's nothing so unusual about the whole affair
0	when they had counted it all up , there was eight hundred and thirty-six rubles and forty kopeks
0	but how could you stop a man like that ?
0	then an irritated woman shouted so loudly behind the partition that we could distinctly hear every word she said :
0	and she herself kissed lisa
0	oh , by that time i was already running after touchard with the clothesbrush to flick the last speck of dust off his coat !
0	that is to say , i was lying only in the sense that the letter was actually in my hands and that kraft had never had it
0	alyosha entered the room
0	because i ’ m sure you ’ ll get rich , i ’ m sure of it
0	you put it very cleverly , you know
0	i want you to feel completely at home and , above all , not to be ashamed of yourself , for that is what causes all the trouble
0	astounding news has reached the class
0	i see now that your little boy is a good son
0	he ’ s the best man in the world and he ’ s leaving it
0	money comes only after that , for without a noble idea human society is doomed
0	he watched my expression intently , but i believe he never suspected that i had learned something since our previous meeting
0	his hair was really too white and his face was round and also too white , indecently so , and his skin was like that of a small child
0	then suddenly the rumor spread that it was fyodor karamazov
0	i ’ ve heard in the market place , and your mother , most inconsiderate of my feelings , also told me , that lizaveta went around with her hair standing on end and that she was just a wee bit over four feet ; she dragged out those words , although she could perfectly well have said a wee bit in the ordinary way
0	it smelled of none-too-clean napkins
0	why should such a man live ?
0	i ’ ve become really frightened for him
0	alyosha could not help asking
0	alyosha stood and gazed for a while ; then , like a blade of grass cut by a scythe , he fell to the ground
0	the nephew recognized mitya right away , for mitya had often tipped him , and he opened the gate with a cheerful smile
0	but what i ’ m most afraid of is that , later , they ’ ll say i was his accomplice if he tries to do something stupid of that sort to his father
0	he went up to the table , filled a glass , emptied it and filled it again
0	do you see that tree there ?
0	mitya kept repeating like a man in a fever
0	when i grow up , i ’ ll challenge him to a duel myself , and i ’ ll kill him !
0	listen , sofia , i am about to disappear again , but i am sure i will be back very soon because i will get frightened and where else could i find another angel to cure me of my fright ?
0	that ’ s not what i ’ m trying to tell you
0	get out , you whore !
0	fine , let ’ s go to grushenka ’ s , alyosha answered right away in a completely indifferent tone
0	i did not ask you for money , did i ?
0	he cried out for the last time , walking away with incredibly long strides
0	in addition to them , there were the innumerable male and female proteges , whom he had once helped and who for that reason expected to be mentioned in his will
0	no , smerdyakov is the only one who really knew
0	( i have forgotten the exact wording )
0	had sofia known a bit more about his past , she might have turned him down , even in her situation ; but everything had taken place in another province and , besides , what judgment could a sixteen-year-old girl make , when all she felt was that she would rather jump in the river than stay with her benefactress ?
0	and now , look at the debauchery among us , at our sensualists
0	kolya suddenly freed himself from ilyusha ’ s embrace
0	touchard assured her in an affected egalitarian tone that he made no distinction between the boys , that all those who attended the school were just like his own children , and that he was like their father , that i was almost on an equal footing with the sons of counts and senators , that she ought to understand and appreciate that , and so on and so forth in that vein
0	they knew very well what he was driving at and reassured him : no one had spent the night in mr karamazov ’ s house , except for mr ivan , and everything was all right
0	i did not have too much to say to him
0	and you have no right , really , to demand eloquence from a murderer , he added unexpectedly , his mouth twisting as he laughed
0	well , i will answer for the last time that it 's an immense idea and that there 's a lot that 's new in it
0	then he set out for town , hoping that on the way he ’ d somehow manage to settle the problem that was now weighing on him
0	he screamed like a madman
0	i can still see you , the way you looked then , i went on , so handsome and the picture of health
0	how do you say it ?
0	i don ’ t know , though , it may be in the morning after all
0	she lived there with her daughter , a former chambermaid , who had worked for a succession of upperclass petersburg families until a year before , when she had been forced to come home to look after her invalid mother , and who liked to go about town in her elegant petersburg dresses
0	weren ’ t you aware of that secret ?
0	and so it went until a terrible thing happened : she slipped and fell down some steps—not many steps , only three—which was enough for her to have a miscarriage
0	at other moments , she spoke as if she felt she were plunging into an abyss , as if she had made up her mind to speak her piece , whatever the consequences
0	thank you , my dear ones
0	it must have been the voice of the girl who had rushed out of the room before and run downstairs , i thought
0	and do you know what—i may not even defend myself at the trial
0	and just think , there are so many of them over there , under the ground , hammering away
0	it ’ s all your fault , they said to me
0	i ’ ll come back in the evening , alyosha cried as he rushed out to catch katerina
0	polenov paid for their upkeep and education out of his own pocket , spending , incidentally , considerably more than a thousand rubles on each boy
0	besides , it was not to please grushenka that rakitin was taking alyosha to her place , for he was a serious man and never did anything which didn ’ t have some personal advantage for him
0	i can see that you ’ re in a kind of ecstasy—i love such professions de foi from you novices
0	i want three thousand right now !
0	) , it was not really to save versilov from his madness and give him hack to mother , but rather because
0	zverev had a nasty scornful smile as he asked me whether something frightened me there
0	stop it , mrs prutkov , stop torturing me , i went on , like her , ignoring what i did not choose to answer because i was beside myself with worry
0	of course , he just spat at me , instead of murdering me
0	well , later , to reward that old friend , i am sure you will be willing to make him a little present for his efforts—say , thirty thousand rubles ? —and he will see you through , do not worry !
0	what a man : here i am kissing his hand and all he has to say is all right
0	but don ’ t you think , angelic man , one can tell lies like the one about diderot now and then ?
0	the practical kostya inquired gravely
0	rakitin frightened me because i thought it was mitya breaking into the house
0	at least the air is fresh here , and i ’ m afraid i can ’ t say the same of the air in my house—i mean that in every sense
0	it does not look as if they were
0	nor is it miracles that bring a realist to religion
0	why , i didn ’ t say that
0	particularly , i found none of that peculiar timidity in him that the prosecutor so vividly described
0	she seemed crushed and it is quite possible that everything had become entangled and mixed up in her head
0	should i conclude , then , that you only pretended to go along with her because you didn ’ t wish to hurt her by contradicting , out of compassion for her physical condition ?
0	mitya waited gloomily until the clerk had finished writing and then was about to tell them about his climbing over the fence into his father ’ s garden , when the examining magistrate suddenly opened a large briefcase that lay next to him on the sofa and drew out the brass pestle
0	versilov did not believe he would succeed and told him he was sure katerina would never come
0	he jumped up from the bench
0	through our mother earth entire
0	behind her came the maid carrying two candles that she put on the table
0	so how could he possibly even consider giving me money which would , if anything , strengthen the possibility , when he ’ s crazy about her himself ?
0	where would he get the necessary money ?
0	but the moment he had finished , he almost fainted
0	and this time i detected something evil , vicious , and sinister in that grin of his
0	they told me that he had slashed a boy , krasotkin , with his penknife
0	and you know what , she prattled on , you absolutely must come back and tell me what you find out , what happens next , what they decide , what sentence he gets , and where he is to serve it
0	and kalganov went back into the house , sat down in a corner of the entrance hall , covered his face with his hands , and wept
0	still , i felt it was wrong
0	two young ladies walked in
0	so wait for the three thousand
0	all this burning flow of ideas was being hurled at me in love , but i still could not understand what it was that had suddenly caused him to open up like this and why he would chosen to speak of all people to me
0	he never left her side ; he admired only her ; the rest of the world did not exist for him
0	i ’ ll pay you for the candle , he said , turning to the forester , and also for spending the night in your hut
0	it ’ s not eleven yet , i ’ m sure
0	i have an intelligent face , though
0	there was no one there at the time because mrs fanariotov was traveling abroad
0	actually , it was more of a foreboding than a thought : i somehow felt that the phrase paper romeo was the keynote in her outburst
0	i myself gave only one piece of practical advice when andrei versilov asked me a most confidential question without any witnesses present
0	why are you staring at me like that , saying nothing ?
0	two red lights shone in the darkness and the rattle of the approaching monster increased
0	finished now—good-by to everything !
0	you think i ’ m a vulgar boor ?
0	this homeless old man had stayed at grushenka ’ s ever since he had returned with her from mokroye two months earlier
0	i have a gift of premonition—i always feel in advance when something is going to happen and it unfailingly does
0	i forgot to say that we would got into the habit of having regular evening gatherings
0	she looked at me unsmilingly , perhaps because of the triviality of my jocular approach
0	and if he changed and treated you decently , you ’ d grow cool toward him at once and stop loving him
0	he ’ s afraid i ’ ll give too much of my money to grushenka , if she comes here
0	we walked all the way to his house in complete silence as i still did not feel like talking to him
0	for as soon as a man sincerely accepts the idea that he is answerable for the sins of all men , he will realize that that is , indeed , the truth , that he is answerable for everybody and everything
0	why , of course not
0	it ’ d be my fault , because it was me who told you everything !
0	it 's true that the other boys contributed quite a bit to my eventual understanding—it was a good school in that respect
0	again , of course , he was not there
0	and so i will just state here plainly and briefly that i accept god
0	someone started screaming and then suddenly stopped , she told her companions as they ran
0	then power would no longer be enough ; i would give my millions away—not out of boredom or hopeless despair but because i would be seeking something even greater !
0	do you think bjoring will relish this latest development ?
0	i , for my part , hardly paid any attention at all to maria 's absence ( reader , please note this too )
0	i swear this by everything that is holy in this world
0	i was almost at the gate leading to that yard when i stumbled on versilov
0	still , i must confess it here , because i believe the time has come for me to do so and i feel it must be recorded
0	i mean i want to be praised and paid for love with love
0	it never occurred to me
0	and so we await the decision that will be dictated by your just heart
0	he got up and paced the room , looking worried
0	oh , it 's a fact , i do feel so much better !
0	and you know it very well , i added unexpectedly
0	might we even say that you were acting unconsciously at the time ?
0	the babe , the coachman said to him , and it struck mitya that he said babe instead of baby
0	earlier that evening , as soon as he had left , fenya had gone to the head janitor and beseeched him , in the name of christ our lord , not to let the captain in , either tonight or tomorrow
0	all right , pour me some tea now
0	armed with spear , the hunter crept ,
0	yes , send for them at once !
0	he knew he was staring , but he could not take his eyes off her
0	i was going to his place , but on my way there i saw him outside the plotnikov store
0	terest and apparently wanted me to go on
0	i will remember , lisa , that you turned very pale when i told you i was going to fight a duel
0	you seem to have definitely taken me for a gray-haired version of gogol ’ s khlestakov , but my function is a much more serious one
0	had i known of their agreement , i would never have said what i did
0	there was no lack of warnings and signs , but you chose to ignore them
0	and he quickly walked out of my room
0	did you write him a letter ?
0	moreover , i found he had a benevolent attitude toward me and an evenness of temper that i had never expected and , what surprised me most , a kind of gaiety
0	you ’ re just paraphrasing your elder
0	of course , the conservative elements all over the world will be opposed to that declaration because they will be the shareholders and the creditors of the governments
0	and you must not forget the parables of our lord , taken mostly from st luke ( which i used ) , then the conversion of saul from the acts of the apostles ( absolutely without fail ) , and , finally , the lives of the saints : for instance , the life of alexei , the man of god , and the life of mary of egypt , the greatest of the great , the blessed martyr who saw god , and the bearer of christ
0	peter miusov , who was later to settle abroad permanently , was at that time still a young man , but he was already an exception among the miusovs : he was an enlightened , big-city gentleman , glittering with foreign polish , a european through and through who , later in life , was to become a typical liberal of the ’ s and ’ s
0	well , how did it go ?
0	i lied to you—i like her
0	finally nelyudov left and mitya ’ s clothes were carried out after him
0	the landlord said , guessing at once whom mitya meant
0	he must be with another woman , laughing at me !
0	but the next morning he came out of the house looking black as night
0	oh , i can see that it was rather silly of me , but i was annoyed
0	and i believe that if this kindliest of men became aware that someone was questioning his sanity in public , that man would become his implacable enemy
0	i wonder what he ’ ll say ?
0	but , gentlemen , gentlemen
0	and also , while on earth , i become superstitious
0	altogether , she spent only half an hour in town , but the amount she accomplished in that short time was amazing
0	but the difference lies in the very fact that , in addition to the civil courts of justice , we also have a church that never loses contact with the criminal and treats him like a dear and still beloved son ; and also the church in russia does play a role in upholding the law , even if only in people ’ s minds ; for , although the church does not actually sit in judgment over criminals , they fear her condemnation and thus acknowledge her authority
0	it must be noted here parenthetically that , although katerina was partly responsible for fetyukovich ’ s coming all the way from petersburg to defend mitya , she had never told him about the five thousand rubles mitya had lent her once and about her prostrating herself before him
0	don ’ t worry , doc , my dog won ’ t bite you , kolya said loudly and angrily , noticing the worried way the doctor kept glancing at perezvon
0	no one except his flunkey smerdyakov knows about the money , but then father trusts him as he does himself
0	but that ’ s perfectly true !
0	i ’ m sure i wasn ’ t laughing at him then , for i remember feeling terribly sorry for him
0	here , i have a letter for you
0	although the court has decided to get the case over with as quickly as possible , i would still like to make a few comments , for instance , concerning the public prosecutor ’ s brilliant character sketch of the late smerdyakov
0	but now , as i was walking by , i said to myself : ' i will try to drop in on him—he 's the kindest of the lot and he was there when it happened
0	allow me to assure you , she said , that i for one am not laughing at you
0	but now let 's get on with it
0	attend tirelessly to good works
0	you yourself , of course , are quite irreplaceable
0	i could see right away that it hadn ’ t gone over
0	but once he had decided to go , he felt that he had a special reason for plunging into a bout of unrestrained drunkenness—to fortify himself for the journey
0	and i asked myself : do i deserve to be waited on ?
0	i wept and wept and it was the first time i had wept since touchard 's school
0	come to think of it , those few days in moscow may have been the happiest in my life
0	and somehow it happened that all those who had loved the departed elder and had obediently and devotedly accepted the institution of elders now seemed terribly afraid of something
0	mitya interrupted him enthusiastically
0	he even appeared very rarely in church , and this was tolerated in his case because he was considered a simple holy fool , not bound by the monastery rules
0	how stupid could i be , lisa !
0	but that was not so in this case
0	now he comes to you in your dreams and torments you , but if you go back he will send you sweet dreams
0	he had half the local inhabitants in his clutches , for almost everyone around mokroye owed him something
0	it is strange , fathers and teachers—although alexei ’ s face bears only a limited resemblance to my brother ’ s , i have felt the resemblance in spirit to be so great that to me he has often been that other boy , my brother , coming to me mysteriously as i reach the end of my journey , to remind me of the past and to inspire me
0	i am not asking for the reader 's advice ; i am simply trying to relive that moment of anxiety and i am looking in vain for an explanation of what made me suddenly plunge behind the curtain into mrs prut-kov 's bedroom
0	do you like it ?
0	who said anything about helping
0	but he paid no attention to what i said and kept staring into my eyes
0	and his heart caught fire and turned toward a light ; he wanted to live now , to live and to walk on and on toward that unknown light that was beckoning to him ; he had to start quickly , quickly , right away !
0	and where did you get the needle and thread from ?
0	later , when asked to give an estimate of the sum dmitry was carrying with him then , mr perkhotin said that it was hard to tell at a glance but that he would not be surprised if there was as much as two or even three thousand rubles , for what he saw was certainly a pretty thick wad of bills
0	but tell me this now : how large was that bundle with the bills in it that you had around your neck ?
0	i want to get it straight : crime must be considered not only as admissible but even as the logical and inevitable consequence of an atheist ’ s position
0	to this day , they are all convinced that the atheist diderot went to see the metropolitan platon to argue with him about god
0	do you know him ?
0	i must confess i would not at all like to be a novelist who has to deal with a hero coming from an accidental family !
0	he must come back here
0	in short , there was a lot of talk going around
0	yes , you were certainly counting on mr dmitry
0	could you let me have five rubles ?
0	repentance and despair are two very different things
0	he had in his hand a small but obviously expensive bouquet of fresh flowers
0	this is a quirk found in many people , even very clever ones , let alone the likes of fyodor karamazov
0	i certainly intend to go through with it , my boy
0	oh , forgive me , for i see the pained expression on your face , so please forgive this over enthusiastic adolescent for his clumsy way of saying what he feels
0	so do not let russia down , do not disappoint her expectations , for the troika of our fate may be carrying us headlong to our doom !
0	one of them shouted
0	you can not be received just now
0	it should be added that karamazov was not only convinced of smerdyakov ’ s honesty—he was even fond of him somehow , although smerdyakov made no exception for him , looking at him with the same jaundiced eye as he looked at the rest of the world and seldom saying anything to him
0	no , no , nothing will force me to do that !
0	i have just been to his place and that 's why i have come to you in such a state , shaking all over
0	being just an unimaginative small-time criminal , he had blindly based all his calculations on the document , without bothering to try to understand what sort of person he was dealing with
0	this is the age of railroads , mr karamazov
0	i myself believe that it will come to pass and that the time is near at hand
0	but it ’ s up to you , really
0	and i never suspected it
0	no , i do not need it
0	yet when before burial his coffin stood in a church where he was already venerated as a saint , a strange thing happened : as soon as the deacon began to intone , depart , all ye possessed by the devil , the coffin rose into the air and was hurled out of the church
0	why , i know he somehow found out i had some money and so came rushing here to marry me
0	had not i imagined all the things that tormented me so ?
0	of course i wouldn ’ t !
0	on both of us ,
0	well , that ’ s something a martyr would ask
0	hot and cold waves flooded his body in turns
0	it ’ s a direct , spontaneous loathing
0	they apparently were under the impression that what had happened could still be changed and undone
0	i ’ d bet anything that it ’ s occurred to you before this
0	the next witness to be called was ivan karamazov
0	but i was sobbing myself as i told her
0	i will try now to sum up what followed
0	so this was the sequence of thoughts that passed through my head since i was completely sincere with myself
0	why should an author forego even one listener , after all ?
0	my theory , karamazov , is plain and clear , kolya started off in a hurry again
0	they were also very interested to hear that it was smerdyakov who kept mitya informed of what went on inside old karamazov ’ s house , and the clerk had to write it all down in detail
0	so he gives me one of those dumb looks and says : and what does a goose think about ?
0	my god , i thought , if he comes now and just whistles for me , i ’ ll crawl to him , cringing like a beaten dog
0	my heart contracted painfully when i heard that
0	silence is always beautiful and a silent man is always more pleasing to the eye than a talking man
0	ah , gentlemen , don ’ t you understand that precisely the purpose makes the whole difference ?
0	how dare you
0	somehow it had never occurred to me that makar might not be alone , and now i was quite taken aback to find mother and the doctor there
0	kraft did not know what had actually happened to that letter but remarked that andronikov would never have torn up such an important paper since he was a man not only with a broad mind but also with a broad notion of the permissible—a judgment showing surprising independence , in view of kraft 's close attachment to and fondness for andronikov
0	i love him and i asked that he be brought in so you could have a look at him
0	i fully intend to make everybody laugh
0	i ’ m really surprised at your patience with these people—one can never trust them !
0	and to these questions he receives the stereotyped answer : he gave you life , you are his flesh and blood , and therefore you must love him
0	but hardly had the boy uttered these words than maxim appeared on top of the bank above them
0	in fact , i liked the way you put it about a woman wielding tremendous power , although i am not sure why you had to connect it with her working or not
0	but , anyway , they won ’ t allow her to follow me there
0	there were also in him certain traits that seemed contradictory : side by side with his unbelievable trust , which , to my great exasperation at times , prevented him from detecting irony , there was a certain slyness , which showed up particularly during our arguments
0	he was at once surrounded by people , who never took their eyes off him
0	in any case , allow me to regard you as my best friends at this moment of my life when i am in this humiliating position
0	zosima , placing the stole on her head , said a brief prayer , and the girl immediately quieted down
0	yes , i am nothing but a wretched adolescent who every minute keeps losing the sense of what 's good and what 's bad
0	did you tell him ?
0	besides , i have the weakness of talking without elaborating
0	but as alyosha stood up , mr karamazov changed his mind
0	so when he lay sick , i looked at him and i said to myself : if he gets better , he ’ ll get up and then what ?
0	i must leave in time to visit my brother , alyosha mumbled apologetically
0	and , for some reason , at first i took a sort of liking to the young man , just like the rest of them
0	i ’ ll even think that it ’ s a beautiful exit for a man like me
0	he was an illegitimate child and when he was only six years old his parents gave him as a present to some shepherds in the swiss mountains , who took him to make him work for them
0	but now , if dardanelov ’ s name happened to come up in conversation with visitors in kolya ’ s presence , the poor woman would blush like a rose while kolya would pointedly look out of the window , or examine his boots to see if they needed repairing , or impatiently call perezvon , a large , shaggy , mangy dog which he had found somewhere a month before and had kept secretly at home , for some reason not wanting any of his schoolmates to see it
0	and yet we all knew him—for among us he lived , as the poet said
0	such people as you and i—how could we hold on to money ?
0	that is my private life , gentlemen , and can not be any of your concern , i mean what goes on deep down inside me
0	and with this so that ’ s it , mitya rested his absurd plea
0	you ’ ll be the first person i ’ ve told it to , except , of course , for ivan , for he knows everything and knew it all long before you
0	and wait , if you must , you may reduce the price from eleven thousand to ten , but no lower than that
0	he suggests you mail the money to your sister yourself , and he sends you his best regards
0	and since he didn ’ t do it , it must have been
0	all that is delirium , he said , because there is no such thing as god
0	thank you , sir , i ’ ll be sure to do it
0	i heard nashchokin telling prince sergei , whom he would come to visit this morning
0	his features were twisted into a crazy , questioning smile
0	it was evident that he would come to see us with the purest intentions
0	i ’ ll always come and see you , as long as i live , alyosha said firmly
0	he had merely been given a table by a window that was screened off from the rest of the dining room so that they could not be seen by the other customers
0	for instance , he would stand for hours at the window of his cell and watch the children playing in the prison yard
0	even mother is not in on the secret
0	i would be so happy if you could talk to me about something else
0	his wife begged him and begged him with tears in her eyes :
0	you see , arkady , if i would called you here before , what could i have said to you ?
0	lise shouted now in real alarm
0	the hell with you , i said , pushing his finger away
0	and i ’ m coming with you
0	i jumped up from my chair in indignation
0	you ’ re beginning to get on my nerves , rakitin !
0	and because of this , i feel i will have to insist that you answer the following question : what is the basis for your absolute belief in your brother ’ s innocence and in the guilt of another person , whom you named at the preliminary investigation ?
0	probably at first , he found the shorter pole comical , but soon he conceived a violent aversion for him , as bilious and liverish people are often prone to do without any provocation
0	hey , he ’ s fainted again
0	no , wait a minute , not the father of lies—i always get my quotations mixed up—well , let ’ s say the son , and that ’ s good enough
0	and now , gentlemen , please be seated
0	you know , alyosha , i ’ m particularly afraid of your brother mitya today , grushenka said
0	i got up from the sofa , deciding that eavesdropping was despicable , and took my old place by the window
0	i don ’ t believe he loved anyone but himself , and he also had a very inflated opinion of his own talents
0	pauvre enfant , i doubt that it would be such a boon for her
0	come , see him off as he is about to vanish into the darkness
0	mon ami , voila dolgorovki , i'autre mon ami !
0	the karamazov drive—the vile , earthly drive
0	love god ’ s creation , love every atom of it separately , and love it also as a whole ; love every green leaf , every ray of god ’ s light ; love the animals and the plants and love every inanimate object
0	he most certainly did !
0	through the half-opened door , i suddenly caught sight of someone emerging from behind the curtain that separated mrs prutkov 's bed from the rest of the room
0	and , of course , i can not expect you to pat me on the back for what i did to gregory , for one can not be allowed to go around breaking old men ’ s heads with impunity
0	but she lost her head in her fear and swore ignorance ; she believes that if the accused did not kill her then and there , it was only because he was in too much of a hurry to catch up with her mistress , who had deceived him
0	i drove to see my sister anna versilov
0	you ’ ve heard about that doctor , haven ’ t you ?
0	and i knew you knew i would come
0	i felt as if that letter had been written in blood , a sort of unhealthy blood
0	try to understand that finally !
0	actually , it 's better this way because she loves you too
0	the way i am , i don ’ t mind jealousy
0	the conscientious jury go out and come back with a verdict of not guilty
0	you were the strongest boy in school
0	is not it just
0	kolya , if you say one more word , i will never have anything to do with you again !
0	i need hardly speak of the artisans and laborers , because in our agricultural town such people are quite indistinguishable from peasants , and artisans often even till the soil
0	i felt like hugging and kissing him , but i didn ’ t dare—his face was all twisted and his gaze was somber
0	when i first saw you , i decided that your face looked unnecessarily hard and uncommunicative
0	there ’ s something spiteful and at the same time sincere about you , alyosha said with a smile
0	ordering his driver to wait for him , he hurried back to the monastery , and went straight to the father superior ’ s rooms
0	keep quiet , now , that ’ s enough !
0	you come from tradespeople , don ’ t you ?
0	do they have some kind of ironworks down there , or what ?
0	and although he had been up since early morning and had tried to convince himself that he felt fine , he looked weak and tired
0	indeed , i hate them all !
0	he finally said , as if doing the boy a tremendous honor just by acknowledging his existence
0	he felt a special tremor in his heart and he radiated joy when the elder went out to the gates of the monastery to meet a group of humble folk who had flocked there from all over russia to see him and ask for his blessing
0	because you yourself have given me so much happiness during this past hour !
0	a satisfied gleam flashed in versilov 's eye
0	ah , nikolai , my husband , how have i displeased you ?
0	the butler went out and half a minute later returned to show the visitor in
0	so you wanted to find out , i see
0	there was another possible outcome , though , a tragic one
0	i remember that room clearly and must emphasize that it was not one of mrs prutkov 's rooms , for this is important in view of what follows
0	there were sounds suggesting a struggle and the panting words no , no , i do not want to
0	tell me and don ’ t lie !
0	but alyosha said nothing
0	tomorrow at dawn , when the sun rises , mitya karamazov will jump over that fence
0	and what would become of the criminal , o lord , if the christian community , that is , the church , rejected him and cut him off as the law of the state does ?
0	you must not forget her either
0	all right then , tell me why i am so good
0	all that affected me too and , once again , i decided not to protest
0	he broke off as if he was having difficulty in controlling his breathing
0	when i heard of it , i was so amazed that i almost sent someone to call you
0	i know stepan heard it , and semyon did too
0	but , my god , what can i do about your eyes ?
0	that ’ s true , i said , everything is good and beautiful because everything is truth
0	just show yourself in his doorway
0	and he was a great saint and can not have told her an untruth
0	and , you know , we ’ re not friends
0	i think to myself , may the lord grant them the higher stipend that is so important to them ( because their complaint is justified ) , but the truth is that , if someone is to blame , we must share in that blame ourselves
0	i am afraid i must agree with you , vasin , but i prefer the way i understood it at first
0	yes , that last thought sprang up in my mind by itself , without my noticing it almost
0	then i heard the loud and unrestrained voice of a man just outside vasin 's door
0	you want to have your bodyguard with you ?
0	there would be nothing unnatural , evil , in it : you are worried about that document , you suspect that such and such a person knows something about it , and you wish to find out what he knows
0	when she straightened up , she was beaming
0	for the last time , mr karamazov , miusov warned him again hurriedly in a threatening whisper , remember your promise to behave—or i ’ ll make you pay for it !
0	there were also some amusing stories about our public prosecutor and our presiding judge
0	the clothes he wore were very shabby : an old ill-fitting quilted overcoat with a mangy raccoon collar that was much too short for him and was obviously secondhand , heavy workingman 's boots , and a horribly battered ancient top-hat that had acquired a rust-colored tinge
0	alyosha asked him in considerable surprise
0	and although i ’ m sure there ’ ll be times when i ’ ll desperately want to eavesdrop on you , i ’ ll never do so , because you think eavesdropping is low
0	all i know is that the man in question was much closer to you than you admitted to me , i said , not quite sure myself what i meant by that , but i felt i was frowning and there was deep reproach in my tone
0	and you know what —you are not really quite as repulsive a character as you may seem at first glance
0	you ’ re a coachman , aren ’ t you ?
0	i felt it every time i thought of them , and it was that feeling that told me that what had happened was not good
0	this , however , never bothered him , for he had always considered his mastery of the russian language exemplary and his use of it more correct than that of native russians
0	some people pick out from books nothing but the little flowers , and even then only those that suit them , but they still remain restless because they could never make up their minds in the first place
0	and it ’ s quite impossible to dissuade him
0	alyosha told ivan that , a little more than an hour before , maria kondratievna had come running over to his lodgings to tell him that smerdyakov had killed himself
0	another boy put in
0	you gathered at once that i knew something—you could not have failed to
0	that 's why i had to see you first
0	that is why the idea of service to mankind and brotherly love has been dying out in the world ; indeed , now it is often sneered at , for what can a man do who has become the slave of the innumerable needs and habits he has invented for himself ?
0	and if the discarded envelope was lying on the floor , why can ’ t we come to just the opposite conclusion—namely , that the fact that the torn envelope was found on the floor shows that its owner had thrown it away after removing the money from it ?
0	but suddenly she seemed to become frightened , as though she would caught sight of a line that could not be overstepped , and she cut me off :
0	i felt it coming , but just then peter perkhotin came in
0	these words descended on me with a dreadful heaviness
0	don ’ t pay any attention to him , alyosha said quickly , frowning
0	i couldn ’ t help it , sir ; in fact , i tried very hard to stay out of it , if you want to know the truth
0	i want you to know everything
0	well then , just imagine , perhaps i , too , accept god , ivan said laughingly
0	tell me , are they very angry with him ?
0	indeed , she pounced on me these days more than ever , at the slightest provocation or even without one
0	you don ’ t know about it , my dear alexei , but we ’ ve had a whole plot hatched here , all of us—both her aunts , myself , and even lise—and for a whole month we ’ ve been doing our utmost and praying that she should break with your favorite brother dmitry , who doesn ’ t love her and doesn ’ t even want to have anything to do with her
0	he was also very fond of the boy , although he would have considered it undignified , in view of the circumstances , to try and gain his affection and he was always strict and demanding with him in class
0	granted , this man is a monster , but i no longer dare assert that his is an exceptional case nowadays
0	i have the impression that something has remained unsaid here , something is still unfinished
0	then i went to the kitchen and prepared two tremendous mustard plasters for her
0	then , still without explanation , she went to gregory ’ s cottage where she found the two little boys
0	gentlemen , mitya started , still in the same state of great agitation , that money , gentlemen—i ’ ll make a clean breast of it—well , that money belonged to me
0	i suppose i have a few sins of that sort on my conscience
0	he asked me at one point
0	what 's come over him now ?
0	i ran after them downstairs , coatless and hatless
0	so the first signal—five knocks altogether—means miss grushenka has arrived , the second signal—three knocks—something urgent to report
0	if i have an opportunity later i will relate how anna—usually so proud and proper—had made up her mind to see the baby and how she would met lisa on that occasion
0	so where do i come in here ?
0	young people are the mainstay of our suffering russia , her only hope
0	but now you must go to see those you promised
0	she was leaning limply against him and he was supporting her firmly with his arm
0	don ’ t you understand—that way he ’ d get , not twenty-three hundred rubles , but four thousand ; he might even have made six thousand on the deal !
0	oh , you are so impatient , doctor !
0	within twenty-four hours i can come to hate the best of men , perhaps because he eats too slowly or because he has a cold and keeps blowing his nose
0	the doctor followed his example and mrs prutkov jumped to her feet too
0	i stood there answering the way a soldier on parade ground would answer an officer
0	about a month before the disaster , miss verkhovtsev gave the accused three thousand rubles to mail for her
0	you know , it ’ s funny , i suddenly decided to bang that signal on the window frame , the one meaning , she ’ s here
0	a really wonderful story !
0	why should it stir up such amazement and horror in us , who have seen everything and have become used to everything ?
0	add to this a long , carnivorous mouth with puffy lips and the black stumps of almost completely decayed teeth , from which saliva sprayed every time he opened his mouth to speak
0	so i did not answer his question what shares ?
0	she walked up and down the room for a while and suddenly declared : ' i want to lodge a complaint against that creature , i will take her to courtl ' i said nothing , only thinking what good could that possibly do and how would she prove her charge
0	because cet homme noir
0	your words are frightening , blessed and reverend father , the visitor said , shaking his head
0	and you know what ?
0	when most people laugh , they uncover their hidden vulgarity and thus demean themselves , although they seldom realize the painful impression their laughter produces on others
0	for my part , i ’ ve long since stopped worrying about who invented whom—god man or man god
0	of course , some of the men in the audience appeared to be perfectly cheerful and quite indifferent to what would happen to mitya personally , although they were extremely interested in the trial itself
0	actually , i said , that 's not where i live
0	you ’ re going to perform a virtuous deed , although you don ’ t believe in virtue , and that ’ s what annoys and torments you and makes you so vengeful ’ —that ’ s what he said about me and he knows
0	furthermore , even if such a time never did come , since god and immortality still would not exist , the new man might become the man-god , even if he were the only one in the whole world , and , of course , in that new capacity , he might , if the need arose , jump without scruple over every barrier of the old moral code devised for the man-slave
0	you are laughing at me yourself now !
0	besides , if i am not mistaken , you have already told it to other people
0	he knows more than anyone else on any subject , papa
0	the stock of these notions is , by the way , quite limited and some of them may also be dangerous
0	have you ever dreamt of falling from a mountain straight into a deep hole ?
0	no , he said , it is not exaggerated
0	grushenka asked with alarm
0	watching what was going on , i somehow suddenly thought it was ivan she loved , so i said those stupid things
0	but since maria has not told even you about it , she probably has not got it
0	he went on insisting that she should fasten his friend 's tie and that she should give him one of lambert 's clean shirt collars
0	was he hoping that dmitry karamazov would make enough noise , wake up witnesses , and bring them to the scene of the murder , and then he , smerdyakov , would get up and follow them ( well , he would have to get up then , that couldn ’ t be helped !
0	but i have known of him for a very long time and he has played a certain part in my life too
0	yes , i knew of you by reputation and i did think of you
0	this legend now , it ’ s about heaven
0	what do you say of versilov , eh ?
0	well , in that case you ’ d better wash it off , perkhotin said
0	when the presiding judge asked the accused to comment on this latest testimony , mitya confirmed everything , said that he had , indeed , been pointing at the fifteen hundred rubles he had hidden under his shirt , that he had felt disgraced by it , a disgrace i will not deny now , the most contemptible act of my whole life
0	he felt it would be awkward to go into the inn in his cassock , but he could inquire downstairs whether his brothers were there and ask them to come down to see him
0	my heart is better than my head ?
0	she didn ’ t forgive me
0	but it is the absolute truth
0	did i really want it , though , did i ?
0	you ran down an old woman ?
0	sergei was very agitated
0	then i suddenly thought ( i swear i did ) : why should i have to go on like this ?
0	i wanted to make him feel better
0	so something special must have happened and miss sapozhkov wound up the loser ( or , in my opinion , the winner )
0	i had slept exceptionally soundly and without dreams , a fact i find surprising
0	as long as i suspected you of perfidy and crude flirtatiousness , i was unhappy because i could not associate these qualities with you
0	but what struck me most later—i emphasize that it was only later and not at the beginning—was makar 's impressive physique
0	he clasped his hands together , abandoning himself to his inner terror
0	after stealing the letter from me , lambert had immediately contacted versilov
0	the blood rushed to his cheeks , his eyes glowed , his lips quivered
0	i noticed how energetic everybody around me seemed
0	that give her hope ?
0	who am i to defend you ?
0	the prosecutor wanted to know further
0	he was finishing his breakfast and was about to leave when i arrived
0	that day , when grushenka had insulted katerina and mitya had heard of it from alyosha , he had admitted his despicable act to alyosha and asked him to tell katerina about it , if that would make her feel any better
0	but is it all right if i stay like this , sitting on your lap , for a while ?
0	ah , i wish it was juchka instead !
0	i can see you still despise me
0	this whole intrigue depressed me horribly , but i somehow felt i could not just cut anna down and leave her there
0	but this point will have to be cleared up eventually , and we have all the time in the world
0	fetyukovich bowed , said he had finished , and went back to his seat , accompanied by an approving hum from the spectators
0	it is a fact that i have lied all my life , every day and every hour
0	he ’ s not a man to do a thing like that !
0	i have absolutely no desire to land in the hands of the secret service and then learn lessons by the chain bridge
0	so tell me , how can i make myself most useful right now ?
0	i have talent , there 's nothing i ca not do
0	how could i help it ?
0	ah , she who was so honest and truthful , and i , a blackmailing spy trying to take advantage of a compromising document !
0	to my surprise , stebelkov already knew everything about anna down to the last detail
0	anyway , a soldier has to know how to sew
0	and don ’ t tell ivan either
0	i want us to have a baby boy together and if we succeed that will mean that the boy has forgiven us both , you and me
0	rakitin just laughs and says that one can love mankind without god
0	good god , i ’ m completely appalled at your lack of understanding !
0	that 's how i felt then
0	these women , you can never rely on them
0	but wait , i have two thousand myself and ivan will give you a thousand
0	when i was on the way from moscow to petersburg , i dreamed of you all night in the train
0	i just got there and he was already dead
0	i took it from around my neck , right here !
0	here is the hermitage at last , mr karamazov announced , but the gates are shut
0	i accepted the handkerchief , although i was about to protest that monsieur and madame touchard provided perfectly for all our needs and that we really lacked nothing
0	love for a father that the father has not deserved is inconceivable and absurd
0	nowadays people do not give a damn about general principles but are only concerned with their own particular cases
0	obviously , i decided not to answer them because it was out of the question for me to exchange abuse with flunkeys
0	give it to me !
0	to versilov , for instance , i still spoke like a friend , although with reservations , but whenever one of us would let himself go a little ( and this did happen ) , we would at once both draw back as if ashamed of something
0	and now if someone who had failed to buy that stock saw some of those shares in my hands and offered to buy them off me at so many points above the official rate , well , i would not hesitate to sell them to him at once
0	what was he thinking when he told him that ?
0	he was in a great hurry , answered abruptly and very strangely , but at certain moments did not sound at all like an unhappy man ; indeed , he seemed rather gay
0	i bowed to her in silence and walked out of the room , not daring to look at her
0	she clasped her hands prayerfully , overwhelmed by emotion
0	it must be pointed out that , when gregory made his appearance in court , he was not in the least awed by the solemnity of the occasion or the size of the audience
0	it ’ s not just that it could be he—it is he !
0	perhaps it will work and if not
0	he told them how he had climbed over the fence into his father ’ s garden , how he had stood under his father ’ s window , and all that had happened there
0	i mean , i wo not feel offended , because it would be only natural , i understand all too well
0	my voice failed me , but i whispered the words firmly
0	you have now provided yourself with what we may call a scrupulous account of the first eventful and dangerous steps on the road of your life
0	in our society today nothing is clear , gentlemen
0	i always snort with disgust when i meet one of them
0	they really humiliated him
0	and it goes without saying that they never questioned their right to treat him like that or felt guilty about it , because , after all , richard had been given them as a present , like an inanimate object , and they didn ’ t imagine they could have any obligations even to feed him
0	since you have come out of charity , do something charitable and answer me one question
0	their faces reflected a hysterical , greedy , almost morbid curiosity
0	but i still wonder how the stupid young dog approached my mother
0	ivan felt as if there were a sort of thick fog inside him , but he looked eagerly at the fields stretched out around him , at the hilly countryside , at the trees , at a flock of geese flying high overhead across the clear sky
0	and take my word for it : the public would believe me and it ’ d mean shame and disgrace for you to the end of your life
0	i want to know everything !
0	for a few seconds mitya was like a man stunned
0	and i submit that the prosecutor can find no one else to suspect only because he had , from the start , arbitrarily decided not to suspect smerdyakov
0	the rest of the room was packed with people , but they were not the people who had been at the party , but others quite different
0	and then he suddenly conceived the following idea : the man is dead and now i can save my brother by shifting the blame for the murder onto smerdyakov
0	no , gentlemen , i am too embarrassed to do so , so you ’ ll just have to excuse me !
0	would you really be so awfully kind , madam !
0	do you realize what a great honor that is for you ?
0	he dropped exhausted onto the sofa
0	he was looking questioningly at perkhotin , as though waiting for him to decide what mitya was to do with his own money
0	well , i do not really know whom i was jealous of
0	can you conceive , gentlemen , that , having obtained money in such a shameful , degrading , and humiliating way , a man like the accused could , on the very day he had got hold of the money , set half the sum aside and sew it up in a rag , and then have the firmness of character to carry it around his neck for a whole month , despite all temptations to spend it and despite his urgent need for money ?
0	and this is the most important difference between us and all the others , for we are different from the rest
0	and the same pattern was maintained with all the more dangerous witnesses
0	otherwise , he spoke in a low , tired voice and was in a very weak state
0	i feel pretty certain that the spectators , the ladies especially , were quite satisfied with the spectacle : it was , indeed , a choice one
0	when we ’ re through with all this comedy here , when they decide on the sentence , i ’ ll tell you something then
0	the boys said , laughing
0	he 's some kind of clerk in a lawyer 's office
0	everything was clear anyway : so it was that officer , and mitya had known about him all along from grushenka herself , who had even told mitya that she had received a letter from him a month ago
0	in the letter , he gave her his solemn word of honor that she had nothing to fear
0	feeling her intense gaze constantly following him , alyosha felt impelled by some irresistible force and was unable to prevent himself from quickly glancing at her from time to time
0	but , for that matter , versilov did not go around looking for somebody to lend him money , although at times he would be out all day
0	as to the weapon—well , it could have been , for instance , a rock , as long as it was heavy enough ; he could have picked it up in the garden before going in
0	on that particular day i had come to the meeting full of magnanimity , although i was perhaps somewhat ridiculous at the same time
0	but i want you to understand , gentlemen of the jury , that the only reason i have dabbled in psychology here is to demonstrate to you that you can use it to arrive at whatever conclusions suit you best
0	you were trying to sell me to him and he slapped your face !
0	at that very second all hell seemed to have broken loose in the entrance hall
0	and so i got all the way to the crossroads
0	we have other things to do than joke with you , nelyudov snapped back
0	dmitry said in strange exaltation
0	she told me she had come
0	but i ca not believe that a man would do something like that just for show
0	nevertheless , for the first few minutes i understood absolutely nothing
0	and while there is still time , i want to dissociate myself from it all ; i have no wish to be a part of their eternal harmony
0	i did not like him very much , did not like him at all , in fact
0	but he was no longer listening
0	all of a sudden he looked very drunk
0	then , however , things become more complicated
0	he was so pleased with himself when he came in that he did not even attempt to hide it
0	we ’ re better off having some people as enemies than as friends
0	tell me , my good fellow , what did you mean the other day when , as i was leaving after visiting you in the hospital , you said that if i didn ’ t mention your ability to sham epileptic fits , you , for your part , wouldn ’ t tell the examining magistrate all the rest of our talk by the gate ’ ?
0	well , that ’ s just the trouble—i have no witnesses
0	why don ’ t you order the square swept tomorrow ?
0	that 's a good wish , he said firmly
0	when , after that , he described the moment when he had seen his father ’ s face peering out of the window and , overwhelmed by loathing , had pulled the pestle out of his pocket , he deliberately cut his story short and sat there staring at the wall , knowing that their eyes were still fixed on him
0	i will see what comes of it , i said to myself
0	i expected her to burst into tears , but she did something else
0	what i have just said is only part of what a true father ought to be
0	he admits it to everybody—that is , not to everybody , but to every intelligent visitor who comes to see him
0	can ’ t you give me a rough idea ?
0	it ’ s twelve below freezing
0	'there 's no room for a bitch like you in a respectable establishment like ours !
0	bring him here , she said , meaning you
0	and shall i tell you something , my boy ?
0	that idea crushed him completely
0	they hire out horses there too
0	what are you talking about ?
0	the fanatic screamed , quite impervious to reason in his zeal for denunciation
0	but no sooner had she walked out than the old man 's face changed
0	and i also know very well that sergei could not possibly take such a 'promise ' seriously
0	i agree that there 's no need for us to throw ourselves into each other 's arms , but , without going that far , could not we part with mutual respect , for instance ?
0	all i did was listen to her tell me about her love for him
0	someone will have to take it back home to her
0	in fact , i would made up my mind to cut all communications with them and to move out of there as soon as i could
0	but the most daring crimes are often the most successful
0	would you be so kind as to tell us exactly how you got it ?
0	sweetness of her breast enjoy
0	you know , only yesterday i was thinking : 'who will be the most happy for me ?
0	they seemed to spend their time sitting there and waiting for something
0	if you wish , i can give you a letter for him
0	will we manage to get used to it ?
0	a dead silence followed , after which the foreman of the jury—the youngest of the four civil servants—spoke out loudly and clearly in the stillness of the courtroom :
0	i guess it would be easier to go through with it on a morning like this , he thought
0	very sorry , my boy
0	but in actual fact , as i said , i knew nothing until everything was over
0	i never went in
0	the presiding judge made a sign
0	then some began to criticize openly the recently deceased elder , and even to make accusations against him
0	i saw him yesterday
0	and she was there , asleep by his side
0	and he acted in that way because he was dmitry karamazov and not smerdyakov , because he did not calculate , and was certainly not in a state to think clearly : he was in too much of a hurry to get away from there !
0	well , i like you even without brandy , but with wicked schemers i ’ m a wicked schemer myself
0	he had real pangs of guilt
0	and all that because i had once praised you aloud
0	it 's so pleasant to look at you today
0	her cheeks were very thin , almost sunken , and her forehead was already heavily lined
0	that should be pretty obvious to anyone and any reader with imagination will appreciate how tired i am of having to offer all these repetitive explanations and apologies , which i am even forced to squeeze into the stream of my narrative !
0	you said that living life ' is something simple and spontaneous , something that stares us straight in the face , and , because of its directness and obviousness , we can not believe ourselves that it is precisely what we have been looking for all our lives
0	she hurried to the janitor , who by then had been awakened and was on his way to the gate , and begged him not to open it
0	please , prince , you mus not worry like this
0	and if i ’ ve had some doubts of late , they ’ re gone now as i sit here , expecting to hear words of great wisdom
0	what had made him forget the very existence of that officer almost as soon as he had first heard about him ?
0	mrs khokhlakov hurried out
0	when we got up , i went over to mother , put my arm around her , and kissed her warmly , wishing her a happy birthday
0	would you believe me if
0	will you allow me , madam , to call my dog in here ?
0	finally he returns to town , exhausted , hungry , feeling that he has been made a fool of
0	i have no strength to bear it !
0	and after that , all day long , it was disaster after disaster for mr karamazov
0	quickly , alexei , give me back the letter i sent you yesterday—hurry , because mother will be back any moment now and i don ’ t want
0	i realize now that i still know nothing about it , but if i have found out anything at all , it 's how much i love you , lisa
0	besides , after i advised you to go , you could have either left or stayed
0	i think you even look outraged
0	i ’ ll have them carry me into the courtroom in an armchair , for i ’ m quite capable of sitting up ; besides , there will be somebody with me to assist me
0	waiting for him to come to see you ?
0	at the same time , i assure you , i knew she could see my failings better than anyone else and , in general , i have never met a woman with a more perspicacious and subtle understanding
0	lisa hardly smiled when she saw me , mother was obviously ill at ease , and although versilov did give me a smile , it was a rather forced one
0	my dear , kind , and generous adviser , my only friend in the world , ivan karamazov , who possesses a profound knowledge of the human heart , approves that decision and has praised me for making it
0	for instance , about seven years ago , i arrived in a small town where i was trying to set up a little business deal in partnership with some small local businessmen
0	i seized his hand
0	what was to be done about it ?
0	i used to sit here , hiding myself from people
0	listen , karamazov , i ’ ll explain the whole thing to you and that ’ s why , in fact , i had you called outside—i wanted to tell you before we went inside
0	no sooner was the accused arrested than he tried to put the whole blame on smerdyakov
0	within a short time he opened a number of new taverns in the district
0	ah , what poor judgment on my part !
0	you were just tossing money about for no reason and they were picking it up
0	it 's not right for you to talk like that
0	he still did not believe it when he walked away free
0	i should really say more about him , but i am ashamed to impose any more stories of common servants on my readers
0	very soon katerina divined his secret
0	i am aware of that already , the man snapped , anxious to let alyosha know unmistakably that he knew who he was
0	the painter kramsky has a remarkable painting called the contemplator : a road with a wintry forest in the background and on the road , wearing a ragged coat and felt shoes , stands a lonely , forlorn peasant who has lost his way , and who seems to be thinking hard about something , but is actually not thinking at all , but just contemplating
0	i ’ ll see new places and never look back
0	he was old enough to receive communion
0	he was talking and she was listening to him with great deference and intentness
0	i do not wish to enlarge too much on mr versilov himself , but , after all , he is a member of the russian landed gentry and comes from an old , distinguished family
0	well , i guess you were just drunk
0	but then it turned out that my articulation had been considerably clearer than i would assumed and hoped
0	in fact , he was interested in what i had to say and at times listened eagerly as i held forth on all sorts of subjects ; for , although i was just a young'un ( as he said even though he was perfectly aware that the proper word was youth ) , he always remembered that this particular young'un was incomparably better educated than himself
0	oh , they are in a hurry to love in order to stifle the great sadness in their hearts
0	and it is him that the angels serve
0	but it was all so strange and incongruous that i did not even know what to think of it
0	but ivan had become strangely undemanding in the past two months ; above all , he was anxious not to have anyone about him
0	our work is only beginning , but at least it has begun
0	when they reached gregory in the garden , the two women and foma carried him to the cottage
0	wait , perhaps you will understand
0	but he was no longer capable of such clear thought
0	when he got to his room , he felt as though icy fingers were clutching at his heart , a reminder of something painful and repulsive that was connected precisely with this room , that had been here , and that was here now at this very moment
0	i suppose that darzan knows now , at least judging from his tone last night
0	but then , if he ’ s sitting and waiting for me there , at least he won ’ t come here and that ’ s good
0	what do i think ?
0	that 's what i decided back in moscow
0	whatever else he is , he 's not one of those puppets but a real man who reminds me rather of someone whom we both know very well
0	the most irritating thing about it was that the anxiety seemed completely accidental , external , as if it had nothing to do with him
0	the landlady again appeared at the end of the corridor and stebelkov quickly ran to her on tiptoe
0	we have come to you , great healer , to express our fervent gratitude
0	kolya boasted that he could do it
0	that thought had fascinated me while i was still in moscow and had grown even stronger in the train carrying me to petersburg , as i have confessed earlier
0	you may rest assured of that , but it will not happen immediately , because everything that happens in the world is controlled by its own set of laws
0	alyosha came running at once
0	do you get it now ?
0	i can only assume that she was irritated by the insulting curiosity with which she was stared at by all those people , so eager for gossip and scandal
0	where did you see it ?
0	but we shall come back to it
0	having come to the club alone and finding myself surrounded by strangers , i installed myself at a corner of the table and began staking small sums
0	yes , because they do not dress decently
0	she 's a greek statue of minerva , with the only difference that she can walk and wears fashionable clothes
0	yesterday ivan talked sense about these things , although we were all pretty drunk
0	as things stood , the old prince , under the pretext that it was good for his health , had been whisked off to tsarskoe
0	he was a disgrace
0	well , in the evening i took my son out for a walk
0	you see , we ’ ve come here on private business , miusov said sternly
0	you ’ re a fool , fellow , that ’ s what you are
0	i remember the final composition of the jury : of the twelve , four were government officials , two were merchants , and six were artisans and laborers
0	she was , of course , that hysterical girl i would met earlier in the day
0	ignoring his wife ’ s frightened and hysterical protests that they were the cries of her little baby calling her , gregory went into the garden
0	and in the meantime , during the night , you decided to have a good time—is that right ?
0	it was she who made me understand—oh , not directly but plainly enough , god knows—that the very idea of marriage between us was now impossible
0	alyosha frowned , realizing that he had stumbled on some other visitors , but at that moment the portiere was raised and katerina came in
0	why did he tell him all that ?
0	i was late for dinner , but they had waited for me and were not at the table yet
0	then i ’ ll kill
0	the idea is the main thing , everything in fact
0	would you like me to prove to you that i am not 'your good baron ?
0	the city itself had aroused very little interest in him and , although he learned something there , he paid little attention to the rest
0	the ceremony , as you know , will have to take place here , in the prison chapel
0	i bet that he 's sitting right now in that inn , listening to 'lucia
0	they ’ ve started a card game , timofei said
0	well , not more than five days ago , in a company consisting mostly of ladies of our town , he solemnly declared , in the course of a discussion , that there was nothing on earth to force men to love their fellow men , that there was no law of nature that a man should love mankind , and that if there was love on earth it did not stem from any natural law but rather from man ’ s belief in immortality
0	he spoke slowly , articulating his words clearly , but without rudeness
0	i blurted out unintentionally
0	he appeared on the scene when she was in deep despair , when she was disconsolate after having been deserted by the man she loved
0	although i had never heard any of these legends before , i am sure there was much in them he would changed or invented because for the most part he would heard them himself from simple , illiterate folk
0	how can i leave you like this , though ?
0	tell me everything
0	so they condemned him for that
0	your answer to whom ?
0	i don ’ t want anything , sir , nothing important ; we were just talking , sir
0	he will never be able to endure pain for the sake of his cause
0	he walked with the long , firm stride of a military man
0	above all , i resolved never to go all out for a maximum immediate gain , but always to remain cool
0	they had been in our town for a week already , having come on business rather than for devotions
0	so , as with his first marriage , he asked the girl to elope with him
0	he ’ s like a cloud of dust : the wind will blow and he ’ ll be gone
0	karamazov said again after a two-minute silence
0	so why do not you go and dance ?
0	so that ’ s how she feels , i thought
0	and , you know , she would have drowned herself if that old merchant hadn ’ t stopped her then
0	people in the tavern had heard him , when drunk , declare angrily that one day he would kill her
0	mitya put his hand out and touched it
0	but you were not a bit angry at what i said ; you took my advice as if it came from a good friend , and left
0	mitya roared with laughter
0	i can ’ t believe it !
0	you see , alyosha , my boy , i ’ ll tell you frankly—every self-respecting man is bound to land under the heel of some woman at one time or another
0	why did you lie to him and say they flog us ?
0	master ’ ll beat me with a rope ,
0	possibly he was quite ingenuous about it all
0	i took the bills
0	i said , hoping to resume our previous night ’ s talk
0	the sun was so red as it rolled down the horizon and the sky looked awfully cold and the wickedly biting wind was raising clouds of dust just like today
0	my comrade-in-arms kept looking at me and saying approvingly : that ’ s the spirit
0	it was the landlord of this apartment , anna put him straight , who 's a very amusing man and who seems to know so many amusing stories
0	we will pass over the little speech the examining magistrate made to each new witness about how it was his duty to tell the truth and nothing but the truth , and that he would have to repeat it all under oath later and , moreover , every witness would have to sign his present deposition
0	remember , you even laughed ut me because i read newspapers at the rate of two a day
0	did you hear about the arrest of all those young people on the petersburg side yesterday ?
0	although i held a second lieutenant ’ s rank in that battalion of the line regiment , i was under a sort of permanent surveillance , like a former convict or something
0	within a minute snegirev returned
0	for a few seconds dmitry stood there like a man stunned by a blow
0	many times i ’ ve asked myself whether there is anything in the world that could crush my frantic , indecent appetite for life , and have decided that it looks as though nothing of the sort exists
0	he definitely said no to that
0	who cares whether you are worried or not !
0	i dashed past the landlord , who somehow happened to be around again , slipped into my room , bolted my door , and , without relighting my candle , threw myself onto my bed
0	i admit that i too wept a little , but that was because i suddenly felt so awfully sorry for him
0	i know he 's coming
0	she said with a quiver in her voice that sounded almost like a threat
0	and gregory too , gregory keeps insisting that the door was open
0	he sat not on the bed but on mother 's little stool with only his back resting against the bed
0	she may just have forgotten or something may have prevented her
0	in fact , just at that time , i pulled off something so wild that the whole town resounded with it
0	but perhaps i am such a flunkey , mrs prutkov , that i can not understand how a man can decide to marry another woman when his wife is still alive
0	now i swear on my honor that these three hundred-ruble bills were mine , but at the time , although i was quite convinced that they were mine , i unfortunately could still conceive of the outside possibility that i was mistaken , which , for an honest man , is enough to put his claim in question , and i am an honest man
0	usually it was a bit pale , because of her anemia
0	and there were so many who threw that in my face in moscow
0	but let it be known once and for all that , of all the people in the world , i am the most despicable , the lowest creature
0	it was a deserted lane : no one lived there
0	yes , it was a charming picture
0	why can ’ t you imagine that something like that could happen ?
0	it all depends on who uses it
0	from the very first look he understood that his rightful ’ and undisputed rival might not be so undisputed after all , and perhaps not even rightful either , and that no one expected him to toast them in champagne or to hear his best wishes for new life and happiness
0	when i got to anna 's that day i found lisa there
0	i won ’ t go into all the questions that were asked her or all the answers she gave , but will content myself with conveying the gist of her testimony
0	i had a good dream , he said in a strange voice
0	it may look too solemn otherwise
0	i will be back , he said , smiling at me , and you , the best thing you could do is to have yourself a good sleep
0	the article was devoted to a problem much discussed at the time—the ecclesiastical courts
0	oh , i had a feeling you ’ d help me !
0	i knew it all along !
0	only please do not shout like that and do not be angry , i said , scooping up the money
0	she left the room
0	i left the room in a strange state of exaltation
0	so why must i be the only creature in the world condemned to the curses of all decent people , even to be kicked by them , for when i assume human form i must face all the consequences of it too ?
0	but i would rather not divulge the contents of this correspondence or repeat what we said to each other during our last meetings before her departure : that is a completely new story and , indeed , is still located entirely in the future
0	indeed , it was the only thing that made her happy ; the rest of the time she whimpered continuously and complained that everyone had forgotten her , that no one showed her any respect , that she was being neglected , etc , etc
0	she was trying to save his brother dmitry , who had wronged her , and she was doing it out of sheer generosity
0	you don ’ t expect him to spend the night here alone with you , do you ?
0	here are the wedding guests , the bride and the bridegroom are sitting over there , and there ’ s the merry crowd and
0	for the third time
0	no , i didn ’ t care one way or the other
0	he inquired and started searching with his eyes for the bailiff
0	but how can i know what the most important thing really is ?
0	the doctor said
0	do you think something could happen to me here ?
0	something about the way the priest looked or the way the service was conducted had displeased him , and when he returned home he told us with a quiet smile : i do love god very much , my friends , but i simply have no talent for these things
0	that tall fellow with the long hair ; he had a stall here in the summer
0	mitya insisted in the irritated tone of a child about to have a temper tantrum
0	she must have conceived the idea a long time ago , and i am sure she worked it out with consummate artistry down to the last detail , he went on , drawling his words lazily
0	you must understand , mitya—i was only seventeen then and he was so tender to me and he would sing me those songs
0	why , does that surprise you ?
0	didn ’ t i express myself respectfully enough ?
0	oh , god knew of them too , but i ’ m sure he wouldn ’ t tell you
0	the prosecutor then related the family meeting at the monastery , mentioned dmitry ’ s conversation with alyosha , and told of the ugly scene in the victim ’ s house , when the accused broke in and beat up his father
0	the remaining two-and-a-half thousand you ’ ll receive tomorrow in town , and i give you my word of honor that i ’ ll get it to you whatever happens !
0	she would not say a word for hours ; she would just sit by the window staring at the roof of the house across the street and then suddenly jump to her feet and shout something like if only i could get some washing to do ' or ' i would dig ditches if only they offered it to me , and she would stamp her foot in rage
0	what can you do about it ?
0	she said she still had milk , unfastened her dress , and held the baby to her breast
0	i suppose i will be tried for that and get perhaps six months , perhaps a year ; i don ’ t really know what the sentence for something like that is
0	but he was certainly nothing like what i would imagined and there was something extremely respectable about him , which , in the end , made me feel three times as guilty toward him as i would felt before
0	in the morning , however , i felt more refreshed and energetic than ever
0	to my surprise , he did just that and stood over her , still looking into her face for perhaps a whole minute
0	but it has not been officially proclaimed , and our criminals today often compromise with their consciences in a number of ways
0	and you find it funny ?
0	no , i did not really ; i always loved mother , i loved her at that moment too , but what happened was the usual thing : one always insults first the person one loves most
0	it was the first time he would dared to speak quite openly to me about anna
0	and why is this so ?
0	this is the end of the wayward man i used to be
0	she spoke in a quiet but very clear voice and her words could be understood in every corner of the courtroom
0	i wiped the paperweight clean and put it back
0	could not that have been the reason for her hysteria ?
0	yes , what was it my sister said to me about that baby ?
0	it had many closets , snug little corners , unexpected little stairways and passages
0	why did you suddenly get mad at me , you fool ?
0	that was exactly the reason , though !
0	seems to me , though , that it ’ s a little late for that
0	the blizzard was still raging
0	this encouraged alyosha , who was himself on the verge of tears
0	i was rather surprised , but followed him back and sat down
0	if i hadn ’ t made up my mind so definitely about tomorrow , he suddenly thought with delight , i wouldn ’ t have stopped and spent a whole hour looking after that peasant ; i would have just gone on and not cared a damn if he froze to death
0	all the boys went
0	so he found her in poland , brought her fresh from there , and it was only after that that he handed her over to me
0	you ’ ll see—i ’ ll make life so impossible for him that he , too , will leave me for some other woman , as dmitry did , but then
0	you do talk a lot of rubbish , do not you ?
0	they made pilgrimages to three monasteries and listened to prophecies
0	finally the interrogation of the witnesses came to an end and they began to work on the final draft of the testimony
0	his sincere hopelessness touched me
0	one of the poles answered him from behind the door
0	the striking thing about the prosecutor was his pallor ; indeed , his face was almost green and he seemed to have grown even thinner , perhaps in a single night—for i had seen him only two days before and then he had still looked quite his former self
0	there was another very strong reason for me to leave moscow
0	his eyes were riveted on me
0	out of its case , the album was probably as worthless a thing as there can be : it was the size of small notepaper , a thin booklet with rubbed gilt edges , the type of album that in olden days girls used to get upon leaving finishing school
0	but she told me that andronikov himself was rather unclear about it
0	i knew i ought to have assumed a more reserved , a sterner attitude in the presence of those people
0	his fur coat was really magnificent and he wore a pince-nez
0	katerina pleaded maliciously with the court , and it was plain that she had studied and knew every word , every implication , of that fateful letter
0	alyosha , please come and see me again
0	many people in town and throughout the district started borrowing money from him , on good security , of course
0	i didn ’ t know what you were thinking at the time , smerdyakov said in a peeved tone , and that ’ s why i stopped you by the gate—to try and find out what your thoughts were
0	but now , of course , he has not got one kopek to his name
0	i have mentioned that during that earlier meeting with lambert , the time he would brought me home to thaw out , i would blurted out like a moron that the document was sewn into the lining of my pocket
0	besides , kraft can vouch for you too
0	isn ’ t this both cruel and unspeakably revolting , gentlemen of the jury ?
0	i remember him running after me all the way to the door as i was leaving
0	i have always had the presentiment that they would drive you to that
0	well , once i ’ ve started something , i might as well finish it , he decided
0	and you must give me your solemn promise that , if i let you in , you wo not go bursting into the drawing room screaming !
0	yes , indeed , we can do nothing , and that ’ s the worst of it , kolya said
0	he ’ s her first love and she hasn ’ t forgotten that love for five years , and he ’ s really the only man she ’ s ever loved
0	are you trying to tell me something ?
0	he was fussing about , shouting something
0	i will destroy you , he said in a strange wooden voice
0	i immediately counted off eight rubles to pay him for one month in advance
0	i want you to know , novice , that absurdity is very much needed on this earth of ours
0	i couldn ’ t not believe dmitry
0	but that does not place me beneath you—indeed , i feel i am your better !
0	whom did i give it to to count ?
0	he gave his father ’ s house a wide berth , taking first a sidestreet , then dmitrievsky avenue , crossed the bridge , and entered the small lane at the back of the house
0	i must know the truth !
0	but , believe me , smother this man in mercy and love , and he will curse his wayward past , for there is so much that is promising in him !
0	but since there 's nothing , absolutely nothing , then , of course , one should be allowed to talk , right ?
0	this was the earthly paradise where gods descended from the heavens to mingle with men
0	it ’ s you who ’ s saying that , not he !
0	that 's better , thank you
0	he felt sure that one day he would be an important man
0	i bet she will kick herself for it some day , but it will be too late then
0	you ’ re being insulting now
0	now let ’ s get down to brass tacks , gentlemen , and , above all , stop digging into my soul—don ’ t lacerate it with irrelevancies
0	ah , there you go again with that nonsense !
0	and so that explains your dream
0	my mother reddened violently
0	what are you saying ?
0	anyway , shut up , pretty boy—better put a candy in your mouth
0	she did not see him fall , but she heard him cry out
0	the sting of indignation was deep in my heart and , within a second , i had made a tremendous decision
0	the turn the conversation had taken was quite unexpected
0	i am sure he 's there
0	no , please don ’ t laugh
0	he looked in a very strange way at the man to whose guidance he had been entrusted by his dying elder , who had such great influence on his mind and heart
0	and why on earth should i be so pleased to see you , alyosha ?
0	mitya ’ s face was grim when he emerged from behind the curtain ; he was shaking with indignation and tried not to look at anyone
0	but the bed was not disturbed in any way , a fact that was carefully recorded
0	i have decided to reveal it to the reader so that the rest of my story will make more sense to him
0	he never asked and i never volunteered
0	i liked that and yet it made me sad , but i did not try to analyze that ambivalent feeling
0	think only of repentance , all the time , and drive away all fear
0	but it can hardly have been the only reason
0	what does smerdyakov say ?
0	oh , i am so grateful to you anyway , gentlemen
0	it 's an unbearable sensation
0	the three facts that interested him especially were : that the document existed , that it was in my possession , and that it was worth a great deal of money
0	mr karamazov finished his tea in a great hurry and locked himself in earlier than usual
0	and he asked you not to say a word of this to me ?
0	well , perhaps only a thousandth then
0	it might have affected him terribly in his state of health
0	well , she has a sort of crush on andrei ; actually she even cherishes the hope
0	so it ’ s true then , as they say , that it ’ s always rewarding to talk to a clever man , smerdyakov said with deliberation , looking meaningfully at ivan
0	they seem to know something
0	there were many ways , of course , in which kolya could have amused them more , such as standing them up side by side and making them do soldiers ’ drill , or hiding from them and making them look for him all over the house
0	then she was asked to explain in greater detail the circumstances under which that letter had been written and received
0	all i know is that i , too , am a karamazov—i , a monk , a monk
0	do not you believe me ?
0	he also told me that , although the old man felt a little better , the doctor still absolutely refused to hold out any hope
0	so you see , old man , i have a dog too , he said , turning to lyusha , and then all of a sudden he asked him : do you remember juchka ?
0	he ’ s probably afraid that you ’ ll stand in my way , like my conscience
0	i ’ ll tell you—you wanted to ask me , what do you believe in , or don ’ t you believe in anything at all ?
0	mr perkhotin informed us that when you came to see him you were holding a bundle of money in your hands
0	i informed my family in petersburg in writing through the proper channels that i wanted to be left alone once and for all , requesting that they stop sending me my allowance , that indeed they forget me for good ( that is , if they ever remembered me ) , and finally that there was nothing in the world that would make me enter the university
0	in france i am a frenchman ; with a german i am a german ; and faced with an ancient greek , i would feel like a hellene
0	he seemed to be trying to cope with some insurmountable difficulty : he would suddenly dash up in front of the coffin and hold out his hand to support it , getting in the way of those were carrying it , and then he would come at it from the side and look for a spot there
0	once the deacon ’ s wife comes to see me and she says to me , alexander is the sweetest man on earth , but natalia , she says , she ’ s an emanation from hell
0	but when her lips were almost touching katerina ’ s hand , grushenka stopped as if something had suddenly occurred to her
0	thank you very much , maximov whispered happily , trotting back to the blue room
0	but if you don ’ t mind , i ’ ll take a roll with me
0	the other boys chimed in
0	and that 's how , the next morning around ten as i again started wandering from room to room , i stumbled by chance into your study
0	lisa , who had turned very pale , looked at me and motioned toward him with her head
0	i hope you ’ ll write me from there and that we ’ ll always be like brothers
0	i had some favorite ones among them
0	what i most appreciate in people is wit ; it seems to be on its way to extinction
0	he also prescribed medicinal foot baths for her
0	she said in a voice trembling with emotion and , without resuming her seat , turned toward nelyudov : you must believe what he has just said
0	did he just say—don ’ t tell him ’ ?
0	to propose to her now , i felt , would be rather despicable
0	i am sure that something of that sort is going on in your head and that 's why i feel i must warn you
0	he pulled the folded note from his waistcoat pocket and tossed it on the table
0	in any case , if you find it makes dull reading , do not read it
0	thank you very much
0	so , without any reason or motive other than your imagining that the wretched vasin is your rival , you turned over to the authorities a document that had been entrusted to lisa for safekeeping
0	do you remember , there ’ s a character , a landowner , called maximov ?
0	rakitin had a letter from mrs khokhlakov for him
0	you said something yourself that i found beautiful , i went on enthusiastically
0	i respond at once to frankness with frankness and become fond of someone who is open with me
0	it is not true !
0	that fellow who , last summer , went to town to collect the wages for the whole office and later claimed that he had got drunk and lost the money—remember him , sir ?
0	in their relations , however , it became apparent that smerdyakov was beginning , god knew why , to behave as if there were some implicit understanding between them , and he spoke as though once upon a time they had agreed on something , something that only the two of them knew about and understood and that was quite beyond the grasp of the other mortals crawling in the dust around them
0	he seemed both absentminded and , at the same time , very tense , as if he were trying hard to work something out , looking for an answer he couldn ’ t find
0	no , i never told anybody
0	i know what duty means , gregory , but i don ’ t see why it ’ s our duty to stay here ; that don ’ t make sense to me , martha objected firmly
0	if that is so , it is a mystery that we can not understand ; and if it is a mystery , we have the right to preach to man that what matters is not freedom of choice or love , but a mystery that he must worship blindly , even at the expense of his conscience
0	that leaves us with my client and smerdyakov
0	mr karamazov shrieked in a transport of delight
0	i ’ ve completed my business here and i ’ m leaving
0	wait , let ’ s first go in there , to the left , to the landlord ’ s place
0	i warn you—restrain yourself , for if you start playing the fool , i have absolutely no intention of allowing it to reflect on me
0	and i am not even talking about respect for his human dignity ; it would have been simply more polite not to mention certain things
0	all the freedom he would had before he met her was destroyed and he was chained to a woman who had no particular interest in him
0	perhaps it ’ s suffering and torment that he ’ s after
0	both mother and daughter treated him with the respect due a superior person
0	ah , lise , i know you ’ re just saying that , but i think it would be very good if you really did have a little sleep , mrs khokhlakov said
0	fine , let ’ s have some vodka too
0	he was very anxious to avoid being seen by the landladies or foma , if the man happened to be around , for they were in league with dmitry and might either prevent alyosha from entering their garden or warn dmitry that someone was there , waiting for him
0	but now i want to talk to you about something else
0	you know , i went to see prince sergei earlier today , i mumbled , just to say something , and , by the way , lisa , have you been to see daria today ?
0	i won ’ t , of course , bother to repeat to you all the fashionable axioms accepted by our russian boys—all of them derived from hypotheses formulated by europeans—because what to a european is a mere hypothesis is at once accepted as an axiom by a russian boy ; and , alas , not only by the boy , but also often by his professor , because a russian professor nowadays is very often just another russian boy
0	until then he had listened in silence
0	you already know what a low , despicable person i am , but i want you to know that , whatever i ’ ve done so far , it is nothing compared with the disgrace i am carrying inside my breast this very moment , here , right here , a disgrace that i could stop , for i want you to note , i am completely in control of the situation and could stop it if i so chose
0	he deliberately refused to envisage any other possibility
0	mr versilov , she interrupted me with a bitter smile , my dear father , in answer to my direct question , gave me his word of honor that he had never had any intention whatsoever of marrying katerina akhmakov , and , of course , i believed him implicitly when i took that step
0	i understand that very well , alyosha blurted out quite unexpectedly
0	no , it ’ s not rakitin
0	yes , sofia , and all the fairy tales i would tell you because there was nothing you liked better than listening to fairy tales : you would sit on my knees for two hours and listen and listen
0	for until then , although i would met her when she would come to see mrs stolbeyev , i only knew her enough to say hello and exchange a few occasional words with her
0	i ’ m afraid i don ’ t have it with me
0	ah , katerina is such an angel , a real angel !
0	and i think you were right in what you said about mutual trust , without which , sometimes , it is impossible to get anywhere in cases as important as this one , unless the suspect is really eager and able to clear himself
0	i wanted to give nikolai all my sixty rubles of savings , but he refused
0	listen , arkady , he said , i would like you to order yourself some better clothes
0	he stood up , apparently intending to walk about the room for a while
0	and when young people play at soldiers or at robbers in their free time , it ’ s also a manifestation of the burgeoning need for artistic expression , and those games are often better and more natural than a theatrical performance
0	then mother , also in complete silence , went up to makar and bowed down deeply before him
0	but while others keep their evil doings hidden , he preferred to ruin himself rather than remain unworthy in his own eyes
0	after a minute , mitya raised his head and looked unseeing in their direction
0	so his weekly fare consisted of four pounds of bread and the communion wafer sent to him regularly by the father superior after the late mass on sundays
0	i have thought of these things , i repeated
0	above all , avoid lying , especially lying to yourself
0	and it is on this perfectly natural sequence of events that some people have managed to base their suspicions and to find indications that smerdyakov shammed his seizure !
0	although possibly you have not even heard
0	but why should that concern us , ivan said with a laugh , as long as we have time to settle all the matters we ’ ve met to discuss ?
0	it is full of original ideas , but i think it cuts both ways
0	then he climbs down again and , for five minutes , fusses over the man he has felled , trying to see whether he has killed him or not
0	it was gregory who finally showed alyosha where the crazy woman was buried
0	all her life she had honored , in fear and trembling , her legitimate husband , the pilgrim makar dolgoruky , who had so generously forgiven her once and for ever
0	i am indeed very fond of them , but with you it 's different : i feel at home with you , as with a son , or rather a brother
0	alyosha at first thought he had fallen from sheer exhaustion , but it was not so
0	she ’ s just a little girl
0	may god forgive him , snegirev said
0	maximov at once admitted , with tears in his eyes , that , being so poor , he had accepted ten rubles from mr karamazov , but , he said , he was prepared to give it back
0	hardly aware of where i was , bumping into people , i ran all the way to tatyana prutkov 's apartment without it ever occurring to me that i would have got there much faster if i would taken a cab
0	the presiding judge asked sternly
0	somehow , i do not believe she will
0	fetyukovich pursued this line of questioning , although the presiding judge was stirring disapprovingly in his chair
0	shouldn ’ t i send for herzenstube ?
0	alyosha heard a tender , almost too caressing voice
0	in fact , he had completely forgotten about her
0	but in no time i was transferred to the prince 's private study upstairs and often sat there without any accounts or ledgers in front of me to keep up appearances
0	the dog has a pink ribbon under his mattress
0	two months ago , i stood here behind the curtain while you were telling mrs prutkov , you know , about that letter
0	how is it yours by right ?
0	kolya couldn ’ t help bragging
0	therefore , whatever was left from your papa would then be divided in half between you and mr alexei and your shares would grow from forty to sixty thousand apiece
0	but i would like to question this too : was it really he who killed his father ?
0	you mean world history ?
0	i recognized my visitor the very second she came in , although i had not seen mother since the time she would taken me to the village church and the dove had flown across under the cupola
0	i see you are laughing , gentlemen of the jury
0	but i believe she was mad too
0	so pray for me today , please
0	i want you to like him , mr karamazov said , now visibly drunk
0	let them all fend for themselves
0	meanwhile she had made perkhotin sit down and herself sat facing him
0	he sounded rather apologetic , almost ashamed
0	and do you see those oats dropping out of the sack and that goose over there with its neck stretched out right under the wheel , pecking the grain—do you see it ?
0	now i would like to find out whether this man is trustworthy
0	the thing was the result of a brainstorm of the old prince , an avalanche of ideas that he was preparing to present to the shareholders ' committee
0	well , that ’ s the whole story
0	since you are stronger than an old woman , what 's there to stop you ?
0	but the worst of it was that what made him suffer most during that month was his pride , but we shall return to that later
0	he never made the slightest allusion to you know what , tu comprends
0	why , andrei , of course
0	but there ’ s nothing like that in our monastery—no monastery wives although there are two hundred monks
0	he promised to come here straight from the courtroom
0	a whole minute passed
0	so i stood there like a lost soul while the sun shone , the little leaves shimmered gaily in the light , and the birds praised the lord
0	i simply beseech you to go and see lise , find out everything from her , as only you can do , and then come and tell me , her mother , what ’ s going on , for you must understand that it will kill me , yes , actually kill me , if things continue like this
0	she stopped by the front door
0	but then dmitry himself had told him the day before that he welcomed ivan ’ s interest in katerina , that it was very helpful to him in many respects
0	why , you ’ ve seen her
0	let there be no pride on my part or distrust on his
0	the next day i drank quite a bit in my misery and , i confess , there are many things i don ’ t remember
0	it was tantalizingly painful because he could not quite put his finger on it
0	ivan removed his coat and threw it on the bench
0	to make further developments clearer , i would better say a few words about that now
0	i was stunned and outraged
0	do you remember the sarcasm in which the prosecution indulged , about the filial respect ’ and discretion ’ that are supposed to have suddenly come over the accused ?
0	why did he drive me into such a frenzy ?
0	but why are you trying to justify yourself , arkady ?
0	i have grown very fond of her , very fond
0	in the doorway leading to the room on the right was a table which barred access to that room : the items listed for sale lay on that table
0	tatyana prutkov was playing a strange role when i saw her in petersburg
0	but then later i learned the real reason
0	he doesn ’ t despise anyone
0	he is expected to solve them somehow or other and to climb dry out of the water
0	later , when i remembered my dealings with kraft , i thought with wonderment of his ability to give so much selfless attention to other people 's business at a time so critical for him and to explain so clearly and calmly things that did not concern him
0	the girl died after an illness that lasted a fortnight
0	what ’ s the good of trying to talk to people like you !
0	well , sure , ivan fell in love with her and he still loves her , and now i realize it was a blunder on my part , a blunder , that is , in the worldly , conventional sense , but perhaps that blunder will save us all yet !
0	mrs prutkov shrieked , shaking all over in a paroxysm of wild fury
0	as for stopping mr dmitry from getting in when he hears him come , gregory , i must tell you , has been sick since yesterday and martha is planning to give him her treatment tomorrow
0	with what wild impatience i planned a whole new life for us—how , gradually and methodically , by patient effort , i would dispel the constant fear she had of me , how i would make her become aware of her own real worth and point out to her the many aspects in which she was my superior !
0	here i am , an untalented bastard , who is , nevertheless , your superior because you accept the fact yourselves !
0	besides , i know in advance everything you ’ re going to say to me , as i told you before
0	the visitors left their carriages outside the monastery wall , near an inn , and entered the gates on foot
0	yes , we ought to make clear that it was not our fault , ivan said , and besides , my father won ’ t be there
0	therefore , she thought , all she had to do was to forestall that circumstance and beat katerina to it by subjecting me to that sudden , overwhelming confrontation
0	well , then , it was by this beard of mine that your dear brother dmitry decided to pull me out of the inn
0	but i wo not accept that money from you unless we embrace and kiss first , as we did after we quarreled before
0	then he made a spitting sound and went toward his carriage , repeating , well , i ’ ll be—i ’ ll be—i ’ ll be
0	i am not that good at coining derisive nicknames
0	he was hard as flint and so stingy that , despite his passion for grushenka , without whom he could not live ( and this was especially so in the last two years ) , he still would not give her any substantial capital ; even when she threatened to leave him unless he gave her a large sum , he still never yielded
0	he has a plan , though
0	i do not care if depraved old debauchees run after these creatures with their tongues hanging out , but there is such a thing as the purity of youth and that must be protected !
0	even if you should die , he told me , at least you ’ ll know the disease that killed you !
0	in general , when i am in the company of such people , so as not to appear overawed , i tend to become unduly abrupt , which , of course , is not the right way to behave
0	he had recovered and was staying in ems with his daughter by his first marriage
0	later , the most reasonable of our monks could not remember the events of that day without horror and amazement , wondering how the public scandal could have reached such incredible proportions
0	i was not thinking about myself , i would never use it
0	as of this moment , his refusal has already been registered in the form of an official document , in which versilov emphasizes that he merely acknowledges the legitimacy of the sokolskys ' claim and that his gesture should not in any way be interpreted as a present to them
0	it all seemed so reasonable when i was on my way here , and now it makes no sense
0	it ’ s the act of an animal who is unable to control his animal impulses
0	he ’ s planted himself on the pleasures of the flesh as if they were a solid rock
0	katerina was an object of particular interest
0	thus my gambling ended in disaster , but the night was not over yet and here 's what i remember of it
0	it ’ s in that petersburg paper called rumors
0	the poor people have been burnt out
0	the pestle fell a couple of steps from gregory on the gravel path , where it was certain to attract attention
0	perhaps he ’ s hidden somewhere , watching
0	of course , this was not the coming in which he had promised to appear in all his heavenly glory at the end of time and which would be as sudden as a bolt of lightning cutting the sky from east to west
0	and if stern fate has deprived you of your nose now , then , for one thing , no one will be able to tell you in the future that you ’ ve had your nose pulled !
0	moreover , the young man exercised an obvious influence on his father , who sometimes almost seemed as if he would heed his advice
0	first , if there was no other way , he would try to act in concert with me , offering me half the profits , having , of course , assured himself beforehand that i was fully under his control , both mentally and physically
0	as soon as grusha and i get there , we ’ ll move somewhere far out of the way , where there is nothing but wild bears , and we ’ ll settle on the land , and till the soil
0	the grateful lady said , pointing to kolya
0	on his right , also sitting beside a bed , was another girl—a pitiful creature of about twenty
0	i did not do it with any evil intent , just out of complete thoughtlessness
0	did you tell them something about me ?
0	tell me , did you really think i didn ’ t love you when i told you that my yesterday ’ s letter was a joke ?
0	ivan and miusov would come out of curiosity , perhaps of the crudest sort , and his father might very easily be planning some piece of buffoonery which would turn the whole thing into a farce
0	she did not know that this time it was quite different !
0	the very thought even made him cry
0	the impression she had left on him was that of a beautiful , haughty , and domineering young woman
0	all the signs of a wicked , pettily supercilious nature
0	i swear , i ’ m really scared
0	because by that time god himself had stripped me of my christianity , just for having thought it , before i even said one word to them
0	although i was not so terribly distressed by his death , it was nevertheless a violent shock to me
0	youth is pure just because it is youth
0	we shall tell them that every sin they commit with our permission can be expiated , that we allow them to sin because we love them , and that we shall take upon ourselves the punishment for their acts
0	in the living room , for instance , there was quite a nice china lamp , and on the wall hung an excellent large engraving of the sistine madonna ; on the opposite wall was a huge and probably expensive photograph of the bronze gates of the cathedral of florence
0	is it completely hopeless ?
0	i actually thought the two of them would come to blows
0	the visitor exclaimed , jumping up from his seat and flicking drops of tea from his clothes
0	when he reached the crossroads , the figure leaped toward him , shouting in a fierce , threatening voice :
0	he died in the third week after easter
0	ivan said peremptorily , sitting down again
0	he only met and got to know the old man when he came to our town to demand an accounting of the estate left him by his mother
0	lisa , like me , also knew nothing about the agreement
0	not in the least , although i might as well admit that at the beginning i was rather taken aback and was on the point of answering you in the same vein
0	her eyes were slightly inflamed and her face was pale and sallow
0	i shall love you , you know that , katya , dmitry said , breathing heavily between words
0	gaiety was a favorite word of his and he often used it
0	and nowadays some of these heathens say there ’ s no need to fast all that much ; that ’ s insolent , heathen talk , that ’ s what it is !
0	fyodor karamazov did not object to this ; in fact , he found it rather amusing
0	over his head was the vast vault of the sky , studded with shining , silent stars
0	ivan remained silent for a moment and suddenly his face grew very sad
0	and you should have heard the way he went on , taking the poem to pieces !
0	you came here from moscow with the intention of putting us into our proper place , and so far that 's all we know about your plans
0	' i am just looking at this little stone , your honor
0	then followed a whole series of letters , one a day , all just as pompous and florid as before and differing from each other only in the rapidly decreasing figure of the loan requested , until it became a mere one hundred rubles , then twenty-five , then ten , and then a letter came in which each polish gentleman asked her for a loan of one ruble ; it was accompanied by a receipt signed jointly by both
0	yes , it is the most terrible thing there is , to shed the blood of one ’ s father , the blood of the man who gave you life , who loved you , who would have given his life for you when you were a small child , who suffered through all your misery , who was unhappy through your unhappiness , and who rejoiced only in your joy and success !
0	oh , i ’ m so afraid of that !
0	you ’ re sure you won ’ t be angry if i tell you ?
0	on the head , he put a cowl bearing an orthodox cross
0	her father , who had also been a serf and was under some obligation to makar , whom he greatly respected , had asked for him as he lay dying and , in the presence of the priest and the assembled servants , had pointed meaningfully to his daughter and said to makar : bring her up and take her as your wife
0	do you really consider me that low then !
0	in that case , you would better stop expecting , i muttered with an inexpressibly painful feeling
0	yes , they were coming from the garden , she was sure now
0	as always she simply appeared , as characters appear on the stage
0	in fact , she went to see vasin every day
0	now , let me say this : i ’ m not against christ , for he was an extremely humane character and if he were alive today , i ’ m certain he would join the revolutionary movement and might even play a leading role in it
0	but with me , ever since luga
0	it 's true you were quite rude just now , but
0	forgive me , sir , he cried , becoming agitated , as i was speeding here , i swore
0	what a bore you are !
0	and sometimes i used to take you to the forest , find a raspberry bush , sit you down next to it while i myself would get busy cutting whistles out of wood for you
0	why should i have come all this way otherwise ?
0	but balaam ’ s ass suddenly spoke up
0	a slight redness suffused his face and he stood up
0	it is true that when men understand that idea , the kingdom of god will no longer be a dream but a reality
0	katerina said reproachfully , bursting into tears
0	it is almost six months now since all that took place
0	do you have something special to say ?
0	then i picked up my little bundle and tiptoed down the creaking stairs , terrified at the thought that agafia should hear me from the kitchen
0	he looked extremely worried
0	he had completely forgotten about that door and it had never occurred to him that gregory could have seen it
0	let us first glance at the hapless , licentious , and depraved old man , that pater familias who ended his life so lamentably
0	where did you hear about it ?
0	i want to tell you with complete frankness how much i have appreciated your kindness and your delicate feelings that have prompted you to invite me to come and see you
0	forgive me , father superior—i may be a buffoon and act like one , but i have a courtly idea of honor and must be allowed to speak my mind
0	well , the peasant who had driven the geese into town was busy talking to someone and was paying no attention
0	you start then , mitya said , pulling his wad of bills out of his pocket
0	i already knew her face from the amazing portrait that hung in the prince 's study , a portrait i had been studying all that month
0	there 's a passage in the koran where allah bids the prophet look upon those troublesome creatures as upon mice , do them good and pass them by
0	i can see what a skillful investigator you are , mr nelyudov , mitya said with a relaxed laugh ; still , i think i ’ ll help you and make things even easier for you
0	mr karamazov asked , noticing the sneer and realizing at once that it was directed at gregory
0	what made you admit that to me ?
0	perhaps i have no love for you at all
0	but who died of consumption is she her stepdaughter ?
0	i denied it and called stepanov a liar to his face
0	in such cases , the main job of the investigators is not to give the suspect a chance to prepare himself , to try and catch him napping , to make him blurt out his most intimate thoughts , which will be revealing in their naivety , improbability , and inconsistency
0	oh , i readily concede that the accumulation of facts and the collection of coincidences is quite impressive , but i suggest you examine each fact separately , without being influenced by their combined implications
0	after this introduction , fetyukovich suddenly exclaimed :
0	the dark young man said almost nothing to anyone , but this did not prevent more and more people from gathering around him
0	that ’ s just the kind of unproud heart i have
0	trishatov came running in and the two of us tried to disarm him
0	although she would accepted his money , the gun was not part of their bargain
0	storms , because sensuality is a storm , even more than a storm
0	for the girl the lad flogs today he ’ ll marry tomorrow
0	well , never mind , kolya muttered in a whisper , apparently trying to cheer him up , but with no idea why he had uttered those words
0	of course , i have absolutely no right to reproach him for not visiting me more often because i know how busy he is now , vous comprenez , cette affaire et la mort terrible de votre papa , but then i suddenly found out that he had been received in my house after all , not by me but by lise—six days ago : he came , stayed with her for five minutes , then left
0	but i wish i knew what an honorable man does under these circumstances
0	that night in mokroye , he was unhappy and worried about the old servant gregory ; he was praying that the old man would regain his senses and live , that the blow he had struck him would not prove fatal , and that he—my client—would not be held responsible for that death
0	or perhaps five , if you wish
0	on another occasion we spoke about mother
0	when will you build your own edifice and organize your life justly by reason alone and without christ ?
0	i would tried to borrow money from him once before , of course , a couple of weeks earlier , and he would been quite willing to oblige me
0	and he told mitya not to tell you about his coming , in fact , not to tell anybody
0	that ’ s how i struck him down !
0	dana too had come several times but , in her case , i can not imagine what she could have been after
0	still , money was not the reason i was spending my time with sergei , although i needed money desperately
0	of course , i would been well prepared by the readings at andronikov 's house , but it was , above all , the way you recited it , yes , your acting , sir !
0	if she wants me , i will—right away
0	lise seemed dumbfounded and remained quiet for a whole minute
0	miusov , however , was convinced that it was all put on to impress the visitors
0	i must find out quickly , very quickly , because
0	i will find lessons for you here , he said
0	today , when you looked at your papa and at your big brother mitya , the idea of a crime occurred to you , didn ’ t it ?
0	at last it got quite dark
0	so you walked five weary miles , carrying the child , he said
0	as a result , the landlord now will do anything to please him , he literally slaves for the old man to get him to listen to his stories
0	i am telling you now that you do not deserve any mercy at all and this very day appropriate measures will be taken to render you harmless ; you will be taken out of town and placed in a suitable institution where they will bring you back to your senses
0	could i have possibly suspected you just because you went to mrs stolbeyev 's apartment to see that daria woman ?
0	anyway , i hugged my eccentric old friend hard and i felt happy
0	and she actually put the icon around his neck and even started to push it inside his shirt
0	obviously i had not expected to find them in a cheerful mood , but the oppressive atmosphere , which could be felt at once , and the despair i read in their eyes warned me that probably there was something besides sadness about makar
0	and that way you would settle your account with bjoring
0	snegirev again pointed in despair at the bare wooden walls in the passage
0	long before , he had said that he wanted the boy buried by the stone , but now everybody intervened—alyosha , kolya , the old landlady , nina , and all the boys
0	soon enough , however , he took hold of himself
0	i suddenly hated you at that moment and spouted all kinds of nonsense
0	he looks at me through the window , he believes me and he doesn ’ t believe me ; looks like he ’ s scared to open , even to me
0	if that ’ s the way it is , he interrupted smerdyakov , why would you want me to leave town and go to chermashnya ?
0	two inquisitive faces peered out from behind it
0	less than a hundred years after a man 's death , he may still be remembered by his children or perhaps his grandchildren who have seen his face , but after that time , even if his name is still remembered , it 's only indirectly , from other people 's words , and it 's just an idea about him , because all those who have seen him alive will by then be dead too
0	besides , a man is seldom willing to acknowledge another ’ s suffering , as if suffering placed one in a superior position
0	that same day i was to see efim zverev , with whom i would gone to high school and who was now studying at a technical college in petersburg
0	i will know in one second , whatever it may be !
0	it would be a public scandal , and public scandal was something perkhotin dreaded more than anything
0	i was haunted by my mother 's gentle eyes , which had been shyly watching me during the past month
0	i wanted to say more but could not go on because i was so moved it took my breath away ; everything looked so lovely and enchanting and i was filled with a joy such as i had never before experienced
0	why , you can check for yourself first thing tomorrow morning , as soon as young phoebus the sun arises
0	but now the unexpected karamazov parricide case brought him new hopes for his career : with a case like this , my name could become famous all over russia , he thought
0	if you come , make it seem as though you came on your own , just to find out how i feel
0	i am phaon , you are sappho ,
0	but the prosecutor would not admit anything ; he waited in silence
0	are you by the door ?
0	and so i started thinking of you , i can ’ t even tell you exactly when , i don ’ t remember
0	he was trying hard to make me understand something
0	i took off and was floating through the air again
0	and so your behavior is pretty low and disgusting
0	and here , you see
0	he was a young man of twenty or so , who was preparing to enter the university , but miusov , with whom , for some reason , he was living for the moment , was trying to persuade him to accompany him abroad , to attend the university in either zurich or jena and obtain his degree there
0	for the moment , i will only say of this landowner ( as they referred to him here , although he spent hardly any time on his land ) that he belonged to a peculiar though widespread human type , the sort of man who is not only wretched and depraved but also muddle-headed—muddle-headed in a way that allows him to pull off all sorts of shady little financial deals and not much else
0	i also remember how puzzled i felt and how i suddenly said :
0	but kolya was already standing by ilyusha ’ s bed
0	she nodded a mute yes
0	my dear boys , possibly you won ’ t even understand what i ’ m saying now , for i often speak very unclearly , but i think you ’ ll remember it , nevertheless , and some day you may agree with my words
0	yes , i thought of it during that terrible month : i was about to go and see katya , tell her about my betrayal and beg her for some money to take care of the expenses that betrayal would incur ( yes , i said beg , do you hear me ?
0	but i beg you never to mention me or what i ’ ve just told you to mr dmitry , because he ’ d kill me for much less , i ’ m sure
0	father paisii remained stubbornly silent
0	’ this is the amazing explanation he offers us !
0	i am sorry , my friends and brothers , that i can not express this more clearly
0	i leaped to my feet and hurriedly , breathlessly , told her about the night i would spent on his sofa , about our conspiracy before i fell asleep , although i would already confessed to her on the previous day that i would been plotting with him
0	if the accused rushed out of the house without killing his father , who did kill him ?
0	there are many—oh , so many ! —people without faith who just confuse the ignorant
0	that offended lisa and , if only for this reason , she continued seeing vasin
0	besides , he was so wound up that i had to be careful not to hurt him now : his agitation was so violent that , at certain points in his narrative , he suddenly stopped and remained silent for several minutes , pacing the room with a spiteful expression on his face
0	just try somehow not to gamble
0	i started building that pyramid under the blanket of my little boy 's bed before i fell asleep at night , during the moments when i was free to dream up things and cry
0	but he was asked so many questions in the direct examination that i can not remember them all
0	alyosha , my dear boy , you must go now , he said suddenly , in great haste
0	she gave it to me because that ’ s how much she loves those gold mines !
0	they are rich now
0	i will skip the formal questions and answers on the various points—they have slipped my memory
0	not that that restriction is to my advantage
0	it was absolutely indispensable for me to see him
0	this rich , greedy , and implacable widower , who still bullied his grown-up sons , had at first treated grushenka with a heavy hand and kept her on short rations , so the gossip had it
0	he would said he might be interested in renting and had inspected all the rooms
0	could it be , then , that i was an incurable gambler ?
0	they still had to bring that steam engine
0	one such monk , father job , a celebrated ascetic , famous for his feats of fasting and his long unbroken silences , whose memory was greatly cherished , had died at the beginning of the nineteenth century at the age of a hundred and five
0	that means there 's only my mother and my sister left and now i am almost on my own
0	no , i mean a clean sheet of paper , to write on
0	stebelkov says that he would consider my personal debt to him settled if i transferred to him my share of the inheritance , but he says that zhibelsky must also be compensated
0	such thoughtlessness , such a flagrant lack of faith , was felt to be pitiful , not to say ridiculous
0	i have already mentioned at the beginning of my story that , while gregory had hated fyodor karamazov ’ s first wife , dmitry ’ s mother , adelaida , he had sided with sofia , the crazy one , his master ’ s second wife , against the master himself or against anybody who said anything deprecating or slighting about her
0	what i regret most , vasin , he said slowly , apparently resuming a conversation they must have started before coming in , is that i did not manage to arrange it all yesterday evening
0	it ’ s so hot and crowded as it is
0	there still remain the questions why ?
0	driving here a few hours ago , he had been a completely disgraced man—he had committed a plain , outright theft and
0	but the person most impressed by it was the visiting monk from st sylvester of obdorsk , a small monastery in the far north
0	his chin was quivering
0	his voice was frantic , his hands were raised toward the sun , his face was pressed against the earth
0	by the time ivan reached his father ’ s house , he was really in the worst possible mood
0	obviously i will come tomorrow
0	that was yesterday
0	all right , now i understand everything !
0	grushenka asked , taken aback
0	as i read it , i almost shivered with emotion
0	everyone loved agafia , though , and they needed her because she was a marvelous dressmaker
0	they let him in , although as a rule they didn ’ t open for anyone at that hour of the night
0	how shall i put it—well , all in all , i ’ m unhappy about god
0	you have not dozens but hundreds of witnesses ; i ’ d say two hundred people heard me say that , perhaps even a thousand !
0	wouldo you realize , mother , he did not leave his address
0	snegirev screamed ; he must be buried by our big stone
0	of course , people are bound to resent it if you attack them without any provocation , mrs prutkov , i felt i had to put in , and , as a matter of fact , you chose to pounce on me just when i came in with a friendly 'good evening , which is something i have never done before
0	and that makes you laugh !
0	i walked over to the window and put my forehead against the ice-cold pane
0	but i demand that you answer this now : what did i do to instill such a horrible suspicion into your vile mind ?
0	i swear , all i wanted was the idea !
0	our time , he said slowly , is an age of the golden mean and in-sensitivity , of a cult of ignorance and idleness , of an inability to do anything , and of a longing for the ready-made
0	what did he mean when he said it ’ s always rewarding to talk to a clever man ?
0	it ’ s likely that they ’ ve gone to bed by now , sir
0	but i will come with you just to show you how little you scare me
0	and what about you , going to visit gentlemen after dark to try and peddle your charms for money ?
0	and she comes up with the most unexpected arguments
0	she got into her carriage and the footman started to stoop down and pick up her handbag
0	i did everything very deliberately and unhurriedly , for i realized how careful i had to be now
0	nelyudov went over everything , mitya willingly helping him
0	and that 's how that first awful day finished , one of the three fateful days with which this story ends
0	we just mentioned him here and now they are talking about him next door too , he said , and that 's one of those constantly recurring exceptions i mentioned
0	mr karamazov , sir , dear , don ’ t kill my mistress , please !
0	to start with , i could have him put under lock and key for what he did yesterday
0	when father zosima saw alyosha , who had stopped with an embarrassed look in the doorway , he smiled joyfully and stretched out his hand to him
0	all right , gentlemen , eloquence is a great thing , but i ask you now—should people really be encouraged to bash their fathers ’ heads in with blunt implements ?
0	then you ’ ll have to take your shirt off too
0	at times his voice would break off
0	i want to know : what did he come here for ?
0	at moments he felt he was suffocating
0	and now may i ask you this , if you don ’ t mind , fetyukovich said , unexpectedly changing his line of questioning , what were the ingredients in the preparation , or shall we call it the brew , with which , as appears from the preliminary investigation , your wife rubbed your back that evening , in an attempt to relieve your pain ?
0	by the way , everything you have here , we have too
0	it had all happened , the landlord specified , in
0	so stop annoying me
0	can ’ t you understand that , if i haven ’ t killed you yet , it ’ s only because i want you alive in court tomorrow
0	i interrupted him , and he looked at me as though trying to think of something
0	but toward this man , her first love , dmitry felt no jealous hatred whatsoever , nor even any hostility for that matter , as he streaked toward them in his troika
0	you know , i ’ d love to stay and have a long chat with you , my friend , but i ’ m afraid i haven ’ t got a minute to spare
0	alyosha took a three-kopek french roll and put it in the pocket of his cassock
0	i knew you would heard all those rumors
0	i jumped down , looked at him , and started wiping away the blood with a handkerchief
0	then , when i saw mitya , i told him laughingly that the pole had picked up his guitar and tried to sing me those old songs of his , hoping that i ’ d lose my head and go back to him
0	the little girl held in her hand a basket of the kind the peasants make
0	it ’ s all absolutely out of the question
0	i would be only too happy if it were so !
0	and now they ’ re traveling together
0	that ’ s your family ’ s problem : you are all sensualists , money-grubbers , and god ’ s fools
0	the servants left the room at once
0	because at the very moment when god damns me , at that exact , precise moment , it ’ s just the same as if i ’ d become a heathen and my baptism is taken away from me and no longer counts
0	she said , laughing and crying at the same time
0	after examining various opinions that had already been expressed on the subject , ivan presented his own views
0	if i had not been so furious yesterday , i think i would have laughed my head off : he turned pale , rushed up to me , bowed stiffly , and mumbled something in french
0	he screamed , beside himself
0	believe me , i particularly appreciate having you as my guest , zosima added , bowing to miusov and returning to his own seat on the sofa
0	and if i have to , i ’ ll give them money too , for some women take money and take it with passion too ; i admit that pleases them and makes them thankful
0	i ca not tell you more about this because it 's still a secret
0	but at least we ’ ll die in our own country
0	i am paying you back so i can ask you for satisfaction !
0	it was quite possible that he was a former army officer
0	finally ivan stirred , ready to get up
0	so , without intending it , we had some sort of an explanation
0	but everything was not taken care of yet : now on november we were having the third day of cold winter weather and all i had was an old raccoon-lined coat that used to belong to versilov and that would not fetch more than twenty-five rubles
0	if there were a shadow of a possibility that someone else—some sixth person—might have been there , i am sure that they would have suspected him instead , for even the accused realizes how utterly absurd it is to suspect smerdyakov of the murder
0	suddenly , it all struck me as very funny and i began to laugh
0	he was very handsome , too , and slender , above average height , with dark-brown hair , a regular although rather long face , and shiny dark-gray wide-set eyes , which gave him a thoughtful and serene look
0	she always thinks i don ’ t love her enough
0	but your ideal is rather vulgar , people might object scornfully ; all you are after is money and material goods
0	well , i suppose today 's younger generation is rather impatient while its understanding of life is still very vague , versilov said
0	where did you get all that ?
0	it 's all the work of that double of his !
0	it goes to show the subject is already familiar to you , that you ’ ve given it some thought—sensuality , that is
0	no , the shot doesn ’ t burn
0	as for vasin , i felt immensely relieved when he finally sat down at his table with his back turned to me and got down to work
0	practically the whole town besieged her and pleaded with her , but that only made her more disgusted : if it could bring my poor little babies back to life , i would have to accept him at once , but since it wo not , what would be the point ?
0	just think of the tales people tell about america , for instance—it 's really quite unbelievable —even from distinguished statesmen !
0	however , the old woman ’ s principal heir , the marshal of nobility of the province , efim petrovich polenov , turned out to be an extremely honorable man
0	some may say that alyosha was not too bright , rather uneducated , had not even finished school , and so on
0	my god , he ’ ll end up murdering somebody !
0	the presiding judge again warned him that he should just answer the questions and not indulge in frenzied and irrelevant exclamations , and then he ordered the proceedings resumed
0	listen to me : i thought today i ’ d have that bandit dmitry locked up , but i still haven ’ t decided what to do
0	i ’ ve already been there , seen him
0	kolya noticed that again he was becoming breathless with excitement
0	i wondered what all the tragedy could be about
0	one of the windows was open and fresh , cold air flowed into the cell
0	and i tell you , he has quite a few ideas in his head and he could have been— ah , hell !
0	the elder asked , looking at ivan
0	that ’ s a good sign
0	as i read it , i turned paler and paler , but when i would finished , the blood rushed to my face and my lips quivered with fury
0	what i mean , the elder went on , is that all this business of sentencing people to hard labor , with or without flogging , does not reform criminals and , more to the point , does not deter them from committing crimes
0	one way or the other , a lull followed
0	but what could he do about it ?
0	oui , she asked you to come here
0	but even then , to enjoy looking at someone is still not the same thing as loving him
0	for i do not believe you grieved much about the others ; in fact , you hardly ever gave them a thought , did you ?
0	n-no , not quite
0	i had not known of the existence of this portrait and i was struck by the extraordinary likeness , i mean spiritual likeness , that made it more like a painting than a mechanically produced print
0	later , however , your suffering will be alleviated and your life will turn into a sweet contemplation of the complete fulfillment of your firm and proud design
0	one of my sons—alexei—is seeking salvation here and , being his father , it is my duty to concern myself about his future
0	i have only one soul , i used to say to myself , and if i lose it , i will never find another
0	and that ’ s just what happened
0	so that ’ s what you want , my gentle boy !
0	i , for instance , demand annihilation for myself
0	i shall put it into words for the first time since its inception
0	i don ’ t feel like laughing now
0	i decided to kill some time there before going back to mrs prutkov 's , expecting that by that time she would have returned home
0	he ’ ll just put those arms around me and carry me off
0	so i ’ ll wait for you three or four or five or six hours or even seven hours , but i want you to know that today , even if it ’ s at midnight , you must go to katerina ’ s , with or without the money , and tell her that i send her my best regards
0	bless them , father , he said
0	yes , just friends , but i still think we should agree on one point : even if some day we should disapprove of each other , if we should become spiteful and nasty and horrid , even if we should forget everything else , let us always remember this day and this hour ; let us vow never to forget this day when we walked side by side , laughing and feeling so gay and happy
0	and when he had finished his complete account of the scene in which the hapless captain trampled the hundred-ruble bills underfoot , lise threw up her hands in despair and cried with unrestrained feeling :
0	for the hundredth time i repeat , there are many questions that could be asked , but i ask you only one—about the children—because i believe it conveys fully and clearly what i am trying to tell you
0	i was simply trying to express my opinion
0	but smurov , the southpaw , needed no instructions
0	look , i will loan you two thousand rubles without interest and wo not even ask you for an iou
0	but what would i want him dead for ?
0	and they ask and demand so boldly that the lord at once gives them the rank of angel
0	but , of the things the bulgarian told me , the following scene particularly caught my attention
0	whose finger did he bite ?
0	do you really think she deserves it ?
0	go to chermashnya for me and i ’ ll soon follow you there myself and bring you some presents
0	an intelligent man quipped recently that all our progressive movement has achieved in the past twenty years is to prove our crass ignorance
0	but if that ’ s where you want to go , it suits me fine
0	smurov suddenly asked heatedly
0	and although my present step was only a trial move , i felt that , to take it , i should first graduate from high school , break off relations with everyone , retire into my shell , and thus be completely independent
0	it was this confrontation between karamazov and his eldest son that led to the catastrophe which is the subject ( or at least the external plot ) of my first , preliminary novel
0	but even if the ladies of the entire world had joined their protest , even if they had been headed by the prosecutor ’ s own wife , even then they would have failed to stop him at that moment
0	when grushenka had asked maximov about his further plans , he had told her that he really had none for the moment and that , in fact , he had nowhere to go since mr kalganov , who has been putting me up until now , told me he couldn ’ t have me anymore and gave me five rubles
0	so do not disturb their joy , do not torment them , do not deprive them of their well-being , do not work against god ’ s intent
0	smerdyakov seemed extremely tired and said nothing for a whole minute
0	it was done in the most natural way
0	ah , come on , mitya , stop it , you crazy man , grushenka said reproachfully
0	it turned out the girls couldn ’ t love him either because :
0	the moment maxim had spoken , the newborn babe became sick
0	she hasn ’ t regained consciousness
0	it was time , though , to conclude the preliminary investigation with the interrogation of the witnesses
0	anna was only slightly pale
0	and thus making at least this small group of people happy
0	i ’ d love to see one !
0	what 's he doing here ?
0	it stands to reason that he hated the thought of where the money was to go , a sum that would have been enough to change his own future
0	i know it ’ s on the other side of the wood , mr karamazov told him
0	and to think that it was all the fault of the monster he was so desperately anxious to save !
0	i decided as i rushed home
0	that is precisely the crucial question , he said with irritation and got to his feet
0	i want you to admit
0	it 's true i would like to marry her , but i do not need any capital , i despise capital
0	why , you have turned pale , my friend !
0	the new prank was , however , of a very different nature ; it was quite innocent , indeed , foolish , and besides , as it turned out later , it was not even of kolya ’ s direct doing ; he was only involved in it
0	during that first visit , he even managed to offend ivan by telling him sharply that people who believe that everything is permitted were not really qualified to suspect and question him
0	you do not really believe that scum , do you ?
0	this is simply a solution of zinc , alexei
0	it was the first time we would been like that in our lives
0	but that is not what happened
0	give me your hand , grushenka—look at this tender , plump , charming hand , alexei !
0	that 's what i ask myself
0	i have thought about it a great deal and have come to this conclusion : why should it be so inconceivable for such a true and simple communion to exist some day among all russian people ?
0	a man , you know , may fall in love with physical beauty , with a woman ’ s body , maybe even with just a bit of that body
0	possibly i was the only one in that room to understand what vasin actually meant by ideas-turned-into-feelings
0	mummy never spanks us , nastya remarked
0	you know those gypsies—they ’ re all thievish and crooked , a lot of horse thieves
0	later , people assumed that he had gone to live there as maria kondratiev ’ s fiancé and that she had not charged him rent
0	i myself had told him various things on the subject on different occasions , except obviously for certain secret details
0	i do not know myself
0	her notion that it was somehow reasonable to marry the man vanished like a patch of fog scattered by the wind
0	you have to pound it all together , add some water so it forms a kind of a paste , and then pass it through a very fine strainer , like sheepskin—and there you have your powder !
0	it was at this point that the elder came back into the room
0	ivan leaped to his feet , swung his fist back , and hit smerdyakov
0	well , i do not remember exactly how he put it , but she trusted him once more , responding for the last time , so to speak , to his chivalrous promise by her heroic decision
0	and there are some nuts
0	and mitya says it ’ s impossible to live without happiness
0	that ’ s all , no more !
0	the pamphlet about richard was translated into russian by some high-society russian do-gooders of the lutheran persuasion , and it was distributed free as a newspaper supplement , for the enlightenment of the russian masses
0	nevertheless , he prescribed some mineral water that they have in the pharmacy here for my wife , and i ’ m sure it would do her good
0	it may last several hours , sometimes a whole day , or even longer
0	but you ’ re really wonderful !
0	where is juchka ? ilyusha asked in a breaking voice
0	later , however , the cheerful din of their voices and the stories they told began to distract her , and eventually she came to enjoy their presence so much that she would really have missed them had they suddenly stopped coming
0	was not i emphatic from the start in telling him that there was nothing between her and me and could not be ?
0	i understand that moscow high schools are very good
0	oh , i knew only too well that i always began to love your mother as soon as we parted and turned cold toward her the moment we were together again
0	the baron , on the other hand , kept raising his voice and was obviously a man who could lose his temper without much provocation
0	what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	i do not say that deprecatingly ; it is not a matter of egoism with them , nor a matter of having a thick hide and a lack of refinement : there is perhaps more goodness in such hearts than in certain heroes ; it is a reflex of self-preservation , acquired from the long experience of being downtrodden , that ends by dominating their behavior
0	mademoiselle , he may have told anna without beating about the bush , it is up to you whether to remain an old maid or to become a princess and a millionaire
0	smerdyakov removed the rag from his eyes
0	what does it really matter to me ?
0	this is an awful poem , he said , sounds as if it was written by a divinity student or someone like that
0	oh , i realize how stupid it was on my part to consider your money as my own
0	the prosecutor was very pleased with himself ; by taunting this nervous fellow with irrelevancies , he had succeeded in exasperating him , throwing him off balance , and now the man had said what he had wanted him to say
0	she ’ s very sentimental too , and that ’ s how i ’ ll get her , he said
0	among memories of my childhood , i must also include my memories of the story of jesus , about which i was very curious when i was still quite small
0	he took the song almost as a personal insult , announced that he was bored , sat down on the sofa , and dozed off
0	and that 's just what mr andrei versilov did at ems
0	she said it was anna who would sent her to tell me that she was at home , waiting for me , that i must come right away because otherwise it might be too late
0	her name was mrs tatyana prutkov and she was a landowner in her own right , owning , in the same district of tula province , a property with thirty-five serfs on it
0	'still , mother , i want you to wait before you start spending that money
0	my promise to give versilov one-third of the inheritance is eating me
0	would you like some tea , perhaps ?
0	but you yourself went around town telling everyone who would listen to you that you had gone through all of three thousand rubles that time , didn ’ t you ?
0	he always had , ever since the time i prostrated myself at his feet to thank him for that money , at the very beginning
0	i do not mean that literally of course , but when he was given pocket money ( for which he never asked ) , he either kept it for weeks on end without knowing what to do with it , or spent it at once on anything
0	because of his belief in these special talents of his , he felt that his remote superiors had failed to appreciate him fully , that his career had been hampered by secret enemies
0	but how did you manage to escape ?
0	he 's your father , is not he ?
0	and when i saw mother that evening , would i be able to say to her , as i had during these past days : i am on my own , free and independent
0	he said he had had a nosebleed , but they did not believe him
0	he first glanced absently at alyosha , but soon a frightened look appeared on his face
0	he stood there for a while , all alone in the darkness , and then clutched his head between his hands
0	he ’ s such a sweet boy !
0	before hanging himself , he left a note , which was rather strangely worded : i am putting an end to my life of my own free will and no one should be blamed for it
0	indeed , after that , everything was not only easy but even pleasant and exhilarating
0	they were all on the rhine , at some spa or other , all taking mineral water cures
0	it ’ s human blood , and , god knows , there was no reason for it to be shed !
0	so what did he ask you to tell me ?
0	i hope you ’ ll forgive me for saying this
0	when they meet they look at one another with deep , thoughtful understanding and in their eyes there is always love and sadness
0	so she said she ought to be flogged in public ?
0	and he sat there deep in quiet , sweet thoughts
0	my reasoning went like this : i have a hundred rubles and there are so many auction sales , junk shops , flea markets , and people requiring things in petersburg that if someone buys something it 's inconceivable that he wo not be able to sell it for a little more
0	he ’ s learning french words by heart
0	when do i receive the money , sir ?
0	the company that had issued the shares was raking in huge sums of money , but even so the offices could not handle the mad demand ; people of all ages and walks of life thronged the surrounding streets ; bourgeois , noblemen , their children , countesses , marquises , and prostitutes—all melted into a furious , crazy crowd , as if they would all been bitten by rabid dogs
0	but only for the reason i ’ ve told you , you must believe me !
0	that 's good , he said , articulating his words with deliberation
0	but at the time i was at home
0	i think you ought to go back to bed and get some more rest
0	you are afraid of them , are not you ?
0	it 's a long story
0	but what a pig that prince is !
0	i gather that by the time he was ten or so he had become aware that he and his brother were not being brought up in their own home but were , in fact , living on other people ’ s charity , and that there was something about their father that made the very mention of his name a cause for embarrassment
0	and then there was also that frenchwoman inquiring after you— mademoiselle alphonsine de verdun , she said her name was
0	jupiter possesses thunderbolts and is serene , for how often does he unleash his thunder ?
0	who , miss katerina verkhovtsev ?
0	we could assume anything rather than that
0	and why must you always play the fool ?
0	oh , but here is that corner
0	lidia akhmakov died a couple of weeks after her confinement but i do not know how
0	before we continue , i would like you to tell us , if you are willing to , whether it is correct that you disliked your late father and that you were constantly quarreling with him
0	you didn ’ t really believe he ’ d start performing miraculous tricks the moment he died , did you ?
0	suddenly she was overwhelmed by a longing for revenge
0	she seemed to have suddenly understood
0	i almost shouted at him
0	i know you have the reputation of being a witty man , but being witty is not the same as being intelligent
0	his eyes flashed , he laughed awkwardly , and his face turned deep red
0	i never saw him again after that day he spent in my apartment
0	just in case it should come up
0	knowing very little about medicine , i will only risk the assumption that perhaps he had succeeded in delaying the sickness by a desperate effort of will , although of course he could not avoid it altogether
0	i exclaimed in amazement
0	something had irritated him unexpectedly , something that he described laughingly as an amusing incongruity
0	has not she arrived yet ?
0	actually , mitya himself was none too sure what instructions he was supposed to give and why , actually , he had hurried out like that
0	and he would burst out laughing when there was absolutely no reason for it
0	he sat down on the bench and made alyosha sit next to him
0	from across the street i heard a scream , a drunken voice , and a streak of foul oaths
0	it may still be useful to you tomorrow , and you ’ ll be coming here again to ask me to lend you another ten rubles
0	and if you don ’ t go , he ’ ll be in a fever by tonight
0	the singers stood ready to burst into a dance song at the first signal
0	the singing and the deacon ’ s reading can be heard clearly from the church there , so it ’ s as if they were reading right over his grave
0	they say that man could not do without it on earth , for otherwise he would not be able to learn the difference between good and evil
0	you forgot to mention him , although it is on him that the edifice must be founded , it is to him that they will sing , you were right , o lord , for your ways have now been revealed to us !
0	she pleads , she refuses to give up
0	and even when he did , on occasion , talk to them , he was always brief , abrupt , and peculiar , and often rude
0	the room in question was in his private quarters and was just like any other room in the apartment of an official of his standing and i think it would be irrelevant for me to describe it
0	so you did want to kill him ?
0	and that object was found soon after they had heard gregory ’ s testimony
0	but it was anna herself who told me that rumor this morning , well before noon , which was certainly before you surprised her with it
0	and then the merchant turned us down flat : t do not know you , he said , 'and have no wish to know you
0	that was the only solution , but it was a solution
0	don ’ t look at me as if i ’ d said something idiotic
0	that won ’ t help her !
0	just think—that old man , hard as flint , and there he fell in the twinkling of an eye !
0	he was clean-shaven and wore his soberly brushed hair rather short
0	please do not pay uny attention to his ravings , katerina ; i told you he was described to us as deranged by the people he used to live with in moscow
0	i also remember very tall trees by the house , lime trees , i think , and blinding sunshine pouring in the windows , the little flower garden in front of the house , the narrow path
0	lately , it had happened that this boy , who before had always known where to stop , had begun to do things that really worried his mother
0	until the day before , alyosha had had no doubt whatever that katerina was deeply and passionately in love with dmitry
0	even two of the important old dignitaries shed a few tears
0	in fact , he was a rather arrogant fellow who seemed to despise everybody
0	a strange moment for a man to show such compassion , wasn ’ t it ?
0	as soon as lliey had sinned , tliey repented
0	for whatever you sow , you shall reap , or however the saying goes
0	after taking a few steps , he suddenly faced the setting sun , raised both arms , and , just as if someone had cut him down , hurled himself to the ground , yelling crazily :
0	i started dashing over to see the carpenter 's wife three times a day and , toward the end of the week , i managed to slip her an extra three rubles without her husband noticing it
0	although , come to think of it , what kind of prophesying is it to bang one ’ s head on the floor ?
0	indeed , the following day he reappeared on the promenade as if nothing had happened
0	the elder had told her sternly that she could not have prayers said for the soul of a living person , that it would be witchcraft , but he then had forgiven her because she didn ’ t know any better and added , as though reading out of the book of the future , as mrs khokhlakov put it in her letter , that her son vasya was indeed alive and that he would soon either come back to her or send her a letter , and that she should go home and wait
0	then i said gott der sohn , and he babbled in his tiny voice , gott der sohn , and laughed again
0	what precisely is an elder , then ?
0	when before daybreak the elder ’ s body had been made ready for burial , laid out in the coffin , and taken into what used to be his reception room , someone had wondered aloud whether the windows should not be opened
0	they reasoned with him for a long time and finally succeeded in calming him down
0	they all rose from their seats and rushed to him
0	now imagine this : that bandit had offered her fifteen rubles as an advance
0	there were lots of serfs on that tula estate and among them was a gardener by the name of makar dolgoruky
0	mitya asked , staring at him
0	they both shrieked , for how could they not shriek under the circumstances ?
0	he was rather pale at that moment , but his eyes were glowing and intense
0	( the baron looked me over with scorn )
0	but just two days ago , he wore a quite unaccountable fixed stare when we were talking
0	it has nothing to do with kindness , he said
0	i told him that i was going to my old man samsonov ’ s house for the whole evening and would stay there very late counting money
0	he talked a lot like that and the bits i have mentioned are just odd samples to give a general idea of the sort of thing he said
0	the jurors retired and the court was adjourned
0	she sat down in the armchair where she had sat earlier
0	only i am not sure whether that 's what i was really thinking
0	i cried out , turning deep red and holding onto his hand , which i had seized and forgotten to let go
0	are you waiting for me , by any chance ?
0	but please , holy father , you mustn ’ t think for one moment that i ’ m implying anything—i was just wondering
0	mrs snegirev shuddered but at once recovered and giggled happily
0	she wasn ’ t bad-looking either , to the russian taste : tall , strong , with a full figure and beautiful eyes , although her face was somewhat coarse
0	he sort of demanded it of everybody
0	and don ’ t bring it up again
0	how could i help it when you hadn ’ t put the bandages back in the proper place ?
0	it was the women who eyed the champagne the most eagerly ; the men really preferred brandy , rum , and particularly hot punch
0	well , don ’ t believe it , the gentleman said with an affable smile
0	in fact , i want to thank you with tears in my eyes and tell you how deeply i respect you for the way you behaved on that occasion
0	when i stepped out into the street and took in a chestful of cool fresh air , i shuddered all over with animal delight , i would even describe it as carnivorous
0	if she could do it , the thought somehow flashed through his head , why can ’ t i ?
0	he will be preaching about god just as he did before and
0	and although miusov ’ s story may have been exaggerated , there was certainly an element of truth in it
0	he felt a sharp stab in his heart
0	but i feel you have to be a piece of slime to say that
0	the landlady , a very old woman , lived there with two nieces , themselves already elderly spinsters
0	i suppose i did it for no special reason , just for the hell of it
0	i believe i have the whole picture now , ivan went on , thanks to those instructions shouted to you , together with some other indications
0	you have no right to insult me , mrs prutkov , and you would better stop !
0	and you like people to honor and respect you , because you ’ re very proud
0	mitya was surprised in his turn and told the priest that that was how samsonov had referred to the man
0	these have chosen by their own free will to suffer
0	answer that question for me , alyosha , and whatever you say , so it will be
0	could this be your 'idea ' by any chance ?
0	even in you , philosopher that you are , it must be possible to discover it , too , if one catches you unawares
0	and you are right , my dear boy , gambling is a stupid and piggish occupation
0	but his features were drawn and his complexion unhealthily yellow
0	wait , see that traveling bag ?
0	but then he passes one house after another , his cart moves on and on
0	carries you off to heaven alive ?
0	but an end to this fearful isolation is bound to come and all men will understand how unnatural it was for them to have isolated themselves from one another
0	i have been wondering what made you decide to leave that money for me yesterday
0	all right , good-by then , alyosha !
0	there were cards on the table and they seemed to have been dealt out for a game of fools
0	perhaps there 's really no point going into all this , but the few days that followed , during which nothing special actually happened but which have remained in my memory as a pleasant and serene period , should be mentioned because such periods are rare in my past
0	i enjoyed the flight , i loved it
0	what have i done to deserve to be waited on ?
0	well , as i said , that was precisely the weak point of my idea : it allowed all sorts of detours
0	the ladies were less pleased with the prosecutor ’ s summation , but even they were duly impressed by his eloquence , especially since they were not in the least worried about the outcome and had complete confidence in defense counsel fetyukovich , who was to speak at last and would , they felt , crush all opposition
0	the visitor i just had was mr versilov
0	you know that , if ivan hasn ’ t recovered by that time , she will take care of everything herself
0	everyone in the courtroom cried out with joy , they were so pleased with the verdict
0	we must start right away with the interrogation of the witnesses
0	now , if i hadn ’ t stolen her money , you still could have told her : but whatever else he is , he is not a thief , so here is your three thousand rubles—he sends it back to you
0	ah , it 's quite a long way , i see
0	besides the fact that this money would be honestly acquired from a highly respected and saintly sister , i would be able to get medical treatment for my wife and nina—you know , my hunchback daughter
0	oh , there was much that i forgave her when i gradually grasped the situation
0	you see , that samsonov to whose house i went
0	mother , you ’ re spoiling him , ruining him , lise ’ s thin little voice came from behind the door
0	let me tell you this : it was i who caught you , not you me , just now !
0	but i have been waiting and worrying the whole week
0	he also confirmed reluctantly , and only after insistent questioning , that , after the poles had been turned out , mitya ’ s standing with grushenka had improved dramatically and she herself had let him understand that she loved him
0	and , indeed , mrs khokhlakov ’ s carriage had driven up to the gate
0	it ’ s an inner conviction , the feeling i have about the man
0	she ’ s the sister of that general ’ s widow from moscow and she used to be even more high-and-mighty than her sister until her husband got caught misappropriating government monies and lost everything he had
0	i ’ ll sign anything
0	at one point the clerk , who had followed them behind the curtain too , and who was fussing around his superiors , suddenly called nelyudov ’ s attention to mitya ’ s cap , which was also being felt and fingered
0	you must forgive the bad pun , since you ’ ll have to forgive me many other things much worse than that today
0	tell me that first , for if you don ’ t , you have no right to accuse him !
0	nevertheless i described with tremendous heat whatever i knew on the subject
0	well , capable of killing that old fool fool—do you ?
0	that bow , however , had made a staggering impression upon alyosha , who was absolutely convinced that it had some mysterious meaning
0	no one saw her
0	i say that it was neither trifon nor sabaneyev , but chizhov , said a third woman , who until then had been listening intently in silence
0	i noticed , though , at various dances—we had a lot of dancing parties—that her eyes would flash a look of helpless anger at me
0	in fact , just the opposite , i feel children should show respect for their parents
0	he obviously felt that a man visiting the monastery with such laudable intentions would be received and treated with much greater consideration than an ordinary visitor who had come out of mere curiosity
0	thomas believed , not because he saw that christ had risen , but because he had the will to believe beforehand
0	no , no , mitya , who still couldn ’ t understand , insisted
0	as to how to deal with me , for that too he had two alternative plans of action
0	he said that by the stone
0	to sin with a pretty , playful serf girl ( my mother was not playful ) was not only natural but well-nigh inevitable for a depraved young dog ( and every landowner was depraved , whether liberal or reactionary ) , particularly in versilov 's case with the idle life he led and the romantic figure he cut as a young widower and all that
0	he knows what it is
0	i just said that to impress him
0	where were you going , alyosha ?
0	and he may have had a point , because i looked out of place there , like some sort of savage , sometimes even attracting people 's attention
0	when we got to a wood lambert , reckoning that after having been caged for some time a bird would not be able to fly very far , let the canary out and started shooting at it
0	they say that paper can not blush , but that isn ’ t true
0	what ’ s in this crate ?
0	mitya seemed to remember something
0	kolya rushed out into the street
0	no , i didn ’ t really mean that
0	no , you don ’ t really want it
0	i do not want your love , because i do not love you myself
0	mademoiselle alphonsine , the pretty boy said , moving toward her and showing her the tie
0	this time they seized me and held onto me
0	you are surely not speaking of yourself , are you ?
0	you have given me a new lease on life
0	his hair was awfully black ; his complexion was fair ; his cheeks were red as though they had been painted on a mask ; his nose was long with a hump in it , the kind many frenchmen have ; his teeth were very white and his eyes black
0	besides the heavy , fleshy bags under his eternally insolent , suspicious , mocking little eyes , besides the multitude of tiny wrinkles on his small flabby face , his large , meaty adam ’ s apple hung under his sharp chin shaped like a purse , and this somehow gave him a repulsively sensual air
0	there ’ s a fellow called foma who lives in this house with those sluts
0	it ’ s all my fault , mitya started , having again misunderstood grushenka ’ s rebuke
0	i know you are very hurt , lisa said , blushing deeply
0	may the almighty forgive that correspondent for those fading charms , as i forgive him , for let me tell you , i know who that correspondent is !
0	i ’ m not even sure whether i had any affection for you then
0	you understand , he is asking this of us , of us who have come to ask him that very question !
0	and there was not the slightest resemblance between the two of us—in fact , we were just about opposites
0	i can still hold up my head before you
0	and it was in that state that alyosha found him
0	so you must have heard it from him , right ?
0	she ’ s not likely to marry a fellow who doesn ’ t have a thing to his name , like mr dmitry
0	we understand this comedy
0	not even a tiny little bit ?
0	as a result , i stopped talking to him seriously myself , and soon i almost stopped talking to him altogether
0	i do not remember what brought about that memorable conversation , during which he occasionally sounded rather irritated , something very unusual for him
0	they explained to him that this particular epileptic seizure was an exceptionally violent one ; that , for several days afterward , it had kept recurring ; that , indeed , the patient ’ s life had been in considerable danger at first ; and that only now , after intense medical care , could it be said that the danger had passed and the patient would live , although , dr herzenstube added , it was possible that he would suffer from a mental disorder that might last for a very long time , perhaps all his life
0	of course i ’ m not going to tell on you , but , for the time being at least , i will have nothing to do with you
0	besides , he must have heard by now about versilov 's gesture
0	do not hate those who reject you , those who dishonor you , those who abuse you and slander you
0	he stopped short when he saw me and his face twitched
0	we do want him , we do !
0	he repeated suddenly , and this time loud enough for everybody in the room to hear
0	nor would i have to run after women—they would come running after me , anxious to give me everything a woman can give
0	mitya started to plead with the priest to accompany him and help him get hold of the hound—you ’ ll save my life if you will , father—and , after some hesitation , the priest finally agreed to go with mitya to sukhoi , probably because he was curious about the whole business
0	don ’ t you think i am living in heaven now ?
0	when she spoke , i understood from her very first word
0	when katerina sees lambert , she bursts out laughing
0	i shouted , glaring at him
0	suddenly , glancing at his face , i recognized in his expression the same fixed , desperately intent , and perfectly sober eyes riveted on me as that morning when i would almost frozen to death
0	he did all that in great secrecy
0	you ’ ve heard , haven ’ t you , that the elder zosima died ?
0	in that case he would have been the victim of temporary insanity ; he would have simply been subject to a natural law , irresistibly and unconsciously , like everything in nature
0	thus , lisa , who in our presence was so proud of her hero , treated him quite differently when the two of them were alone : i am convinced of this from certain indications
0	i think if she heard us laughing together a couple of times , her gentle and simple heart would fill with joy
0	we would walk around looking for a respectable woman , follow her waiting for an opportunity when no one was close to her , and then , without saying a word , come up , one on each side of her , and , pretending not to notice her presence , we would start having the most obscene conversation across her
0	no innocent should be made to suffer for another man ’ s sins , especially innocents such as these !
0	all of a sudden ?
0	i will tell you , i will tell you a frightful secret , mrs prutkov , but not just now , because there 's no time now
0	the old servant brought him the samovar , and ivan poured himself tea , but he did not touch it and sent the old woman away for the night
0	rest assured , my boy , that i am sincerely delighted
0	and if there 's mystery in the world , it only makes it even better ; it fills the heart with awe and wonder , and it gladdens the heart : 'all is in you , oh lord , and so am i , and so keep me
0	then he suddenly calmed down
0	why , did you serve in the cavalry then , since it was the russian cavalry that you were talking about ?
0	can ’ t make you out !
0	then the blood rushed to his cheeks
0	c ’ est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors
0	i suddenly knew that , try as hard as i might , i would never succeed in making a clean break from that whirlpool , notwithstanding my obstinate silence and my refusal to ask daria to elaborate on the wonderful things she would told me
0	but i can ’ t , father : you know it ’ s about fifty miles from here to the railroad station and the moscow train leaves at seven pm i can barely make it as is
0	nevertheless , i definitely disliked him now
0	tell me , though , are you really so concerned about mother ?
0	yet i have declared a thousand times that i had no intention whatsoever of writing about myself and i was determined not to do so when i started out on these memoirs because i realized only too well that there was no reason why the reader should be at all interested in me
0	mitya let out a yell and ran into the forester ’ s room across the passage
0	will you at least tell me that finally ?
0	and here ’ s julia bringing us the ice !
0	so go and fear no more
0	alyosha did not finish school
0	these were the very words of the old lecher , who knew he was dying and who , indeed , did die within five months
0	so let us part good friends and you will remain the most precious and the most meaningful memory in my whole life
0	and it was at thatl moment that i noticed sergei and darzan : they stood behind me
0	believe me , i have often been very bored in the company of society people , especially since my return from abroad and all the troubles that have beset my family
0	i ’ ve met him , but i want to hear your opinion
0	and i saw the other one changing a card , kalganov said
0	and he suddenly produced his wad of bills
0	he took alyosha to a far corner of our cemetery where he pointed out a cheap but decently kept grave with an iron headstone bearing the name of the deceased , the dates of her birth and death , and even an ancient four-line verse such as is often found on the tombs of lower middle-class folk
0	he asks me , for i understand you ’ re supporting him now !
0	he would given her a down payment of twenty rubles , and the following day , after he would stolen the letter from me , he would had a second meeting with maria , promising her another two hundred rubles for her further services
0	much has changed since then
0	and i think and think
0	that kind of thing , vasin said in conclusion
0	she found them living in dire poverty , almost indigent , without food , heat , or tobacco , and owing money to their landlady
0	mitya exclaimed , as if some brilliant idea had just occurred to him
0	and these were the questions that had tormented me back in moscow , to which i would hoped to find the answers when i joined him in petersburg
0	the two merchants looked respectable enough , but they seemed strangely quiet and slow-moving
0	however , everybody knows how a child burns up clothes and now they had to run around barefoot with just their shirts on their backs
0	then he went and fetched all the evidence he had to prove his crime
0	but , in the first place , it is possible to love children , at close quarters , even if they are dirty , even if they have ugly faces , although to me a child ’ s face is never really ugly
0	i want him to sit here , with us , she said imperiously , addressing no one in particular , although she looked at the man on the sofa
0	it ’ s because she ’ s so afraid of it that she ’ s sure he ’ ll recover
0	i know i ’ m vile , but still i like being what i am
0	he said he couldn ’ t diagnose it yet , that we would just have to wait and see
0	cost me what it may ,
0	besides , women are never too good at evaluating correctly a man 's intelligence : if they like him , they are only too eager to accept even his paradoxes for well-reasoned conclusions as long as they coincide with their own wishes
0	but how could i not have been offended by the way that woman had treated me ?
0	after the death of his wife , he went to his country estate where he had that affair with my mother
0	but now i think i have run too far ahead
0	is there a hope left that i have not ?
0	what if rakitin is really right and god is just a fiction created by men ?
0	you frightened me with that sock of yours , he said , grinning strangely
0	that 's no literary notion , he said , although i suppose you may be right
0	somehow that seemed to anger him and he flung his hat into the snow muttering , i don ’ t want the hat , i don ’ t want it
0	he ’ ll see you a little later , when he gets back
0	he ’ s sent a story about her to a newspaper
0	ah , yes , he would take her away at once , if not to the edge of the world , then at least as far as possible , to the edge of russia , where he would marry her and live with her , knowing no one , here or there , or anywhere
0	well , for your information , my boy , what she was trying to do was to eat you up !
0	and mrs akhmakov is going out again a great deal , one ball after another ; she is having a great success and they say everybody , even the people at the imperial court , is crazy about her
0	the following morning he had nothing but contempt for smerdyakov and his sneers , and a few days later it struck him as rather surprising that he should have been so painfully hurt by smerdyakov ’ s suspicions
0	i was worried about that too , but
0	for instance , under direct examination , the testimony of the innkeeper at mokroye , trifon , created an impression extremely unfavorable to mitya
0	don ’ t you know that this is the greatest of his days ?
0	he had that wound
0	and imagine , as i was leaving , who should arrive but sergei
0	well , why not , you are not even twenty after all , so it is quite excusable
0	did he do it alone or was the accused his accomplice ?
0	but then , days pass and my client ’ s father does not pay him the three thousand rubles
0	they are proud and brave in exposing themselves to danger , but worried and full of concern for their companions , because everyone is anxious for the life and happiness of everyone else
0	it was about four and getting dark when i returned to mrs prutkov 's
0	right , he let it out for a walk—that ’ s just what i was trying to say
0	ou est lambert , as-tu vu lambert ?
0	but you know she ’ s not here
0	indeed , two or three days before , he would even inadvertently allowed himself to mumble something indicating very indirectly and in a roundabout way that he was afraid for me or , to be more accurate , afraid of the dressing down his daughter would probably give him because of me
0	the terrified fenya was only too glad to get off so easily , but she realized that he did not have time to argue with her then and that otherwise she might have paid dearly for her lies
0	tell me what happened that night
0	then we drove out of the city gates to do some shooting , and on our way we met a bird catcher with bird cages
0	do you remember the first question ?
0	only when he came to the door to see his son off did the old man become a little agitated and even make a gesture to embrace him
0	he felt very weak and ill he started to doze off but then nervously got up and walked up and down the room to shake off his drowsiness
0	i felt it degrading to explain to this woman the new goals i would set for myself
0	of course i do and , what 's more , i am just the same
0	and the battle of stones was resumed , this time very viciously
0	if , instead of all your abstract philosophizing , you talked to me like a human being ; if , for instance , you would said something to me about my idiotic gambling , i would not have allowed myself to sink into it like that , i suddenly reproached him
0	and it so happened that a week after that he had his first fit of the falling sickness , an ailment that was to afflict him for the rest of his life
0	when the wise and dreaded spirit placed you on the pinnacle of the temple and said , if you would know whether you are the son of god then cast yourself down , for it is written : the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself ; and you shall know then whether you are the son of god and shall prove how great is your faith in your father , you heard him out , then rejected his advice , withstood the temptation , and did not plunge from the pinnacle
0	he muttered with the grin of a maniac
0	he ’ ll come here because he ’ ll be raving mad or because he ’ ll be afraid that i ’ ve failed to let him know because of my illness , or he may just lose patience , become suspicious , and want to search the house , as he did yesterday when you were here yourself , to make sure that she hasn ’ t slipped in unnoticed somehow
0	he seemed to have completely forgotten that a few moments earlier he had terrified , insulted , and hurt her
0	and is not it to keep my eye on her that you want me to continue going to the prince 's ?
0	she said , now with unmistakable impatience , dismissing the matter with a wave of her hand
0	but , come to think of it , anna said again , not so very long ago your feelings toward katerina were not so nice at all
0	besides his tender fervor , i also liked in him certain extremely original views on various problems still controversial in our age
0	right , nuts , that ’ s what i wanted to say , the doctor said imperturbably , as though he had never forgotten the word but been interrupted
0	then why do you stand being pushed around and why are you afraid to hurt them ?
0	and i don ’ t feel at all ashamed when i tell them to you
0	you won ’ t be afraid to stay alone and you won ’ t start crying , will you ?
0	i cried , reeling under the impact
0	i took it out and examined it with a certain curiosity
0	probably he managed to throw it away somewhere under the table
0	why don ’ t i have any respect for you , alyosha ?
0	a month later , however , i was staring at my revolver and thinking of death
0	he also knew that some monks were quite outraged by the custom in the hermitage of first bringing all letters received , even those from relatives , to the elder , who unsealed and read them before handing them over to the recipient
0	he told me that , as things stand now , he ’ s dishonored and he doesn ’ t care about anything anymore , alyosha said , speaking with great heat , with the hope pouring back into him that perhaps there really was a way out , that his brother could still be saved
0	i am not sure whether the presiding judge somehow separated the witnesses for the prosecution from those for the defense ( i expect he did ) , or in what order they were supposed to be called
0	i wo not attempt to analyze here what prompted versilov to make such a deal with an individual like lambert except to remind the reader of that double of his
0	he leapt to his feet , and , with a wild responsive howl , not knowing what he was doing , rushed to meet her
0	where does she live ?
0	the way he would asked her that might have warned her to give up the whole thing , but she was such a headstrong , impatient girl and she would not take such insolent questioning
0	at first , she listened to me with that usual composed , patient smile of hers , but little by little surprise and even fear appeared in her intent look
0	was it anna who told you that ?
0	but the clouds will pass and the music will play for us again
0	the words escaped him involuntarily
0	i ’ ll ask her if i see her
0	it must be noted , incidentally , that considerable changes had taken place in alyosha since we met him last
0	i was just trying to make a pun , i said , trying to cheer up the company a little
0	actually i was nervously waiting for matvei
0	on the way , maria kondratiev suddenly remembered that some time between eight and nine in the evening she had heard a terrible , piercing cry from the garden
0	oh , i know i have behaved cruelly and dishonorably toward her
0	but mother quickly covered her face with her hands and rushed out of the room
0	and , indeed , when kolya once asked the teacher who was the founder of troy , dardanelov replied in general terms about the migration of peoples , about the difficulty of discerning facts in such ancient times , about the creation of legends , without giving kolya a precise answer , ie , without naming the person or group of persons who had founded troy
0	i suspected what kind of place it was , but i did not imagine it would be so much like a kennel
0	it was a tiny room containing only the most indispensable furniture
0	we ’ re late and it ’ s against their regulations
0	and the owner of the geese keeps hollering , they could have killed lots of geese that way !
0	it may come in useful sometime in your wanderings
0	i can just imagine how furious i would have been had i been in sergei 's shoes !
0	that really incensed him , and he had the affrontery to tell katerina that , after what had happened , he was no longer surprised at all the fantastic rumors that were circulating about her
0	the two poles suddenly stood up
0	but this time sergei shuddered so violently when he saw him that i noticed it from where i sat
0	listen , you irresponsible old woman , kolya said , getting up , i want you to swear to me on everything that is sacred to you in this world , plus something else to make it a bit stronger , that you ’ ll keep an eye on these children here while i ’ m away
0	you are a much better person than i am , incomparably better , and i am awfully fond of you
0	do you really mean it or are you just pretending ?
0	to put it as concisely as possible , i had decided to give serious thought to lambert as soon as i was able to think straight
0	that is all very nice
0	they were larger and more comfortable than the elder ’ s , but their furnishings were not very lavish either : the chairs were mahogany covered with leather in the old style of the ’ s and the floors were not even stained , but everything was spotlessly clean and there were beautiful flowers in the windows
0	as to wrublewski , he turned out to be a dentist in private practice
0	but i bet he did not make it—it was you who said that to him !
0	i felt sad but laughed as convincingly as i could
0	alyosha felt that his father was a bit like a certain tradesman in the town
0	what did he want ?
0	i feel sorry for her , but a feeling of disgust rises up inside me
0	the greatest idea there is ?
0	and , you know , i still feel depressed about it
0	there is one detail that engraved itself so strongly on my memory that i must mention it : mother was sitting on the sofa and close by , to her left , stood a little round table on which an icon lay , apparently put there for some special purpose
0	and he can see ilyusha ’ s dying
0	my dear boy , i am only too pleased to hear that you
0	how does your daughter feel ?
0	however , during all that time , she never completely lost contact with makar
0	i promised to come back and see him the next evening , so that we could talk everything over , since there was so much we had to discuss
0	but i am sure , gentlemen of the jury , that you can remember for yourselves the sad scene that followed
0	i can not stand it any longer !
0	he made a second appearance in town , this time to force on his father a final settlement of their accounts
0	yesterday you gave her fifty rubles for your board , but she says it could not possibly have come to more than thirty
0	anything could happen , but when he first arrived in lambert 's company he had no idea of what it was going to be
0	i even heard from unimpeachable sources that several serious family quarrels had broken out on mitya ’ s account
0	and my anger was growing too
0	both the side pockets of his overcoat were bulging with stones
0	the authorities have given us official permission and indeed , they are rather encouraging the marriage
0	about three weeks ago he came here and started teasing me
0	and i ’ ll tell you also , mother dear—we are all guilty toward others and i am the guiltiest of all
0	it 's too easy to make mistakes , to exaggerate , to miss things
0	in despair , poor strangers wept ,
0	we have heard the prosecutor admit that , up to the very last moment , until this very day in fact , he hesitated about whether he should charge my client with cold-blooded , premeditated murder
0	he watched helplessly as they dragged her away , crying and stretching out her hands to him
0	they drove up in two carriages
0	i do not need one ruble more than i have
0	i was sold to him and i ’ m tied to him , since we were married by the devil , and there has never been any other man
0	alyosha was looking at her , trying hard to understand her
0	what right did you have to allow this slut into my room !
0	then , of course , i could not talk in mother 's presence about his meeting katerina and all the rest up to the most important point , that is , the letter he would just received from her and his moral regeneration that followed
0	he was born of a hen
0	alyosha began to weep
0	i know the gate was locked more than an hour ago , he said , looking intently at alyosha
0	glory to the highest in me ,
0	alyosha was in a great hurry
0	you may have really decided to put that bullet into your brain
0	the poles were already seated
0	my whole article is based on the idea that , during its first three centuries , christianity existed on earth as a church
0	i know i promised to stick to facts , but what about the reader ?
0	you were warned , he says to him
0	i ’ m addressing the question to all of you , reverend fathers !
0	dergachev occupied the whole cottage in the yard of a wooden house belonging to a merchant 's wife ; the cottage had three rooms and in all of them the blinds were drawn
0	it was a delusion , he said , but may that delusion be blessed !
0	i even kept crossing myself as i walked
0	and maxim built the promised church in our town and also a hospital and an almshouse
0	although father paisii heard alyosha come in , he did not even look in his direction
0	and later he could go to some other town and become a justice of the peace or something of that sort , for i am convinced that people who have suffered themselves are the best qualified to judge others
0	lisa too thinks he 's wonderful
0	all right , i ’ m going
0	and whose intelligence and character she had always considered superior had reappeared on the scene
0	now , losing patience , mitya pulled the man violently by the arms and legs , lifted his head , picked him up , sat him on the bench , and finally , after long and stubborn efforts , succeeded in getting the drunken man to produce an inarticulate bovine lowing , which was followed by slurred cursing
0	besides , as we all know , a bundle of bills in someone else ’ s hand always seems bigger than it really is !
0	he 's missed you so much
0	why is it annoying ?
0	indeed , if a lady with a romantic imagination came across my notes , she would make a sour face from disappointment
0	i can safely say that lambert may have had good reason to prepare an alternative plan to betray her , and it was perhaps really her fault
0	well , all that 's none of my concern , i said impatiently , all i want to know is whether mr versilov is still at home so i can find him there
0	whatever we may say , maxim said to her , he was no babe when he killed himself
0	i would look after those sufferers
0	mitya asked at first , but a second later he shouted in a strangely loud voice , as though he had been turned into someone else : i under-stand !
0	it was an extremely bright day
0	she beseeches you to accept it—both you and she have been harmed by the same man ; indeed , she thought of you only after she had been insulted just as badly—i mean hurt as deeply—as you were
0	the floor was rotting , the floorboards loose , and the woodwork musty
0	it was not really makar 's death , not just that
0	but he didn ’ t stab me again
0	it is good that you should think of these things rather than others
0	and he does not love you
0	many years later i learned that versilov was abroad at the time , that she had decided to come to moscow and had used her meager savings to pay for the journey , i believe secretly from the people with whom she was staying in versilov 's absence—all that just in order to see me
0	mother muttered something disconnectedly and thanked him and , when madame touchard came in too , mother started begging them not to abandon this poor orphan because he is just like an orphan really , so please be good to him
0	and so it was
0	oh , do not bother about it , ma'am , just add it to our accounts
0	that woman who ’ s driven so many to their ruin !
0	it was just a windfall for you and me that he invented that story , because that is what will pin mr dmitry down for good
0	but then you must tell me the truth , everything , and what you meant by that noose
0	stebelkov , who had been on his feet since the noise began and had been blissfully eavesdropping , unabashedly burst out of the room into the passage
0	so now i ’ m trying to put as much aside as i can , and just for my personal , private use , my dear son alexei karamazov—i want everyone to know that
0	seen from the outside , of course , not from my own viewpoint
0	and i remember answering them : well , why not ?
0	the woman burst into tears of sheer joy
0	kalganov was aware of mitya ’ s relations with grushenka ; he probably also had a good idea of what the pole meant to her , but he was not much concerned with all that
0	i would been to mrs prutkov 's only once before
0	since , they said , it is just as impossible to escape sin and the devil in the church as in the outside world , there was no point in coddling sinners
0	he looked wildly around him
0	but suddenly he burst in on her
0	why should not women work ?
0	i know you think it works miracles , but you watch : i ’ m about to spit on it and you ’ ll see that nothing will happen to me
0	he repeated for the third time in an imploring voice
0	but alyosha had nothing new to tell the monks for they already knew all about it : when rakitin had sent the monk to call alyosha , he had also asked him to most respectfully request his reverence father paisii to receive him , because he had a message of such great urgency to deliver that he didn ’ t dare to delay one minute
0	let me tell you this : my little brother sasha , who was still a small boy , died four days ago
0	and she herself closed the heavy curtains
0	i ’ ll see to it that he comes to see you , the elder said
0	sofia , here 's some money
0	the prosecutor asked him at one point , adding : you needn ’ t answer this question if you don ’ t wish to
0	but why did you have to start as stupidly as you could , as you put it ?
0	i will give you just one week , no more
0	and you , rakitin , shut up , because you ’ re lying
0	it creates , in fact , a most interesting problem : once , for instance , i heard a member of the government say that his best ideas came to him when he was asleep
0	and even when he came out of his thoughts and addressed his visitor , it was always suddenly , unexpectedly , and he always sounded as though he had said something other than what he had intended to say
0	well , when he ’ d read it , he laughed and started to criticize the poem
0	you might at least look at me now !
0	snegirev put in ingratiatingly
0	in most cases , people , even the most vicious , are much more naive and simple-minded than we assume them to be
0	you may not believe it , but i ’ ve had a feeling for a long time that you ’ d come up with something like this in the end
0	but you said so yourself
0	mother soon came to her senses , sank down onto the sofa , covered her face with her hands , and burst into tears
0	i could cause a commotion here too !
0	dmitry ’ s whole personality and even his appearance made ivan cringe
0	she broke away from him , pulled aside the curtain dividing the blue room , and dashed out
0	at the table in the doorway sat a man who , judging by his badge , must have been a court official , and he conducted the auction
0	and i really mean this although , as you well know , i do not belong to the gentry myself
0	but mrs prutkov was frowning
0	in any case , let me hug you !
0	at that moment , i heard a carriage rumble by me and then stop by the gate of a house
0	what he wanted to do was to come out , face the people of the town , and announce publicly that he was a murderer
0	every day , every hour , i went about with the fifteen hundred rubles dangling from my chest
0	but even then i already knew that all the problems facing me did not really matter , that the only thing i was interested in was katerina , that outside of her there was nothing
0	that ’ s how he lives
0	she screamed at me
0	also , his hair was cut much shorter
0	now tell me , who is most to blame for their failure to understand ?
0	how can he , when he obviously prefers her to the woman he ’ s promised to marry ?
0	go on , please—tell me
0	and so he was baptized then and there , and princess dashkov acted as his godmother and potemkin as his godfather
0	i only know that there had already been three elders , zosima being the third
0	but whatever the reasons , once i had that document in my possession , i felt in such a strong position that i was only too tempted to rush off to petersburg
0	unfortunately , though , such words and such talk are inevitable at school
0	that 's what he was like at the time , and obviously these ways made everyone respect him , although i have heard it said that he was quite unbearable
0	that was the moment when rakitin caught sight of him and pointed him out to alyosha
0	they remained silent for a moment , alyosha looking quite alarmed
0	you , he says to me , you think i killed him , and he says that to me , of all people
0	he did not know that the younger lady had advertised herself in the newspaper as a teacher
0	mitya had opened the pistol case , untied the powder horn , carefully poured out some powder , rammed the charge into the pistol , picked up a bullet , and , before inserting it , was holding it between his thumb and finger , examining it in the light of the candle
0	and did you believe him when he told you that ?
0	the table had been moved next to the sofa so that the room looked very cluttered now
0	somehow or other , he had made friends with your father ’ s lackey smerdyakov ( your father was still alive at the time ) , who taught the little boy a stupid trick—i mean the filthy and beastly trick of kneading a piece of soft bread into a ball , sticking a pin into it , tossing it to a hungry dog , and watching what happens
0	oh , i know very well that the best thing i can do when there are people around is to keep my mouth shut
0	as to the imminent return of the officer , the man who had played such a fateful role in grushenka ’ s life , dmitry somehow did not even give it much thought during those days
0	or perhaps you simply heard him tell it to others ?
0	i thought it was not quite as respectful as it should have been
0	but peter , who is not one to be easily intimidated as you know , suddenly assumed a pose of outraged dignity , gave mr rakitin such a sarcastic look , and started to apologize : oh , i had no idea you had written it !
0	when he had met her before , this woman had always left him with the uneasy impression that she held a threat ; and the last time he had been terribly shaken by her malicious , wicked behavior toward katerina
0	perhaps that ray will do
0	perhaps it ’ s a secret , though ?
0	listen , arkady , i have known all along that you had no idea of what was going on and yet you persist in offending papa and thereby offending mother as well
0	gentlemen , he said in a loud voice , almost shouting , please don ’ t mind me
0	i agree , my boy , that if i am right , the whole business looks rather silly , but i ca not help it if it does
0	yes , arkady , he really is not well , i did not just invent that for convenience
0	porfiry answered quickly that he had done as he had been told and had handed the widow the money from an anonymous well-wisher
0	this time he was completely dumbfounded
0	did you put it just like that ?
0	and did you see devils there , among them ?
0	do you think it is really right to confess publicly ?
0	but i don ’ t care if i did
0	so alyosha said to himself : i can not very well just give up a couple of rubles , instead of all that i have , or , instead of obeying the lord ’ s follow me , just attend church
0	the assumption was , of course , that all this was an act of freely and sincerely accepted obedience and voluntary submission to salutary guidance
0	but on this occasion , makar turned the conversation in a strange and unexpected direction
0	they lived in a small room , but it was clean and sunny
0	from the beginning , all of us , especially mother , surrounded lisa with loving sympathy
0	but , we ’ ll talk about that some other time , too
0	alyosha was visibly shaken
0	i ’ m so sorry i can ’ t go and see him
0	they were reintroduced in russia toward the end of the eighteenth century by the great ascetic ( as he was called ) paisii velichkovsky and his followers , but to this day , almost a hundred years later , elders are found in only a very few monasteries and they have occasionally been subjected to persecution as an un-russian innovation
0	the finnish woman was either cuttingly rude or , after mrs prutkov had finally exploded , silent for weeks on end , thus punishing her mistress for stepping out of line
0	it is a fact though , he said , starting to laugh again , that the inquisitor is ninety years old , so he has had plenty of time to have been driven completely out of his mind by his idée fixe
0	will that put your minds at rest ?
0	and all this time the devil 's song continues and pierces her soul deeper and deeper like a spear—the notes get higher and higher and then , suddenly , it all breaks off in a shriek : 'accursed one , this is the end !
0	tell me at once , where is she now and with whom is she , in mokroye ?
0	his knife was in his pocket and somehow the palm of his right hand was smeared with blood
0	at this late hour ?
0	i made up my mind at once
0	yes , she 's been quite a character ever since she was a little girl , our miss tatyana , makar said with a smile
0	and this meeting took place precisely wherever it was the boy lived as a child
0	the caucasus would be good for your daughter
0	and you must add this to that prayer : i do not pray for them out of pride , o lord , for i myself am the most loathsome creature of all ’
0	tell me , have you met mrs khokhlakov ?
0	i ’ m longing to have a drink , especially to have a drink with you
0	i ’ ve really got myself quite a reputation around here !
0	the clerk kept repeating idiotically ; i know you , i know you !
0	people are living in russia now as if in a hotel : they plan to leave at any moment , they only hope that it will last as long as they are around
0	ah , and they will take the bed away !
0	you don ’ t usually seem all that afraid of him
0	so she said that she can be hard and cruel herself—ah , i love cruel , strong women of that sort , although i can not stand it when someone is jealous of me , i just can ’ t stand it !
0	it was obvious that she no longer cared what consequences her testimony might have for herself , although she must have visualized them earlier , for during the previous month she had often asked herself whether she should not , after all , reveal the letter at the trial , and she had shuddered with rage as she imagined the scene
0	you see , gentlemen , i am well aware of the difference that exists between us
0	well , then , the old man adds with a grin , so now you have seen free men
0	that was the only reason
0	the old prince nikolai sokolsky was sitting on the sofa near a little round table while , at another table covered with a cloth , anna was making tea , pouring the boiling water out of the landlady 's glittering samovar , which i would never seen so beautifully polished before
0	perhaps , after his long absence , he was anxious to see his father ; perhaps , before he came , he recalled his childhood many , many times , seeing it like a distant dream , dismissing the ugly ghosts of his early years and longing to rehabilitate his father ’ s image in his own eyes and to embrace the old man
0	the cook opened the door and informed me with her usual ill-mannered apathy that her mistress was out
0	i would anticipated his objections and explained to him that what i had in mind was not as stupid as might appear
0	even five minutes before the end , as they later reported with wonderment , none of them suspected anything
0	he had also helped himself to two cups of chocolate
0	then she pours some of the stuff into a glass and makes him drink it , and says a certain prayer
0	then we spat at each other 's feet and parted , never to meet again
0	i am doing my verv best to write about other people and if , nevertheless , i keep popping up again and again , it 's just a regrettable necessity , which , try hard as i may , i find quite impossible to avoid
0	and what about the money ?
0	cleverer than you , boy
0	later , there was no one to oppress me and , if anything , it was i who treated other boys with contempt
0	yes , and i think you ’ re right , ivan said in a quiet but firm voice
0	i draw my lips close to her insolent bright red lips , which are quivering with laughter and inviting me
0	that ’ s the question , for i can not live without her
0	she said , turning suddenly to the smaller of the two
0	relax , sir , there 's really nothing for you to worry about
0	i clenched my fist and shook it at stebelkov
0	how is it possible that you know me ?
0	today she actually demanded to be allowed to get up , to stand on her feet , and she did stand up for a whole minute without any help
0	but what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	i am sure you were just as lovely as she is now
0	and you know , i also used to know an old man once
0	self-sufficiency is the most important : even now i have a violent dislike for contact or association with people
0	and so mitya sat staring wildly at the people around him without taking in what they were saying
0	i want it all to myself—it can not be ilyusha ’ s !
0	and although , mind you , he never once used the rod on the child—he was afraid after what had happened—he could frighten the wits out of him all the same , even without a rod
0	do you follow me ?
0	and if i became so excited and irritated , it was because i detected behind certain words the implied existence of secrets and intrigues which reminded me of the past and with which i was fed up to the teeth
0	the most important thing now is to convince him that he ’ s on an equal footing with us even though he has accepted money from us , alyosha went on hopefully
0	later you ’ ll be glad you did
0	i ’ m afraid i ’ ll hate the sight of him too much at that moment
0	his language was perhaps more colloquial than the prosecutor ’ s , but it was also more precise , and he avoided long and involved sentences
0	but i must run off and write that letter , she concluded abruptly , even starting to walk toward the door
0	i want you to keep quiet , alyosha , because you ’ ve made me feel ashamed with what you said about me
0	he had brought me here to clear up some misunderstandings , to justify himself , to find out something , but now everything had been cleared up and justified without any need for words
0	there was a silence , a silence that lasted for a whole minute
0	what was your purpose ?
0	when i stepped out into the street , i somehow felt full of energy : something new and important was building up inside me
0	mr karamazov left the window
0	but all this is hindsight on my part , for at the time i did not detect at once the change that had taken place in him : i still had the sensation of floating through the air and there was still that same music playing in my heart
0	but i don ’ t know , sir , i don ’ t know , mr karamazov
0	but a couple of weeks after his first visit to smerdyakov , strange thoughts started to torment him again
0	mrs kondratiev , a well-to-do merchant ’ s widow , took lizaveta to her house early in april and tried to keep her there at least until the baby was born
0	before i bring a new character—versilov , that is—onto the scene in my chronicle , i must give some brief background information on him , even if it really does not mean much
0	alyosha , i love grusha terribly , mitya said suddenly in a quivering voice
0	and he swung around in his chair so violently that it cracked
0	so you ’ ll go to grushenka !
0	is it a novel ?
0	how can you talk like that !
0	you have not the slightest idea of what i can show you !
0	mrs prutkov also came to see me , almost daily in fact , and , although she did not treat me with anything resembling tenderness , at least she did not berate me as she had before
0	ilyusha held his hand and was calling for his father
0	as he was reaching for it , his sleeve caught in a china lamp that fell to the floor smashing into a thousand pieces so that the whole house resounded
0	i will describe it without comment
0	i have been preaching to you for a great many years , my dear fathers and brethren , and , of course , all the time i have been doing the talking
0	i knew and found it amusing , so i helped those miserable thieves and crooks to perpetrate their forgery and i did it for money !
0	i weep even now , german , even now , you dear old man !
0	but madame touchard will be offended and the boys will laugh at me
0	i had prepared a plan of action for the day
0	you can bet what you like that they ’ ll go right to those eternal verities , such as the existence of god and the immortality of the soul
0	next to this desk was an equally wretched-looking armchair , with a spring sticking up in one corner that got in versilov 's way when he sat down and made him swear
0	so if the administration of justice were in the hands of society as represented by the church , it would know whom it should absolve from excommunication and receive again as its son
0	but ten days later , little arina fell ill i got a doctor to examine her
0	but the hell with them
0	let me apologize once more for reporting all my drunken thoughts in such detail
0	if you believe that , you must be either blissfully happy or desperately unhappy
0	when you were about to come here last spring , you thought to yourself : there are new people there who plan to destroy everything and start once again with cannibalism
0	he frowned and said : fyodor karamazov , our dear papa , was a pig , but he reasoned correctly
0	it occurred to him now that ivan might very well be there , especially on the eve of the fateful day
0	i have said so before
0	the thing is , i was morbidly sensitive to false notes
0	see , i was not lying !
0	and katerina , whom she has also offended , must forgive her too
0	and i ’ m supposed to bear it for twenty years !
0	i met mr vasin last year in luga , lisa answered with complete simplicity as she sat down and looked at me gently
0	and here ’ s a letter for you , ma ’ am !
0	oh , i think , if only i were here alone !
0	he could not bear to hear dirty words or a certain type of talk about women
0	but then it was as though someone whispered into my ear : you can be sure , if you go to ask for her hand tomorrow , that with a character like hers she ’ ll refuse to receive you and order her flunkey to throw you out of the house , as if challenging you to go ahead and cry it from the roof-tops , to show you that she isn ’ t afraid of you
0	he could not face the bonds of marriage and withdrew from the world to seek silent and solitary retreats where he felt sheltered from worldly vanities
0	no , they could not
0	the door on the left led to another room of exactly the same size that was shared by my mother and sister
0	i do not stand to inherit from anyone , so i ca not tell you what i would do
0	he had never been so insulting with me before
0	as for the disgrace , what difference does it make ?
0	he was suspected of irregularities—in brief , his enemies were preparing a nice surprise for him
0	let ’ s all drink , all of us !
0	when alyosha first heard of the planned gathering , he was very perturbed
0	the present generation of progressives is incomparably more down to earth when it comes to their own interests
0	her complexion was very fair and her cheeks delicately rosy
0	whenever the boy would take his nose out of his books for a second , he would be sure to hear maxim shouting : hey , boy , read your book !
0	and i do respect you precisely for having , in this era of rot and decay , got hold of some 'idea ' of your own—i certainly remember that you have your 'idea , you can be sure of that
0	some of these i still remember
0	all that my puny , euclidean , earthling ’ s mind can grasp is that there is such a thing as suffering , that no one can be blamed for it , that quite uncomplicatedly cause precedes effect , that everything that flows finds its proper level—but then all that is just euclidean gibberish , and , being aware of that fact , i can not agree to live by it !
0	the doctor said , stamping his foot and becoming really angry
0	why are you grinning like that ?
0	it is true that all the mud slinging started only much later , for , at first , everyone was immensely impressed by her revelations
0	i don ’ t even know yet all the things i ’ ll tell them
0	there ’ s nothing for me but a stinking alley and that she-cat !
0	but he came back to me ; and for two weeks after that , he kept coming back every evening , still preparing himself , still unable to make himself go through with it
0	she was waiting for lambert anxiously and was surprised that he , who had been turning around her until recently , had suddenly vanished into thin air
0	such an individual acts like a really guilty man just out of fear , or because he has been intimidated
0	kolya snapped at the boy , who turned beet-red but did not dare to answer
0	when she would lined them all up by the church door , the children still had some sort of shoes on their feet and jackets that still looked like jackets , for they were not peasants after all but the children of a merchant
0	i often acted like a terrible heel at that time , and i was well aware of it myself
0	and then , to the remaining questions , one after another , the answer was always the same—guilty , guilty , guilty—and always without extenuating circumstances , without recommendation for leniency
0	well , in the sixth week of lent , my brother became seriously ill his health had always been very poor ; he was weak in the chest , had a frail constitution , and was predisposed to consumption
0	and it 's possible that there was a profound meaning in what he said , which , however , you simply did not understand and
0	leave him alone , the hell with him , i whispered to versilov
0	let me look at you
0	that question is my answer
0	he cried , as if he had suddenly come out of his daze
0	we may see greater things , see greater things yet !
0	remember , though , there were only a few thousand of them and even these were gods rather than men
0	so i look at him and see that he has one of those stupid round mugs—he must be about twenty or so
0	i heard that in his last month he became much more sensible , even somewhat reserved ; he stopped being frightened of everything and bursting into tears and , in all that time , never once mentioned anna
0	now that was something nobody could really understand
0	i ’ m terribly afraid of him !
0	just as in the first days of creation when the creator , at the end of each day , paused to admire his work with the words , that which i have created is good ! —so in this story he looks at job and again praises his creation
0	i came here to make you my wife , but i find here not the woman i know before , but a different woman , a woman who behaves bad and has lost all shame
0	wait , do not say anything yet
0	that is why i am sending you
0	versilov turned to mrs prutkov
0	but would you be so kind as to explain to us what really prompted you to jump back into the garden ?
0	ah , the way she jumped to her feet and threw herself at him !
0	and i can still see him now , sitting in that armchair , gentle , smiling , and always looking cheerful despite his illness
0	i sat there with them and wondered to myself why i didn ’ t even know how to talk to him now
0	grusha , my life , my flesh and blood , my only joy !
0	she said in deep reproach
0	if you undressed him you ’ d find a yard-long , smooth brown tail , like a great dane ’ s
0	it was a million zloty bank
0	her dialogue with god is absolutely fascinating
0	wait , that door
0	and if this phrase has reached you now , perhaps there 's something i ought to congratulate you on ?
0	i love you as much as alyosha , you know
0	well , it 's great that you are up now
0	this time , however , the dog ’ s patience was tested for only a few seconds :
0	smerdyakov , who had gone to fetch something or other in the cellar , slipped on the first step and fell all the way down the stairs
0	well , i believe it would be worth our while to discuss that envelope for a few minutes
0	but then karamazov tries to blame a man who was lying in bed at the time , knowing full well that he may anger him and make him immediately tell the truth , if only to protect himself—make him reveal that both of them were in on it , but that he himself was not the killer and had simply been too frightened to prevent the other from killing
0	while you would be sitting there , fancying we were in awe of you
0	don ’ t laugh , rakitin , don ’ t talk about the elder—he was better than any man on earth !
0	and he slapped me affectionately on the shoulder
0	why , then , at five pm of that same day , by your own admission , you
0	cried the pastors and the philanthropic ladies
0	if i would told you before , we would have quarreled and you would not have let me come see you in the evenings
0	in the first place , the prosecutor began , what is the origin of this suspicion ?
0	perhaps nothing will come of it , and it will just peter out by itself
0	for half an hour i waited in the street in front of that house
0	the only trouble was that she was unhappy ; she was too willing to sacrifice everything for an unworthy and irresponsible person
0	dmitry karamazov told me that , and you must believe him
0	he came in moaning and crying , and now he ’ s ill
0	what is it i am supposed to know ?
0	each time i come here , you stare at me with great curiosity and i can almost hear you thinking : he still hasn ’ t done it !
0	certainly , argues the prosecution , but this man , who had been shouting in every tavern that he wanted to kill his father , two days before the murder , when he wrote that letter , behaved in an unusually quiet manner and picked only one quarrel with some shop-assistant , because , we are told , karamazov could not help picking a quarrel with someone
0	not so my commanding officer , an old lieutenant colonel
0	you don ’ t believe one word of what i ’ ve told you
0	and i also wanted to say this to you too : if you decide to do a good thing , do it not out of envy but for god
0	mitya seemed extremely puzzled all of a sudden
0	smerdyakov murmured now in a faltering voice , smiling abjectly , prepared to draw back at any second before ivan ’ s anger
0	he was soon demoted to the ranks for fighting a duel , only to be restored to his rank again for gallantry
0	i can ’ t see it at all
0	alyosha heard the shrill laughter he knew so well while he was still in the hall , and realized from the sound of it that his father was still in the blissful state preceding drunkenness , but not yet drunk
0	that 's impossible , she graduated with a silver medal !
0	please do , by all means , write down that i won ’ t answer it
0	according to my idea , you can find something devilishly interesting in every woman , something you won ’ t find in any other
0	yes , he does say bad things about you , but then he says bad things about everybody
0	no , nothing terrible will happen
0	without being sufficiently educated , sergei sokolsky pounces upon various ideas and tries to cope with all sorts of situations that are beyond his capacities
0	he has disgraced the uniform , some said , so let him hand in his resignation
0	and then something happened that was to change the course of my life
0	but alyosha did not have a chance to pursue his thoughts
0	more than that—perhaps this memory will protect him from succumbing to the temptation to commit a mortal sin and he will think better of it , saying to himself : yes , there was a moment when i was good and kind and brave !
0	mitya gaped at him , completely dumbfounded
0	oh , like him , we are such a spontaneous , sincere people ; we are such an amazing mixture of good and evil ; we love enlightenment and schiller , but we also love to rage and storm in taverns and to tear out the beards of our drunken drinking companions
0	here we are sitting all alone , without anyone to hear us , so why must you insist on continuing with this comedy ?
0	i was also thinking of my sister
0	in that case , he would have confessed , because he would have had to
0	besides , he is the murderer ; i may have just said it was gregory , but it ’ s really dmitry and it ’ s much better that way !
0	there was only one man who was close to her—the bedridden old merchant , but then he was much more of a father , a guardian , to her than anything else
0	the first thing he would done that morning was to move mother and lisa ( who , i learned later , had been ill since she would returned home and had to stay in bed ) into my former coffin-like attic , while the rest of the place , especially the living room , had been cleaned and tidied up with special care
0	my dear friend , this is getting so interesting that i suggest
0	after all , she too possessed that typical russian breadth !
0	did you come all the way from the petersburg side ?
0	glory to the highest in the world !
0	i am not a man of letters and have no wish to be one ; i would consider it indecent and despicable to drag my soul onto the literary market and turn it inside out while describing my feelings in beautiful words
0	and , to be sure , he carried it all out , exactly as planned and described in this letter !
0	true , he never asks me for money , but it would be all the same if he did
0	a confession is a confession—a holy sacrament—i revere it and prostrate myself before it
0	what was important is that i had finally gained insight into the man , although , paradoxically , i felt almost disappointed that it all turned out to be simple
0	who counted the money ?
0	' a ladies ' prophet , ha !
0	killing you , did you say ?
0	they ’ re crazy , both of them , rakitin hissed , staring at alyosha and grushenka in amazement
0	and since you know now , i said , almost choking with emotion , tell me this : is it because you suspected i knew the whereabouts of that letter that you have been so nice and friendly with me and lavished on me your irresistible charm ?
0	and what do we find in reality ?
0	don ’ t you remember the fellow who killed that merchant olsufiev ?
0	i want you to explain to me why these burnt-out mothers are standing here , why there have to be poor people , why the poor babe must suffer , why the steppe is barren , why people don ’ t embrace and kiss one another , why they don ’ t sing joyful songs , why they look blackened from that black misfortune , why there is nothing to feed the babe
0	in this , lambert was basing his hopes mainly on bjoring
0	alphonsine exclaimed , et les amis ?
0	we ’ ll be ending soon , don ’ t worry
0	were not you there too ?
0	only i insist that it not be here , but behind that curtain
0	i assure you it 's true
0	kolya suddenly burst into delighted laughter
0	no , not him , i did not mean sergei
0	for you ’ re dealing with a suspect who is perfectly willing to give you evidence that will incriminate him !
0	i , too , have a very important matter to discuss with you , only i don ’ t know how to begin , alyosha said
0	but what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	ah , what is he reading ?
0	nevertheless , it made a great impression
0	yes , out of great joy !
0	have you been admitted to communion ?
0	what would be the point of lying to ourselves when that ’ s just how things are in life and , i suppose , it ’ s the only possible way they can be
0	i remember now that i promised you much more , infinitely more , than three thousand , but i was thinking of the mines when i said that
0	and what is america ?
0	the gun went off and the bullet hit the ceiling without harming anyone
0	so the devils got hold of her and tossed her into the flaming lake
0	i started to walk again and resumed my train of thought : there is a serious objection
0	rakitin turned into a back alley and walked away
0	to think things over more comfortably , i lay down on vasin 's bed
0	you don ’ t really expect me to give you the whole three thousand right away , do you ?
0	his brow was knit in concentration
0	besides , i admit i ’ ve had quite a bit to drink
0	yes , he had , but he still could not get rid of the past—it was still there , tormenting him ; apparently he could not atone for the past just like that
0	i felt it was unfair , i even detected something sarcastic in it
0	well , now you ’ ve seen , now you ’ ve heard for yourself !
0	somehow i could not make myself look into her face
0	she just arrived a short while ago and now she ’ s sitting in there with them
0	sometimes i think i ’ m just another despicable bernard !
0	i ’ m so sorry i played that silly trick on you
0	i know that for sure
0	and where is it now ?
0	you may be lucky now , though
0	if he went there by bolshaya street and then crossed the square , it would be quite a distance
0	there followed a long silence , which only increased the irritation her intrusion had already provoked in me
0	and he 's a man of great understanding
0	this exile was a quite well-known scholar and he had once taught philosophy at the university
0	this is my young friend arkady vers——here he goes again—arkady dolgoruky
0	speak up—i want you to explain what is really in your mind
0	why don ’ t you wait a short moment , mr gregory , and hear what i have to say , because i haven ’ t finished yet
0	you know , alyosha dear , until now i had very little respect for you , i mean , i respected you only on an equal footing , but from now on i ’ ll respect you on a superior footing
0	but best of all , keep your mouth shut
0	then something strange happened
0	we had a lady like that in moscow , just as virtuous , who also would turn up her nose just like this one
0	besides , even now your manners are not all that perfect either , for why did you have to avoid looking at anyone and stare into a corner when you came in ?
0	the truth is , though , that nature took its due !
0	but it was not anything you said or have done that made me blush—it was the fact that i ’ m just the same as you are
0	miusov was ready to shout at him but then , containing himself , he said scornfully : you defile everything you touch
0	please don ’ t be angry with me , she said
0	i promised him i would pray , feeling this would please him
0	although i suppose that after all
0	well , personally , i ca not complain : a new life has started for me
0	he was out of breath
0	and as i was lying here on my sofa , just as i am now , alexei , i suddenly thought to myself : shouldn ’ t i ask mikhail rakitin to leave my house immediately , because he is being insulting , shouting like this at my guest ?
0	and when you came that time , when i called out to you to come in and asked ivan to come back with you , he gave me a look so full of scorn and hatred that i was seized by a terrible fury and shouted that it was he , he alone , who had convinced me that dmitry was the murderer
0	sometimes i was very touched by the way he came in the evenings , looking rather sheepishly at me at first , as though asking you are sure i am not disturbing you ?
0	when i die , get another boy , a good one
0	i was simply talking about varnish , those superficial things , you know , those stupid but socially indispensable graces
0	that was because they analyzed only the parts and failed to study the whole , showing thereby a truly astonishing blindness
0	but you do have a chair , i see
0	my mother was not at the landlady 's ; she had left and had taken the mother of the girl with her
0	and that was why he welcomed him so enthusiastically now , feeling that , just from the way he had pulled up to the entrance of the inn , dmitry would be a good person to fleece again
0	sing , you little bird of god !
0	stebelkov said slowly , staring at me fixedly with an unbelieving grin
0	it ’ s just that i left someone behind in a pretty bad state
0	i shall act , now , the way he wants me to act
0	ivan was still gaping at smerdyakov in silence as if his tongue had become paralyzed
0	as far as i know , maximov has never even been to poland , so how can he speak about it ?
0	you ’ ll earn yourself a fifty-ruble tip if we get there no more than an hour behind them
0	the elder zosima entered accompanied by a novice and by alyosha
0	is not it just a dream ?
0	why , does he sound angry with me ?
0	he disliked the elder at first glance
0	but i was wrong—he ’ s still a human being for me
0	wait a bit , i don ’ t think i ’ m lost yet
0	it may seem rather surprising that , if he was so convinced of this , he had not gone to her in the first place and thus remained , so to speak , within his own social circle , instead of going to a man from a different background , such as samsonov , to whom he did not even know how to talk
0	for she knows very well that you have no father and that anyone who feels like it can push you around
0	as i lay with my face turned toward the wall , i suddenly saw in the corner the bright patch of glowing sunlight that i had been anticipating with such disgust
0	please can i have your hedgehog ?
0	her aunt , mrs fanariotov , who had been outraged over anna 's scandalous engagement to the old prince , now , after anna 's refusal to accept the money , radically changed her opinion of her niece and solemnly assured her of her respect
0	on the previous morning , alyosha had not been able to find him anywhere and he had never turned up to meet ivan at the inn
0	no , i haven ’ t read it , but i ’ m planning to
0	trishatov cried , leaping up
0	he was indeed a man of character and great conceit , for , after all that had happened , he still hoped grushenka would choose him , so highly did he value himself
0	but you know that all men must be brothers
0	there was practically no furniture , just two benches along the walls and two chairs by the unpainted wooden table that had on it , however , a white tablecloth with a pink design
0	all right , i will give you four , he said , catching up with me when i was already in the yard
0	now here ’ s another , even more favorable one
0	shall i tell them , mitya , my boy ?
0	little arina had not really cost me very much
0	then he had paid him another visit two weeks later
0	you know , i ’ m awfully pleased that you ’ ve come , terribly pleased !
0	ivan asked with a laugh
0	and you , gregory , don ’ t whimper
0	look at me , look hard : you see , here , here , something terribly dishonorable is being concocted !
0	he gulped down one glass of tea and poured himself another
0	and the point is that you still have not answered our earlier question , namely , why did you divide the money in half , then proceed to squander one half and put the other half aside ?
0	why , didn ’ t you know that i turned him out of my house ?
0	well , that ’ s a matter of personal preference
0	something extremely unpleasant and bothersome , he answered almost angrily
0	i say that anyone who 's honest is entitled to judge
0	i ’ m speaking of the ways of women
0	zershikov was a retired army captain and the tone of his establishment was quite tolerable—militarily curt , businesslike , with a fastidious observance of formalities
0	of course , he could have put an end to the scene if he had wished , but he himself seemed to be waiting for something , watching attentively , as though he were trying to make up his mind about something that was still unclear to him
0	he was good to me and took me in when my own family had kicked me out of the house and i was running about barefoot
0	but who are all the people ?
0	versilov came up behind me
0	a huge elm rustled faintly overhead
0	but now it turned out that there was a man living in their former room and that it was not versilov
0	stunned and filled with despair , the monk went to constantinople , where he begged the ecumenical patriarch to release him from his vow of obedience ; but the patriarch explained that neither he nor any power on earth could ever release him from his vow of obedience , and that only the elder who had imposed the command had the power to rescind it
0	somebody 's calling you , zershikov said , pulling at my sleeve
0	now for number two : why must we part with bitter thoughts of revenge , gnashing our teeth , abusing each other , etc ?
0	i went to see him and spoke to him , but the impression he made on me was altogether different
0	do you think it ’ s ridiculous ?
0	but a highly educated man striving for a lofty ideal may sometimes completely lose sight of what is around him and become ridiculous , whimsical , and callous—not only in his practical life , but ultimately even in his own theories
0	a good half of my generous disposition left me immediately
0	do you think i wanted to conceal it from you ?
0	all landladies have a favorite lodger whom they treat with special consideration : they clean his room with greater care , sweep his floor more thoroughly , hang lithographs over his sofa , and lay a mangy-looking rug under his table
0	that stench sometimes made versilov swear aloud and curse his existence , and on that point i fully sympathized with him because i too hate bad smells , even though they could not get all the way to my attic under the eaves , which i reached by very steep and shaky steps
0	the lights , the chandeliers , the elegant ladies , the dashing officers , the important government officials , the pretty young girls , the rows of chairs , the curtain
0	a feeling of happiness such as i would never known before penetrated my heart so violently that it even hurt—it was the sensation of universal love encompassing all mankind
0	why am i done for ?
0	or he may concede the fact and explain it away as a natural phenomenon until then unknown
0	i want to see her right now , i must give her my blessing !
0	is it possible that the opportunity will be wasted and nothing will come of it , just because i have no money ?
0	just before i went to grushenka ’ s that first time , when i intended to beat her up , katerina had sent for me to ask me to go to another town and mail three thousand rubles to her sister agafia in moscow for her , because , for some reason or other , she didn ’ t want people here to learn about it
0	millions of articles have been written about it
0	we ’ ll have fish soup—a special , fresh one , not today ’ s heated up
0	this time , however , i found it quite unbearable and told him i had a headache
0	i could not understand why
0	but if that ’ s the way you feel , the hell with you , he cried , tossing andrei five rubles
0	her tone was harsh when she said that
0	something seemed to be in the air
0	for some reason or other , however , the girl had become particularly attached to versilov
0	ah , god , how had it happened that all of a sudden i would found myself in a completely different world ?
0	well , done certain things—you can imagine what
0	wait , i will teach him a lesson !
0	but when that failed to help , father zosima had advised him , without giving up his prayers and fasting , to take a certain medicine
0	i see great will power in you , he said , for you were not afraid to do what you considered right in a matter in which you risked making yourself the victim of general contempt
0	what did he need it for when he already occupied the most exalted position in the world ?
0	among the visitors were many jurists , quite a few famous public figures , and also a number of society ladies
0	may you be cursed !
0	still no answer from him
0	ah , what does he know , your doctor ?
0	the gang to which lambert belonged had been formed in moscow and had already carried out quite a number of operations there ( eventually some of the members were caught )
0	ivan stepped up to the table , took the bundle , and started to unwrap it , but suddenly he let it go and drew his fingers away in horror , as if he had touched something slimy and unbearably revolting
0	and although he was not a member of the board of directors , he followed the operations of the company with great interest , attended the shareholders ' meetings , was elected a founding member , made long speeches , opposed motions , made noise , and obviously had a marvelous time
0	now , why is it that i never have hysterics ?
0	yes , there used to be such people then
0	ah , if i had not loved him , i would not have been so overjoyed by his hatred !
0	now for the essentials of my plan
0	after all , it was not so far
0	it was not through any fault of mine that i happened to overhear your secrets
0	you don ’ t look yourself
0	and so he hasn ’ t been to see me for two weeks now and i started wondering whether he ’ d ever come back
0	therefore , with her subtle feminine instinct , anna realized the awkward position she would been maneuvered into : if she said anything against katerina , whom the prince also held in very high esteem ( perhaps more now than ever precisely because she had agreed to his marriage plans with such warmth and consideration ) , if anna made the least attempt to discredit katerina , she would hurt the prince 's tender feelings for his daughter , arouse his distrust of her , and perhaps even provoke his indignation
0	i still do not understand what he meant , but i realize he was in a state of extreme anxiety at that time ( i was later to learn the cause of it )
0	mrs khokhlakov turned toward alyosha and , giving him her elegantly gloved hand , said : she has a message for you , alexei
0	what interest , mr ivan ?
0	but the stories of his fear of fetyukovich were not quite fair
0	and once again gregory repeated with stubborn insistence that he had seen the door leading into the garden open
0	you understand , i was told , it would be just like having a magazine without a criticism section
0	i was on my feet
0	he put on his overcoat
0	it is because she feels guilty toward him that she hates him so at certain moments , alyosha decided
0	but then there were many things i would never have dared to utter in her room despite the fact that i felt immensely at ease there
0	everything that has been written down will be read back to you and if you don ’ t agree with anything , we will make the necessary changes
0	as i was saying all this , she slowly rose from her chair , her face growing pinker and pinker
0	surely it 's not just money that worries katerina ?
0	yes , i ’ m leaving , grushenka said , picking up her shawl from the sofa
0	i say you spent more than a thousand on them , mr karamazov , trifon brushed off mitya ’ s protest with great assurance
0	well , since you have seen that stone , you know how stupid it looks sitting there in the middle of the street , just getting in the way
0	and she would find out ; then she would come and sit down next to me of her own accord , submissive , shy , and tender , hoping to catch my eye , dissolving with joy at the sight of my smile
0	but you yourself , vasin , spoke of emotional beliefs and feelings yesterday
0	but what is he afraid of ?
0	people also love anecdotes connected with the court , like the tales about cherny-shev , a seventy-year-old minister of the late tsar who managed to make himself look like a man of thirty so that the tsar himself was amazed
0	with others , you know , i am the most stern and unsmiling of women !
0	kalganov suddenly became agitated as if a matter of the utmost importance were at stake
0	don ’ t lie to me
0	he wore an expensive bearskin coat and a sable cap
0	this is quite inadmissible !
0	but what offended him most was that he had accepted me too quickly as his friend and had been in too much of a hurry to lower his guard
0	forget it , mitya said , suddenly smiling
0	yes , you , because if you stay there , you will lose everything you have !
0	you are angry with yourself , so you feel the need to take it out on someone else and this time you hope you wo not miss me
0	sofia , the eighteen-year-old serf girl in question—my mother , that is—had lost both her parents six years earlier
0	i had not seen my father , versilov , since i was ten , although during that brief encounter he had managed to leave an indelible impression upon me
0	it is horrible , revolting—i am fully aware of the horror of it
0	murmuring and protesting when one meets death is a great sin
0	she goes around barefoot still , but there ’ s no reason why that should frighten you ; don ’ t turn up your nose at barefoot beggar girls
0	when ivan had inquired impatiently whether that meant that smerdyakov was insane now , he was told that he was not yet insane in the actual , clinical sense but that certain symptoms of insanity had already been observed
0	besides , i had no right whatsoever to be so demanding of him about that debt because , once , she said with a determined note in her voice , i had borrowed money from him myself and it was more than three thousand , and i did so although i was not sure at the time when i would be able to pay him back
0	they never understand one
0	everybody knows that a month ago you spent not just fifteen hundred rubles , but rather three thousand , here
0	why do not you try this instead ?
0	he asked in surprise
0	this feeling may have stemmed indirectly , unconsciously perhaps , from the guilt he felt over having dishonestly spent katerina ’ s money
0	what made it even harder for me was that i was trying to describe it in its original , primitive form
0	i hope the reader will note that i am not sparing myself , that i am presenting myself just as i was at that time , in all my repulsiveness , so that what follows will be understandable
0	besides , a russian woman is never a woman
0	the clear reasoning part of her brain must certainly have been aware of her hero 's lack of character , for how could one deny that the unfortunate man , although generous in his way , was in fact nothing but a poor mediocrity ?
0	i felt sure that we would be interrupted in the course of the day ( that 's why my heart was pounding so ) , in which case perhaps i would not even dare bring up the matter of money
0	she could , of course , do nothing : crying out for help would have been pointless since we would made sure there were not any witnesses around and , besides , she would have felt rather embarrassed to complain
0	wouldn ’ t that be funny , terribly funny ?
0	this was the third time , since his return from moscow , that ivan had been to see smerdyakov
0	for a minute or so we sat in silence
0	but he was talking so emotionally , with tears in his eyes , that i began crying myself ; when he saw that , he suddenly kissed me and then made the sign of the cross over me
0	but then , everybody liked the boy , wherever he went , from his early childhood on
0	you see , perhaps i know much more , as it is , than you do yourself ; it ’ s not information i need from you
0	at that moment i felt there was nothing i could do that would make any difference
0	of course i ca not help noticing it , any young man notices it , every child , and a boy who 's just beginning to
0	however , since the witness had first repeatedly denied an incident which he later admitted to , his whole testimony lost much of its credibility and the inn-keeper ’ s honesty was put very much in question
0	why , you are a clever peasant , aren ’ t you ?
0	this question loomed before him like a monstrous ghost and he stared at that ghost , feeling his flesh freeze in terror
0	the two women rushed into the passage just as they had before , one trying to restrain the other
0	i didn ’ t laugh at all
0	i am sure the papas have heard about perseverance and relentlessness before , but what is needed to achieve my goal is not perseverance and relentlessness as understood by german papas
0	i ’ ve been watching her
0	innkeeper , bring some more bottles !
0	it must be said that rakitin was one of the witnesses the prosecutor considered extremely important and on whose testimony he reckoned greatly
0	i would not have dwelt at such length on such a trivial episode had that peculiar meeting between the young civil servant and the by-no-means elderly widow not become the foundation of the whole future career of this meticulous and methodical young man , a fact which is still remembered with amazement in our town and of which we may yet have a few words to say in the sequel to our long novel about the brothers karamazov
0	i think we really ought to become peasants and till the soil
0	i remember i spoke about her face
0	but first let 's talk about the business at hand
0	he asked me to come and see him that day between one and two o'clock because he had something to tell me that would probably come as a surprise
0	any sensualist can understand that
0	let 's get out of here
0	although it was far from the center , fyodor karamazov ’ s house was not altogether on the outskirts of town
0	true , the arrest of the servant weighed on him heavily , but the man ’ s illness and sudden death released his conscience from that burden , for , he reasoned at the time , the man did not die from shock or fright caused by his arrest but from a cold he had contracted , probably on the night of the murder , after which he had been found sprawled dead drunk on the damp ground
0	no , not yet , but it makes absolutely no difference
0	please , gentlemen , please forgive me for my impatience , he added quickly , checking himself , and once again , believe me , i have the utmost respect for your competence and fully realize the gravity of the situation
0	moreover , i believe they would have been rather disappointed if his guilt could not have been definitely established , because that would have spoiled the dramatic effect of his acquittal
0	and so jealousy surged up in him once more
0	good lord , sir , please
0	now i ’ ll hate you again
0	mon pauvre enfant , i always thought that you must have had many painful moments in your childhood
0	it 's amazing how much older and less handsome you have grown in these nine years !
0	what was it i had really expected from kraft ?
0	mrs khokhlakov cried , her face suddenly becoming radiant at the sight of perkhotin
0	and i embraced him and gave him my blessing and i started to cry
0	and then you will gain not just riches , not just hundreds of thousands or a million , but it will be the whole world that you will gainl today we amass material things without ever satisfying our greed and then we madly squander all we have amassed
0	do not accuse me of being a slavophile
0	they were already in the dining room when miusov , kalganov , and ivan karamazov made their entrance
0	my dear boy , he said , turning to me , i know a cafe around here , a horrible place really , but we could get some tea and i suggest we go there now
0	you won it , pan podwysocki , we trust your word of honor and we keep ours
0	'assuming that a supreme being exists , i said to versilov , 'and exists as a personal entity , not in the form of some diffused creative spirit , a sort of fluid or something ( for that would be even harder to imagine ) , well , if so , where does he reside ?
0	you decided that from my way of walking , madam ?
0	at last mitya looked at his interrogators
0	it feels as though my double is standing here next to me
0	however , let me tell you something quite extraordinary that will interest you
0	and if so , what sort of thing ?
0	how could you say to my face that you were reckoning on my 'impulsiveness ' ?
0	father joseph could not refrain from murmuring , shame , shame
0	but let 's drop that for now , since anyway there was no marriage because of lidia 's death
0	but he would not even consider waiting
0	but life after death—it is such a puzzle and no one , no one at all , has the answer !
0	he was then searched and examined
0	the thought that was tormenting me was this : if he was really spiritually regenerated and now free of his passion for her , where would he most likely be at this moment ?
0	my guiding idea , or rather my feelings , simply amounted to leaving them once and for all ( just as i had resolved a thousand times before ) , but this time i was determined really to do it
0	you ’ re the only one i ’ m not afraid of
0	you stole it from my poem !
0	taken individually , they may be little angels , but in a crowd they ’ re completely without pity
0	to be on the safe side , i decided to stay out of arguments , to say as little as possible , so that no one could say anything about me , but , above all , not to get involved in the discussion
0	and how do you know , my dear boy , that there are no hooks ?
0	ivan took the three bundles of bills and shoved them into his pocket without wrapping them in anything
0	how could you love a man like that ?
0	there will always be some lovely scullery maid for her master , and that ’ s all that ’ s needed to make one happy !
0	having said this , ivan , without waiting for the judge ’ s permission , got up and started to walk away from the witness stand
0	across the table from him , nikolai nelyudov , the examining magistrate , was trying to convince him to take a sip from a glass of water that stood on the table next to him
0	and that wouldn ’ t be so surprising either , lise—you may very well drive me to hysterics with these whims of yours !
0	the apostle thomas said he would not believe until he saw , and when he saw , he said : my lord and my god !
0	there was that fellow belyavsky , rich , good-looking , and all , who took a fancy to her and would hang around here all the time
0	it ’ s all false , false , false !
0	he repeated to himself for the hundredth time , the very thought making him blush
0	and trishatov 's expression was gloomy and sad as he stood looking at me , with his hands in his pockets and without taking off his hat
0	in fact , i am pretty sure it must have been
0	in that case , alyosha , i ’ ll make a clean breast of everything , for there must be someone who knows the whole truth
0	what about my idea ?
0	no , let me make a clean breast of it now
0	you mean there ’ s just nothing , just a vacuum ?
0	yes , it was really great !
0	but then i thought up something else
0	i want to think only of sweet alyosha , while i look at him
0	he was a very dangerous opponent , even though , because of his vow of silence , he hardly ever spoke to anyone
0	you may be wrong there !
0	but nelyudov , who stood nearest to him , quickly and nervously hid his hands behind his back
0	vanya , how will all this horrible business end between father and mitya ?
0	this caused the opponents of the elders to accuse them , among other things , of arbitrarily and irresponsibly degrading the sacrament of confession , although the continual baring of a novice ’ s or a layman ’ s soul before his elder was quite different from that sacrament
0	but without doubt the overwhelming majority of the monks were on zosima ’ s side , and many of them loved him deeply and sincerely
0	considering , however , the damage he could do himself by refusing to answer , especially with questions as important as this one , he should perhaps
0	this has always been his way of dealing with his children , legitimate or illegitimate
0	then , two years later , he sued me for that sum and with the accumulated interest too , and then surprised me again by literally going around and begging coppers for the building of a church
0	what does it matter one way or the other , my boy ?
0	and with all those people in town against him , constantly saying he ’ s the murderer !
0	lise laughed nervously again
0	but could it really be due to your friendship with that princeling ?
0	surely it must have occurred to him that anna might very well have been aware of his liaison with lisa , since they were after all sisters , or , if she did not yet know of it , she was very likely to find out about it sooner or later
0	so let 's get down to business now
0	his face had turned dark purple and he was shaking all over
0	or perhaps we could put it this way : it ’ s not an attempt to conciliate him , to stop him from lodging a complaint—i understand he was thinking of suing dmitry—it ’ s simply out of sympathy , out of a desire to help him
0	tell me , your excellency , i asked him , is it possible for a true lady to breathe fresh air into herself ?
0	but before miusov could answer this sarcasm , they were asked to come in
0	they needed four and a half thousand and , in addition , they lost about two hundred rubles in cashing the letter of credit
0	there are simple and unaffected souls who trust everybody and are not aware of the ridiculous
0	but you need not worry , it just came up when we were talking about something else
0	she was almost out of breath
0	i ’ m anything you like , but not a thief
0	and if it is true that children share the responsibility for the sins committed by their fathers , then that concept must be true in some different world from the world i know , and it is quite beyond my grasp
0	well , there may be : versilov acted a bit too quickly and perhaps not all that sincerely really , vasin said with a smile
0	yes , i have , mitya said with a sly wink
0	today is the finale of the last act and the curtain will come down
0	where is she , where ?
0	a dog ’ s death for a dog !
0	mitya asked and started turning out one pocket after the other
0	on another occasion he would have waited until the effect produced by perezvon had worn off
0	he felt it during that moment of rapture
0	and no one saw us then , no one except god , and i only hope that he will put it into my service record ; if so , you can thank your dear brother for me , mr alexei karamazov , but i ’ m afraid i won ’ t give my boy a whipping even to satisfy you
0	so he left stamping his feet
0	i wish you would heard him in those days when he kept cornering everyone and asking them such things as 'what do you eat ?
0	so you ’ ve come back from the dead , have you , von sohn ?
0	but whose responsibility is it that he became like that ?
0	why don ’ t you stop carrying on about that ?
0	besides , i will have a lot to say about him as i go on with my story
0	for that too , arkady , i have to rely on your influence on him , and i know how fond of him you are
0	there 's no crowd there
0	oh , no doubt of it—everybody is fine in his own way
0	yes , since thut time he 's had eyes for no one but me
0	on the other hand , your other brother , mr ivan , sent me very early this morning to mr dmitry ’ s place on lake street , to tell mr dmitry—he gave me no letter to deliver—to be at the inn on the square today without fail and that they ’ d eat lunch together there
0	then why are you shaking ?
0	ah , you ignorant creature , i say , do you think you ’ re going to teach me or what ?
0	did you say it wasn ’ t ?
0	lambert is a realist !
0	he had been terribly anxious to see ivan ever since the morning
0	what about starting with god ?
0	but who could it be ?
0	now , let 's be on our way , peter !
0	my dear fellow , let me tell you—intelligence isn ’ t everything
0	and now i have no idea what to do about it
0	i sat down at his table and told him everything i would learned about lisa and sergei and about my scene with sergei the previous night following the session at the roulette table , mentioning , of course , my win
0	i do not want to and i am not going to
0	no one tried to stop me from leaving and i did not go into the living room to say good-by to my mother as i did not want to see versilov again
0	not just you and versilov but also anna versilov , who is just as much your sister as lisa dolgoruky !
0	besides these three , i can only remember two faces , one belonging to a tall twenty-seven-year-old man with black sideburns , a teacher or something , who spoke with great volubility , and a young fellow , my age perhaps , with a peculiar frown , who wore a russian peasant 's coat and mostly listened , saying little
0	and if this , or something of the sort , could have happened , doesn ’ t that make the whole charge of theft quite unfounded ?
0	he pointed at the case with the pistols
0	she asked me about makar and his death ; i told her and one might have assumed it was over makar 's death that i was crying , although at this point that would have been quite ridiculous and she could not possibly have thought me capable of such childish sentimentality
0	i have read the book against which you argue in your article , he said , turning to ivan , and i was quite taken aback by the words the church is a kingdom not of this world ’ coming from an ecclesiastic
0	that ’ s very probable , alyosha cried excitedly
0	that mysterious warning made me lose my temper completely
0	no , he can ’ t , because he ’ s too ignorant to have any feelings at all
0	and so when she agrees to everything , i mean when she pays up the money as well as the other ransom—in kind , you know ( she 's sure to agree , being vile like all women ) —just at that moment , versilov and i will burst in to witness her ignominy
0	he got up from his armchair and started pacing up and down the room , apparently unaware of it himself
0	besides , the accused accounted clearly and without equivocation for the origin of that money , and his explanation , i submit , is very much in keeping with the accused ’ s personality and character
0	and i did not feel like weeping now ; instead , a feeling of spite quite unexpectedly got hold of me
0	at last the maid had finished lighting the fire
0	she ’ s really impossible today , and i ’ m afraid she ’ ll only get more irritated if we stay
0	and combined with such a charming manner and such good looks !
0	in fact , everything that i have been describing in such seemingly unnecessary detail will be understood at the proper time
0	there 's no need for him to make up for anything : i simply do not want to have anything to do with him , i do not !
0	yes , i remember , until , until
0	please go and see her , alyosha , and ask her not to say anything about that in court
0	the presiding judge rang his bell with all his might
0	no , i haven ’ t been introduced to her , but i ’ ve heard of her and i ’ ve seen her
0	the wailing only assuages by further lacerating and exasperating the heart
0	you do often go to see her , and you told me yourself that you ’ d never been her lover
0	and the conviction that , after his death , zosima would confer great glory on the monastery was , perhaps , stronger in alyosha than in anyone else at the monastery
0	he stayed at the paternal house only a short time , leaving as soon as he had managed to get a very small sum from the old man , together with some vague agreement about sending him the revenue from his estate
0	that ’ s just his normal way of shaking hands , grushenka said , smiling but still looking apprehensively at dmitry
0	i think you are exaggerating the importance of the whole thing
0	please do—of course , the examining magistrate said
0	ah , how you like to play games , lisa !
0	until very recently alyosha had felt that this was a quite inconceivable slander , but it had nevertheless worried him a great deal
0	this one was not dressed like a pilgrim but wore ordinary town clothes
0	it must sound like some crazy story to you , like some ballad in prose , and , of course , you ’ re not at all likely to believe a fellow !
0	i will try to convey just the gist of what i heard , for the chances are that i missed many details : i was too excited to take in everything
0	so he never told even you , mother ?
0	at any rate , there 's too much guesswork involved
0	you ’ re thinking about the obscenities in it ?
0	and why won ’ t he acknowledge it ?
0	it may sound paradoxical too that what i liked most about the letter ( just a small sheet of note paper ) was the fact that there was no mention of my entering the university , no attempt to persuade me to reconsider my decision and to complete my education ; in short , he did not indulge in all those paternal pretty phrases that are used in such cases
0	the very thought of what will happen just kills me !
0	they ’ re breeding all over the place these days !
0	and why would he kill the old man ?
0	first , a recitative , played very softly , but full of suffering and terror , while the choir thunders grimly , sternly , and impersonally , wouldies irae , dies illa !
0	but prince sokolsky will never accept your challenge , lisa said
0	so i first inquired about his wife 's health and we went to pay her a visit
0	my answer to that is : who were the people who knew he didn ’ t have any money ?
0	and it was with love that i looked at him—i am certain of it , for i knew now what to do
0	there stebelkov is completely wrong , vasin said with a special emphasis that struck me and that i still remember very clearly
0	you really see no difference ?
0	he did not keep the fasts according to the rules of his order—that is why the sign is here
0	but we will come to that later
0	but it was not only her hands that she was ashamed of ; she was ashamed of everything about herself , although it was her beauty that i loved
0	and here i would like to suggest , in all humility , that perhaps this very awareness of the impossibility of loving might lead to an eventual alleviation of the sinners ’ torments , for , by accepting the love of the righteous along with the impossibility of their responding to it , through the resignation and humility which would result from that acceptance , they might come to experience a feeling resembling the active love they neglected on earth
0	as to mitya ’ s striking him in the face and knocking him down , gregory said that he held no grudge for that and had forgiven him long ago
0	vasin kept smiling and did not seem in the least surprised
0	in this promise , as in any other the dying elder had ever made , father paisii believed so completely that , had he seen father zosima unconscious and no longer breathing after he had promised to get up and say good-by to him , he would have distrusted even death itself and expected the dying man to regain consciousness and carry out his promise
0	it was a bedroom with trunks and suitcases next to two large beds , which were piled high with pillows in cotton calico covers
0	katya has despised me for months—i ’ ve been aware of it
0	i never expected such an outburst from you !
0	ivan lowered his eyes , waited for a few moments , and then looked up again and said with a sort of stammer :
0	you must ask your landlady , lambert , to rent us another room , and it 's there that i will be waiting with versilov
0	in the meantime , they had walked quite a distance down the path and suddenly smurov cried :
0	there 's no other kind of friendship ; there ca not be ; it 's just a myth invented by impractical people
0	it was a small , folded , sealed sheet of paper
0	here , fenya , get him a candle
0	i see that you know everything !
0	i feel very sorry for lisa
0	would you like a wet towel on your head ?
0	the two villagers and andrei confirmed unhesitatingly what trifon had said
0	yes , i just dream and dream ; my whole life has become nothing but a daydream until i daydream even at night
0	i am sure you disagree with me
0	he glanced quickly at the door , looked around him , and , leaning toward me from the sofa , said in anxious whispers :
0	no one answered him
0	were you hoping to bring the man you had struck back to life ?
0	a thick book in a yellow cover lay on the table , but smerdyakov was not reading it and , in fact , seemed to have been just sitting there doing nothing
0	well , i thought it was an opening for some amiable chit-chat , so i said , why , yes , sir , i must say i have
0	i would given the matter of food lots of thought : i decided , for instance , sometimes to eat nothing but bread and salt for two days in a row and then on the third day spend on food whatever i would saved from my daily allowance
0	prince sergei , i whispered
0	go on , go on , find out !
0	his face had changed with the usual speed
0	unless you , too , believe that running away would be dishonorable , unheroic , or what have you—perhaps un-christian ?
0	life is so good when you do something that is good and just
0	all the rest of the world is just wonderful !
0	well , this happened early in our nineteenth century , during the darkest days of serfdom—and , by the way , long live our tsar alexander ii , the liberator of the people !
0	well , for your information , alexei , your dear brother is a low , despicable man
0	he kissed both her hands again and gently stroked her cheeks ; then he took the napkin from the table and wiped away her tears with it
0	nekrasov describes the poor , feeble nag , trying in vain to pull an overloaded cart which is stuck in the mud
0	he looked less self-assured than he had the day before but was in a state of great excitement like a man who finds himself at the center of very important events
0	for one thing , he drank too much , so much , in fact , that he had not been able to get a job any more and had to live on handouts before maxim had hired him
0	i knew he needed money and i knew what he needed it for : it was to entice that creature to go away with him
0	if they think evil of him now , the thought flashed through my head , let them know the whole truth !
0	alyosha and the boys followed close behind him
0	there are many of them , and we all bear the responsibility for them !
0	and it was not just the way he treated me that won me over
0	i called out to katerina again and rushed after the carriage
0	the prosecutor said he did not wish ’ or dare ’ —those are his own words—to touch upon that romance
0	as to the letter about which i had come to seek his advice earlier , i did not mention it and told him that i would just come to pay him a friendly visit before
0	he could stand on his feet , he could speak , but who knows what was going on inside him ?
0	what did you two quarrel about this time ?
0	there was no bidding
0	i can see that you have all kinds of silly ideas about things
0	he looked happy and there was a spark of joy in his eyes
0	in fact , i rejoiced inwardly , because i felt that god had taken mercy on that man , who had risen up against himself and had asked for the punishment he deserved
0	i ’ d just laugh in their faces !
0	one of them is a young gentleman , a relative of mr miusov ’ s i believe , but i ’ ve forgotten his name
0	no , there ’ s obviously something else to it , something quite original
0	the elder moved toward dmitry and , when he was close to him , he went down on his knees before him
0	today everyone asserts his own personality and strives to live a full life as an individual
0	but at times he also suspected that ivan ’ s lack of interest and sympathy might be due to other causes about which he knew nothing
0	so it was you who had that letter sewn up inside your pocket !
0	i must check on that
0	but i don ’ t want to believe , and there ’ s nothing that will make me believe , in you !
0	and just as she had before , she stopped him in the hall
0	he did know the prince but would not tell me under what circumstances he would met him
0	i kissed him enthusiastically
0	since the age of twelve , i believe , when i became fully conscious of things , i have disliked my fellow men
0	yes , at one moment he looked at me and my heart was filled with horror at what that man was preparing for himself
0	but what i am interested in is what will become of him
0	gentlemen of the jury , what is a father , a real father ?
0	no , i am no prince , i am just plain dolgoruky , and i am the son of my former master , mr versilov
0	then i disposed of my dinner by throwing the soup either out the window into the nettles or you know where and feeding the meat to the dog or , wrapping it up in paper , smuggling it out in my pocket and flingling it far away from the house
0	er , but then it must be done at once , right away , without delay !
0	so why did you have to humiliate yourself like that before an impudent upstart , a mere adolescent like me ?
0	there are quite a few things you ’ ll have to explain to me , my good fellow , and you ’ d better get out of your head , once and for all , the notion that you can play games with me !
0	yes , my brothers too , alyosha said , with some hesitation
0	nevertheless , he still resists it and goes first to see mrs khokhlakov , one of the most respected citizens in our town
0	when a little bird sings or all those many , many stars shine in the sky at night—it 's all mystery , the same one
0	what if i should put a curse on you ?
0	but i have mother , i have lisa
0	ah , we ’ re all so glad you ’ re here
0	he said , examining the bottle
0	of course , the presiding judge and the prosecutor tried to calm her , and i ’ m sure they felt rather embarrassed at taking advantage of her hysterical outburst to hear her confession
0	again , they assured him that , although mr kalganov was a little taller and somewhat slighter , he was exaggerating the difference in their builds , that the clothes fitted well enough , except perhaps the trousers , which were a bit too long
0	although , as i write this down now , the conversation strikes me as rather funny , especially my style of that period , my feelings on the subject have remained unchanged
0	that same winter she was with child , and they went from church to church and prayed while waiting in fear and trembling for god 's verdict
0	that would be hopeless anyway , for , as they say , you may throw nature out the door , but it will come back through the window
0	your brains must be turning soft !
0	listen , in dreams and particularly in nightmares , caused perhaps by indigestion or whatever , a man may think up such artistic creations , such complex and realistic visions , events or even a whole world of events woven into a plot full of such astounding details that leo tolstoi himself could not invent them
0	no , sir , she didn ’ t
0	he said quietly , and looked searchingly at every one of us in turn
0	in general , this is a peculiar feature of simple people : they are never contented with an abstract idea and always demand concrete and precise details
0	he looked at me piteously
0	he was almost choking
0	and i myself , do you imagine i ’ ll be able to live there among those completely strange natives , even though every one of them may be a much better man than i am
0	nothing doing , not like that
0	well , i want you to know that i was deliberately testing you—i wanted to find out if it was possible to get along with you , whether there was room for my humility next to your pride
0	i think i forgot something here , he said , my handkerchief or something
0	i didn ’ t think it would make much difference at that point whether i died a thief or a man of honor
0	yes , i saw him
0	how could you imagine that i would consider going to prince nikolai and asking him to lend me money after what you have just told me ?
0	but now that is quite clear to me
0	this is a heroic deed on your part
0	this tone and the casual way in which alyosha had accepted came as such a surprise to rakitin that he almost jumped back upon hearing it
0	so let ’ s go , fellow
0	however i will take all the punishment and tell it to the end
0	that was rather clever , i must say !
0	perkhotin said , sounding really worried now
0	i understand why you got a bit carried away , misha—from your heated tone i guess you ’ re not quite indifferent to katerina yourself
0	it is by blessing that one is blessed
0	this is the explanation i have to offer now as i look back at that episode , although at the time i had other things to think of than an analysis of my actions
0	when it got dark and the shutters were closed , fenya asked grushenka :
0	and he even wept
0	she was listening , he muttered angrily to himself , but alyosha heard him
0	anyone seeing his face would have understood that he was not laughing because he felt in a laughing mood
0	and now to go on with my story
0	as soon as the public was seated , there was complete silence
0	yes , he did , grushenka said with a sigh
0	tell me , what do you think they will do to them ?
0	yes , that ’ s just what he said
0	did your brother tell you that he planned to kill his father ?
0	with you alone i feel like a decent person at certain moments , for i ’ m really a wicked man
0	then martha takes a towel , dips it in the solution , and rubs it all over his back for maybe half an hour , until the towel is completely dry , and usually her face is all red by the time she ’ s through
0	you know nothing about women of that type , and i ’ ve heard that this one is the worst of them all
0	ivan asked dmitry to meet him at the inn for lunch today ?
0	mitya was anxious to tell everything with the utmost accuracy and in all possible detail
0	but when he saw me at sergei 's , he never even made a hint to remind me about that note of his
0	but all the time he watched smerdyakov with great curiosity
0	what sort of nonsense is that ?
0	the general demanded , and he was informed that the boy had hit it with a stone
0	then he adjusted the red kerchief more becomingly around his head
0	i know only too well how it all came about
0	and shall i tell you who told me ?
0	on the bed on the right , there was only one little pillow
0	he had wanted to meet him for a long time
0	oh , we were all so anxious to do good in those days , to do our duty as citizens , to serve a higher ideal ; we wanted to do away with all class privileges and distinctions , with our family estates , and even with pawnshops , at least some of us did
0	your landlord was blabbering something , but since he could not tell me where you were i left in such a huff that i even forgot to leave a message with him that you should come to the house as quickly as possible
0	i was well aware that my comrades laughed at me and despised me for this , but that was just what gave me special pleasure : well , since you wanted me to be a lackey , i became a lackey , and if you wish me to be a pig , i will be a pig !
0	tonight he ’ ll think of it even more , he ’ ll dream of it , and by morning perhaps he ’ ll be ready to hurry to me and beg me to forgive him
0	what makes it so particularly disgraceful to separate fifteen hundred from three thousand that you had anyway appropriated rather shamefully , even disgracefully ?
0	he ’ ll never give it to you , mitya
0	i mean to apologize to him in whatever way he considers satisfactory
0	and you , charlemagne , napoleon , shakespeare , and pushkin !
0	but time was running short and agafia , who was to look after the children as soon as she came in , had not yet returned from market
0	evidently the landlady , and perhaps the other lodgers , had rushed to the room next door
0	in my great ability to accommodate myself to anything , which is so characteristic of the russian intellectuals of our generation
0	but that ’ s realism , sir , sheer realism !
0	now , by dispatching daria to me with that address , anna seemed to have planned this move in advance and it struck me as quite cynical : despite my refusal to cooperate with her , she dismissed what i would said as mere pretense and was sending me to deal with lambert directly
0	can you remember all that , misha ?
0	i most certainly will
0	you say she got out of there without kissing it !
0	as for you , most holy man , allow me only to express my profound admiration !
0	i suspect it may be an awful decision , but i feel i will stick by it as long as i live and nothing will make me change it
0	but with every day that is left to me i feel that my earthly life is already blending into a new , infinite , unknown , future life , anticipation of which sets my soul atremble with ecstasy , makes my mind glow and my heart weep with joy
0	i have received enough embroidery from them to cover a good sixty cushions with nothing but dogs and deer !
0	you ’ re a karamazov , as much a karamazov as the rest ; your breed and natural selection must count for something
0	but the main reason for the church ’ s keeping aloof is that the law of the church is the only true law and it can not , therefore , make the slightest concession to any other law or even accept a temporary compromise
0	well , that 's a mystery to me
0	his tone was frank and unaffected as he addressed the elder
0	and i want you to know , my dear boy , that all warnings and salutary advice are nothing but gratuitous impositions upon another man 's conscience
0	what do you mean—deliberately ?
0	but if i were rothschild , where would piron or even talleyrand be if they tried to outshine me ?
0	my ability to reason and even my capacity to feel were drained so that if i would given in and committed a crime ( which i almost did !
0	besides , it will be more seemly for you to live in the monastery than to stay here with an old drunkard like me , and with all these sluts , though nothing could sully you , clean angel that you are
0	what do you mean , it isn ’ t real ?
0	it 's a long time since i have been angry with anyone
0	to which piece of information , the fellow 's only comment was : tu-lu-lu !
0	i can see the sun , and if i can ’ t see the sun , i know there is the sun
0	i restrained myself for a long time , but suddenly it became more than i could bear and i told him , in the presence of all my family , that he was wasting his time and mine in coming to see me , that i would recover just as well without him , that , although he pretended to be a realist , he was filled with all sorts of superstitions and prejudices , that he refused to understand that medicine had never healed anyone , that he seemed to be crassly ignorant , and that recently anybody who claimed to be a technician or an expert of some sort in russia treated people as if they were dirt
0	at first versilov instinctively held his head between his shoulders so as not to hit the ceiling , but he soon realized that there was headroom where he stood ; he relaxed and sat down on the sofa , now looking quite at ease ; it did not seem to bother him at all that my bed had already been made up
0	come , join us , sit down , have some coffee—it ’ s lenten , for sure , but it ’ s nice and hot !
0	as long as there were still atoms , the five senses , the four elements , well , it all fitted together somehow
0	your past relations and quarrels with her are , of course , quite an unsuitable subject for us to discuss , and i am sure it would have been just plain stupid for me to try and bring it up
0	i can not speak for the others but , on me personally , mitya made a most unpleasant impression
0	it was ugly , unfair , and unkind
0	vigilant alphonsine cried out at once
0	there are simple and loving hearts that must be treated with gentle care whenever possible
0	vasin heard me out attentively but with complete detachment
0	even if father wishes to tell me a secret , there ’ s still no reason why ivan shouldn ’ t see me come in
0	what the russian people need is flogging , as mr karamazov said yesterday , and he was right , crazy as he is with those sons of his
0	i want to know—that 's what i am trying to find out from you
0	i want everything brought up and opened as soon as it arrives , and i want the champagne served immediately
0	he smiled again , but now almost with hatred in his look
0	perhaps she had no control over the circumstances and could not change them ?
0	now , what about you , would it be going too far for you to have a drink with me ?
0	all the time i was playing the fool i was secretly listening and observing , and now it ’ s time for me to give you the last act of my performance
0	besides , agafia will feed you
0	kuzma samsonov must have seen all this within a minute , although his face remained cold and expressionless , like the face of an idol
0	and the same goes for an englishman or a german
0	how does he come down to you , in what shape ?
0	but he never gave a thought at the time to the fact that he had shed innocent blood and taken the life of a human being
0	the main thing about it was that it was humiliating for him , whereas they were in a position to treat him with condescension and contempt
0	smurov told me about it
0	they will marvel at us and worship us like gods , because , by becoming their masters , we have accepted the burden of freedom that they were too frightened to face , just because we have agreed to rule over them—that is how terrifying freedom will have become to them finally !
0	indeed , i found it very funny
0	finally general akhmakov began to give in , realizing the determination of his lovesick daughter , who , as kraft put it , had been mesmerized by versilov
0	why are you trembling ?
0	the prosecutor turned to the examining magistrate and in a gravely decisive tone told him :
0	yes , but he ’ s here too
0	she asks you to forgive her for having told papa about the money
0	also , i remembered what anna had made me understand the day before to my great surprise—namely , that the old prince might make use of my apartment to get married
0	i said , no longer restraining myself
0	can ’ t we go without them ?
0	just about fifteen minutes earlier , grushenka had left for mokroye
0	yes , that but ’ is just the thing !
0	you ’ ve no need to be in such a rush to get rid of it all
0	well , you see then , the landlord cried with obvious relief ; he had not noticed versilov 's wink and was pleased to be allowed to continue his story , hoping there would not be any further heckling
0	mitya answered smartly and clearly , but somehow in an unexpectedly loud voice that made the presiding judge sit up slightly , looking almost surprised
0	he added in complete hopelessness
0	the prosecutor had been watching him all the time he was talking and when he had finished he remarked in a cold , detached tone , almost casually :
0	also , he had no doubts that it would be to him and to no one else that i would go the day i was strong enough to leave the house : daria had come to see me partly on his orders , so he knew that my curiosity and my fears had already been aroused and reckoned that i would not be able to hold out
0	the sickness lasted eight days
0	so it 's me who 's insisting , and you must know why
0	i only registered her saying that it was all sham , the outpourings of a despicable mind , moreover deliberately twisted and turned inside out
0	i noticed that this former university student was surprisingly ignorant and that practically nothing interested him
0	where are you , ma ?
0	and you have already repeated it to grushenka
0	he had only forgotten gott der heilige geist , but i reminded him of it and i again felt very sorry for him
0	he repeated to her his entire conversation with smerdyakov , every word of it , and was unable to relax despite all her efforts to calm him
0	but all these rumors and arguments did not in the least change the general sympathy for the poor holy fool ; in fact , the opposite was true—people showed even more kindness and concern for her
0	he has exhausted you !
0	you ’ re right , absolutely right
0	as a matter of fact , i may still kill someone , even if i remain rich , for what use is it to just sit around doing nothing ?
0	ivan cried , a very worried look appearing on his face
0	don ’ t worry , soon you ’ ll be able to go to bed and get some sleep
0	in gogol , too , you understand , it ’ s all meant allegorically , for all the names he gives his characters are allegorical too
0	not really , versilov said , getting up and reaching for his hat
0	do not get angry , arkasha , mother said , but it would be so nice if you could really stop
0	for it was the time when they were proclaiming atheism
0	his use of the word document had given me a jolt
0	even if his act was very brave , i still think he would not have sinned if he had renounced christ on that occasion , as well as his own baptismal vows , so as to save his life for good works , which in time would have made up for his moment of weakness
0	but five or six months later , the town discovered with shock and horror that lizaveta was pregnant
0	he had even slipped into a sort of light-headedness
0	only an hour ago i thought i would not be able to bring myself to touch that monster , just as i can ’ t touch reptiles
0	what is so strange and extraordinary is not that god really exists but that such a thought—the very idea of the necessity of god—should have occurred to a vicious wild animal like man , for that concept is so holy , so touching , and so wise that it does man too much honor
0	dmitry stood up , held a finger to his forehead , and for a moment stood there deep in thought
0	indeed , the reader might be sufficiently taken in to believe that a scene from past history could take place in the present
0	i couldn ’ t catch her
0	you ’ ll tell me about it next sunday !
0	and the girls—you could get them out of bed , like the other time
0	he looked extremely uneasy , feeling certain that a scandal would be unavoidable now
0	it was very late , but ivan had still not gone to bed
0	i had , of course , never seen her before and i could not imagine how i would talk to her , if i were to talk to her at all
0	i have chosen it not for any special reason except that somehow i remember it best
0	i ’ ve long considered you an exceptional person and respected you , kolya started again , feeling he was about to get mixed up
0	and that was the man stebelkov wanted
0	the truth is that during the entire preceding day , despite all my shocking experiences , my thoughts had kept returning to my success at zershikov 's gambling saloon
0	you ’ re leaving me now ?
0	so i raised my finger and i said to him : my boy , i said , gott der vater
0	forgive me , please , i was under the impression , ivan , that—ha-ha-ha !
0	take me away , grushenka said weakly
0	what he thought of me i don ’ t know , but i do know that if the same circumstances were repeated today , i would react in exactly the same way , show the same emotions , use the same words , make the same gestures , the same movements
0	tell me , is he in love with her too ?
0	before he fell asleep , he prayed for mitya and for ivan
0	i was thinking that even if i believed that life was pointless , lost faith in the woman i loved , lost faith in the order of things , or even became convinced that i was surrounded by a disorderly , evil , perhaps devil-made chaos , even if i were completely overcome by the horrors of human despair—i would still want to live on ; once i have started drinking from this cup , i won ’ t put it down until i have emptied it to the last drop
0	he suddenly stood up and started pacing the room
0	quite an adventurous lady otherwise , is not she !
0	he was very well aware of this , but he pretended it was gregory who had asked them
0	all right—it was mr miusov here , who just now was so furious about diderot
0	oh no , it damn well makes all the difference in the world , because if there ’ s no ceiling , there aren ’ t any hooks either , and if there aren ’ t any hooks , then the whole idea goes to pieces
0	so a well-dressed lady walked in and asked is it you who advertised about lessons in the newspaper ?
0	that ’ s my motto , children , my own dear little suckling pigs
0	but then , in the mood i was in , nothing would have pleased me
0	suddenly it struck him that ivan rolled slightly as he walked , listing to the right , so that from behind it seemed to alyosha that his right shoulder was lower than his left
0	i must therefore explain right now what mrs prutkov meant by the noose when she blurted out that word
0	yes , my best regards , just like that
0	i mean in obtaining your acquittal
0	it was , indeed , nothing more than a hut
0	so i decided to write a letter of appreciation to the newspapers—that ’ s how grateful i felt !
0	actually , i ’ m only doing it for your sake , he told our mother
0	why would you go to see her otherwise ?
0	now i feel the presence of god and my heart rejoices
0	what he needed was a draftsman , an artist , an engraver , a lithographer , and also a chemist and a technician all this for a certain specific purpose
0	i rapped out from the doorway
0	you know , there ’ s someone here i love , and guess who it is ?
0	this was the baron
0	we ’ ll return to russia as american citizens
0	there ’ s your father over there
0	i gave you money that belonged to me and you knew it and took it , while i had to bear that loathsome comedy in my own house !
0	who knows what could happen
0	he is a future member of the diplomatic corps , i ’ m certain !
0	the children now looked at the powder with an awe which increased their fascination still more
0	i felt that it could have awful consequences later , such as slander , and , alas , that is indeed what eventually came out of it !
0	his second marriage lasted eight years
0	and it was the indefinable origin of his anxiety that was causing it to increase in him now
0	he appeared meek and subdued
0	at night , in the darkness , i ’ d sob into my pillow , thinking of it all the time , trying to calm myself by repeating again and again : i ’ ll pay him back , i ’ ll pay him back , for everything , everything ’
0	i decided to take care of the child with your mother 's permission
0	alyosha noticed it and compassion stirred in his heart
0	i am willing to yield to her because she 's the weaker creature , but why should she take it for granted and consider it my duty ?
0	and who will accept what you say of freedom in the way you want it to be understood ?
0	grushenka in her house ?
0	this strange remark was almost the last line of the entry
0	there are moments when people love crime , alyosha said thoughtfully
0	maxim sat there like in a stupor
0	you could have guessed because i was pleading with you to go to chermashnya instead of moscow , that ’ s how
0	she didn ’ t like ivan , though , and was cool toward him
0	he , at least , has something to be sad about : he has revolted against his god and was even getting ready to devour some salami
0	he was aiming at you !
0	was he named for alexei the man of god ?
0	my client grew up under no one ’ s protection but god ’ s , which means he grew up as wild animals do
0	she was frightened by the shouting and hid herself in the bushes
0	mr karamazov was unable to show his son where he had buried his second wife for , once the coffin had been lowered into the earth , he had never returned to visit her grave and , since that had been many years before , he had entirely forgotten where the grave was
0	no pity , no compassion for lisa , could stop me now
0	the elder smiled gently
0	she ignored my remark and suddenly started to talk
0	oh , there are a thousand witnesses who will tell you that !
0	i don ’ t know how to put it , but i ’ ve observed it myself
0	wait , he said , the boy had not haunted me all year until now , but last night he came to me in my dream
0	for more than a month he had been hearing from various sources that ivan was in love with katerina and , above all , that he was trying to take her away from mitya
0	but how can i tell you what i so long to tell you ?
0	nekrasov has a poem in which a peasant whips his horse , aiming at the animal ’ s eyes—the horse ’ s gentle eyes
0	karamazov proceeded immediately to exploit his son ’ s weakness , putting him off with small sums
0	and now let me tell you the whole truth , gentlemen !
0	for the time being , ivan writes theological articles , although he is an atheist and admits that he does not seriously mean what he says in them , and he does it all for some strange , idiotic reasons
0	and how 's your sister lisa ?
0	alyosha yelled in pain , trying to pull his finger away
0	well , the intelligent people
0	but what choice did i have ?
0	first of all , though , they made a thorough investigation and found that it really was possible to flatten oneself out between the rails so that the train would pass over you without touching you ; but to actually lie still while the thing rattled deafeningly over your head—that was something else again !
0	let me tell you once and for all what i think about that , mitya
0	my god—i haven ’ t seen so much money in four years !
0	listen , did you laugh at me very much when you read it ?
0	i picked an unrelated pretext , trying to ridicule his opinion on an important political event—this was in
0	so , holy men , you can see what kind of a father he is—whether he has the right to accuse his son of disorderly behavior !
0	we finally succeeded in making the mother drink two cups of tea , even if it took a lot of pleading , persuading , and almost force
0	but who 's talking about dying , prince ?
0	mitya ran at full speed , and the few people he passed were to testify later that they had seen him galloping madly through the streets on that particular night
0	and as i was telling him , he all of a sudden jumped up and started swearing like a madman
0	i stared at her , my eyes almost popping out , so much so , in fact , that i began to see double and saw two alphonsines in front of me
0	anyway , i had decided to hear him out to the end
0	tell me , why did you come out and talk to me just now after all that had happened ?
0	as the visiting monk recounted later , he approached the shack with immense apprehension
0	oh , i agree with the court and the prosecution that ivan karamazov was feverish and that his testimony could have been a desperate attempt , perhaps conceived in a feverish state , to save his brother by blaming a dead man for the crime
0	when , thus silenced , kostya still felt his sister was wrong , he would appeal to kolya , whose verdict was final and could not be appealed further
0	but that money you showed me just now
0	the interrogators were extremely interested to hear that mitya had offered the pole three thousand rubles—seven hundred rubles down , the balance of twenty-three hundred to be paid in town in the morning
0	that 's only what people say who have never tried anything , who have never even started to live , and who have grown stiff from sitting motionless amidst things as they found them
0	the leader of the two , that is , the little pole , turned out to be a retired civil servant of the twelfth class , who had served in siberia as a veterinarian
0	well , he ’ s the one i had in mind
0	the questioners were silent for a moment
0	they were sitting facing each other at the table at which versilov and i had so recently drunk to his regeneration
0	listen , alyosha , ivan will surpass everybody
0	behind him could be seen a whole crowd of monks who had accompanied him , and even some laymen too
0	i thought i must have done something wrong but that i would mend my ways somehow and would be forgiven
0	i ’ d have beaten her mercilessly !
0	i wept then and put my arms around him and kissed him
0	why , the earthly queen , of course , that ideal of yours !
0	you ’ re just like her , just like the crazy woman
0	he was pleased to predict on that occasion that , if i decided in the near future that the career of an archimandrite was not for me , and that i would not be tonsured , i would be sure to go off to petersburg , that i would get myself onto the staff of some thick magazine , in the literary section , of course
0	then she wept and now she plunges the knife into katya ’ s heart
0	i can just imagine a polish gambler giving away a million like that !
0	her face was contorted
0	dead people smell even worse
0	it ’ s impossible to tell in advance when one is going to have a fit
0	and she certainly knew how to listen , something i would always been very bad at
0	when the old man appeared at the opposite end of the room , about sixty feet away from him , mitya stood up at once and walked toward the old man with his long , firm military stride
0	where ’ s the wise governor of the feast ?
0	in fact , i had a feeling that she would come especially with that purpose in mind
0	so now we are even
0	that i can tell , and that 's why i sent them packing
0	everything took place in an atmosphere of squalor and dirt , which , indeed , must have held an attraction for some people
0	all this , you did not think it up yourself
0	i was very pale
0	did you hear , porfiry ?
0	in the dresden museum there 's a claude lorrain painting listed in the catalogue as 'acis and galatea , but i somehow always called it 'the golden age
0	mitya cried , opening his eyes , sitting up on the trunk as if he had come to after a fainting fit , and smiling brightly
0	i think that 's so terribly true !
0	but the end will come soon and they will have to pay dearly for their fun
0	ivan ’ s face twitched in a peculiar way
0	i have that feeling , and i could have it just from being so afraid
0	grushenka leapt up at once
0	i swear it 's true
0	you see , my back-scrubber used to be thicker before , i mean , no more than a week ago—i ’ m referring , of course , to my beard , which the schoolboys have nicknamed a back-scrubber
0	that ’ s right , they ’ re not asleep !
0	it would only be one more terrible sin toward my departed little darlings
0	none of this became known until later , but while he was alive samsonov did help grushenka with advice on how to run her own operations and he would now and then throw some good thing her way
0	he claims , for one thing , that in the ’ s , our cavalry all got themselves polish wives
0	they were examining large bloodstains on the back of the coat , especially down the left side
0	what have i done ?
0	her gentle eyes were dreamy and she did not look like someone waiting with apprehension for something to happen
0	he was fully conscious of this
0	i am well aware that that young gentleman is in dire straits himself and i do not consider that he owes me anything , his promises notwithstanding
0	otherwise , why did not they think of it themselves , the stupid fools !
0	what i was trying to say was that my head is there and also the head of that monster
0	tell me about last night , arkady , about that girl
0	lean close to me once again , ivan
0	but why talk about it
0	well , we ’ ll fight then , but i ’ ll love her , love her no end
0	alyosha unbound his bitten finger
0	and it was the same thing on sundays
0	he ’ s a dragon
0	and now as soon as she walked in , i knew she could not fail to attack me
0	you have no idea , mr karamazov , how nasty he is !
0	indeed , only when he heard that i was the one who had the letter did the prince really believe that there must be some truth in what he was being told—that 's how great was his trust in me !
0	i do not know that either , prince , except that it must be something awfully simple—the most common , obvious thing that we experience every day and every minute but that is so incredibly simple and natural that we have been passing it by without recognizing it for thousands of years
0	he was obviously not taken seriously , the others hardly even bothering to answer him , and this seemed to increase his irritability even further
0	he turned pale and leapt to his feet
0	i learned about it all the day before yesterday
0	for what is the purpose of this conversation between us ?
0	i am the one who will decide !
0	i ought to have called you right away and set your mind at rest once and for all
0	i wanted to talk to you about
0	they all laughed aloud
0	seeing the door open now , foma and the two women were reluctant to go into the house , for , who knows what complications it might make later
0	and do you realize that you as good as put me on the same level as stebelkov in front of your friends ?
0	i hope the soup is still hot
0	why have you come to pester me about that terrible man !
0	could you really have meant what you said ?
0	anyway , you told me yourself that she was afraid of the letter you have
0	you ’ re an ispravnik and not mr napravnik
0	isn ’ t that what happened according to you ?
0	we shall be happy , alyosha , don ’ t you think ?
0	i felt unusually confident and full of energy as if nothing had happened the previous day
0	all the boys of my age i came across were my intellectual inferiors—yes , all of them , i ca not think of a single exception
0	and to give her my regards
0	i found all sorts of people kneeling and confessing aloud
0	they have no loyalty
0	it may look as if i have written all this to defend my mother 's reputation , which may seem strange since , as i said before , i knew nothing whatsoever of her as she was then
0	well , let me assure you , i felt very healthy and pleased with life ; morally , it gave me a great boost and it was a constant secret satisfaction to me
0	for if i had , this horrible thing would probably never have happened
0	i walked all the way home , but i remember nothing of that walk
0	the whole thing had a violent effect on lisa
0	his thoughts were splintered and scattered and he realized that he was afraid to bring all the fragments together to get a total picture of all the painful and conflicting feelings he had experienced in the course of that day
0	then you will see and hear him flinch and shudder in awe : how am i to endure this mercy ?
0	i ’ d never dare try to make fun of you , sir , and , besides , i don ’ t at all feel like making fun of anyone , frightened as i am
0	at first , he wanted to complain to the school principal , but he finally decided not to allow bulkin to play with me anymore
0	don ’ t pay any attention , he ’ s nothing but an ordinary , petty devil
0	but i did manage to walk down the stairs without speeding up and , indeed , i believe i even slowed down my pace a little toward the end
0	i saw then that he understood
0	why are you so sad , mitya ?
0	many of the townsfolk tried hard to get a glimpse of the painting , but maxim ordered the servants not to let anyone in
0	he asked him severely
0	in the world you can go far under false pretenses , but lies will never bring you back to the fold
0	oh , i am not as ardent as he is ; i am calmer , but , like him , i want everybody to be good
0	a wonderful dream , the noble delusion of mankind !
0	almost ripping it off , he threw it down on the bench
0	you ’ d better wait a minute
0	i suffer , but i go on living
0	indeed , she supposedly rejected this scheme indignantly
0	so she would obviously be frightened of being left without anything and she would marry you
0	whatever happened to her was her own fault , he claimed with great assurance , and her seducer , he said , was none other than karp the wrench—a dangerous escaped convict , who at that time was living in hiding in our town
0	i have nothing to fear , smerdyakov said firmly
0	what did you mean by that ?
0	you liar , you liar !
0	give him anything he asks for or rather you know what i mean—vous comprenez , ma fille ?
0	but today at last i realized it was simply temporary insanity
0	were they written by men ?
0	what have i done to earn that distinction ?
0	actually , as became obvious later , fetyukovich had never expected much from it
0	so it was a fact that mr dmitry had been there , i thought to myself , and i decided to go through with the whole business then and there , what with gregory lying there quite unconscious so he wouldn ’ t know anything even if he did live
0	he started by explaining that his first compromising outcries had referred to gregory , because he believed he was guilty of gregory ’ s death—that , i admit , i am responsible for
0	he must be saying it out of spite , because he ’ s angry with me
0	what fool have you been talking to all this time ?
0	he described smerdyakov as a feeble-minded man with some rudiments of education , confused by certain philosophical ideas that were too much for his intelligence and frightened by some of the modern theories about the concept of duty and of one ’ s obligations , which he had had considerable opportunity to observe in his master—probably also his father—who openly led a highly irresponsible life
0	mother wept all the time and then , very gradually , so as not to alarm him , she started to beg my brother to fast and to take holy communion , for he was still on his feet
0	oh , andrei , could not we do something for her ?
0	mother cried , throwing up her hands
0	yes , i agree , it was a difficult situation to bear and it could have turned the accused into a maniac
0	and now , suddenly , a lucky breakl there was no longer any need for whispered hints , tearful nagging , gossip , and innuendoes !
0	i was already tearing downstairs and , although she was still trying to catch up with me , i managed to reach the door , run downstairs , jump out into the street , and grab the first cab i saw
0	after graduating from high school , i immediately decided to break off completely with my family and , indeed , if the circumstances required it , with the entire world , although i was not even nineteen at the time
0	he was in his fifties , had an almost stern look about him , and was a man of few words
0	he explained to the children where to put the powder charge and where to roll in the shot
0	and there was blood all over him
0	he came in yesterday
0	i don ’ t remember which part of the country that song comes from but
0	i repeat , it ’ s just a legend and i tell it to you for what it ’ s worth
0	but we will not describe the train of his thoughts , especially as the time has not come yet for us to look into his soul—we shall do that in due course
0	the prosecutor and the examining magistrate exchanged significant glances
0	and he ’ ll be enormous !
0	and if you don ’ t help me , it will be the end of everything , and first of all the end of me , for i am at the end of my tether
0	it was as though what he had experienced that day had made him understand something of the utmost importance that would stay with him for the rest of his life , something that had been quite beyond him until then
0	it was all so unsubtle and obvious that , even in the state i was in , i could not possibly fail to be aware of it
0	yes , it was me
0	and i don ’ t want to see you again , except as a last resort
0	and that ’ s why he pretended to be jealous now
0	yet it was obvious that the old man had come to love his son deeply and sincerely ; in fact , his feelings for alyosha were such as a man like him could never have expected to have for anyone
0	the pestle was in my hand
0	and when will that be ?
0	but i did count on your
0	what a character he is !
0	as you well know , it 's quite difficult to become acquainted with an englishman
0	alyosha learned with consternation that the elder was getting worse and worse
0	i realized that lambert was not in the room
0	all these people were his acquaintances and he felt just as he would have if they had all gathered on some social occasion the day before , before anything had happened
0	when questioned about smerdyakov , gregory crossed himself and said that he was an able fellow , but stupid and pestered by his sickness and , worst of all , he was a godless man , and it was mr karamazov and mr ivan who taught him his godlessness
0	but there is also a grief that bursts out , first in sobs , then in wailing—fits of wailing
0	once they have clawed at your heart , the scar will always be there
0	they ’ re on their way back from chermy and stopped here for the night
0	but what am i doing here !
0	when will it come about , if ever ?
0	and even if i do love her , what of it ?
0	is that what this creature , still only a little child , needs ?
0	he became immersed in these thoughts , forgot his prayer , and finally gave it up altogether
0	good , alexei , my dear boy , from now on let ’ s treat people like hospital patients !
0	mitya ’ s heart came almost to a standstill—three thousand
0	don ’ t you feel ashamed to be sitting here with me ?
0	just the day before it happened , vasin gave it to lisa he wanted her to keep it for him
0	she will give you that money , lambert , because i , i do not want any of it
0	yes , he ’ s certainly not worth it
0	so let ’ s say you gulped down a glass and a half of pure alcohol—that ’ s not bad , is it ?
0	whenever i realize , your reverence , that my joke isn ’ t succeeding , my cheeks begin to stick to my lower gums , like a sort of cramp
0	the moment she heard you coming she became hysterical !
0	somehow i suddenly felt terribly sorry for her
0	as long as a country is governed by a ruling caste , the nation is strong
0	all these details were a terrible shock to the impressionable lady and she kept shrieking and covering her eyes with her hands
0	the sight of an unworthy father inevitably arouses painful questions in a boy ’ s mind , especially if he compares his behavior with that of the worthy fathers of his contemporaries
0	indeed , some looked quite sad and despondent
0	there was something in katerina ’ s errand that aroused alyosha ’ s curiosity : when she had mentioned the captain ’ s young son who had run behind his humbled father crying , it had suddenly occurred to alyosha that it might be the same child who had later bitten his finger when alyosha was trying to find out how he could possibly have wronged him
0	i bet he just went to see my mother
0	miusov leaped up and rushed out of the room , followed by kalganov
0	that was how he greeted me , without even getting up
0	he is a happy man , although he has been condemned
0	ah , enough of all this nonsense !
0	alone , out of sight of anybody , deep in the woods it smells of leaves
0	he tried to reduce his brother ’ s guilt by admitting to me that he himself disliked his father and that he , too , probably wished for his death
0	his gray eyes , although not very large , were lively and bold , and constantly sparkling with feeling
0	mitya was perplexed : of course , he would have to keep watch himself now , but he wasn ’ t sure where he should post himself—right here or at samsonov ’ s gate ?
0	she is my light , the most sacred thing in my life !
0	what do i want here ?
0	why , some of those things are not even mentionable , as you know
0	yes , he did , and i immediately accepted his challenge , but i decided to send him a letter first explaining my present feelings about what had happened and my deep regrets for the stupid mistake i had made
0	he said with a poisonous smile
0	he didn ’ t make a sound
0	a merchant lived there by the name of maxim skotoboinikov and there was no one richer than him in the whole district
0	why , the new doctor said you ’ d get better
0	on a foul , damp , foggy petersburg morning , it seems to me that the imaginary world of someone like pushkin 's herman from the queen of spades ( a colossal , extraordinary , and true petersburg type ) must take an even tighter hold of him
0	he was longing to get up and announce that he would not tell them another word , even if they lead me off to be executed
0	he did go to see smerdyakov twice
0	no , i do not mean deceptively , i mean
0	i also knew that poverty represented no more than a small share of his misfortunes , a tenth or perhaps only a twentieth of them
0	then , in their pride , even these two would be unable to restrain each other and the last man would destroy the last but one , and then kill himself
0	the marquis cried in despair
0	these past few days , with the bright spring sun shining high in the sky , have kept reminding me of that other sunny morning last fall when lisa and i were walking down the street , full of joy , of hope , and of love for one another
0	oh , please , don ’ t be afraid of me—this is my very last night !
0	now , of course , i know how intelligent you are , but at first i decided you were rather simple
0	people saw the boy run down to the water , to the jetty where the ferry was tied , stretch his arms toward the water , and then stop dead , terrified
0	then they proceeded to call them back , one at a time
0	he was bordering on despair , something that had never happened to him before
0	she cried , and began to roll the cannon up and down on her knee
0	why , since smerdyakov knew these signals too , and inasmuch as you categorically deny having anything to do with the death of your father , couldn ’ t it have been smerdyakov who tapped out the agreed signal and , when your father opened the door , perpetrated the crime ?
0	lisa lowered her eyes
0	strangely enough , though , both the prosecutor and the examining magistrate now listened to him with apparent indifference , looking at him very coldly and hardly asking him any questions
0	mankind is today on the eve of its regeneration , which , in fact , has already started
0	you see , it ’ s quite possible , if i ’ m still alive or am resurrected on the day the mother embraces her child ’ s murderer , that i may join them all in their praises and shout with them , you were right ’ ; but as of now , i do not want to join them
0	oh , he felt insulted by the fact that he owed me the three thousand , because it made him realize how contemptible he was himself !
0	alyosha saw the crack and thought that lise might be watching him from her wheel-chair , but he himself could not see her
0	are we not allowed to love our country ?
0	we managed to pay one month 's rent in advance , but it was hard to stay alive
0	and yet some vague , painful , evil residue from his conversation with ivan kept stirring deep within him , striving to come to the surface
0	but this time i decided to go
0	and it is then that the sign of the son of man will appear in the heavens
0	do you call that a man ?
0	have you seen prince sergei sokolsky and darzan , gentlemen ?
0	for in the two of you , his truth will have been fulfilled
0	it 's no mere idea—it 's a passion
0	above all , he had a sound idea of how much he could get away with and when it was time to stop ; in his relations with the school authorities , he never went beyond a certain limit , after which an infraction of discipline would be considered disorder , rebellion , and lawlessness , and no longer tolerated
0	that song is already out of date , he said aloud
0	oh , i know , this is quite a reckless thing to do when it comes to his own interests , but it 's such an elegant , such a dazzling act !
0	and it was at this juncture that the accused , trying desperately to mend his fences , hurriedly told us about that little bag around his neck , as if to say : all right , then , if that ’ s how it is , i ’ ll have to tell you the whole truth now !
0	then he took his riding crop and started lashing at her bare shoulders
0	that 's not true either
0	if that were the case , he ’ d never have mentioned the secret to you , would he ?
0	as for me , i ’ ve never read the lives of the saints , nor do i intend to
0	of course , i will try to be helpful in a crisis , that is , if i can find out what to do
0	nastya interrupted him , hurriedly discarding and completely forgetting her original hypothesis
0	so why are you looking for trouble ?
0	are you calling me a puppy !
0	and ever since i can remember myself , there was always you , watching over me with kindness and love
0	as he said this , alyosha felt that he had turned very red and was furious with himself for having yielded to dmitry ’ s insistent demand that he say what he thought of katerina , and for being forced to give such stupid answers
0	but it didn ’ t last
0	by the time we graduated from the school and received our officers ’ commissions , we were prepared , at a moment ’ s notice , to shed our blood for the honor of our regiment , although hardly one of us had any idea of the true meaning of the word honor , and if any of us had known , he would have been the first to ridicule it
0	love ivan , he heard mitya ’ s voice ringing in his ears
0	and mitya sat down on the bench next to the drunk to bide his time , as he had put it
0	later , people in town were to say that it was really amazing that all these people should have been gathered by sheer chance in the police inspector ’ s house on the night of the crime
0	i repeat , it was very hard for me to follow all the developments in order , and , even today , the whole scene is still very confused in my mind
0	he had felt he had to give expression to his feelings , and he had addressed himself to rakitin
0	nevertheless , allow me to have my say , for it is possible that you may remember some of my words
0	you ’ re so slow , mother
0	i ’ m sure of it
0	the defense counsel exclaims and , without blinking an eye , goes on to conclude that christ teaches us to mete out to others as others mete out to us , and he does so from what he himself describes as a platform for justice and for sane , healthy ideas !
0	but , good god , here i ’ m keeping you out in this cold and you have no overcoat on !
0	oh , he 's a generous man and , first of all , he will restore peace to your mother 's heart because , to him , she 's the dearest creature on earth
0	this form of disavowal of your own words sounds too much like a reiteration of them , the baron growled , and i consider what you say definitely disrespectful
0	did i see a look of understanding in your eye , arkady ?
0	i can ’ t even describe it properly
0	you are not really angry with me , are you ?
0	as to the practical aspect , this plan was very much the same as the previous one ; that is , he would offer as a guarantee to transfer his rights to chermashnya to her , but , of course , he would not bring in the incentive of profit he had tried to use with samsonov the day before , for she certainly would not be interested in the possibility of getting back six or even seven thousand rubles for the three she would lend him ; no , with her , chermashnya would simply be a gentleman ’ s security for his debt
0	and she really believed it
0	everyone in town was greatly moved , all of philanthropic and pious geneva was tremendously excited
0	under us they will all be happy and they will not rise in rebellion and kill one another all the world over , as they are doing now with the freedom you gave them
0	she listened intently : the groans came again
0	to which his blessing he would give
0	the old man said , staring at alyosha
0	how can anyone ask for a requiem mass for someone who is still alive , and you , his mother of all people !
0	i had an idea now of what interested me most in this horrible mess
0	they turn into the second street , oh !
0	i was afraid to go there because even back in moscow those people frightened me
0	so go and congratulate her for me
0	he shouted at me indignantly , probably deciding i was some sort of fool
0	the same was true of some of the decisions i made then : although i was perfectly lucid when i made them , it did not bother me in the least if there was no logic whatsoever in them
0	we are asked to believe that this violent but weak man , a man who could not resist the temptation of accepting so dishonorably that three thousand rubles , would suddenly become so stoical as to carry fifteen hundred rubles around his neck without allowing himself to touch it !
0	i saw devils hiding under the cassocks of some of those monks , close to their bosoms , with just their horns showing
0	do you really sincerely believe that ?
0	i had invented him myself and now the real man could not possibly match that imaginary being
0	but this stern young woman never yielded to him completely , despite his unrestrained physical passion , so typical of a karamazov , and despite the fact that she was very much under his spell
0	ah yes , as i was telling you , that doctor , he came in connection with this temporary insanity business
0	but how can she be so sure that i will stay there ?
0	noticing right away that they were unwashed and that their shirts were dirty , she turned on gregory and slapped his face too
0	november days are short , and so it was already rather dark when alyosha rang at the prison gate
0	it never occurred to me that i would have to apologize merely for having come in his company and
0	why couldn ’ t there be among them one martyr , a man filled with great sadness and love for his fellow men ?
0	i think that would be best , although we do need money
0	then suddenly he jumped back and stood erect , facing alyosha , his whole figure striving to express his unquenchable pride
0	mitya cried in surprise
0	mitya suddenly burst into sobs and seized alyosha by the hand
0	and that was the three thousand rubles that i had in my pocket when i got to grushenka ’ s and it was that money that i spent in mokroye
0	as to this fellow , i will settle with him myself
0	that america , god damn it , i hate it already !
0	he just gave kolya another intent look
0	i think you have an exaggerated opinion of me
0	and so the obligation to accomplish something real , such as making at least one live person happy , would bring him back to his senses and reset him on his proper course
0	i don ’ t see why what i say should affect you , mr miusov
0	but alyosha suddenly realized that rakitin was looking at him mockingly and he stopped short
0	and i was terribly worried about mother
0	in that case , you could perhaps clear something up for me , since you have so much more experience than i now , suppose a lady who is just saying good-by to you suddenly says : ' i will be at such and such a place tomorrow at three
0	i ’ ve had enough of this
0	do me this favor , alexei , i beseech you
0	then nelyudov , in the presence of the witnesses , ran his fingers along the lapels , the cuffs , and all the seams of the jacket and trousers , as though looking for something—money , of course
0	now i ’ ve forgotten what i was going to say
0	it ’ s impossible to decide before the verdict is known
0	that was the topic he chose as soon as i arrived that morning
0	on that estate , beside makar there was also a girl , and she was already about eighteen when makar , who was fifty , suddenly announced his intention of marrying her
0	suddenly , and i can still see the way he looked at that moment , half smiling , he got up , hugged me hard , and kissed me
0	but now let us get down to business , gentlemen
0	i have no comment and when you read it you will know what it 's about
0	this is no blasphemy , alyosha , i assure you !
0	i ’ ll even swear to it !
0	later , however , specialists told me that it was not a sham at all , that it was a terrible female disease , particularly widespread in russia ( which shows what a hard life russian peasant women have ) , a sickness resulting from exhausting work following too soon upon a difficult , abnormal labor without medical help , and from an intensely unhappy life , full of brutality and ill-treatment , which , although common enough , is beyond the powers of endurance of some women
0	here , perezvon , lie down !
0	mitry here will be going
0	and he even imagined that i was capable of accepting his money in payment for your disgrace !
0	ah , papa , papa , papa dear ’
0	and yet , even now , as i write this , i still do not know what to call that feeling
0	and he , he had never even given him a serious thought !
0	they brought grushenka in
0	i found a second right away—a lieutenant from my regiment
0	but the most delighted of all was mrs snegirev ; she kept giggling and snapping her fingers and shouting :
0	no , i don ’ t , alyosha said
0	he did not choose to be a slave to his passion
0	but i think i know now , why
0	oh , unlike hamlet , they do not worry about the dread of something after death , as if the entire preoccupation with the soul and what will happen to it after death had long since been erased from their minds and covered over with sand
0	entering the garden , even before he caught sight of you running away from the window through which you ’ d seen your father—according to your own testimony—he glanced to his left and saw that , indeed , the window was open just as you said
0	perhaps she would just returned home from somewhere ?
0	and her you certainly have no right to judge
0	besides , he loves mother , i saw how he embraced her
0	ah , it is all still in the planning stage , i see
0	it was soon after my arrival from moscow and i would gone there on an errand for my mother
0	in other words , i ’ m willing to work if i ’ m paid for it
0	i say he 's an animal , not a man
0	i myself think my question was pretty unimportant , kolya said with a conqueror ’ s modesty
0	well , whatever it is , vodka or salami , this is great and we mustn ’ t let the opportunity slip !
0	he was still relatively young , about thirty-five , apparently had a predisposition to consumption , and was married to a very big , childless woman
0	the forged shares have been in circulation for some time now and more of them will be put on the market , even though some have already been recognized as forgeries
0	besides , you ’ ll never get there in time—the bells are ringing for late mass
0	i will win some money and pay him back today , i thought desperately
0	i certainly won ’ t tell him anything of the sort , alyosha said , smiling
0	he abused the sacrament of confession , came the accusing angry whispers of the most hardened opponents of the institution of elders , who counted among them some of the oldest monks , the strictest in their devotions , great fasters , famed for their long periods of silence , some of whom , indeed , had not spoken since long before father zosima ’ s death and who had now suddenly unsealed their lips
0	i am late with his quinine and now his temperature 's up !
0	you must really be out of your mind , prosecutor , if you think i could have gone through with that !
0	but that shouldn ’ t prevent us , the clever people , from sitting in a warm house and putting brandy to good use
0	my mother worked hard and my sister too took in sewing
0	why do you look at me like that ?
0	the room grew completely quiet
0	but until that day we must keep hope alive , and now and then a man must set an example , if only an isolated one , by trying to lift his soul out of its isolation and offering it up in an act of brotherly communion , even if he is taken for one of god ’ s fools
0	oh , i wish to god this disgraceful moment could be obliterated from my past
0	what you need is a whipping , a good whipping on your backside !
0	what about the message you ’ re supposed to be waiting for from mokroye ?
0	finally mrs khokhlakov ran out
0	and , anyway , you know enough for now
0	and now he told me that he would stolen the money that very morning out of his mother 's strong box , which he would opened with a copy of the key he would had made
0	there ’ s more to it : i know that at least five days ago he drew three thousand rubles out of the bank in hundred-ruble bills , put them in a large envelope , sealed it with five seals , and tied it up with a red ribbon
0	did you know that ?
0	but something seemed to have happened to smerdyakov
0	yesterday , in answer to katerina 's letter , he made her a formal proposal of marriage
0	my head was spinning
0	mrs prutkov fell silent
0	well , that 's just how i took much of what he said
0	probably he would intended to shoot her first and then shoot himself , but since we would interfered with his original plan , he would pointed the gun at his heart
0	mr karamazov said challengingly
0	well , the sick man suddenly regained his senses , heard the shouting , went out , and what ?
0	now that ’ s really an improper thing to say , father joseph , the monastery ’ s librarian , remarked
0	the jurists , however , were not interested in the moral aspects of the case and viewed the whole business from the point of view of the legal technicalities involved as a result of the recent judicial reforms
0	and we are great too !
0	can you forgive me—can you ?
0	this made mother very sad and was considered in the house as a great sacrifice on his part , which the collection of admiring females around him described as heroic
0	wait , lambert , it 's me who 's firing you and i may even decide to wring your neck !
0	there have been only two people who talked to me with complete seriousness before : my late husband , who was an extremely intelligent and
0	she too remained silent for a whole minute
0	do you think it would be possible for me to become better acquainted with her ?
0	maxim gave all his land and all he owned to his wife , handed her all his money and titles ; he did everything in proper legal form
0	i ’ ve come to understand my illness unerringly now
0	i was holding the money in my hand
0	she was waiting for her message at the time and , as mitya had not come over either that day or the day before , she was hoping that with luck he might not come at all before she left
0	so why must we go anywhere ?
0	she stopped for a second , looking forlorn , her eyes on mitya
0	the words katerina had spoken in alyosha ’ s presence rang in his ears—that it was he , ivan , and he alone who had convinced her that mitya was the murderer
0	but , alas , he grew so slowly !
0	all right , never mind ; if you like it , why should not you appreciate it just like any other bon mot ?
0	a woman stands for vice and seduction and a man for generosity and magnanimity
0	it was because of that letter that kraft invited me to his place after we left those people
0	i never had a friend until now , and i used to consider the notion of friendship sheer nonsense
0	and it will be weighed down by remorse and by the debt he will feel , from now on , he owes his fellow men
0	oh , if you only knew what ’ s going on between the two of them at this very moment—it ’ s heartbreaking , a terrible story , something unbelievable : they ’ re both throwing away their lives for no good reason ; they are both perfectly aware of it and actually enjoying it
0	he was very busy and appeared to be in a great hurry , but he heard and turned his head toward me
0	so as soon as i got home i would burn it over a candle , yes , absolutely over a candle
0	grushenka had become strangely thoughtful and there was suddenly a suggestion of cruelty in the curve of her lip
0	you never listened to me talk until yesterday when you noticed me using a phrase that was not to your liking
0	oh , it 's only that you use such awfully funny phrases
0	all right then , i said , slipping the letter into my pocket
0	i will remember your sorrow too and i will also pray for your husband , that the lord may grant him health and happiness
0	the baron suddenly leaped to his feet
0	she shouted , or you ’ ll get a taste of my stick !
0	if i must love my fellow man , he had better hide himself , for no sooner do i see his face than there ’ s an end to my love for him
0	the elder sat down on a leather-covered mahogany sofa of antique design , while inviting his four visitors to sit on four mahogany chairs covered with badly worn black leather ranged along the opposite wall
0	perkhotin was very surprised
0	the visitor sat there and waited , just as a parasite house guest does when he comes down from his room for tea but , seeing his host frowning and apparently preoccupied with something , waits patiently until he is addressed , always ready to start a pleasant tea-table conversation
0	he could not speak anymore ; he was gasping for breath
0	que diable , i am stupid often enough without being high-minded !
0	well , this one is really frightening , terribly cunning
0	his eyes were darting back and forth from the examining magistrate to the prosecutor
0	so , instead of going on , i just laughed
0	i know you saw her , but i know too that you did not dare talk to her
0	an evil spark appeared in smerdyakov ’ s eyes and the left one began to twitch
0	katerina ’ s beauty struck alyosha again , as it had three weeks or so before , when dmitry had brought him to introduce him to her , on her insistence that she wanted to meet his youngest brother
0	what a handshake—you almost broke my fingers !
0	alexei darzan , ippolit nashchokin , sergei hastily introduced them
0	you mean he bit your finger , snegirev said , jumping up from his chair , your finger , sir ?
0	come , act like a decent man , dmitry , do you hear me ?
0	but smerdyakov asked me not to repeat what he ’ d told me to dmitry , alyosha added
0	lean over—i want to whisper something in your ear
0	he yelled at the top of his voice
0	why , of course , it is not very easy to understand
0	we let our lads do the flogging
0	and i would have a fire going
0	somehow i only now fully grasped what he was driving at and i began to shiver all over
0	still , up to the very last moment he did not change
0	why , the one where you were yesterday
0	but when it comes to inner feelings , that ’ s quite a different matter , gentlemen , mitya said frowning , and i don ’ t really think you have the right to ask me about my feelings
0	he went in and did what he had come to do
0	but when i listened , i noticed he was talking about what he called a babe
0	the little peasant argued , begging them to wait for akim
0	but whatever it is , a pipe dream or not , i want to be allowed to die with that pipe dream
0	ask me about facts and i will answer everything to your satisfaction
0	it ’ s all nonsense really , maximov answered with obvious pleasure , although pretending to be a little coy
0	and , although certain impressions stood out , there were too many of them for any one to stand out and give meaning to the whole picture
0	i embraced mother tenderly and a ( once inquired about versilov
0	believe me , i would be only too glad to do anything i can
0	since they had already once before planned to certify him as insane , now they had even better reasons to do so , if only to prevent his marriage
0	please , we would appreciate it very much , the examining magistrate said
0	too much had already happened , and it weighed upon him
0	some of the ladies , especially the out-of-towners , appeared in the gallery in the most sumptuous attire , but most of the women gave no thought to elegance
0	i am very well aware that i behave in a reprehensible way , that i gamble , scatter money to the winds , that perhaps i am even a thief
0	now , karamazov ’ s youngest son , alexei , had been living among us for the past year and we had met him before his brothers
0	ah , hell , after almost half a year , i ’ ve suddenly managed to throw it off !
0	nevertheless we went downstairs but then , as i was about to climb into the carriage , i said to him : wait for me a minute
0	alyosha entered the house , giving his name to the parlormaid who had opened the door for him
0	on the contrary , i have only your own interest at heart and wish you good in every way
0	how did you turn that way ?
0	i would taken the plunge and started talking
0	what did he tell you ?
0	have you forgotten that peace , and even death , is more attractive to man than the freedom of choice that derives from the knowledge of good and evil ?
0	it was not to get money from her
0	come on , do not be silly
0	i also have a certain opinion of him that i must first check out
0	and you too , ivan , my respectful son , hear that i command thee to follow me from this place !
0	the girl who stood by the window suddenly cried out , looking at her father with scorn and distaste
0	and , thank god , when i myself conceived my idea , it was certainly not the worship of the golden calf , for it was obviously not really money that i was after !
0	i lay unconscious for nine days in all
0	i lied , ignoring conscience and honor , trying to save him at any cost , because he hated and despised me !
0	the walls were covered with bright blue wallpaper full of cracks , in which cockroaches swarmed in such amazing numbers that there was a continuous rustling
0	and they are also a bunch of drunkards : as soon as you pay one of them , off he goes to a tavern and he will stay there until he has drunk all his money and his clothes too and there 's not a stitch left on him and he will come out completely naked
0	well , as i said before , it is awfully difficult to express oneself in bussian : here i have filled three whole pages about resenting my name all my life and now the reader will probably conclude that what i really resent is not being prince dolgoruky but just plain dolgoruky
0	you know what , he said , it ’ s all nonsense really , a meaningless poem by a scatter-brained student who ’ s never written two lines of poetry in his life
0	and then the hope of getting the three thousand was gone , for he knew his father would never give it to him after the beating
0	nevertheless , another silence followed
0	i can not answer these questions , disturbing though they are
0	but he didn ’ t see the open door when he regained consciousness after being wounded , but before he was struck ; he saw it just after he came out of the cottage
0	get the hell out of here with your stupid big words and grand gestures !
0	what his sickness was i still can not explain very well ; some claimed that it was his heart , but then it was announced that , on his wife ’ s insistence , a group of doctors had examined him and had discovered early symptoms of mental disorder
0	ah yes , 'one ca not take offense with everybody , yes , that 's it !
0	grushenka could not finish saying what she would do ; she covered her face with a handkerchief and burst into sobs
0	the man kept starting a song , interrupting himself , swearing , and starting again in a hoarse , drunken voice :
0	although i decided not to describe anything unless it had a direct bearing on my story , i will nevertheless remark that the black coffin , which was already there , was not at all a plain one despite its color—it was upholstered with velvet—and also that the pall was of a sumptuousness not at all in keeping with the convictions or the character of the deceased
0	i have come now to sweep them out with a broom
0	he had not heard about it and asked me for more details , mainly about the time and place that the marriage had been settled
0	even the last time smerdyakov had not spoken to ivan in that tone
0	and that 's what i have been thinking all this time and that 's why i based such hopes on you
0	mother , mother , darling , stop , please stop !
0	i have come to find out how you are , i said , going straight up to makar
0	and then , quite unexpectedly , she added : but i was under the impression that you would been seeing the old prince almost every day
0	what made up for it was only my instinct , which told me that lisa was unhappy and that mother was unhappy too
0	everything else in my life became subordinated to it
0	if i had known , i would never have said all those things
0	only superior and happy natures can radiate communicative gaiety , that is , be irresistibly and cheerfully gay
0	the colonel went dashing over to trifonov ’ s , but the merchant cut him off : i never received any money from you , nor could you possibly have given me any
0	well , your sincere joy at once recaptured amy youthful heart
0	i was on the verge of fainting
0	it was soon after this had occurred to him that he met alyosha in the street
0	what strikes me now as i try to remember how he described it all to me is that he never used the word love , never spoke of falling in love
0	mitya cried , throwing up his hands
0	the tears were running down my cheeks as i wrote to her
0	and just at that second they came abreast of each other and the man , swaying from side to side , butted right into ivan
0	people weigh on me , make me feel uneasy , and uneasiness would have prevented me from achieving my goal
0	finally , unable to contain himself any longer , he bent toward his neighbor ’ s ear and said in an undertone , taunting him :
0	he said , suddenly getting up , as if remembering something very important
0	you know where we really ought to go now , alyosha ?
0	certain invisible ties must be established between the defender and the jurors during the defender ’ s speech
0	i want you to come back , ivan , do you hear !
0	yes , i did pawn my pistols to him for ten rubles , and so what ?
0	i have other things on my mind
0	i mentioned tatyana just now , but that doesn ’ t mean that i ’ m for the emancipation of women
0	as to what happened , it was simply caused by your excessive fondness for abstract discussion
0	laid low by his epileptic seizure , smerdyakov was lying immobile in his little room
0	do you know why i ’ m telling you all this , alyosha ?
0	this is how it goes
0	that one—i saw him yesterday , but i couldn ’ t find him today
0	what does it actually mean to qualify through suffering to sit in judgment of others ?
0	that 's what i wanted to ask you
0	and now miss anna and mrs akhmakov drive over to visit him every other day
0	but i thought i was being stupid
0	but later versilov had it brought to russia and i believe it may even be in petersburg now
0	he looked as if he was very irritable , as if he was always in too much of a hurry
0	i would even ask you if i could to
0	they all , except the elder , rose nervously from their seats
0	i don ’ t know in what field
0	when the young versilov was gone , i pounced upon the woman :
0	and we are no gods
0	they have science , but science contains nothing that does not come through the senses
0	it was already getting light outside
0	and you , alyosha , do you really want to leave ?
0	then i threw it down over here
0	i ’ ll be your slave now , your slave as long as i live , and i ’ ll love being your slave
0	lambert had at first convinced him to come in on the deal with him and , after he had got hold of the document , he would told him about every circumstance and every detail of the operation , including the final stratagem introduced by versilov to get mrs prutkov out of the way
0	there ’ s no way out now
0	ilya himself , his employers , and various kind-hearted townspeople , mostly local merchants , often tried to make lizaveta dress more decently
0	he was like a man in a delirium , a man not responsible for his actions
0	for one thing , if i accepted now , you would be coming and pestering me every day until the time for the appeal had passed
0	then he sees her off to her protector ’ s house , for , strangely enough , he is not jealous of samsonov—a very characteristic psychological feature of his affair
0	anyway , you often say one thing one day and just the opposite the next
0	ivan ’ s unexpected action , and his dialogue with the elder , puzzled everyone in the room , and they were all struck by his almost solemn air
0	have you brought your mattress with you , hee-hee-hee ?
0	i know you ’ ve met her
0	so i was reciting the fable to you and you were listening smilingly , but before i was halfway through , you stopped me , rang for the servant , and told him to ask mrs prutkov to come to your study
0	why did i stay and bear it all as if i would accepted to bear a cross , as if i were ready to perform a feat of heroism ?
0	the unhappy young man went home and shot himself that very night
0	perhaps the money is still there
0	why did you give me money ?
0	and , indeed , he beamed with pleasure
0	listen , alyosha , i was rude to your elder
0	no , smerdyakov ’ s faith isn ’ t russian , alyosha answered quietly and firmly
0	he looked at me with complete openness and sincerity and also with infinite warmth
0	i feel completely crushed !
0	what can i do for you ?
0	he gave one to perkhotin and handed the other to misha
0	now alyosha was almost sure that it must be the same boy , although he did not know why he was so sure
0	please do not be offended by what happened last night
0	love is gone , mitya , she began again , but what is gone is so dear to me that it hurts
0	you must know mrs salomeyev
0	he laughed , but later he wept too
0	he was devouring her with his eyes
0	they were gay , pretty girls who had recently completed their education , and although it was common knowledge in town that they would have no dowries , their grandfather ’ s house still attracted the young men of our society
0	ah , you virgin boy !
0	i ’ m sure you know exactly what the penalty is
0	you , arkady , being a young man of this generation , you are probably something of a socialist and i am sure you do not like the idea that idleness is appreciated the most among the toiling masses
0	he looked approvingly at andreyev
0	katerina suddenly cried out , her lips beginning to quiver
0	cher enfant , i heard that you were ill
0	i ’ ll teach him to laugh at me
0	and perhaps it was because all those ideas were raging within me without my even being aware of their existence that i drank , behaved wildly , and beat people up ; without knowing it , i was trying to drown out and silence those doubts
0	even as i would left her , she had still been looking at me with amazement
0	with uncalled for brusqueness , he told mitya to get into one of the carts
0	have you just come from my father 's ?
0	and , if you remember , we were told all this in a tone that brooked no dissent
0	ivan cried with a sort of childish glee , as though he had just remembered something that he had been trying hard to recall
0	it 's so strange , i ca not believe it , i ca not believe it
0	alyosha said , smiling again
0	it was pretty clear , wasn ’ t it ?
0	i would guess you were plotting to force me to marry you or something of that sort and you worked out a whole scheme with some accomplice , an old classmate of yours perhaps
0	and now , on top of all this commotion , you have to come along and worry me with that letter
0	but do not be tempted and do not try to use this ignorance as an excuse for yourself , for the eternal judge will only call you to account for what you can understand , not for what you can not , and by then you will see everything in the true light and you will not protest
0	the little goose says quack-quack-quack ,
0	mrs khokhlakov had not been feeling well for the past three weeks : her foot had somehow become swollen and , although she was not actually in bed , she had to stay home , reclining in a very attractive , albeit most decorous , déshabillé on the sofa in her boudoir
0	let me tell you of another instance that occurred only a few days ago
0	i had to take her to the monastery that day and have the holy fathers lecture her on meekness and calm her down
0	i was thinking of mother and how i had not spoken to her just now
0	although a widower , the inspector led the life of a family man ; his house was run by his widowed daughter , herself the mother of two grown-up daughters , makarov ’ s granddaughters
0	is that the way to unite them ?
0	i am sure you understand
0	there was a hint of cruelty in her slightly twisted smile
0	but i was driven by an uncontrolled curiosity , a strange fear , and some other feeling that i can not define
0	kolya was standing by ilyusha ’ s bed
0	you know , when i told him that i refused to remain silent , he tried to switch the conversation to geological upheavals and all that sort of nonsense !
0	i will deal with these questions later because my primary concern now is to discuss the possibility of attaining my objective
0	if you were not my son , i ’ d challenge you to a duel this very second—pistols
0	he sat down again , looking around him now and then as if expecting to find something
0	besides , your answer was bound to reflect your democratic position
0	alyosha soon emerged from the house and went quickly up to kolya
0	this was all perfectly true
0	the main topic of our conversation was the socialist revolutionaries who , incidentally , were at that time being persecuted
0	the boys picked up the coffin , and when they lowered it beside nina , she kissed her brother ’ s lips for the last time
0	mitya muttered , somewhat put off by the admonition
0	you made me recite the fussy maid all over again and this time i got all the way to the end and finished with a flourish that made even mrs prutkov smile at me while you yourself went as far as to shout 'bravo , bravo !
0	he was not distrustful , however , or shy and unsociable , just the opposite , in fact
0	sincere laughter free of malice denotes gaiety , and how many people are there who know how to be gay in this century of ours ?
0	and on top of that , he must have fully understood now how shabbily he had behaved toward lisa , and all to no avail
0	but you must admit it 's not fair—you bought it for two and sold it for ten
0	you were talking about some wouldepressing connections '
0	perhaps it contained pepper as well ?
0	you agree too , don ’ t you ?
0	i want to know the truth
0	but that is the reasoning of another world and it ’ s incomprehensible to the human heart here on earth
0	but there was a bright and glittering spot in the center of my field of vision that prevented me from focusing on many things that passed right before my eyes : i lightheartedly refused to take in anything that was gloomy and threatening , being interested only in that bright spot
0	they start with the most ridiculously trivial things , but in the end they conquer their will and thus gain their freedom
0	she knit her brows and her face reddened darkly
0	i am so glad you did come in the end !
0	and tell them to prepare champagne for him , three dozen bottles , say , and have them pack it just the way they did the time i went to mokroye
0	oh , good lord , alexei , i ’ m getting all mixed up
0	and now he still needs a hat
0	of course , of course , but those are just commonplaces
0	just the fact that he keeps company with you says enough !
0	we have corrected your work and have now founded it on miracle , mystery , and authority
0	yes , i ’ m sure it ’ s his doing , mitya said , frowning
0	the latter two had also appeared as ordinary witnesses for the prosecution
0	and she no longer loves dmitry
0	still , at certain quiet moments , he would think about his soul , sigh , and worry a great deal about life beyond the grave
0	soon they let him into the room and i sat down on vasin 's sofa to try to eavesdrop , but i could not make out what they were saying , except that versilov 's name kept coming up again and again
0	he was in the garden , we are told , hence he is the murderer
0	a tramp in the best sense
0	i have money too and my money is better than his
0	ivan shouted , staring into the bailiff ’ s face , and all of a sudden he seized the man by the shoulders and , full of rage , hurled him to the floor
0	i am so glad you came , kraft said
0	katerina seemed very pleased to see alyosha
0	this is what i have come here for , to throw myself at your feet and ask you
0	but then something very annoying and unpleasant happened in the house , making mr karamazov terribly anxious and distraught
0	true wit is becoming extinct , it 's becoming rarer and rarer
0	but kolya himself was anxious to keep his distance from the teacher ; he always did his homework well , was second in his class , and treated dardanelov coldly ; many boys were still convinced that he was good enough in world history to show up dardanelov himself
0	so who do you think is the murderer ?
0	the arresting police officer was accusing me of assaulting a colonel
0	i have described all this in the hope that you would notice a fact that i consider extremely revealing
0	may turn out to be quite unfounded
0	i take my hat off to him !
0	first , we have before us a poor little boy , abandoned in the backyard , without shoes , as we were told by a shocked witness , a highly esteemed townsman of ours , a man , alas , of foreign extraction
0	well , let the son face his father and ask him : tell me , why should i love you ?
0	but dmitry lived far away and very likely was not even at home now
0	for , indeed , they have been prepared in their quiet retreat for an hour and a day , a month and a year
0	samsonov was a sick man and during the past year he had lost the use of his swollen legs
0	indeed , he has already wasted a good thousand rubles on the beauty , and that ’ s why he keeps borrowing money
0	still , he greeted me warmly , but when i started asking him questions he answered with obvious reluctance and also seemed to find it difficult to keep his mind on what he was saying
0	three fresh horses were being led through the open gates
0	besides , it will be your birthday
0	but all these thoughts just flashed through my mind because there was something real that was making my heart pound , something that i could not define
0	ah , le petit vilain !
0	it was true , of course , that i had been worrying about that letter and had felt the need for an impartial opinion , but i admit that i already felt i could cope with the dilemma without any outside help
0	rakitin had so worked himself up that he could hardly control himself
0	and in the name of what did she do it ?
0	i am outraged by you , holy fathers !
0	i turned the key and suddenly there was the blackness of the night stretching in front of me , boundless , dangerous , and unknown
0	before going any deeper into my petersburg story with all the events in which i am to play a disgraceful part , i consider this preliminary explanation quite indispensable
0	but ivan is silent as the grave
0	i expected he ’ d kill old mr karamazov
0	it was settled without you , for how could old mitya karamazov turn down an offer to escape ?
0	she suddenly leaned toward me and lowered her voice as if the answer to that question had been the main object of her visit
0	they ’ ll have smoked salmon too , the expert on troy put in unexpectedly in a loud voice
0	i understand your whole class visits him now ?
0	indeed , i was glad whenever i could distract him and cheer him up
0	so i took the prescription and put it on the shelf where the icons are and just left it lying there
0	i ’ m leaving you with a clear conscience
0	and that 's why they all joked and laughed that day
0	that ’ s what the prosecutor was referring to , i know , because i heard him talking about it last week
0	no , i suppose that 's impossible
0	i still ca not make out to this day exactly what sort of man he is
0	you know , i do not at all understand why your sister should love me , but i can tell you that , if it had not been for her , i probably would not even be alive today
0	he spoke resolutely with an overtone of impatience , which he apparently did not try to conceal—indeed , perhaps he wanted the others to understand that he didn ’ t really mean what he was saying and was being derisive
0	smurov said , stopping suddenly
0	[ ] a single line , but a classic !
0	a lofty ideal is mostly a feeling that sometimes remains undefined for a very , very long time
0	lately i would been to see anna rather often
0	some doctor over there in america will graft a wart or something onto my face , for they ’ re great technicians , those americans , after all
0	his wild yell resounded from the street
0	i believe it was because at that point we both felt there were many things we should explain to each other
0	well , i say to her , that depends on people ’ s taste and , as to you , i say , you aren ’ t big , but you stink
0	but i must be on my way
0	( alyosha later remembered himself that on that terrible day he forgot completely about his brother dmitry , although earlier he had been so worried about him ; he also forgot to take the two hundred rubles back to ilyusha ’ s father , although he had been so anxious to do so the day before )
0	besides , the word contemporary ’ would have reminded saltykov-shchedrin of his magazine the contemporary , a rather painful reminder in view of the difficulties they are having with our present censors
0	i must emphasize here that this was the very first meeting of the karamazovs , the first time that some members of that strange family had set eyes on each other
0	there is nothing hidden that shall not become manifest
0	suddenly ivan began to laugh and stood up , hat in hand
0	he ’ s very sick too , lise
0	and , besides , that way you have not had to suffer the humiliation of rejection
0	i would made up my mind and i went directly to see mrs prutkov
0	everything will pass and the truth alone will remain
0	but he had hardly uttered the words before mitya was on top of him
0	she had obviously enjoyed the story and versilov 's way of telling it , although she would kept darting worried looks at lisa
0	kolya suddenly straightened up and faced alyosha , as though ready to fight him
0	as long as this notion is kept alive in a few minds , there 's still hope for its realization : it 's like a bright spot glowing in the dark
0	as god is my witness , i trust you implicitly where lise is concerned and i don ’ t even mind that she asked you to come in secret from her mother
0	it was the person who opened the door to the house who killed and robbed my father !
0	you ’ re quite a business woman yourself , he told her , giving her eight thousand rubles or so , so why don ’ t you operate with it on your own
0	that time , however , it never got him anywhere
0	and on top of that , she told me , if you sue him , i won ’ t have anything to do with you and you ’ ll never earn one kopek from me , and my merchant will kick you out
0	that ’ s where all the boys leave their coats ; otherwise it gets too cluttered in the room
0	there was cold contempt and a note of anger in his voice
0	i don ’ t know why
0	even before anything 'sinful ' had taken place , i explained the situation to makar with the most extraordinary bluntness
0	she gave her an address , somewhere near the voznesensky bridge—the street , the house , the number of the apartment—and left
0	that ’ s the way it always is with god ’ s fools : they ’ re liable to cross themselves at the sight of a tavern and then hurl stones at a church
0	once he had decided , alyosha would have félt it strange , even impossible , to go on living as he had been
0	it would seem that a man with a powerful constitution like his should have been able to weather a night of drinking , even one full of violent emotions
0	but i must say i didn ’ t anticipate anything of this sort , although i knew the man with whom i came here
0	that mr napravnik i was referring to is one of the greatest russian conductors , and it ’ s a sort of conductor that we need for the harmony of our little enterprise
0	this last remark slipped from my lips inadvertently as i stared at his shining eyes and his face , which had grown even paler
0	alyosha ’ s great merit in this matter lay precisely in the way he had succeeded in tactfully reconciling each boy in turn with ilyusha , as though by chance , and without any slobbery sentimentality
0	but i ’ ll leave this town soon enough and may be gone for a very long time
0	do not you recognize it ?
0	i inquired to get some idea
0	come back soon , very soon
0	miusov , however , did not find it necessary to answer father paisii ’ s pressing and almost angry question
0	i am sure they are aware of it , but they wo not let on and continue to forge ahead queen-like , without turning their heads
0	much as i may want to , i can do nothing about it
0	and , mind you , there are no exceptions
0	mitya shouted in despair
0	that 's her , all right
0	just that : whether you wanted your father murdered or not
0	ivan gave him a long , long look
0	he also wanted me to tell you something else , alyosha said , his voice quivering
0	how can you say things like that ?
0	ivan stared at him and suddenly began to shake in convulsive terror
0	nevertheless i sat and waited
0	it was because of her that he made that disgraceful scene in the elder ’ s cell—just because miusov referred to her as a creature ’ or something
0	in my opinion , christ ’ s love for human beings was an impossible miracle on earth
0	did he seem sincere or was he putting on an act ?
0	i gave him my word and i must keep it
0	if he had said one word then , perhaps i would have pulled myself together , although perhaps not
0	that night i hated her : first with a raving madman 's hatred , then with that of a disgusting sensuous drunkard
0	but since he was in town , she had asked him to examine ilyusha as well and had notified snegirev in advance
0	you look at me so gently , and you do not even consider me worthy of your anger ?
0	he impressed general akhmakov greatly
0	and this time she has put her full trust in him in the hope of getting rid of him once and for all
0	was it a real epileptic fit or were you shamming it ?
0	at that moment my sister came in and i turned to her at once
0	who are you going to complain to ?
0	he laughed and said , yes , it ’ s very good , and left
0	or perhaps i would better just get out of this dump
0	nor has he ever said a word about marrying mother
0	he stared at kolya
0	the old woman uncorked it without cooling it
0	well , if that ’ s how it is , i won ’ t drink either , grushenka said
0	his name is karamazov , mother , the captain corrected her
0	or do you imagine that there ’ s some kind of deal between us and that i ’ m afraid you may talk ?
0	don ’ t worry , we ’ ll do something about that
0	and so , as long as i was in her presence , i did not dare to contradict her
0	he asked in a loud voice
0	as if you really believed that !
0	what will i do with my wife and my family ?
0	i ’ ll save you just as i saved my cousin belmesov
0	on holy thursday , we have something cooked without oil and drink wine with some dry food , because the laodicean council says of holy thursday : it is wrong to break your fast on the thursday of the last week of lent and thus dishonor the whole of lent
0	the landlord paused and looked at us each in turn with delight
0	she 's got hold of you to find out certain things from you , lisa told me in angry whispers with an expression such as i would never seen on her face before
0	all i know is that the idea sprouted in the brain of the old prince nikolai sokolsky , who is sick now , but i have had no part in it and have never spoken of it to anyone
0	now , however , i have changed my views on that particular point and i no longer believe that education would spoil anything
0	everything will be amply explained in its proper place because this was my purpose in writing it all down in the first place
0	from the exchanges between the two of them and from lisa 's expression , i gathered that lisa was extremely tense , that she spent most of her days away somewhere attending to matters that concerned her personally
0	the study was a large , high-ceilinged room , cluttered with all sorts of furniture
0	you ought to be the last one , my young friend , she went on , looking at the doctor , to talk such utter nonsense because you have known me ever since you were a ten-year-old boy and so i would like you to tell me when was the last time you saw me idle
0	grushenka , letting out peals of laughter , ran from the room
0	she gives him that strong stuff perhaps three times a year or so , when he gets those pains around the waist and then gets like paralyzed from the waist down , which happens to him , as i said , about three times a year
0	snegirev muttered , staring strangely and wildly straight into alyosha ’ s eyes with the look of a man who has suddenly decided to jump off a mountain peak , while at the same time he forced his lips into a smile , i , sir
0	he lowered his eyes , still grinning
0	what exasperated her most was that he still never departed from his calm tone and there was no trace of indignation in what he said about sergei : he simply reasoned logically and arrived at the conclusion that lisa 's hero was worthless , and it was his logical detachment that made his irony so exasperating
0	i said good-by to them and left
0	as i understand it , in olden times there were probably elders in russia too , but as the country went through a series of calamities—the tartar invasion , civil wars , and isolation from the orthodox east after the fall of constantinople—the institution fell into disuse and the elders vanished from our monasteries
0	no , wait , here ’ s smaragdov ’ s universal history
0	the man rushed toward the fence
0	and it was that idiot maria who sewed it in for you !
0	sit down , for heaven ’ s sake , grushenka snapped at him impatiently
0	are you addressing me , sir ?
0	i toss the document on the table and say with infinite scorn : no need for all that—there 's nothing i want from you
0	we must sniff at each other first , he explained
0	i also want you to know , arkady , that when she came to me the last time , i admitted that i had deceived her and that i had gone to anna with the intention of proposing to her
0	ah , i ca not make it look decent !
0	he ’ s killed gregory , he says
0	well , after all that happened and all you said about versilov— that he 's not honorable , among other things—and also your general tone all this time in short , i ca not accept this money from you
0	but god torments me
0	the truth is there and that 's where i must pursue it !
0	he was a conscientious physician , a kindly , pious man , a member either of the herrnhuter society or the moravian brethren , i ’ m not sure which
0	i wish i ’ d warned her i ’ d be late
0	mother said , for she would become very frightened when versilov had whispered in my ear
0	that 's not true : alphonsine is a spy and lambert is a spy , and maybe you are a spy too !
0	all that , i had never imagined
0	there are women here right now , sir—peasant women , the monk replied
0	alyosha ran over to the fence
0	the only thing i will say is that it is an original concept , which sets you apart from most of the young people of your generation who , instead of thinking for themselves , pounce upon any available ready-made notions
0	maximov was smiling again
0	i realized all this in one of those flashes of complete lucidity that often come over people who are slipping into a completely drunken oblivion but who have not quite reached it
0	the room was almost completely dark now
0	alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that , despite her injured foot , mrs khokhlakov was more careful than ever about what she wore , that she favored all sorts of new topknots , ribbons , and loose wrappers , and he had a pretty good explanation for this , although he dismissed such thoughts from his mind as frivolous
0	sergei gave him versilov 's address and on the following day a letter of apology addressed to me arrived along with some thirteen hundred rubles that i had left at the roulette table
0	i was ashamed to be with you , the cringing way you apologized to those poles !
0	between his fingers were dangling four red ten-ruble bills
0	i ’ m sure he ’ ll be very glad to see you
0	the devil 's song is long , persistent
0	even his face is completely different
0	at the beginning of the changes introduced by peter the great , my greatgrandfather—also a peter—remained an old believer and went off to live in the kostroma forests
0	it was beginning to grow dark and the light in the room came from the lamps and wax candles burning before the icons
0	but tell me honestly—aren ’ t you yourself a little ashamed to be with me ?
0	he must have been an important visitor as he was wearing all sorts of distinguished decorations and a family crest
0	here , this glass here
0	i ’ d greatly appreciate it , kartashov , if you ’ d spare us your asinine remarks when no one has asked for your opinion or , for that matter , is even aware that you exist !
0	and that 's exactly what i did
0	but you are looking exactly the same way
0	alyosha just managed to ward it off by raising his arm , and the stone hit his elbow
0	then he let out a long , arrogant , spiteful chuckle and , with a challenging glare in his eyes , shouted :
0	i hate myself so for not having come much sooner , kolya said , no longer ashamed of his tears
0	but these efforts lead not to a full life but to suicide , because , instead of realizing his personality , man only slips into total isolation
0	it 's at home with alphonsine
0	i ’ m pretty used to handling money and can tell !
0	no , it was not me
0	yes , this is what his heart will cry out
0	you went to see her
0	well , i ca not remember everything he said , but i could not hold back my tears the moment i noticed that olga 's lips were trembling from gratitude too
0	a minute white rash appeared on the little girl 's tongue , lips , and all around her mouth , and toward evening she died , with her dark eyes fixed on me as though she knew what was happening to her
0	soon , however , i noticed with considerable surprise that everywhere we went everybody knew her and treated her with great respect
0	but , again , what could i do ?
0	that would be the end of my torments
0	some may say that he feigned the fit precisely to avoid being suspected of the murder himself , having told the accused about the money and the signals to lure him to come and kill fyodor karamazov and hoping to beat him to the money
0	the coffin was no longer there and he wore the clothes he had worn on the night when they had all gathered in his room
0	ah , now i can see through you once and for all !
0	the day before abbe rigaud had come to lecture him about his behavior : he walked into the room , planted himself in front of lambert , and proceeded to whimper , throwing his arms in the air , making all sorts of disgusted faces , and reproaching him for his ways
0	the nonentity shouted in a tone of triumphant viciousness
0	and the most important fact is that , although until the last moment he didn ’ t know he would trample those bills underfoot , he certainly had a foreboding of it
0	how long do you expect me to wait for you to take it ?
0	yes , his own son , he repeated , dragging me toward the ladies without any further explanations
0	well , that letter , written by the person who made the will , can be interpreted in a sense contrary to the decision of the court
0	no , she never was
0	we forgot the bread !
0	was i really incapable of making a decision ?
0	and how do you know that it was the letter i wrote to andronikov ?
0	once you have chosen your elder , you renounce your own will , you yield it to him in total submission and self-renunciation
0	i can tell you nothing more on the subject
0	mr andronikov , who was looking out for versilov 's interests , had this letter in his possession and shortly before his death he gave it to me and asked me to put it into a safe place
0	i grabbed that pestle for the purpose of killing my father , fyodor pavlovich karamazov , by smashing his head with it
0	it may , of course , seem a strange decision—for a young man to go so late at night , at almost eleven o ’ clock , to the house of a society lady to whom he had not even been introduced , to possibly rouse her out of bed , and then ask her a question that would sound quite strange under the circumstances
0	balaam ’ s ass broods in silence and then , all of a sudden , he comes out with god knows what
0	no one else will tell it to me
0	my able colleague , the talented examining magistrate nelyudov , told me later that , at that moment , he felt so immensely sorry for karamazov that he was almost moved to tears
0	' i am sure there will be no problem because i know many people in petersburg , and some of them are even quite influential
0	no , not the beatings
0	the entrance was from the yard and it led into a passage
0	of course , his assurance was quite unfounded and irresponsible , but it was because of this thoughtlessness and irresponsibility that he felt sure his father would pay him the money and then he would be able to refund the sum to miss verkhovtsev by mailing the three thousand rubles to her relatives
0	he blessed all the women and bowed low to them
0	in fact , he was screaming at me today
0	a man may seem quite inscrutable , but if he bursts into sincere laughter , you will see his whole character as though you were holding it in the palm of your hand
0	they ’ ve also brought in a doctor to try and prove i ’ m mad
0	do you remember his starting off by saying that everybody is just like the late fyodor karamazov ?
0	he thinks a bit much of himself , though , and i said to him today : you can ’ t despise the karamazovs , because they ’ re philosophers rather than scoundrels , just like all real russian people
0	i wonder whether you could spare me a clean piece of rag or something to bind my finger , alyosha interrupted her suddenly
0	even though i was caught in a whirlpool and had no one to turn to for guidance and advice , i was fully conscious of my downfall and therefore can not be excused
0	sofia was the daughter of an obscure deacon
0	i think he was just pulling my leg !
0	beggars surrounded our visitors as soon as they appeared , but nobody gave them anything , except for young kalganov who dug a ten-kopek piece out of his purse and , for some reason looking very embarrassed , pushed it hurriedly into one woman ’ s hand , muttering something like to share among you
0	that has nothing to do with it
0	it is true there was nothing particularly morally reprehensible about the things kolya did , but there was something surprisingly wild and reckless in his behavior
0	i thought before that i ’ d sing that hymn , but i see now that i can ’ t even get over being pushed around by the guards
0	besides , the assumption that the witness lied under oath in her first testimony creates a serious possibility that she lied under oath again in her second testimony
0	then i turned my back on him and tossed my pistol far away , shouting : begone , i have no further need of you !
0	o divine and saintly elder !
0	but ivan is no rakitin
0	tatyana prutkov had suddenly appeared in the doorway , looking very pleased with herself
0	everything turned bright the moment you came in
0	i admit , it was stupid of me
0	the problem facing us now can only be missed by those who are blind
0	but that ’ s just it—i can not make up my mind to do it , although every day i think to myself , go on , do it , you scoundrel !
0	i can see that you are in love up to your gills with katerina yourself !
0	he understood nothing of what the presiding judge told him in admonition upon releasing him
0	ilyusha raised himself and looked admiringly at the toy with his arm still around perezvon ’ s neck
0	in truth , i am a living lie , the father of lies
0	even after he would enlarged his circle of acquaintances considerably , nothing important came lambert 's way
0	there are , makar , versilov suddenly said , there are and 'there should be
0	above all , i want every little detail
0	i can simply smell some low scheme on your part
0	my constant losing humiliated me , made me feel ashamed before sergei , before versilov ( although versilov never deigned to talk about it ) , before everyone , even that woman tatyana prutkov !
0	but only yesterday i could not believe that one day i would be sitting and talking with my own son
0	so you told them every word that we said during our talk by the gate ?
0	flashed through miusov ’ s head
0	assuming , of course , that you were not raving when you made that confession
0	however , it was obvious to me that his gaiety , enthusiastic as it may have been , was very brittle and could at any moment turn into complete despondency
0	she had lost her husband when she was only eighteen , after only a year or so of marriage and soon after bearing him a son
0	this was a perfectly well-established fact , for there had always been many candidates for those favors , particularly in the past year or two
0	ah , yes , of course , i believe you fell into the snow
0	but over me , when i die , they ’ ll just reel off the little canticle what earthly joy
0	people shout to the weeping mother
0	i am quite aware that one is likely to come across plain thieves at the gaming tables , not just common pickpockets from the street but quite well-known gamblers
0	and so it 's really hard to say which of them made the other more miserable
0	why do you feel you always have to talk to me like that ?
0	after that i did not look at her again and rushed out in a great hurry
0	now mr karamazov ’ s voice became peevish and irritated
0	i will never forget the eager , albeit unemotional and detached , interest with which she heard me out , nor the self-assured expression she had during all that time
0	but i think i ’ d better stop there , because you look as if you were about to attack me
0	i spoke about something quite irrelevant , but i believe i was expressing myself quite articulately now
0	but i still think that a man who wants to preach honor should be honorable himself
0	it ’ s true , alyosha , it was the money that i was smiting with my fist !
0	perhaps he ’ s putting all these ideas into mitya ’ s head—do you think so ?
0	and of whom is he jealous ?
0	facing the icons was a little lamp that was lighted on every holiday
0	she has spared me
0	then , supporting me just as he was now , lambert had led me to a cab , eagerly listening to every word i had babbled
0	but i don ’ t know you at all , alyosha insisted
0	i shouted in indignation , for it might have looked as if i had lifted the cover to allow darzan to install himself in the sledge , as though i were his flunkey !
0	at first , he seemed to skip from one subject to another , as though stumbling on topics at random , without any system
0	she must be in there !
0	but their devilish reckoning was based on the knowledge that , in this particular case , the husband would react in the same way whether presented with evidence or not
0	tell me also , do you ever think about that darkness ?
0	i am sure , for instance , that aferdov , who is well known in all the gambling clubs , is a thief
0	now look at that !
0	it would take three big volumes to write it all down , and even then you ’ d still have to add an epilogue to it !
0	but tell me this : you were just talking about tatyana
0	he searched in his briefcase , pulled out a letter , and handed it to me
0	if it has that thing written on it
0	love the animals : god has given them the beginnings of thought and untroubled joy
0	i have come to look at you and to listen to you for a few minutes
0	don ’ t you have anything smaller ?
0	on the contrary , they all looked very grave
0	flung his arms round me , trying to pull me away , shouting at my assailant , let go of him , he ’ s my papa , please let him go , forgive him !
0	why are we all sitting here like this ?
0	of course , i realized i would lose everything , for she would run away , but it would have been an infernally clever revenge that would have been worth all the rest
0	i was ready to rush in at the first sign of danger
0	ah , never mind about that now
0	i ’ m not too good at explaining all these subtleties , but one thing i ’ m sure of—a thief is viler than an ordinary vile scoundrel
0	there was also great curiosity about katerina ’ s rival , grushenka
0	that occurred to me just then , but i was already so excited and eager to do it that it took my breath away
0	unlike his brothers , one of whom represents the western ’ and the other the russian national ’ principle , dmitry karamazov represents russia directly , as it is today , although he certainly does not represent all of modern russia—god forbid that he should !
0	they brought the boy out of the guardroom
0	for the first time since my arrival i had money in my pocket ( as i mentioned before , i would given my mother the sixty rubles representing my two years ' savings )
0	you weren ’ t afraid to arouse suspicion then , were you ?
0	may the lord bless you , both you and baby lizaveta
0	and although she lived in the same house and on the same floor as the fanariotovs , she had her own private two-room suite so that during all the time i would spent there , i would never met any of the fanariotovs
0	in the first place he had discarded his cassock and now wore instead a very nicely cut jacket and a round felt hat
0	neither alyosha nor ivan had wanted to live in their father ’ s house , which now stood empty , and each had his own lodgings
0	unless you ’ re planning to help things happen yourself that way
0	and just when lisa was saying all those things about vasin !
0	but anyway i ’ ve already told you i ’ m waiting for a certain message and , as soon as it arrives , i ’ ll have to fly off somewhere , and i mean fly off—you ’ ll see me vanish
0	the rest of them are doomed to go through dreadful ordeals before they gain the kingdom of god
0	and never again would that phantom come back to haunt her !
0	the prior and father paisii tried hard to calm the fidgety crowds
0	and he told me about money : he says there ’ ll be ten thousand to pay for my escape and another twenty thousand to start me off in america
0	gentlemen , give me a chance to tell you everything myself and do not interrupt me to ask irrelevant questions , mitya said excitedly
0	and i ’ m sure rakitin will make a career too
0	let me repeat : it was not stupidity , for most such eccentrics are really quite intelligent and cunning , and their lack of common sense is of a special kind , a national variety
0	i cried , glancing by chance at the clock on the wall
0	to tell you the truth , i didn ’ t expect to see you here , for i never thought you ’ d be willing to come
0	i no longer understand anything , anna
0	oh , never mind , it is still very far to that corner where they will turn into the second street , and , reassured by this thought , the condemned man looks cheerfully to his right and to his left , at all those thousands of curious people who are so unconcerned with what is about to happen to him , and under their fixed stares , he still has the delusion that he is one of them , just another human being
0	but soon the time came for him to start on one of his drinking bouts and he went at it for three weeks without letup
0	and finally , in the state he was in , the elder could not possibly have carried on such a long monologue , for he breathed with difficulty , his voice faltered , and he even had to lie down and rest several times , although he never actually went to sleep and his guests never left their seats
0	but since i do not have those skills , how can i hold forth before others , ignorant as i am ?
0	there 's something i would like to tell you
0	the boys , however , remained convinced that dardanelov simply did not know who the founder of troy was
0	and they were asleep
0	that inheritance is not enough
0	the hell with it !
0	but , all right , i ’ ll tell you if you wish
0	certainly , the prosecutor said , although his answer was rather cool compared with the examining magistrate ’ s enthusiasm
0	at long last mrs prutkov was at home
0	doctor , doctor , sir , is it possible ?
0	her nose was very straight , regular , and just the right length
0	however , because he had allowed himself to show his joy sincerely , he felt insulted
0	because all that has vanished , everything is different , and because i want nothing to do with the man who was plotting against you
0	you know , my boy , i said that judging from myself
0	perkhotin was met with the stunning news that fyodor karamazov had really been murdered and robbed that night in his house
0	but that ’ s nothing compared with your own fasting , reverend father , the visiting monk added in a bolder tone , for you live on nothing but bread and water throughout the whole year , even during easter , and the bread we eat in two days lasts you a whole week
0	as i spoke , i felt i was falling into a void
0	i ’ m sure when you kept nagging me , bring him here , rakitin , just get him here , i ’ m sure you had something in mind
0	then she quickly walked toward the door
0	but the worst of it is that many of our russian criminal cases indicate a certain state of mind in our society , a sort of general calamity that has taken root among us and that we find more and more difficult to resist as it becomes an omnipresent evil
0	how was it , how did you put it ?
0	and it was because of that that it seized me
0	as the hour drew close , kolya lay down between the rails
0	when the prince came back , he passed by me without looking at me , went over to his desk , and suddenly observed :
0	i don ’ t kiss mother earth , i don ’ t plow her soil
0	but you have already started , she said , failing to suppress her smile
0	and you , rakitin , i was about to apologize to you for having insulted you the way i did , but now i don ’ t feel like doing so
0	and he convinced me that he ’ d pull it off all right ; every day he told me about the progress he was making
0	do you mean roulette ?
0	is that how strongly you believed in god ?
0	sergei asked nashchokin , peculiarly emphasizing the question
0	you ’ re really slow in understanding , fellow !
0	but , in appreciation of your frankness , i will tell you just as candidly what i have decided to do
0	i ’ m so happy , alexei !
0	and now i have woken up and the man i love is still here with me
0	we ’ ll continue with it in town and , as far as i am concerned , i ’ m prepared to wish you the best of luck
0	it so happened that touchard and his wife went out somewhere for the day and i was all alone with agafia
0	we were taught that by the tartars , who left us the whip to remember them by
0	the monk asked , becoming bolder and bolder
0	what chance have we to find it on the floor ?
0	he tore off his shirt impatiently
0	but never mind , bottoms up !
0	i thought as i was still holding onto her and swaying to and fro
0	you ’ re right , and if you come here often enough , you ’ ll find out what a wonderful person she is
0	and what do i care about lisa ?
0	will you be so cynical as to accept it ?
0	smurov fell silent too
0	she rushed toward me , for i believe i started shivering violently or perhaps i even fainted
0	he inquired with sympathy
0	he picked it up from the table and handed it to me
0	besides , it was some sort of holiday , so i was sure he would be back soon
0	and don ’ t feel embarrassed when you eat those pancakes
0	can it be the revulsion i feel for father ’ s house ?
0	i don ’ t remember where my brother was that day , but there were only the two of us—my mother and i it was a bright , sunny day and i remember clearly the incense rising from the censer and wafting slowly upward , while from a little window in the cupola sunbeams streamed down into the church , and it looked as if the incense , rising in waves , was melting in the sunlight
0	he had to know at once
0	for now , i tried to soften the blow for sergei
0	that still doesn ’ t convince me that you were wide awake , fetyukovich snapped sarcastically , and there was more subdued laughter
0	i gave him one of those scornful looks as if to say , here , go on , take another stab at me if you like , since that ’ s your way of showing your appreciation for all i ’ ve done for you
0	suppose you decided to fire this bullet into your brain , wouldn ’ t you have a good look at it first while loading your gun ?
0	otherwise , why should i have dreamt about that babe ’ at such a moment ?
0	my head ached , my temples throbbed , my heart was pounding
0	but now he no longer cared
0	and , for god 's sake , do not bring your brother to me
0	alyosha looked at her intently
0	otherwise , of course , they were all dr herzenstube ’ s regular patients
0	i sat down across the table from him and i had the feeling that i was the incarnation of fever and delirium facing him , the incarnation of the golden mean and common sense
0	that ’ s right , sir , it had pepper in it too
0	i will go to her , throw myself at her feet , and say to her : you were right when you passed me by
0	he could just have come to , as patients afflicted with the falling sickness usually do
0	it would be all right , he said , if you believed in virtue at least , and said : let them not believe me , i must still tell them as a matter of principle !
0	what i am after is something that can be acquired through power and only through power : that is self-sufficiency and a calm awareness of my strength
0	alyosha did not want to call him or try to catch him , for he knew it would be to no avail
0	now you ’ re going a bit far , lise !
0	the purpose was to find out how the trial would have come out if contemporary laws had been applied and if modern court procedures , with defense counsels , prosecutors , et al , had been followed
0	that ’ s just the trouble , it ’ s all too real
0	and she was not putting this on
0	it would have been better if you would strangled me at birth
0	how can i tell you that you don ’ t know what exaltation is ?
0	but at that second , lisa pushed me behind a curtain and we found ourselves in a little space by a bay window
0	i see that you ’ re interested in such worldly questions
0	ilyusha hugged the dog hard , stretched himself out , and buried his face in the shaggy fur
0	versilov will kill her !
0	no one had suggested i do so
0	i offered him three thousand rubles
0	and it 's time you learned to pack your things yourself ; you ca not expect always to have someone waiting on you
0	i kept it for three days , but grew too ashamed of myself , gave the coin back , and admitted what i ’ d done
0	she quite surprised me
0	however , i have no right to judge anyone
0	that means he ’ ll be ferocious and you ’ ll have to keep him chained , kolya commented expertly , as if he had come especially to examine the pup and its black nose , although in fact he was still trying to overcome the alarming feeling inside him that he might suddenly begin to cry like one of those little boys
0	we would have become very close friends if he had spoken to me about himself , but he practically never said a word about his private affairs ; he only seemed interested in talking about me
0	that 's how it is in this world : every soul is tried and is consoled
0	oh , i would have learned about that horrible , sinister intrigue without him !
0	i realize that it came out sounding banal , superficial , crude , and even somehow younger than my age
0	again , i won ’ t give a lengthy account of their childhood and school years , but will only outline the most important facts
0	although i had not in the least expected to see him there , the very second i saw him i guessed who he was , while still failing to understand how he could have spent all those days so close to me without my ever hearing a sound from him
0	everybody noticed an important decoration which flashed on his front for all to see
0	but when smurov had vaguely told krasotkin that alyosha was planning to come and see him on very important business , kolya had told him to go and tell that karamazov fellow that krasotkin knew what to do himself , that he needed no advice , and that if he decided to go and see ilyusha , he would go in his own good time , and that he had his own reasons for acting the way he was acting
0	i ’ ll tell you our secret , mitya whispered hurriedly
0	i guess you ’ re right , alyosha said with a smile , and i only hope you ’ re not making fun of me now , ivan
0	so lambert had already met versilov , had succeeded in getting to him , and in contacting anna too !
0	i was simply trying to make you look at things from where i stand
0	she gave me an alarmed , questioning look
0	i love life ; i am horribly afraid for my life ; in that respect i am an awful coward
0	i ’ m sorry , you ’ re right , it wasn ’ t you , it was i who was screaming
0	she holds the white roses that had been placed in her hand when they had laid her in the coffin
0	perhaps you ’ re the superior one and not ivan , after all
0	mrs prutkov shrieked and literally sank her nails into my shoulder
0	thus , by not denying it , i did in a way confirm lambert 's lie
0	i am the greatest doctor in moscow , he said , so what do you mean by sending for me for such a trifling thing when all moscow is waiting for me ?
0	ah , dolgoruky , why should i lie ?
0	for if you felt i was likely to do it and nevertheless you left , that was just like saying to me : go ahead , kill my father
0	and if he had not had that unfortunate pestle , he might or might not have struck his father , but he certainly would not have killed him
0	he had already gone down the hall several times , entered the rooms of the doctor ’ s wife , and glanced worriedly at the children who , still sitting obediently over the book , smiled broadly at him each time he came in , hoping he would do something very funny and fantastic
0	but it doesn ’ t make much difference , it ’ s the same sort of thing
0	it was summertime , and a pigeon entered a window of the cupola , flew across it and out the window on the opposite side
0	oh , he felt quite exultant internally , so much had been gained by that testimony !
0	it had been paid for by katerina
0	but it 's all restlessness
0	all this , as well as the talk we had the evening before it all happened , i ’ ve told dr herzenstube and also the examining magistrate , mr nelyudov , and they took it all down and they have it all in writing
0	the boy said it to you , not to us , you fool
0	she had followed tikhomirov 's tirade intently
0	ah , good god , what a coincidence !
0	as i could hardly stand up , he had to support me as he led me away
0	shall i give up and leave ?
0	miusov shouted , as though no longer able to bear it
0	as to her , well , again this is a matter for her to decide rather than for me , as i already told you
0	i ’ m sure he fully appreciates that and , besides , he asked me to tell you how sorry he is
0	or was he just pretending not to see them ?
0	i have a charming little pamphlet translated from french
0	but he certainly loved people : throughout his life he seemed to believe in people and trust them , and yet no one ever thought him simple-minded or naive
0	she had heard him say things just as peculiar before
0	although , it 's almost impossible for a third person to understand fully the relations between two people in love , i know that sergei was bitterly reproachful all the time , for , believe it or not , he was madly jealous !
0	tell me , had you ever seen twenty thousand rubles before ?
0	she has nothing , nothing , to do with it !
0	wait for the verdict !
0	and i confess that even now , when everything is over , i am completely at a loss as to how to judge that unhappy man who made things so hard for us
0	but he was still grinning and looked at ivan with the same composure
0	a latin translation of hippocrates ' greek motto ( what medicine can not cure , iron will cure ; what iron can not cure , fire will cure ) was found in dolgushin 's ( dergachev in the adolescent ) summer house where his subversive tracts were printed
0	these are the moments when we recognize in the accused the animal terror that seizes him when he realizes that all is lost , although he continues to fight back because his instinct for self-preservation has been aroused
0	you are really distressing me , katerina , my dear , mrs prutkov said in a pleading tone
0	and if i am right , if they can not forgive , what harmony can there be ?
0	he confided all these thoughts to me when he came to see me , for he came to my house every day , as i was his only friend
0	listen , olympe , the prince had no idea that mrs akhmakov was due to arrive today
0	yes , that ’ s right , mitya said , glancing absentmindedly at his hands
0	had i not been in such a state of wild agitation , i certainly would not have fired such a question at a man whom i had never met before , of whom i had only heard
0	he had not yet thought out what to say , how to answer our questions , but he was ready for us with his stubborn denial : i did not kill my father !
0	so you think i am something of a chameleon , do you ?
0	he showed them the little hole for priming and explained to them about the recoil
0	from that point of view , i would be rather curious to have a look at you , if i had time to bother with it all now
0	i did not quite understand her at first
0	mitya exclaimed with great delight
0	do you really imagine that a man , endowed with relentless energy , who 's always on the alert , who 's always thinking and calculating , who 's always on the go , watching for an opportunity , that such a man wo not acquire enough know-how to earn every day , say , twenty kopeks more than he spends on his upkeep ?
0	it took about three hours to get to volovya , where mitya at once ordered post-horses for the drive back to town
0	our town was just like anywhere else : at first , immediately following the preliminary investigation , mitya ’ s relatives and other people who wanted to visit him had to submit to certain regulations
0	the corners of his lips quivered
0	what about ten gold half-imperials ?
0	i was in a great hurry
0	mrs prutkov exclaimed , jumping up from her seat with such suddenness that she took me completely by surprise
0	it was just after trifon had learned about all this that he met mitya in the darkness , going back into the house from the balcony , and that mitya noticed that something had changed both in trifon ’ s attitude and in the way he spoke
0	then , if i insisted too rigorously on settling the matter of my inheritance , she could have me thrown into debtor ’ s prison
0	no one in the whole world can possibly know what i ’ m going through
0	rakitin muttered , somewhat taken aback
0	this is a perfectly proper news item in society life
0	and how could he know you have forgiven him ?
0	and , true enough , it was getting quite late
0	i was very drunk and the gypsies were singing
0	then , in petersburg , there was that auction sale i have already mentioned when i made in one go seven rubles and ninety-five kopeks profit
0	alas , you must not believe that men can be united in this way
0	i will come and see you or you will come and see me
0	as the man crying out those words is felled , his skull broken ; and then there is a stream of phrases , statements , gestures , and exclamations , all of which could bias people ’ s opinions , sway their feelings
0	i mean you , grushenka , you helped me to recover my soul just now
0	and he had been dreaming all night about the scene he had witnessed between the two women
0	that long-legged bastard—two days ago , he made my life miserable in front of respectable people
0	why haven ’ t you been to see us for so long ?
0	what we had said was quite enough , on top of what our eyes had told each other
0	you must be making fun of me !
0	no , you haven ’ t stolen from her , since you ’ ll give it back to her
0	there was one thing in his manner , however , of which the ladies did not approve—that was the way he bent his back
0	one , for instance , would suggest to another : i ’ ll tell him i lost my temper with you this morning , and you confirm it—and this , just to have something to tell , just to satisfy the elder
0	remember how we used to look together for what you referred to as facts ?
0	what do you want of me now ?
0	out of their way , mitya !
0	christ , she said , will forgive everything , arkasha
0	why , i believe you told me you were only thirteen !
0	later , those words were remembered and discussed
0	their combined wisdom and their desperate efforts to create a nobler man with greater dignity , the ideal set by christ , have come to naught
0	if you have something the matter with your nose , for instance , they ’ ll send you to paris where , they say , there is the foremost nose specialist in europe
0	when he says something like that , it is always the truth
0	about ten days after the funeral , katerina , agafia , and agafia ’ s aunt left for moscow
0	beauty is a terrifying thing !
0	wasn ’ t it in your pocket ?
0	he worked somewhere on vasilievsky island and as a rule came home punctually just before noon
0	yes , dmitry said , i may very well have told grushenka about that fateful day , as katya likes to call it
0	i have always remembered the promise i made to lisa to reform and start a new life
0	that reasonable man , i understand , gave the most precise explanations and provided very interesting information that fully vindicated him in the eyes of those on whom his fate depended
0	when friends came to see him , he would say to them : it ’ s so nice of you to come , for i don ’ t know what i ’ ve done to earn your love and i can ’ t begin to understand how you can love someone like me , nor can i understand how i could have failed to appreciate it until now
0	to whom else could i come back when everything 's over ?
0	well , be honest , never tell lies , do not covet your neighbor 's house
0	all of a sudden , ferapont ’ s countenance changed completely
0	is that a decent way to act ?
0	eighteen months ago he could have pulled off a perfect deal with that baby , but he fell on his face , yes , siree !
0	why should i go to chermashnya ?
0	finally , her plan had been approved by lambert
0	if that ’ s the way it is—it was you who killed him all right , smerdyakov hissed
0	i was both very surprised and very frightened , for i had never yet been treated so roughly
0	by that you mean you ’ ll act as if everything is permitted ’ ?
0	they asked me some questions , i answered something or other , and they allowed me to leave
0	for if you lose interest out of idleness , supercilious pride , or , worst of all , greed , others will come from all directions and snatch your flock from you
0	but you did not want to deprive man of freedom and you rejected this suggestion , for , you thought , what sort of freedom would they have if their obedience was bought with bread ?
0	that would really finish him off , for to this moment he does not really believe that such a letter exists
0	and it was during this moment of exaltation that our prosecutor rose to his feet to object to some points brought up by the defense
0	he came into the room , picked up his top hat , glanced at the mirror , ran his fingers through his hair , and , without even turning his head in my direction , went out into the corridor and stopped by the door to the room of the two women
0	however , to this day , i believe in that strange promise , and i want to record it so i will always remember it
0	but , try as hard as i would , i could not remain detached
0	alyosha took his , took a few sips , and put it back on the table
0	makar 's letters were answered promptly by my mother in very much the same style
0	by now martha had reached rock bottom in horror
0	i asked you to come in because i had something important for you
0	and then there is the son breaking into his father ’ s house , killing him and , at the same time , not killing him
0	whereupon katerina broke off their engagement then and there
0	as alyosha entered , snegirev hardly glanced at him
0	her features are still the same , but now every single one of these features seems to have been twisted and distorted by an unimaginable impudence
0	and men rejoice at being led like cattle again , with the terrible gift of freedom that brought them so much suffering removed from them
0	but did such a murder occur ?
0	and her guess was almost correct : actually , i did feel something of the sort at the time
0	kolya was shouting at the top of his voice and beaming with delight
0	you treat money as if it were garbage or water
0	therefore , we may ask ourselves what could have kept him alive ?
0	mitya tried to object
0	gregory obviously was more familiar with the garden than the stranger and , realizing that the other man was dashing toward the bathhouse , took a short cut
0	friends and teachers , i have often heard , and of late more than ever , that our clergy , particularly our rural clergy , complain bitterly over their lowly status and the low stipends they receive
0	ah , damn it , why did i have to stumble on lambert just then when i was feeling overcome by all these thoughts ?
0	but , all right , let us assume that it was open and that the accused denied it and lied , claiming that it was closed out of an instinct of self-preservation , which would be quite understandable under the circumstances
0	i can say that because i know him well
0	he listened in silence , never commenting when i mentioned the rumor about sergei marrying anna , and when i repeated my enthusiastic praise of anna 's qualities , he just muttered something to the effect that she was a nice girl
0	and , besides , what can prince sergei hope for from mrs akhmakov ?
0	please go to lise and cheer her up , as you always do so well
0	how can a man realize that he has acted despicably , admit it , and then continue acting in the same way ?
0	he had a large billiard room with all the proper furnishings , that is , even with black-framed pictures of english race-horses hanging on the walls , the type always found in the billiard room of a single man
0	but for two days now , since the time i would met him in the street and had announced theatrically that i would return the letter to katerina at mrs prutkov 's , lambert had organized a sort of surveillance of mrs prutkov 's apartment or , to be more precise , he would enlisted the finnish maid to spy for him
0	why , is there anyone who doesn ’ t wish his father ’ s death ?
0	but certainly , even during their first conversation , he must have succeeded in hinting very clearly that i had a certain letter in my possession , that he—lambert—was the only person who knew i had the letter , and that i was planning to use it to avenge myself on mrs akhmakov , and so on and so forth
0	these words brought many thoughts to my mind
0	actually , she went to the registry office and got mr versilov 's address
0	but the second he came in , i asked him about it
0	that day was the first time i would seen mother and versilov together
0	the word parricide ’ is simply one of those words that frighten us because we have not grasped its meaning and so find ourselves in the position of ostrovsky ’ s ignorant characters
0	i walked over to dergachev , pressed his hand as hard as i could , and shook it violently
0	and then there were those contradictions in him : he was proud and at the same time slavishly devoted to me ; but despite that slavish devotion he could flare up at any moment and start arguing with me , fly into a rage , and not agree with anything
0	so let us never forget him , let us always treasure his memory in our hearts , now and always !
0	it sounded like an incantation
0	kolya said nervously and quickly
0	in the back room of the little cafe , they really were serving oysters and we installed ourselves at a little table covered with a stained , greasy cloth
0	that , of course , can be said of the young people of any generation , but i believe it 's especially true of this one
0	that ’ s very important material evidence
0	he could just as well have said that her love had its roots in the institution of serfdom !
0	such is their incurable instinct
0	but since i climb up to the attic every day , why shouldn ’ t i fall from the attic again tomorrow ?
0	you mean that you apply them to us and that you regard us as socialists ?
0	i felt terribly offended
0	men have suddenly realized that they have been left on earth completely alone and they feel like abandoned children
0	she cried again with uncontrollable emotion
0	they had obviously been waiting for just that moment in the belief that the healing powers of the dead man would at once become effective
0	now , when ivan stopped , words gushed from him , as if he could no longer hold them back
0	it was only because i was so annoyed that i had refused to go to anna 's before
0	oh , what a contemptible creature i was !
0	since i have cash at home , i ’ ll take three thousand rubles with me and tell them that smerdyakov gave me the money
0	still , there was that duplicity—i mean the suspicion of duplicity—that tormented me
0	i knew that he had serious differences with his father and i always believed that his father had taken undue advantage of him
0	you needn ’ t worry , i ’ ll save him for you !
0	suddenly that broad smile of his reappeared on his face , but this time he was looking at me firmly , no longer puzzled as before
0	he was actually gnashing his teeth with rage !
0	at the same time , however , an acute anguish from the uncertainty of the situation mounted within him
0	and , on this point at least , i fully share the opinion of that pseudo-great man
0	julia , hurry , go to the cellar and get me a piece of ice , and also another bowl of water
0	but do you know what would be best ?
0	shortly after getting the four-year-old mitya off his hands , fyodor karamazov married a second time
0	nothing beyond this leaked out , and it was in this form that the report appeared in the press with only the participants ' initials
0	besides , i want him , too
0	the time has come when you must hear what i have to tell you , because otherwise you won ’ t even be able to understand what this two hundred rubles means to me , the poor man went on , gradually working himself up into a state of wild exuberance
0	it was a pretty long wait , an hour perhaps , for it was close to nine when they finally came to fetch me
0	you ’ re the one who said that everything was permitted , so why are you so worried now ?
0	it was a bleak , foggy , raw day—an ideal day for hunting
0	on the other hand , if your father dies right now before anything of that sort happens , each of the three of you is sure to get forty thousand right away , even mr dmitry , whom mr karamazov hates so much , because there happens to be no will
0	however , it was not until quite recently that he succeeded in attracting the attention of a wider circle of readers , and it was one particular incident that made them notice and remember him—and a rather curious incident at that
0	could you , for instance , have said what year it was if someone had asked you ?
0	and , indeed , the four officials were very minor , three of them already gray-haired ( and the fourth only somewhat younger ) , none of them known in our society , people who probably eked out a living on a small salary , were married to elderly and unpresentable wives , and had many children who probably ran around barefoot
0	there is so much in it that is great , mysterious , inconceivable !
0	why , you ’ ll be back tomorrow , won ’ t you ?
0	he smiled slyly and raised one finger
0	i am madly happy , madly happy !
0	we are late as is
0	and then , last summer on st peter 's day , i again found myself in that desert—god just willed it that way— and when i walked into his cell , i saw it standing there , that thing , the microscope ; he had ordered it from abroad and paid a lot of money for it
0	they ’ ll think it because i gave away the big secret about the signals
0	probably he meant is not it just like her ?
0	also , he had very little time : he had other business to attend to elsewhere that same morning , so he had to be very quick about it
0	the ransom , madam , the ransom !
0	go now , and fear nothing
0	once every member of the human race discards the idea of god ( and i believe that such an era will come , like some new geological age ) , the old world-view will collapse by itself without recourse to cannibalism
0	at that moment a door slammed and someone walked quickly into the next room
0	don ’ t be frightened of him
0	i do not agree with you—it 's not up to me at all ; my hands are tied , do not you see ?
0	i noticed that he looked at me now and then out of the corner of his eye , but mostly he looked out of the window and pretended to be busy with his schoolwork , although i knew very well he did not have his mind on his lessons
0	he had reached the last degree of irritation
0	mitya was led away
0	indeed , he did not wish to pursue the matter any further and turned away from me
0	when they heard me coming up , they turned their backs to the door and watched me attentively
0	if i care to be friends with someone , it ’ s my own business and i don ’ t have to account to anyone—that ’ s the way i feel about it
0	good-by then , kiss me once more
0	so it shall be and so be it !
0	but he broke his motion in mid-air
0	so some time later , i was sitting just as i ’ m sitting now when that general comes in , the same general , you know , who came here during holy week
0	yes , money came into it too
0	i am not saying that their lives are bound to be disorderly and ugly ; on the contrary , i feel it would be improper and ugly if they settled down and wound up resembling ordinary people
0	in a large , legible hand he had written on it : i condemn myself for my past life and i sentence myself to suffer for the rest of my life
0	at last the presiding judge declared the case concerning the murder of fyodor pavlovich karamazov open—i don ’ t remember the exact wording of the declaration
0	in a frightened voice
0	that apartment , you know , was rented in my name and it 's mrs prutkov who 's paying the rent
0	no time for oysters , mitya remarked , and , besides , i ’ m not hungry
0	all right , he said in the end , now go and play and live some of life for me
0	what if he 's insane ?
0	here it is , alyosha said , taking katerina ’ s note out of his pocket
0	but even so , i will come back to you , to you , my last angel
0	gradually a cheerful and rather unattractive group of passengers formed around him
0	i recognized my sister lisa
0	what can you know about it anyway ?
0	then sergei , who had remained in the room , went up to zershikov and demanded that he publicly proclaim my innocence and , moreover , that he apologize to me in a formal letter
0	that visibly annoyed lisa , but vasin persisted
0	i put expensive clothes on his back ; i bought him an embroidered shirt and nice leather shoes for his feet , and i am treating him as if he was the son of a general , but i see he still is not grateful
0	no , it 's not his baby at all !
0	but , anyway , i ’ m going far away and i won ’ t come back
0	i felt i was dressed very decently : my suit and my overcoat were quite new and my linen was perfectly clean ( maria had seen to that especially for this occasion )
0	ah , never mind , i would recover and somehow make up for whatever blame i might have had in this business—i had fifty years before me to do it !
0	after that , i wondered which i should do : send the letter and stay alive or send it and die ?
0	i may be witty , but if a talleyrand or a piron [ ] came along , my wit would appear dull in comparison with theirs
0	he sent for two of his aunts who were shopkeepers somewhere in the province
0	yes , that ’ s just what they do
0	but i do not suppose you can understand what i mean
0	we can not afford to pay so much for a ticket
0	the elder looked at him smilingly and said :
0	and i also heard his idiotio theory that if there is no immortality of the soul , there can be no virtue and therefore everything is permissible
0	i remained standing where i was
0	then , describing a full circle , he made the sign of the cross eight times in succession , once on each wall and once in each corner
0	that elder is the pride and glory of the monastery
0	i know for a fact that there are people who get more and more excited with every blow when they beat someone , until they experience a sensual joy , a real , voluptuous pleasure , stronger and stronger as they go on
0	you are going to moscow tomorrow !
0	i ’ d rather suffer all my life than that
0	miusov said in a shaking voice , feeling that he was losing control over himself
0	do not be angry with us , arkasha—there are plenty of intelligent people without us in the world , but who will there be to love us if we lose one another ?
0	well , what the hell do i care—if he wants it to have overtones , it can have them
0	anyway , i had to go and find out !
0	but then he started whispering into the policeman 's ear
0	what do you think , for instance , he ’ s been talking about now ?
0	people here are third rate—they are just a bunch of young hoodlums , he later complained to me
0	the other five boys now had their eyes riveted on alyosha
0	such things are usually answered by a challenge and so , first of all , i want to settle our money accounts
0	i wrote it as a joke , for i consider poetry writing a despicable occupation
0	for if you repine , as you were repining just now , and declare that you would be glad to have your nose pulled every day of your life , your wish has indirectly been fulfilled because , having lost your nose , you have had it permanently pulled off , as it were
0	in fact , you went through three thousand that time
0	didn ’ t you hear the bell announcing the service ?
0	you proposed to anna officially and she rejected you ?
0	no , he wanted to come only for a moment to visit his children and he chose to appear where the fires were crackling under the heretics
0	and so , realizing he was at fault and sincerely regretting his behavior , but being too embarrassed to come here and apologize in person , he asked his son ivan and myself to convey to you his profound apologies and regrets
0	now , since the accused assures us that he is not the murderer , it must be smerdyakov , for there was no one else about who could have done it
0	once i had gotten myself something to wear , i knew that it would last me a long time
0	tell her i agree with her , that i deserve the names she calls me , if that makes her feel any better
0	as to the other pole , who sat by the wall at some distance and looked at the company with scorn and defiance as he listened to the general conversation , mitya noticed only that he was a little younger than the one on the sofa
0	i was still looking fixedly at the teacher as i spoke
0	well , then , i turn to that imbecile and i say to him , i ’ m looking at the geese because i ’ m trying to figure out what they ’ re thinking about
0	why , you are looking cheerful today !
0	it was not quite one o'clock yet
0	but i shall come to that later , for i want the events to unfold before you step by step , in proper order
0	that shows how important you were to him
0	i wrote a letter to my former regimental commander and my brother officers in which i confessed my lies and fully vindicated stepanov 's honor
0	that did not bother me at all because i myself had no idea how come
0	it was our carpenter who made the coffin
0	who 's paying for your clothes , who 's feeding you and giving you money to play roulette ?
0	and she was right
0	perkhotin installed himself on the chair opposite him and the champagne was on the table in no time
0	why did you have to pester me that way , then , for such a long time ?
0	this is the man who ’ s made such a hell , such a nightmare , of my life !
0	perhaps it was just pleasant to brag , to say , see all the money i threw away
0	and what ’ s that now ?
0	and if i was in no state then to make anything of it , at least i did notice it
0	as i have said , i was already almost out of my mind
0	and you must go
0	his direct family was small : he had been a widower for twenty years and had only one daughter , the widow of a general , who was expected to arrive any day from moscow , probably a young woman of character , whom he obviously feared
0	from my own words he had gathered how much i valued the letter and how afraid i was that someone might take it away from me
0	she was a consumptive seventeen-year-old girl , incredibly beautiful i understand , but also highly eccentric
0	what if a patient , whose sores you were cleaning , instead of being grateful to you , tormented you with his whims and had no appreciation whatsoever for your services to mankind , talked rudely to you , or even complained about you to your superiors , as people who are in pain so often do ?
0	alphonsine gets sick just looking at him and wo not let him near her
0	so , fourteen years ago i fell into the hands of the living god ’ —that ’ s how those fourteen years are to be described
0	the blood rushed to his head
0	i must now confess why i was so enthusiastic about vasin 's theory of ideas transmuted into feelings
0	they washed gregory ’ s head with water and vinegar , and this brought him back to his senses
0	all you need to know is that , about a month ago , she sent for me and gave me three thousand rubles that she wanted me to mail to moscow , to her sister and some other relative of hers
0	she jumped up and , with the shriek of a wounded animal , rushed out of the room so unexpectedly that no one had time to stop her , and dashed straight toward where mitya was
0	we have started our romance and i want to be given a chance to complete it
0	there 's really nothing so marvelous about people to bother much about them
0	i saw that lukeria wanted to ask me something , perhaps even send me on some errand or other , but that was really the last thing i needed !
0	and then something else happened : the money that had been lying in front of zershikov 's very nose and that belonged to the bank—four hundred rubles in all—had vanished and zershikov was pointing at the spot where it had been just a moment before , right next to me , next to the spot where my own money was piled up , much closer to me than to aferdov
0	but what is it , mother dear ?
0	yesterday you asked me for three hundred rubles , here !
0	if you wish , sir , you can tip me five rubles , but i won ’ t accept more
0	a score of visitors , this time all peasant women , were waiting below by the gallery built outside the hermitage wall
0	suppose that young man wanted to borrow money or find out an address , or something like that ?
0	this is my last message to you : seek happiness through sorrow
0	rien , rien du tout
0	every woman is a snake and every snake is a woman !
0	and , grabbing her scarf and fur coat , the old lady burst out onto the landing , putting on her coat as she ran downstairs
0	so obviously i am a born flunkey !
0	it 's almost autumn , the weather is bright , but sometimes there 's a crisp edge in the air
0	his saintly elder died today , you know , the holy father zosima
0	allow me to stay here , alyosha murmured beseechingly
0	so it is quite beyond me why you have made such a mystery of the fifteen hundred rubles that you supposedly put aside from the three thousand you had misappropriated earlier
0	i could easily do without their bread—i don ’ t need it at all : i could go into the forest and live on mushrooms and berries , while here they can ’ t leave , for they can ’ t do without the bread they ’ re given
0	' i see , he said ; t know , he said , 'your merchant will pay you if he feels like it and he wo not if he does not , but if you try to sue him you will only be out of pocket even more
0	i believe he 's a man who can set himself gigantic tasks and perhaps can even carry them out but who refuses to account to anyone for anything he does
0	what von sohnish trick did you play on them ?
0	do you know how to sew , then ?
0	et je te benis !
0	first , there 's the difference in age and , secondly , i have not even got a real name
0	yesterday , when he learned of smerdyakov ’ s death , he was so shocked by the news that it did , in fact , drive him insane
0	ivan cried , almost in despair
0	in that case , why not come to my place ?
0	it ’ s just as if they ’ d stolen it from you !
0	you take your way and i ’ ll take mine
0	what about my own self-esteem , and what about lisa to whom i lied and whom i intended to desert ?
0	but i am sure you must have heard that versilov broke an icon into two yesterday
0	wouldid you hear , you said , 'how this boy , at his age , recited the lines
0	katerina seemed very agitated , and yet determined
0	then they could help themselves to a cup and come back and carry on to the end
0	n-no , he said , i didn ’ t come with karamazov
0	then he told me casually that this was a peculiarity that the prince had developed only since his illness , in fact , quite a recent development
0	much longer than that even—i could calculate it for you if you gave me a pencil and a piece of paper
0	what is it , kolya ?
0	just imagine , he graduated from a good cadet corps school , even served briefly as an ensign in a regiment !
0	i said that at the table yesterday just to tease you , and i saw how your eyes were shining
0	versilov was not in the room
0	and later , speaking of the lawyer , who almost succeeded in having the case dismissed , he remarked : and what 's a lawyer but a conscience for hire
0	he walks among them in silence , a gentle smile of infinite compassion on his lips
0	people seem to be quarreling all the time up there , and today his wife even retired to her room in tears
0	you ’ ve hit the bull ’ s eye , mr ivan , and i ’ m sure you ’ ll act like the clever man you are
0	perhaps he ought to have been shot , to satisfy the moral indignation that such an act arouses in us ?
0	maxim , who was two rooms away , heard the crash and roared with anger
0	but she was obviously relieved to know that sergei 's statement had not substantially aggravated vasin 's case
0	why , you just said
0	i don ’ t want any praise from that stinking mob !
0	the great conquerors , the tamerlanes and the genghis khans , who swept like whirlwinds across the earth , striving to subdue the whole world , were also , even if they were unaware of it themselves , obeying that eternal human craving for universal union
0	do you know what happened after that ?
0	i think you are simply annoyed because you have not been very brilliant today
0	you ’ re mistaken , alyosha , my dear boy , he said , looking at his brother with an expression that alyosha had never seen on his face before : there was a youthful sincerity in it and a feeling too strong to conceal
0	you don ’ t know me !
0	they even crackled like new bills as he smoothed them out
0	and she turned out to be right
0	you could have guessed because my begging you not to go all the way to moscow but only to chermashnya showed that i wanted you to be closer to us , and thought that , knowing that you weren ’ t too far away , your brother , mr dmitry , wouldn ’ t dare be so bold
0	first of all , prince sergei never recovered and died in the prison hospital before his trial was scheduled to begin
0	he felt more and more ashamed of himself for having told these people so sincerely and in such soul-searching detail about his pangs of jealousy over grushenka
0	the temperature had dropped now and , after a warm day , it was beginning to freeze
0	mitya examined the face with immense hatred
0	having vowed to remain silent , as i explained in the previous chapter , i expected to keep my vow
0	right , sir , so i reckon they may still be up if they ’ re playing cards
0	his reading of godly things lent his face an even graver expression
0	as for my biliousness , well , you have been treating me for a year now and if you have not been able to cure me all this time , that 's not much credit to you , is it ?
0	i immediately noticed versilov 's irritation , which was unusual for him
0	where did you have coffee ?
0	he could have been delirious when he came to
0	oh , never , never would they be able to feed themselves without us !
0	i was painfully surprised
0	and since i was not consulted when the world was created , i reserve the right to express my opinion on the subject
0	it ’ s because he feels for her , for his mother , he feels sorry for her
0	to go back to alyosha , he was a special friend of the inspector ’ s and the old man liked to discuss abstruse subjects with him
0	he leaned his head toward me
0	in the end , she was hardly ever at home during the day , for it goes without saying that she also visited sergei in prison
0	do you have any idea what the word wife ’ means ?
0	she doesn ’ t see it , though
0	i don ’ t want them to be warned
0	i assume that everything was settled within one hour of prince sergei 's visit to her—which only goes to show how ill timed his noble gesture was
0	and so the church , acting like a tender and loving mother , will take no part in meting out punishment because , even without the church , a man condemned by the state courts is sufficiently punished , and there should be someone , after all , to take pity on him
0	no , he began again , there ’ s so much in life and there ’ s life underground , too
0	wait , he said , sitting up on the sofa , about an hour ago i took that towel from over there , wet it , and held it against my head
0	when they met they only dared exchange timid and fleeting glances
0	nelyudov stopped insisting , although when his eyes met the prosecutor ’ s he understood from his colleague ’ s look that all hope was not yet lost
0	it ’ s a good thing you came , ivan said dreamily , as if he hadn ’ t heard alyosha ’ s last exclamation
0	i always arrive exactly on time , knowing that punctuality is the courtesy of kings
0	you ’ re no better than a brat yourself ; indeed , you ’ re as bad as the youngest of those urchins !
0	here the prosecutor decided to outline the character of the late smerdyakov , who , according to him , had put an end to his life in a fit of violent madness
0	he gave me time to recover and then asked : well , what do you say to that , old man ?
0	i wouldn ’ t think of refusing it , not for one moment , rakitin said in a hoarse voice
0	whatever the elder predicted , especially with such precision , was bound to happen
0	but the cart moved off , and their hands were separated
0	it ’ s true , though , he had not yet seen the man
0	and that sum i ’ m waiting for
0	let me tell you , then , that this dream , as you call it , will most certainly come true
0	she stopped dead when she saw me
0	but i see it turns out to be , relatively speaking , only a minor misappropriation of three thousand rubles , and moreover , probably only a temporary misappropriation , which i suppose could be considered simply an irresponsible act , but certainly not something that would disgrace a man once and for all
0	i was completely bewildered
0	just let me have my pistols now
0	the church would aim at the total , true regeneration of man , his spiritual rebirth , and the salvation of his
0	next day he came back from school looking terrible , all pale in the facewhat ’ s the matter , ilyusha ?
0	at the same time , i realized that people who were unquestionably my inferiors knew how to behave with amazing dignity , and that drove me into a fury and made me lose my self-control even more
0	he wants to stop me from marrying her , and he is encouraging that good-for-nothing to marry her
0	baron bjoring 's position and his reputation forbid him from stooping
0	this thought gave me courage and , despite the confusion in my mind , cheered me up
0	no , you will never know , mother , how much i loved you then !
0	and since people gossip anyway , they would only gossip more wickedly
0	yes , she was in rather a hurry !
0	and they got hold of me too , shouting , you were in it with him
0	that made rakitin lose his temper altogether
0	he did not try to hide his views , just the contrary , and this enables me to speak boldly of him , not as a private individual , of course , but as a member of the karamazov family
0	is it possible that the world as it is today will come to an end just because of finance ?
0	now i feel all dirty inside having told you all that
0	but i refused to think about it
0	how much will he understand of what 's going on ?
0	well , anyway , there 's nothing else left for us to do
0	he had lived in our town for many years and had always behaved with great dignity
0	so what happened when he finally finished his walk ?
0	vous avez de i'argentp no ?
0	let me try to make clear what i mean by a comparison or rather by a parallel
0	his headache was getting worse and worse
0	when she heard these things , she would comment to her lady companions : it serves her right
0	i ’ ve come , alyosha muttered , feeling he was getting mixed up , i came
0	it doesn ’ t seem as if my heart will ever stop palpitating—i can ’ t wait any longer
0	it 's true that he himself told me that day that he was feeling happy and elated and that he was aware he was talking with great abandon
0	you see , i pinched her mob-cap because i needed a rag
0	he would refuse it if it was offered to him
0	they may give us some change
0	she had a good go at it !
0	grushenka walked quickly over to her desk , opened a drawer , took out a purse , fished out a twenty-five-ruble bill , and handed it to rakitin
0	and you know , alexei , there ’ s no need for you to bother to come back ; when you ’ ve finished with katerina , you may as well go straight to the monastery , because that ’ s where you really belong
0	you had a streak of bad luck , pan kalganov , the little pole remarked
0	i would noticed that , although we would arrive together , he would always manage to slip away from me during the evening and never thought of introducing me to any of the people in his set
0	so how could i help being exasperated with myself when i realized into what a helpless creature gambling could turn me ?
0	this , of course , is the result of adopting reforms when the ground is unprepared , especially when the reforms are copied from abroad and alien institutions are transplanted
0	why do they let such people in ?
0	i am here to drive out your guests—the unholy devils that are here with you
0	he banged his forehead ?
0	you know , though , that it is not us you will harm , but yourself , nelyudov said a bit nervously
0	why , of course , why should not she get involved in some plot with him too ?
0	for i am certain , and so are all the jurists , that , without this , the accused would at least have been given the benefit of mitigating circumstances
0	but you ’ re trying to buy the wood from him—the wood !
0	but that was none of my concern and i went right on drinking and having a wild time
0	what kind of a question is that ?
0	the prince had not been informed about the impending arrival of his daughter and did not expect her for another week or so
0	and that , of course , was more important than spending the money on wild parties ; karamazov certainly felt that , knew it
0	i ’ ve already thought it all over
0	well , you must go now , my bereaved boy
0	i may be asked now why they had to bring him to the apartment where i rented a room
0	his whole mentality can be summed up in the words : après moi le déluge
0	soldier ’ s curiosity was hot :
0	never seen anyone so bloodthirsty !
0	when he first arrived , alyosha had seemed to be pondering deeply about something , perhaps trying to decide whether he would be able to give up all or only a couple of rubles
0	oh , it was not just the blood that was being shed at that time that depressed me , nor the burning of the tuileries , but rather all the things that were to follow
0	and , by the way , that sweet brother of yours left for moscow today
0	ah , here you are at last !
0	i managed to control myself and bear her tenderness , but how i hated her at that moment !
0	the bustling shop attendants hurriedly reassured him in sugary tones that the crate in question contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne and a few items of immediate necessity , such as cold snacks and pastry , as well as some sweets , candy , etc
0	i would heard a lot about him and had seen him many times , although he did not know me at all
0	now , i see no reason to conceal from you that gregory himself says that he concluded that you must have just come out of that door , although he did not actually see you do so , since he first caught sight of you when you were already in the middle of the garden , running toward the fence
0	the fellow had waited for this opportunity for such a long time , and now he certainly got it all off his chest
0	olga glanced at her , hesitated for a second , gave me a quick scornful look , turned , and went back into her room
0	i like your face , alyosha
0	my boy , versilov said firmly , not one kopek of that money is mine
0	and his only reason for doing it was that the man had been running occasional errands for me , in connection with a certain business of mine
0	you did it in the street , without scissors ?
0	he sat there sunk in thought , but he could not find an answer
0	but i didn ’ t quite understand—did they really take you to court for it , before a judge ?
0	i ’ ve already told you that !
0	and tell me , mamma , do you still remember that dove in the village church ?
0	there was a moment when i too believed that he loved that woman , but that was not it
0	and then , to top off everything , katerina , the only servant of the doctor ’ s wife , had just the night before taken her poor mistress completely by surprise by announcing to her that she was going to have a baby before morning
0	i wasn ’ t really flogged
0	now i have reached the last twenty-four hours of my story , the closing scene of the final act
0	as i have already mentioned , he was just three when he lost his mother , yet he always remembered how she looked and how she caressed him—just as if she were standing alive before me , he would say
0	he turned away from nelyudov altogether , as if he had decided not even to address him
0	he looked incredibly worn out and exhausted
0	we ’ ll leave forever
0	here ’ s how i propose to end it , ivan said , continuing
0	but alyosha indignantly rejected the suggestion that mitya could have killed for the sake of the money , although he readily conceded that the three thousand rubles had become an obsession with him , that he regarded the sum as rightfully his , as part of his inheritance from his mother that his father had misappropriated , and that , while not in the least avaricious , mitya could not hear the three thousand mentioned without flying into a completely disproportionate rage
0	why do you say that ?
0	a warm and kind smile appeared on his old lips ; he became quite animated ; his wariness and caution vanished ; he seemed to have forgotten that he would been trying to be reserved
0	it could be rakitin , who , for some reason , has been going to see him very often lately
0	he just asked and nothing more
0	he started by asking alyosha when exactly the accused had told him about his hatred for his father and his intention to kill him , and whether he had repeated it again during their last meeting before the catastrophe
0	she whispered pathetically , pointing after him , and then she walked to the middle of the room and started declaiming : monsieur , monsieur , jamais un homme ne fut si cruel , si bismarck , que cet être , qui regarde une femme comme une saleté de hasard
0	besides , i wouldn ’ t know how to say it
0	it was obvious to me from the beginning that he had not come to my attic just to chat with me or to appease my mother 's anxiety
0	tell me this : were you still putting it on when you were in the hospital too ?
0	and that 's why she needs a man to obey : she 's a subservient creature by nature
0	i believed that unquestioningly and it was as though someone had lifted a horrible weight off my chest
0	no , i didn ’ t go home , mitya said with apparent calm , but still looking persistently at the floor
0	i see you looking over there—what would you like ?
0	even without that , i know i won ’ t be admitted straight into the kingdom of heaven ( the mountain not moving when i ask it to shows that they don ’ t believe very much in my faith up there , and so i can ’ t expect too great a reward when i get there ) , and so what good would it do me if , on top of that , i allowed those people to flay me alive without getting anything in return for my pains ?
0	gentlemen , please forgive me for losing my temper again , but it ’ s just as i anticipated : the old hypocrite has lured us all here to take part in a disgraceful public scene
0	as to the guards outside , they did not care one way or the other as long as alyosha had permission from their superiors
0	suddenly i get a tremendous desire to say insulting things about god out loud and i begin to shout foul words
0	and then , just at this moment , there was another unexpected interruption
0	and that was why alyosha had not gone to see kolya as he had planned
0	he reproaches me with thinking that !
0	a clothes line , tied across the room between the stove and the window on the left , was hung with all sorts of ragged washing
0	he produced a ten-ruble bill and i handed him the album
0	grushenka had , however , succeeded in emancipating herself from him while instilling in him a limitless trust in her loyalty
0	one of their stones hurt you pretty badly , i believe , alyosha said
0	and let me tell you—for i don ’ t intend to hide anything from you now—he even spat at me
0	what a repulsive mug the man has , don ’ t you think ?
0	but , after several such exclamations , he somehow forgot to make the point that , if an abominable man like the accused was capable of remembering with gratitude , for twenty-three years , the pound of nuts given to him by the only person who ever treated him with kindness while he lived in his father ’ s house , it stands to reason that this same accused could not have forgotten that twenty-three years ago he was running about loose in his father ’ s backyard , barefoot and with his trousers held up by one remaining button , as the kind dr herzenstube described the scene to us
0	my kinsman peter miusov would rather speeches contained plus de noblesse que de sincérité , whereas i prefer mine to have plus de sincérité que de noblesse , because i don ’ t give a damn about noblesse !
0	and so when i was asked you are a prince then ?
0	as to his being a maniac , i would accept this notion , but only in one particular aspect—namely , when it comes to the three thousand rubles that his father allegedly still owed him , just as the medical experts pointed out
0	he came by train and was very angry
0	taisez-vous , je dormirai apres , he told her and left the room
0	and i am not guilty of robbing him—no , no , how could i be guilty of that ?
0	i do not want any
0	the big , heavy pole asked him threateningly in russian
0	i simply want to tell you about a father meeting his beloved son for the first time , i started in as casual a tone as i could manage
0	yet somehow his dark brown , slightly grizzled hair , his black eyebrows , his big beard , and rather large eyes , instead of giving him character , seemed , on the contrary , to make him look commonplace and uninteresting
0	( versilov said that it was a heart attack )
0	i didn ’ t mention the other human tears with which our earth is soaked from crust to core , because i was deliberately narrowing the subject
0	but i ’ d like to wait here for a while first and find out what you decide about mr karamazov
0	she ’ s not yet sixteen and she ’ s already offering herself , he said scornfully , walking quickly on again
0	are you really so sure of that , my good baron ?
0	but i want you to get out now , this very minute , and never come back
0	of course , for who knows , perhaps we will meet some day as good old friends and remember this scene with nice , jovial laughter ?
0	mitya was in a sort of delirium
0	as i was passing the haymarket watchman 's box , i felt an impulse to embrace the guardian of the peace !
0	i am sure arkady has something on his mind , so let him finish
0	his voice was like a stranger 's
0	ivan asked , suddenly beginning to laugh
0	i don ’ t even want to be bothered with thinking about it !
0	instead of opening up the sky and painting all those angels , i will lower a bright ray down from the sky toward the boy , as if to meet him
0	and so , having understood that , he turns around and joins the
0	mitya told me she was screaming that i ought to be whipped
0	he ’ d never seen it himself and so , when he took it from under the mattress , he ’ d be likely to tear it open to check whether it really contained the money he was after and then just toss the envelope away , in too much of a rush to stop and think that the envelope could be used as evidence against him later , seeing as he ’ s no experienced thief
0	you do not mean it seriously , do you ?
0	it is quite possible that the sight of the old man was more than he could bear at that moment , but such an overt display of hostility surprised even mr karamazov
0	the forester still treated the whole thing almost with scorn and , after he had opened the window , he just mumbled sullenly , it ’ s good enough like this , and went back to sleep , leaving mitya a lighted iron lantern
0	but listen to me , for heaven ’ s sake , perkhotin said , with marked impatience now
0	their grinning faces fell , although they were still not quite sure what kolya was driving at
0	for you hid the deck of cards i brought you , didn ’ t you ?
0	as to the rivalry between the two ladies , as the prosecutor referred to grushenka and katerina , alyosha answered very evasively and even left a couple of questions unanswered altogether
0	but it was not miracles , it was justice that he craved above all !
0	and why did you take twenty-five rubles from him ?
0	remember how sometimes we spent hours on end discussing bare statistics , such as how many schools we have and the prospects of education in our country ; then we counted murders and other criminal offenses and tried to compare these figures with actual news items
0	i am not talking about myself , but about the russian idea
0	and that is supposed to prove that everything took place exactly according to the plan explained in the letter , so that it is a fatal and not a ridiculous letter
0	once i gave an onion away and here i am
0	it was worded differently , but this is its purport : you wanted to come into the world and you came empty-handed , with nothing but some vague promise of freedom , which , in their simple-mindedness and innate irresponsibility , men can not even conceive and which they fear and dread , for there has never been anything more difficult for man and for human society to bear than freedom !
0	but you will come running to me all right
0	but what ’ s the difference—walk a quadrillion kilometers or lie there eternally ?
0	since they are spiteful , i will be spiteful too ; since they are heartless , i will also be heartless
0	i am absolutely convinced that my brother is innocent
0	you know , dmitry calls you the cherub
0	alyosha , my pet , i look at you and i can hardly believe you are here , in my house !
0	the real reason for his removal from petersburg was to try to prevent rumors being spread about his engagement to anna , to stifle them in the embryo , so to speak
0	and will you cry for me ?
0	no , ivan , you said several times yourself that you were the murderer
0	and as to the ideas he may get into his head—well , i ’ ve always been of the opinion that the best way of handling the ordinary russian is to flog him : he ’ s a scoundrel and there ’ s no need to be sorry for him
0	i have got to know him very well : he 's a gloomy and suspicious man , and , although deep down he may be very kind , he tends to see evil in just about everything—in that , however , he 's very much like me
0	and he moved the boy to his house
0	alyosha stopped a couple of steps away from him , looking at him in surprise
0	when asked about the money fyodor karamazov had prepared for her , she said she had never seen it and had only heard from the murderer that there was an envelope with three thousand rubles in it
0	well , when lise saw you approaching the house , she let out a cry , became hysterical , and had her wheel-chair moved to that room there
0	you know , i ’ m surprised that some people can go through life without even wondering about these things
0	you will freeze to death , you drunken swine , you moron , you will freeze to death if you do not get up !
0	he was still under the impression that grushenka was really there , hiding somewhere in the house
0	but no , i left simply because i felt terribly depressed here and a moment came when it was more than i could bear
0	i would made up whole scenes in which i was dignified , proud , and a little sad , and i would hoped perhaps to meet prince v too and thus gain direct access to high society
0	stay right where you are !
0	the one on the sofa was sprawled out , smoking a pipe , a smallish , pudgy , broad-faced man , disapproving of something or other—that was mitya ’ s fleeting impression of him
0	of course , after their first meeting , versilov refused to believe that she was all that ; indeed , he suspected just the opposite , namely , that she was a hypocrite and a jesuit
0	on the other hand , during that night , he was submerged by waves of a peculiar and degrading fear which , he felt , drained him of his physical strength
0	besides , you could have given her an iou or , even better , offered her the same security as you offered mr samsonov and mrs khokhlakov
0	the elder varsonofy did at times seem a little strange , the monk said , but many of the stories that are told about him are nonsense
0	anyway , if that ’ s how you feel , why are you going there yourself to make it up with ilyusha ?
0	oh , i love the aspirations of my ardent young friends , trembling with eagerness to live !
0	but i remember that , before i was eight and before i had learned to read properly , i had a sort of spiritual experience
0	as i said , i was pleased about i do not know what
0	i see , and besides i told you to come here myself yesterday
0	obviously i could not be kind and understanding at such a moment
0	mitya shouted from his place
0	prove to us once and for all the brute that you are !
0	ivan asked , gnashing his teeth
0	when they returned to gregory , he told them to run at once to the police inspector ’ s house and inform him of what had happened
0	he would have been too preoccupied with self-preservation , and there is absolutely no doubt about that
0	nevertheless , after we would found a cab , mrs prutkov suddenly had a different idea
0	i am sorry but you will just have to take everything off
0	i decided that perhaps versilov wanted to use the occasion to make me meet his son , in fact , my brother
0	tell me , ivan , is there a god or not ?
0	i have read practically nothing and i certainly have no literary bent
0	somehow this particular detail doubled the irritation that was already seething within ivan : why , the creature has taken to wearing glasses now , as well , he thought indignantly
0	i led a wild and drunken life , dmitry went on
0	i am frightened , she whispered
0	what concerned him above all was the image of his beloved elder , the image of the righteous man whom he had venerated to the point of adoration
0	this character was not only a secret agent—he was in charge of a whole team of secret agents which , in its way , made him a man of considerable influence
0	suddenly i became aware of the total silence
0	i asked her to forgive me , because i wanted to punish myself completely
0	that is why , i believe , when many people noticed the smell of decay coming from his dead body , so soon moreover ( less than a day ) after his death , they were delighted beyond all measure
0	it ’ s the same as for a pagan tartar : who could hold him responsible , even in heaven , mr gregory , for not having been born a christian , and who would want to punish him for that , since no one can strip two hides off the same ox ?
0	and he lapsed into gloomy silence
0	if it hadn ’ t been for that same servant gregory , who looked after him almost like a nanny , and who had also aged considerably , karamazov might not even have survived
0	all right , all right
0	and why did i have to fall in love with him so irrevocably during that brief moment i would seen him as a child ?
0	and now , my dear alexei , all my hopes lie with you—there ’ s no need to tell you that my whole life is in your hands
0	yes , right , that would suit him fine !
0	all that time a lively conference had been going on in hushed tones between the two interrogators
0	some claim that she was helped over it , others that it was a case of levitation
0	oh , he is a man of deep , deep scruples !
0	you ’ ll spoil the flowers !
0	shedding their silly tears , they will finally admit that he who created them rebels intended to mock them and no more
0	then we will go to zershikov 's , sit down at opposite ends of the table , and try to win ten thousand
0	i understand very well , mr ivan , sir
0	prince sergei owes him twenty thousand
0	i saw a woman completely naked when i was thirteen , female nakedness in all its entirety , and since then i have felt quite disgusted
0	let me tell you , he ’ s not a man , that one , but a stubborn mule
0	and they didn ’ t get to know much more as time passed , not even after four years during which miss grushenka svetlov had attracted considerable interest by becoming the town ’ s acknowledged great beauty
0	it turns out , consequently , that society is not really protected by this method because , even if a dangerous member is cut off and put far away out of sight , immediately another criminal will appear in his place , and sometimes even two
0	probably he felt he would been humiliated and made ridiculous by a girl whose acceptance he would taken for granted
0	no , pardon , mon cher , he 's something like i remember—she told me something about an old man
0	besides , i ’ m not so sure that it was under the pillow
0	he ’ s still feeling very vague and confused in the head , but , without noticing what he is doing , he crosses the garden , walks over to the lighted windows , and hears from his master—who , of course , is very pleased to see him—what has just happened
0	we have talked enough—i have decided and that 's that
0	the golden age is an aspiration completely beyond the reach of men , but it 's one to which they have devoted all their energies , for which they have willingly died , in the name of which they have killed their prophets , and without which they have no wish to live and do not even know how to die !
0	cher , he whispered now in mad anxiety , trembling like a dry leaf in the autumn wind , tell me the whole truth , my dear boy—where are they planning to hide me away now ?
0	even if everybody else becomes like that ?
0	much of the blame for this must be laid at our door , because we have neglected them and failed to see the danger
0	that means it had taken place
0	well , you may be right at that
0	besides , in this first letter that dmitry had seen , the man ’ s arrival was only hinted at and the whole letter seemed very vague and high-flown , and was filled with sentimental clichés
0	and she—all her features now contorted—she was about to say something , but before she could utter a word , he suddenly regained his pride
0	obviously because i had sentenced myself to die at five the following morning
0	the privileged creature rejects that priceless gift , fails to appreciate it , does not even like it , sneers at it , and remains unmoved
0	i ’ m all for clever people
0	is there still time for me to make the seven o ’ clock train ?
0	oh , she 's certainly ready to pay the ransom !
0	but i had resolved to become a decent man for the rest of my life when i was struck down by this blow of fate
0	the accumulation must be continuous , without stopping for one single day
0	is it just some wild fantasy or is there a mistake in identity , a quid pro quo , by your grand inquisitor ?
0	he thought in annoyance
0	some of the evidence from secondary witnesses , such as fenya and her mother , seemed to him quite sufficient , and as to perkhotin , dmitry ’ s drinking companions , and the employees of the plotnikov store , they seemed to make the case against dmitry quite overwhelming
0	anna had faced his first assaults with the utmost dignity ( but that was before i came )
0	it was that time in mokroye
0	if someone spoke to him , he would just wave the man away without answering
0	i was in moscow
0	he liked to fill himself with tea
0	for heaven ’ s sake , lise , don ’ t carry on like that or it ’ ll really be the end of me
0	there was a feud between our ancestors
0	although it was through no fault of your own that you knew nothing about the lord when you were a small boy and , envying the pigs their feed , you stole some of it , for which you were beaten , because stealing is very wicked , now you have shed blood and must die
0	we must first of all decide whether this is just a clinical aberration or an ordinary phenomenon affecting many people
0	but snegirev had no idea that kolya krasotkin was also planning to come that day , although he had long been anxious that the boy whom his son seemed to miss so badly should come
0	please , alyosha , won ’ t you see me off ?
0	but since money matters stubbornly stayed out of our conversation , i naturally became furious at my own stupidity and in my irritation i remember answering one of his questions that seemed to me really too flippant by expounding for his benefit my views on women , very heatedly and hardly stopping to take a breath
0	now i ’ m glad it ended the way it did , she said again with the same smile
0	how dare you shove your money at me !
0	what if it should turn out to be brain fever ?
0	well , never mind , respectfully or not , what does it mean ?
0	does that mean again that it ’ s always rewarding to talk to a clever man ?
0	but let 's get down to brass tacks
0	so what are we to believe ?
0	even among the people now , individuals become isolated more and more often , turn into greedy thrifty peasants and village usurers
0	he says it ’ s different
0	but what ’ s all this talk about this not being the right moment , and what ’ s the message you ’ re expecting ?
0	she said she would tried to run away , but they held onto her and would not let her go
0	all that irritated me
0	he did not look in the least offended ; indeed , if anything , he seemed very pleased with himself
0	she was informed that he was well dressed , young , and very polite ( we may add parenthetically that perkhotin was a rather handsome young man and was well aware of it himself )
0	then i saw she was trembling
0	versilov left and the prince saw him politely to the door
0	but you just come out and repeat things somebody happened to tell you
0	put it down , put that icon down , andrei
0	i had deliberately mentioned the shares , but i certainly had no intention of telling vasin about what sergei had confided to me in secret the day before
0	he added somewhat condescendingly , as though to encourage his hesitant visitor
0	you know , here we are laughing , but just think how the accused must feel about it
0	most likely , at that time he did not really know himself why he had come , not being quite sure what it was that was driving him : a peculiar yearning had arisen in his heart , drawing him irresistibly into a new , unknown , but by then inevitable course
0	he started wondering , for instance , why it was that when he had come into the summer house now , he had sat down without thinking in exactly the same spot as the day before , rather than anywhere else
0	and that is not all : how many of those strong enough to be among the chosen have already or will in the future take their mighty minds and ardent hearts away from you and give them to some other cause , in the end raising their free banner against you ?
0	i knew that vasin was now working for a stock company and that he often used to bring work home with him
0	one by one , the other lodgers went back to their rooms , but i stayed at the landlady 's for a long time
0	come , son , that ’ s enough , my boy , he said sympathetically
0	his soul will grow and will see how infinite is the mercy of god and how good men can be !
0	he still could not utter a word
0	i had no doubt about it
0	no , misha , his is a soul in turmoil
0	to cut a long story short , he controls sergei sufficiently , is now pressing him so hard , and has made him lose his sense of honor to such an extent that he 's looking for a way out of his difficulties by marrying anna , because neither of them can see any other way of getting the money
0	they would just come in from their faro room where , as i learned later , they would lost every last kopek they had on them
0	but she too must have been alive once , must not she ?
0	in my thoughts , the doctor told me , i often visualize ecstatically the sacrifices i could make for mankind and , indeed , i might even accept martyrdom for my fellow men if circumstances suddenly demanded it of me
0	in general , rakitin ’ s account seduced the public through the independence of its ideas and the loftiness of its vision
0	so now we must first find out if he really means to buy the lumber and pay eleven thousand rubles for it or if it ’ s just one of his lies
0	well , i guess i ’ ll have to bring perezvon into this too
0	the prosecutor and the examining magistrate were very much impressed by this testimony about the sixth thousand
0	her husband came up to me too and then they all surrounded me , almost hugging and kissing me
0	now karamazov started to look at him again with different eyes
0	his wound , although not fatal , still turned out to be grave enough for him to have to stay in bed for a long time
0	they have no bread , and they ’ re going about begging for their poor , burnt-out village
0	well , never mind , take the hanky too , it 's clean and you can use it
0	what do you know about it ?
0	old as it was , it seemed solid enough to last many years , and the inside was spacious and comfortable
0	but what work could she hope to find around afimievsk except on the cotton mill grounds ?
0	but i was annoyed and ordered that you not be allowed into the house
0	no , but i want one with vanilla , you know—it ’ s specially good for little old men , he-he-he
0	she looked at me and then sat down
0	possibly she had once been an actress , the way she went in for that absurd declaiming and gesturing , per-forming ceaselessly , while now i kept silent
0	but throughout his later life he considered it loathsome that he had listened like that and , deep down in the mysterious recesses of his soul , he knew it was the most despicable thing he had ever done in his life
0	besides , there would have been a point if stepanov had been hurt by me , but since he would already been rehabilitated by the officers of his regiment without my help it was quite unnecessary
0	the prosecutor immediately asked mitya where he had expected to get the twenty-three hundred rubles he had promised the poles on his honor when , according to his present statement , he had only fifteen hundred rubles in the first place
0	wait , i call out to him
0	isn ’ t that suffering , tell me ?
0	whether i am base or noble makes no difference since you are , in either case , as inaccessible as the sun !
0	now that , for the first time in my life , i have acted sincerely , you all look upon me as if i were one of god ’ s fools and , although you like me , you still laugh at me
0	he cried , turning red
0	while he 's in the rut , everything is clear : income , rank , position in society , horse and carriage , wife , etc
0	god will punish you , alyosha said , watching her closely
0	but in the big room the party went on again , louder than ever
0	he was obviously annoyed at my interruption
0	for i wouldn ’ t be here if i were not aware that your interest in her was fatherly , sir
0	of the common people , very few came into the cell , although many gathered at the gates of the hermitage
0	i shouted across the table to a gray-headed , mustachioed , purple-faced gentleman in long tails , who had been placing small sums for hours with unwavering patience and losing stake alter stake
0	if i said something that offended you , please forgive me because , i assure you , i have many more important things on my mind
0	and since he and i are the only ones in the whole world to know about these signals , it ’ s absolutely certain that the master will open the door as soon as he hears the knocks , without asking , who ’ s there ?
0	oh , i know so well that wild heart—wild , yes , but also noble and generous !
0	early that morning , perhaps at eight or so , she would arrived at my—i mean my landlord's—apartment , hoping that the old prince would still be there
0	we are even told the words he mutters as he does so
0	this is typical of the way russian people believe , isn ’ t it ?
0	is that what you ’ re suggesting ?
0	hey , pane , mitya called out to him , let ’ s have a drink together
0	i was almost thinking
0	people could now stand up , stretch their legs , have a snack at the buffet , exchange impressions
0	now semyon is really vicious and he will corrupt them completely , whereas , as long as they were working for me , i always insisted that they behave
0	it must have taken him a long time to get even that far , for he had certainly fainted several times as he crawled , then had regained consciousness and crawled further
0	my former life is over and a new life is just beginning
0	i will certainly be very glad to do so !
0	he ’ s the one who makes me laugh !
0	whenever i ’ ve sunk into the deepest shame of depravity—and that has happened to me more often than anything else—i ’ ve always recited that poem about the goddess ceres and man ’ s fate
0	you know , i begin to think that you have no one in the world but me
0	nevertheless , i ’ m extremely fond of one of those russian boys
0	he started from the point when the accused went to the lady ’ s house with the intention of giving her a beating ( the prosecutor said he was using the accused ’ s own words ) , but , instead of hitting her , he remained at her feet , and that was the beginning of his love
0	so it was with a heavy heart that he awaited the day
0	she ’ s gone to mokroye , sir , to that officer of hers
0	i remember how , after having completed the installations , zverev had patted the sofa tenderly and said to me :
0	indeed , the purer they are , the more forbidden is the subject
0	alyosha , who had never seen them before , did not know what the financial arrangements were
0	at the top of his voice
0	i may also add here the thought that flashed through my head while i was listening to him : i assumed that he loved mother with the abstract , humanitarian love that one feels for mankind as a whole rather than with the simple love that a man must feel for a woman ; so that the moment he met a woman for whom he felt that simple love , he refused to recognize it , probably partly from lack of experience
0	and this is just the point : the constant frantic irritation of the accused was not actually caused by the three thousand rubles ; something else triggered his anger
0	'why , you did not expect that you would stay for the reception and the dance , she kept hissing at me in the carriage , 'and it 's because of you that i could not stay myself
0	this is borne out by medical experience
0	as to the stars , not only have they all been counted , but all their movements have been calculated with an accuracy down to the last second so that it 's possible to predict , say , a thousand years ahead the exact day and time of the appearance of a comet
0	i say one dozen will be plenty !
0	i even heard you tell her to her face that you loved her
0	of course , those words had escaped ivan involuntarily , when he was irritated
0	later , when his father died , lambert left the school , and i had not seen him for two years when i met him in the street one day
0	he also remembered that when someone had once asked him , why do you hate so-and-so so much ?
0	well , that was my answer
0	it was quite impossible to trip him up
0	look , you didn ’ t get it out from under your nails properly ; and now rub your face—right here
0	touchard had suddenly decided that he was not charging enough for me and wrote in a dignified tone that he had sons of princes and senators in his establishment , that it lowered the tone of the school to keep a boy with a family background like mine , and that unless he received an additional—
0	he seemed to be very afraid of something and i suddenly noticed that his hands were trembling
0	first of all , according to the experts , the institution of elder came into existence in our russian monasteries only quite recently , less than a hundred years ago , although it has existed for well over a thousand years throughout the orthodox east , particularly in sinai and on mount athos
0	you see , mr karamazov , nelyudov went on , we ’ ve done everything within our power to help you clear yourself
0	after he had heard mr karamazov ’ s command , shouted at him from the carriage as it was pulling away from the monastery , alyosha stood for a while looking quite lost
0	i never even noticed i was covered with blood , mitya said
0	have mercy upon them all , o lord
0	but , my god , now i ’ m sorry i ever set eyes on that sheet ; i never expected it would carry that sort of rumor !
0	you know , lise , it ’ s horribly painful for a man down on his luck when every person he meets looks at him as if he were his benefactor
0	you see what kind of a man he is , miusov said , turning to the monk
0	why is it her duty ?
0	i hope you do not mind my frankness
0	and although versilov did use such adjectives as petty and selfish about himself , there was still something haughty in his apology , something suggesting a scornful casualness toward the whole business
0	why , if i miss this opportunity , i will never find the answer in all my life
0	i don ’ t think anyone did
0	what i ’ m trying to say is that you so often get involved with all kinds of people , like that other time , with that captain
0	i see you are here , he said , while i have been to your place looking for you
0	mitya listened attentively , asking him to repeat various things , and was pleased
0	in fact , i ’ m terribly sad to lose you
0	my god , and here i am sitting on his lap !
0	he burst out laughing
0	but is he sincere ?
0	at that time the convalescing old prince had shown a propensity to spend money at an alarming rate , almost to scatter it to the winds
0	fenya , did they send that girl again with the letter ?
0	you can ’ t pass by me like that ; you must know there ’ s something that we two clever people have to discuss
0	i ’ ve seen his picture
0	i am just reporting this fact without comment
0	i ’ d give the world for a minute like this one
0	the luncheon can ’ t have even taken place !
0	i suddenly burst out laughing , apologized to them , and , turning to mrs prutkov , added with easy familiarity : all right , ma'am , i take back my statement that you are the bane of my existence
0	he said , suddenly stopping in the doorway
0	maria , who told me all this in moscow , believed both versions
0	he ’ s suddenly started telling me about that katya woman : she ’ s so great and so marvelous and this and that , and she ’ s sent for a doctor from moscow and engaged the most eminent and learned lawyer , the very best there is , to save him , mitya
0	stebelkov said it was you
0	you frightened me , that ’ s what you did , rakitin , grushenka said , and then looked smilingly at alyosha
0	now , if ivan loved him too , i ’ d be afraid for my life
0	alyosha asked in alarm
0	but there is , alas , another version—one , indeed , that kraft accepted , that i had heard before , and that i believed to be true too
0	there are three forces , only three , on this earth that can overcome and capture once and for all the conscience of these feeble , undisciplined creatures , so as to give them happiness
0	you can get one like that at a jeweler 's for sixteen rubles
0	but it ca not be done , you little idiot ; it 's impossible now , and that 's just the trouble
0	katerina has never loved me
0	what does that mean—you can not accept his world ?
0	alyosha , please don ’ t despise me for this , and if it is really an awful thing to do and if it annoys you very much , forgive me please
0	anyway , yesterday i proposed to you and i beg you to forgive me for that
0	on the bed on the left was a heap of pillows in black calico cases , each smaller than the next
0	i ’ m very worried—she ’ s still unconscious
0	not directly , alyosha said
0	i don ’ t want to set eyes on our house anymore or on our things , i don ’ t want to see any of it again
0	paisii watched him intently
0	but no one would have been able to establish any motive , for everybody knew that he was liked by his master and felt honored by the trust his master had in him
0	vasin 's face did not really strike me particularly , although he had the reputation of being a remarkably intelligent man
0	he didn ’ t like leaving her in that state , but he was in a hurry
0	the sudden change in her took place literally in a flash and it completely stunned alyosha
0	ah , so here you are , at last !
0	ivan shouted , banging his fist on the table
0	but i want you to know that all the time i was carrying that money on me , i kept saying to myself , no , dmitry karamazov , you may still prove that you ’ re not really a thief !
0	yes , that ’ s true , absolutely true , and although i tried to win him over by my love , my limitless love—i was even willing to forgive him his betrayal—he didn ’ t understand anything at all !
0	every time i entered a new school or met people who , being my elders , had to be treated with respect—and that means every lousy teacher , every tutor , every village priest—every single one of them would , upon asking my name and being told it was dolgoruky , for some reason invariably add : prince dolgoruky ?
0	so she took me by the hand , led me away , washed my face and hands , made me change my underwear and my shirt , pomaded and even curled my hair
0	ivan asked gruffly in a stern voice , trying hard to keep himself under control and suddenly realizing with enormous self-disgust that he was immediately curious to know how he could have displeased this flunkey and that he would not move away before he had satisfied his curiosity
0	but even supposing they may be right from their ignoble point of view , even so who of them would dare to condemn me ?
0	if you have heard him talk , you must know him , you must !
0	then i told him straight out that i would heard the big news and that i was very happy for him
0	even toward the end of zosima ’ s life , there were monks who hated and envied him , but there were fewer and fewer of them , and they kept their feelings to themselves , although some occupied important positions in the monastery
0	prince , anna said , raising her voice , now you are insulting me and allowing these people to insult me !
0	she was terribly excited
0	no , no , that 's not what i meant
0	all dressed up , mitya thought
0	did you really think about me too ?
0	well , not really , but still
0	yes , i concede , it may be a triumph of vulgarity , require no talent , and suit a mediocrity , but there can hardly be any impotence in this case
0	now i can feel your eyes on me and i know that it 's my son who 's looking at me
0	we are preserving the image of christ—may that image shine like a precious diamond over the world
0	in fact , i will do what i can to— but tell me , what about you ?
0	until thirty , though , it ’ s all right
0	can it really be true that you came only for the chosen few ?
0	well , there 's nothing so special about the scene , nothing much to it really , but you will never forget it as long as you live , and it has survived throughout the whole of europe
0	blessed is the man who has his own ideal of beauty , even if it be a wrong ideal !
0	oh , tell me about that too , tell me about mother !
0	in russia he would already been involved in a scandal—something to do with forgery of shares
0	yes , precisely for you , rakitin said with a grin
0	a cold and sickly sweat broke out on his forehead and on his temples
0	about six months before he was to die ( he was already seventeen at the time ) he started visiting a man who led a very isolated life in our town , a man who had been exiled from moscow for what amounted to free-thinking
0	he roared madly , drawing himself up in his chair as though preparing to pounce on me
0	i don ’ t see , though , why it should concern you
0	didn ’ t you often tell them then that you wanted to make them free
0	i remember you up to the age of eleven
0	after their mother ’ s death , the fate of the two little boys was a repetition of their older brother mitya ’ s
0	he pushed me
0	besides , i think he ’ s sick now
0	but they were part of something continuous , of a greater whole , of something solid and very satisfying
0	fenya , bring some pies , too , and see that they ’ re hot
0	he didn ’ t answer and was ready to burst into tears
0	( with less than a rothschild-size fortune , however , i realize it would be very difficult to do )
0	and , as usual , he was ready with his answer and delivered it in his calm , restrained tone , while the expression on his face seemed to say , all right , if you want to bring it out in the open , i ’ ll meet you there too !
0	but they only laughed
0	otherwise every man thinks he can do everything and wants to astonish the whole world and i would be the worst of them all perhaps if i had the skill to do it
0	i could not face that and so finally i managed to muster up enough courage—or perhaps despair—to do what i have now done
0	your mummy may be here before me , because it ’ s high time she was back too
0	the papa is delighted that the twigs he uses to flog the child have knots in them
0	i don ’ t suppose one little glass will kill me
0	how am i to understand that ?
0	look at the worldly , at those who set themselves above the people of god—have they not distorted the image of god and his truth ?
0	he kept silent , wouldn ’ t talk to me
0	otherwise , for instance , you could have put an end to that terrible torment , which lasted almost a month , by returning the fifteen hundred rubles to the person who had entrusted you with the money , and then , having explained to her the terrible situation you were in , as you described it to us , you could have done the most natural thing , that would occur to anyone—namely , after having acknowledged your mistake , to ask her to lend you that same sum
0	i have the documents to prove it !
0	andrei shouted , pointing ahead with his whip
0	i would appreciate it if you would never make me such an offer again , i cut in
0	plastunov glanced worriedly at dmitry but obeyed at once
0	she ’ s getting what she deserves
0	along two of the walls were beds covered with knitted blankets
0	how can their being in hell put things right ?
0	the policeman , apparently a reasonable man with a distaste for street incidents caused by citizens ' irritability , seemed to be on his side , at least to some extent
0	in fact , they consist largely of formalized reports of very commonplace interest , along with the most impersonal expression of feelings , if one can express feelings at all that way
0	i made a mistake in thinking that even a man like fyodor karamazov would understand his obligations when received by a highly respectable person
0	but when the author dares to declare that the foundations he mentions—some of which were noted by father joseph a few moments ago—are natural , immutable , and eternal , he thereby goes directly against the church and its sacred mission , preordained from time immemorial
0	do not be like that , my friends , for you do not really think i am afraid to die , do you ?
0	what can you like me for ?
0	i would even fixed the day when i would leave
0	but the right word for it , i think , is stolen
0	his impatience boiled up in him and suddenly he made up his mind
0	explain it to me once more
0	but he never reforms—again , i am probably just the same in that respect
0	that , i remember , mother said
0	now he gets offended at being asked such a trivial question and becomes genuinely angry
0	it would have cost you nothing to do it that way
0	but nelyudov returned with a man who handed mitya some strange clothes
0	she sees the sinners being tortured
0	but what it really amounts to is that you ’ re angry with your god today—it ’ s as though there had been unfair discrimination and the right man had not got his promotion or his name was left off the new year ’ s list of honors
0	tatyana growled , and then , pointing at me , she said to makar : how did you find him , my dear man ?
0	but never mind , i do not give a damn about you
0	but after the governor was gone , lizaveta was again to be seen around town wearing nothing but her smock , just as before
0	that ’ s exactly what it was !
0	can you explain now ?
0	it was said—and andronikov is supposed to have heard this from katerina 's own mouth—that , when he had learned of the young girl 's feelings for him , versilov himself had offered his love to the stepmother
0	i hated you as though you were the cause of it all , as though everything had happened through your fault
0	in the second place , i also will not speak of adults at the moment , because , besides being disgusting and undeserving of love , they have something to compensate them for their suffering : they have eaten their apple of knowledge , they know about good and evil and are like gods themselves
0	of course , i am
0	i am sorry to disappoint the reader straightaway , sorry , but at the same time i feel like laughing
0	but the gentle father joseph ’ s words were wasted on them and even met with sarcastic rejoinders
0	he may be right—you ’ ve lost enough as is , grushenka said with a peculiar intonation in her voice
0	gives the insects sensual lust ,
0	you know , i like him very much at times
0	let me note too that , after her first surprise and curiosity about makar 's presence in the house , lisa somehow began to treat him almost condescendingly , i might even say scornfully
0	i was placing my stakes , standing behind the table
0	of course , the police and the legal authorities could not ignore the confession altogether and had to start a criminal investigation , but it was soon dropped on the grounds that even if the evidence presented—the letters and other articles—could be proved authentic , it would still not be sufficient for a conviction
0	nelyudov asked with gentle insistence
0	here is what i have been thinking about and what i have decided : if i were to escape , and even if it were with money and a passport , and i managed to get as far away as america , what cheers me is the thought that what i ’ d find there would not be joy and happiness , but something that might be even worse than hard labor in siberia
0	but if you don ’ t forgive me , it won ’ t really make much difference now , because nothing really makes any difference anymore
0	on top of everything , both his hands were caked with blood
0	at first he seemed grateful , but then he cheered up and became genuinely amused
0	he really had to keep his ears open now
0	but the door was closed , there were people with you , discussing business matters
0	well , he kept it all right
0	it was they who attacked me and who used abusive language , much worse than anything i used : they said i was a nasty little brat and that i ought to be sent to bed without dinner that night ; also that i was a nihilist , that they would call the police , that i was pestering them because they were weak , helpless women but that if there had been a man with them , i would have immediately put my tail between my legs like a puppy who would been spanked
0	i still remember how impressed i was by how gorgeously she was dressed in green silk
0	i found you sincere
0	as he was praying now , he chanced to feel in his pocket the little envelope that the maid had given him after he had left katerina ’ s house
0	i want to get completely drunk , just like the time we got to know each other , mitya , remember ?
0	as soon as he recovered and could answer our questions , he declared most categorically that when he walked out onto the porch of the servants ’ cottage , he heard a noise and decided to enter the garden through the gate , which had been left unlocked
0	as i walked in , i tried hard to control myself
0	the prosecutor then described in great detail mitya ’ s efforts to obtain the money he needed and thus avoid killing his father
0	he presented the whole tragedy of the accused and of the crime as a product of outdated mores surviving from the days of serfdom and of the chaos prevailing in russia because of the lack of proper social organization and adequate public services
0	i spat in pan mitya ’ s face
0	fyodor karamazov immediately busied himself with preparations for the journey to petersburg , and perhaps he would have gone , although he certainly had no idea what he would do there
0	who put this pillow under my head ?
0	no one at all , ever
0	but our father has no wish to tear the cup from his lips
0	about once a week she went home , that is , to the house of her late father ’ s employers , and in cold winters she went there to sleep almost every night , either in the entrance hall or in the cowshed
0	also , no doubt , out of sheer enthusiasm
0	so the case is going to be heard today , is it !
0	it was just after one
0	and so on and so forth
0	our conversation did not last long and he soon started promising me money , a goodly sum , a goodly sum , just for your cooperation , just so that you see to it that prince sergei goes to see prince nikolai
0	then god will send you happiness
0	take that white one out of his hand and give it to me !
0	he was praying fervently , whispering wildly to himself :
0	but i prayed very quickly since i was in a great hurry
0	ivan saw at once from smerdyakov ’ s appearance that he had completely recovered from his illness : his face was much fresher and fuller , his forelock was carefully brushed up in the middle of his forehead , as in the old days , and the hair at his temples was neatly combed back
0	so you imagine i will accept money from him ?
0	i would found out about their situation while i was still in moscow , but i never expected things to be that bad
0	he simply must have got a bit mixed up
0	what makes me furious is that versilov never bothers to correct you when you refer to people so humbly , because he 's so full of himself und cares nothing about any of us
0	mother is sitting by his bed
0	i thought they must be other lodgers
0	i said , pointing at the poor old man
0	he was very pleased with himself as he uttered the final words of his speech
0	do not be offended if people treat you badly
0	cher enfant , i always felt that one way or another we would get to understand each other some day
0	and then one day , in a restaurant in the presence of several army officers , he suddenly declares : i have decided to have pheasant
0	i asked for a corner with just enough room to turn round in and they told me scornfully that if that 's what i was looking for i would have a better chance in a flophouse
0	suicide is man 's greatest sin , he said with a sigh , but god alone can judge it , for only god knows what and how much a man can bear
0	those were the thoughts going through my head as i sat in that tavern
0	he stopped visiting her house , but then one night , taking advantage of his familiarity with the layout of the place , he entered the house through the garden and by the roof , with reckless disregard for the risk of being caught
0	a double on the seven !
0	he walks to the door , opens it , and says to him , go now , and do not come back
0	true , there was a dominant feeling among these that exerted tremendous pressure on me in propelling me in one direction
0	but why is it only a very ordinary sin ’ ?
0	that 's the kind of business i own
0	in the meantime , however , consider this : we have perhaps several dozen witnesses to testify that you yourself went around telling people , even shouting from the roof-tops , that you ’ d gone through three thousand rubles on that spree , and it was always three thousand , never fifteen hundred
0	god bless you , little man , grow and be happy , dear childl
0	did you know that that no-good dmitry wants to marry her ?
0	he says it to prepare me for what is to come
0	as we parted , vasin thanked me once more
0	you want to know how i managed to get hold of all this information ?
0	and if you are not , i ’ ll have to jump in the lake this very day
0	i can see by your face that now you are being sincere again
0	i do not doubt now that there is such a thing as fate !
0	and that ’ s how the best , the nicest of them , act !
0	he said this aloud and all of a sudden dashed to the fence , climbed over it , and started to run
0	knowing he was an illegitimate son of fyodor karamazov—and we have evidence that he knew it—smerdyakov was bitter about his position as compared with that of fyodor karamazov ’ s legitimate sons , who , he felt , had everything while he had nothing , who would inherit their father ’ s money while he , smerdyakov , was doomed to remain a cook all his life
0	but what this shameful and distasteful feeling within me was , i could not explain
0	smerdyakov killed him on my instructions
0	and how often have i blamed myself for nothing !
0	he was , in fact , quite furious with himself all the way to the lady ’ s house , but he repeated to himself about ten times : i ’ ll go through with it , happen what may !
0	n'est-ce pas , cher enfant ?
0	'if you are interested , come over and we will discuss it
0	a little way before he reached maria kondratiev ’ s house , ivan met a short peasant wearing a warm but patched coat , who was zigzagging drunkenly , grumbling and swearing
0	however , the otherwise weak-willed old man , with whom one could do anything , now categorically refused to break his promise to marry anna , who actually had taken the initiative of proposing to him
0	be generous , o man !
0	so you will move it away , will you ?
0	besides , he has plenty of time to change his mind and , by then , ivan will have recovered and will take charge of everything , and i ’ ll be out of it altogether
0	he seems to be a very respectable fellow
0	i saw a lap-dog just like this one when i was in the army , mitya said dreamily , only one of its hind legs had been broken
0	one more important point : was versilov aware of what was afoot at that time ?
0	my reasoning went like this : the letter about the inheritance that i had in my possession was a matter of conscience ; by entrusting to vasin 's judgment the decision as to what i should do about it , i was showing him how deeply i respected him , which was bound to flatter him
0	in brief , he hopes and intends to make amends for everything , begs you for your blessing , and beseeches you to forget what has happened
0	what an inspired idea !
0	go away , leave me , all of you , and i hope i never see you again
0	i took the money out of my pocket and held it out to her
0	but what if , in reality , things were entirely different , and what if the accused is not at all like the character in the novel made up by the prosecutor ?
0	and the second thing i must tell you is that i won ’ t try to worm any secret out of him ; if he tells me of his own accord , i ’ ll tell him that i ’ ve promised to tell you about it , and then i ’ ll come here and tell you
0	when i come from a visit to you , i feel purified and it makes me feel a better person than i really am
0	allow me to have this written down , the prosecutor said
0	once , when they were abroad and she was in a laughing mood , she did say to sergei that perhaps , in the future , who knows
0	when father varsonofy died , not only was there no smell of decay , there was even a decided aroma of flowers from his body , they repeated with malicious insistence , but it was not because he had been an elder that he deserved it , but because he was a righteous man
0	you were literally swaying so that i thought you were on the verge of fainting
0	all right , i won ’ t go into it either , but i will allow myself to remark that if a person as respectable and honorable as miss verkhovtsev suddenly decides to change her testimony , as she did with the obvious intention of ruining the accused , she can not be considered a cool , impartial , and detached witness
0	father paisii raised his eyes from the gospels and glanced at alyosha , but then he quickly lowered them to his book again , realizing that something strange was happening to the youth
0	and after that , he came to see me almost every evening
0	can a spider hate the fly he 's preparing to snare ?
0	to that i answer that precisely the fact that , with what they found on him , they could only account for fifteen hundred rubles , not for the three thousand he was supposed to have stolen , suggests that the money had come from somewhere else , that it had never been sealed in that envelope
0	but tell me , do you really belong to that group ?
0	i was waiting—i thought you ’ d call me
0	i would like to whip those orphans !
0	he must be thinking i ’ m trying hard to get his approval , kolya decided
0	i was waiting for you anxiously today , you , lisa 's brother , so i could tell you everything she does not know : i am a common criminal , for i have taken part in the forgery of railway shares
0	mitya nodded his head , repeating in an undertone to his counsel , all right , all right , i won ’ t do it again
0	mikhail rakitin came in and he showed me a short poem he ’ d written about my sore foot
0	but however much you may disapprove , my dear karl von moor , i ’ m still determined to take alyosha out of the monastery , he announced
0	then the baiting by the boys would start all over again
0	all right then , look at it now and you will see that scientists will soon explain all the mysteries of god without leaving a single one to you and me
0	and i am magnanimous
0	that 's always how it is when the heart is too full
0	the boy cried nervously
0	i remember one of my teachers commenting that i was filled with the justified resentment of a citizen whose civil rights had been violated , but he was the only one of that opinion
0	i set off for home
0	he thinks that will make ilyusha feel better , but i doubt it
0	he had told me three days before about the idea of an escape and , for the three days that followed , we kept quarreling
0	he said , baring his teeth in a grin
0	a thick coil of dark brown hair suddenly escaped from under her cap and slipped onto her shoulder , but she paid no attention to it and made no attempt to put it back in place ; she gazed intently at her visitors until she made out who they were
0	for the once in i do not know how many weeks that i come here to dinner , it 's just my luck to find lisa in such a gloomy mood !
0	but what did it all come to ?
0	being a well-bred and sincerely decent man , miusov underwent a rapid process of self-examination , as he entered the father superior ’ s rooms with ivan , as a result of which he grew ashamed of having lost his temper
0	i ’ ve just come to town , he says , and i want to thank you now for the pound of nuts you once gave me , because you ’ re the only person who has ever given me a pound of nuts in my whole life !
0	so , then , you wo not interfere , will you ?
0	on the other hand , from other sources , i know that versilov had a tremendous influence on katerina at first and that their relations deteriorated gradually until they reached the final breaking point
0	also there were expensive rugs , carved wood , and pieces of sculpture
0	when i left dergachev's—god knows why i went there at all—i latched onto vasin and started praising him in an outburst of enthusiasm
0	if only you people knew how important it is to me—i ’ m really getting desperate !
0	i admit such offers have been made me , but i turned them down
0	i leaped to my feet
0	as he remembered it later , he sat there quite terrified during that first second , while smerdyakov stood in front of him , his hands behind his back , looking at him with complete self-assurance , indeed with a certain sternness
0	they go so far as to declare in print—i have read such statements myself—that they can no longer interpret the holy scriptures to people because they are so poor and that if lutherans or heretics come to take their flocks away from them—then , let them , for we are not properly paid
0	i could not help reproaching myself a little for what seemed to me now the smugness and even condescension with which i would listened the night before to certain passages of his confession
0	and he grabbed me by the arm
0	those words of yours , balaam ’ s ass , are worth their weight in gold , and i ’ ll see to it that you get a gold piece today
0	so let ’ s drink to life , brother , for what can be more precious than life ?
0	ah , what fool i am to have shed so many tears during these five years , a shameless fool
0	how , how could he have just dismissed him from his mind ?
0	ivan said in surprise and suddenly felt a real wave of fear creep up his spine
0	and i sometimes wondered whether he did not come to see me simply because he had no one else to talk to
0	it had snowed lightly during the night and a sharp , dry wind was raising a snowy powder and sweeping it along the town ’ s bleak streets and all across market square
0	mitya noticed this and shuddered
0	you don ’ t understand , do you ?
0	i wound up my lengthy tirade rather incoherently
0	after all , how could he know , when he was trampling the bills , that i ’ d bring them back to him again the next day ?
0	he could listen with the tender attention of a woman
0	lambert 's voice was very loud
0	of course , i was aware of it
0	just before reaching it , he remembered his father ’ s insistence that he slip into the house unseen by ivan
0	you have enough money of your own now and they ’ ll say you just took it out of your cashbox
0	i have enough will power to stop whenever i decide
0	i heard he was on his way , but isn ’ t he still pretty far away ?
0	for god ’ s sake , man , this is no joke , understand !
0	i am not sure , however , whether his intelligence is really
0	perhaps i was completely wrong when i decided to write this : there 's so much more left inside me beyond what comes out in words
0	trust to what your heart will tell you ,
0	at three o'clock i suddenly came to my senses
0	we are too vicious , my good woman , both of us , and we ’ re both past the niceties of forgiveness
0	isn ’ t that the truth ?
0	i definitely decided to go straight back and give versilov the letter about the inheritance without any explanation ; i would pack my belongings in my suitcase , make a bundle out of the rest , and move to a hotel for the night
0	please believe me
0	if you would only listen to me for half a minute , madam , i ’ d explain everything to you , perkhotin said firmly
0	but what i said is the truth , you understand , the truth !
0	listen , that landlord , whatever his name is , is not he a doctor ?
0	you ’ ve got it right , father paisii said
0	i was sitting in an armchair while he walked up and down the room
0	i ’ ll explain it to you later
0	all that 's just blabber
0	arkady darling , go and catch him !
0	and ilyusha ’ s bed is still there
0	people are more and more moved by envy now , by the desire to satisfy their material greed , and by vanity
0	the three thousand that you promised
0	before that , he was quite gay and cheerful
0	i am sure you wo not understand what i mean , lambert , when i tell you that i will listen to your proposition because of my 'breadth , i declared in a steady voice , and he at once filled up my glass
0	she added with indignation , looking at him challengingly
0	this seemed most unlikely to me
0	alyosha did not answer
0	you must remember that
0	you know what , i have some salami in my pocket , which i picked up in town just in case i got hungry on my way here
0	no , wait , you would better not drink any more
0	the little pole began , turning to grushenka , his face crimson with anger
0	but he bent down and kissed me on the cheek
0	well , after all , let 's say that i am his son , although my name is dolgoruky , but that 's because i am illegitimate
0	i think we ’ ve lost touch with the people—that ’ s an axiom of mine
0	look , ilyusha , mr krasotkin has come to see you
0	he died last night , and imagine
0	i don ’ t trust them
0	there was one story especially , about how he ’ d cured a paralyzed lady : if my legs didn ’ t ache so , he says , i ’ d show you a dance you ’ ve never seen before
0	i ’ m perfectly capable of answering your questions !
0	if he had sufficient scruples to worry that someone might be blamed for his own death , did he then run out of scruples so completely as to allow an innocent man to be blamed for the death of his former master ?
0	i respect your brother !
0	i shouted , as though i would suddenly discovered the answer to everything
0	and ask him whether he likes bath-house back-scrubbers , tousled ones
0	please , prince , have your tea , and if you would allow me , i would like to have a cup with you
0	he was a tall , spare man with very long , lean legs and very long , pale fingers
0	and as you learn to love them more and more , you will be more and more convinced of the existence of god and of the immortality of your soul
0	they had a complete explanation and , whatever speculation there may have been on that subject , it 's all finished now !
0	so this is my whole idea , for the rest is just details
0	the other is very ill , and his life is in danger
0	and it turned out that they did because :
0	ivan all of a sudden became very angry
0	i ’ m on the bottom rung while you ’ re much higher up , perhaps on the thirteenth rung
0	i tell you , the old doctor who could cure you of every illness has all but vanished and you find nothing but specialists these days , and they even advertise in the newspapers
0	and what about a drink ?
0	i greatly appreciate your willingness to cooperate
0	after spending nine days totally unconscious , i came back to myself quite regenerated but not at all reformed
0	it wasn ’ t sorrow , it was human happiness that christ extolled , and the first miracle he worked was to bring men happiness
0	tomorrow , i ’ ll try to raise the money from everyone i can think of , but if i can ’ t get it from them , i give you my word i ’ ll go to see my father , smash his head in , and take the money from under his pillow , provided only that ivan has left by then
0	well , i admit he pulled it off quite effectively
0	i understood that , but the trouble was that lambert finally understood it too
0	i don ’ t know whether you are , misha , but i certainly am not
0	alyosha hesitated for a second
0	tell me this now : is it the same sokolsky that versilov is having that lawsuit with about the inheritance ?
0	in short , mitya was told that , from then on , he was a prisoner and would be taken at once to town to be locked up in a rather unpleasant establishment
0	the question of whether this was miraculous healing or natural recovery never even occurred to alyosha , for he had complete faith in the spiritual power of his teacher , whose glory he felt as his own personal triumph
0	from there , i went to mother 's , both to see her and in the hope of finding mrs prutkov there
0	intelligence is crooked , while stupidity is honest
0	the audience was excited , electrified by the scenes and the outbursts that had just taken place , and they were anxiously awaiting the conclusion of the show—the summations of the prosecutor and the defense counsel , and then the verdict
0	so i would let society distribute my wealth , while i myself would melt into the crowd and dissolve into mediocrity once more !
0	the prince bared his teeth in a grin
0	he was one of the prominent personalities of our town
0	i certainly never expected to talk to you again
0	i have used the phrase devote myself to my idea because it expresses my main purpose in life
0	another of the daughters of this former peasant was married to some pen-pusher who had worked his way up to become a petty government official ; and now , in one of the rooms of the guest house , one could see among the family photographs exhibited on the wall a picture of the official in his dress uniform , epaulets and all
0	i have no wish to insult you because you look like an honest woman , and i suppose that 's your daughter over there
0	his heart contracted painfully
0	i ’ m sure that , if it hadn ’ t been for all these little obstacles , we would have already come to an understanding
0	but i came to my senses and refused to serve a mad cause
0	turn them into loaves of bread and men will follow you like cattle , grateful and docile , although constantly fearful lest you withdraw your hand and they lose your loaves
0	it 's very hard to understand what actually makes people laugh
0	it 's such an ungrateful task , and it can have no beauty of form
0	and suddenly i saw my whole situation in its true light : what was i about to do now ?
0	i suppose if you get unbearably bored you could perhaps try loving someone or even just getting attached to something or other
0	o lord , have you not performed miracles to save sinners as bad as me before ?
0	of his jealousy , mitya spoke excitedly and at great length and , although he felt inwardly that it was rather humiliating to expose his intimate feelings to public scrutiny , he overcame his reluctance in order to make his account as true as possible
0	after a brief conference among the judges , they ordered that ivan ’ s testimony , as well as katerina ’ s unscheduled additional evidence , be entered in the record and that the trial be resumed
0	no one knows about this letter
0	when they called him in , kalganov complied reluctantly , looked sullen and peevish , and spoke to the prosecutor and the examining magistrate as if he were seeing them for the first time in his life , although in fact they were old acquaintances whom he met almost every day
0	i believed he ’ d love me , unclean as i am , love me truly , not just like an animal
0	the mere fact that he is a papa ( and not necessarily a german papa ) —that he has a family , that he lives like everybody else , that he has expenses and obligations like any other man—is enough to make it impossible for him to become a rothschild and dooms him to mediocrity
0	it was when he was waiting so impatiently for mother to arrive that katerina akhmakov appeared on the scene
0	there will be no trace of my disgrace left anywhere , except in my heart , where the scars will remain forever
0	well , we will see how suitable he turns out to be
0	if he hadn ’ t killed him , i wouldn ’ t have dared to take the money , of course , and it would have stayed where it was
0	an attendant hurried up to dmitry
0	take it—ta-ake it for heaven 's sake
0	if he didn ’ t write such things , i understand he said them
0	indeed , you ’ ll come hurrying all the way from siberia to see me , to share some of your happiness with me !
0	of course , you may not be telling me the truth to make it easier for me because you have such marvelous manners
0	so you go to paris
0	it 's even vexing , is not it ?
0	and the other one—the little , good-looking fellow—he 's the son of a general , but his family is ashamed of him and i was the one who got him off the hook when he was arrested
0	obviously , i am very surprised , indeed , quite stunned
0	all right , so go and get married , but i still say you are a little twerp and you have a long way to go before you are a man
0	and , you know , he used to wear chains
0	i will bring him here , lambert
0	and my soul will remain completely my own
0	i examined the envelope hoping to find some penciled note , some sign , but found nothing
0	the fact that maria , who was , i suppose , in her way a sort of romantic and who had been entrusted with the document , had decided to give the letter to me was , on her part , a decision based on reasons that i do not feel it necessary to explain here , although i may later if i see a point to it
0	the father was terribly happy when we came
0	kolya then picked up the cannon from the floor and presented it to ilyusha , together with the supply of powder and the shot
0	katerina rose from her seat , staring at ivan in horror
0	he said , holding it up for everyone to see
0	i can not remember in proper order what happened then , because i myself was terribly agitated and was in no state to observe developments properly
0	she suddenly lifted her frail little hand and , with breathtaking dexterity , delivered a resounding slap on my companion 's face
0	he asked the teacher
0	he got down and walked into the yard
0	when he spoke to people now , he used only decent words and even his voice was different
0	and the more he insults you , the more you ’ ll love him
0	indeed , they are dearer to us than to them , the natives of those lands
0	i slipped my feet into my slippers , put on my dressing gown , and went straight to the room where makar was
0	he always answered me readily enough and to the point , but it invariably ended in abstract constructions and aphorisms so that i could never extract anything personal from him
0	he explained to me how he had planned it all and where he had got the necessary information , but i ’ ll tell you about all that later
0	karamazov exclaimed hysterically , forcing tears from his eyes
0	why , do you have a message for him ?
0	but i do not see these differences as long as they do not concern me
0	gradually , i found some sort of explanation
0	no , it was not yesterday
0	after her tragedy , she would received a great deal of sympathy from all of us , especially from my mother and tatyana prutkov ; however , once she would been installed in mrs stolbeyev 's apartment , everybody had begun to neglect her , except perhaps lisa , who often went to visit her
0	i did not remember his coming in
0	for a moment that idea took complete possession of my thoughts and feelings , but very quickly i chased it away : if i lay my head on the railroad track , tomorrow they would say i did it because i would stolen and was ashamed of it
0	take my word for it—he ’ ll go along with the escape plan
0	his stabbing his only true friend and his protector with a penknife was the bitterest of all the bitter memories of school that teemed in ilyusha ’ s head
0	however , he had not killed him , precisely because his mother had interceded for him , and so he was not guilty of spilling his father ’ s blood
0	she turned red , wounded in her very insolence , so to speak
0	that same brother of mine , dmitry , has also insulted his fiancée , a highly respectable girl of whom you may have heard
0	mitya tried to interfere
0	mitya ’ s head was resting on her breast
0	and that is exactly what we have done
0	i want you to know , my dear friend , that i am capable of appreciating your devotion to me and am eternally grateful to you for it
0	it was for the sake of this money that my father was killed
0	she has never been so sincerely sorry after laughing at me
0	soon after my duel , still wearing my officer ’ s uniform , i spoke in various houses in town about my views on servants
0	everybody knew that the trial had aroused great interest among the general public , that people could hardly wait for it to begin , that everyone in town had been talking , conjecturing , exclaiming , and making surmises about the trial for the past two months
0	but can ’ t you help it ?
0	mais brisons-la , mon cher
0	the whispering grew louder and more distinct
0	he recognized me and hurried over to me
0	mitya rushed up to him
0	that ’ s why i ’ m carrying on , mr miusov , to be good company , you know , although there are times when i don ’ t really know myself why i do it
0	i won ’ t be able to stand his looking at me
0	of course , the principal beneficiaries are those who have no conscience at all and so obviously can not be tormented by guilt
0	do me this favor , my boy , stop at chermashnya on your way
0	oh , i no longer have the strength to leave now !
0	my mind was already made up
0	oh no , you certainly could not have seen me there !
0	for i do not believe there can be anyone more wretched than they
0	was sergei here again just now ?
0	so we go there , and the ispravnik appears , and he turns out to be a big , fat fellow with blondish hair and an unsmiling face—the most dangerous type in such cases—it ’ s their livers , you see , their livers
0	how dare you drag miss anna versilov into all this ?
0	wait , wait , alyosha interrupted him anxiously
0	in fact , it was more than an impression , it was a shock
0	and alyosha told , very excitedly , like someone who unexpectedly sees clearly something that has been obscure to him until then , how during their last meeting mitya had struck his breast—the upper part of his breast—saying that he had there what was necessary for him to restore his honor
0	another thing , karamazov—tell me , what sort of a man is his father ?
0	well , i was told that two days ago he was belaboring me for all he was worth at katerina ’ s
0	oh , i do not mean the age difference—that 's quite unimportant , that 's nothing—but
0	alyosha hurried to the municipal hospital , to which they had transferred mitya the day after the trial , when he became ill with a nervous fever
0	but i ’ m sure that life will follow its proper course in the end : the worthy man will occupy his rightful place and the unworthy one will vanish in some dark alley and never be heard of again
0	talk to him , scribble me a couple of lines , give the note to the priest , and he ’ ll see to it that i get your message in no time
0	arkasha , darling , forgive me , dear , but how could i not tell
0	for some reason he imagined i was some sort of revolutionary and thought he was being very subtle
0	the disgrace lies not in the fifteen hundred rubles , mitya said firmly , but in the fact that i had put them aside from the three thousand
0	but it 's possible that he was simply acting out of charity
0	perezvon rushed after him and they both disappeared
0	they were talking about the russian aristocracy
0	no , i did not attend her
0	it 's great to love passionately , to love with all the generosity that exists in a man and of which a woman is incapable , but it 's also great to be able to bully her
0	she spoke in a jangling , suffocating voice , so that the word preferable came out as prefe-a-able , with the middle a syllable bleated out as if by a sheep
0	suppose i walk along the nevsky prospect and i observe on the opposite sidewalk a gentleman whose character i would like to investigate
0	the weeping , humiliated , heartbroken girl had suddenly turned into a strong , self-possessed woman , in full control of the situation and pleased with the news she had just heard
0	perkhotin cried again , gazing wildly at dmitry
0	not to anybody , but above all not to you
0	he was perhaps the only man in the world , besides the prosecutor himself , to be convinced of the man ’ s extraordinary psychological endowments and oratorical talents , and he shared his conviction that he had not been properly appreciated by his superiors
0	i looked at her and she seemed to be looking back at me in the darkness , without moving
0	he came from a family of landed gentry , and as a very young man he had been in the army , serving as an officer in the caucasus
0	tell me , were we right in preaching and acting as we did ?
0	so the expectations have come true , after all !
0	alyosha dear , let ’ s not quarrel from the very beginning
0	and everything was later carried out according to this plan offered to us in writing , the prosecution claims
0	anything new that you might reveal to them now would encroach upon the freedom of their faith , for it would come to them as a miracle , and fifteen centuries ago it was freely given faith that was most important to you
0	just like you , at school , i never liked other boys
0	i readily promised that i would stay until evening and that i would do my best to distract him when he awakened
0	mitya listened to them attentively , then simply shrugged
0	but why are you giving it to me , since that was what you killed him for ?
0	mother was busy doing something upstairs and did not come down when the woman arrived , so daria and i were all alone
0	the elder had awakened and , although he felt extremely weak , had asked to be moved from his bed to the armchair
0	nevertheless i felt good
0	i could have undone the clasps , taken the album out of the case , and leafed through it
0	i came to luga with despair in my heart and for some reason stayed at mrs stolbeyev 's , probably hoping to find solitude there
0	i repeat , i would never seen him in such a tense state , although his face was all brightness and gaiety
0	and you knew only too well that your act would be recorded in books , that it would reach the remotest corners of the earth and be passed on down to the end of time
0	the innkeeper trifon appeared at the top of the steps
0	i believe my teeth were chattering
0	but instead of exultation , everything inside him grew suddenly dark and a deep despair , such as he had never known before , enveloped his heart
0	let us only bear in mind that he was one of our contemporary fathers , and i hope the public will not be too offended if i suggest that there are many such fathers today
0	again , one hundred and forty half-imperials were counted out to me
0	he 's as stupid as his own big toe and is only interested in getting that thirty thousand rubles with my help , but nevertheless he 's the only friend i have
0	he ’ s not a local man and he ’ s not in town at the moment
0	what ’ s this new puppy you have ?
0	the other five boys , who were betting with him , waited in the bushes around the embankment , their hearts pounding with apprehension and remorse
0	but i don ’ t believe katerina has anything to do with it at all ; i think their secret is about something completely different
0	how long have they been here ?
0	and now i must explain briefly why they let me off so easily
0	the most tangible reason for my visit was , of course , that letter again , but my sudden overwhelming impulse to go and see her must have been due to other causes that i still can not quite explain—they had to do with the obscure remarks i would just heard about a certain baby and about certain exceptions becoming the rule
0	you don ’ t believe that we got rid of it , do you ?
0	mrs khokhlakov had long felt sorry for him and now she offered him an extremely sensible piece of advice—namely , to quit his debauchery , leave his ugly passion , stop wasting his youthful energy in taverns , and , instead , to go gold-mining in siberia where , she said , he would find an application for his turbulent energies and his romantic character which so longed for adventure
0	in the first place , i found vasin 's room more and more irritating
0	here , sir , please , accept forty rubles
0	for i may take a knife with me when i go there , i haven ’ t decided yet
0	all i know is that mother is completely shattered
0	for a whole month he had been visualizing the scene of the crime and preparing himself for it , so as soon as he caught sight of something that could be used as a weapon , he picked it up
0	i never thought that an intelligent man like you would want to talk about that anymore
0	but as it happened , he dashed off to his father ’ s place , unexpectedly , spontaneously , and the chances are that he did not even remember about his drunken ’ letter at all
0	then you sat down on the sofa and took a sip of coffee out of a cup on the table
0	so that ’ s how they feel !
0	i could not understand her emotional outburst ; i would never suspected her capable of anything like that
0	young smurov suddenly cried out
0	it would be possible to bring back to life a heart that had long been dead and frozen
0	there was great strength in his look
0	he got up , clasped his hands again , and the next thing i knew he was kneeling before me
0	this was the cradle of europe and that thought filled me with love and kindred feelings
0	she had picked him because he was single and also because she had been dissatisfied with his behavior , and he was aware of this
0	he was holding a big book , so big , indeed , that it seemed to me that he had difficulty carrying it
0	you will find out later
0	then you started saying something in french to mrs prutkov that at once brought a frown to her brow
0	mitya , incidentally , visited their house rather seldom
0	three thousand , is not it ?
0	for quite some time i have been feeling guilty toward you
0	so what else could i do with myself ?
0	now , take the classical languages—it ’ s sheer madness
0	well , honest widow , he said to her , i want to be a real benefactor to your son , and do everything that can be done for him
0	and it is possible that no one except smerdyakov knew where fyodor karamazov had hidden it
0	soon , however , he resigned , moved to petersburg , and became a counsel for parties involved in private lawsuits
0	i wasn ’ t talking about faith in general , but about that particular trait , about those two hermits , about just that small detail which is so completely russian—it ’ s typically russian , isn ’ t it ?
0	for two days he said no more about it , but then he asked , how 's the boy ?
0	the case now appeared in quite a new light
0	miusov settled in paris for good and lost sight of mitya , his interest in the boy petering out completely after the february revolution , which made such an ineradicable impression on him
0	and it happened today , did not it ?
0	here is the letter he wrote me that night
0	mitya again grabbed the coachman by the shoulders
0	i wrote you a stupid letter and you consented to what i asked and came here
0	i ’ ve seen money in my time
0	the elder raised his hand and was about to make the sign of the cross toward ivan , when ivan suddenly got up , walked over to him , received his blessing , kissed his hand , and went back to his seat—all without uttering a sound
0	they all gaped at him in silence , sensing that something disgraceful was about to happen , something absurd that would end in a disgusting public exhibition
0	he , for his part , did not pursue the matter any further
0	what did you say ?
0	very shortly after losing her husband , the inconsolable widow took all her daughters ( they had no sons ) on a long trip to italy , sending alyosha to live with two ladies who were distant relatives of mr polenov ’ s
0	a note of total sincerity vibrated in her voice
0	and what do you think—he demanded that i give him a promissory note for the remaining twenty-three hundred payable to a certain merchant , feeling that it would be safer that way
0	i ’ m nothing but a bug and i most humbly admit that it ’ s quite beyond me why things are arranged the way they are
0	this is a temptation , but i will ignore it , i finally made up my mind
0	but , as i have said before , all these views will be combined and arranged in the prosecutor ’ s summation , to which we shall now come
0	but i wonder if i may ask you something without making you angry : is it true that you are getting married ?
0	don ’ t you know , the saint said to the woman , how bold these little ones are before the throne of the lord ?
0	you know—well , don ’ t laugh now—about a year or so ago i composed a sort of poem and , if you ’ re willing to waste , say , another ten minutes with me , i could recite it to you
0	so you must learn to love for nothing , like alyosha
0	but i will come to that later , although no , perhaps i wo not , i do not think it 's of much interest
0	if there was anything in the world i least expected at that moment , it was to see her appear and i leaped up in alarm
0	it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god , he read and flung the book violently away
0	a sarcastic smile played on his lips
0	i told you everything before , everything , but not that , because even i wasn ’ t brazen enough to talk about it
0	he stopped , turned his head toward me , and waited
0	the temperature was eleven degrees below zero ( centigrade ) and the ground was crusted with ice
0	he sat in his chair and watched his neighbor miusov with a sarcastic little smile , obviously delighting in his frustration
0	i was so obsessed with him that i almost forgot my main goal
0	i was preparing for my university entrance examination then
0	fine , fine , they may object to this , but still , when he got there , he killed his father and took the money
0	if she was trying to find out what her daughter was up to , it would be her right and there ’ d be nothing low about it !
0	it would simply transfer the concept of the state from the wrong premises to the correct ones , to the only true way of achieving the eternal goals
0	they flayed him alive and he died a martyr ’ s death , praising and glorifying christ
0	at times , though , there was an absent , obstinate look about him : he could listen to you without taking his eyes off you , while thinking of something completely different
0	true , thanks to that attitude , he remained inscrutable to me since i could not possibly humiliate myself by begging him to take me seriously
0	what do you mean it 's your money ?
0	i remember how elated i was
0	and there was something vague about the otherwise determined look in his rather large , dark , somewhat bulging eyes
0	go in and see for yourself what ’ s going on in there
0	yes , for the moment , you will have to put up with it
0	what are you talking about ?
0	i was terribly surprised
0	but do you really imagine that versilov comes to see you to remind you of the money you owe him ?
0	it had just about everything that could be found in a large store in the capital , all sorts of delicacies , all the wines bottled by yeliseyev brothers & co ; it carried all kinds of fruit , cigars , and , of course , tea , coffee , sugar , and such things
0	it was only then that they learned that this saint had broken his vow of obedience to his elder and so , despite his great exploits , had to be pardoned by his elder before he could receive christian burial
0	mother , do you remember that when you came to visit me at touchard 's school i did not even want to recognize you ?
0	i think that , in most cases , a man becomes revolting to look at when he laughs
0	an exactly similar scene took place here when i was burying versilov after having torn him out of my heartbut after that there was a resurrection from the dead
0	he just stared wildly around him
0	but in that same second he caught sight of ilyusha ’ s little boots by the boy ’ s bed
0	i don ’ t think i ’ ll go there at all anymore
0	first there will be the likes of him , then there ’ ll be better ones
0	we ’ ll come back to that , magistrate nelyudov said quickly ; in the meantime , i would like the clerk to write down this point , namely , that you considered the money in that envelope as your rightful property
0	besides , he won ’ t marry her because she will never marry him , katerina added with a strange smile
0	since we sat talking together late into the night , i wo not attempt to repeat all that was said and will restrict myself to noting down the facts that shed light on a facet of versilov that until then had remained a mystery to me
0	this letter was written by the late stolbeyev himself , whose will gave rise to the lawsuit between versilov and the princes sokolsky
0	and even then , the older of the two brothers , ivan , did not express his suspicion of smerdyakov until today , when he was obviously feverish and in a state of nervous disorder , for during the past two months we know for fact that he shared the general conviction of his brother ’ s guilt and he never even tried to argue against it
0	but when he opened the door , she screamed :
0	good afternoon , von sohn , how are you ?
0	no one , no one at all
0	and now leave me , please
0	then all they had to do was shovel the earth on top of it , pack the earth down with a roller , and then pave it over , and everything was smooth and neat and the stone was gone !
0	i ’ ve just remembered something that had quite slipped my mind , he said , but then , at the time , i didn ’ t grasp its meaning and it is only now that
0	so the devils in hell started moaning and crying because they thought they wouldn ’ t get no more sinners after that
0	well , i will die before i ask versilov about lambert !
0	i suddenly heard next to me the voice of a distinguished-looking gentleman in a blue overcoat
0	i assumed he was ironically implying that kraft 's reasoning was faulty or even stupid
0	and what made you decide to take that money yesterday ?
0	this caused me to slip into a vulgarly familiar tone
0	perhaps , the thought flashed through his head , she ’ s overdoing her enthusiasm a bit
0	but i see that you feel more like dancing around just now than debating such matters
0	i want them to be reassured
0	i ’ m just an ordinary murderer !
0	as long as i ’ m strong enough to walk around , i ’ ll do so ; when i can no longer stand on my feet and have to stay in bed , let them give me any medical treatment they can think of , he decided , dismissing his illness with a shrug
0	so she took me to petersburg and entered me in the cadet corps school
0	lately i had been very rude at home , mostly to her
0	the fellow who will be in the restaurant , the pockmarked son of a bitch , he 's a real shrewd trickster , so you would better not talk to him or , if he starts asking you all sorts of questions , answer him any kind of rubbish you can think of
0	why , i ’ m not going to do anything , he said , suddenly addressing grushenka , who had pulled back toward kalganov and was tightly clutching his hand
0	but even now , at night , i go back to the servants ’ cottage , the agreement being that until midnight i ’ m not to go to bed , but must make the rounds of the yard every so often , watching out for miss grushenka , for whom he ’ s been waiting the last few days just as if he ’ d gone mad
0	when i used to pay for his drinks in the tavern , he had a quite different look , mitya thought , as he climbed into the cart
0	the prosecutor screwed up his nose slightly as if he had tasted something bitter ; he obviously did not quite approve of his colleague ’ s putting the question so openly
0	and if i sometimes talk nonsense , it is actually intentional , to make people laugh , to please them
0	when i left for petersburg , i decided to give mr versilov every satisfaction he might demand of me
0	ah , how did you put it ?
0	he didn ’ t seem to understand the question
0	i do not really know why she felt she had to kiss lisa , but i was sure it was the right thing to do
0	true , i am in a bit of a rush , but i am terribly glad to see you
0	ah , i forgot that i came here to punish myself , she added , her expression changing abruptly from what it had been when they were murmuring lovingly to each other
0	she must be terribly worried by now
0	no civilization without god ?
0	he came , he shouted , give me three thousand rubles
0	oh yes , of course , everything
0	it is true , though , that four years had passed since the old merchant had installed her in that cottage , after bringing her back with him from the capital of the province , and much had changed since then
0	so now i am just trying to maintain my reputation as a respectable man while trying to make a living somehow or other and being a congenial companion
0	the next second he felt very cold
0	he had provoked me to this parting scene
0	therefore , the old prince would have to make his move : perhaps run away , join anna , and marry her within twenty-four hours
0	is it true , then , what i heard about you going around preaching and wearing chains ?
0	then he snatched at them with his other hand , crumpled them , and squeezed them tightly in his fist
0	i do not know how such behavior is supposed to be judged nowadays , what thoughts you have on the subject , or how you believe it should affect your mother , your brother , your father
0	those pale young ladies are worth nothing , not a thing ; you should have seen how i handled them when i was twenty-eight
0	whose child is he ?
0	in a few days i ’ ll be leaving the monastery for good , and once i ’ m out in the world , i know i must get married : he said so
0	in the beginning i could not understand what he had on his mind or why he came , but later i thought that , from a certain point of view , it was not so stupid on his part
0	i shouted , beside myself
0	don ’ t make up with him , papa , don ’ t
0	i am leaving now and in an hour or so i may be back here with ka-terina
0	in fact , i am sure i am not worthy of her or lisa
0	it 's all so frightening !
0	but his daughter—if anyone has a strong character , it is anna !
0	and so he sat now , realizing full well that he was delirious , with his eyes focused , as i ’ ve already mentioned , on that point on the sofa opposite him
0	now let me tell you the trick that young gentleman played last week
0	he had returned to our town to stay only about three years before alyosha came
0	maximov suggested with a chuckle
0	but , all right , i will let it go one more time
0	he seemed sincerely delighted to see me :
0	well , if that ’ s what you want , i have no objections
0	i know that neither of you will ever leave me
0	i am very fond of sergei !
0	first you must let me finish
0	i ’ ve heard a lot about you , too
0	i got up , went back to my room , and lay down too
0	perhaps once you ’ ve had a glass of this stuff , you ’ ll start the dance , though
0	then , with a most dignified air , he went back to puffing at his pipe
0	for many years now , people in russia have been wringing their hands beseechingly and begging us to stop this madly galloping troika
0	i offended him , he kept repeating sadly
0	she ’ s really the queen of all the world ’ s imaginable she-devils !
0	his name is gorstkin , but that ’ s not what they call him : he ’ s known as the hound ’ in the district
0	if only i would had an inkling of what was on her mind at that moment !
0	when he was going to be confirmed , a priest called abbe rigaud came to congratulate him
0	i will go and get the landlord , anna said , getting up
0	i cried and sobbed
0	in the next few days , after studying the depositions of the witnesses and the available evidence , ivan became entirely convinced of dmitry ’ s guilt
0	the blood had dried , but not to the point of becoming hard and crumbling
0	useless and unrelated thoughts kept drifting into alyosha ’ s head , as often happens during a time of idle waiting
0	nowadays everybody hangs himself !
0	he pointed at the permanently locked side door between my room and my landlord 's quarters , now occupied by the old prince
0	once , however , he said more
0	last week he even made a scene about kuzma
0	absorbed as i was in all these thoughts , i did not notice that i would finally reached home , that is , mother 's house
0	moreover , the notorious manuscript turned out to be nothing but a translation of some french material that he had been collecting for his private edification , to be used only as reference for a learned article he was planning to write eventually for a magazine
0	strictly speaking , of course , this is true now
0	i no longer saw why i should be so upset by whatever lambert may have told him
0	but i had no control—it sort of happened on its own
0	i remember sitting by the schoolroom window , looking out at the dusty street and the few passers-by
0	the boys of the third class at once made up the following epigram :
0	versilov mumbled , throwing a cursory glance in my direction
0	no , i never believed it , grushenka said firmly ; i knew he was an honorable man
0	that is so , but what came of it ?
0	he did not seem particularly interested
0	i wo not do anything against you ; you need not worry
0	do you understand what i mean by that ?
0	imagine a baby in the arms of his trembling mother , with turks all around them
0	he listened to the story , sipping his brandy , and remarked that the soldier in question ought to be immediately promoted to sainthood and the skin that had been peeled off him sent to some monastery : you can just imagine all the people who ’ d go running , and all the money they ’ d make
0	so it has been destroyed !
0	listen , i usually have tea at this hour ; i must go and order it , and you will have some with me , wo not you ?
0	much could happen before then
0	but this time it was lisa
0	moreover , it so happened that the child ’ s relations on his mother ’ s side had also , at first , forgotten his existence
0	how do you know what she told me ?
0	he could hardly catch his breath
0	moreover , it is no longer so rare to find fathers and heads of our culture-bearing families mocking and ridiculing values that their children may still have been happy to believe in
0	usually we— that is , my mother , my sister , and i—would get up around eight , while versilov lingered in bed until half past nine or so
0	i was flying through the air as if something were pushing me
0	the women roared with laughter
0	mitya , do you hear bells jingling ?
0	he was unable to love passively : as soon as he came to love someone , he had to help that person
0	and you ’ re supposed to have seen god !
0	and besides , the whole town is in an uproar about his wild revelries !
0	i am purposely describing here scenes from my early daydreams to convey my idea as clearly as i can
0	when the champagne was served , he held out his glass to me :
0	i don ’ t see how katerina , with her intelligence and her almost morbid sensitivity , could have failed to foresee that people would say just such things
0	but this is sheer delirium , gentlemen , the police inspector exclaimed
0	he first stared blankly at me , then frowned with exasperation
0	but then , i suppose you have a gold mine or something
0	but the worst thing about his type is that they can ’ t understand a joke
0	so these were the thoughts that were choking me too like a noose
0	now you ’ re talking nonsense
0	in the end , however , he started brooding ; he gradually became aware of the burden weighing on his conscience and then realized he was not strong enough to bear that burden
0	but contact with real life will cure you , it never fails to , with natures such as yours
0	what will i do then ?
0	he said quietly and resignedly , listening in surprise to his own voice , and then , completely unexpectedly , he sat down on the bench
0	a man who has done many vile , despicable things , but an honorable man nevertheless
0	yes , there is a little of that
0	have you quarreled or something ?
0	did you see it ?
0	oh , it was not just the war that was going on , nor what had happened at the tuileries— i would always known that all that was fated to go , that the whole old european world would vanish sooner or later
0	besides , it was she who sent him away , although he may have been a bit hasty in accepting his dismissal
0	the night at zershikov 's , where we saw each other for the last time
0	to that , i would answer once more that my young man had faith , a sacred and unshakable faith , and that i still refuse to apologize for him
0	perhaps i would already promised him the last time he came
0	maria , too , got up
0	i was prevented by my guardian angel and that ’ s something you ’ ve forgotten to take into consideration
0	ah , the hell with
0	could it be , by any chance , that it is your blood in me that makes me so proud ?
0	although his words were slurred and rather hard to understand , his tone was firm and he obviously did not wish to add anything more
0	it was obvious from her expression that she had come on business , that she had something to tell him
0	but she does want to get married and she ’ s been thinking and thinking and thinking about a husband , and so she got him in the end
0	of course , i followed him to the door
0	so see you soon , lisa darling , sweet little lisa !
0	you ca not see him , there 's only his song mingling with the hymns , almost blending into them , although it 's completely different from them—i must manage to convey that somehow
0	in general , dmitry felt that , whatever happened later , whichever way things turned out , he had to face the imminent clash with his father first
0	are you coming to dinner tonight ?
0	and this was exactly what perkhotin decided to do
0	but i restrained myself and took the handkerchief
0	he served some liqueur too—the liqueur those rich ladies send him
0	during the days of my dreamy moscow loneliness the seed of the idea appeared in my mind while i was still in the second year of high school and has never left me since
0	and even now when it 's all in the past , i still find it infinitely hard to describe my idea
0	that must be the sabaneyev who used to work for the kuzmichevs , i guess , one of the women suggested
0	why did she send for a doctor too ?
0	she wants me to go to him , i was thinking , struggling into my coat while running downstairs , but where was i supposed to look for him ?
0	as i was to find out later , she would just learned something which had upset her terribly and from which she would not yet recovered
0	in the end , however , they left him in peace and stopped calling him little girl , at most feeling a little sorry for him for being so peculiar in that respect
0	all right , to pay back a debt
0	she was pleased to have someone else there and , for my part , i could tell her a few things that shed some light on what had happened
0	i no longer knew through which door we would entered and , without giving it much thought , i opened one of them and found myself in a long , narrow room with a settee in it and someone sitting on the settee
0	there was nothing more he could do
0	i got up , walked over to her , and handed her the money
0	i ’ m sorry , i feel too weak
0	i understand it all too well
0	she 's as lovely as an english engraving
0	you ’ ve got quite an eye , you know
0	with grushenka , he felt easier than with alyosha , although he spoke very little to her
0	you know , i have the impression that i am splitting into two
0	do you believe that i love you with my whole soul , alyosha ?
0	no , you must forgive me , perhaps i did not put it right , she hastened to correct herself
0	but soon someone knocked on the door and when i opened it , to my great surprise , i saw trishatov
0	i remember that it was at that juncture that the letter was read aloud in court by the clerk ; the public was horribly shocked
0	i lied and they all started repeating my lies
0	i can see that just by the way you were frightened
0	i believe he was rather pleased about that too
0	how can i leave him ?
0	it 's possible to win , but until now i have gambled like a fool , leaving everything to chance
0	why are you keeping him ?
0	what is there to explain ?
0	qu'est-ce que c'est que qa qu'une dame russe sur les eaux minerales et ou est donc la jolie montre que lambert vous a donnee ?
0	you would better dare , colonel !
0	his voice faltered and he hardly managed to articulate the last words
0	yes , that ’ s what i ’ ll do
0	it still bore three seals
0	so i , with my bad foot , dragged myself to her room and when i got there , she threw herself on me , started kissing me , and wept , and , still kissing me , pushed me out of her room without a word of explanation , so that i never found out anything
0	alyosha told him heatedly
0	just as expected , alyosha found his father sitting at table
0	i exclaimed , completely stunned again
0	mother , what are you trying to do , to kill me ?
0	but when he 's alone in the wild , it 's different , for there he can harden himself and be ready for any sacrifice
0	but do not you think he worded that letter in an awfully funny way ?
0	i can see very plainly that you are planning to doublecross me all the way
0	instead , he would left the house before daybreak , vanished into thin air , and that woman daria even said that he probably would not be back at all
0	and i ’ ll prove to them that i have nothing in common with that aesop , that clown , that ridiculous pierrot , that i was in his company by sheer bad luck , just as everyone else was
0	as perezvon was performing his last trick , the door opened and agafia , a fat , pockmarked woman of forty , appeared
0	he said , inviting mitya with a gracious gesture
0	because of uncontrollable curiosity
0	just look at yourself !
0	but they happen to be my worst and , above all , my most stupid and vulgar thoughts
0	i think i understand everything now , alyosha said quietly and sadly , without getting up
0	this gesture of mine was , of course , immediately interpreted as my intention to strike her
0	and now he 's completely ecstatic , they say , and only wondering why such a brilliant idea did not occur to him first
0	i had decided to go back to vasin 's
0	as soon as he had the deed in his hand , he would at once have mobilized a whole army of polish and jewish lawyers and they ’ d have managed to get him not just three thousand—they ’ d have stripped my father of the whole estate !
0	i was gaping at him in bewilderment and suddenly discerned something that might have been a glimmer of pity in his loathsome look
0	on these occasions i ’ m always against women , against their tears and hysterical outbursts
0	for a good twenty-five years now , he had been marrying off distant young relatives of his or his wife 's , cousins , stepdaughters , or perhaps goddaughters
0	we were talking about my convictions and not about my age , remember ?
0	the doctor was very offended , which in itself shows the kind of person he was , but continued his visits
0	conceit there may be , that comes from youth and it will pass if you really think it should pass
0	later , when trouble began in the house , when grushenka appeared on the scene and the tension between his father and his brother dmitry increased , ivan and smerdyakov discussed these matters too
0	i wouldn ’ t have done it without him coming
0	is that really necessary ?
0	i just stared at her , not knowing what to do next
0	well , all right , come here , and give a kiss to an old idiot !
0	he stood over me briefly , inquiring whether i had eaten , but i just waved him away
0	what did you think of that ?
0	in brief , there was a good chance of getting another six or perhaps even seven thousand out of the old man , for chermashnya was worth at least twenty-five , i mean , twenty-eight thousand
0	was it to give him in advance the clues as to who committed the crime ?
0	he kept exclaiming , looking at ilyusha , for he used to call him old man as a term of affection , when the boy was still alive
0	and that 's just terrible , terrible !
0	he did not say 'korovkin ' ; he said wouldolgorovki , meaning dolgoruky , he explained to me
0	this prayer will be heard and it will please the lord
0	but fetyukovich made short shrift of their reputations too
0	it was to avoid such misgiving that i instinctively began to seek self-sufficiency
0	i admit that , if i were in your place , i would not go around celebrating the fact that i was illegitimate
0	but i must admit , mr ivan , that i thought you ’ d guessed everything , smerdyakov said in a completely innocent tone
0	there is a drive in me that can withstand anything , ivan said coldly , with a twisted grin
0	all right , never mind then
0	oh no , you and he , you can go right ahead , and i ’ ll step out of your way so as not to disturb you !
0	the way ilyusha wanted it
0	and she vanished like a ghost
0	i think i ’ ve offended alyosha
0	he had turned frightfully pale
0	ah , yes , it ’ s that wedding , that marriage , of course
0	at this point i gave up all this senseless tangle and my head sank hopelessly onto the pillow
0	ah , how little you understand me , my dear !
0	that ’ s the third time i ’ ve told you
0	kolya ’ s hand dove into the satchel once again and emerged with a little vial that contained real powder
0	i am in love with youth !
0	i was wondering why you hadn ’ t asked me to do so from the beginning
0	mitya was rather pleased with this arrangement—if she sits there with samsonov , at least she won ’ t be rushing off to father ’ s
0	the eyes of all the spectators were fastened on him
0	but it turned out that averyanov 's signature had been forged
0	but you understand that it ’ s just the same as if it were yours , for he ’ ll always let you play with it
0	we ’ ll check it all , go over it all again with the other witnesses—in your presence of course , examining magistrate nelyudov said , concluding the session
0	but before you go in , karamazov , may i ask just one thing , if it ’ s all right with you ?
0	they were both there , mitya
0	nevertheless , that german hit it just right
0	lise cried , looking at alyosha in amazement
0	what was that officer threatening ?
0	more than once , sometimes during the day and sometimes at night , i would heard strange sounds coming from it , but since they would never lasted for more than a few seconds and had been followed by total silence , i would never paid much attention to them
0	but is it true that he kissed that portrait ?
0	run along , tell him i am coming
0	when i saw that , i left
0	i learned lots of them by heart and recited a fable to andronikov each time i entered his tiny study , whether he was busy or not
0	i wish i knew how to make you like me always , he muttered , blushing too
0	ivan karamazov had been graduated from the university , had collected his two thousand rubles , and was planning to take a trip abroad , when one of the major newspapers carried a very strange article of his that caught the interest even of non-specialists
0	he tapped the signal , father opened the door for him , and
0	after that you can decide for yourself what to do next
0	at this point i would like to say for myself personally that it makes me quite sick when i think of all the commotion caused by that phenomenon , which , though it was unpleasant and unsavory , was at the same time unimportant and quite natural
0	they have a private posting station , mr karamazov
0	ah , the way you looked when you first came in !
0	everyone was shouting that he was the murderer and i felt that , if he had killed his father , he must have done it because of me
0	right now i still know too little about the stock exchange , shares , the banking business , and the whole world of high finance
0	after that , he continued to sit in the same spot , hardly stirring
0	we would been looking for each other and fate had brought us together , giving both of us a similar strange feeling
0	but i can ’ t help it , things just get said by themselves whether i want them to or not
0	he himself had finished eating and was drinking tea
0	thus , the conciliation of claims between church and state on such matters as the administration of justice is , in my opinion , quite impossible by its very nature
0	oh , i would be able to hide my money in my corner so that they would not steal it from me or even suspect i had any at all—that i can guarantee !
0	well , that touchard follow walked in with a letter in his hand , went up to the big oak table at which all six of us were sitting doing our homework , grabbed me by the shoulder , lifted me from my seat , and told me to pick up all my books and follow him
0	oh , be gone , vile memory !
0	she was wearing her fur coat and was accompanied by—or rather was walking arm in arm with—a tall , straight-backed , forbidding-looking officer in full uniform , including sword , while a lackey followed behind , carrying the officer 's greatcoat
0	i ’ ll tell you , sir
0	i would like to introduce you , arkady , anna said in a very loud voice
0	how can it be such a joy to you , my darling , when you are so feverish at night and cough so that it sounds as if your chest is about to burst
0	that ’ s what he called very quickly
0	ah , my lovely ones , don ’ t blame your own mother !
0	and so he pulled his hand back from the bell and rushed off to smerdyakov ’ s
0	for instance , at this moment , could
0	there was no one else in there with her and she was obviously waiting
0	love is such an infinite treasure it can buy the whole world and can redeem not only your sins , but the sins of all people
0	but i still appreciate your welcome and i will remember it
0	did you say difficult ?
0	but it makes no sense !
0	he already knew the sick girl—she came from a village only five miles from the monastery and had been brought to him on several previous occasions
0	you know very well , alyosha said in a low and penetrating voice
0	i have only come to warn you
0	she received me politely but was very matter-of-fact and not in the least chatty , which reconciled me somewhat to the place
0	it would be charming , he said , looking at me penetratingly , provided , of course , your stories are really amusing
0	you ’ re wrong , monk , it was for just that kind of love !
0	five minutes , they go on to ten , harder , faster , more stingingly
0	right , ilyusha , there ’ s nothing in this world more powerful than the rich
0	such suggestions only made smerdyakov turn pale with indignation , although he never answered anything
0	when pressed both by the prosecutor and the defense counsel , the doctor confirmed that ivan karamazov had come to consult him two days previously , that he had warned him that the threat of a brain fever attack was imminent , but that the patient had refused to be treated
0	the presiding judge then read off the questions that the jurors were to answer and asked both sides to make their final statements
0	and grabbing alyosha by the arm , the captain led him out of the room and into the street
0	may i say that i know my brother , dmitry karamazov , is now very sorry for what he did and that , if you would allow him to come and see you or , if you prefer , to meet you in the same public place and apologize to you before everybody , he would do so
0	it was simply that we felt like going
0	but before ivan had taken three steps , he called out : mr ivan !
0	you know , my dear boy , i have never been able to imagine men turning into ungrateful and stupid animals
0	he was a freckled redhead and was not too big
0	one especially , at the end of the row , caught his attention
0	oh , you should have seen how frightened he was when he came here !
0	the furniture was white , very old , upholstered in a red silky material , which was worn and faded
0	i was sitting here , before you came , and do you know what i was thinking about ?
0	real laughter must be free of malice , while it is malice that makes people laugh mostly
0	what sort of a man is your landlord ?
0	so how can anyone tell a man that there 's no point in him doing anything ?
0	ivan had always respected alyosha ’ s opinion and that was why he was so bewildered by it now
0	without hesitation , i opted for the idea , for i thought i had mathematical proof that it would work
0	sure , and now i have not got one kopek leftl i see you ca not do it either
0	he ’ s visited me twice , maybe even three times
0	was it simply to enable him to boast to satan later and say to him something like , see how my saint can suffer for my sake !
0	i ’ m a fool and i ’ m really not worth bothering about
0	and so he 's lived—it 's almost ten years now—a life of great austerity , practicing the renunciation of all earthly desires , but he still refuses to take monastic vows
0	and what about you , von sohn , there ’ s no point your staying around
0	the boy stood still , waiting
0	stingy though i am , i ’ ll open that bottle
0	but one day a first cousin of adelaida ’ s returned from paris
0	besides , to get home you have to turn right here
0	i suddenly cried out loud , feeling the blood rush to my face
0	he doesn ’ t really care
0	it doesn ’ t become you very well , ivan said , laughing
0	the gift of making people love him was inherent in him ; he gained people ’ s affection directly and effortlessly ; it was part of his nature
0	i never trust people who like that sort of musty tidiness and especially the servile deference of their landladies
0	and he , dmitry , he may never have loved you either
0	oh , it 's not that i was betraying her , but i had to be on his side
0	however , if you have spoken to me so frankly only to make me praise you for your sincerity , then , of course , you will fail to accomplish true acts of love ; all your good intentions will remain mere daydreams , and your whole life will slip by like a shadow
0	his face looked changed—it was radiant with joy
0	but that does not seem to embarrass the shameless creature
0	but now , as i write , my cheeks are red from shame
0	can you possibly mean what you say ?
0	he remembered it long afterward
0	and all that time i was insolently sprawling on sergei 's sofa , playing at being his equal , trying to be familiar with his lousy friends !
0	but i want to tell you for the last time : i am not guilty of my father ’ s murder !
0	they had been until then in the house frequented by the gilded youth that i would stopped patronizing
0	as god is my witness , i acquired it involuntarily
0	indeed , even when he was still very young , he reached a point where nothing either shocked or horrified him
0	it ’ s true , though , that father wanted to tell me something else yesterday , but somehow couldn ’ t in his excitement
0	so i emigrated , he went on , without regretting anything that i would left behind
0	it 's some sort of nervousness or over-sensitivity that he must have contracted living in the monastery
0	he was getting a bad headache
0	well , since it will be lodged in my brain , i ’ m rather curious to see what it ’ s really like
0	what are you doing with alphonsine ?
0	also , while still in moscow , i decided that i would not be a pawnbroker or usurer
0	they had finished eating when alyosha arrived
0	there were times when i would look at him and wonder how a man like that could possibly ever have sat on government committees or presided at shareholders ' meetings
0	no , it wasn ’ t me !
0	the fellow said angrily ; i know you all right !
0	we had a fight and then made it up
0	rakitin ’ s position at the monastery was too lowly for him to be invited to the father superior ’ s table
0	and i ’ ll know but will say nothing
0	no , it was my rage that tormented me
0	so let us be on our way , mr karamazov
0	she cried with a renewed burst of indignation
0	i could not have expected less from a man of your kindness , dmitry said , interrupting him in his turn
0	it ’ s a real heartbreak , a fantastic farce : she ’ s in love with your brother ivan but is trying very hard to convince herself that she ’ s really in love with your brother dmitry
0	and you simply stumbled upon him at just such a moment
0	i have been so astounded by it all this time that i have kept asking myself : could she really be that woman ?
0	and if that is so , if russia and her justice are really what i know they are , may russia forge ahead , ahead , and let no one try to frighten us with stories about madly galloping troikas , from which foreign nations pull back in disgust !
0	i noticed that , for all his urbane polish and the twenty-year distance that separated us from the events , he was extremely reticent and evasive
0	his plan was to lure both mrs prutkov and me out of the apartment before katerina was due to arrive , if only for a quarter of an hour
0	so i sprawled on the sofa again and opened a book that happened to be lying around
0	i intend , however , to fight you—i warn you of that—and i shall fight you to the bitter end ; after that it will be up to god
0	and when nelyudov asked whether he himself had knocked on his father ’ s window , mitya said he had used the signal signifying that grushenka had arrived , and banged it out on the table again
0	well , i will skip the details , but the result was a very complicated and disgusting scandal
0	within a second , miusov ’ s mood switched from the utmost benignity to fury
0	no , it was not quite that
0	he sat up straight in his chair and stared in the direction of the poles
0	whose fault is it that this man , with his naturally good inclinations and his responsive and sensitive heart , was brought up in such a preposterous way ?
0	then the maid nas-tasia knocked on the door and said there was a lady outside inquiring about olga
0	he rushed off somewhere before seven ; he seemed very busy
0	perhaps there ’ s something or other ?
0	but she already loved another man , a distinguished , high-ranking army officer ; he was away at the time on active service , but she expected him back soon
0	well , who can tell , perhaps he ’ d really take me on
0	you really amaze me !
0	( his stepfather stebelkov , on the other hand , is still in prison for his involvement in an affair that is getting more and more complicated as time goes by )
0	my forehead was burning
0	alyosha , who was almost out of his mind with anxiety for him and for the rest of them , managed nevertheless to support him by the arm
0	and now see how he repays me for having saved him !
0	then he gave perkhotin a long , dreamy look , smiling at him
0	there 's no one you need apologize to , kraft said very slowly in a low dreamy voice
0	ah , i wish i could do it !
0	it ’ s just a mile or so from here and , instead of their lenten diet , you ’ ll get a suckling pig for dinner and i ’ ll bring out some brandy for you and then some liqueur too—i have , for instance , a certain raspberry liqueur
0	so , you see , that may be the reason i ’ m dressed up now , my poor rakitin , grushenka concluded with a wicked chuckle
0	i want a mathematically precise answer
0	but once he had started , his thoughts soon shifted to something else
0	and i ’ ve been playing around with your brother mitya to stop myself from running to that other man
0	that was why , after my escape from alphonsine 's custody , he did not have much difficulty in finding me ( he simply asked for versi-lov 's address at the registry office )
0	i ’ m ready to leave any time ; i don ’ t suppose there ’ s anything else you want with me
0	they christened him paul and registered his patronymic as fyodorovich as a matter of course , without asking anyone ’ s permission
0	i ’ ll bring it all up in court tomorrow
0	oh , i understand that you have the official authority to question me , but not about any intimate thoughts i may have had
0	only a man who is completely innocent and is not afraid of being accused of complicity could act this way
0	you seem pleased despite your sorrow
0	why have you come to interfere with our work ?
0	he could not bear to stand in the corner for more than a minute
0	but look at that !
0	i let slip some wonderful opportunities but tried to control myself and remain calm and self-confident
0	once he even said to governor schultz : credo , but i ’ m not sure in what
0	do not judge me because i have already condemned myself
0	and perhaps you know , too , that for a couple of months now i ’ ve been receiving a very nice , well-mannered , serious young man who works here as a civil servant—peter perkhotin
0	he just winked slyly
0	mother nature ’ s milk of joy ,
0	i will report you to your school principal and you ’ d better see to it that , instead of going about testing your theories , you sit over your books and do your schoolwork !
0	these heart-warming thoughts poured out of me irresistibly
0	ah , but what do you expect me to tell you ?
0	the counsel screams in his clients ’ defense : this concerns no one but the family !
0	you must prove to the world at large that there are men ready to uphold it , and that it is in good hands !
0	i ’ ve got mixed up
0	first , this was a way to get even with alyosha—that is , to witness the fall of the upright , alyosha ’ s transformation from a saint to a sinner—and he was savoring that in advance
0	that ’ s not true , kalganov said
0	at this moment , for instance , there ’ s a lady waiting for him there with her sick daughter
0	she must be flogged in public
0	there seemed nothing i could get out of him
0	i do not even know who you are talking about
0	this fact was treasured with sacred fervor by the monks as a beautiful and miraculous pledge of an even greater sanctity for the monastery ’ s tombs in the future , if , by the grace of god , that time should come
0	instinctively , i grabbed the doorknob and would not let her close the door
0	the little pole turned red in the face , got up , and rushed out of the room with the air of a man who can no longer bear such indignity
0	there was only one hope left : he might have gone to my lodgings , but i no longer thought that very likely
0	i turned away and joined those who were endeavoring to correct your work
0	did ivan insist very much ?
0	i can ’ t believe my eyes !
0	but you could have taken the initiative and spoken to me first if i was such a fool
0	and it was true
0	i can still see his little face at that moment—i ’ ll never forget it as long as i live , you know
0	the letter was written hurriedly and the excitement of the writer was evident in every line
0	she was walking very fast , but when she saw alyosha she turned toward him and said :
0	also , let me tell you that all this time i have been wanting to see you and talk to you secretly ; only i did not know how to arrange it
0	but all of a sudden she let out a piercing cry and reeled back
0	well , i suppose i ’ m doomed to sit with you for god knows how long
0	alyosha suddenly leapt up from his seat , just as his mother had , threw up his hands , covered his face with them , then collapsed back into his chair as though his legs had been pulled out from under him , and suddenly started shaking in a succession of hysterical , violent , soundless sobs
0	but later i also found out that it could become immensely proud and that it could crush people with one glance , such as the one you gave me at your father 's the day you arrived from moscow
0	on one side was a wattle fence with vegetable patches behind it and on the other was the tall , strong fence around his father ’ s garden
0	he looked like a man about to perform a solemn ritual
0	his eye was quick , his behavior reserved , and he seemed to be constantly on guard
0	there she is—can ’ t you see ?
0	she cried in a heart-rending wail , wringing her hands , as tears filled her eyes
0	he stopped abruptly and remained silent for a moment
0	but who is that sabaneyev he was talking about ?
0	wait at least until i ’ ve left the room
0	i ’ m not mavriky to you , remember !
0	forgive me , good people !
0	there is nothing more alluring to man than freedom of conscience , but neither is there anything more agonizing
0	but ivan said in an exhausted voice :
0	but then i thought you might assault me for having put on only the lion and the sun and not the north star and sirius as well
0	he could read to them how the brothers later went to buy grain in egypt , where , by that time , joseph had become a powerful man at the court ; and , unrecognized by them , he tormented and accused them , and kept his youngest brother benjamin as a hostage , although all the time he loved them—i love you and , loving you , i torment you—but had never forgotten how one day , somewhere in the parched plain , by a well , they had sold him to some passing merchants and he had wept , wringing his hands and begging his brothers not to make him a slave in a foreign land
0	about five minutes after the bleeding versilov had fallen to the carpet , lambert , who had been lying in a puddle of his own blood and whom we would all assumed dead , suddenly stirred , sat up , and scrambled to his feet
0	she meekly helped mother in the house and looked after the convalescing versilov , but she practically refused to talk and even avoided looking at anyone
0	it was already pretty boring before , but they felt they had to make it even more boring ; it was already senseless , so they had to make it still more senseless
0	i ’ d have been quite incapable of conveying it all to them in a letter
0	at twenty -eight , dmitry karamazov looked much older than he was
0	in the first place , they violate rules of social conduct and , in the second place , they raise dust on the boulevard where everybody is entitled to walk—me , ivan , fyodor , everybody
0	foma was a private in my battalion
0	it would be good for you to get to know people like her and to learn to appreciate them ; yes , and there are so many other things that one can learn from such people , alyosha said with deep conviction
0	he was gasping for breath
0	from the living room , a passage led to the kitchen where old lukeria lived and cooked , and one could tell when she was cooking because the whole place reeked of burned fat
0	it ’ s for your benefit that he ’ s putting all this on , he whispered
0	in any case , i am very grateful to you , he said again
0	so up on your feet then !
0	never again to associate the name of my daughter with this sordid story
0	as a matter of fact , he held himself so straight that his back did not seem to need any support whatsoever , although he was obviously ill he wore over his shirt a short fur-lined jacket ; his knees were wrapped in mother 's plaid blanket and he had slippers on his feet
0	when they heard that , all three of them—he and the two seconds—began to shout at me
0	mitya , who was still holding the crumpled bills in his hand—bills that had attracted everyone ’ s attention , particularly the two polish gentlemen ’ s—looked at her in sheepish embarrassment and quickly thrust the money into his pocket
0	he even seemed to enjoy—indeed , to feel flattered by—his ridiculous role as a cuckolded husband , for he insisted on describing his own disgrace in minute detail , even embellishing on it
0	were you supposed to be somewhere ?
0	anna versilov had been , since her early childhood , the old prince 's favorite ( for the prince and versilov had known each other an awfully long time )
0	he asked smerdyakov , who had followed ivan into the house
0	i went out into the garden
0	i realized that lisa was trying hard to control herself , but the second our eyes chanced to meet she could not hold it back any longer and burst into a fit of laughter
0	and , anyway , if i have not been very straightforward with you , neither have you been with me , she added with a quick smile
0	oh , it ’ s about your brother dmitry and all that business that happened recently—you know , lise ’ s mother explained casually
0	to answer an important question for me
0	why did i want to see you so badly ?
0	his request was courteously granted
0	be specific : where did it happen ?
0	indeed , i believe it would be in poor taste
0	in any case , the young man did not despair and quickly found work—first tutoring at a few kopeks an hour , then making the rounds of the editorial offices of newspapers , peddling ten-line news items on street incidents or the like that he signed eyewitness
0	people said later that , in his portrayal of ivan , the prosecutor was motivated , to some extent , by personal resentment , which was quite improper in the present circumstances
0	that herzenstube always comes and starts by saying that he can ’ t understand
0	indeed , the letter proves that the accused had a program , and this stamps his crime as premeditated murder !
0	by the way , alyosha , you haven ’ t seen dmitry today , have you ?
0	and after that enigmatic outcry , without waiting for my answer , she ran out of the room to join them
0	besides , in that establishment , i would often been lucky
0	i do not know whether that warden was a decent man or not , nor do i think the question is relevant here , but i do know that he very courteously put a private room at sergei 's and my disposal after readily authorizing my visit
0	we shall be lying , because we do not intend to allow you to come back
0	i ’ ll send the carriage to pick you up later
0	no , you really mustn ’ t go to her place
0	in the course of the performance , the virgin comes out on stage and announces her bon jugement in person
0	but why should kraft 's discovery of russia 's secondary role weaken men 's aspirations for a universal human cause ?
0	for three months , that is , before the question of my going to petersburg even came up , there had been something that would grab my heart and force it to pound wildly in my chest
0	how right you are , barbara , my daughter , you can ’ t expect anything sensible from such people , i told her , and for that time i got out of it that way
0	so you have definitely made up your mind to leave tomorrow morning ?
0	your trouble is that you are not used to staying long in one place
0	sounds like smerdyakov , alyosha thought , and she must be the landlady ’ s daughter , the one who came back from moscow and who has a dress with a train and goes to father ’ s house to get a bowl of soup from martha
0	perhaps it was because of his obvious disregard for the generally accepted standards of behavior , for it did not occur to me then that it could be due simply to his imbecility
0	the effort made the tall fellow 's face look incredibly determined
0	i ’ m seeing all this in a dream
0	that is what happened now , as soon as the elder covered the hysterical girl with his stole
0	that ’ s where they get it now
0	wretched all my life i ’ ll feel
0	and i went on to tell him about the bear which once came to the hut of a great saint who was seeking salvation in the forest
0	this is not what the truly jealous man is like
0	but there 's nothing to bind me to you any longer , nothing at all !
0	i walked home on foot
0	it ’ s this way , please
0	we must be tried together !
0	i am not frowning , it 's just that
0	so i got to sergei 's at about eleven that morning and found versilov there , finishing what appeared to be a long discourse
0	i could i could stand anything , but mother , how could she ?
0	you won ’ t run wild after i leave , will you ?
0	so i may say that , without being vengeful , i do remember insults
0	when he saw her sleeping , his passion for her flared up
0	but why did you make such a mystery of it ?
0	tell him that god himself has sent him this opportunity
0	ah , mother , mother , you came to visit me only once , and now where are you , my faraway visitor ?
0	so he dragged me out into the street just when the boys were walking home from school , and among them was my ilyusha
0	so what are all these nasty things they have been telling me about you ?
0	but let 's talk seriously now ; the time has come for that and i have loved you for a long time , my boy
0	but that too pleased me
0	i was a bit offended that he felt so sure he could handle me and that it never seemed to occur to him that i might suspect something
0	please , please , pay no attention to this , she went on , as the tears rolled down her cheeks
0	he would received it earlier that day , around five in the afternoon
0	one wonders why the soul should hang on like that in the body and still enjoy being alive
0	i , for one , have heard the story , and i happen to know that inspector makarov has too
0	then paint me the biggest picture you have ever painted , big enough to cover this whole wall
0	god has sent me to tell you this
0	i had intended to say something unpleasant to him about his attitude toward kraft and i had done my best
0	as a matter of fact , that is how the ladies often referred to him , as the naughty tease , and this seemed to delight him
0	i used to bathe him in a trough and he dared to do that to me , gregory repeated
0	the other day he said he wanted to get up , so they dressed him and put on his shoes , and he tried to walk , but he couldn ’ t even stand up , kept falling over all the time
0	i ca not imagine how some people can say that you are a woman swayed by passions !
0	well , precisely , with such a wide-ranging nature , that covers two abysses , karamazov is capable of stopping dead in the middle of the wildest revelry , if the vision of that opposite abyss occurs to him
0	for i can not justify myself to her nor even find the right words to try to make her understand
0	he had encouraged smerdyakov to talk to him , although he was somewhat taken aback by the confusion , or rather the restlessness , of the lackey ’ s thoughts , and wondered what it was that so constantly and persistently disturbed that contemplative mind
0	here , please take it
0	on the other hand , there were so many excellent arguments to convince him to live : that life is transitory , for instance ; that we will all die one day ; or one could show him the statistics on how many children die of scarlet fever
0	mr karamazov cried , tapping himself on the forehead
0	he began to tremble all over then , and the next thing i knew , there he was kissing my hand again
0	oh , he used different words , but that was the general meaning
0	nevertheless , we would still better take a good look at these details
0	but the little boys teased you and you swore to wreak vengeance on humankind
0	rakitin was afraid to say the wrong thing
0	but you must understand that our present earth has repeated itself perhaps as many as a billion times : it died out , got covered with ice , cracked , broke to pieces , decomposed into its original component elements ; and again there was just water above the firmament , then again a comet , again the sun , again the earth from the sun—the process can repeat itself infinitely and always in the same way , over and over again , to the minutest detail
0	give me back my own things at once !
0	did not you notice how painful it was for him to swallow when that gentleman repeated the gossip about the baron and mrs akhmakov ?
0	versilov began , but luckily he was interrupted by someone asking for the landlord , who immediately rushed off
0	forgive me , mr ivan—i did think you were like me
0	when did she say that ?
0	ivan suddenly bent down , picked the man up , and , carrying him on his back , went on until he saw a house with a light inside
0	but this did not prevent her from bearing fyodor karamazov two sons—ivan , in the first year of marriage , and alexei , three years later
0	so you can go on talking drivel until you ’ re blue in the face , you won ’ t make me lose my temper as you did last time
0	now , that was really too much , especially in stebelkov 's presence
0	but the drunken old man went on spluttering , noticing nothing , until something very strange happened to alyosha—an exact repetition of what had happened to the boy ’ s mother on the occasion which he had just recounted
0	and now i met her by the gate
0	you told me—the cellar
0	i can see through you as if you were transparent , ma'am , and still i am not going !
0	i ’ ll bring it to you some time
0	why should i worry about it ?
0	katerina ’ s invitation sounded so imperious that , after a second ’ s hesitation , ivan decided to follow alyosha upstairs
0	pure art , isn ’ t it ?
0	may god grant that your heart find the answer while you are still on this earth , and may he bless you on your journey through life !
0	well then , this is a complete program of the crime , so how can he not be the murderer ?
0	i picked up my hat too and , having asked the landlady to give vasin the message that arkady dolgoruky had been to see him , rushed downstairs
0	you caught me up on my poor phrase
0	and that was jealousy !
0	otherwise , i could not tell my story coherently and would have to present it as a series of riddles
0	still , at the last moment i somehow succeeded in pushing his hand upward and the bullet hit him in the shoulder
0	smerdyakov seemed to think for a while in silence
0	who could it possibly have been ?
0	as soon as he arrived , he contacted a former moscow colleague of his who told him that the outlook for their activities in petersburg was very unpromising—nothing of any scope in sight
0	it was one of those outbursts i had in those days that still give me an unpleasant feeling when i remember them
0	the defense counsel continued to use every possible trick and he astounded everybody by his intimate knowledge of the minutest detail of the case
0	i slept for four hours
0	ivan cried with affected delight
0	it is by discarding cumbersome and unnecessary demands , by subduing and disciplining selfish and conceited aspirations , by obedience , that the monk , with god ’ s help , achieves spiritual freedom and thereby finds spiritual happiness
0	then , abruptly turning away , he started to run
0	here 's another portrait you may want to look at
0	come now—'abyss of degradation !
0	and so the feelings i showed toward lisa and our mutual relations were only an affected coolness , a pretended family rivalry , when in reality we had never loved each other more
0	but try and put a man of letters or a peasant woman in jupiter 's place and you will have one uninterrupted thunderstorm !
0	i suppose he would become somewhat bored , which may happen to anyone but which is nevertheless always hard to analyze
0	for ste-belkov told me quite unashamedly that he suspected that some forbidden , strictly forbidden , activities must be taking place at dergachev 's and that therefore , if i found out something about these activities , i could work myself into an advantageous position
0	besides , if i am not mistaken , that stone is still sitting there and has not been buried in a hole at all
0	i don ’ t know what he thought he saw in my look but the next thing i knew he was rushing at me with his penknife open and he jabbed it into my right thigh , right here , see ?
0	why , i suppose the next step will be to order that i be flogged , for what else is there left ?
0	he certainly wo not spend it here , will he ?
0	how dare you come to the house of a lady who does not know you at such an hour !
0	his apparently distant behavior was due to a constant inner preoccupation with something strictly personal , something which had nothing to do with other people , but which was so supremely important to him that it made him forget the rest of the world
0	obviously , the prosecutor insisted on re-examining the witness and he asked alyosha to describe the scene to him again and made him repeat several times that the accused was actually indicating something definite on his chest , rather than just pounding himself with his fist
0	the other day father paisii described the karamazov drive ’ as earthy , frantic , and primitive , and i don ’ t even know whether there ’ s an awareness of the divine spirit beyond that drive
0	i am sorry , i just ca not get over it !
0	he was , i assure you , an extremely handsome man ; old as he was , he was still wouldark-visaged , tall , and spare , as nekrasov 's line has it , and , on top of that , unaffected and dignified
0	her mother had planned to take her abroad in the spring , but they had been detained throughout the summer by urgent business on the estate
0	i have been screaming about that around town , too !
0	i had left my old quarters after handing in my resignation
0	what ’ s the point of wishing—it ’ s impossible
0	and later , when i would thought it all out , it was already too late
0	i do not believe that : he will never stop loving me , although i may very well be unhappy with him
0	does god exist or not ?
0	all they had to do was break the stone up , i said , beginning to frown
0	he recovered his senses at once and now sounded extremely alarmed
0	i ’ ll fix it up if you ’ ll tell me where it is
0	it was just a short note , only a few lines , which she read in one second
0	i told him plainly that bodily cleanliness was not just the attribute of a dandy , not just a matter of aesthetics , but that it was essential for a doctor , and i convinced him of it
0	ivan asked , exasperated but at the same time full of a strange curiosity
0	i don ’ t know from whom
0	i ’ d like us to get to know each other better
0	indeed , she had not asked me to
0	don ’ t bother with him , papa
0	it looked like a chapel because of its tremendous number of icons with lamps perpetually burning before them , all brought by visitors to the monastery
0	he turned away , walking off with a firm step without looking back
0	his tone was gentle but his voice was highly emotional , almost quavering
0	tiens , what a coincidence !
0	did he tell you , sofia ?
0	he had some very important and even somewhat mysterious business to attend to
0	ah , it would be wonderful to seat mother and nina in the buggy , put ilyusha on the driver ’ s box , and i would run along beside it , watching my family ride
0	can you really remember that ?
0	and your paris story , mr miusov , is quite typical
0	mitya roared , slamming his fist down on the table
0	if you ’ d been a young army officer , a dashing hussar , or something of that sort , you ’ d have drawn your sword and rushed off to fight for russia
0	we must find out because it will soon be time for us to go back
0	such as the time you cried on makar 's shoulder ?
0	that plain started driving me out of my mind
0	unless perhaps you wanted to brag about your success ?
0	and i stood there with a sarcastic smile , listening to his words and looking at the tears in his eyes !
0	as he began his speech , the prosecutor was trembling nervously
0	please come and join us
0	nevertheless , later , after her departure that evening , madame touchard said to me , it looks as if you maman used to be rather pretty once
0	ah , you should see all the tricks he can perform !
0	for there are many like him , alas , although they do not express themselves as cynically as he did , because they are better bred and more polished
0	ivan glanced at him scornfully , shrugged , and turned away to look at the road
0	so one day the boy was running around the yard of the mill when all of a sudden the master , maxim skotoboinikov , drove up on a pair of horses
0	no , i swear it isn ’ t true !
0	and you ’ re not worried about rabies , are you ?
0	besides , it ’ s too late for that now
0	the only reason i ’ m asking you to do it is that you ’ re a clever man , and i ’ m very well aware of it , too
0	in fact , i did not ask him any questions
0	oh , sergei , if that 's the case
0	this is the truth : i used to be your enemy until i discovered your nobility and was utterly conquered
0	guide them onto the path that is right for each one of them , according to your wisdom
0	the reason for this ostracism was something unspeakably vile and , what is worse , something scandalous in the eyes of society that he was supposed to have done a little over a year ago in germany
0	mrs prutkov flared up again
0	as we will never meet again , i do not see why you should care anyway so give me the true answer to a question sensible people never ask : did you , at any time , ever love me or did i just imagine it ?
0	well , i ’ d rather put it this way : you and i , we have the same philosophy
0	at any rate , i heard about certain shares
0	no , i have no witnesses , except for one , perhaps , ivan added with a dreamy smile
0	that you so generously
0	be quiet my heart ,
0	the result was quite different from what he had hoped for
0	sometimes he ’ ll tell such lies that you wonder why he ’ s doing it
0	they flog the girl for one minute
0	versilov was pale and spoke with restraint , as though pouring his words through a funnel
0	there are so many mysteries ; so many riddles that weigh man down to the ground
0	oh , i am not talking about my mother 's respectability , for she 's always been infinitely higher than you in the moral sense , but she is—if you do not mind my saying so—only a morally superior corpse because versilov alone is alive and all the people around him are there only for the privilege of having him feed on their life juices
0	he was dressed very correctly that morning—a frock-coat buttoned up all the way and black gloves , and with a top-hat in his hands , exactly the same clothes as he had worn three days earlier at the elder ’ s , when he had met with his father and brothers at the monastery
0	but to this day i ca not explain why i turned so red and kept staring into his eyes , unable to look away
0	and that was why i did not ask her any additional questions about daria
0	yes , yes , i was just thinking that , but everybody loves it and always , not just at some special moments
0	and never , never say that again , never
0	what did i mean by that ?
0	but if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins as he does it , then he ’ s just trying to take you in
0	it was warm , the snow was melting and had turned dark and ugly , and unpleasant smells wafted from the market square
0	they managed to extract from the lover a tidy little sum without having to take any risks , for , as they well knew , he was only too eager to keep the whole thing quiet
0	don ’ t you agree at least with that ?
0	i ’ ve brought you a little cannon
0	i must say , though , i can ’ t really blame you , for i understand very well that you can ’ t take my word for everything either
0	i knew you ’ d stop by yourself
0	maximov suddenly whispered right into mitya ’ s ear
0	he was a russian gentleman of a certain type , no longer young , qui frisait la cinquantaine , as the french would say , with dark , still-thick hair and pointed beard which were only slightly graying
0	this went on for four years until , finally , dmitry lost patience
0	who is this podwysocki ?
0	i don ’ t give a damn about the pestle !
0	as to what he says about russia , i not only readily believe him , but i welcome it heartily because , if it was generally accepted , it would untie many people 's hands , emancipating them from the prejudice of patriotism
0	he never told me that when telling me about his relations with makar
0	because it 's you who wanted to speak to me , not me to you !
0	my god , what am i doing that for ?
0	sergei finally became fully convinced
0	you swore to her yourself that you would burned kraft 's letter , did not you ?
0	but let pushkin celebrate
0	but she was so completely trusting in her embrace and it obviously never occurred to her that i might become annoyed , although a few seconds earlier she would been smiling so ingratiatingly at me
0	the young prince turned to me with concentrated courtesy , although my name obviously did not ring a bell
0	the crack was tiny and lise ’ s voice had a catch in it—it sounded as if she were making a desperate effort to keep from bursting into laughter
0	and suddenly , my boy , the sun that in the dream was setting on the first day of european civilization turned , upon my awakening , into the sun setting on the last day of our era !
0	but , when it comes to marriage , that 's a different matter
0	mitya , feeling very embarrassed , bent down , and tried to help her , and finally , between the two of them , they managed to slip the icon under his tie and shirt onto his chest
0	then suddenly i felt unbearably disgusted at trying to reconstruct the scene ; i felt sick and angry , both with them and with myself
0	and some , very true
0	and i don ’ t dislike our dear mitya ’ s formulation either
0	but , if i got involved in it now , would i again be caught up like a splinter of wood in a whirlpool ?
0	tn that question , there was a stirring note ; she was deeply moved too
0	in the name of the long ordeal ahead of him , please go and see him now !
0	i don ’ t think he is , at least
0	in the end i pulled aside the curtain that screened off mrs prutkov 's bedroom and started pleading with him to put katerina down on the bed
0	he had thought he would be able to put pressure on smerdyakov by threatening to reveal their conversation , but suddenly it turned out that smerdyakov had already reported it himself
0	oh , sir , it ’ s scary to drive you
0	that smile made maximov ’ s chin jerk and his lips tremble as he dissolved into tears of gratitude
0	what about my room ?
0	he dressed in a russian shirt with the collar buttoned on one side and a long-skirted peasant coat ; he had considerable savings , but constantly dreamed of still better things
0	he seemed to be in a peculiar state of stupid excitement and came toward kolya threatening him with his fist
0	right behind him came his celebrated defense counsel , fetyukovich , and a subdued hum rose from the audience
0	who are you talking about then ?
0	what do you mean—i healed her ?
0	besides , how does one go about founding a city or a state ?
0	it 's either mine or mr versilov 's
0	obviously , i got a good spanking
0	i mean it and i say it once and for all
0	and all i want to say is that your idea of the aristocracy amounts to the rejection of the aristocracy , the prince said
0	look at him , versilov said
0	that , too , was influenced by your humanization of mores
0	then he banged his fist on the table
0	he called to the valet out in the passage
0	without going into details , i will only say that the most common method of operation was to find out certain intimate secrets of persons , sometimes quite respectable as well as respected , in order to threaten them with public exposure backed by documentary evidence ( which did not always even exist ) , and to make them pay for discretion
0	all right , then , give her these three rubles and wrap up , say , ten pies , and tell her to take the package to them
0	his father , the captain , the back-scrubber , you know , well , he said he ’ d bring him a pup today , a real mastiff puppy with a black nose
0	i would always imagined you were one of those young creatures who are aware of their rich endowments and who try to withdraw into themselves
0	there was sincere concern in her voice , as if she were the closest person in the world to him and was now sharing his grief
0	besides , all the wardens were used to alyosha
0	but i don ’ t think it ’ s right
0	but that very same second i saw versilov burst out from behind the door leading into the passage
0	and why , exactly , are you weeping ?
0	don ’ t judge me too harshly , alyosha , my friend
0	this drop in performance was also due in part to that idea , or perhaps , to be more precise , to the conclusions i drew from it , even if they may have been false conclusions
0	after all , a thirteen-year-old schoolboy doesn ’ t believe in these things
0	i also love your cool composure , your calm , smooth , almost lazy way of saying things—yes , it 's that very languor that i love
0	i knew that , after vasin 's father had died , stebelkov was the boy 's guardian , but that they had not been close for years now , that they had quite different interests and led very different lives
0	they manage to live their lives out under the most unfavorable circumstances and remain true to themselves even when everything around them has become completely unfamiliar and strange
0	i don ’ t want you to think , though , that i ’ m really a revolutionary extremist
0	besides , who knows , after all , perhaps such gestures are dictated by the beautiful and sublime ideals inherent in us
0	and i suppose you ’ ll stop loving poor silly me once you ’ ve got to know me better
0	she must have climbed on a chair and then kicked it out from under her and , to prevent it from banging on the floor , she would put a skirt under it
0	i do not even understand now how i could have accepted that money from him yesterday , but he appeared so honorable then !
0	and again , in case of need , he wanted someone to protect him from something unknown but terrifying
0	no , don ’ t waste your breath
0	no , there ’ s no immortality either
0	and he ’ s cunning , with an animal cunning
0	mitya and the little pole sat at the table opposite each other while the huge pan wrublewski stood nearby , his hands clasped behind his back
0	the old man rushed to ivan in terror
0	but , believe me , he realized very well that i knew everything , and also that i was testing him by offering him that money—to see whether he so completely lacked any sense of honor as to accept it
0	i want ten rubles now so i can pay back one ruble to dolgoruky and use the rest to buy a hat for andreyev
0	there was nothing wicked or even sarcastic about the stories we told each other that night ; they were just funny and made us laugh
0	he had pushed himself forward , and he had blundered—blundered in a matter involving love and the emotions connected with it
0	he locked the cupboard , put the key in his pocket , went into the bedroom , lay down exhausted on his bed , and at once fell asleep
0	i am recounting all this in such detail to show the reader how , despite my frequent vows and solemn resolutions to reform and strive for beauty , i could so easily slip into such vulgarity
0	is not everybody free to say what he thinks to thin air ?
0	look at his face , oh
0	mrs prutkov jumped to her feet and snatched the icon from him
0	i was still there , kneeling and praying , the tears rolling down my cheeks , when suddenly the door opened and there he was again
0	he kept asking strange and frightened questions , several times even looked at anna with noticeable suspicion
0	but then the lord said to them : don ’ t moan because from now on you ’ ll get the important people
0	but you must be aware that she 's on bad terms with versilov , that and all the rest , so there 's nothing so strange about my feeling ill at ease
0	after that , he quickly made his first move
0	the blood rushed to my head
0	the lawyer , fetyukovich , usually charges more , but this case has caused such a sensation across the country and received such detailed coverage in the newspapers and magazines that fetyukovich has taken it on more for personal publicity than for any other reason
0	so i have decided not to think of it now : let 's just try and get hold of the money and once we have it we will see
0	i don ’ t know why , but i always say the wrong thing !
0	here , before we ’ ve even left
0	as he used to say himself later , with a nasty snicker : those innocent eyes of hers slit my soul open like a razor
0	his face was sweating
0	i suppose it is
0	sometimes i ’ d even cry out in the darkness
0	i ’ m afraid i did
0	kolya then went out into the hall and opened the door of the room where the children were
0	if you look hard enough for what to do , your life wo not last long enough for you to do it !
0	tell me , what am i to think of that customer ?
0	then let the priest read to the children about the joy of the old patriarch jacob when he learns that his beloved son is alive , about his leaving his native land for egypt and later dying there and announcing before his death the great prophecy that he had concealed throughout his life in his gentle , timid heart—the prophecy that , from his stock , from the hebrews , would come the great hope of the world , who would bring it peace and salvation
0	but how could i not have stayed with that double in there , that double who had smashed the icon before my very eyes !
0	he was sure she wouldn ’ t come , alyosha muttered lamely
0	if the father manages to give him a satisfactory answer , it is a normal family , a family not based on some mystical prejudice , but founded on reasonable , responsible , and strictly humane premises
0	but after such a greeting , he stopped and with sly amusement watched ivan dash upstairs and disappear from sight
0	had you respected him less , you would have demanded less of him and that would have been more like love , for the burden you placed on him would not have been so heavy
0	but did you say good-by to her ?
0	give it back at once
0	yet the young man came and installed himself in his father ’ s house
0	but he would been highly recommended to me
0	when had she gone ?
0	it was one of those moments , familiar to most people , that happen only very rarely , perhaps only once in a lifetime
0	something flashed in the pole ’ s eyes and it looked as if he had made his decision
0	a month earlier , that is , one month before september , while i was in moscow , i made up my mind to break off with them all for good and to devote myself entirely to my idea
0	drunkard and lecher though he was , karamazov was constantly on the lookout for a profitable opportunity to invest some of his capital and , since he was unencumbered by scruples , these ventures were usually quite successful
0	where did you get those eyes , lisa ?
0	gentlemen of the jury , you must remember that i am a stranger here !
0	soon after this gregory and martha reported to their master that smerdyakov had suddenly become peculiarly fastidious
0	versilov snorted in a peculiar way , leaned toward my ear , and , holding onto my shoulder , whispered : he has always lied to you
0	it was only then that i could scream
0	i never believed it !
0	it 's only a shame that you happen to be such a nasty little bastard
0	otherwise he ’ ll treat me just like any other thirteen-year-old , or even like those other little boys , kolya thought
0	why , he also knows that i am a little like him in a way
0	ah , dolgoruky , we all have our memories , you know
0	but that 's just why i have brought you here , he said with an amused smile
0	to my surprise they did not seem angry with me any longer
0	are you trying to drag in that cock and bull story about that crazy epileptic idiot , smerdyakov ?
0	i didn ’ t mean any harm
0	i , for my part , suddenly became excited out of all proportion ( i remember that particular evening very clearly ) and cried out :
0	and , of course , gentlemen , had we found such a shirt among his clothes or in his suitcase—for how could we fail to find it if it existed ? —it would be a piece of evidence , something tangible that would have confirmed the suspect ’ s words
0	that ’ s why , i believe , you don ’ t really realize how thoroughly mr karamazov has been locking himself in at night
0	some of our respectable people claimed she lived the way she did out of sheer pride , but that didn ’ t seem to make much sense : she could not pronounce even one word—now and then she would move her tongue about and produce only a mooing sound—so where was there room for pride in her ?
0	there ’ s nothing in common between us , you idiot !
0	now , smurov , open the door !
0	my plan was to dispose of myself at five in the morning
0	of course , if any intelligent man talked like that , it would be quite another matter !
0	had you accepted caesar ’ s purple , you would have founded a universal empire and given men everlasting peace
0	but i still could not gather up enough courage to disillusion her by telling her frankly that lambert had lied to her , that i would never said a word to him about my devotion to her and , indeed , had never pronounced her name
0	did anyone concern himself with his education ?
0	so always think of the people and preserve the purity of their hearts
0	it was a narrow box of a room and the ceiling sloped up from about the height of my shoulder on one side to the opposite end where i could still put the palm of my hand flat on the ceiling
0	kalganov cried loudly like a young boy hearing something very funny
0	ah , no , he certainly was not up to that
0	i ca not think of anything new you would like for a change , mother protested timidly
0	well , yes , i probably was feverish and , what 's more , i was also crying
0	what are you doing ?
0	then , having settled that , i was determined to say a few words on behalf of anna
0	they just whip it and drive the poor beast on
0	do you remember , there 's a passage—wait , i will have another glass of champagne first—there 's a passage toward the end in which the crazy old man and his charming , thirteen-year-old daughter , after their fantastic escape and wanderings , settle down somewhere in a remote corner of england near some gothic cathedral , and the little girl gets a job as a sort of guide , taking visitors around the church
0	'because that 's how it must be
0	alyosha was roused before dawn
0	he had been extremely curious when kolya had told him that he had suddenly decided to go and see ilyusha precisely today
0	he really horrified our mother and the servants , and me too , for , even though i was just nine years old , i was very frightened when i heard him say that
0	in the meantime , the moscow lady died and mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters
0	i told her i was just about to go out , to which she replied again that she would come for no special reason and that she would leave right away
0	because that ’ s how she is : she ’ ll always do the opposite of what one would expect—but i know her through and through !
0	there was chaos in my head and i probably dozed off very soon
0	i suppose i came up here too soon—you have not cooled off yet and , besides , you ca not stand being criticized
0	christ will never hold it against us if we act out of love
0	he said to me : papa , papa , ah , the way he treated you !
0	but to make up for it , the more i hate individual people , the more ardent is my general love for mankind
0	and i didn ’ t learn of it until three days later , when glafira told me
0	as soon as smurov did so , kolya whistled
0	i could not go on
0	then he again started talking at a tremendous speed , while frantically gesticulating so that i could hardly follow him
0	so i hope it will not be held against me if i report only what particularly struck me and then stuck in my mind
0	he has been living in this town for a long time now , working at odd jobs
0	was it symbolic of something , or what ?
0	outside , in the passage , one climbs on another ’ s back and in they ride
0	this sometimes disappointed him a great deal
0	it met sorrow , wild despair ,
0	no , father , i ’ m not angry—i know your ideas
0	he is sick , almost out of his mind , and he ’ s asking for you
0	he must have squealed an awful lot because the skin inside a dog ’ s mouth is , as you know , extremely tender , in fact , much tenderer than the skin in a human mouth , beyond comparison !
0	luckily my landlord was there too , keeping him company while he waited
0	but since he could not get the document from me , he resigned himself to working with anna rather than losing all prospect of gain , and that 's why he kept offering her his services until the very last moment ; he even told her he could deliver a priest for the marriage ceremony if need be , an offer that anna declined with a scornful smile , telling him not to bother
0	this was not really because he was too embarrassed or too angry with himself—quite the contrary , perhaps—but still , he felt it would not be appropriate for him to attend the party
0	he went back to the station and returned home , his face white as a sheet
0	he fired and the bullet just grazed my cheek , scratching my ear slightly
0	this was where maria kondratiev now lived , old fyodor karamazov ’ s former neighbor , who used to come to his kitchen for a bowl of soup , and to whom smerdyakov used to sing songs to the accompaniment of his guitar
0	the poor man ’ s face looked miserable and frightened
0	and it was in the servants ’ quarters that the boys were found by the rich and eccentric widow of general vorokhov , their mother ’ s former benefactress
0	my god , what will happen to them now ?
0	wake up , please , wake up !
0	by paying him such respect , you acted as if you lacked compassion for him , because you demanded too much of him—and that from you , who love him more than yourself !
0	matvei was supposed to come any moment now
0	for a whole week i worried terribly , for fear he would feel embarrassed in front of me for having kept and spent that three thousand
0	it must be noted , in general , that he was a hot-tempered and rather erratic man
0	and it had all happened as the result of an inspired idea
0	it had got to the point where i started avoiding her as much as i could
0	lambert shouted , really furious now
0	vanya , vanya went to town ,
0	and now that ’ s exactly what happened
0	the white towers and the golden domes gleamed in the sapphire sky
0	i would have found out what 's really going on !
0	he said , jerking his chair forward so that this time their knees actually bumped
0	it would also be unnatural if a man who continuously saved and accumulated money , remained constantly alert , watchful , austere , thrifty , and energetic , failed to end up a millionaire
0	we ’ ve not been nice to her !
0	it ’ s only about nine miles from the volovya railroad station—the road turns to the left there , and you can be in chermashnya in no time
0	by nature , i ’ m a very kindly , cheerful person , you know , who can also enjoy all sorts of amusing social farces
0	indeed , even now as i write i feel a certain pleasure just at the thought of gambling
0	why were you so frightened that he would see me ?
0	whatever is true and beautiful is always full of forgiveness—the elder used to say that too
0	it was the portrait of a girl with a thin , consumptive face , but strikingly beautiful
0	right , right , now everything is coming back to me !
0	there were probably other lodgers besides lambert in that apartment , i thought , frowning under their stares as i approached them
0	and he kept mocking him in that most dignified , apologetic way
0	oh , i , too , i have let myself go unpardonably and am deep in debt too , but i know it 's only a temporary lapse
0	so listen then : legally he doesn ’ t owe me a thing
0	after all , he wasn ’ t afraid to admit that to you , was he , alexei ?
0	he did not budge when he saw me but simply looked at me intently in silence just as i was looking at him , with the only difference that , whereas i stared at him with infinite astonishment , he looked at me without any visible surprise
0	she , on the other hand , took my outcry calmly without any apparent surprise
0	all these stories are epitomes of poor taste , but i assure you that this type of bad taste is much more widely spread and deeply rooted than we suspect
0	listen , if he ’ d just told you vaguely to say good-by to me on his behalf and to give me his best regards , if he hadn ’ t insisted as he did on the word regards ’ —that would have really been the end of everything
0	i want you to know , though , that on this very day men are convinced that they are freer than they have ever been , although they themselves brought us their freedom and put it meekly at our feet
0	what you really want is to keep an eye on me here all the time , you spiteful son , and that ’ s why you don ’ t want to go
0	that ’ s all they are after
0	how could i think of marrying her if i thought he loved her ?
0	nevertheless , i ’ ll swallow my tongue rather than offend the venerable old man whom you respect so highly , he said in concluding the letter
0	you know , i was once bitten by a centipede and was in bed for two weeks with a high fever
0	of course , it could have been just a coincidence , but it was quite uncanny how he could read my innermost feelings with such a frightening insight and penetration !
0	it 's not to reproach you that i have recalled all this , my beloved sofia , it 's only to remind him
0	ah , i can just imagine that unapproachable , truly dignified , and highly intelligent girl working hand in hand with a guttersnipe like lambert !
0	so let him in
0	but this idiot somehow made a very curious observation , one that would have done honor to an infinitely more intelligent observer , and that is why i have brought him in now : of all the sons , he said , the one who is the most like my master is mr ivan
0	the twenty years your mother and i have lived together have been spent in silence , he started off in an affected , unnatural tone , and all that passed between us happened without words
0	and now , why don ’ t you leave me alone ?
0	but before i even had time fully to register my surprise , i heard sergei 's voice : he was talking rather loudly to someone in the corridor
0	all right , i say to myself , so i ’ ll act like a buffoon
0	besides , god knows it happened completely by accident , and afterward i behaved as decently as was within my power , or at least i stuck as close as possible to the standards of human decency as i conceived them at the time
0	you do not suppose that i keep such documents at the place where i live , do you ?
0	besides her eyes , i also liked the oval shape of her face , and i believe that , if her cheekbones had been a bit less wide , one might have called her beautiful even now , let alone in her youth
0	i did not bother to question the nurse , who was an extremely stupid woman , and she was the only adult there
0	here , mother is giving you back your sixty rubles and another twenty
0	and he himself burst into tears
0	and she was wrong about his feelings : he did love his mother and disliked only what he called in his schoolboy lingo that sickening slobbery stuff
0	she said : you were asleep when he came and he didn ’ t want to disturb you
0	so , although i will still start with september , i will first slip in a few words about who i am and where i would been until then , and this will explain , at least in part , what i had on my mind on the morning of september and make things clearer to the reader , and perhaps also to me
0	i had been playing for an hour or more already when suddenly i saw sergei get up from his seat
0	apparently it was because he was going to marry mother
0	the old man took his eyes off the mirror , walked to the window , and suddenly looked out
0	why , i ’ m sure you were talking about me
0	but you already know all that
0	no , no , alexei , please don ’ t say anything , for i have so much to tell you
0	there were many things that frightened him , and he worried constantly—and this would have made it hard if he had not had someone who was loyal to him—and gregory was as loyal a man as anyone could hope to have
0	from what you say , i gather he must have taken it for granted that you would not be able to resist the lure of money
0	from versilov she would inherited perhaps only his slender waist , his tallness , and his characteristic grace of movement
0	all this made alyosha ’ s heart bleed and obviously , as i mentioned before , what hurt him most was that the one he had loved more than anybody in the world now stood dishonored and disgraced
0	the plotnikov store was only two houses away from perkhotin ’ s , right on the corner of the block
0	the day declines and is replaced by the stifling , black southern night of seville
0	please forgive me
0	indeed , as i mentioned earlier , seeing him so cheerful and talkative , they felt there was a noticeable improvement in his health , even if it was only for a short time
0	for a whole hour afterward , i sat weeping with my face buried in my hands
0	and i would know that if i wanted , i would be able to have a better dinner than anyone else that night because i had the best cook in the world , and the awareness of it would be enough for me
0	shall i tell you why ?
0	snegirev asked with a strange note of fear in his voice
0	and after that , when they arrested him in mokroye , i understand he declared that he considered the most disgraceful thing in his life the fact that , while he had the money to pay katerina back one half of what he owed her—he specified one half ’ —and thus not to be an outright thief in her eyes , he preferred to become just that rather than to part with the money
0	then , by my side , he slipped into an easy , sinless sleep
0	he did , indeed , and he told me all the facts but quite unemo-tionally
0	the reader will , of course , notice that i am not sparing myself anything , although i do give myself credit when it is due
0	and after that you will be free to go and till the soil !
0	she may not forgive him , even if the child chooses to forgive him himself
0	however , i preferred the little backstreets and dark alleys to the large lighted squares , because all kinds of unexpected things happen there , because in the filthy gutters i felt i could find natural human gems
0	and , knowing that , she still wants to marry bjoring ?
0	as you wish
0	no , they won ’ t starve , because they ’ ll get that two hundred rubles , whatever happens
0	my god , what a dirty trick !
0	that ’ s not the important thing i wanted to talk to you about now
0	and now , suddenly , they both felt as if they had been transported back to the old days in moscow , two years before
0	and by honoring you without envy , i show you my human dignity
0	i decided to go and see sergei in the evening so that we could discuss things freely and at length
0	let 's go right away !
0	besides , even if she had not died , perhaps it would not have worked out
0	what ’ s happened to her , anyway ?
0	we should at least apologize for what happened at the elder ’ s and explain that it was really none of our doing , don ’ t you think ?
0	my final choice was nikolai semyonovich , who had been my guardian in moscow and was the husband of my dear friend maria
0	besides , mr dmitry feels that that three thousand is in a way his by right , as he told me himself : i still have three thousand rubles of my money coming to me from my father
0	you must be raving really , ivan said with a faint , twisted grin , his eyes fastened on alyosha like tentacles
0	when mitya had left , samsonov , pale with rage , told his son to see to it that that good-for-nothing was never allowed into the house again , otherwise
0	but she just keeps repeating , if i fancy , i get up ; if i don ’ t
0	no , no , do not take it back , she replied cuttingly , i feel rather flattered at being the bane of your existence
0	i want to be able to go back to her and tell her that you are not worrying about her , that you are all right
0	his views and teachings , uttered at different times and prompted by different circumstances , are gathered and arranged into what is , perhaps , a meaningful whole
0	'if you are religious , he would tell them , 'why are not you a monk ?
0	so you see what a bitch i am , i whom you called your sister !
0	later the prince told me that i would turned so pale that he would been very frightened
0	still , the hell with it , it ’ s up to you
0	but what will i do with this ?
0	grushenka stood up too , but unhurriedly
0	it would be difficult to explain why he had been so indifferent
0	he also remembered that he took out of his pocket a new white handkerchief , which he had carefully taken before going to see mrs khokhlakov , and tried senselessly to wipe the blood off gregory ’ s forehead and cheeks
0	i am no longer used to stairs
0	but here comes sergei !
0	he had heard a lot about him from the boys , but up till now he had always feigned a contemptuous lack of interest and if he said anything it was only to challenge the praises he heard
0	so he 's here , he has not left !
0	i want to save him once and for all
0	besides , of course , i ’ ll give it back
0	she brought it all on , and that ’ s the truth !
0	why do you think i was so anxious to see you just now and these few past days ?
0	after that , the two princes sokolsky had a private five-minute conversation in the old prince 's bedroom and , when they emerged , sergei said to me in a loud voice :
0	but this time i had rubber galoshes on and it proved much harder than i would expected
0	there are all kinds of peasants , kolya told smurov when they had walked on in silence for a while , so i couldn ’ t really know in advance that i ’ d come across a smart one
0	his face was as white as the sheets of his bed
0	there are many contemplators among the simple people
0	something to think about certainly !
0	and i have also learned that it is not only impossible to live a crook , it is also impossible to die one
0	i was glad to find something to take his thoughts off those painful things
0	most of those listening to him were very moved , although some were rather bewildered by his words and found them obscure
0	but i did feel sad
0	katerina screamed furiously , losing all control of herself
0	i had not intended to say that
0	when , that time , i dozed off for a few seconds , sitting on the edge of his sofa , he immediately felt my pocket and became convinced that the letter was there
0	mr karamazov had never been a religious man and it may be that until then he had never even placed a five-kopek candle before an icon
0	in the end he felt sickened by the girls ’ songs which , as they became more and more drunk , gradually became more and more outspoken and dirty
0	besides , god almighty himself , even if he decides to punish the tartar after he dies ( since it ’ s impossible not to punish him at all ) , would give him only a very small punishment , considering that a tartar can not be blamed for having been brought into this world by infidel parents
0	his eyes were completely dry
0	and before , while he was still in the army , he thought nothing of spending a thousand or two on seducing respectable young ladies ; that ’ s something i ’ m very well informed about , dmitry , in every detail , and i ’ ll prove it when the time comes
0	grushenka , although she offered her hand quite willingly , watched katerina with a charming , nervous little laugh , obviously enjoying having her hand kissed by the lady she addressed as miss katerina
0	i would forgotten to burn it the day before yesterday
0	i must not , however , pass over in silence another strange feeling that arose , although only briefly , at that fateful and confusing moment in alyosha ’ s life
0	i insist we have bells , though
0	only , if you start , i ’ ll have to tell them everything i know , for how else do you expect me to defend myself ?
0	mother cried out in alarm
0	is there anyone here who would dare to bestow upon her the sacred title of mother ?
0	the righteous man passes away , but his light remains
0	as though he ever tried to put on an act !
0	if someone should read what i have written thus far of my adventures , he certainly would not have to be told that i am not well fitted for social life of any kind
0	alyosha raised his head from the ground and sat up , leaning against a tree
0	but what i really meant to ask you was this : you stated in your deposition that you were very well acquainted with miss svetlov
0	and perhaps there will be something more to be said about it
0	he turned his head slightly and made a sign to the lackey and the doorman
0	the end of me ?
0	it 's the same as ten half-imperials
0	grushenka got up quickly , looking terribly frightened
0	my instinctive servility was useful in this case : i tried hard to please him and felt not in the least insulted because i did not understand yet about these things
0	the story made a very grim impression on the audience and the effect was strengthened by the calm way in which the old servant told it , without any superfluous words and in his own language
0	although he had been waiting for the servant so eagerly , kolya did not interrupt the performance and kept perezvon dead until he decided it was long enough
0	but i knew that there were many places he could go now , for he had of late reestablished his connections with petersburg high society , which he had severed during the previous year
0	i stretched out on the sofa and , staring at his back , thought at length about various matters
0	i am gripped by a new sensation that i never even suspected existed ; i can not describe it , but it 's so powerful , as powerful as the whole world
0	have a good sleep , i said , and you will see that when you wake up things will look less hopeless
0	we were still so young then and were still fervently waiting for something
0	perhaps they will introduce some innovations , and perhaps they wo not
0	then , on the following day , they quarreled
0	at first he was going to marry her himself , but he decided not to because she turned out to be lame
0	why are you telling me all this , ivan ?
0	it 's a very urgent matter
0	it was not that he was afraid of what she might do or anything like that—it just made him stop and think
0	what this idea of mine actually is , i will have lots to say about later
0	within myself i ’ ve renounced my faith—that ’ s for sure
0	i ’ ll show you a trick now , karamazov , a kind of theatrical performance , kolya said with a nervous laugh
0	in his weak , emotional state , richard kept tearfully repeating again and again : this is the best day of my life , for i am joining the lord !
0	i hope you won ’ t laugh at me if i tell you that this question has prevented me from falling asleep for two nights in a row
0	the little pole kept repeating scornfully , his face the color of a carrot
0	i believe in his word , toward which the universe is striving , the word that itself was with god ’ and that , indeed , is god—well , and so on and so on and on , to eternity ; so much has been said on that subject
0	after the emancipation of the serfs , versilov served as an arbitrator of claims between former serfs and their landlords and , i understand , he performed his duties very well
0	the gorgeous autumnal flowers in the flowerbeds by the buildings were asleep until morning
0	what is love to a daughter is death to a mother , and i might just as well be in my grave
0	for the last time , i tell you : i did not kill him !
0	i know it isn ’ t right
0	oh , it ’ s you , ivan said coldly
0	there was something about him that struck her as uncanny ; she would never have expected him to behave and speak as he was doing in those circumstances
0	so i take a few steps in that direction and listen
0	ivan was attended by dr varvinsky and dr herzenstube , since the moscow doctor had returned to moscow , refusing to commit himself on the probable outcome of the illness
0	haven ’ t you had enough nonsense yet ?
0	and behind me there was nothing but disgrace and gregory ’ s blood now
0	and that 's how it will always be
0	yes , yes , we will cry
0	but that is the only reservation i will make out of the hundred-odd that occurred to me
0	all right , you can have five
0	her tone showed that she was still terribly afraid that , for some reason or other , they might refuse to listen to her
0	you are frightening him , the doctor said firmly
0	the prosecutor then dwelt in great detail on mitya ’ s preparations for the party , first at perkhotin ’ s , then at the store , and then with the drivers
0	and he will also pay me back a debt that does not involve money
0	obviously this was humiliating and i decided to do something about it
0	such disorderly behavior in our streets gets unbearable in its ugliness
0	another great heart belonging to another great being—the heart of his mother—knew that he had not come down only for his great sacrifice but that his heart was open to the simple and artless joys of the plain , uneducated people who had warmly invited him to a humble wedding
0	now , what else would you like to know ?
0	quite right too , mrs prutkov agreed impetuously
0	i know i ’ m unworthy of your generosity , maximov said in a tearful voice ; perhaps you ’ d do better to be generous with people whom you need more than you need me
0	they ’ ve all been bribed
0	now , wouldn ’ t you agree , for instance , that the christian religion has mainly served the interests of the rich and the powerful by enabling them to enslave the lower classes ?
0	to make at least one fellow creature happy , i mean truly happy , during one 's lifetime—i would make that the binding duty of every civilized person , just as i would make it the binding duty of every russian peasant to plant at least one tree in his lifetime to counteract the deforestation of russia
0	in fact , i ’ ve never seen two men get along so famously !
0	and he is sorry for her for a long time and then he gets attached to her so that it becomes impossible for him to break it off , my boy , if you see what i mean
0	my god , madam , you ’ ve saved my life !
0	her pale , sallow face was contorted , her eyes were afire
0	i arrived at the address , entered the yard , and , following the instructions in the advertisement , found mrs lebrecht 's apartment
0	and this is especially true in our age , in which you have managed to change so many things for the worse
0	he seemed terribly wound up
0	but please forgive me , lisa , i am talking like a fool because i know that i am offending you , i realize that
0	cold shivers ran down my spine as i listened to her
0	so he was lying to me shamelessly !
0	i will follow you wherever you go , i said , giving myself to him totally
0	i seized my cap and rushed toward my overcoat
0	do you remember my coming back for the second time that night , around midnight , when i told you to remember my second visit ?
0	it had started when i was sixteen
0	no , no , i still do not know !
0	i will save you all , but i will do it my way , as i explained to you before
0	he needs some rest
0	you should have seen his eyes—he was so proud
0	he said , turning again to ilyusha
0	he gave vent to his irritation quite freely , especially at dinner , and , in general , behaved like a real despot
0	well , that ’ s very possible , gentlemen !
0	but this time i somehow felt an acute pity for her
0	that 's none of your business
0	i saw you often at countess verigin 's last year , darzan said
0	now if you do not get the boy 's likeness at all or if you get it just a little bit , i will still pay you fifty rubles , but if the likeness is really good , i will come up with a whole two hundred
0	i stood up and said cuttingly that , under these circumstances , i could not accept any money from him , that i would probably been either deliberately or unintentionally led to believe by my family that a salary was to be paid to me so that i would not turn the job down at once ; however , i appreciated perfectly well now that no salary should be forthcoming since i had done nothing here to earn it
0	it 's funny , i have always been crazy about nuts , ever since i was a small child , and i still am—the most ordinary nuts too
0	i was trotting be-hind him , for i was afraid of the gun he was still clutching in his right hand ; he would forgotten all about it , and it was awfully close to her head
0	what makes you think i am one of you ?
0	have you ever asked him whether he believes that ?
0	as a matter of fact , only tatyana prutkov and i ever speak of katerina around here , and at that only in secret
0	these spoiled society ladies , when they get an idea into their heads , won ’ t spare a thing to see their whims realized
0	i have been—if i may put it this way—a martyr for honor , a kind of diogenes going about with a lantern and looking for honor in the dark
0	what i most wanted to find out was about those chains he was supposed to have worn and that 's why i kept insisting
0	wait , karamazov , perhaps you ’ ll find out something in a moment
0	and then on the way home you would get so tired that i would have to carry you and you would fall asleep in my arms
0	the hell with all this spying on the human heart !
0	mitya became terribly frightened
0	some may object that he was drunk when he wrote it , but that changes nothing ; if anything , it makes it more important : when drunk he wrote something that he had decided when he was sober , for if he had not conceived the idea when he was sober , he would not have written it down when he was drunk
0	by the way , i was struck at once by the friendly familiarity with which makar and the doctor talked to each other , and it did not please me at all
0	and for my part , i can guarantee that sum , for which i am so infinitely grateful to you , and i would like to offer you the following plan , which
0	such judgments found among the people are sometimes striking in their originality !
0	why couldn ’ t it have actually happened ?
0	overwhelmed by disgust , i jumped up from the sofa
0	but she did not cry , proud as she was : instead , it made her indignant , my story
0	he waited quietly for a minute and then walked stealthily across the lawn , keeping close to the trees and bushes , muffling each step and constantly listening to make sure he made no noise
0	in short , a most chaotic and absurd party was under way
0	just imagine that , and i won ’ t repeat the horrid phrase they used !
0	i shall report you all !
0	he snatched up a fork and stuck it into my leg
0	charity is part of his aristocratic tradition , or perhaps he even has a personal inclination for it
0	and so i walk and i imagine i see her
0	that wild question clutched at his heart
0	but he had heard about the sixth thousand and admitted that he had been standing next to mitya when mitya said it
0	on the third day after the arrest , grushenka had been taken ill , and she was very ill for almost five weeks
0	why did you do that , vanya ?
0	perhaps a whole constellation
0	but enough of this
0	had you been willing to give them bread , you would have satisfied the eternal craving of both individual man and human society as a whole—to have someone to worship
0	what infuriated me most was all these idiotic secrets and intrigues , without which these people apparently could not live
0	miusov gazed abstractedly at the graves in the churchyard and was about to remark that the dead had to pay a very high price for the privilege of being buried in this holy place , but he let it pass , for his usual ironic liberal tone was turning into something like anger
0	when alyosha entered , she too gave him a look of unconcealed disgust
0	you were really full of appreciation
0	for heaven 's sake , do not tell me , there 's no need
0	versilov rushed after me
0	he said in a gentle tone
0	she still had not quite taken hold of herself
0	some phrase , is not it ?
0	he stopped going to his mill , stopped listening to people
0	ivan cried , flaring up again
0	it was he who told it to me
0	yes , as of today , i shall never abandon him !
0	in the end , of course , the gate was opened
0	i must ask you once more , gentlemen , to excuse me if i refuse to discuss this subject any further , miusov repeated
0	i sensed that it was some external shock that had caused his present expansiveness with me
0	b-but how would that be possible ?
0	that is , if he had the money to take her away with
0	it took my breath away to think about it
0	i can ’ t with these people
0	i would seize his hands and i would find the right words in my heart
0	the old man , a most astute businessman , was ( he has been dead for some time now ) quite a personality himself
0	this has been tested
0	that 's what her behavior with me was like
0	so number two becomes number one and number one becomes number two
0	well , i guess i ’ ll be going
0	the foul quagmire in which he was sinking of his own volition made him sick and , like so many others under such circumstances , he believed in the magic of a change of place—just to get away from this spot , to be surrounded by different people , to be in a different situation , where everything would be new and different !
0	there are secrets with nothing criminal or even sinful about them whose exposure may terrify the most honorable and even strong-minded people
0	the devil himself will trip over his own feet
0	the bed next to his was occupied by a tradesman who was swollen with dropsy and was obviously not going to live more than two or three days , so he could hardly be a serious hindrance to their conversation
0	tell me , perkhotin , would you be interested in gold mining ?
0	that ’ s not what i want—i feel gay and i want you to be gay
0	but that 's fine with me , i will leave you since i ca not force you to like me
0	i said it deliberately , to offend him , for he had never , never once , tried to convince me that dmitry was the murderer ; on the contrary , it was i who kept telling him that !
0	it is the most terrible moments of their lives that people remember best
0	you ’ ve come to see me and you despise me in my own house
0	i hope you will forgive me this trivial simile , fetyukovich went on , because i am not very good at elegant phrasemaking
0	if you really have something
0	the next day the doctor came and said we had sent for him too late ; when i begged him , perhaps with a tinge of reproach , to do something , he gave me that final majestic excuse : i am not god , after all , am i ?
0	i recognize his love for mankind as an absolutely sincere and profound feeling , without any pretense , and his love for mother as something beyond dispute , albeit perhaps somewhat implausible
0	kill him if you wish
0	the washing operations began
0	but never mind , we ’ ll catch up
0	so isn ’ t it in a way the same thing—in a different form , of course ?
0	anyway , they had to have a scapegoat , so they made me write my column of criticism and that made life possible
0	look how pretty he is , grushenka said , taking mitya to him
0	ah , my sweet little alyosha !
0	i know i can ’ t express it properly , but i ’ ll say it all the same , alyosha went on in the same trembling , faltering voice
0	they all say he will be acquitted while the other man , stebelkov , will be found guilty
0	it ’ s amazing , though—i used to consider you an educated man
0	i have been preparing myself to speak up for three years
0	so you see , i ’ m going to chermashnya
0	i can see that right away
0	i confess that i did feel a slight buzzing in my head from the three glasses of champagne and two glasses of sherry i would drunk
0	this he did when the prosecutor mentioned grushenka and what rakitin thought of her
0	by the way , in moscow not long ago , a bulgarian told me , ivan went on , ignoring alyosha ’ s remark , of the atrocities committed all over his country by turks and circassians , who , fearing a general uprising of the slav population , set villages afire , rape women and children , nail their prisoners to fences by the ears and leave them in that state until morning , when they hang them , and who commit other atrocities that are difficult even to imagine
0	i do not understand that reasoning—it 's too abstract for me , i went on
0	good , i ’ m glad you did
0	he and alyosha were good friends
0	you can not imagine how impudent he was , alyosha
0	and here he added parenthetically that if there was any natural law , it was precisely this : destroy a man ’ s belief in immortality and not only will his ability to love wither away within him but , along with it , the force that impels him to continue his existence on earth
0	suddenly the gun flashed through the air : he would swung at her with it
0	so now , alyosha , that you know the whole truth , you can see what a frantic , violent creature i am !
0	they immediately became silent when they saw me
0	even if he walks away unmoved by your embrace , laughing at you , do not let it deter you ; it only means that his time has not yet come—and it will come in due course
0	but when i got close to my mother 's house , i suddenly remembered the wicked things lisa had said about anna
0	i yelled , spitting out the words , syllable by syllable
0	when he removed the wrapping , ivan saw that it contained three rolls of rainbow-colored hundred-ruble bills
0	why did you turn that way ?
0	he walked up and down the room , looking worried
0	but she ’ s kind and wonderful and generous , she said in a half whisper
0	i ’ m not leaving yet , kolya quickly said to ilyusha
0	and why don ’ t you dare ?
0	as to his prisoner , he may have been struck by the man ’ s looks
0	you ’ re a lousy little crook , that ’ s what you are !
0	somehow i believe that there is a great deal of corruption in america too
0	now , that does it !
0	so who told me something about spiritualism ?
0	ah , so you think so too ?
0	ah , quelle charmante personnel what do you think ?
0	what we heard during her last appearance on the witness stand was not testimony , but the frantic outcry of a resentful and vengeful woman
0	ivan recognized her writing at once
0	of course , we shall not repeat here what the reader already knows
0	i somehow feel rather sick and tired of everything today
0	he shouted after his son
0	that , of course , caused a terrible commotion
0	but then one day , when smerdyakov was fifteen , karamazov noticed that he was reading the titles of the books through the glass of the bookcase
0	i was not jealous because i was so happy at the time ; in fact , this difference rather pleased me
0	that ’ s true , he said with a smile , a bitter smile , though
0	it was said that our prosecutor , ippolit kirillovich , was terrified of fetyukovich and that they had been old enemies since the days in petersburg when they were starting out on their careers
0	that ’ ll add to the stinging effect , he declares and proceeds to use them on the little girl
0	ivan was puzzled again
0	i guess i must have picked it up somewhere or other
0	yes , i had something in mind before , but things are changed ; it ’ s quite different now
0	and then one day the family of the accused approached me and asked me to handle his defense
0	it looks as if we shall
0	probably smerdyakov was one of them ; most likely he , too , was eagerly collecting the sensations he experienced , although hardly aware of it himself
0	there ’ s something i ’ ll tell you tomorrow
0	well , i do not know whether her words really apply to all idealists , but i am sure they fit him perfectly
0	it sounded as if rakitin knew a great deal , as if he had seen everything , been everywhere , spoken to everybody , was familiar with every detail of fyodor karamazov ’ s life story and , indeed , of the life stories of all the karamazovs
0	she had been quite upset by mitya ’ s visit and felt that she would not escape the migraine from which she usually suffered after a commotion of that kind
0	without having the sense to count them , i scooped up my bills and gold into the palms of my hands
0	i see him every day , and every time he surprises me
0	of course , it was sheer coincidence
0	please take in what i am saying , andrei , for i did want to come and see you now ; you have always been and still are infinitely dear to me
0	but why should anna get it into her head that you might want to marry katerina ?
0	why am i in such a hurry , though ?
0	what are you trying to say ?
0	when it comes to coffee , pies , and fish soups—my smerdyakov is a real artist
0	never before had katerina made such admissions to alyosha
0	i was in a great hurry , that day , to get to a diplomatic reception given by a prominent petersburg lady , who was trying to get a ministerial post for her husband
0	recently , just since i came to petersburg , certain railroad shares were put on the market and the people who bought them made quite a handsome profit , for some time the shares kept rising
0	the righteous , the saints , the holy martyrs—they were all happy people
0	indeed , something quite incredible was taking place in the cell
0	besides , all that is de l'inconnu , but i do think it was quite improper for a gentleman
0	there i would meet versilov 's son , who had just arrived from petersburg and was staying with prince v , a friend of his from boarding school days
0	it is late at night , it is dark , and he is mad with jealousy
0	i would rather go on working , papa , i would not feel right without it
0	as if conscious of his subordinate and dependent position , of not being their equal , he did not greet the visitors
0	the elder zosima lives in the hermitage , he lisped
0	everything i have to say you already know—i can read it in your eyes
0	you have heard , have not you , about those people , you know ?
0	and my coat 's in the hall
0	worse than that , they do not even bother to hide from their children their great delight at their sudden discovery of the right to dishonor that will enable them to satisfy their greed , a right based on a certain species of reasoning accepted wholesale by so many
0	but why bother analyzing feelings ?
0	the next day i sent smurov to inform ilyusha that i was no longer talking to him , which meant that our relations were broken off
0	the doctor waved his hand impatiently in front of his face
0	oh , in the absurd , carefree , irresponsible state of mind i was in at the time , i could have wiggled out of this difficulty by some noble gesture , by some high-sounding phrase , or something of that sort , had i not suddenly noticed the angry , accusing look under lisa 's frown
0	later , karamazov swore he had left with the rest of the gang , and it may have been quite true : no one has ever known for sure
0	but let us leave it for the time being
0	he even married off his hall porter 's daughter
0	as a matter of fact , he spoke of practically nothing else
0	the best feelings i ’ m capable of , such as gratitude , are forbidden to me , just because of my official social position
0	that man was locked inside me , but he would never have come out if it hadn ’ t been for this terrible blow of fate
0	and i want you to note that he wouldn ’ t be hurting mitya ; indeed , mitya would be indebted to him for as long as he lived
0	i started accumulating some capital
0	the birds had quieted down and now and then a fish would splash in the water
0	arkady , how well do you know mamma ?
0	he understood that it would be too painful for someone like mitya to find himself suddenly surrounded by thieves , swindlers , and murderers , and that he ought to be given a chance to get used to them
0	he hadn ’ t expected financial assistance from any quarter , and such a substantial sum was beyond his wildest dreams
0	it was just by accident
0	you do pray before going to sleep , do not you ?
0	i am not sure i can make it clear , but his whole being was outraged that such a thing could have happened to him
0	and even if this should not happen till the end of time , happen it will because it has been so ordained
0	then , i suddenly let go and fell down on the floor
0	and you , mother , do you remember coming to the village where i lived until the age of six or seven ?
0	then he went in for philanthropy on a large scale , donated an immense amount of money to charities in our town , became known in the capitals , and was elected to national charity committees in moscow and in petersburg
0	for , although those who had gathered around him that evening knew that death was near , they never thought it would be so sudden
0	oh , there ’ s nothing much to tell really
0	the little pole looked very bored
0	for it would be an artistically convincing picture of a russian illusion , but an illusion that really existed until some people decided that it had never been anything but an illusion
0	did you get that , by any chance , from that father paisii of yours ?
0	and that made it all the more difficult for him to give her the message he had for her
0	in that sense , i am just like mr versilov
0	yes , because even if the court doesn ’ t believe what i ’ ve said to you today , the public will believe it and you ’ ll feel ashamed
0	but at times something seemed to come over him : he would question god 's existence and say all sorts of very strange things , obviously challenging me to answer him
0	do not do anything horrible to yourself , god forbid
0	a little vertical line had appeared between her eyebrows , which gave her beautiful face a look of thoughtful concentration and , at first glance , made it appear almost austere
0	what about his opinion that you were so terribly anxious to hear ?
0	i was like a gambler who intends to place a stake but , before doing it , feels : if i want to , i will put it down ; if i want to , i can walk out
0	that more than anything else will make you reconsider many things
0	but even if gregory is alive , even so
0	i come from a small monastery , st sylvester in obdorsk , the visiting monk said in a humble tone , watching the hermit out of quick , curious , and somewhat frightened eyes
0	so all of them had to gather in makar 's room just when i least wanted to see them !
0	now he took a step toward me
0	you ’ ll pay me back some day
0	i certainly hope he won ’ t—that would really be the last straw !
0	most probably , he was absolutely sincere in his generous impulse in the first instance , and just as sincere in his villainy in the second
0	in the course of his life , he came in contact with some of the most liberal minds of his era , both in russia and abroad
0	he yelped and jumped , begged and walked on his hind legs , lay on his back with his paws pointing at the ceiling , stretched himself out motionless as if he were dead
0	your money or your life !
0	you should be able to get up with it , lisa suggested impatiently
0	so you are leaving town again ?
0	what can i think of these people after this ?
0	maria , the daughter of the landlady , was wearing a light blue dress with a six-foot train
0	that ’ s no carp for you !
0	but look , see for yourselves , it tells you everything in advance , and when he actually did kill his father , he followed it point by point—it contains his whole program !
0	i yelled , trying to shake them off
0	she stood there with a terrified expression holding her clasped hands in front of her
0	they will also discover that men can never be free because they are weak , corrupt , worthless , and restless
0	as i sat by his bed one night , he said to me : papa , when they fill my grave , i want you to scatter some bread crumbs on top of it , so the sparrows will come and i ’ ll have company there and it will be fun !
0	i ’ m the first to love him
0	she went on exclaiming
0	his father , because earlier in life he had scrounged off other people , had developed a special sensitivity to people ’ s attitudes and was prepared to interpret anything as a personal slur
0	but what the hell , i really can ’ t stay here and be their keeper
0	but all their aspirations came to nothing ; some of those who sought her favors had to beat an undignified retreat and became the butt of general jokes , for she had a special firm and mocking way of rejecting unwanted advances
0	you ’ re spitting now , you pole , mitya said in despair , realizing that he had failed , because you reckon that you ’ ll be able to get more out of grushenka—you ’ re a couple of capons , that ’ s what you are !
0	the first room after the entry was packed with people , perhaps as many as thirty persons , half of whom were busy bargaining while the rest looked like auction lovers , mrs lebrecht 's representatives , and just plain curious passers-by
0	is that all there is ?
0	that ’ s not at all what you said a little while ago , katerina whispered barely audibly , not at all
0	we were already in the street by the time i would uttered the last disconnected sentences
0	the elder turned suddenly to look attentively at alyosha , who then walked over to lise and , smiling awkwardly , gave her his hand
0	but it would be easier for me to imagine a hell without a ceiling—that would be more refined , more enlightened , more lutheran , that is
0	please , any other time , he muttered
0	le grand dadais literally tore the money out of his hand :
0	they roasted the nightingale and brought it to the merchant
0	they all lost their heads ; they had a whole to-do about it in the city council
0	indeed , we are even obsessed—yes , obsessed—with the most noble ideals , if , that is , we happen to stumble on such ideals by chance , if they fall into our laps from the sky , and as long as we don ’ t have to pay for them
0	the chilly evening air refreshed him
0	fyodor karamazov , he could have conceivably done it for money , namely , to take the three thousand rubles that he had seen his master put into the envelope
0	and they filled them up to the brim
0	versilov lives in litvinov 's house , which is on mozhaisk street , near the semyonovsky regiment barracks
0	it was closed all the time i was in the garden , up to the moment i ran away
0	she sent for me and i must go and see her now , alyosha said , getting up determinedly
0	and to think that this was the only time in my life i tried my hand at it !
0	true , i always want to get my revenge whenever i am insulted , morbidly so perhaps , but only by overwhelming my offender with my magnanimity
0	the boys at school were the most insulting of all
0	yes , i am sure anna wants me to be there !
0	perhaps it was because he was so disgusted by the monstrousness and the horror of his rivalry with his own father over this woman that , at the time , he could not imagine anything worse or more threatening
0	i had carefully made a bundle of the most indispensable things to take with mo
0	and you saw those chains yourself , did you ?
0	mitya greeted those he already knew with a hug , trying hard to remember whether he had seen some of the faces before
0	so how could you tell me in advance exactly when you would fall down those cellar stairs in an epileptic fit , unless you were planning to sham it ?
0	ah , don ’ t start philosophizing now , you fool !
0	come into the other room with me
0	a person who 's not concerned with russia 's present is not a worthy citizen
0	well , do not you think that was quite a shrewd appraisal of my character ?
0	we ’ d put mother and the girls in the buggy and cover them with blankets , and the two of us would walk alongside ; now and then he would climb into the carriage too , for a ride and a rest , while i would have to walk all the way , because we had to think of the horse
0	and why should he soak his handkerchief in the blood of this new victim , thus leaving one more clue that may lead to him ?
0	what is this about the state being eliminated and the church raised to the status of a state !
0	how dare he ask me those questions ?
0	so how can you break the engagement if she doesn ’ t want it broken ?
0	the long-legged one growled suddenly
0	the visitor prostrated himself before the holy man and asked for his blessing
0	there ’ s nothing more to explain—you ’ ll find the rest out for yourself
0	it was not true
0	but , in the first place , this letter was written by someone who was very drunk and in a state of great nervous tension
0	the prosecutor intervened , repeating once more to mitya that he did not have to answer any questions if he thought that not answering them would be to his advantage , etc , etc
0	she has the bearing of a lady of the highest society , he once blurted out in the presence of some ladies
0	and he was suddenly seized by such an irresistible urge to speak to fenya , to find out as much as he could from her , that he abruptly turned around and walked quickly toward the house of mrs morozov , grushenka ’ s former landlady
0	i just remember that i suddenly felt an overwhelming desire : i could climb up on top of the wall , i could do it very easily , i said to myself when , only a few steps away from me , i discovered a gate that probably remained locked for months on end
0	miusov , too embarrassed to go on , was about to walk out of the room
0	for he would immediately be offered food and shelter ; and if no one offered him anything , he would find everything he needed right away himself , and it would cost him no effort , nor make him feel in the least humiliated , nor , for that matter , would he be imposing himself on others ; just the contrary , they would all be only too happy to do things for him
0	don ’ t you realize he ’ s gone mad ?
0	lambert asked from behind the screen
0	who am i to bless them ?
0	i had seen her three or four times while i was living in moscow when she turned up from god knows where and , on someone 's instructions , arranged things for me—to get me into touchard 's school and two and a half years later to have me transferred to high school and installed in the house of the late nikolai semyonovich
0	yes , a maniac , a maniac !
0	i kissed her , and let me add parenthetically that since that day mrs prutkov and i have always remained pretty good friends
0	i saw clearly that mr perkhotin had interfered with his plans , for i think that mr rakitin was about to tell me something after he had read me his poem
0	suppose the boy was bitten by a rabid dog and then goes around biting other people
0	what time was it ?
0	she turned away from him without answering
0	he indulged in sweet things ; he liked to have his tea with the cherry jam that was sent him by rich ladies
0	also i still do not believe that you are telling me the truth even now
0	there have been many great nations with a glorious past history , but the higher the stage of development they reached , the greater was their discontent , because they became more and more obsessed with the need for universal unification
0	the organ that was playing , the people who were drinking and eating around me , and the bleak lighting have probably left a mark on my soul that will be there as long as i live !
0	were you hoping to find me changed then ?
0	alyosha stood up and walked over to rakitin
0	ivan came in very , very slowly , his head down , and not looking at anyone , as though he were trying hard to work something out
0	that ’ s what i ’ m afraid of
0	there are times when i must sound terribly immature and that ’ s because , when i ’ m pleased about something and don ’ t restrain myself in time , i ’ m likely to say heaven knows what
0	despite her fear of him , which i have also noticed , she 's always had a great trust and admiration for his code of behavior and his high-mindedness , ever since they first met
0	this is no place for me , he thought to himself
0	i am forced to maneuver cunningly to avoid the snares set for me by that unspeakable woman , and i find it all absolutely unbearable !
0	they wish god did not exist
0	here i ’ ve written you a love letter
0	from my ravings , disconnected utterances , mutterings , and exclamations , lambert learned all the exact names , family names , and even sometimes the addresses he needed
0	my only wish is to have my fill of looking at you all
0	so the rooms were familiar and the waiters recognized me as an old customer
0	on the previous night , however , i would heard my mother whispering to my sister , so versilov would not hear ( not to worry andrei ) , that she intended to take to the pawnshop an icon which , for some reason , was particularly dear to her
0	if you want to do something to help him , do it !
0	they would then force the crazy gallop of our unbridled passions to a stop in the name of their own salvation , in the name of enlightenment and civilization !
0	rumor had it that you were looking for juchka and that you ’ d come with him as soon as you ’ d found him
0	how can anyone judge him ?
0	he had not expected the boy ’ s face to have grown so thin and yellow , or his eyes to look so huge and to burn so feverishly , or his hands to seem so brittle
0	kolya slapped his hand on the blanket and perezvon was there beside ilyusha
0	sounds like a lot of nonsense
0	it is also true , though , that this well-tested , thousand-year-old method of spiritual regeneration from slavery to freedom and moral perfection may prove to be a double-edged weapon , for some men , instead of gaining humility and ultimate self-mastery , may acquire the most satanic pride , so that they are fettered rather than free
0	alyosha stood up , ready to leave
0	there was a kitchen in the main house , but he disliked the smell of cooking , so his food had to be carried across the yard all year around , summer and winter
0	such outbursts are not so very unusual
0	but i hardly paid any attention to it
0	what other reason could he have had for coming here ?
0	extending his conquest over nature beyond all bounds through his will and his science , man will constantly experience such great joy that it will replace for him his former anticipation of the pleasures that await him in heaven
0	there were many things that made us hate each other , katya , but i swear to you , i loved you while i hated you , but you did not love me !
0	right you are , the landlord said , that was exactly what they decided to do ; montferrant , who was building st isaac 's cathedral , said : 'break it up and then cart the pieces away
0	and yet , i don ’ t know what to think of her anymore
0	do you forgive me ?
0	mr karamazov either did not see or did not want to see the wickedness , but responded in kind , grinning back
0	nothing , nothing will bring him back now , i know it , he cried sorrowfully
0	did not you see how he was melting from sheer joy
0	but , for certain special reasons , he decided to treat you with indulgence since inquiries were made and it was found that once you had belonged to decent society and had even served in the guards but that later you had been ostracized and that your reputation was , to say the least , dubious
0	possibly he even viewed that first lover ’ as a sort of fictional character
0	he is sick now and bedridden , but nevertheless , he is pretty sure to see that she lacks nothing , whatever happens
0	i could work on it for years , and finally , out of that infernal den , a soul would emerge that was noble for having known suffering
0	yes , i ’ m referring to you , mr miusov
0	that morning , before lapsing into sleep , the elder had told him : i shall not die before enjoying one more talk with you , my dear ones , before once more looking at your dear faces and once more pouring out my soul to you
0	go and find out
0	i decided that he would mistaken lambert for anna 's brother , but , just as if he would thrust his eyes inside my soul , he added : no , sir , it was not lambert , it was her real brother , the young mr versilov—an army ensign , i believe
0	but how could i suspect that it would end up in murder ?
0	perhaps that ’ s exactly what happened between them , alyosha suddenly thought
0	say , don ’ t you think it was very clever , the way they caught up with him in mokroye ?
0	during the summer there was talk of taking him abroad for a cure , but mrs prutkov decided there was no need for that
0	as to trishatov , i have been out of touch with him since that day , although i am still trying to trace him
0	so it shall be and so be it !
0	i have also mentioned tatyana 's strange weakness for that woman and her reluctance to fire her
0	he did not know why he was hugging the earth , why he could not kiss it enough , why he longed to kiss it all
0	she turned and again vanished behind the heavy curtain , so quickly that alyosha didn ’ t even have time to answer her , although he had things to say to her
0	it is useful morally and , even more so , politically
0	i also marveled at his face
0	he ’ ll die today , alyosha said
0	however , i definitely deny that he was ever really insane , especially since today he may be described as anything but insane
0	they don ’ t just say that , they even have it in writing , at least the jesuits have
0	what did it say ?
0	all right , i will take your bet , he said in a dry and stern tone
0	and you , alyosha , don ’ t you forget to tell mitya that i sent them those pies
0	and that ’ s just what i want : i ’ d like to get there and be punished
0	so you came here to conquer hearts , take elegant society by storm , and avenge yourself on god knows whom for being illegitimate ?
0	grushenka shouted at the top of her voice
0	what amazes me most is not even your intelligence but the mere fact that a man of your integrity , a man so infinitely superior to me , can walk next to me and talk to me with such friendly simplicity as if nothing unpleasant had ever happened
0	you know , we go in more for beating , flogging , whipping—that ’ s more to our national taste
0	by the way , ilyusha , did you know he just got married to that miss mikhailov ?
0	he was too delicate anyway : it would been more than he could take
0	listen to me , you miserable dog !
0	and so , acting jointly with his double , he picked up the icon and smashed it in two !
0	please tell me what you think of him
0	what makes you think it ’ s something that concerns you , though ?
0	she measured me with her eyes as a strange smile played on her lips , apparently she was calculating something
0	i noticed it only later , all of a sudden , but for about a month he ’ d been coming to see me almost every day , although i ’ d known him for quite a long time even before that
0	now let me make a confession to you , karamazov , so that you ’ ll know from the start what kind of a person i am
0	you know , curiously enough , as i was looking at you inside there , while you were telling some story , i suddenly thought you must be overly suspicious and sensitive
0	if you want , i ’ ll come and see you tomorrow , for there are many things for us to talk about , but for now , good-by
0	this does not mean i am trying to compare myself with columbus , and if anyone infers anything of that sort , he should be ashamed of himself
0	sounds stupid , sir
0	tell me , rather , how long will you stay here ?
0	the pretty boy explained that bologne was her lap dog
0	the spectators roar with joy because the child torturer has been acquitted
0	but your heart is better than your head
0	i suppose it shows that a good half of my soul was still occupied by a child
0	isn ’ t that a poem in itself ?
0	fathers and teachers , the elder then said , turning to his visitors with a warm smile , never until this day , not even to him , have i revealed why the face of this youth is so dear to my heart
0	and before the girl , paralyzed with terror , could answer him , he threw himself down at her feet
0	when the general ’ s widow died not long after , she bequeathed a thousand rubles to each boy to be spent exclusively on his education , but sparingly , so that it should last until their coming of age
0	it only cost one ruble , and it was not your ruble
0	well , it won ’ t fall apart in two days , your venice , i promise you !
0	came the voice of the nonentity again
0	there is hardly anything personal in them
0	it is mr perkhotin , isn ’ t it ? —generally speaking , i do not believe in miracles , but this time , with that icon , it ’ s really amazing !
0	oh , my god , my god !
0	and it is not at all that men afflicted with jealousy are necessarily mean and dirty-minded
0	how are things with her now ?
0	and what about the cellar ?
0	they called out to him , die in the lord , because his grace has descended upon you too !
0	i muttered something breathlessly , but i was no longer afraid to look into her face
0	there 's mystery in every tree , in every blade of grass
0	so you will come with us , for i wo not let you out of my sight now
0	well , he ’ s still quite cheerful , but now he ’ s liable suddenly to start pacing the room , shaking his head , and twisting the hairs on his right temple with his finger
0	no , enjoy isn ’ t the right word—i ’ m sort of enthusiastic about it , you understand ?
0	then , in a fit of morbid depression , caused by the combination of his epilepsy and the terrible disaster that had struck his house , smerdyakov hanged himself
0	and that was the last i ever saw of her , for she died three years later , having spent the time in between missing her two sons and being wretched without them
0	smerdyakov , come here , smerdyakov
0	i lay thinking such thoughts , with my face buried in the pillow for i don ’ t know how long
0	i took things for granted then , without questioning
0	she had another fit of hysterics : she fell to the ground , sobbing and screaming
0	and even that ’ s not the whole story
0	perhaps you can tell me , though , how many fingers you have on your hand ?
0	the thought that versilov had not bothered to tell me this struck me as very strange , and i immediately thought : if he did not tell me , he may very well not have told mother either
0	now that 's more than i will take from you , i said and started walking toward the door , but before i had even reached it he called :
0	it was the first time i would kissed her
0	she opened it and pulled out a blank sheet of notepaper
0	but after many violent explosions of sobs and hysterics , she started to talk and then even spoke eagerly as i listened to her with interest
0	i ’ ve always wanted to stay on good terms with a woman after breaking off with her
0	i took a good look around
0	and i want you to note the sentence where he writes : i ’ ll kill him provided ivan leaves
0	in that case , i am moving out this evening
0	that ’ s not the same thing !
0	i will admit , however , that , until today , i have hesitated to think that this was a planned and premeditated murder
0	so why are you all dressed up then ?
0	but if you would rather not , i will open the door for you at once
0	for another woman it would be wrong , but for you it is right
0	and , by the way , was it cutlets and peas that you ordered this morning ?
0	but she is wrong
0	heads that will not cerebrate ,
0	you could kill him that way
0	this gentleman wore a thin topcoat , stained and patched
0	i had been prepared for anything except these words from her , whom i thought i knew so well
0	listen then : we are not with you , we are with him—and that is our secret , our mystery !
0	katerina , although apparently frightened , still managed to behave with composure , her attitude expressing a mixture of scorn and surprise
0	that talented young man , mr rakitin , whom i have already mentioned , characterized that fatal woman in the following few phrases : early disappointment , betrayal , and fall , desertion by the man who seduced her
0	but the lucidity that had flared up in me for a moment dimmed quickly
0	because there certainly must be such wild places there too
0	they have got a gun !
0	but , then , i once knew a young lady of the old , romantic generation who , after several years of secret love for a gentleman whom , please note , she could have peacefully married at any moment she chose , invented insurmountable obstacles for herself and , one stormy night , jumped from a steep , rather cliff-like bank into a fairly deep , rapid river and drowned , all because she fancied herself an ophelia out of shakespeare
0	people in town knew very little of her past history and what they did know was vague and uncertain
0	at the very moment i started seeing grushenka , i stopped being katerina ’ s fiancé and stopped being an honorable man
0	listen , kids , i ’ m in trouble , kolya started in a serious tone
0	then , as he explained afterward , it was as if something had hit me on the head
0	listen , alyosha said , she ’ s coming
0	mother was ashen also , but in her case it was from fear
0	but perhaps , after having listened to 'lucia , he will go and kill bjoring
0	but i didn ’ t dare argue with mr dmitry , who decided for some reason to make me his watchdog , so to speak
0	clever or not , i ’ m a little taken aback by the fuss you ’ re making about poor dear alexei ’ s finger
0	but let me try to describe everything in logical sequence , although there was , of course , not much logic in me at the time
0	mother said , shaking her head appreciatively
0	when the doctor came—an old german called eisenschmidt—markel would ask him : tell me , doctor , will i be one more day in this world ?
0	mitya then turned abruptly , sat astride his chair , and swung his arm : here , that ’ s how i hit him !
0	we didn ’ t get engaged right away , not for three months after her visit
0	from what i gathered from versilov directly when he let himself go once , they used to hide in corners , wait for each other on the stairs , bounce away from each other red-faced when someone went by ; and many a time the tyrannical landowner would tremble at the sight of any lowly servant scrubbing the floors despite all his seignorial rights !
0	i see that sometimes it exasperates you too that a thought refuses to let itself be molded into words
0	by sheer chance , her two maids had slipped unnoticed out of the house , without permission , to attend some birthday party down the street
0	she almost pushed him out of the room
0	her gaiety was contagious and alyosha felt its effect
0	so he wants me to keep a look-out for her until after midnight
0	here i will note parenthetically that much later i learned that bjoring had suggested to katerina that she somehow or other convince her father to go on a trip to europe with her , meanwhile letting the rumor be spread in petersburg society that he had become completely mentally irresponsible , and have him certified as such by doctors abroad
0	fetyukovich seemed slightly taken aback
0	but let me remind you of one thing , mr karamazov : you said yourself a moment ago that we had promised to behave decently while we are here , and i ’ d like you to remember it
0	without saying a word , he stared at me through his pince-nez and started examining me
0	he says that and he knows
0	mitya allowed them to write it down without saying a word
0	many people heard him say so and , also , that one day he would find enough money to carry out his plan
0	i have heard , i tried again , that mr stebelkov 's affairs are not in very good shape these days
0	i see , i see
0	at that moment , he didn ’ t even want to go on living : what ’ s the point ?
0	grushenka had done so to torment him , in one of her wicked moments , but , to her considerable surprise , dmitry had shown very little interest in it
0	i inevitably said something i should not have
0	but i have no wish to be holy
0	and all of a sudden i felt terrible about behaving like that : why , she 's probably the one person in the world i really love and she 's the one i am trying to hurt the most !
0	and what about you ?
0	and i ’ ll be able to bring you as much gunpowder as you want
0	gradually that feeling of despondency led to illness ; his nerves became really shattered ; and , instead of his stay in tsarskoe being profitable to his health , it had weakened him to such a point that he almost had to take to his bed
0	very recently , however , she told me she had made up her mind to enter a convent
0	but please follow me closely in case i get mixed up , for i feel a bit dizzy
0	do not you dare , do not you dare !
0	especially when his dear papa is a drunken and unscrupulous lecher who never knows just how far he can go
0	i had known my documents were not quite in proper order
0	there was a quiver in it and a certain ring that was new to me ; it was as if someone else had spoken
0	now he had witnessed it himself
0	he hurried to town so that he could attend as quickly as possible to everything he had to do there and get back as soon as he could
0	i met agafia , with whom i had remained on friendly terms
0	they were alone in a smallish garden
0	the little monk listened to their conversation in silence
0	i suspect , though , that the truth lies somewhere between that sacred ideal and the outright lie
0	and that 's why i must not stay alone—that 's as obvious as two times two is four , is not it ?
0	i ’ m not good as you said i was , and that ’ s the truth
0	i can hear you thinking : he ’ s on a binge again !
0	the boy is bound to ask himself : did he love me when he begot me ?
0	he quickly looked all around him , went up very close to alyosha , who was standing in front of him , and started whispering to him with an air of great mystery , although there was absolutely no danger of anyone ’ s overhearing them
0	why should not i have a sumptuous mansion , receive the best people , and exert my influence ?
0	no , you aren ’ t laughing , you ’ re angry again
0	in that other town , you know
0	how could the accused have managed to leave the bed quite undisturbed , especially since his hands were covered with blood at the time ?
0	hey , stebelkov 's here too !
0	finally the boy let his finger go , jumped back to a safe distance as before , and waited
0	i did not catch what you said , i was in such a hurry to get here on time
0	just listen to him !
0	we understand very well , the prosecutor said drily , that the statement you have just made is the result of your irritation with us , your exasperation at questions that you consider trivial but that happen to be really quite essential
0	i think you ’ ve had enough to drink
0	the examining magistrate was much too grateful to them and did not wish to complicate matters with such trifles , especially since the whole thing seemed to be just an ordinary argument between people who were drunk
0	she pointed to kalganov , who had had quite a bit to drink and had dozed off sitting on the sofa
0	that ’ s a good idea , alyosha said
0	as to the amount of money mitya had on him , kalganov refused to make an estimate : i don ’ t know how much there was
0	all right , that will do , take it !
0	like a wild beast , i took one step in his direction , stopped , and glared challengingly into his face
0	i cried out , striking my head with my hand
0	i suddenly realized that he had known who i was all along and so probably knew many other things as well
0	as you can see , i ’ m all mixed up : i ’ m here secretly in order to protect a secret
0	if god spares me for now and i go on living , i ’ ll wait on you too , for we should all wait on each other
0	and anyway , what do you see in him that you should make all this fuss over him ?
0	too late for what ?
0	may i join you , please , as one passing traveler joins other travelers ?
0	i rather suspected something of the sort , though
0	and that 's when the second branch of the sokolskys came to the fore
0	so you are trying to make me your spy , your paid spy !
0	what was i to do ?
0	they got frightened then and stopped
0	would you give us a figure ?
0	nevertheless , i am very well aware that there are women who can , within one second , sweep you off your feet by their beauty or charm , while with others it may take you as long as six months just to make them out and understand what 's in them ; to decipher a woman like that and fall in love with her , it 's not enough just to look at her and be ready for whatever may come ; no , a man must have a special gift for that
0	upon leaving the doctor , however , ivan wisely ignored his advice and did not put himself in the doctor ’ s hands
0	but mrs prutkov happened to be around , and it was through her that a job was found for me , for old sokolsky had been looking for a young man to work with him in his study
0	right now i will go and spend the night in some inn because i do not want to spend another night under this roof
0	but they would leave with nothing except the presents i might give them , and this would only double their curiosity about me :
0	but step in while i am getting ready i wo not be a minute !
0	that ’ s a smoky topaz , nelyudov said with a smile
0	yes , you must absolutely go and see him right now
0	yes , it was indeed , yesterday 's woman !
0	the good old hell fire was much better
0	well , with all the witnesses , it didn ’ t take the judge very long to decide
0	the ladies protested in whispers
0	i know how she feels about you !
0	could he mean what he was saying or , at least , did he really believe in the possibility of marrying me off ?
0	the picture drawn by rakitin was grim and tragic and it seemed to further strengthen the position of the prosecution
0	or do you know what ?
0	the pretty boy , however , did not seem in the least put off by her disgusted expression while she tried to wave him aside as if she were really afraid to be dirtied by touching him ( it struck me as absurd because he was so neat and pretty and turned out to have an awfully elegant suit on when he threw off his topcoat )
0	i asked this suddenly , like one whose reason has lost control over his actions
0	you see , mr ivan , it ’ s like this
0	don ’ t be squeamish , use the proper words
0	an extremely profound observation , colonel
0	it was very elegant but old ( that is , anna had worn it two or three times ) and they were now trying to alter it
0	kolya called perezvon and the dog jumped down from the bed
0	then , when i had a new jacket made here in petersburg , i took it out of the old one and sewed it into the new jacket
0	that was all he said
0	i am too lazy and i find it unpleasant
0	as to his own child , he was only happy during the time his wife was pregnant , for when his son was born , gregory was filled with grief and despair : the boy had six fingers
0	to start with , who do you think you are referring to as haversilov ' in front of your mother ?
0	when i entered the house , i was usually silent and unsmiling , i avoided looking at anyone and sometimes would not even say hello
0	for if i ran away , it would be my ordeal that i ’ d be escaping !
0	but then there is much love in men , almost christ-like love , i know that myself , ivan
0	ah , when i think how close i was to death as i stood there within his reach , putting it around his outstretched neck !
0	and so does mother
0	that ’ s what he wrote me himself
0	i will take off ten rubles
0	i hate his adam ’ s apple , his nose , his eyes , his shameless sneer
0	they taught him nothing
0	on the day the boy was to be christened , gregory was struck by an idea
0	my suggestion that you come was just as preposterous as my letter
0	that , i think , is true and you can write it down
0	two monks from the hermitage were already waiting , the father librarian and father paisii , a sickly man who , although he was not very advanced in years , had a reputation as a great scholar
0	i saw them peep out of the window surreptitiously two or three times , after which they pulled down the curtains
0	indeed , whenever she happened to talk about her little baby to someone or other , she did so in a whisper , even though gregory was out of earshot
0	he was to remember for the rest of his life that his restlessness that night became so overwhelmingly painful that it impelled him to act against his own better judgment
0	why are you so late in coming , alyosha ?
0	but , instead , i am immensely strong
0	even then , he was definitely not in full possession of his mental faculties , for he admitted to me that he had hallucinations while walking about , that he met various persons who were dead in the street , and that satan came to visit him every evening
0	whip them up , andrei
0	and it would have been less humiliating for you
0	but it is not the sum of money itself that matters here—it is the fact that this sum was being used with disgusting cynicism to shatter his dream !
0	the children were discussing something very animatedly , as though they were taking counsel together
0	his reason for staying was to perform the autopsy on the victim , which had been arranged for the following morning
0	he wouldn ’ t accept presents from me
0	a strange and crazy notion !
0	that ’ s the way it feels to me
0	the man looked worried and concerned , and mitya thought he was looking for him
0	finally mrs khokhlakov decided to see him
0	there were a few merchants , some jews eying gold items , and a few members of the well-dressed class
0	pretty badly , for he was quite exasperated at the time
0	i have not yet deserved that much trust on her part
0	i mean , i must entrust you with a little secret : you remember that girl called olympia whom you met here ?
0	and this went on until he broke completely under the strain of work , until he was beyond repair and died in a hospital
0	you are offending me , semyon
0	it simply struck me that it would make such an effective scene , my telling him that
0	a bunch of frauds !
0	i tried to teach her to walk by standing her up in a corner , taking two or three steps away , and then calling her
0	isn ’ t it a fact , though , that there is a certain vague feeling among the people of your town , a certain dissatisfaction with the results of the investigation , some sort of expectation of further developments and discoveries ?
0	my mother is waiting for me for lunch , he said very quickly
0	as soon as she had returned from abroad , katerina had searched for the letter all over petersburg , including at andronikov 's , and was still searching for it , in the vague hope that it might not be in versilov 's hands ; she had even gone to moscow to look for the letter and begged maria to check whether it was not among the papers she had in her house
0	i thought i ’ d look at her scornfully as she stood there in front of me and say in that special tone that shop-assistants use when they ’ re being insolent : you mean you ’ d really expect me to give you four thousand rubles for that ?
0	he doesn ’ t believe in the hymn
0	there 's nothing reprehensible in that , nothing at all
0	they roared with laughter at that , every single one of them
0	tell me , she stopped me as i was reaching the door , did you see with your own eyes that letter being torn up ?
0	what an awful bore that old man is , mr miusov said as maximov trotted off , back toward the monastery
0	go , i said to him , tell people what you did
0	by that time , kolya was already far away , walking jauntily along with an air of triumph
0	and when mankind ’ s faith is shaken , the monks will hold up the image before the wavering world
0	but mother , how could mother go on living with him the way things were ?
0	more and more often she glanced into ilyusha ’ s corner and seemed to be thinking hard about something
0	the sun lavished its light and warmth on them , watching lovingly over its beautiful children
0	i will come to that later , but i want to note here that it was this peculiarity in his attitude toward versilov that predisposed me in his favor
0	why did they have to bring the old prince to this miserable tenement house where he might be even more depressed by the surrounding shabbiness and poverty ?
0	now there was a letter , a handwritten document , irrefutable evidence of the perfidy of her fiance 's daughter and the conspiracy of all those who were trying to keep them apart
0	it 's just as you said yourself—he 's a very proud man and many such proud men , especially those who despise people , like to believe in god
0	i am going to clear it up
0	i , on the other hand , had something against you after i found out how badly you wanted your father ’ s death
0	and you must be firm and stick to what you have decided is right ; do not give up out of weakness ; be steady in your effort and do not throw yourself first this way and then that way
0	and how soon could i get another buyer , for i need the money badly , right away !
0	i could not possibly explain it
0	for if he sees light in the windows , he ’ ll want to come in
0	besides , ivan knew how fond alyosha was of their older brother
0	and anna thinks so too
0	stalking tirelessly a boar
0	didn ’ t i tell you not to come here again !
0	he wore a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat with a silver watch sticking out of the pocket
0	then i went to the corner , took the money from behind the icons , and threw the empty packet on the floor and the pink ribbon next to it
0	i got up from my chair too
0	i sprawled myself out on the sofa because that was my style at the time , the manner i affected
0	you did downstairs and you pointed your finger at me in front of your mother
0	i was bored and thought of picking up a book , but i did not : the idea that it would be looking for a way to kill time made me feel twice as uncomfortable
0	ah , how i love this boy !
0	just look at him : in the middle of the night with a loose woman , covered with his father ’ s blood
0	and they carry gretchen off , and just at that moment the curtain must fall
0	it was a real privilege to make her acquaintance
0	that day , i swept aside everything that could hold me back , and i want you to know that i would decided to break off definitely with your mother and told her so
0	he goes to the public baths
0	he used them to buy chocolate and cakes in the pastry shop next door for himself and the other boys without even bothering to offer me any
0	but mitya was troubled , deeply troubled , and many claws lacerated his heart
0	now , as for me , i ’ m prepared to give in to you not only on that most important point but on every point and in everything , and i swear right now that that ’ s the way it will be as long as i live !
0	nashchokin waited until darzan had finished and then said to sergei , she does not go out much these days
0	his eunuch-like face seemed to have shrunk , the hair at his temples , brushed back so carefully before , was now tousled , and the wave that had formerly been plastered down on his forehead was now reduced to a thin tuft of hair sticking up on the top of his head
0	and tomorrow i ’ ll beg those hands of the living god ’ to let me go
0	besides , grushenka—i ’ m sorry , i mean miss svetlov—may have told you about it
0	it ’ s not the coat
0	i hope the reader will understand this
0	no , i went on serving her
0	and , then , where were they going to take all those pieces ?
0	there was , therefore , no way that grushenka could have come in or got out
0	timofei told me today that there were lots of people there , sir
0	and what if
0	old zosima is certainly the most honest among the monks , he said , after listening to alyosha ’ s request in thoughtful silence
0	she suddenly cried , rushing toward him
0	but what would i prove by that ?
0	you , too , trifon , forgive me !
0	then he managed to get a rough idea of the connections between the persons involved ( the old prince , her , bjoring , anna , and versilov )
0	in fact , i had full intentions of doing so when i suddenly remembered that i would let him go until the next day
0	that 's quite a thought , versilov said , and he was not laughing at all
0	once she and i were sitting on our terrace under the old lime trees , reading that novel , and the sun was setting too
0	mrs khokhlakov cut him short with a modesty worthy of her generosity
0	mother would ask him sometimes
0	what is it all about finally ?
0	not for a moment !
0	and as they again pass house after house , the condemned man keeps thinking that there are still very , very many houses ahead
0	so why shouldn ’ t i call it a swindle ?
0	and you , afanasy , i have prayed for you every day ever since that time
0	thank you , my dear boy
0	your money or your life ’
0	you are mistaken about your own feelings , he concluded , but once you understand where you went wrong , everything can be corrected
0	he owned a couple of good dueling pistols and their cartridges , which he had not yet pawned because he happened to prize them above all his other belongings
0	i have mentioned this to you before
0	well , i for one know nothing about it yet
0	mitya asked him dreamily , pointing at one of the large rings on nelyudov ’ s right hand
0	since the three thousand rubles has been mentioned now , i will allow myself to anticipate a little at this point
0	you know , i surprised anna a great deal today when i told her the latest bit of gossip about the possibility of katerina akhmakov marrying baron bjoring
0	i met him on the boulevard , and this former university student ( as he turned out to be ) taught me a new peculiar game
0	but why , the prosecution cries , didn ’ t smerdyakov confess his guilt in his suicide note ?
0	one day the girl came to her father and declared that she wanted to marry versilov
0	you ’ ll get yourself into a real mess over there
0	i am so glad you took this street because otherwise i would not have found you today !
0	either because the little white rose fascinated her or because she wanted the flower as a keepsake , since it had been in her boy ’ s hands , she became very excited and stretched out her hands toward the flower
0	and what do you say about the trial ?
0	but he was so carried away by his false misery that for a second he almost believed himself and was so moved that he actually did shed a few sentimental tears
0	you kept looking at me all the time
0	but then , in the silence of the night , she suddenly heard distant groans coming from the direction of the garden
0	in that basket was a hedgehog
0	you see , then , you yourself sowed the seeds of destruction for your own kingdom , and no one else is to blame
0	well , i ’ ve talked enough , he said , his smile more twisted than ever
0	i came here intending to forgive him if he would just offer me his hand ; i was prepared to ask his forgiveness and to forgive him
0	but lisa—are not you at least sorry about her ?
0	god lies not in strength but in truth
0	of course , he may have implanted a small worm of doubt in the jury and the public as to the value of the testimony of a man who was in a state in which he could have seen even the gates of heaven wide open , and who , moreover , still did not know what year it was
0	come , come , my dear boy , you are rather overdoing it , are not you ?
0	nonsense , i bet you are imagining things
0	and suddenly a thought flashed through my head and i almost shouted :
0	i also want to emphasize the fact that the gun belonged to lambert while versilov himself came unarmed
0	i see—this is something you didn ’ t know then
0	why , is prince sergei a friend of yours then ?
0	i ’ ll have to stay here for some time , though , with my two brothers
0	you see , i can even speak polish !
0	is it that if i leave , that ’ s what will happen here ?
0	you were so sweet , i ’ d like to give you a big hug for it now !
0	i owe them nothing
0	but i must point out one thing : if god does exist and if he really created the world , then , as we well know
0	and when i woke up , my eyes were actually wet with tears
0	oh , he had not thought of anything else throughout the past few days !
0	will you believe me if i tell you that , after i left you this morning , after that scene there , i was thinking to myself that , after all , i ’ m just a callow twenty-three-year-old , and you , you saw it right away and it ’ s from that that you start
0	then he lived for a long time somewhere in southern russia
0	it ’ s because i ’ m too eager to live
0	don ’ t worry—i didn ’ t steal it from him
0	i got up too and together we pushed him out of the room
0	but what would alyosha do without him ?
0	yes , he thought , what she said may be the real truth
0	i repeat again : i yield to no one the right to defend the accused , for i am both accuser and defender !
0	he raved even as he walked through the streets
0	she even seemed to enjoy providing him with all the minute details , but not because she savored his pain
0	he had risen when he saw his brother and his voice sounded warm and friendly ; indeed , its warmth rather surprised alyosha
0	was it lambert who told you that ?
0	because i am good , am i not , very , very good ?
0	why , i certainly haven ’ t borne it all so that my crimes and my sufferings would be used as manure to nurture the harmony that will appear in some remote future to be enjoyed by some unknown creatures
0	i was all my mother had left then , but soon some good friends persuaded her that , since i was now her only son and she was not really poor , she ought to follow the example of so many other parents and send me to petersburg , so as not to deprive me of a brilliant career
0	she got up and the next thing i knew she was gone , she would vanished behind the heavy curtain
0	what can there have been between them to make him write her such letters ?
0	for some reason they all expect that i will suddenly up and marry
0	he had been struck by katerina ’ s domineering ways and by her casual , easy , self-assured manner
0	i knew that there were things that were bothering him , but what is awful is that i imagined only about a tenth of what was really weighing on him and never even suspected the existence of the remaining nine-tenths
0	and , believe me , it didn ’ t take us long to manage it
0	to make things worse , the landlord once again started holding forth about spiritualism and described some unexplainable trick that he would witnessed himself at a seance when a touring medium had chopped off people 's heads so that the blood gushed out in front of the audience ; then the medium had pressed the heads back onto the necks until they became grafted again and everyone present had seen that too
0	samsonov had sent for this giant not because he was really afraid of dmitry—he was not one to be easily frightened—but because he thought it would be better to have a witness and , well , just in case
0	it had lambert 's address on it , written very neatly and legibly
0	get him , get him , help !
0	alphonsine urged us shrilly
0	oh , by that time i had become quite permeated by hatred , unmitigated hatred for everybody and everything , and although i still followed touchard , clothesbrush in hand , now i hated him , hated him more and more with every passing day
0	he recovered from the terrible blow which , according to his deposition , you inflicted on him , a fact that has now been confirmed by your own statement
0	ah , do not worry , i am sure it 's all nonsense
0	he came at once and waited in silence for , like all the rest of them , he lived in awe of his father
0	if i were in her place , i would not oppose it either , out of sheer pride !
0	so why should not she want to marry you ?
0	the candles had been snuffed out a while before
0	it ’ s all lies , lies on top of more lies
0	we are going to take him home and tame him , she said
0	i invited you and you accepted my invitation
0	so give me your sweet little hand , miss katerina , my angel , grushenka said in a tender voice , in a tone of great reverence , taking katerina ’ s hand in hers , and i will kiss it just as you kissed mine , dear miss
0	where else would he be , if not with the lord ?
0	so what happened then ?
0	but i still had not recovered from the shock so i just took the money and walked toward the door
0	grushenka cried , imperiously stamping her foot on the floor
0	in short , i told him that he was the only person in petersburg i could ask to act as my second in an urgent matter of honor and that , having known each other since school , he could not refuse to carry my challenge to a duel to lieutenant of the guards prince sergei sokol-sky , who , just over a year ago in ems , had slapped my father , ver-silov
0	and her salvation will come from the common people , from their faith and their humility
0	he left behind a manuscript full of intricate theories , in which he uses phrenology , craniology , and even mathematics to prove that the russians are a second-rate people and therefore , being a russian himself , he does not consider it worthwhile remaining alive
0	i have told you everything , arkady , she went straight to the point ; so you understand that whatever happens to me now depends entirely on you
0	c'est un ange , un ange du del !
0	ivan went to see mitya twice—the first time just after he arrived from moscow
0	i could send anyone , but i wanted an angel as my messenger
0	it is , you understand , a matter of conscience , of the deepest moral concern , and that makes the secret too important for me to cope with alone , so i put off deciding until i ’ d talked it over with you
0	except for one thing , it ’ s true : the day after her visit , her maid appeared stealthily and , without explanation , handed me an envelope addressed to me
0	by the way , everybody in town knew that , within two or three days of his arrival in town , the famous moscow doctor had indulged in some extremely disparaging remarks about dr herzenstube ’ s professional competence
0	last summer , in july , many of us pilgrims , we were hurrying to the monastery of our lady for the holy day
0	i ’ ve noticed it all along
0	mitya gazed blankly toward the window
0	at first i thought he was embarrassed for that long-legged friend of his
0	i can ’ t act as i ought to toward her and tell her now that we ’ re through , ivan said irritably
0	so this is my poem !
0	but it 's too complex a subject for a superficial conversation like ours
0	and he ’ s still here
0	but i did not , feeling it was not dignified with this woman
0	i noticed you a long time ago , alyosha , and mitya knows about it ; i told him
0	he begged father paisii to forgive his presumption
0	despite that , i grew very fond of him and confided all my thoughts and feelings to him , for even without knowing his secret i knew that he was a righteous man
0	you know he is not happy , do not you ?
0	and these sensations would be dear to him and he would treasure them without realizing it himself , indeed , without knowing why or what he would ever do with them
0	as far as i am concerned , i wish all the best to that good and talented young man
0	but perhaps i was wrong and , of course , i did not express any opinion
0	by keeping the reader in ignorance , i clumsily fell for the novelistic device that i tried to ridicule at the outset
0	i ’ ve asked her to do an errand for me
0	he told me that anna thinks that too
0	a great saint , he was !
0	whether because of sickness or because of the eccentric streak in her character , lidia akhmakov did at times behave very unpredictably
0	but he had also detected in those eyes and in the line of her lips something that explained not only why dmitry had fallen madly in love with her but also what made it impossible for him to remain in love with her for long
0	thank you , grushenka , you ’ ve restored my faith in myself , mitya said in a quivering voice
0	that only shows how young you still are
0	why don ’ t you keep quiet , you idiot !
0	trifon plastunov was a solidly built man of medium height , with a rather fleshy face and an expression that was stern and forbidding , especially when he was dealing with the local villagers , but he had the gift of making himself most ingratiating when he felt there was some advantage to be derived from it
0	what do you mean , i ’ m lying ?
0	i know i didn ’ t do it
0	all these reflections flooded my head
0	however , my poem is good
0	there were flowers from katerina too , and when alyosha went in , snegirev had a bunch of flowers in his shaking hands and was scattering them over his dear boy
0	who could blame me for looking around eagerly and trying to find at least one true friend ?
0	besides , these hopes had been building up within him during the whole year of his life in the monastery and had become a habit with him
0	she had obviously guessed why i was praising him
0	oh , i felt so horribly insulted
0	he made no attempt at eloquence , at emotional modulations , at pathos , or at dramatic phrasemaking
0	i admit that i felt quite antagonistic toward sergei when i arrived , and i felt very ashamed of having allowed myself to burst into tears in his presence the day before
0	but it is not so
0	it ’ s that bad then , is it ?
0	his eyes glowed then
0	the man ’ s long , light-brown beard was covered with hoar-frost
0	but let me tell you first , alexei , why i wanted to see you so badly
0	meanwhile i kept on renting the same small room , although i did not really live there
0	he would been to kraft 's apartment in the morning
0	this was perhaps a unique case in fyodor karamazov ’ s life , for he was as sensual as a man can be , one who throughout his life was always prepared , at the slightest encouragement , to chase any skirt
0	i repeat , i have no intention of reporting the entire questioning of the witnesses , step by step
0	he tucked up his cassock and , as he leaped with the agility of a street urchin , his brother ’ s powerful paw caught him by the elbow and helped him over the fence
0	god knows , she said
0	the crowd waiting for him outside stirred hesitantly
0	the presiding judge opened the session by asking the bailiff whether all the jurors had reported
0	ah , lisa , do you really consider that you are absolutely blameless in all this , that you have nothing to reproach yourself for ?
0	she was referring to the desperate step anna had decided to take , the boldest move she would made in her present desperate position
0	i left with the intention of settling in europe and never returning to russia
0	come and visit me there in the evening with krasotkin
0	i wanted to say something to him but could not , so i said nothing and just rushed out of the room
0	i said the young gentleman
0	it sounded like the explanations of a man coming home drunk and , with tremendous excitement , telling his wife or other members of his family that he has just this minute been insulted by some scoundrel while he himself has behaved very nobly , that he will teach the scoundrel a lesson yet—he goes on and on about it , rambling incoherently , banging on the table , shedding drunken tears
0	it ’ s frightening what you tell me , blessed and reverend father
0	well , i really don ’ t know
0	i suppose he has
0	said a fat , pockmarked local landowner , joining one of the groups discussing the trial
0	alyosha tried to protest that he didn ’ t want any liqueur
0	but at the same time he was gripped by terror : how could he make himself do it ?
0	and once again he squandered the money there that he had stolen from his father after he killed him
0	i forgot to mention that he had a great love and respect for his name dolgoruky
0	this is beginning to sound like one of those conversations back at school , lambert
0	mitya followed her as though moving in a drunken haze
0	he 's a german who does not usually go around wagging his tongue and , i remember very well , he 's extremely honest
0	mr skotoboinikov , sir , take pity on these orphans , do not deprive them of their last crust of bread and do not drive them from their nest !
0	i want to destroy myself
0	no , not really differently , but i ’ m sorry i hated him the way i did
0	we have heard all that before , you will tell me ; every german paterfamilias drums it into his children , which does not change the fact that there has still been only one rothschild ( that is , the james rothschild of paris ) while there have been millions of german papas
0	smerdyakov pulled back his right foot until it was level with the left one and drew himself up
0	i do not know myself
0	run and save old karamazov !
0	sit down , ivan , please , here on the sofa , alyosha said , frightened
0	yes , of course , you gave me your word of honor
0	the way we play in warsaw , anyone can come and stake against the bank
0	he just says that
0	besides , he said , kraft seemed to have jotted down at random thoughts that came to his mind
0	and so mother went on trying to pull the bench out of the sun with him on it
0	and she was so nice , invited me to dinner , thought she ’ d disarm me with her chocolate
0	i remember everything , alyosha
0	i ’ ll give it to you and you ’ ll pay her back
0	he was completely exhausted and was determined to go to sleep right away
0	the police released the results of their investigation , saying only that one v , a family man of around fifty , had suddenly declared his passionate love to a highly respectable lady , who did not happen to reciprocate his feelings
0	doesn ’ t it strike you as peculiar , though , when you stop to think of it ?
0	only one person wound up the winner
0	but how am i to describe the feeling of deep sadness that weighed me down then and that i still remember so well and , above all , the fervid excitement which reached such a delirious pitch that i was kept awake at night tormented by my impatience to solve the riddles i had set myself ?
0	i did not have to decide right away
0	i ’ m frightened myself , ma ’ am
0	where did he get that pater seraphicus from ?
0	she was still crying
0	besides them , a young man of about twenty-two wearing ordinary clothes stood waiting in a corner ( where he remained standing all the time )
0	the prosecutor and the defense counsel questioned katerina , mostly in an attempt to find out why she had concealed such an important piece of evidence until then and why her attitude toward the accused had been so different during her previous testimony
0	they work for one another and each of them gives up all he has , and this giving is happiness in itself
0	why are you gaping at me like that ?
0	why , officially we are not even brother and sister but nameless bastards assumed to be the children of a serf , and who has ever heard of princes marrying even the legitimate offspring of serfs ?
0	and that was happening right now
0	on the previous evening , i would received by mail quite a puzzling note from him
0	well , that child is here , in the next room , and i have been wanting to show it to you for a long time
0	grushenka was the first to see him
0	katerina , who would arrived just after them , was sitting on the sofa and lambert was standing in front of her and shouting as only a fool would
0	perkhotin had just finished a glass of tea , had put on his coat , and was about to leave for the capital city inn for a game of billiards
0	he is guilty , they thought , but he will be acquitted out of humane considerations , under the impact of the new ideas and the new feelings about these matters , etc , etc
0	i ’ ll tell you the whole truth , because i want you to know what a horrible creature i am
0	how can you say that ?
0	kolya said , looking very intensely at alyosha
0	and in that dream it was as though i myself had known all these feelings of mankind as i looked at the cliffs , the sea , and the slanting rays of the setting sun
0	do you really believe that the combined wisdom of the earth could produce anything comparable in strength and depth to those three questions that the wise and powerful spirit asked you that day in the desert ?
0	ivan asked with a grin of hatred
0	what damned nonsense and wild lies !
0	if you had not asked me to sell you that album , i would have sold it for forty kopeks
0	by the way , what was the matter with them today ?
0	quite unexpectedly he burst into soundless , happy laughter and kept laughing for a long time
0	the living room , the largest room in the house , was furnished with a sort of old-fashioned pretentiousness
0	but i won ’ t stop myself and i ’ ll do that dishonorable , disgraceful thing
0	one day i may tell you more about that meeting , but for the moment i feel i ought to warn you , vasin went on enigmatically , that he appeared to me to be in an abnormal state
0	he was not in the least troubled by the fact that zosima stood before him an isolated phenomenon : it makes no difference , he is a saint , and his heart knows the secret of regeneration for all , the power that will finally establish the rule of truth on earth
0	perhaps it vanished from there the next day and is now again in the possession of the accused
0	she said with a venomous smile , as if weighing what i would told her
0	that would be very pleasant
0	the boy had his overcoat pockets filled with stones ready to throw ; one could see his pockets bulging with them thirty yards away
0	the old man enters the cell alone and , when he is inside , the door closes behind him
0	i did not know that
0	why , i ’ ll get my daughters up for you , sir , and won ’ t charge you anything for it , let alone a sum like the one you mentioned
0	without further thought , mitya went to this man and offered to pawn his pistols to him for ten rubles
0	but , of course , that ca not be exactly the way i felt then ; i could not possibly have analyzed it like that ; it 's only now that i like to think of myself understanding him , now that i have the advantage of hindsight
0	papa , papa , come here , ilyusha muttered in great excitement , but he was too weak to go on
0	cried someone in a group of young civil servants
0	forgive me , madam , are you quite sure you never gave him any money ?
0	seems to be angry at something
0	and now shall i tell you why you really came here ?
0	before you speak of such historical events as the founding of a nation , you should first try to understand what it means , he said in a stern , lecturing tone
0	please wait a moment , the other said in a clear and delicate voice , slightly drawling his words
0	then something quite unexpected happened
0	i shall simply repeat here what i have said before : he chose the course he did only because it struck him at that particular moment as the ideal course for his soul , which longed to escape from darkness into light
0	as to the specific case , the tragedy itself and the individuals involved , from the accused on down—the presiding judge felt quite indifferent and detached about it all , as perhaps , indeed , he should have
0	it was very hot and i kept flinging open my heavy raccoon-lined coat
0	she ’ s really absolutely marvelous in her own way !
0	well , how are you , arkady , how do you feel now after what happened ?
0	this man is just another von sohn
0	you see , i did not really know him , but
0	no , not on purpose !
0	right : she won ’ t , she won ’ t , she won ’ t !
0	you know how it is when the moon is up and the snow glistens
0	it was obvious that his neighbors had avoided seeing anyone , including the landlady , and during the past few days vasin had noticed that they were going through some sort of a crisis , although he had never witnessed such outbursts as i had
0	but then , you need to know how to find it and that takes talent !
0	yes , makar is dead , and mr versilov would like you to come over right away
0	because of his sickness , the elder had hardly left his cell at all of late and he had been unable to see even his regular visitors
0	and what reasons does he give ?
0	and that way we will be rid of the landlord too
0	katerina called suddenly , looking toward the portiere that separated the drawing room from the room next door
0	she , for her part , knew what he had come to see her about now
0	she wants to make a wager with me that in a fortnight she ’ ll be dancing the quadrille
0	damn you—i have been wanting to send you packing for a long time , and now i am happy to do it at last !
0	do not repine , boy , mystery makes it even more beautiful , he added with tender fervor
0	you can take the bottle away , ivan
0	ah , they will value all too highly the advantages to be derived from submitting to us once and for all
0	so i remained all alone
0	tell me , though , where will the prince spend the night ?
0	and that 's how the young prince sergei sokolsky will pay me back what he owes me
0	but smerdyakov had no choice : he ’ d have killed me if i hadn ’ t told him
0	she hinted that she was willing to go along with all his suggestions , leading him to believe that she was promising him what he was asking for , but it was only an implied agreement : she listened to what he had to say but offered him nothing but an approving silence
0	i have taken the liberty of intruding upon you , madam , because of a matter that concerns a mutual acquaintance , mr dmitry karamazov , perkhotin began ; but as soon as he mentioned that name , the lady ’ s face showed violent irritation and she interrupted him in a voice shrill with fury :
0	gradually ivan began to lose consciousness altogether
0	i succeeded in tiptoeing up to her so she did not hear me and then suddenly i threw my arms round her and kissed her
0	i retorted and turned around , presenting my back to him
0	mitya understands exactly how i feel
0	do you plead guilty or not guilty ?
0	why do not you come home with me ?
0	i was so afraid that , in my state of terror , i sort of suspected everybody
0	actually , she was neither my aunt nor anybody else 's , but somehow everyone called her that all her life
0	was it an acknowledgment of her guilt toward me , as i once thought several years later ?
0	she exclaimed at the end of her letter
0	in that letter i delivered to katerina yesterday , he asked her to meet him whatever her answer to his proposal
0	well , yes , i did fall in love with that educated young lady
0	no , just a minute , wait , he said , and went on to tell everything down to the last little grain of dust , acknowledging his guilt with tears of penitence streaming down his cheeks
0	all these people now interrupted their conversation and looked over at us
0	you must be joking , sir , the little pole said to kalganov sternly , looking him up and down
0	he glanced around the deserted summer house and today it struck him as older and more dilapidated than it had yesterday
0	i assure you , nothing will happen to you
0	and we shall indeed take their sins upon ourselves , and they will adore us as their saviors , who will answer to god for the sins they , the weak , commit
0	he said i ’ m a lady without legs , but in fact i have huge legs , like barrels
0	despite the almost palpable inconsistencies in alphonsine 's crazy tale , we accepted it because we had no time to analyze it and because somehow it struck us then as extremely plausible
0	and you know—i have my 'idea '
0	a man can blurt out anything
0	why , you are accepting money from him now
0	she cried , clasping her hands in front of her in her characteristic gesture of alarm
0	i ’ ve never hidden the way i felt about him—the whole town knows it ; i ’ ve said it often enough in the tavern
0	anna came to my room , clasped her hands beseechingly before me , and implored me—not for her sake but for the prince's—not to move out of the apartment , to stay there , and to go and see the prince the moment he woke up because otherwise he would have a nervous fit and might not be able to preserve his sanity even until evening
0	he found himself in a wooden cabin , quite spacious hut terribly crowded with both people and all sorts of household junk
0	i like her so much , especially at certain moments
0	i went to three monasteries and they told me , go there too , nastya , go and pray there too , meaning this monastery , that is
0	oh , so that ’ s why she keeps looking around with her lorgnette !
0	he did not deign to enlighten me
0	and what if i should meet somebody there ?
0	it is true i suddenly had a father , a feeling i had never experienced before
0	but this is precisely what jealous men can not see , although many of them happen to be men of admirable character
0	i ’ ll soon find out for myself whether he is or not , grushenka said , a threatening note creeping into her voice as she removed the handkerchief from her face
0	as a matter of fact , i think you ’ re right , i won ’ t send him to school anymore
0	i ’ ve seen and heard , alyosha mumbled
0	i know there 's a thousand here anyway
0	you accused me just now of disbelief , of seeing and still not believing
0	and that is the gist of my article
0	and that ’ s the way i understood it
0	as we went in the tiny entry , i heard loud voices arguing about something , with one voice shouting :
0	ah , get out of here , you bunch of jesuits !
0	there was terrible confusion among us and , above all , an upsurge of superstition and gossip ( for there is as much gossip in our nether world as there is in yours , in fact a bit more ) and also denunciations , because we , too , have an institution where denunciations of one ’ s neighbors can be handed in
0	what amazing competence and clear thinking in such a young man , especially these days !
0	alyosha was very embarrassed
0	she remained silent for a moment and sighed
0	what great time , sir !
0	grushenka was the first to call for champagne :
0	you know what , papa , i will get rich , become an officer , and rout all enemies
0	if once again i , so to speak , threw myself into your arms , it was only because when i came in you told me the good news with such obvious pleasure and were , as you said , delighted that i got here in time , and all that after the remark i made to you about the word debut
0	why , stebelkov said , prince sergei is really in a very , very bad position , and not just because of me
0	nothing will happen to him
0	he greatly appreciates chivalry and generosity , but i believe that to him it 's only a principle , an abstract ideal
0	oh , everything is so easy for people like that !
0	he pulled his chair up as close to the table as he could and made a quick sign of the cross under the table
0	they ’ re the kind you can kick in the backside and you ’ d still be doing them too great an honor
0	does this cover it ?
0	the fact that i could have had such a dream , the fact that it could have gushed out of my mind formulated as it was , indicated that i was aware of lots of things—not that i actually knew about them , but that i had a presentiment of much of what was afoot that i have explained here
0	indeed , he appeared quite unable to fix his attention on any particular line of thought
0	but i had to have full assurance of your consent because that way i knew you ’ d never kick up a fuss about the missing three thousand if something went wrong and they suspected me , instead of mr dmitry , or even just thought i was his accomplice
0	it was to be discovered after his death that he had made many other donations secretly , shunning publicity
0	i ’ ll be her husband and i ’ ll be worthy of her
0	he had not even grasped the fundamental ideas underlying the agrarian reforms ; he only found out about them gradually as he went along , a little each year , acquiring knowledge willy-nilly , just because he was faced by the hard facts of life—all of which was particularly surprising in view of the fact that he was a landowner himself
0	was i full of bitterness ?
0	he knew it had not been there when he had sunk exhausted onto the trunk
0	if you can accept the responsibility for the crime committed by the man standing before you , whom you are judging in your heart , then take the crime upon yourself and pay for it with your suffering and let the accused walk away without reproach
0	i think it must have been good !
0	i thought she looked strikingly beautiful and that she was not in the least pale , as some ladies claimed later
0	i ’ ve suspected as much for a long time , you know
0	for half a minute neither of them spoke
0	as it is , you have done a great deal , for you have come to know yourself deeply and sincerely
0	all the members of the household came out to see him off—smerdyakov , martha , and gregory—and ivan gave them ten rubles each
0	most likely they will go bankrupt too
0	that ’ s exactly what he did , except for saying , the hell with all the rest
0	besides , when you think of it—how could i possibly be your judge ?
0	what on earth , for instance , could have induced me to go to dergachev 's and start spouting all those inanities when i should have known in advance that i could not possibly explain anything to them so that it would make sense and that the best thing i could do was to keep my mouth shut ?
0	she took out the envelope that i recognized
0	but you did want someone else to do it—that , certainly , was something you wished
0	alas , i still assumed that i had the document in my possession !
0	your mother is just the opposite of the newspapers which proclaim that anything new makes news and is good , versilov said in a lighter and more cheerful tone , trying to joke away the unpleasantness
0	nevertheless , as he was going up the front steps of mrs khokhlakov ’ s house , an icy shiver of fear chilled his spine , for he realized in a flash that this was his last hope , that if he failed now , there would be nothing left for him , unless it is to cut someone ’ s throat and rob him , and all that for a miserable three thousand
0	those young ladies taught me french there , but what i liked best were krylov 's fables
0	do you really think i relish all these squabbles between you two ?
0	and kolya proceeded to make the dog do all the tricks he knew
0	he had not meant to tell me , but he did
0	i have something to tell you that i think will interest you
0	your great prophet had a vision and told us in an allegory that he had seen all those who were in the first resurrection and that there were twelve thousand of them from each tribe
0	something like that
0	i suppose you ’ ve had enough of listening to all this filth
0	kind of spitefully , though
0	for just at that time they had succeeded in getting her fiance under control and whisking him off to tsarskoe where they kept him under supervision while , for good measure , keeping an eye on her too
0	the conversation came to a halt for a moment , but as the elder resumed his seat , he looked around at the others , apparently inviting them to continue their discussion
0	he robbed him of fifteen hundred rubles and then went straight to have his hair curled and , without even bothering to hide the money , practically carrying it around in his hand , just like this one , went off to a brothel
0	well , she must ’ ve thought to herself : there ’ s nothing i can ’ t manage , nothing i can ’ t cope with , and if i try , i ’ ll put my spell on grushenka too , like anyone else
0	who is the man who can say of himself , i am holy ’ ?
0	i have often noticed that even the most dissolute of frenchmen are excessively addicted to their bourgeois routine when it comes to their domestic life , to a sort of daily , dull ritual of life established once and for all
0	ivan cried , still looking at him in amazement
0	a writer may write for thirty years without ever knowing why he spent all those years writing
0	just the opposite , you acted like an angel , yes , like an angel , and if i have to repeat it a thousand times to convince you , i will
0	but god will save russia , for even if the uneducated man of the people is depraved and can not abstain from his foul sins , he knows that his sins are cursed by god and that he is doing wrong when he sins
0	he looked impatient , annoyed as it were , as if something that was about to happen was being unduly delayed
0	i think this is getting rather involved
0	in my opinion at least , he was not even a mystic
0	shell tell you herself and that will make you feel really good
0	she brought it in here earlier and then forgot to pick it up
0	but why did he ask me that ?
0	if i must descend so low , i felt , why not go down to rock bottom ?
0	feed us first , then ask for virtue—that will be the motto on the banners of those who will oppose you , of those who will raze your temple and build in its place a new , terrifying tower of babel
0	but should you , gentlemen of the jury , allow your feelings and opinions to be swayed like this ?
0	she went back to the bed and felt for him with her hands in the dark , until she was convinced that the bed was really empty
0	there was a considerable commotion
0	they say and prophesy that you will come again with your proud , strong chosen ones and that you will be triumphant
0	selfishness displaces the old unifying principle , and the whole system breaks up into a multitude of individuals , each with a full set of civil rights
0	heaven is within reach of every one of us , and now it is within my reach too ; if i chose i could have it tomorrow , real heaven , for all my life
0	i was dressed properly , not at all the way one imagines a secondhand dealer or a jewish speculator
0	god is against me !
0	indeed , you are a saint , even if you admit those calculations of yours because you imagine you are guilty of something or other and want to punish yourself for it
0	without a concrete idea of what he is living for , man would refuse to live , would rather exterminate himself than remain on this earth , even if bread were scattered all around him
0	and since the document has no legal force and the court has already decided in his favor , even the lawyer of the opposition is of that opinion and said as much to me just now
0	he had never yet come up to my attic , but on this occasion i had not been there an hour before i heard him climbing up the steps
0	you will leave here absolutely unharmed
0	alyosha was walking toward cathedral square
0	at the time , though , he paid little attention to him ; it was only later that he remembered it
0	mitya was silent and so was the usually talkative andrei , who seemed afraid to say a word and only kept urging on his rather thin but lively bays
0	instinctively i hoped to find there something that could free me from all this madness , a quiet harbor where i could drop an anchor that would hold me
0	mummy , why is that little boy looking at my hedgehog like that ?
0	why , didn ’ t you know that ?
0	why , that boy , see ?
0	you ’ ll have to invent something more intelligent to tell me or i won ’ t listen to you
0	when karamazov stopped spouting his stream of malicious slander , the father superior bowed his head and once more said solemnly :
0	that was all he had to say
0	i glared at him as he watched me with a sly triumphant air
0	she was sitting in her armchair by the door
0	what i was trying to say was that i was worrying almost constantly about you during all that time
0	that indicates real hunger , the last degree of hardship !
0	so you see what it means to be able to find the unique trait in everybody !
0	when samsonov ’ s name came up , she snapped with arrogant defiance : that ’ s nobody ’ s business !
0	it ’ s no use trying to turn around in circles now !
0	he was lying , i swear !
0	as for me , although i visit her rather often , i can not say that we talk much about intimate subjects ; indeed , we never so much as mention any of the recent happenings
0	i am sincerely fond of you , arkady , and , besides , i feel very guilty toward you for my behavior during these past two months
0	he yelled with a strange delight , a delight that might have seemed spiteful had it not been so sincere and unaffected
0	for a second he waved before alyosha ’ s eyes the two hundred-ruble bills that , throughout their conversation , he had been holding by a corner between thumb and forefinger
0	i ’ ll never , never , never believe it , nastya lisped heatedly
0	he suddenly interrupted himself , growing gloomy again
0	rakitin shouted loudly , turning red
0	when he waved his arms , the heavy chains he wore under his cassock clanked
0	besides , this one is so damned rich , mitya ’ s reasoning went
0	it 's in a university that i belong , as a professor
0	besides , for obvious reasons she felt it awkward to talk about makar with me
0	well , old man , how are you getting along ?
0	and that 's just what you did when you saw me—you began to laugh
0	forgive them , kraft said incongruously
0	and having learned that i was just plain dolgoruky , the questioner would look me up and down with a blank , stupidly apathetic stare , which proved that he had no idea why he had asked me the question in the first place , and then walk away
0	her expression was amiable enough but with a furrow of reservation
0	with his suspiciousness and with the anger piled up inside him during the few days before , i was sure he ’ d use the signals to get inside the house
0	and hardly a second after he had been ushered into mrs khokhlakov ’ s drawing room , she herself came in , almost running , and told him openly that she had been expecting him
0	over him , tomorrow , they ’ ll sing the glorious anthem our helper and our defender
0	i remained sitting there for a long time , as it gradually became dark
0	i mean that bow before your brother dmitry
0	i had two rubles in cush
0	no , it was neither my illegitimacy which caused me to be taunted at touchard 's school , nor my gloomy childhood , nor the desire for revenge , nor the need to record my protest that lay at the bottom of my idea—it came to me just because my character is what it is
0	her face was rather paler than usual , her lips and eyes were burning , and she nervously tapped the wooden arm-rest of the sofa with her foot
0	i see what you mean , karamazov , kolya said with feeling
0	it was right after the judiciary reforms that they found out about temporary insanity , and this is one of the beneficial results of our new judicial system
0	his expression was grim
0	i cried out enthusiastically
0	i know , i know , just the shadows of hooks
0	if you do , you ’ ll see for yourself that nothing will move , that everything will remain where it is , even though you shout all you want , and that should prove that you too , mr gregory , do not have the true faith , which you like to reproach others for lacking
0	alyosha looked at dmitry with great concentration
0	wait , alyosha , i must give you my parental blessing right now
0	the prosecutor asks us : at what moment could smerdyakov have committed the crime ?
0	as i mentioned before , the most attractive thing about him was his complete lack of affectation , his total disregard for the impression he might make : one could guess he had an almost sinless heart
0	besides us , there were people eating at the four other tables , all of them respectable-looking gentlemen , army officers , and the like , since it was , after all , quite a fashionable restaurant
0	but i have no money
0	mitya jumped up and dashed out of the room to give the necessary instructions
0	ah , the damned rabble !
0	but how could you know that in advance ?
0	as i said , i am convinced he wanted nothing , he was not even thinking : he just felt he had to be there , perhaps to leap out of hiding , say something to her , maybe insult her , and perhaps
0	after her father died , the pious people of the church became even more sentimental about her , since she was now officially an orphan
0	and , provided the writer had great talent , such a book would belong less to russian literature than to russian history
0	it ’ s enough to make anyone sick
0	what happened after that ?
0	i have known the gentleman for three months , lisa added
0	i promise i wo not eat it !
0	the mother sat in a chair next to her daughter ’ s wheelchair and near her stood an old monk
0	he again spoke of mitya
0	ah , mais c ’ est bête enfin !
0	it so happened that , at that very moment , versilov was there , and it took him less than one second to devise the whole diabolical scheme
0	anna asked in surprise
0	why didn ’ t you stop me , ivan , why didn ’ t you tell me i was talking nonsense ?
0	i wanted so badly to trample on them because they are so beautiful
0	the man kept looking in bewilderment from one woman to another
0	she asserted that they both could be true at once , that this was something called la haine dans i'amour , a mutual case of wounded love pride , etc , etc—some oversubtle romantic nonsense unworthy of any sane and responsible person , spiked , moreover , with a goodly amount of villainy
0	she called him papa or father , which was something i absolutely refused to do
0	in the miracle of god ’ s providence
0	versilov sank back into his chair and started talking again
0	so i guess they ’ re afraid of the environment
0	i had come now bearing all this in mind and only wanted to be sure that i would have a second when i needed him , for i did not know anyone else in petersburg
0	eventually they devised a new refinement
0	he was a steadfast , resolute man , who would stubbornly and unwaveringly follow a course once , for some reason ( often extremely illogical ) , he had decided it was incontrovertibly right
0	when sergei came up with the idea , versilov listened to the offer without turning it down , but after that he never reminded sergei of it , indeed , never indicated that he had not forgotten all about it
0	the gang specialized mostly in family secrets
0	much later , lisa told me herself that around that time her liking for vasin diminished and that his calm detachment , which had impressed her so much at first , now struck her as rather unpleasant
0	please continue , and i signed it , a mother
0	but then it 's precisely for such lucky breaks that i am on the lookout ; that 's why i have decided to live in the streets
0	and that ’ s just what your brother ivan is waiting for
0	on top of that , ivan is trying to take his brother mitya ’ s fiancée away from him , and he seems to be succeeding
0	you know , my boy , he said , it 's impossible to love men such as they are
0	no , i don ’ t feel like telling you today
0	so let it be a good lesson to her !
0	ivan wanted to rush to the window but it was as if his legs and arms had suddenly been fettered
0	yes , perkhotin , my dear fellow , that ’ s all nonsense
0	money confers despotic power upon a man , but at the same time it is the greatest equalizer and that 's where its main force lies : money eradicates all inequalities
0	you see , maria , what a long-legged fool you have picked !
0	i must mention , by the way , that although academically alyosha was always among the top students , he was never actually the first in his class
0	in the old days , when we were with the army , we had many guests coming to visit us
0	and , as was to be expected , the playful report ended with an indignant moral indictment both of parricide in general and of the institution of serfdom , which had recently been abolished
0	i walk out of the room , wallowing in tremendous pride
0	to you , my sweet son , because you love me
0	the judge also warned him never to play such tricks again
0	indeed , he made me repeat twice about stebelkov questioning me about the gathering at dergachev 's
0	they plan to prove that dmitry is insane and that he didn ’ t know what he was doing when he killed , alyosha said with a pale smile , but mitya won ’ t accept that
0	versilov had a son and a daughter by her
0	she looked at me intently
0	the prosecutor reached the finale of his peroration here
0	enough of this , please
0	her eyes flashed and she suddenly raised her voice
0	true happiness radiates from his face
0	her body was strong and full and , when she moved , her movements were so light that they seemed inaudible
0	do you think that ’ s likely , mr ivan ?
0	i remember how zverev had devised a bed for me , also on the sofa
0	the roll hit him on the waistcoat and fell to the floor
0	excuse me for saying so , but it 's awfully difficult to follow you
0	dmitry had no doubts about the business side of the deal he was going to offer samsonov ; he was only worried about how samsonov would regard the deal from a non-commercial point of view
0	well , i ordered his pheasant for him , but he will pay for it—i will see to that !
0	lambert stupidly did not introduce us although we were to dine at the same table , so the pockmarked one could easily have taken me for one of lambert 's assistant blackmailers
0	let the irresponsible fool sow his wild oats once more , for the last time
0	i was in a terrible hurry and had difficulty in controlling my breathing
0	his face was beaming
0	later , when grushenka started visiting mitya in prison ( which she did as soon as she could go out , even before she had completely recovered ) , she would sit down upon her return with maximushka and talk all kinds of nonsense to him , just to try and take her mind off her grief ; and she became quite accustomed to him
0	ivan said through his teeth
0	i remember everything , up to the very last second
0	at the trial , his lawyer had just about succeeded in having the case dismissed for lack of evidence when the accused suddenly interrupted him
0	i stared at her in astonishment and disgust
0	when i asked him what position i should take on religious matters , he would answer in the , silliest way , as one would answer a small child :
0	only that he was concerned about me , worried about the practical aspects of my future
0	after that , young smerdyakov crept into his corner and sat glowering from it for a whole week
0	no , you ’ re the one who contracted for that job , and you bungled it
0	before ivan had gone half way to smerdyakov ’ s house , the dry , nipping wind that had been blowing since morning became stronger and a fine , powdery snow started coming down heavily
0	i liked his remark
0	how stupid i was to have tormented myself for five years the way i have
0	my fondest wish is to be able to incarnate myself once and for all into some two-hundred-pound merchant ’ s wife and to believe seriously in all those things that she believes in
0	i arrived home in a highly excited and—i do not know why—exuberantly gay , albeit very confused , state
0	and , by that time , i am ashamed to admit , we had nothing at all to buy food with
0	good evening , i see you are all here , even including you , he said , turning to me
0	that unpleasantness struck me the very first second i saw him and the impression always remained with me
0	yes , dear boy , and it 's my legs that give me most trouble
0	even in town , people talked of his death for a long time
0	i worry more that i might steal from them !
0	no , i don ’ t grasp it , alyosha said , looking at mitya with great curiosity
0	in the passage he took off his soft , wide-brimmed felt hat , the kind he always wore , and a shock of thick hair streaked with silver sprang up
0	you did bring her here !
0	well , forgive me if i ’ ve done the wrong thing
0	i wish to god he were dead !
0	ivan , i bet he picked it up from the jesuits somehow
0	oh , it was money he needed now more than anything else !
0	now , consider this : a man sits there , and he ’ s not mad at all , but then suddenly he has this temporary insanity
0	the first witness to be interrogated was the innkeeper , trifon plastunov
0	i won ’ t offer you any brandy since you ’ re fasting , although perhaps
0	that was the situation when i arrived
0	if so , it is
0	in fact , the other day , i had to borrow five hundred rubles from mr miusov myself
0	after that , he will find peace himself , and thank god , for it 's high time he did
0	but in this case it ’ s not just the legs
0	it ’ s quite warm
0	get out of my sight !
0	so where is she ?
0	he said , pointing to a tiny room that gave onto the passage where there was only an unpainted wooden table , a wicker chair , and a sofa covered with a checkered oilcloth just like the one in my attic here
0	so you could marry her right away
0	so mitya spent almost a year in gregory ’ s little house in the servants ’ quarters
0	besides , i must confess that i myself belong to this reprehensible category of people and have suffered from that foible all my life
0	furthermore , i would like to study the question of whether my client killed his father without robbing him
0	but let 's drop the subject for now , we will discuss it some other time
0	she ’ ll be praying for light from above , to know whether she should save her dear mitya or spell his doom
0	you see , it will probably be at the third stop in the convoy of convicts to siberia
0	i wo not try to describe the hubbub that followed
0	but if i see that this move , as ordinary and minor as it is , takes me further from my main goal , i will break off with them , leave everything , and withdraw into my shell
0	the girl , who was by then in love with versilov , accepted enthusiastically as she wanted to see in this gesture something more than mere chivalry , although she admired that too
0	the boy spent whole evenings there throughout the winter , until the exile was summoned back to petersburg , to take an appointment for which he had petitioned and , since he had some protectors , had now received
0	go on , let me hear it , all of it , don ’ t spare me : was she mad , did she have a fit ?
0	and now i must confess to something pretty stupid
0	those spiritual needs he may have had evaporated completely , while his appetite for life expanded
0	on your way , smerdyakov !
0	but i wasn ’ t complaining at all
0	why , you told me yourself that night when you almost froze to death that she was in love with you
0	i knew that , my boy
0	neither mitya nor anyone else knew then that they were being watched
0	that makes sense , the prosecutor said , giving the examining magistrate a significant look ; that ’ s usually the case
0	he stared at me
0	they beat her , kicked her , flogged her , for no reason that they themselves knew of
0	do you remember , on the day when dmitry broke into the house and beat up father , i said that i reserved to myself the right to wish
0	unfortunately i did not know at the time that versilov , the doctor , and tatyana had agreed , three days before , to do their best to distract mother as much as possible from her constant worrying and brooding about makar , who was in a much worse state than i suspected , quite hopeless in fact
0	what gates of heaven ?
0	and , you know , i don ’ t think i ’ ll tell them about your ability to sham epileptic fits
0	you know what , ivan , everything must have been arranged this way by god himself
0	well , don ’ t think too badly of me , rakitin , my boy , for who can tell , i may be going to my death !
0	the doctor , very stupidly , decided to pretend to be offended and turned to makar , as though asking him to pronounce on tatyana 's statement :
0	she apologized profusely about it , very movingly too , he-he !
0	he still did not know exactly what he was going to do , but he did know that he was no longer in full control of himself and that the least provocation could push him to the very limit , to some unspeakable abomination—although he knew he would not do anything for which he could be held legally punishable and that he would never commit a crime
0	and do you know sabaneyev ?
0	i ’ ll only have some if alyosha does
0	in the garden , in that corner over there , and now he ’ s whispering too
0	and you , my dear boy , i suppose you never even suspected anything all this time ?
0	the brass pestle was in mitya ’ s hand and he tossed it away without even noticing what he was doing
0	the best part of it , though , is that you ’ ve come yourself
0	i ’ ve promised to save you and save you i shall
0	he yelled , furiously slapping the boy ’ s face
0	we could never do that
0	you are an incarnation of myself , i mean of one aspect of me only , the personification of my worst and most stupid thoughts and feelings
0	that ’ s what he said ?
0	why , certainly , with the greatest pleasure ; i ’ d consider it a special honor , i said to him , but as i spoke i felt almost frightened , because i was very impressed by this man
0	zverev expected kraft to arrive either that day or the following one and had sent me a note to that effect
0	and , you know , mother is like that too
0	if you praise me , you only make me ashamed of myself
0	but even so , i claim and proclaim , even so he would not have killed deliberately ; he would have swung his brass pestle in loathing and disgust , without realizing that he might kill , without any intention of killing !
0	i may move out
0	i needed the money urgently
0	both of them are in his will as is
0	i ca not bear to hear you talk like that
0	you saw him , you saw him , didn ’ t you ?
0	and i suddenly felt such infinite pity for him that i believe i would willingly have shared his predicament if only it could have made things a bit easier for him
0	but he did not get a chance : out !
0	and that was how i threw him out , alexei !
0	and it ’ s true—why did i go to chermashnya ?
0	it is you who brought it on , she said
0	you did not know before what to tell me about my legal status in society , is that it ?
0	it will be just the way you decide
0	i was the only one who could have told those arsonists that setting fire to the tuileries was wrong
0	then i hear him moving around and moaning
0	what proof do we have that the accused did not tell us the truth ?
0	but he started it all !
0	come along , the more people , the better !
0	now kolbasnikov is furious with all of us , like an incensed donkey
0	soon it became quite evident , however , that grushenka required no sharp eye to watch over her behavior
0	he also took something of personal , sentimental value to him , but we will come to that later
0	i must make a note of it !
0	but when karamazov learned of this new development in smerdyakov , he at once decided that he was destined to be a cook and sent him off to moscow to be trained
0	men speak of hell fire as a physical fire
0	but we are also duty-bound in a case such as this to warn you of the harm you may do yourself by refusing to answer this or that particular question
0	i have seen the marks of this cruelty on the children working in factories
0	i let kraft get a little way ahead as i considered him of secondary interest
0	there was an impatient probing in the way she looked into my eyes
0	he replied from his end of the table , in a tone that was at once surprised and threatening
0	but what made him decide that you should go out into the world now ?
0	imagine , just before all this happened , yesterday morning , she suddenly asked me : 'tell me , are you or are not you in love with katerina akhmakov ?
0	the reason for this is that he has become accustomed to relying only on himself ; he has split off from the whole and become an isolated unit ; he has trained his soul not to rely on human help , not to believe in men and mankind , and only to worry that the wealth and privileges he has accumulated may get lost
0	three days before , i had found the clerk in the downstairs office and had asked him where i should inquire about my salary
0	so there ’ s no reason to be sorry for them
0	the boy looked at him in surprise
0	yes , that was certainly the most important , but since i could not mention it , everything he would confessed to me about his feelings , which i was sure would make mother happy , obviously remained beyond her understanding
0	when they announced that captain karamazov was there to see him , he at once declared he would not receive him
0	i thought i would wait and see whether i should go or not
0	have you come on lisa 's behalf ?
0	i mean , i wonder whether you
0	kolya felt he had to ward off this objection , although he was very pleased with it
0	in a third group :
0	they ’ ll have a funeral repast , i suppose , and the priest is coming back too
0	his name is perezvon
0	she was a very strange girl , vasin said , and it 's quite possible that she was not always in her right mind
0	it was already daylight when i awoke
0	it ’ s all about true things
0	lisa said , pointing at me
0	ah , so you wo not give it to me
0	come on , man , speak up , for heaven 's sake !
0	you know , father superior , you hurt his feelings by mentioning family harmony : he refuses to acknowledge the fact that we ’ re related
0	besides , my dear boy , what is there in man 's world ?
0	tell me , will vasin be there ?
0	yes , and it ’ s true that the other nations won ’ t stand for it
0	stebelkov was on the point of following them but thought better of it , stopped short , raised one finger , and grinned , obviously having thought of something
0	he ’ s not looking for money or for security
0	i would just stayed for a minute and left without even sitting down
0	what sort of contempt could there be when we ’ re all just like him , for we are—we are not his betters
0	alyosha said with a shudder
0	here , these three sensualists are stalking one another now , each one of them with a knife hidden in the leg of his boot
0	now let us talk about that door a little , gentlemen of the jury
0	would you believe it , alyosha , sometimes i look at you and i ’ m ashamed of myself and of everything about me
0	i picked up the candle and saw him off to the landing
0	he had hardly stirred or taken his eyes off him
0	i was just about to get out of bed to install myself in the armchair by the table when daria came in
0	we shall allow them or forbid them to live with their wives or mistresses , to have or not have children—all according to the degree of their obedience to us—and they will submit to us with cheerfulness and joy
0	if you want my advice , lie down and demand that they send for a doctor at once
0	it was brief and to the point ; it listed the main reasons why dmitry karamazov had been arrested and brought to trial , etc
0	these days it may be good to listen to what intelligent people say and try to remember it , anna said , perhaps in my defense
0	why not ascribe to me , instead of laziness und hypocrisy , something less reprehensible , a touch of stupidity perhaps , but high-minded stupidity ?
0	rather , i ’ m trying to make use of you as a way of healing myself
0	an idiot comes and you at once feel obliged to disgrace yourself before him !
0	for monks are no different from other men , and they must be what other men ought to strive to become
0	you ’ re an intelligent person , but
0	but your landlord is expecting you
0	i know that no one could resist you and , although i am a gruff old woman , i could not possibly stand up to you ; in fact , let me kiss you right now
0	he was a widower and childless
0	while i was speaking breathlessly , he took the letter from me and , holding it casually in his left hand , continued to look thoughtfully into my eyes
0	with all that , he was a wealthy man with good connections
0	whom will he be grateful to ?
0	oh , mitya , you feel so terribly miserable
0	the elder lowered himself onto the bed , completely exhausted ; his eyes shone and he breathed with great difficulty
0	wait , you didn ’ t get that from me !
0	for the man of god , father , for alexei the man of god
0	besides , do you think i ’ m not on edge too ?
0	come and have fish soup whenever you like—only let us know in advance when
0	grushenka said aggressively , as if trying to pick a quarrel
0	but what really caused a sensation was mitya ’ s unexpected outburst
0	she won ’ t forgive me at all , mitya said with a bitter grin
0	then , behind the wall , on my left , i noticed a big pile of firewood , a huge one such as might be found in a lumber yard , that rose at least six feet above the stone wall
0	but whether my guess was right or not , i still have no idea
0	although this worthy widower had arrived here only three years before , he had already gained general approval , because he was one of those men who know how to rally the public behind them
0	all i could gather from what she said was that she had some close connections with a certain maison de monsieur andrieux—hautes nouveautés , articles de paris ,
0	you ’ re putting on a whole act for my benefit , damn you !
0	i will also note that in five days it was mother 's birthday , an occasion we were planning to celebrate and had been talking about quite a bit
0	but i never imagined that what i said could cause him to look so terrified
0	as of now , i am all for realism !
0	ah , yes , i want you to serve andrei some vodka
0	is smerdyakov the only one who knows about grushenka and father ?
0	i hated you then and i just managed to convince myself for one second
0	go away , father , and do not confuse the flock
0	i left him with the definite conviction that he was a malicious , morbidly vain , vengeful , and spitefully envious creature
0	finally , aferdov was well known around there , considered a rich man , and treated with respect
0	a death-like silence descends upon the square and in that silence the guards lay hands on him and lead him away
0	then why does he say that you have all the vices ?
0	what did he say to you that pleased you so much ?
0	i do not think it has any pretension to humor , versilov suddenly said
0	i will play you something when i come to see you
0	if i told you where i had got the money , it would be a disgrace that would be even worse for me than killing and robbing my father—if i had done it , i mean
0	besides all these difficulties , the old prince had another peculiar weakness ( i am not sure whether to call it ridiculous or not ) in which he had indulged even in his younger years—finding husbands for penniless girls
0	as far as i could make out , they had become acquainted only recently , as a result of great efforts on sergei 's part
0	corruption is spreading visibly ; every hour it is working its way down the social scale
0	i never even mentioned mother or lisa and , of course , never a word about myself and my past
0	i told her that we wo not be in the way
0	it became only too obvious to me what a blow to his pride anna 's engagement to another man was
0	then i went into the cafe on the canal
0	so if they don ’ t find me out , we ’ ll settle here , somewhere out of the way too , and work the land , and i ’ ll just have to pretend i ’ m an american as long as i live
0	they were talking polish and were discussing the latest developments in paris
0	if she does , let her enter heaven ; if the onion breaks , the old woman will just have to stay where she is
0	so , after all , it was a symbolic gesture : he was absolutely determined to put an end to something and he felt the need to convey it to mother and to the rest of us
0	she was the widow of a government employee
0	it was only at about am , shortly before dawn , that the authorities arrived
0	mother , she said , i remember so clearly now that pine i ’ ve been pining for
0	hey , alyosha , my boy , are you still following me or have you fallen asleep ?
0	i simply wanted to find out whether he was dead or alive
0	did i say that ?
0	i drove him to it by tormenting and baiting him
0	that was in moscow , he explained , turning to his sister
0	i ’ d become very attached to you , mr ivan , and i had complete faith in you
0	i can not even convey how unpleasantly struck i was by anna 's solemn speech
0	who killed him , since i didn ’ t do it ?
0	his behavior was somehow different , too : it wasn ’ t that he ’ d become more dignified , but he was more self-assured , even insolent
0	he asked fenya many questions , very precise questions which one would never have expected from a man in his state
0	yes , he explained , i used to be surrounded by the glory of god—the birds and the trees and the fields and the sky—and i alone lived in degradation
0	this was the same impulsive katya who had hurried to the lodgings of the young rake to save her father ’ s honor , the same young woman who , proud and chaste , had earlier been willing to forget her feminine modesty before the public , in order to tell of mitya ’ s generosity , because it would , she hoped then , help him with the jury
0	and after that , having announced that this courtroom must be a platform for justice , for a sound , rational approach , we hear the counsel for the defense announce under oath that parricide is nothing but an obsolete prejudice
0	and so , sir , i was whisked off to touchard 's boarding school , completely innocent and full of adoration for you , and although this was nothing but a silly incident—i mean that fust meeting of ours—would you believe me if i told you that six months later i was planning to run away from touchard 's to you ?
0	is father still asleep or is he up ?
0	i knelt before the icon and prayed
0	certainly , and he has already been hit , not in the head but in the chest , just above the heart
0	you ’ re a son of a bitch !
0	you are young and that 's wonderful
0	my sister touched my arm once more
0	i won ’ t answer any more questions
0	and i believe you believe it and that you ’ re sincere
0	and when i fell asleep , it was you i would dream of
0	well , he came in riding piggyback on top of that one over there
0	the prospect of parting with ivan did not seem to move him in the least ; indeed , he did not have much to say to ivan now
0	listen , gentlemen , there is in our town a poor but honorable man , a former army captain ; he had some bad luck and was forced to resign his commission , but it was done quietly
0	and please do not come out with me now and do not ever come to see me
0	but i also noticed certain unmistakable signs that he was feverish , very feverish as a matter of fact
0	well , there 's no need for that
0	playfully she sat down on the sofa very close to alyosha , looking at him in undisguised delight
0	then i felt myself turning pale
0	why , do i sound drunk to you ?
0	he was galloping at full speed toward mrs morozov ’ s house
0	he is followed by his grisly assistants , his slaves , his holy guard
0	i understood today how true that is because i have been given back my ideal !
0	no , please go on !
0	rakitin wants to write an article about me , about my trial ; he hopes to start on his journalistic career that way
0	she comes of humble folk
0	yes , he added that , and smerdyakov said that too
0	being a man of noble feelings , he must hide his anger at being forced to playact , to wrap himself in a veil of saintliness
0	it was just at this moment that alyosha walked in
0	sensitive as she was , mother had noticed a certain coolness between brother and sister , but if there was something of that sort it was not from lack of affection but rather from jealousy
0	and that ’ s how he gets away with it
0	after that i would only have to worry about versilov and mother
0	nowadays this word is often pronounced with a sort of derision by the educated , and some even use it as a term of abuse
0	in general , although in my imagination i have always managed to handle people pretty well , in real life i have proved rather inept at it
0	you ’ re a very determined man , alexei
0	yesterday a stupid thought came to me , you know , when i asked you to come over today : i wanted to find out something about mitya from you
0	and the moment i made up my mind , i went mad and started talking
0	no , that 's out of question !
0	with eternal mother earth
0	in a strange way , being undressed somehow made him feel guilty before them and , what was even worse , he felt that now he had become their inferior and they had the right to despise him
0	he cheats his own son of his mother ’ s inheritance and uses the money to seduce that son ’ s mistress
0	i have the feeling that if you could have loved me a little less , i would have fallen in love with you
0	i don ’ t suppose you ’ ll eat salami under the circumstances , will you ?
0	i ’ m under the impression that you rather like me , don ’ t you , alyosha ?
0	a home is where people live
0	but what has all that to do with me ?
0	what do you have to offer as proof of the confession you have just made ?
0	you ’ re saying that because i blushed ?
0	he assumed a most dignified air and , with something that might have been a hint of feeling , proposed to her
0	and , besides , as i was stepping into the restaurant , it suddenly struck me how incredibly ignorant lambert was
0	well , will you believe me , mr miusov , if i tell you i was aware of that too and , what ’ s more , as soon as i started to speak , i knew , i somehow felt , that you ’ d be the first to make some remark ?
0	the heretics blasphemously dismissed miracles
0	for karamazov was about to die , about to shoot himself , and he wanted to mark the occasion , so that everybody would remember it
0	an old man , it was !
0	well , i suppose discovering how to turn stones into bread would be a great idea
0	you ’ re a fine one to call me a whore !
0	otherwise , a woman like me wouldn ’ t have anything to do with someone like you
0	what if he goes to mokroye and kills my mistress ?
0	mitya simply beamed with delight
0	as he was leaving the house , alyosha asked the landlady to look after ilyusha ’ s mother and his sister who , of course , had to stay behind
0	my dear friend , bring katerina here , let them kiss right in front of me , and i will take both of them home with me !
0	what would he come up with , i kept asking myself , although i did not dare talk to her about it
0	the boy lay there in a deep faint , hardly breathing
0	and that 's the end of the matter , tatyana
0	your face , or something about it , the expression perhaps , became so deeply engraved in my memory that i immediately recognized you
0	and so stepanov was caught in a trap since , as a matter of honor , he could not very well deny having heard the story
0	you could listen to him and think that he was being absolutely serious when , actually , he would just be putting on an act and laughing at you
0	the old man longs for him to say something , however painful and terrifying
0	for them , hell is voluntary and unending
0	mitya shouted to the landlord
0	besides , once you are married , you will take her well in hand : a woman in love even likes to be treated roughly
0	but i suppose i would better say a few words about that
0	are you trying to impress her again , you silly pup ?
0	rakitin replied , at once flushing all over
0	but the next second she lost control of herself and burst out laughing
0	they just came to an end today
0	he wouldn ’ t have that look on his face if she were there with him
0	it was not really a dining room , since the father superior had only two rooms altogether
0	our carriages drove up to your gate at the same time
0	i almost believe that if juchka was found alive and brought to him and he was convinced that he hadn ’ t killed the dog , the boy would come back to life out of sheer joy
0	the two poles cried , indignantly glaring at mitya like two fighting cocks
0	yes , that 's how the situation must have appeared from the outside !
0	where on earth can she be ?
0	of course , arkasha , of course , my darling , i went to stay with your great aunt barbara three times : the first time you were just one , the second you were almost three , and the third time was just after your sixth birthday
0	he had guests to dinner every evening , if only one or two , for he never dined alone
0	but i will describe that incident later , for what happened during the evening in question was simply a prelude
0	and so , on the sly , i counted off half the three thousand and cold-bloodedly picked up a needle and sewed it up in the rag myself ; it was only after i had it safely tucked away that i went off to squander the other fifteen hundred on that spree
0	versilov sent me another note , in which he apologized for having troubled me , asked me to disregard the challenge , and to forgive him for his 'selfish and petty outburst'—those are his very words
1	natasha lit the candles and sat down
1	his horse had been shot from under him , and his arm had been slightly grazed by a bullet
1	his face was tender , pitiful
1	m d akhrosimov and denisov are exceptional characters to whom i involuntarily and thoughtlessly gave names that closely resemble those of two particularly distinctive and dear real persons of the society of that time
1	he came to the grandmother 's almost every summer , usually very sick , to rest and recuperate
1	he at once took prince shch
1	and she left the room
1	and how angry she was with me when i explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as i poor marfa petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery , and if i had only cared to , i might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime
1	more than two thousand people had watched , like a performance , the four friends ' successful fanfaronnade , a fanfaronnade of which they were far from suspecting the real motive
1	i , too , went over—and i do not understand why i also found this young man likable , as it were ; maybe by his all-too-spectacular violation of conventional and banalized proprieties ; in short , i failed to discern the fool in him ; anyhow , we were on familiar terms there and then , and as we got off the train , i chapter five learned from him that he would be coming to tverskoy boulevard that evening after eight
1	pierre wanted to write down all the money he had on the list of alms , but was afraid of showing pride and wrote down the same amount as the others did
1	and besides , it would have been one thing if stepanov had suffered ; but he had been vindicated by all the officers without that
1	he was lying , lying , by god !
1	then don ’ t tell it
1	ah , don ’ t let it slip away !
1	you did not warn me , and today i demanded my month 's salary from him
1	and there was something else here as well , too awful and disturbing
1	so your orders are to take the big sterlet ?
1	of simonov 's two guests , one was ferfichkin , from russian-german stock – short , monkey-faced , a fool who comically mimicked everyone , my bitterest enemy even in the lower grades — a mean , impudent little fanfaron who played at being most ticklishly ambitious , though of course he was a coward at heart
1	what are you grinning at : that i ’ ve disgraced myself with you ?
1	he promised we would dine in a private room with athenian women , and he served up the pockmarked one instead of the women , and , besides that , i did not finish eating and froze in the cold a sure eighteen roubles ' worth
1	god rest her soul , exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna
1	no , that 's loathsome water it 's not good enough , he muttered to himself
1	the second day of september was warm and still , but gray
1	oui , oui , je comprends , j'ai compris au commencement prince , anna andreevna raised her voice , you insult me and allow me to be insulted !
1	one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would come from such a description of the duel that took place
1	we convey this anecdote to the public , vouching for its veracity
1	raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion
1	oh , with what happiness i shall press you to my heart !
1	i do not know how to say it ; but highly developed people , it seems to me , can not have triumphant and victoriously happy faces
1	but nothing would have turned him back : his decision was taken
1	i was not vouchsafed a personal interview at nine o'clock precisely razumihin reached the lodgings at bakaleyev 's house
1	be that as it may , only stepan kuzmich left you a deed of gift for that very estate i have been talking about
1	he will say , 'come forth ye drunkards , come forth , ye weak ones , come forth , ye children of shame !
1	having snapped out these last words in soldierly fashion and waved his arms as if throwing something on the ground , the drummer , a lean and handsome soldier of about forty , sternly looked the soldier-singers over and narrowed his eyes
1	always wakes you up
1	pierre 's subjection consisted in his not daring , not only to flirt , but even to talk smilingly with another woman , not daring to go to clubs or dinners just to pass the time , not daring to spend money on whims , not daring to leave for long periods of time except on business , in which his wife also included his intellectual pursuits , of which she understood nothing , but to which she ascribed great importance
1	ah , pla he began , and did not finish
1	that 's why i speak
1	all day sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety
1	kindly do as you are ordered
1	i will be especially grateful to you ; and i am very glad that this incident has afforded me the pleasure of making your acquaintance
1	but your ideal is too low , they will say with scorn
1	only here it would call for a deacon , or at least a subdeacon
1	so 'he took his suffering
1	when rumors of this reached kiev and the theologian khalyava heard , finally , that such had been the lot of the philosopher khoma , he fell to thinking for a whole hour
1	you lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly
1	as she was putting on a tacked together and still sleeveless bodice , turning her head to see in the mirror how the back fitted , she heard animated voices from the drawing room , one her father 's and the other a woman 's voice which made her blush
1	a swishing is often heard in the carpathians , the sound as of a thousand mill wheels turning in the water
1	i just stood there
1	kolya , lida , where are you going ?
1	well , who told you i am not meeting a lover ?
1	good-bye , dear heart , said tushin , you good soul !
1	i somehow did not dare to start comforting her , though i often came precisely with that intention ; but in her presence i somehow had difficulty approaching her , and i could not come up with the right words to begin speaking about it
1	he drank several glasses of lafite with pleasure , then pulled the blanket over his head ; his consciousness went dim , and he fell asleep
1	with a sinking heart and a nervous tremor , he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal , and on the other into the street
1	alpatych named for him some muzhiks whom he knew and from whom he ordered the carts to be taken
1	he ca not do anything , ca not speak , but i understand everything he wishes with his dear eyes
1	i do not wash it , and rent it out to lambert unwashed as it is , for crushing other people 's heads on occasions that lambert finds ticklish
1	but rostov had noticed his first reaction
1	but , we hasten to say , the young man 's sadness came less from regret for his lost happiness than from the fear he felt lest some misfortune befall the poor woman
1	i will tell you about myself , count
1	where are you going ?
1	strange to say , he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm ; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late
1	felton stepped ashore , climbed the little crest that led to the top of the cliff , saluted milady a last time , and set out for the town
1	it was past two o'clock and no one was asleep yet when the quartermaster appeared with orders to set out for the little village of ostrovna
1	i am always ready to have a talk with you ; the sooner the better , even
1	in the bell tower there was also scurrying and shouting
1	he crossed over to him , but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging , as though he had made no sign to him
1	he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise
1	boundless spite came over ganya , and his rage exploded without restraint
1	i have , too , a very important legal affair in the senate , not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture
1	is everything all right with you there ?
1	well , replied the latter , blushing , what must i do ?
1	he came in already knowing all the rumors spread among the public and having perhaps even contributed to them himself
1	only please don ’ t be triumphant , dear boy , she ’ s not yours ; i won ’ t believe it , and it will never be !
1	ippolit stopped , looked at him intently and with relish , shifted his gaze to varya , grinned , bowed , and left without adding a single word
1	the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten their morning conversation , that his decision remained in force , and that it was only owing to the presence of the guests that he did not tell her so now
1	only he was forced to keep silent , having no understanding of the language being spoken around him
1	oh , how low i have sunk !
1	porfiry could not sit still
1	know , then , that if i hate anyone here , he screamed , wheezing , shrieking , spraying from his mouth , and i hate all of you , all of you ! —but you , you jesuitical , treacly little soul , idiot , millionairebenefactor , i hate you more than anyone or anything in the world !
1	i gave a start , and understanding immediately came back to me part two in full force
1	cried lizaveta prokofyevna , but she seized one herself and sat down facing ippolit
1	besides , kitty would not want to live on the rue aux ours , would you , kitty ?
1	he pointed to the bottle
1	as before , they still never spoke of him , so as not to violate with words , as it seemed to them , that lofty feeling that was in them , and this silence about him had the effect that little by little , without believing it , they began to forget him
1	there were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five
1	i quickly left the house
1	[ ] and still less comprehensible remains the ceasing of this movement once a reasonable , holy purpose for the campaign—the deliverance of jerusalem—had been set by the historical actors
1	this politic of louis xiii made richelieu smile
1	they say he 's accessible to eveghrybody , thank god
1	no , and you , porthos ?
1	natasha listened with concentrated attention , trying to understand the meaning of his words , and not understanding
1	well , to you , to you alone i ’ ll tell the truth , because you can see through a man : words , deeds , lies , truth—they ’ re all there together in me and completely sincere
1	lizaveta prokofyevna did not say a word to him all the way , but he seemed not to notice it
1	he was sooner troubled by another thought that tormented him
1	marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man
1	and did you see the princess ?
1	and do you know the man who committed this ravishment ?
1	and darya frantsovna , a woman of evil character and very well known to the police , had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady
1	pensez , il y va du salut de son âme ah !
1	had he really been expecting something or not ?
1	i find his faces even more expressive than titian 's
1	i can imagine nothing more awful !
1	katerina ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl , wearing a torn straw hat , crushed in a hideous way on one side , was really frantic
1	not a single layman to sixty head of clergy , and this is a horrible thought , a historical thought , a statistical thought , finally , and it is from such facts that the knowing man constructs history ; for it is asserted with numerical exactitude that the clergy lived at least sixty times more happily and freely than the rest of mankind at that time
1	a big thing if a sow goes out in the street !
1	then i told you that at andronikov 's everybody read a lot , and the young ladies knew many poems by heart and played scenes from woe from wit among themselves , and that last week we all read a hunters sketches aloud together , and that i loved krylov 's fables most of all and knew them by heart
1	my father had always seen talent in him and was particularly well-disposed toward him for that
1	hearing this answer , velchaninov , who was pacing the room , suddenly stopped almost solemnly in front of pavel pavlovich :
1	he was terribly worried
1	sounds like the clink of money , said the inspector , hearing something thud on the floor and unable to see it for the quickness of chartkov 's movement as he rushed to pick it up
1	the waiter with the platter bellowed , kneeling down
1	i keep creating the scene in the cathedral , just so , imagining it in my head
1	if he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment , he would not have stirred , would hardly have heard the sentence to the end
1	the girls cooed plaintively , at the same time glancing at him with bitterness
1	i spent whole hours looking out my windows at the sky , the birds , the avenues , read everything that came in the mail , slept
1	but are not you suffering , too ?
1	the prince was very glad to be left alone at last ; he went down from the terrace , crossed the road , and entered the park ; he wanted to think over and decide about a certain step
1	kolya stopped , was about to say something , but lebedev pulled him after him
1	why , there could not be a kinder soul than hers !
1	seeing denisov , this man hastily flung something into the bushes and , taking off his soaked hat with its drooping brim , went up to his commander
1	well , all right , speak the truth , he said heavily , obviously after a great struggle
1	at the present moment she 's in paris
1	yes , yes , we must flee , mme bonacieux repeated , but without being able to take a step : terror nailed her to the spot
1	the dreadful news of the battle of borodino , of our losses in dead and wounded , and the still more dreadful news about the loss of moscow , were received in voronezh in the middle of september
1	prince andrei regained consciousness in the morning
1	there 's no way to tell
1	raskolnikov asked , as though startled
1	but , precisely because of that rage , he was blind ; otherwise he would long since have paid attention to the fact that this idiot , whom he mistreated so , was sometimes capable of understanding everything all too quickly and subtly , and of giving an extremely satisfactory account of it
1	that muzhik was telling , the one there at mozhaisk where the battle was , it took ten villages to cart them off , and they were twenty days at it , and there were still some dead left
1	right after his wife , the general put in his own little word :
1	he arrived at s in the morning and took the best room in the hotel , where the whole floor was covered with gray army flannel and there was an inkstand on the table , gray with dust , with a horseback rider , who held his hat in his raised hand , but whose head was broken off
1	give up the old things , forget them as if they would never been , as if it was only a dream , and start a new life
1	nastasya from a distance could not have noticed , thank god !
1	he was fat as could be
1	a poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart
1	only the recognition of that feeling in him made the people choose him in such a strange way—him , an old man in disgrace—against the will of the tsar , as representative of the national war
1	i could not bear it
1	the dream was at once conveyed triumphantly to lizaveta prokofyevna by her two laughing sisters ; but the mother again became angry and called all three of them fools
1	and vile is he who calls him vile for that , he added a moment later
1	the french columns that had moved out of the village went back , but , as if in punishment for this failure , the enemy set up ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at tushin
1	one ran each side
1	in this vice at least there is something permanent , founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy , something present in the blood like an ever‐burning ember , for ever setting one on fire and , maybe , not to be quickly extinguished , even with years
1	only no , dearie , you are obsolete !
1	si jeune et accablé de cette richesse , que de tentations n'aura-t-il pas a subir !
1	is it for this that i named you captain of my musketeers , that they should murder a man , stir up a whole quarter , and try to burn down paris without your saying a word ?
1	she exclaimed , raising her hand to her face and as if trying to cover herself with it
1	and do you think i enjoy talking about them ?
1	he was being shown out by the landlady ( the landlord had not come home from work yet )
1	it 's a good place
1	what did you do with her , if you do not have her anymore ?
1	it was a long and narrow closet ; at the height of my shoulder , not more , the angle between the wall and the roof began , the top of which i could touch with my palm
1	it communicates with my mistress 's bedroom by that door
1	they all seemed fully immersed in these occupations
1	there 's only one partition between my room and milady 's ; in the one you hear everything that 's said in the other
1	he obviously listened only because he had ears , which , despite the fact that one of them was stopped up with hemp , could not help listening ; but it was obvious not only that he could not be surprised or interested in anything the general on duty could tell him , but that he knew beforehand everything he was being told and listened to it only because he had to listen , as one has to listen to the singing of a prayer service
1	so we can just as well founder four horses as one
1	going into his little room , andrei handed the letter to his wife and said :
1	he himself would have been unable to say how long he had been sitting there
1	you know , marie , he said , today ilya mitrofanych ( this was the business manager ) came from the tambov estate and told me that they are now offering eighty thousand for the timber , and with an animated face , nikolai began talking about the possibility of buying back otradnoe in a very short time
1	good gracious , ivan ivanovich !
1	life in kolomna is terribly solitary : there is rarely a carriage , except maybe the kind actors go around in , which with its rumbling , jingling , and clanking is all that disturbs the universal silence
1	i just ran to fetch some water , said mishka
1	shivers kept running down his spine
1	raskolnikov cried , with positive anger
1	you are all bought , bought outright , and why try to obtain love if everything is possible without love ?
1	and he talked so strangely ; it seemed somehow comprehensible , but yet but how , how !
1	sonia flew at him again
1	lord de winter asked in his mocking and contemptuous voice
1	i ask you to carry out my will , afanasy ivanovich , said pulkheria ivanovna
1	raskolnikov thought with repulsion
1	perhaps every fiancee feels the same way before her wedding
1	the french , finding no owners , settled everywhere not as in quarters in a town , but as in a camp located in a town
1	in the middle stood the black coffin
1	well , god be with you
1	raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance , though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon , but even perhaps could have walked about
1	it 's even hard to believe he 's no longer in the world !
1	let me try it on
1	leave again this very moment
1	and he therefore gave gapka orders to keep an eye out at all times everywhere for dry straw stuck someplace or other
1	and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days !
1	for a whole month , and a drunk man can not only be married off but can even be seduced into a different faith
1	can this be another attempt at vengeance from that woman ?
1	what 's the good of these theaters ?
1	denisov was dressed in a cossack coat , wore a beard and an icon of st nicholas the wonderworker on his chest , and in his manner of speaking , in all his ways , expressed the singularity of his position
1	he said , shaking his head—why , she is quite a child !
1	i ’ ve told you everything
1	he knew sonya would pass that way
1	she seemed not to understand
1	young girls with a whole mercer 's shop of ribbons wound round their heads , and with beads , crosses , and coin necklaces on their necks , tried to make their way still closer to the iconostasis
1	but is not he dead ?
1	involuntarily , general events group themselves around some specific occurrence
1	vereshchagin was tried and sentenced to death , thought rastopchin ( though the senate had only sentenced vereshchagin to hard labor )
1	do you suppose—— pulcheria alexandrovna continued warmly
1	i am not saying i regret ; no , i will never utter that phrase , which would not be orthodox the jesuit raised his arms to heaven , and the curate did the same
1	no , replied pierre , laughing and looking over his big , fat body
1	i did it just like that … to test you
1	but now that the prince had begun to speak , they became still more worried
1	are you ill , eh ?
1	fortunately , mikhail averyanych got bored sitting in the hotel room , and after dinner he went out for a stroll
1	at the very beginning of the campaign , our armies are cut in two , and the one goal we aim at consists in reuniting them , though for retreating and luring the enemy into the depths of the country , uniting the armies is not advantageous
1	between them , a little to the side , was a small , round table
1	in the study there were four gentlemen from the diplomatic corps
1	another two or three months of going a bit hungry—and akaky akakievich had , indeed , about eighty roubles
1	but at the critical moment , the courier who brought the news of our victory at pultusk brings us from petersburg our nomination as commander in chief , and the first enemy , buxhöwden , is sunk : we can think about the second , bonaparte
1	nothing but lovely childishness , sir !
1	it 's seductively clear and you mus not think about it
1	it 's a shame , pyotr petrovich !
1	so it was with the help of his mother 's memory , plus a few books of local history and old ukrainian epic songs , that gogol set about creating the little russia of evenings on a farm near dikanka and mirgorod
1	roared razumihin ; but raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer
1	how did it happen ?
1	nobody liked the idea
1	on such occasions she usually stopped talking and merely looked at her brother silently , mockingly , not taking her eyes off him
1	and if anyone had added that aglaya ’ s note was a love letter , setting up a lovers ’ tryst , he would have burned with shame for that man and might have challenged him to a duel
1	aglaya suddenly boiled over and raised her head
1	a man was ushered in , of rather simple bearing and with the air of a bourgeois
1	no , i did not dream that father had killed my mother , and i saw nothing of the dead men
1	katerina quietly sighed and began to rock the cradle
1	where were you all night ?
1	vi : the new fantasy of an idle man
1	prompting you and giving you every means for your defence ; illness , i said , delirium , injury , melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it ?
1	but such reasoning no longer helped
1	he didn ’ t say anything about the theft
1	nikolay is a brick , for confessing and how clear it all is now !
1	i saved it for you yesterday , but you came in late
1	but why did the man attack porthos rather than anyone else ?
1	no one could reproach them with haughtiness or presumption , and yet it was known that they were proud and knew their own worth
1	and , first of all , in my opinion , a baby is too small , that is , not of large size , so that for a given period of time he would need three or five times the number of lay babies as of clergymen , so that the sin , while diminishing on the one hand , would in the final end be increased on the other , if not in quality , then in quantity
1	but katerina nikolaevna would not do that for anything ; —so at least they maintained afterwards
1	prince andrei went to her , stroked her head , and asked whether she had rested from the journey
1	there are no more doubts here , nor any hopes : she has announced it all by the portrait … and what , did he show it to you himself ?
1	berg smiled meekly , kissed the count on the shoulder , and said that he was very grateful , but that he was quite unable to settle into the new life now without receiving thirty thousand in cash
1	sitting on a branch just by the window , holding on to the tree with his arm , he looks : there is no candle in the room , yet it is light
1	not for nothing has age-old popular experience taught us that against poverty and prison there is no guarantee
1	you would not believe how stupid they are !
1	and my father can not bear that
1	was there a childhood love ?
1	the princess left towards evening the next day , and pierre 's head steward arrived with news that it was impossible to get hold of the money needed to equip a regiment unless one of the estates was sold
1	as soon as the curtain rose , the boxes and parterre all fell silent , and all the men , old and young , in uniforms and tailcoats , all the women , in precious stones on bare bodies , with greedy curiosity turned their attention to the stage
1	her husband did not like entertainment of any sort and stayed at home on sundays , and so did she
1	they could not understand that i do not have what it takes , do not have the sort of good-natured and bustling banality needed for it
1	i love you madly
1	send at once and fetch it
1	some of yesterday 's , answered nastasya , who was still standing there
1	her voice was a dense and sonorous contralto , but she always spoke calmly and softly , always lowering her long lashes slightly , and with a smile barely flitting over her pale face
1	she came home , however , still keeping hold of herself , but she could not help telling mama
1	he was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the x prospect , when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw svidrigaïlov , sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth
1	i sighed still more deeply and hastened to take my leave , because i was traveling on important business , and got into my kibitka
1	what is there to explain ?
1	it was also a photograph , of an incomparably smaller size , in a slender oval wooden border—the face of a girl , thin and consumptive and , for all that , beautiful ; pensive and at the same time strangely devoid of thought
1	an error , maybe , the old commander in chief thought
1	here we have an embarras de richessee maybe i should tell about that same theft again , to convince afanasy ivanovich that one can steal without being a thief
1	that seems beats everything !
1	ivan ivanovich went on
1	there 's an ache in my head and an ache in my heart
1	you know , terebyeva ( who is in the community now ) was blamed because when she left her family and devoted herself , she wrote to her father and mother that she would not go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh , that she might have spared them and have written more kindly
1	'your excellency , i said , 'protect the orphans , for you knew my late husband , semyon zaharovitch , and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter
1	he brought us in nothing but misery
1	it must be snow—this spot ; a spot—une tache , thought rostov
1	she was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him
1	you could see it for yourself ; and how could i ?
1	kovrin began to read further , but understood nothing and dropped it
1	silence is always beautiful , and a silent person is always more beautiful than one who talks
1	could it be simply to conceal it from me , knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that i do not approve of private benevolence , which effects no radical cure ?
1	he handed alpatych a paper
1	once i reached for the bottle of red wine ; the pockmarked one suddenly took a bottle of sherry and handed it to me , having not said a word to me till then
1	the adults began talking about bonaparte
1	and how can you judge what would have been better !
1	when mikhail ivanych came in , his eyes were filled with tears of remembrance of the time when he had been writing what he was now reading
1	to inform kutuzov of their intention , they sent him an envelope containing , instead of a message , a blank sheet of paper
1	and where is it now ?
1	then he remembered that self-satisfied bonaparte with his white little hand , who was now an emperor , whom the emperor alexander liked and respected
1	mon cher , vous êtes un héros , said bilibin
1	they have no real evidence
1	you treat me like a sick person or a child
1	varka does it out of vanity , out of boastfulness , so as not to lag behind her mother
1	and so it happened
1	the three musketeers she did
1	you can find lodgings for five roubles a month , even with morning coffee
1	she vomited up every curse there is against you
1	some madman , or fool , or villain in a mad state , gives a slap in the face , and the man is dishonored for the rest of his life and can ’ t wash it off except with blood , or if the other one begs forgiveness on his knees
1	she hardly ever left the house , and of those who came to see them , she was glad only of pierre
1	d'artagnan said to himself
1	would you like to go to the study ?
1	the prince stopped ; from under his thick , beetling brows , his lively , bright , stern eyes looked around at everyone and rested on the young princess
1	i did not ask the one carrying me about anything , i waited and was proud
1	he smiled at the memory of that time and of his love for natasha , and went on at once to what now concerned him passionately and exclusively
1	the curtains were drawn , but it was not totally dark , because a weak light was coming from the other room , where there were no such curtains
1	it can not be , muttered dounia , with white lips
1	the cossack stuck himself out from under the wagon to have a closer look at petya
1	besides , we have got to try out our weapons
1	i wo not lose sight of him
1	as naturally , and simply , and gradually as kutuzov had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to raise a militia , and then to the army , precisely when he was needed , so now , just as naturally , gradually , and simply , when kutuzov 's role had been played , there appeared in his place the new leader required
1	what the devil could this handkerchief mean ?
1	versilov once said that othello killed desdemona and then himself not because he was jealous , but because his ideal was taken from him
1	athos spoke of the discretion of grimaud , who only spoke when his master unstitched his lips ; porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton , who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary constitution ; aramis , confident of bazin 's cleverness , the three musketeers made a pompous speech in praise of his candidate ; finally , d'artagnan had complete faith in planchet 's bravery , and recalled the way he had behaved himself in the thorny business at boulogne
1	because of the self-assurance with which he spoke , no one could make out whether what he had said was very clever or very stupid
1	other young misses observed , passing by
1	however , when the king 's name sometimes suddenly came up unexpectedly in the midst of all these cardinalesque gibes , a sort of gag stopped all these mocking mouths ; the men glanced around hesitantly and seemed to fear the indiscretion of m de tréville 's office wall ; but soon some allusion brought the conversation back to his eminence , and then the laughter picked up again even more , and none of his actions was spared the light
1	( sonia looked wildly at him , and started )
1	i did not want to go anywhere else
1	darkness and gloom , pierre repeated , yes , yes , i understand that
1	well , what of it ?
1	she 's singing , and with me here !
1	they are all perplexed
1	don ’ t blush , prince , or i ’ ll feel sorry for you
1	at least they would have withdrawn on their own ; for they had no water for their men and horses
1	but is he a pure man ?
1	then , oblivious for a moment , she gazed at korostelev and thought : is not it boring to be a
1	he knew that all the intelligentsia of petersburg was gathered there , and , like a child in a toy shop , he looked everywhere at once
1	she turned bright red and said abashedly that i was exaggerating
1	in general , such heroism as the russian troops displayed is impossible to imagine and praise worthily !
1	but how to set about it , if all attempts so far had proved unsuccessful ?
1	he muttered going out
1	he tittered , quite confused , and suddenly went into such a fit of coughing that for some two minutes he was unable to go on
1	so you are here ?
1	all these movements were performed for him in mechanical fashion
1	let it be a dream , but let them not take this dream away from us
1	the man who devastated france , alone , without conspiracy , without soldiers , comes back to france
1	she despised the public just as he did , for its ignorance and indifference to art ; she interfered at rehearsals , corrected the actors , looked after the conduct of the musicians , and when the local newspaper spoke disapprovingly of the theater , she wept , and then went to the editorial offices for an explanation
1	i know it for a fact , it was repeated to me exactly !
1	and all that he has done for rodya ah
1	bring my carriage , he said
1	it even seemed to him that something was moving on that white spot
1	he wanted to tell me even then what he told me on the day of his death , she thought
1	please do not think it too familiar here , on the sofa
1	it was clear that the officer could control his face at will : the moment kutuzov turned around , the officer managed to make a scowl and then assume a most serious , deferential , and innocent expression
1	i know that you do not believe it , but indeed , life will bring you through
1	the king profited from that first the three musketeers moment of reversal to tell her that he was intending to give a fête in the near future
1	all the old methods , which had invariably been crowned with success-concentrating the batteries on a single point , attacking with the reserves to break the line , attacking with les hommes de fer [ ] of the cavalry—all these methods had already been employed , and not only was there no victory , but from all sides the same news came of killed and wounded generals , of the need for reinforcements , of the impossibility of dislodging the russians , and of disarray among the troops
1	i understand precisely nothing
1	but that ’ s what makes it so outrageous , that there was nothing serious in it !
1	he 's a bear cub himself , and here he 's teaching us about polish
1	this humility towards me from such a man , from such a worldly and independent man , who had so much of his own , at once resurrected in my heart all my tenderness for him and all my trust in him
1	yesterday morning , when we were shouting in my study before nashchokin 's arrival
1	but by the significance of this significant gaze it was impossible to tell whether he agreed or disagreed , was satisfied or dissatisfied with the disposition
1	it 's only in that sense i speak of their right to crime in my article ( you remember it began with the legal question )
1	i was so used to thinking and imagining everything from books , and to picturing everything in the world to myself as i had devised it beforehand in my dreams , that at first i did not even understand this strange circumstance
1	half an hour later he was arguing loudly with his lawyer , but that evening and night he was again in the vilest and most fantastic anguish
1	d'artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly
1	what a lot of red camellias i cut !
1	cutting through the upper left of this amphitheater , the smolensk high road wound its way through a village with a white church that lay five hundred paces from the barrow and below it ( this was borodino )
1	i wo not drink anything , said raskolnikov
1	then he sank into dreary musing again
1	i will note that my position in the regiment made this risky ; for such a letter before an encounter , i would be subjecting myself to public opinion you understand ?
1	a woman branded by the justice of the land , a woman who married one man in france and another in england , a woman who poisoned her second husband and who tried to poison me !
1	i know , gentlemen , that many people consider me an idiot , and chebarov , going by my reputation for giving money away easily , thought it would be very easy to deceive me , counting precisely on my feelings for pavlishchev
1	and my circumstances are so bad , anna mikhailovna went on sadly , lowering her voice , so bad that i am now in a most terrible position
1	evgeny pavlovich even stepped back in surprise
1	he quickly inquired about the details , primarily the time , the place , and the degree of reliability
1	some of them seemingly had no need at all to ask ; who the devil could have had any need of it , i would like to know ?
1	the englishmen were all men of the highest quality
1	i murmured something in reply and held out both hands to him ; he joyfully shook them in his
1	they kissed pierre , and he kissed the beautiful hélène 's hand several times
1	but this retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch
1	my goodness , how he sleeps !
1	had been so struck by all this terror that they were even afraid to mention certain things in conversation with evgeny pavlovich , though they knew that even without that , he was well acquainted with the story of aglaya ivanovna ’ s latest passions
1	and that shoulder was rising and falling convulsively and regularly
1	is not it true that he 's not like him at all ?
1	did milord lose them , or does he think they were stolen from him ?
1	thump him on the back !
1	i will be back in an instant , and if you will wait half a minute for me , as soon as i am finished with that friend , i will come to fetch you , and , as it 's beginning to get late , i will bring you back to the louvre
1	the confidence with which d'artagnan spoke convinced patrick—that was the name of this minister 's minister
1	raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him
1	sonia sat down hurriedly
1	i ’ m going out of passion , out of inclination , because i have a major goal
1	and anya 's brothers , petya and andryusha , both high-school students , pulled him from behind by the tailcoat and whispered in embarrassment :
1	better let us have the whole truth pyotr petrovitch may be angry or not , now !
1	and you ca not possibly do otherwise , you have hit on the right thing
1	that same year everybody abandoned their dugout homes and moved to the village ; but there was no peace from the accursed basavriuk there either
1	and yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it excuse me , i have very little wit myself , razumihin cut in sharply , and so let us drop it
1	i brought some along , i have got them here , he pointed to the bags , a hundred flints
1	pah , what a vile room , ganya observed , looking around disdainfully , dark and windows on the courtyard
1	but let me warn you that i do not believe you !
1	but what did you prove by it ?
1	after a moment he thought better of it and , in shame , drove away his absurd notion
1	among plans that would later be realized , we find a heading all in capitals , a thought ( poem ) / theme with the title : 'the emperor , followed by two pages of notes for a story based on the strange life of the russian emperor ivan vi , better known as ivan antonovich , who lived from to
1	the question it poses hangs over the whole novel : what if christ was only a man ?
1	however , that 's all not worth as he spoke , he somehow stared into space , began phrases and broke them off
1	berg returned , and over a bottle of wine the conversation of these three officers became animated
1	all this only seemed strange then to pierre
1	all the while matvei savvich was telling his story , kuzka sat on a stone by the gate , his head propped in his hands , looking at the sky
1	no one had looked , then !
1	pyotr petrovitch asked of zossimov
1	d'artagnan and planchet did not need to hear it twice
1	we stopped at cyrus of persia
1	he had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination
1	i never revealed anything about that meeting with my brother to anyone , not even to marya ivanovna , or to liza in petersburg ; that meeting was the same as receiving a shameful slap in the face
1	and what 's the point ?
1	that 's what she accuses me of
1	a moment later , the jingling of spurs came from the stairway , then footsteps approached , then the door opened , and a man appeared
1	then he was an author ?
1	the old countess , waiting for her son and husband , was playing patience with an old gentlewoman who lived in their house
1	a coward and a fool !
1	the sun came out completely , appeared on the horizon , and vanished into the long , narrow cloud that stood above it
1	here , at the extreme left flank , bennigsen spoke a great deal and vehemently , and , as it seemed to pierre , gave instructions that were important in a military respect
1	only , of course , that ’ s not the worst thing you ’ ve done , darya alexeevna said with loathing
1	pierre decided to himself , and i know this is the last time we will see each other
1	he stood up , paced a little , and sat down
1	earlier she was clowning like an actress , frightening us for the fun of it …
1	that the matter was becoming more and more embroiled
1	a silver crescent gleams in the sky
1	he was wearing gloves , a white waistcoat , and held his hat in his hand
1	afterwards , when varya was already married , nina alexandrovna and ganya moved with her to ptitsyn ’ s , in the ismailovsky quarter ; as for general ivolgin , a quite unforeseen circumstance occurred with him at almost that same time : he went to debtors ’ prison
1	velchaninov had not visited in far too long , and the children were wild with joy : he was loved
1	if the pendants have not left for france already , they will not arrive before you do
1	lxiii : a drop of water first of all , said milady , it may be that i am mistaken and that d'artagnan and his friends really are coming to your rescue
1	the duc d'orléans was visiting the posts
1	each to his own place , mother
1	ach , hang it , only ten minutes left !
1	then sophie , if she 's a girl with a heart , what sort of life will it be for her ?
1	countess marya heard him out , made her comments , and in turn began to think her thoughts aloud
1	morel , pointing to his shoulders , tried to bring it home to the soldiers that this was an officer and that he needed to get warm
1	the guests were all acquaintances of the prince , but it was strange that they had all gathered at once , as if they had been invited , though the prince had not invited anyone , and he himself had only just chanced to remember about his birthday
1	she sat down facing me , on a chair by the wall , smiling and not saying a word
1	i want to sing carols , that 's all !
1	and i tell you once and for all , my dear boy , he said , into the fire with all these things
1	there 's a fop with a fiddle who comes here and scrapes away ; i know tanya wo not marry him , i know it very well , but i hate the sight of him !
1	i should like to make certain myself
1	when everyone had gone down to the garden again , pavel pavlovich suddenly rushed over to velchaninov and tugged him by the sleeve
1	a doctor and priest wore spoken of
1	let me tell you , he is already being watched ; they are already on his track
1	what the result of this courtship might be , anatole could not reflect upon or know , as he never knew what the result of any of his actions would be
1	she particularly liked pinching and dealing out swats to her sister 's children , peaching on them for stolen sugar or bread , which caused an endless and unquenchable quarrel between her and her elder sister
1	this was prince bolkonsky
1	sonia did not think it at all funny
1	i sometimes wake up at night ; so i will go in and look at him
1	men 's actions are subject to general , immutable laws expressed by statistics
1	aglaya noticed it and trembled with hatred
1	it was a hot july day
1	yes , said d'artagnan , until she gets out
1	shouting their ladies ’ names ,
1	bennigsen turned to a general who came up to him and started explaining the disposition of our troops
1	pavel pavlovich forgot his handkerchief !
1	a bit nippy , choub replied
1	but things were becoming urgent
1	ah , the spring , probably , he thought , looking about
1	it can not be said that pulkheria ivanovna loved her all that much , she was simply attached to her , being used to seeing her all the time
1	whether all the enemy forces were six miles away from us , as we supposed , or were there in that fog , no one knew until past eight o'clock
1	raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat
1	see how the devil fights !
1	please don ’ t stand on ceremony
1	it would all come to the same thing— he would spend it on drink , so the thing had better be with me
1	he loves you very much
1	that will be his punishment—as well as the prison
1	so it must be !
1	asked the regimental commander
1	the man looked at him , startled and wondering
1	well , maybe he really doesn ’ t understand , heh , heh !
1	i thus have the greatest veneration for m le cardinal , he went on , and the most profound respect for his acts
1	then , when he had seen his adversary well wearied , he had sent his sword flying with a vigorous quarte thrust
1	another soldier shook his head
1	yes , i am an illegitimate son , and maybe i did indeed want to take revenge for being an illegitimate son , and maybe indeed on some devil ivanovich , because the devil himself wo not find who 's to blame here ; but remember that i rejected an alliance with the scoundrels and overcame my passions !
1	st nicholas or st vlas , it 's all the same
1	it was not that he understood , but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police‐office with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst , or with anything whatever ; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers , it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life
1	she said , as if afraid to touch the money
1	you know how to present things so that you are always right
1	ippolit suddenly jumped up from his chair as if he had been pulled from it
1	the greater the assembly of people aiming their activity at a single goal , the more sharply set off is the category of people who take a less direct part in the common activity , the more their activity is aimed at giving orders
1	people were passing by , pushing me , i did not feel it
1	lower it , lower its head , he said to a soldier who was holding the french eagle and had inadvertently inclined it before the preobrazhensky standards
1	i just knew you would have it ready for me !
1	the old professor of a boring story , who knows that he has only six months to live , finds something strange happening to him , despite his faith in science and indifference to questions about the darkness beyond the grave
1	now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy , and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect
1	he 's a retrograde , the collaborator said gloomily , drinking his glass
1	with good news , i hope ?
1	his study was a room neither large nor small , furnished with a large writing‐table , that stood before a sofa , upholstered in checked material , a bureau , a bookcase in the corner and several chairs—all government furniture , of polished yellow wood
1	we can talk before we sleep and tomorrow ; but on condition that you never open these pages again
1	i humbly thank you , i will go by myself now , said prince andrei , wishing to rid himself of the staff officer , do not trouble yourself , please
1	a peasant called dushkin , who keeps a dram-shop facing the house , brought to the police office a jeweller 's case containing some gold ear‐rings , and told a long rigamarole
1	but you have got four men against you ; end it , i order you
1	suppose , for example , that it , too , is offended ( and it is almost always offended ) , and it , too , wishes to take revenge
1	a cruel wind was blowing , and winter was indeed coming back , and it did not seem that in two days it would be easter
1	le cabinet de berlin ne peut pas exprimer un sentiment d'alliance , ippolit began , looking around significantly at them all , sans exprimer comme dans sa dernière note vous comprenez vous comprenez et puis si sa majesté l'empereur ne déroge pas au principe de notre alliance
1	and so his eyes were fixed with anxiety on the door through which the king would enter
1	rostov saw the cossacks go past him , the first and second squadrons of hussars , the infantry battalions with the artillery , and then generals bagration and dolgorukov rode past with their adjutants
1	afanasy ivanovich spoke long and eloquently , having appended , in passing so to speak , the very curious piece of information that he was now mentioning the seventy-five thousand for the first time and that no one knew of it , not even ivan fyodorovich himself , who was sitting right there ; in short , no one knew
1	is it true that he kissed the portrait ?
1	it was svidrigaïlov , that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess
1	you have been drinking with him , too !
1	if sofya semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes , i will send her to you , to‐day if you like
1	he stopped to think for a moment , but , following the russian rule , resolved to go ahead
1	a little stairway leads up to the scaffold ; there , facing the stairway , he suddenly burst into tears , and yet he was a strong and manly fellow and was said to be a great villain
1	and even my sole heir , is not that so ?
1	may i go in and look ?
1	inform , if you want to !
1	let 's go , let 's go !
1	do not worry , do not worry , i wo not drink more than a mug !
1	if there was none of this magnanimity in war , we would go to it only when it was worth going to certain death , as now
1	alpatych told him how he had been sent and how he had barely been able to leave
1	the first time the young foreign person allowed himself to reproach her , she proudly raised her beautiful head and , half turning to him , said firmly :
1	then , slowly and attentively , he began reading , and read it through twice
1	but his eyes were accustomed now , so that he could make out the whole bed ; someone was sleeping there , a completely motionless sleep ; not the slightest rustle , not the slightest breath could be heard
1	i would not be able to find a punishment fit for him !
1	that dazzling beauty was even unbearable , the beauty of the pale face , the nearly hollow cheeks and burning eyes—strange beauty !
1	we will learn that luther had a hot temper and said such-and-such things ; we will learn that rousseau was mistrustful and wrote such-and-such books ; but we will not learn why , after the reformation , the peoples slaughtered each other and why , during the french revolution , they executed each other
1	he noticed the impression these words made on his daughter
1	her crimson lips were hot and glowing ; but what was this ?
1	muttered the unknown gentleman , and mounted the stairs behind her
1	while the couples were being placed and the musicians were tuning up , pierre sat with his little partner
1	in two words , sir , pavel pavlovich hurried , i am getting married and am presently going to my fiancee , right now
1	he stood up at once
1	and it would have ended with her understanding everything
1	no , said d'artagnan , it 's a gift from my beautiful englishwoman , or rather my beautiful frenchwoman : for , though i have never asked her , i am convinced she was born in france
1	but as soon as the conversation concerned him personally , he began to speak expansively and with obvious pleasure
1	since death has come , there 's no use
1	the carriage door opened almost at once , the young man jumped down lightly and offered his hand to milady , who leaned on it and descended in her turn with a certain calm
1	the house , unplastered , with timber walls , was not very clean inside—one could see that the aim of those living in it did not consist in keeping it spotless—but there were also no signs of neglect
1	the doctor said that the anxiousness he showed meant nothing , that it had physical causes ; but princess marya thought ( and the fact that her presence always increased his anxiousness confirmed her supposition ) that he wanted to tell her something
1	for nastasya filippovna it was even strange to see aglaya like this ; she looked at her and could not believe her eyes , and was decidedly at a loss for the first moment
1	you must have gone clean out of your mind , man
1	the staff officer said in a tone of reproach , like a man who has already repeated the same thing several times
1	no , my esteemed mikhail averyanych , i do not believe in it and have no grounds for doing so
1	i myself began to feel what i was saying , and became excited
1	he had always suspected , however , that this opinion might contain an error ; he felt it now , too
1	silent and smiling , tushin shifted from one bare foot to the other , and looked question-ingly with his large , intelligent and kindly eyes first at prince andrei , then at the staff officer
1	petya was standing on the porch , handing out weapons to the servants who were leaving moscow
1	i admired , rereading the noteand all because i am a developed and educated man !
1	what you just said
1	instead of answering raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell
1	i say : expand the circle of the society ; let the mot d'ordre [ ] be not only virtue , but independence and activity
1	the story had been everywhere contradicted by marfa petrovna , and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople , who were warm in dounia ' a defence
1	when did it begin , when did it all happen ?
1	that moment , when nikolai saw the dogs swarming over the wolf in the ditch , saw under them the wolf 's gray fur , his outstretched hind leg , and his frightened and gasping head with its ears laid back ( karai had him by the throat ) —the moment when nikolai saw that was the happiest moment of his life
1	finally , in the evening , ivan fyodorovich managed with great difficulty to say good-bye ; and , despite his tractability and their attempts to force him to stay the night , he held to his intention to leave , and left
1	natasha took the first note , her throat expanded , her chest straightened , her eyes acquired a serious expression
1	the scriveners did not dare to say anything against that , and one of them sent to call the superintendent
1	at last the escort traversed paris on the night of the twenty-third
1	besides , who wants to be a card‐sharper ?
1	je l'ai instruit de la chose
1	there was a great outcry and uproar , the children began crying
1	will you make it ?
1	his eyes fastened themselves on the eyes of the queen , and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips : the queen was not wearing her diamond pendants
1	for the limited usual man , for instance , there is nothing easier than to imagine himself an unusual and original man and to revel in it without any hesitation
1	bonacieux picked up , offended by the slight interest he wife showed in him
1	yes , i noticed him , i noticed him well
1	the regiment was also a home , and a home as unchangingly dear and precious as his parental home
1	and she threw a loaf of bread on the table
1	my memory 's quite gone , or i should have thought of something
1	i see that aglaya ivanovna was making fun of me , the prince replied sadly
1	i do not say anything only out of politeness
1	it ’ s as if my heart was pierced through forever
1	and despite all inquiries … could still be heard in the corridor
1	but the real geniuses , asked razumihin frowning , those who have the right to murder ?
1	show me this minute !
1	and i ’ m convinced that her fate is no ordinary one
1	yes , that was how he was
1	the predatory type is the one , he suddenly stopped in fury , is the man who would rather poison bagautov in a glass , while wouldrinking champagne ' with him in the name of a pleasant encounter with him , as you drank with me yesterday—and would not go accompanying his coffin to the cemetery , as you did today , devil knows out of which of your hidden , underground , nasty strivings and clownings which besmirch only you yourself !
1	she felt herself , on the contrary , hardly worthy to look at dounia
1	then marfa petrovna turned up ; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces ( i owed seventy thousand )
1	ah , i see you think i am in such a condition !
1	how could i not know !
1	and he had hardly thought it when , somewhere near , a clock on the wall , ticking away hurriedly , struck three
1	do not leave it for those devils !
1	dear heart , forgive a useless woman ; i will leave now and go away she suddenly got up and began to hurry
1	though , i confess , i wouldn ’ t stay even then , not that there ’ s any reason , but just … by character
1	however , i remember he was already unpardonably gray then , which meant he was just as gray when he married her that might have had an influence
1	he was a picard whom the vainglorious musketeer had hired that same day and for this occasion on the pont de la tournelle , while he was spitting into the water to make rings
1	i went out , and i liked it very much , liked it right then , even at the very moment when he was leading me out ; but for a long time afterwards , in my memory , his words made the painful impression of a sort of strange , contemptuous pity for him , which i did not want to feel at all
1	that was a strange thought
1	what i mean , in fact , is that earlier , in your presence and after you left , ganya said in answer to my question about you : he knows everything , no need for ceremony !
1	but he knew he was not looking thoroughly , that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking
1	after that he shut himself in his room and ardently took up his brush
1	can the process already have begun ?
1	but pulkheria ivanovna would not say anything
1	as if a woman should not work !
1	he saw that the little old man sitting in front of him in the first row of the stalls was carefully wiping his bald head and neck with his glove and muttering something
1	versilov had meant to joke playfully and amicably , but somehow it did not come off , and he only frightened mama still more , who naturally understood nothing in the comparison of her with a newspaper , and she looked around in perplexity
1	his presentiment came true
1	nothing at all no one 's services no one 's sympathy
1	versilov left without noticing me
1	you have got to go mentioning the devil
1	it has its content and even , if you wish , its subject in itself— this prose which steps forth in the free image of speech about facts not worth mentioning , speech in a pure sense about nothing
1	if you like but i warn you it will be perfectly useless
1	but dounia was vexed , and answered that 'words are not deeds , and that , of course , is perfectly true
1	your mug ’ s all bloody !
1	the debate went on for a long time , and the longer it went on , the more heated the argument became , reaching the point of shouting and personal remarks , and the less possible it was to draw any general conclusion from all that had been said
1	placed where he was , d'artagnan could not see aramis 's face—we say aramis , because the young man had no doubt that it was his friend who was carrying on a dialogue from inside with the lady outside
1	but enough , not another word on this subject which you find so extremely interesting
1	now , why go scaring them !
1	when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains to adult consciousness , he involuntarily feels as if he is in a trap from which there is no escape
1	my intention was to warn m de la porte through my husband , so that m de la porte could tell us precisely what has gone on at the louvre over the past three days , and whether it 's dangerous for me to appear there
1	the cossack choub was saying as he came out the door of his cottage to a tall , lean muzhik in a short sheepskin jacket with a stubbly chin that showed it had not been touched in over two weeks by the broken piece of scythe a muzhik usually shaves with for lack of a razor
1	do you know the details of the case ?
1	thank you , rodya , for speaking to me like that we will , we will guard her
1	the elder workman looked at him askance
1	the strangeness and comicality of these answers come from the fact that modern history is like a deaf man , answering questions that no one has asked him
1	i am a ruined man , lost , destroyed !
1	'—anyone will show you
1	the right of pardon applies only to the guilty , said tréville , who wanted to have the last word , and my musketeer is innocent
1	marya grigorievna is a very modest and well-behaved girl !
1	it would be curious to know , precisely what about me struck him ?
1	behind the walls , noise and talk could be heard , which suddenly became clear and loud as the door opened and a lackey came out with a tray laden with empty glasses , a pitcher of cream , and a basket of rusks
1	they are three superb beasts !
1	he said to raskolnikov , as they went out into the street
1	d'artagnan went back to milady 's the next day and the day after that , and each time milady gave him a more gracious welcome
1	he also feeds his neighbor on the left , a paralytic , with a spoon
1	the general , though in disgrace and aware that it was his own fault , pouted for a long time all the same ; he was sorry to lose afanasy ivanovich : such a fortune , and such a dexterous man !
1	i am often vexed by my students ' sins , but this vexation is nothing compared with the joy i have experienced for thirty years , when i talk with my students , lecture to them , study their relations , and compare them with people in other circles
1	the same crowd of people as at cut-rate sales filled all the passes and passageways of the shopping arcade
1	i thought i was scorned , betrayed
1	( she referred to her son that way )
1	his mouth and nose were askew
1	and what if they take me to the police ?
1	he comes to devastate our beloved fatherland , sonya read diligently in her high little voice
1	the day was hot , the air dry and flowing in streams
1	excuse me , captain , he began easily , suddenly addressing nikodim fomitch , will you enter into my position ?
1	and with that—bye-bye , bonzhur
1	shall i go there or not ?
1	it was evident that his intentions were friendly
1	however , it seems nobody noticed , rostov thought to himself
1	velchaninov thought , frowning and feeling for the case in his coat pocket
1	had not he smashed an icon before my eyes ?
1	m le comte de wardes was announced
1	consider , monsieur , the thing is materially impossible
1	i naturally didn ’ t spy and didn ’ t want to ask questions ; however , they received me well , better than i expected , but not a word about you , prince !
1	do not grieve over the baby
1	pyotr petrovitch , go away , she turned to him , white with anger
1	the lord of the land on which the curate 's church was located saw this supposed sister and fell in love with her , so much in love that he proposed marriage to her
1	listen , arkady , you allowed yourself that outburst downstairs , pointing the finger at me in front of your mother
1	yegor announces that a student has appeared
1	just see if i do not get promoted sublieutenant
1	yes , he 's a very , very kind man , when he 's under the influence , not of bad people , but of such people as i , the princess said to herself
1	thank you , prince , for your genuine concern ; it is only too flattering for me , but … i found the money , sir , a long time ago
1	the three musketeers no , madame , but those who look for bargains must allow others to look for more generous friends
1	but then , seeing her father and especially little coco , her intention would weaken , she would weep in quiet and feel she was a sinful woman : she loved her father and her nephew more than god
1	he was appallingly dressed : his clothes torn and dirty , soaked with a night 's rain
1	at first people did not understand the meaning of this bombardment
1	i must confess i do not quite understand him
1	when he was better , he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious
1	he also owed money to the tradeswoman belov
1	however , i do not admit of any genuine madness , the less so as he is not mad at all now
1	liberry instead of library , your excellency
1	he stood there for a minute and—strangely—it suddenly seemed to him that the edge of one blind was raised and rogozhin ’ s face flashed , flashed and disappeared in the same instant
1	at dinner modest alexeich ate a great deal and talked about politics , about appointments , transfers , and bonuses , and that one had to work , that family life was not a pleasure but a duty , that a penny saved was a penny earned ,
1	in the administrative respect , the establishment of the municipality did not put an end to the looting and proved useful only to certain persons who took part in it and who , under the pretext of maintaining order , were themselves looting moscow or saving their own property from being looted
1	but now , now , when the term of the sentence has been read out to me ?
1	she blushed , pressed her hands to her knees , and all at once , obviously making an effort with herself , raised her head and began speaking quickly :
1	first , it would be proved to the insolent prince that there were still people of our estate who understood honor , and , second , versilov would be shamed and learn a lesson
1	yes , yes , i remember
1	the cossack was summoned , questioned ; the cossack commanders wanted to use the occasion to capture some horses , but one of their superiors , who had acquaintances among the upper ranks of the army , reported this fact to a staff general
1	in the beginning , arkady says of versilov : i absolutely had to find out the whole truth in the very shortest time , for i had come to judge this man
1	bakhtin goes so far as to say that dostoevsky 's mode of artistic thinking could not imagine anything in the slightest way humanly significant that did not have certain elements of eccentricity ( in all its diverse manifestations )
1	under the apple tree a fire was forever burning , and the iron tripod was never ukrainian tales without a cauldron or copper pot on it , for preserves , jellies , fruit pastes made with honey , sugar , and i do not remember what else
1	you want to hear a man ’ s nastiest deed and with that you ask him to shine !
1	princess marya threw on her shawl and ran to meet the arrivals
1	when germans start being accurate , there 's no end to it !
1	all right , all right , with me they will be safe
1	valuev told confidentially that uvarov had been sent from petersburg to find out the opinion of the muscovites about austerlitz
1	the princess pretended that she saw nothing more extraordinary in this news than if he had seen some anna semyonovna
1	under such interrogation , ivan fyodorovich involuntarily got up from his seat and stood at attention , something he ordinarily did when his colonel asked him a question
1	a man in a greatcoat lay face downwards ; dead drunk , across the pavement
1	the general , who had listened to the story with extreme attention , became alarmed again and glanced searchingly at ganya
1	was it all put into words , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds , so that there was no need to speak of it aloud , and better not to speak of it
1	the officer rode beyond the line to yechkino
1	it kept seeming to her that she was just on the point of understanding , of penetrating , that terrible , overwhelming question at which her inner gaze was directed
1	and you , nastasya , look in pretty often while i am away , to see whether he wants a drink or anything else
1	if we allow that human life can be governed by reason , the possibility of life is annihilated
1	never mind , you have another charge there
1	as i have told you , we can trust him
1	this time there was no more doubt ; it was at the croix-du-trahoir that they executed inferior criminals
1	my bathing house is nice , as you see , my father built it , but i somehow never have time to bathe
1	but the main thing is that i am ashamed
1	anatole kissed the old man , then looked at him curiously and with perfect calm , expecting him to come out with something eccentric , as his father had promised
1	within half an hour adjutants had been sent out in various directions with orders demonstrating that the russian troops , so far inactive , would soon also have to meet the enemy
1	give it to the countess
1	why should he go now when he knew that it would be so ?
1	no , it ’ s not that the russian soul is murky , but the murkiness was in his own soul , if he could imagine such a horror
1	n‐no , mumbled zossimov ; you may amuse him
1	he almost believed in milady 's tenderness ; he almost believed in de wardes 's crime
1	why , in the next room
1	when she heard that , maman nearly fainted
1	said master danilo , peering at him from behind the bush
1	besides the cause of a general yearning that bound the crowds of the french into a single whole and endowed them with a certain energy , there was yet another cause that bound them together
1	this story is still to come ; what happened that evening was just a prelude : i sat for the whole two hours at the corner of the table , and next to me all the while , on the left , was some rotten little fop—a yid , i think ; he participates somewhere , however , even writes something and gets it published
1	will you pay me back ?
1	what 's to be done ?
1	when he got out of bed , pyotr petrovitch immediately looked in the looking‐glass
1	lebeziatnikov strode into the room
1	the trinity—the three basic elements of things—sulfur , mercury , and salt
1	and for the first time in her life she felt bitter towards the people who had been her benefactors only so as to torment her the more ; she felt envy of natasha , who had never experienced anything like that , who had never needed to sacrifice herself , but made others sacrifice themselves for her , and was loved even so , and for the first time sonya felt her quiet , pure love for nicolas suddenly begin to grow into a passionate feeling , which stood above the rules , and virtue , and religion ; and , under the influence of that feeling , sonya , having been taught by her life of dependence to be secretive , involuntarily answered the countess in general , indefinite terms , avoided talking further with her , and decided to wait for her meeting with nikolai , not in order to free him at that meeting , but , on the contrary , to bind him to her forever
1	now thousands of feet and bayonets moved with flying standards and , at the officers ' command , halted , turned , and lined up at intervals , circling around other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms ; now there came the sounds of the measured thudding and clanking of the dressed-up cavalry , in blue , red , and green embroidered uniforms , with embroidered musicians in front , on black , chestnut , or gray horses ; now , stretching out with the brazen noise of polished , shining cannon shaking on their carriages , and with their smell of linstocks , the artillery crawled between the infantry and cavalry and settled in their appointed places
1	i have known you a long time and love you like a brother , she said
1	he was all so thin , small , and pitiful
1	for some reason , summer and winter alike , he goes about in a fur coat and only on very hot days does not go out but sits at home
1	because she told me you had undertaken to get her one
1	with a word both sure and ardent
1	and you will become inestimably richer than before ; for not only in food , nor in costly clothing , nor in pride nor envy will you be happy , but in immeasurably multiplied love
1	at least you did not deceive yourself for long , you went straight to the furthest point at one bound
1	rostov rode to the tavern ; near the porch he saw telyanin 's horse
1	the portrait showed a woman of extraordinary beauty indeed
1	whatever goods you find in my chest , they all go to the church !
1	the soldiers carried it clumsily and hastily behind the post and began to push it down into the pit
1	vile , nasty in my own home , mean girl , hussy i am only sorry for her father !
1	eight stacks of wheat always stood in front of his house
1	and athos rushed back into the bastion , climbed up to the platform , and removed the flag
1	it must be that my tears are not hot , they can not warm you !
1	i wo not dispute that makar ivanovich might have taken that shoulder as an added mockery , if he had been more clever ; but his honesty then stood in the way of his perspicacity
1	we are not on duty , and we thought that , not being on duty , we could dispose of our time as we saw fit
1	i will go , i thought , and see how things are there
1	and what , tell me , what , what do i care about you and whether you are perishing there or not ?
1	then raskolnikov repeated ( rather dryly ) his conversation with svidrigaïlov , omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of marfa petrovna , wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk
1	she was singing in a half voice , and suddenly , after rising , the voice broke off— such a poor little voice , and it broke off so pitifully ; she coughed and again softly , softly , barely , barely began to sing
1	you can find peace within yourself under any circumstances
1	he was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force , but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth
1	what mainly made me explode was part three that here again some secrets and stupidities emerged , and that these people apparently could not do without secrets and slyness
1	yes , yes ; i have not taken the loop off the armhole !
1	all were looking at her with such awful , stern , ironical , hostile eyes
1	he waved his hand energetically
1	excuse me , allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you , or rather , let me say , has been conveyed to you , has no foundation in truth , and i suspect who in a word this arrow in a word , your mamma she seemed to me in other things , with all her excellent qualities , of a somewhat high‐flown and romantic way of thinking but i was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way and indeed indeed i tell you what , cried raskolnikov , raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing , glittering eyes upon him , i tell you what
1	well , goodbye , matryosha , said anatole , kissing her
1	i assure you , gentlemen , the prince cried , you published your article on the assumption that i would never agree to satisfy mr burdovsky , and so you wanted to frighten me for that and be revenged somehow
1	at thirty-five , as he then was , he rightly passed for the most handsome gentleman and the most elegant cavalier in france and england
1	i merely wanted to observe that from this case it ’ s possible to jump over directly to the right of force , that is , to the right of the singular fist and personal wanting , as , incidentally , has happened very often in this world
1	however , they thought that it ought to be so , since the thing had been done on athos 's orders
1	he remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police-station
1	if you need anything , lipynka , just ask , he said
1	i have heard porthos speak of her , that 's all
1	yes , i respect it and justify it
1	but if she ’ s been hurt , why , then , do you yourselves bring her out in front of that same society in your newspapers and demand that it not hurt her ?
1	so i thought : they must be holy people
1	as for what it was that had nearly made milady lose her credit with the cardinal , kitty knew no more about that ; but this time d'artagnan was ahead of her : as he had seen milady on a detained ship the moment he himself was leaving england , he suspected that this time it was a question of the diamond pendants
1	i left rather in pride than in repentance , and , believe me , quite far from thinking it was time to end my life as a humble bootmaker
1	as the king my father used to say
1	stepan nikiforovich obviously did not wish to expand further
1	listen , said the novice , one must have firm hope in heaven , you see ; a moment always comes when the good one has done pleads one 's case before god , and , you know , perhaps it 's fortunate for you that you should have met me , humble and powerless as i am , for if i leave here , well , then i will have some powerful friends who , after working on my behalf , may also work on yours
1	he had a bit of money , not much , of course , but he did have it ; how much there was in reality—of this no one knew anything , neither his wife , nor his elder daughter , nor his relations
1	nobody told us anything
1	let 's have breakfast , katya , i say
1	he felt for the latch and opened it
1	he was of average height , but that height was so admirably borne and so well proportioned that more than once , in his contests with porthos , whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers , he had forced the giant to yield
1	there was no other , all were occupied
1	we all have our secrets
1	she looked at piskarev with imploring eyes and motioned to him to stay where he was and wait for her to come back , but he , in a fit of impatience , was unable to obey any orders , even from her lips
1	danilo 's voice seemed to fill the whole woods , emerge , and spread far across the field
1	all that is mine is yours , she said , looking at the faces that stood before her
1	he crossed himself several times
1	this afanasy usually stood by the door , his arms crossed , and always muttered one and the same thing with a deep sigh :
1	well , it 's pretty plain
1	when someone came to give her a handkerchief on the part of her seamstress and then ?
1	and now i have become a trite , trashy woman , whom anyone can despise
1	it suddenly seemed to him that one of them , placed just by the window , was—pavel pavlovich , and that he had also seen him and was peeking curiously at him through the window
1	you , for example , want to make man unlearn his old habits , and to correct his will in conformity with the demands of science and common sense
1	let us note parenthetically that gavrila ardalionovich was never even mentioned in the epanchins ’ house—as if there had been no such person in the world , let alone in their house
1	he insisted especially seriously on his genius , as if some extraordinary benefit could be derived from it at that moment
1	his grandfather goes into indescribable raptures , dissolves in merry laughter , and shouts :
1	i even felt sorry for him
1	all i had lying there was nine roubles
1	if the members of the council at first thought kutuzov was pretending to sleep , the sounds his nose produced during the reading that followed proved that for the commander in chief at that moment the point of the matter was something far more important than a wish to show his contempt for the disposition or for anything at all : the point of the matter was to satisfy the irresistible human need for sleep
1	i went home only to sleep
1	there must have been very grave grounds for it , if he is so furious at the word , porfiry laughed
1	i will make you a new overcoat , i will do it up famously , that i will
1	you will be bound , finally , to look at your work as a science ; it will take in the whole of your life and maybe fill the whole of it
1	there , the impatient lizaveta prokofyevna picked up , turning to her daughters , he ’ s begun
1	well , then , when the time is right , i do not say no
1	fanariotov , her grandmother , as her ward , of course ( versilov gave nothing to provide for them ) —but in a far different role from that in which wards are usually described in the houses of aristocratic ladies , for instance , the old countess 's ward in pushkin 's queen of spades
1	in the big town acquaintances turned up ; strangers hastened to make the acquaintance and greet cordially the newly arrived rich man , the biggest proprietor in the province
1	can ’ t you cut pages with a garden knife ?
1	but here the incident becomes totally shrouded in mist , and of what happened further decidedly nothing is known
1	within a year , no one could recognize the woman who so recently had shone and attracted crowds of obedient admirers
1	the jew got angry and also shouted :
1	all this , i repeat , i remember perfectly well
1	why , it is a piano they have got , i declare how they push !
1	you will find me ready to follow you
1	you despise generals and generalship , he sometimes said to him jokingly , but look , all of them ’ will end up as generals in their turn ; if you live long enough , you ’ ll see it
1	she questioned him quickly , spoke rapidly , but seemed to get confused at times and often did not finish ; she kept hurrying to warn him about something ; generally she was extraordinarily anxious , and though she looked at him very bravely and with a sort of defiance , she was perhaps also a little frightened
1	and he had finally returned to petersburg , perhaps , only because he , too , had been discarded like a worn-out old shoe
1	do you know that i am going to get married ?
1	she 's taking care of me
1	but she was indeed no longer lying but sitting up in the coffin
1	the chessmen are set up , the game starts tomorrow
1	as you like , sir , only i wo not read !
1	say rather that you served as an instrument of that cursed woman
1	your man , you say ?
1	well , are you going to argue now ?
1	the forest fastness around the castle hid them
1	but they would ransack the stove first of all
1	a look of terror appeared on the governor 's face
1	of all that happened during that sleep , and of how much time passed while it lasted , i have no memory
1	excuse me , i do not understand what you are talking about
1	i do not like women , because they are rude , because they are awkward , because they are not independent , and because they wear indecent clothes , i concluded my lengthy tirade incoherently
1	he felt that he had , anyway , made these two poor women miserable , that he was , anyway , the cause
1	i could not even have said how tall you were
1	while sitting in the anteroom , pierre looked around with weary eyes at the various officials , old and young , military and civilian , significant and insignificant , who were in the room
1	what do you say to that ?
1	but if i review an act i committed a month ago , i involuntarily recognize , being in different conditions , that if that act had not been committed , many useful , agreeable , and even necessary things which resulted from that act would not have taken place
1	it 's all right , everything worked out very well , nadya told him hurriedly
1	you ’ ve really changed little externally , though i saw you as a child of about ten or eleven
1	by heaven , i do not quite know , he hurt my shoulder
1	if she rebels , i ’ ll drop her at once and take the money with me
1	for his work , petrovich took twelve roubles—it simply could not have been less : decidedly everything was sewn with silk , in small double seams , and afterwards petrovich went along each seam with his own teeth , imprinting it with various designs
1	no , do not trouble yourself , demyan demyanovich
1	then marfa petrovna turned up ; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces ( i owed seventy thousand )
1	supposing that she would come out to him , princess marya thought up the words he would say to her and she to him ; and these words seemed to her now undeservedly cold , now too fraught with significance
1	pulcheria alexandrovna put in hastily
1	i have come to say good-bye
1	sonya was in the reception room , seeing to the packing of the crystal and china
1	true , maybe he was unnecessarily quick to take advantage of his dismissal
1	he shouted , that 's true , he shouted three times , another voice declared
1	on his way home , boris noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house
1	so it was m d'artagnan the stranger was after ?
1	by jove , there he 's blushing again
1	let 's agree once and for all : we can talk about actors , about actresses , or writers , but we will leave art alone
1	he was furnishing a flat foo !
1	not a little patriot at all , but just natasha replied touchily
1	it 's it 's a stern and lovely face , a face out of an english keepsake
1	natasha , what is it ?
1	oh , i forgave her much during that minute when i gradually came to grasp the matter
1	take note , i tell you this about your sister as a fact
1	luzhin stood still , waiting with a defiant and offended face
1	one saw only a strong , beautiful , and fruitful female
1	if he 's stooped to lambert , he will do her in !
1	nikolai and his wife got along so well that even sonya and the old countess , who , out of jealousy , wished for some disagreement between them , could find no pretext for reproach ; but there were also moments of hostility between them
1	there were many reminiscences about the deceased ; tatyana pavlovna told many stories about him that had been quite unknown to me before
1	when it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not ( praskovya pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband ) , the question was angrily answered in the negative
1	and yet this letter in which he recommends you to me ?
1	on both sides of the bridge a number of vehicles crowded , waiting ; people also stopped
1	a peine passe-t-il de notre côté de la rivière , que nous repassons de l'autre , en la fin notre ennemi boukshevden nous attrappe et s'attaque à nous
1	he stood up and took his hat
1	wait what is it ?
1	he gave a start and opened his eyes
1	he began untying the bundle , which evidently interested him
1	tell me , tell me , tell me !
1	the fleeing men returned , the battalions formed up , and the french , who had divided the troops of the left flank in two , were momentarily pressed back
1	kutuzov , without glancing at wolzogen , ordered the order to be written , which , on very good grounds , to avoid personal responsibility , the former commander in chief wished to have
1	i see this is all a childish and empty matter ; tomorrow i will make inquiries of the most esteemed fedosei semyonovich , but now i beg you to spare me , sir
1	we cure and prepare hides , we take work home most of all i was vexed and the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before raskolnikov 's mind ; he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters , women among them
1	i do understand that
1	for the historian ( we continue the example of a battle ) , the main source is the reports of individual commanders and the commander in chief
1	i hope , d'artagnan said seriously , half dead with fright , that you made no mention of my diamond ?
1	through anna andre-evna , i am now looking after his baby
1	but he kept failing and felt awkward about starting this talk
1	she could not bear even a moment of hesitation in him , covered her face with her hands , cried : oh , my god ! —and rushed out of the room , rogozhin going after her to unlock the street door
1	yes , monseigneur , replied the faithful servant of anne d'autriche , but too late , perhaps
1	and it 's all because we want to ape those stupid moscow raptures , said prince vassily , becoming confused for a moment and forgetting that at hélène 's one had to make fun of the moscow raptures , but at anna pavlovna 's to admire them
1	her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall
1	he was a man about fifty , rather tall and thickly set , with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little
1	princess marya knew only too well this mood of quiet and preoccupied grumbling , which usually resolved itself in an outburst of rage , and she went about all morning as if under a loaded and cocked gun , awaiting the inevitable shot
1	i … i ’ ll soon die in my sleep ; i thought last night that i was going to die in my sleep
1	klochkov was the sixth
1	darya alexeevna sat in expectation as if on pins and needles
1	there , he said , sitting down beside anya
1	the steps were heavy , even and unhurried
1	raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty , yellow paper he picked out one clumsy , white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it , how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them
1	filled with rending pity , he sat by a guttering candle
1	mama , my own , can you possibly stay here ?
1	yet the exact nature of their brotherhood remains a mystery
1	what does she write to me ?
1	we have both lived up to now only because each of us thought the other dead , and a memory is less disturbing than a live creature , though a memory can sometimes be a devouring thing !
1	am i right , am i right ?
1	but the song grows stronger , more passionate , more impetuous ; the notes get higher : there are tears in it , anguish , tireless , hopeless , and , finally , despair : 'there is no forgiveness , gretchen , there is no forgiveness for you here !
1	did i thwart you ?
1	that 's how he will keep circling and circling round me
1	pierre could not and did not want to break that silence
1	she also told me to tell you that she always loved you
1	every time i look at my watch and see the hand approaching ten , i hear the bells start to ring in the neighboring church , yet from the fact that the bells start to ring every time the hand reaches ten , i have no right to conclude that the position of the hand is the cause of the movement of the bells
1	the prince turned quickly and looked at the two
1	of all that he , too , later called suffering , but which at the time he hardly felt , the main thing was his bare feet , covered with sores and scabs
1	looking at them , master danilo recalled his battles as if by banners
1	he cried in a sudden spasm of agony , let me be !
1	exactly so , sir , and there 's light in your papa 's study
1	i bet you never thought of that
1	greetings , uncle , we are coming , too , cried petya
1	but go on , my dear , you did very well this time to recall it in such detail i stood , looked at you , and suddenly cried , ah , how good , the real chatsky !
1	it was that feeling on account of which a volunteer recruit drinks up his last kopeck , a man on a drunken binge smashes mirrors and windows without any apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him his last penny ; that feeling on account of which a man does ( in the banal sense ) insane things , as if testing his personal power and strength , claiming the presence of a higher judgment over life , which stands outside human conventions
1	no , it 's too much for me he thought
1	don ’ t believe him , lizaveta prokofyevna
1	the men get a glass of vodka each from me , he added loudly , so that the soldiers could hear
1	he came to milady 's twice
1	it means there was something stronger than fire and flame and even than a twenty-year habit !
1	it is totally unknown how it was saved from the flood
1	your heart is not pounding yet , but somehow hesitates and thrills slightly—a sensation not without pleasure
1	he 's got a screw loose !
1	his face , despite its small , round wrinkles , had an expression of innocence and youth ; his voice was pleasant and melodious
1	eh , soon i will thr-r-row them out on their ears !
1	calm yourself , get up !
1	the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen the count said through happy tears , and he embraced his wife , who was glad to hide her ashamed face on his chest
1	when i came in , this gentleman , who had come in just before me and was unwrapping his provisions , was talking rapidly and heatedly with his wife ; she , though she had not yet finished swaddling the baby , had already begun to whimper ; the news must have been bad , as usual
1	why , on that 'journey ' ; you spoke of it yourself
1	well , sir , in any case i am gla-a-ad to rene-e-ew
1	the queen would be ruined just as well by too great a discretion as by too great a confidence
1	and yet every day she had stoked the stove , cooked and baked , fetched water , chopped wood , slept in the same bed with him , and when he came home drunk from weddings , she reverently hung his fiddle on the wall each time and put him to bed , and all that in silence , with a timid , solicitous look
1	at the door to the chapel , d'artagnan felt his courage abandoning him again
1	he looked around intently and was surprised that he had come there
1	besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier dounia is with him
1	it was learned later , through mme de chevreuse , who told it to two or three of her lovers , that he had taken holy orders in a monastery in nancy
1	the old man still did not understand and smiled still more good-naturedly in anticipation
1	yes , yes , i know
1	milady thus continued on her way , and the same day that planchet embarked for france at portsmouth , his eminence 's messenger triumphantly entered port
1	i cried to him
1	if you want , you may also stay with him , said the prince , there will be room enough
1	the steps sounded very far off , at the very bottom of the stairs , but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming there , to the fourth floor , to the old woman
1	he saw a water nymph swim from behind the sedge ; her back and leg flashed , round , lithe , made all of a shining and quivering
1	he touched up his horse and , calling to him the column leader miloradovich , gave him the order to advance
1	let me not have any happiness either in this world or in the next !
1	he 's an intelligent man , though ; he has this bon sens , a sober , practical understanding of things
1	once they had passed , there again came the same soldiers , with the same talk , and finally everybody stopped
1	d'artagnan profited from the lamp burning in the ferryman 's hut to reread mme bonacieux 's note once again and assure himself that he was not mistaken , that the rendezvous was indeed at saint-cloud and not somewhere else , in front of m d'estrées 's pavilion and not in some other street
1	in that case , general , you saw nothing in the same spirit , dumas refers to the manuscript of the memoirs of m le comte de la fère , which he claims in his preface to be reproducing in the three musketeers
1	boulogne , the evening of the th
1	see where god granted us to meet again , said the small man
1	he would glance away , then look at me again , and suddenly he began to smile at me
1	how he beat her , how he dragged her !
1	the young man in the fox fur coat stood in a submissive pose , stooping slightly , his hands clasped together over his stomach
1	remember , he spent the night with us at otradnoe
1	you wo not understand it , but i swear to god that i could not control myself any longer , something was happening to me , i could not restrain myself , i told my husband i was ill and came here
1	the ship , too , has a senseless and cruel expression
1	it was indeed hot and stifling , and it would have done no harm to go for a swim
1	she spoke it in a quick patter , blushing , and wanted to leave quickly , because she also awfully disliked smearing feelings around , and in this respect was just like me , that is , shy and chaste ; besides , naturally , she would not have wanted to start on the theme of makar ivanovich with me ; what we could say by exchanging looks was enough
1	but we shall meet again
1	you know that yourself
1	for you will soon have to be off
1	what beauty will save the world ?
1	in translators ' notes a notebook entry for september , dostoevsky settled the problem of the lapse between the events and the time of writing
1	however , you are falling asleep , and it 's time i did , too
1	i have served for twenty-three years , never did any wrong ; release me , for god 's sake
1	well , it 's all one and without adding another sound , he turned , walked out , and went down the stairs without even deigning to look at the landlady , who was obviously waiting for explanations and news
1	they accused one another , fought and killed each other
1	that evening weyrother had gone twice to inspect the enemy lines in person and twice to the emperors , russian and austrian , to report and explain , and then to his office , where he had dictated the german disposition
1	but isn ’ t the sense of self-preservation enough ?
1	please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible
1	and i will tell you this , prince andrei interrupted him with calm power in his voice
1	on the contrary , you will have to answer , gentlemen , for violently obstructing the course of justice
1	and and you ca not ?
1	in his situation , he ought first of all to address himself to the office of public order , not because it was related directly to the police , but because its procedures were likely to be much quicker than elsewhere ; to seek satisfaction from the authorities in the place where the nose claimed to work would be unreasonable , because it could be seen from the nose 's own replies that nothing was sacred for this man , and he could be lying in this case just as he lied when he insisted that he never saw him before
1	such a state unsettled his health , and his most terrible torment was that sleep finally began to desert him entirely
1	several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway
1	but this time do not say a word to alyona ivanovna , her husband interrupted ; that 's my advice , but come round to us without asking
1	and there was something else here as well , too awful and disturbing
1	compassionate and , so to say , commiserating these people , i am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me !
1	i say , but i am drunk , assez causé , he said
1	the fences were sturdy and new ; under a shed stood two fire hoses and a barrel painted green ; the paths were straight , the bridges strong , with handrails
1	no , such luck is not to be , thought rostov , and yet what would it cost ?
1	well , hang it , brother , what stuff i am talking , it 's bedtime !
1	svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant
1	province , on the estate of the landowner belokurov , a young man who got up very early , went about in a vest , drank beer in the evenings , and kept complaining to me that he met with no sympathy anywhere or from anyone
1	that 's my farewell message
1	excuse me , are you mr
1	a right to crime ?
1	he surprised me , asking whether i remembered the triple goal of the order : ( ) keeping and knowing the mystery ; ( ) purifying and correcting oneself for the receiving of it ; and ( ) correcting the human race through striving for this purification
1	he turned to look at his wife
1	oh , i at once understood , even then , that in many ways i would never understand them ; to me , a modern russian progressive and vile petersburger , it seemed insoluble , for instance , that they , while knowing so much , did not have our science
1	of course , the funeral !
1	he had not told her of it , because princess marya would have asked their father to give his consent , and without achieving that goal , would have irritated their father and brought upon herself the whole burden of his displeasure
1	yes , it 's time , said dyudya , getting up
1	which means that kolya is either there or in pavlovsk with the epanchins
1	it 's an expensive gun
1	she asked versilov 's advice at first , but soon she chose vasin as her adviser and helper , as i was surprised to learn later she went to see vasin every day , also went to the courts , to the prince 's superiors , went to the lawyers , the prosecutor , in the end she spent almost whole days away from home
1	what ’ s more , poor ivan fyodorovich , who happened to be present at the interrogation , spoiled things completely with his answer
1	princess marya sat alone in her room , vainly trying to overcome her inner excitement
1	seeing natasha , he waved his arms desperately and broke into painfully convulsive gasps , which disfigured his round , soft face
1	so the third fell on you from the sky ?
1	prince andrei looked at her sternly
1	d'artagnan shouted to him
1	i had never expected that
1	she turned away and then , as if fearing that rostov might take her words for a wish to move him to pity her , gave him a questioningly frightened glance
1	the prisoner said that the troops that had just entered fominskoe were the vanguard of the whole big army , that napoleon was there , that the whole army had already left moscow five days ago
1	again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart , and again for an instant softened it
1	yes , i was well , then it is a precedent for you for the future— though do not suppose i should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime !
1	i also got up
1	you will see it 's as good as any other
1	my father , however , was a second lieutenant in the army , from the junkers
1	the room was dark , especially on the sofa where they were sitting , but the silver light of the full moon fell on the floor through the big windows
1	but indirectly , only indirectly !
1	she had only one day left : lord de winter had announced that she would be embarking on the twenty-third , and they had just reached the morning of the twenty-second
1	on the contrary , sire , m de tréville replied calmly , i have come to ask you for justice
1	then explain immediately what you think about it
1	d'artagnan , stranger as he still was to court manners , found a certain coolness in this reception
1	anatole went to kiss the little princess 's hand
1	that 's not at all the thing
1	the tip of the sock was soaked with blood ; he must have unwarily stepped into that pool but what am i to do with this now ?
1	cried milady , throwing herself at his feet
1	natasha put it into her braid
1	sometimes i see him in my dreams : he takes part in my doings , we are both very interested , and yet i remember and am fully aware , throughout the whole dream , that my brother is dead and buried
1	i ate dinner , even ate too much , so as to have the right to stay as long as possible , and sat there , i think , for some four hours
1	there 's no use , he said , he 's dead
1	he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming
1	but you are young , and i give you my blessing
1	a professor who had once taken part in such battles himself , on entering the classroom , would know at once from his students ' flushed faces that it had been a fine battle , and while he gave the rhetorics a knuckle-rapping , in another class another professor would be applying the wooden slats to the hands of philosophy
1	word of honor , as i am a gentleman !
1	that evening marya dmitrievna went to the arkharovs and suggested that the girls come with her
1	and yet i am certain that man will never renounce real suffering , that is , destruction and chaos
1	pierre did not take his eyes off him , not missing the slightest movement
1	he takes it so lightly , thought pierre
1	said natasha , when they came out on the high road
1	but pseldonymov obviously could not imagine anything
1	young collegiate registrars , provincial and collegiate secretaries stroll about for a very long time ; but the old collegiate registrars , titular councillors , and court councillors mostly stay home , either because they are married folk or because their food is very well prepared by their live-in german cooks
1	if you do not love me , you would better kill me !
1	that 's the veritable truth , he said
1	ganya again gave him a mocking look
1	he seemed not to use his own strength in this
1	even raskolnikov listened attentively for some time , though he did not talk
1	a far cry from social usefulness and humane endeavors !
1	let me look at you
1	in the month and a half since anna pavlovna 's soirée , followed by the sleepless , agitated night in which he decided that marriage to hélène would be a misfortune and that he must avoid her and go away , pierre , after this decision , did not move out of prince vassily 's house , and felt with horror that in people 's eyes he was becoming more and more bound to her every day , that he simply could not go back to his former view of her , nor could he tear himself away from her , that it would be terrible , but that he would have to bind his fate to hers
1	please consider , it 's nothing to me ; but governmental considerations , governmental considerations require it : you have violated the rules of proper order !
1	he closed his eyes , bowed , and , à la française , without saying good-bye , trying not to be noticed , left the room
1	suddenly on the road going up the opposite heights appeared troops in blue coats and artillery
1	do not trouble , please , it 's only that he is on his travels again
1	i accepted the challenge at once , but i decided that before our encounter i would send him a letter in which i would explain my view of my act , and all my regret for this terrible mistake because it was only a mistake—an unfortunate , fatal mistake !
1	but my own , my own !
1	i am not saying that french books are talented , and intelligent , and noble
1	do not weep , mother , dry your eyes !
1	he stopped and did not finish his speech
1	besides , the doctor might declare that the illness was feigned , and milady , having lost the first hand , did not want to lose the second
1	children of the sun , children of their sun—oh , how beautiful they were !
1	'if i said something unnecessary , still there 's the fact that i am a merchant of the first guild , superior to you—you ought to keep quiet
1	oh , if you knew what an intrigue they have got there now !
1	she found her very plain , affected , and dry
1	well , brother , to make a long story short , i was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality , but pashenka won the day
1	good … well , good day !
1	the matter ’ s clear , it speaks for itself !
1	for if a man is guilty , you must be able to get something substantial out of him ; one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed
1	otherwise , for all the insensitive caricature of the whole , some sharp impulse would have burst through in them
1	and you , sasha , write to us from moscow !
1	came from a third place , abruptly , sharply , as if in vexation ,
1	and the travelers continued on their way
1	without wiping her tears , she turned her eyes , tear-flooded , spiteful , crossed with anger , on the old man ; her face and neck were red and strained , because she was shouting with all her might
1	i know you disliked me from the first and indeed you have no reason to like me
1	is it true , is it true that you were found unconscious in the freezing cold ?
1	the door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor , consumptive woman
1	all was regular and in order ; the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine , and indeed it could have proved nothing else
1	it 's a rich man 's life
1	and by the way , not long ago you spoke of katerina nikolaevna quite hostilely
1	the enemy could already be seen ahead
1	'and how was that ?
1	well , well , all right !
1	only now , at the sight of his dread superiors , did tushin realize in all its horror his guilt and disgrace at having remained alive while losing two guns
1	well , of course , you were young then , inexperienced , but now everything might go differently
1	danilo whistled softly , and at his whistle the trusty lad came running
1	you know , we love each other !
1	why are you hiding your hand from me ?
1	once again he looked at the address on the sealed letter : oh , there was no doubt or anxiety for him here , because he trusted her ; something else troubled him in this letter : he did not trust gavrila ardalionovich
1	he mistook the impulsiveness of his desires for their strength
1	my goal is to conquer this many-headed hydra
1	i tell you this simply to warn you , because i sincerely wish for your good dounia did not reply
1	this third time velchaninov was ready to swear that the gentleman in the mourning hat recognized him and strained toward him , drawn back and pushed by the crowd ; it seemed he even dared to reach out his hand to him ; perhaps he even cried out and called him by name
1	maybe i will come here leave me , but do not leave them
1	what if they know it and are only pretending , mocking me while i am laid up , and then they will come in and tell me that it 's been discovered long ago and that they have only what am i to do now ?
1	he muttered unintelligibly , suddenly laughing somehow strangely
1	but why not now ?
1	the old woman recovered herself , and her visitor 's resolute tone evidently restored her confidence
1	but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything
1	and how could i have imagined her different ?
1	the comte de rochefort !
1	no , i only meant to say that a handsome mule sometimes looks as good as a horse , and it seems to me that in procuring you a handsome mule for mousqueton let it be a handsome mule , said porthos
1	bagration shouted to him from above not to go beyond the brook , but rostov pretended not to hear his words , and , without stopping , rode further and further on , constantly making mistakes , taking bushes for trees and hollows for people , and constantly explaining his mistakes to himself
1	his desire for murder flared up in him again and invaded him like a burning fever : he stood up in his turn , brought his hand to his belt , drew a pistol , and cocked it
1	he is without any religion , but is almost ready to die for something indefinite , which he can not even name , but which he passionately believes in , after the manner of a multitude of russian-european civilizers of the petersburg period of russian history
1	and before him stood the danube , bright noonday , bullrushes , the russian camp , and he , a young general , without a wrinkle on his face , brisk , cheerful , red-cheeked , goes into potemkin 's decorated tent , and a burning feeling of envy of the favorite , as strong now as it was then , stirs him
1	he recalled the strange way in which this woman had been involved in his destiny up to then
1	but now they are not here and
1	je trouve que c'est charmant , [ ] he said of a diplomatic paper sent to vienna together with the austrian standards taken by wittgenstein , le hero de pétropol [ ] ( as he was known in petersburg )
1	semyon , an old man of about sixty , lean and toothless , but broad-shouldered and still healthy-looking , was drunk ; he would have gone to bed long ago , but he had a bottle in his pocket , and he was afraid the fellows in the hut might ask him for vodka
1	i sometimes speak too much from the heart , so that dounia finds fault with me but , dear me , what a cupboard he lives in !
1	the adjutant of the emperor of russia is a officers are nothing when they have no power : this one has none the austrians let themselves be fooled in the crossing of the bridge of vienna , you are letting yourself be fooled by one of the emperor 's adjutants
1	you feel you are a human being
1	yes , here you sit
1	no one looked at the subject from that point of view then , but that 's the truly humane point of view , i assure you
1	and indeed gogol 's art , despite its romantic ghosts and folkloric trappings , is strikingly modern in two ways : first , his works are free verbal creations , based on their own premises rather than on the conventions of ninteenth-century fiction ; and , second , they are highly theatrical in presentation , concentrated on figures and gestures , constructed in a way that , while admitting any amount of digression , precludes the social and psychological analysis of classical realism
1	besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier dounia is with him
1	only ilya andreich was pleased with pierre 's speech , as he had been pleased with the speech of the naval officer , the senator , and generally always with the speech he had heard last
1	i order you to advance and account to me for what you are doing here at this hour
1	his tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone
1	i gave away all the money you sent me to his wife for the funeral
1	let them , it 's nothing !
1	as soon as she got the money , she would turn and leave at once
1	ah well , then stay , of course do not worry , mama , i am not going to be rude to andrei petrovich anymore , i said abruptly ah , lord , how magnanimous on his part !
1	take yourself up there
1	perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions , but he did not think of that
1	he slept in a warm room , in a soft bed , covered by a fine , fresh sheet and a blanket , but for some reason he did not feel comfortable ; perhaps it was because the doctor and von taunitz spent a long time talking in the neighboring room , and above the ceiling and in the stove the blizzard made the same noise as in the zemstvo cottage , and howled just as pitifully :
1	it 's in the corner to the left , toward the door , in the cupboard , light a candle
1	maybe … maybe we should tie her up ?
1	and since even to this day i hold the conviction that in games of chance , given a complete calmness of character , which preserves all the subtlety of intelligence and calculation , it is impossible not to overcome the crudeness of blind luck and win—so , naturally , i had to grow more and more vexed , seeing that at every moment i failed to sustain my character and got carried away like a perfect little brat
1	does he have even a drop of respect for you ?
1	i have come to say good-bye to him forever
1	i confess , even many years later i suffered from remorse : why , for what reason , had i given him this blow ?
1	because , since i am her father , after all
1	protect me , she cried to the official
1	there he drank a bottle of champagne , which till then he had also known more from hearsay
1	well , we ’ ve yet to see whether we understand or not , ganya muttered mysteriously , only all the same i wouldn ’ t want her to find out about the old man
1	and princess marya tried and was unable to be cordial with the new guest
1	everyone laughed not at marya dmitrievna 's reply , but at the inconceivable boldness and adroitness of this girl , who was both smart and pert enough to treat marya dmitrievna that way
1	what were the causes ?
1	i ’ m unaccustomed to it
1	how could he not understand ?
1	thank you , dear heart , you rescued me , tushin said to him
1	you know those women 's gloves ( he meant the masonic gloves which were given to a newly initiated brother to be presented to a beloved woman )
1	anisim bowed to the ground in front of varvara
1	once when it was already quite dark , we began to pester a girl who was walking quickly and timidly down the boulevard , a very young girl , maybe only sixteen or even less , dressed very neatly and modestly , who maybe lived by her own labor and was going home from work to her old mother , a poor widow with children ; however , there 's no need to fall into sentimentality
1	but the evening was not to end without its curiosity , and versilov did manage to astonish me greatly
1	rare is the bird that flies to the middle of the dnieper !
1	ah , by heaven , athos picked up , you are asking too much , d'artagnan !
1	pierre had left his house only so as to be rid of the complicated tangle of life 's demands which had taken hold of him , and which he , in the state he was in then , had been unable to disentangle
1	to comfort her , the pink coverlet and the pillows in pink cases were moved to the drawing room
1	later , it 's true , his wife would come , lamenting that her husband had been drunk and had asked too little ; but a ten-kopeck piece would be added , and the deal was in the hat
1	i was like an outcast and had been placed with other people almost from birth
1	with this formal , heartless attitude towards the person , a judge needs only one thing to deprive an innocent man of all his property rights and sentence him to hard labor : time
1	you do not want to serve me ?
1	[ ] having repeated these words , the captain rubbed his eyes and shook himself , as if to drive away the weakness that came over him at this touching memory
1	we wo not hold out , stepan nikiforovich said suddenly , after slight reflection
1	the latter was at home in his garret , busily writing at the moment , and he opened the door himself
1	they both went up to the window , and through a slat in the blind they saw m bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak
1	the first preserve the world and people it , the second move the world and lead it to its goal
1	you can rest easy , he said brusquely while sealing a letter
1	i see that village now as in a dream , i even forget my nanny
1	he also wrote separate works on a number of figures , including isabel of bavaria ( ) and the countess of salisbury ( )
1	then you will not leave here , he said
1	the post turned out to be in the house of old prince sokolsky
1	with sad and timid eyes he looked for her ; she returned and stood by his pillow
1	by my will alone i have unquestionably just raised and lowered my arm
1	my god , help me and strengthen me so that i may walk in thy paths
1	princess marya looked at him with astonishment
1	hand it in , since it seems he did not finish and smiled a painfully false smile
1	you may laugh at me , but my mother is here , he turned suddenly to porfiry , and if she knew , he turned again hurriedly to razumihin , carefully making his voice tremble , that the watch was lost , she would be in despair !
1	but that is what the scoffers do not understand : he had a dream , they say , a delirium , a hallucination
1	the unknown man saw then that things had gone beyond raillery , drew his sword , saluted his adversary , and put himself gravely on guard
1	but what do i want with her ?
1	gruel with gravy is also good
1	he went into that room—the fourth in order ; it was a small room and packed full of people , rather better dressed than in the outer rooms
1	really , perhaps i am
1	have you produced many famous scientists ?
1	just what you need !
1	maybe because in general i dined with them rarely , certain special additions had even been made : sardines appeared as an entrée , and so on
1	it is the desolate time of holy saturday , when christ is buried , the disciples are scattered and — worse than that — abandoned
1	he quickly asked her something and , not waiting for an answer , led the prince further through the rooms
1	nor my own children …
1	lizaveta prokofyevna , how can you , for pity ’ s sake ?
1	he bent down with the candle and saw a little girl , not more than five years old , shivering and crying , with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel
1	suddenly he stopped as if rooted outside the doors of one house ; before his eyes an inexplicable phenomenon occurred : a carriage stopped at the entrance ; the door opened ; a gentleman in a uniform jumped out , hunching over , and ran up the stairs
1	it 's you , it 's you !
1	i ask you , sir , not to be clever and try to dodge with me !
1	he stopped in front of me
1	what 's it all about ?
1	something twitched in her face
1	hah … very odd , sir !
1	it was growing dark and cool
1	i likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to‐morrow morning by business in the senate that does not admit of delay , and also that i may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son , and avdotya romanovna her brother
1	and so it goes till dawn
1	people with kulichi and bundles huddled together among the tombstones and crosses
1	while the skiff advanced with all the strength of its four rowers , felton untied the rope and then the handkerchief that bound milady 's hands
1	if his eminence will cite me some examples of these events in history , said milady , perhaps i will be able share his confidence in the future
1	( a century later , in his little book on gogol , vladimir nabokov , though no disciple of belinsky , offered a similarly rationalizing reduction of gogol 's work , rejecting all the fantastic tales as juvenilia and allowing as the real gogol only the overcoat , the inspector general , and the first part of dead souls
1	five minutes is all , i was only five minutes late !
1	who knows , i may need to leave by a back door
1	bound hand and foot with graveclothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin
1	where she 's gone and when she will be back
1	in manner he was slow and , as it were , nonchalant , and at the same time studiously free and easy ; he made efforts to conceal his self‐importance , but it was apparent at every instant
1	of course i did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his whole story
1	the girl was not totally silent , however ; she did let slip in her vague replies that she used to love her father more than her mama , because formerly her father had always loved her more , and her mama formerly had loved her less ; but that when her mama was dying , she had kissed her a lot and wept , when everyone left the room and the two of them remained alone
1	he was visibly triumphant , he looked at me merrily , as if he had found me out and caught me at something in the slyest manner
1	have not you noticed it ?
1	oh stupid , ungrateful children !
1	i did it on purpose , and she , i thought , had to be given time
1	and i knew that thou hearest me always ; but because of the people which stand by i said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me
1	but let us also leave that for a moment
1	ivan fyodorovich , if you please , centaury or caraway flavored , which do you prefer ?
1	the old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys , and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room
1	only the money we would reckoned was not enough , not nearly enough
1	she was a piteous and unseemly spectacle , as she ran , weeping and panting for breath
1	this livtsov—he even sincerely started a friendship with golubenko , was reconciled with him completely , and moreover , sir—got himself invited to be best man , held the crown , and once they came back from church , went up to congratulate and kiss golubenko , and in front of the whole noble company , in front of the governor , in a tailcoat and curled hair himself , sir—he up and stabbed him in the gut with a knife—golubenko went
1	his future i can picture clearly
1	the chum was dumbfounded
1	neither army falls apart , but immediately after the confrontation , the russian army retreats of necessity , just as a ball rebounds of necessity after colliding with another ball coming towards it at a greater speed ; and also of necessity ( though losing all its force in the collision ) the swiftly rolling ball of the invasion rolls on for a certain distance
1	when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand , he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid
1	mother , you are quite pale , do not distress yourself , darling , said dounia caressing her , then with flashing eyes she added : he ought to be happy at seeing you , and you are tormenting yourself so
1	the then still-living chief l -- -- -- -ko himself had summoned him specially to poltava to paint the wooden fence around his house
1	his malice was aimed at himself ; with shame and contempt he recollected his cowardice
1	and if they do not strike one as sharply as attila or stenka razin , it is precisely because they occur too frequently , they are too ordinary , too familiar a sight
1	there is misery enough without that
1	now i do not have visitors every day
1	he asked for a samovar and some hay for the horses and , having had his tea , went to bed
1	ganya muttered , noisily shutting the window
1	what made you put it secretly in her pocket ?
1	strange that he had almost forgotten that face and remembered it only now
1	one would have thought the cellar was home to one of those scraggy ogres , gigantic heroes of popular legend , whose cave no one could force with impunity
1	the three musketeers but the wine , asked d'artagnan , who furnishes the wine ?
1	he bent his back , the tomfool , grabbed her bare legs with both hands , and went galloping like a horse all over the fields
1	he had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering
1	what do you think about the story chalais 's equerry tells ?
1	alpatych came to yaroslavl with business reports , and with suggestions and advice to move to moscow , to the house on vzdvizhenka , which had remained intact and only needed minor repairs
1	i say , balaga , said anatole , placing his hands on the man 's shoulders , do you love me , or not ?
1	i would even ask you to , you see but the possibility , above all—the possibility alone of supposing that you love katerina nikolaevna !
1	the general frowned , turned away , and walked on
1	but the next day no news came from the army , and the general voice became anxious
1	it is obvious that the explanations of power by these historians , mutually refuting each other in this fashion , can be fit only for children of the most tender age
1	because they multiply like rabbits
1	i have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments , and i am besides a titular counsellor in rank
1	he has only one day left to live , and tomorrow he will bid the world farewell
1	he was clearly upset that pierre had no parents , especially no mother
1	she whispered rapidly , forcibly , glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes , and squeezing his hand
1	michaud , who had never seen moscow before the campaign and who did not know russian , all the same felt deeply moved when he appeared before notre très gracieux souverain ( as he wrote ) with news of the moscow fire , dont les flammes éclairaient sa route
1	having let in the light and forgetting the burning candle on the table , he began pacing back and forth still with some heavy and sick feeling
1	you must admit that , if on the very same day and hour ear‐rings from the old woman 's box have come into nikolay 's hands , they must have come there somehow
1	remember how we and nikolenka , the three of us , talked in the sitting room—remember , after supper ?
1	he understood what she was weeping about , but in his soul he could not suddenly agree with her that something he had lived with since childhood and considered most ordinary—was bad
1	i was waiting for a chapter two certain person , on whose arrival in petersburg i could definitively learn the truth ; in that lay my last hope
1	no , i did not know ; who is marfa petrovna ?
1	that morning , that is , when i got out of bed after the relapse of my illness , he came to see me , and then i learned from him for the first time about their agreement concerning mama and makar ivanovich ; he also observed that , though the old man felt better , the doctor would not answer positively for him
1	the so-coveted coffer contained eight hundred thousand livres
1	the doctor was very offended ( proving what he was by that alone ) , yet he continued to visit
1	and i put a new tire on the front wheel of your kibitka then !
1	it sometimes happens that i spend whole hours sitting silently , making gambling calculations in my mind and dreaming of how it will all go , how i will stake and win
1	their whole destiny is involved ; it 's sixty or eighty thousand
1	it was probably she , as the most educated person in the house , who had been charged with meeting and receiving the doctor , because she at once began hastily explaining the causes of the illness in minute , nagging detail , but without saying who was ill or what was the matter
1	they laid upon me the duty of rhetor
1	all his things , and whatever else there was—easel , canvases , paintings—were transported to the magnificent apartment that same evening
1	they really do not like it !
1	the wind plays in the rigging , the propeller thuds , the waves splash , the cots creak , but the ear is long accustomed to it all , and it seems as if everything around is asleep and still
1	sasha started going to school
1	seeing pierre , he angrily muttered something and went to the corridor
1	as for the key , it had disappeared
1	a sword , sir , is honor , came the general 's cry , but that was the last i heard of him
1	the assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately
1	trouble , trouble , mon cher , he said to pierre , these girls are trouble when their mother 's not around
1	oh , but i , said felton , i do not fear him , and i will not spare him !
1	my dear d'artagnan , said athos , you will never be more than a very bad author !
1	not only since the previous day 's meeting with kutuzov on pok-lonnaya hill , but ever since the battle of borodino , when all the generals who came to moscow said with one voice that it was still impossible to offer battle , and when , with the count 's permission , government property was being evacuated every night and half the inhabitants had left , count rastopchin had known that moscow would be abandoned
1	the flat underneath the old woman 's was apparently empty also ; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off— they had gone away !
1	other ideas crept into his mind
1	be that as it may , it is at least certain that the clerk lived in a better part of town-—meaning not very near to akaky akakievich
1	did you really think i was such a scoundrel ?
1	yes , is there a family without its grief ?
1	pierre walked the whole length of the corridor to the stairway and , wincing and rubbing his forehead with both hands , went down to the first-floor landing
1	he drew attention to the bullets that constantly shrieked , sang , and whistled around them
1	she added , quite unaware of the naïvety of the question
1	i wanted to have a talk with him , and i know for certain that in ten minutes he would have started asking my forgiveness ; but i reasoned that it was better not to touch him
1	je suis tout à vous
1	beside him on a little table , within his reach , lay three or four books and a pair of silver spectacles
1	but if he 's an ignoble man ?
1	now and then he glanced at the familiar crowd around him , then again at his feet
1	i will make peace only when not a single armed enemy remains on my soil , he said
1	generally , she lives in grand style : she has rented an expensive separate summer house with a big garden and moved all her town furniture into it ; keeps two maids , a coachman i often ask her :
1	the old count 's hospitality and good-nature , which struck one especially nicely in petersburg , was such that prince andrei could not refuse to stay for dinner
1	at every step he was pulled up short by want of knowledge of the most basic elements ; a simple , insignificant mechanism chilled his whole impulse and stood as an insuperable threshold for his imagination
1	but a small blue flame still clung from below to one corner of the lower log
1	they would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat , while they were going upstairs
1	dymov , with a naive and good-natured smile , gave ryabovsky his hand and said :
1	andrei yefimych was touched by this genuine concern and by the tears that suddenly glistened on the postmaster 's cheeks
1	i met with sincerity in you
1	if it 's a sin , it 's a sin , but i would rather be struck down by lightning than live such a life
1	and mother wants to teach me french , for it 's time my education began
1	neither the sleepy , lackluster eyes nor the falsely profound look was there : his round , firm , hawk 's eyes looked straight ahead with rapture and a certain disdain , apparently not resting on anything , though his movements were as slow and measured as before
1	he went on , taking the clay mug from the cossack
1	was a bit glum and as if preoccupied as they all went out for a walk
1	but then he did push to the front and looked at his clothes , wishing to straighten them properly
1	zossimov watched him intently
1	the latter slightly shook his head
1	but i always loved mama , loved her then , too , and did not really hate her , but it was what always happens : the one you love most is the first one you insult
1	as he went out , svidrigaïlov ran up against razumihin in the doorway
1	i had already thought that up when i was in the sixth class in high school , and though i quickly became convinced beyond doubt that it was stupid , all the same i did not stop being stupid at once
1	flew out of his mouth
1	what then is sin , the concept of which follows from the consciousness of man 's freedom ?
1	the messenger , without a single word of response , bowed , took the letter and the order for two hundred pistoles , and left
1	and i ran after katerina nikolaevna
1	for carts that deliver bread to all mankind , without any moral foundations for their action , may quite cold-bloodedly exclude a considerable part of mankind from enjoying what they deliver , as has already happened …
1	besides , certain men were writing books at that time
1	there was love among them , and children were born , but i never observed in them any impulses of that cruel sensuality that overtakes almost everyone on our earth , each and every one , and is the only source of almost all the sins of our mankind
1	it was obvious to him that all this did not concern him , that he was not called upon and therefore could not judge about all that
1	wait , let 's do better , montaran , let 's each take a half
1	le roi de prusse !
1	she ran to the attic
1	he had made nearly sixty leagues in twelve hours
1	some fools to want that !
1	are you ill or not ?
1	she and i already talked about it
1	i have brought you a study
1	anna mikhailovna came to the countess 's room on tiptoe with the letter and paused
1	see , he dumps money on the table , the boor !
1	they noticed ( though i did not ) that after his fit a sort of special inclination developed in him to get married quickly , and that he supposedly set about this idea more than once in that year and a half
1	neither for the french nor for the russians did it make the slightest sense
1	he wo not be worth much if he does , answered dounia , sharply and contemptuously
1	good lord , what a misfortune !
1	velchaninov studied him with loathing and uneasiness
1	so you see , berg said to his comrade , whom he called his friend only because he knew that all people had friends
1	and open up the sky before him on the other side over the church , and have all the angels in the heavenly light come flying to meet him
1	besides , i ’ m a very vindictive man , and that ’ s also because i ’ m not witty
1	i have heard from depraved people that very often , when a man comes together with a woman , he starts in complete silence , which , of course , is the height of monstrosity and nausea ; nevertheless , versilov , even if he had wanted to , would have been unable to start in any other way with my mother
1	he thought he was being dragged into one of those fantastic intrigues such as are fulfilled in dreams
1	remember my words , you will see !
1	she did not say a single word , but only handed me the paper and ran back
1	she spent the night weeping over him and in the morning she brought the child
1	i summoned you precisely to invite you to accompany me on the march to nastasya filippovna , or , better , on the march against nastasya filippovna !
1	a few moments later , crowds of wounded and stretchers came back from there
1	then she threw herself on her knees and began to pray
1	to run away from home !
1	one can tell it by your tone
1	everything in him was stirred , and he could think of nothing but oksana
1	the general is always at lebedev ’ s ; he also left just now … lebedev may come to see you presently ; he ’ s been looking for you , i don ’ t know why , he asked twice
1	a few minutes later , the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to him :
1	when i heard all that i did not say a word to anyone'— that 's dushkin 's tale—'but i found out what i could about the murder , and went home feeling as suspicious as ever
1	she said softly and turned away to hide her tears
1	yes , he is a swindler
1	but for you i will add eggs , and that is a grave infraction of the rule , for eggs are meat , since they engender the chicken
1	there , in that huge , brightly lit hall , where duport , with bare legs and a sparkling jacket , had leaped over the wet boards to the music , and girls , and old men , and the bare hélène , with her calm and proud smile , had rapturously shouted bravo—there , in the shadow of this hélène , everything had been clear and simple ; but now , alone with herself , it was incomprehensible
1	the prince noticed ( he now noticed everything quickly and greedily , perhaps even what was not there at all ) that evgeny pavlovich ’ s civilian dress produced a general and extraordinarily strong impression , so much so that all other impressions were forgotten for a time and wiped away
1	the gates creaked and they went into the yard
1	she thought in moments of total darkening
1	the three musketeers m bonacieux lived on quite peacefully , perfectly unaware of what had become of his wife and hardly worrying about it
1	a couple of words , prince , i forgot to tell you , what with all these … doings
1	take it , said milady , putting a pouch full of gold into felton 's hand
1	observed zametov , yes , that 's quite possible
1	the moon makes her face look pale , stern , and fantastic , as if made of marble
1	he was in a woman 's dress , with tousled hair and a happy smile that was new for sonya
1	judging by his calm , intelligent eyes , which have a bright and cheerful look , he keeps his own counsel and has some very important and pleasant secret
1	and after that they cry that they are humiliated and demand equality ; what kind of equality is it , if she tramples me down or stuffs my mouth full of sand !
1	her daughter-in-law , nadya 's mother , nina ivanovna , blond , tightly corseted , in a pince-nez , and with diamonds on every finger ; and father andrei , an old man , lean , toothless , and with a look as if he were about to say something very funny ; and his son , andrei andreich , nadya 's fiancé , stout and handsome , with wavy hair , resembling an actor or an artist—all three were talking about hypnotism
1	yet one event shook him deeply and awakened all his living constitution
1	her dark eyes flashed , two red spots appeared on her pale cheeks
1	anatole was always content with his position , with himself , and with others
1	one adds a sort of blustery colonel blimp humor that xi a note on the translation corresponds to nothing in the french ; another has the habit of saying elaborately twice what dumas says simply once
1	he lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes
1	what ’ s the law : is it a blasphemy ?
1	however , he by no means lost any of his dignity : wore a high-waisted tailcoat after the fashion of military uniforms , spurs on his boots , and a mustache under his nose , because otherwise the noblemen might have thought he had served in the infantry , which he sometimes scornfully called infantury and sometimes infantary
1	he could never understand and explain to himself why , when he was tired and worn out , when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way , he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go
1	and a very fine one at that , he said , i saw it yesterday , your friend 's valet was holding it
1	as for the other one , he knows me , he fears me , and he knows what to expect of me if i ever escape from his hands
1	however , we are wrong to have begun talking about civil servants ; in fact , we wanted to talk about practical people
1	by the end of the year , having made sure that i was able to endure any fast you like , i began to eat as they did and went back to having dinner with them
1	there is as much to be had again if you are back here in six days and if you have properly carried out my commission
1	these facts made an impression in his favour
1	well , if someone said to me right now , this minute : do you want to remain the way you were before captivity , or live through it all over again ?
1	he glanced at the paper once more
1	just look at me , the pretty little coquette went on , how smooth my step is ; my shirt is embroidered with red silk
1	danilo put on his astrakhan hat , closed the window , latched the door , locked it , and quietly went out through the yard , between his sleeping cossacks , into the hills
1	where did you come from ?
1	then her hair , under her knowing hands , took on successively the waves she believed would contribute to the charms of her face
1	the spina scapulae in the back
1	i know i am not well , without your telling me , though i do not know what 's wrong ; i believe i am five times as strong as you are
1	everything kept collapsing , and there 's horror to come ( nb
1	but i was terribly struck that this son should so easily , that is , i mean to say , so publicly reveal the secret of his birth and , above all , disgrace his mother
1	suddenly she heard a tapping on the windowpane , and , in a flash of lightning , she saw a man 's face appear beyond the bars
1	only the distant noise of a carriage was heard , and paramon 's coughing , and nevyrazimov 's sadness and spite grew stronger and more unbearable
1	the birds were chirruping under the window , and in the middle of the room , on a table covered with a white satin shroud , stood a coffin
1	the thought of dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart
1	the queen rushed to a little table where she found ink , paper , and pens
1	there is no answer , of course
1	shall i tell them or not ?
1	the affair between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up , and , despite the sovereign 's severity concerning duels , neither the two adversaries nor their seconds suffered
1	she called , shaking the door
1	a knife , which she would hand back to me through the peephole a minute after receiving it , replied felton
1	silence was now setting in , and several sleepers could be heard snoring ; the others turned and warmed themselves , occasionally exchanging words
1	well , that 's exactly how it was with me : though i was pretending , i wept quite sincerely
1	i at once began to make peace between them , went to see the tenant , a very coarse , pockmarked fool , an extremely vain clerk who served in a bank , chervyakov , whom i myself disliked very much , but with whom , anyhow , i got along well , because i often had the baseness to join him in teasing pyotr ippolitovich
1	now it 's time the illness ended , she said
1	the happy state of mind of the officers after the review passed itself on to the soldiers
1	the blonde greeted him as an acquaintance
1	yes , yes , definitely , cried petya , blushing almost to the point of tears and glancing at denisov
1	he was now riding beside ilyin between the birches , occasionally pulling leaves off the branches that happened in his way , occasionally touching the horse 's flank with his foot , occasionally handing his finished pipe , without turning around , to the hussar behind him— all with such a calm and carefree air as though he was just out for a ride
1	sweat streamed from ivan ivanovich and ivan nikiforovich
1	anna mikhailovna sat down beside him , took her handkerchief , wiped the tears from his eyes , the letter stained by them , and her own tears , read the letter , reassured the count , and decided that she would prepare the countess over dinner and before tea , and after tea would announce everything , with god 's help
1	indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with razumihin
1	she called the deaf man
1	fields spread out to the left from the edge of the village ; they were visible as far as the horizon , and across the whole breadth of those fields , flooded with moonlight , there was also no movement or sound
1	i ca not prove anything to you
1	when kolya finished , he quickly handed the newspaper to the prince and , without saying a word , rushed to a corner , huddled tightly into it , and covered his face with his hands
1	abroad there , once , in a joking moment , she indeed told the prince amaybe , in the future ; but what could it have signified besides just a light word ?
1	i naturally let him know that his manners were no longer to my liking , but the main thing here came out because of the assistant section chief : this gentleman decided to peach on me for supposedly 'being rude ' to him , though i only told him he was undeveloped
1	the priest bowed his head and said nothing
1	well , what is it to him , pray tell me !
1	what makes me a titular councillor , and why on earth am i a titular councillor ?
1	allow me to observe , he answered dryly , that i do not consider myself a mahomet or a napoleon , nor any personage of that kind , and not being one of them i can not tell you how i should act
1	papa , your dinner is ready , varvara ardalionovna announced , coming into the room
1	i hastened to cry in defiance
1	i know , i know , i understand
1	yes , honor before all !
1	now , some insist that this is indeed the dearest of all things for man ; wanting may , of course , converge with reason , if it wants , especially if this is not abused but is done with moderation ; it is both useful and sometimes even praiseworthy
1	he started some sort of gavotte , knowing that german women need gradualness
1	and her glance—the sun , by god , the sun !
1	i shall be keeping an eye on you , for i shall be there , the cardinal went on , pointing out to d'artagnan the magnificent suit of armor he was to wear , and on our return , we shall make our reckoning !
1	one word from me , one movement of my hand , and this ancient capital des czars is destroyed
1	did not he go to your mother in kônigsberg to ask her permission to marry mme
1	a roast boar with cabbage and plums was served
1	they have , and as your excellency may have seen , his horse is under the main gate , all fitted out for departure
1	and were , perhaps , at least sixty times fatter than the rest of mankind …
1	you try to keep the artists from noticing it , though it 's impossible to hide it and they have all known for a long time
1	at the time of the last supper , you remember , peter said to jesus : ' i am ready to go with you , both into prison and to death
1	i absolutely , absolutely want him to get it back today , the same day—and lump it
1	anna andreevna and mme
1	said the lady , rushing across the room to the wall and aiming her lorgnette at the sketches , set pieces , perspectives , and portraits standing on the floor
1	and athos , like the spectre of vengeance , leaped into the room
1	so king stepan announced that if some brave man could be found who would bring him this pasha dead or alive , he would pay him alone as much as he paid his whole army
1	when the governor 's wife went to mrs malvintsev 's the day after her soirée and , having talked over her plans with the aunt ( mentioning that , though under the circumstances it was impossible even to think of a formal engagement , still the young people could be brought together and given a chance to know each other ) and when , having obtained the aunt 's approval , the governor 's wife spoke of rostov in princess marya 's presence , praising him and telling how he had blushed at the mention of the princess—princess marya experienced not a joyful but a painful feeling : her inner harmony no longer existed , and again there arose desires , doubts , reproaches , and hopes
1	i thought you would just let me stay like that—that 's what she had said then on tuesday !
1	how much gold we brought home then !
1	darya alexeevna even became wrathful
1	morsels do not tempt me : can positions or honors be worth the place i am worth ?
1	on the faces of the french general , officers , and soldiers the former expression of cheerfulness and calm was replaced all at once , as if on command , by the stubborn , concentrated expression of a readiness to fight and suffer
1	rent it to me , the prince suddenly suggested
1	seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses , if false or even mistaken , i should myself in a certain sense be made responsible , i am aware of that
1	we only put on steam
1	it was clear that the one being greeted was riding quickly
1	as soon as boris left , the flushed sonya came from the other door , whispering something spitefully through her tears
1	as if all that was stored up and suppressed in me had only been waiting for this moment to break out
1	a small thing , to cut off a person 's head for no reason at all , and an innocent child 's at that !
1	well , make your choice !
1	i thank you all , gentlemen ( every word rostov heard was like a sound from heaven ) , with all my heart
1	with that i was really and truly branded !
1	and he thought of sonia
1	yes , at first i was thinking , here we are driving along and we think we are driving home , but god knows where we are going in this darkness , and suddenly we will arrive and see that we are not in otradnoe , but in a magic kingdom
1	the doctor wanted to stop her
1	from the windows he saw people coming to be caught ; then , as he had removed some tiles from the floor and dug through the subflooring , and only the simple ceiling separated him from the room the three musketeers below where the interrogations took place , he heard everything that went on between the inquisitors and the accused
1	and , say , have the horses been watered yet ?
1	something must finally be decided on !
1	you would not go to a tavern , of course ?
1	dounia , goodness knows whether he will come !
1	do not call him bad , said natasha
1	but , not to speak only of her , this early and terrible death , despite all our grieving , had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother
1	the fact is , d'artagnan ventured timidly , that i did not see the handkerchief come from m aramis 's pocket
1	we have the poetry in life
1	the countess pressed her friend 's hand
1	i naturally went after her , but she had stopped right at the front door
1	now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering , so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking
1	before i reached home i was summoned to the major ’ s , then i had to pass by my company , so that i got home quite late
1	he sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner ; ordered some beer , and eagerly drank off the first glassful
1	on saturdays and sundays he went to church
1	versilov explained it to me later in more detail
1	cried m de tréville , gazing at d'artagnan
1	it was a fatum
1	what is the difficulty ?
1	ah , my god , he 's choking on a bone !
1	evgeny pavlovich stood on the steps as if thunderstruck
1	he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the body of his mistress
1	it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way , though not much so
1	planchet , d'artagnan said to his servant , who just then stuck his head through the half-open door to try to catch some shreds of the conversation , go downstairs to the landlord , m bonacieux , and tell him to send us a half dozen bottles of beaugency—it 's my favorite wine
1	she knew that if she said a word about it , if she asked petya not to go to this battle ( she knew he was glad of this impending battle ) , he would say something about men , honor , the fatherland—something senseless , masculine , obstinate , against which it would be impossible to object— and the matter would be spoiled , and therefore , hoping to arrange everything so as to leave before then and take petya along as a defender and protector , she said nothing to petya , but summoned the count after dinner and tearfully implored him to take her away quickly , that same night if possible
1	in notes from underground the same evolution is reflected in the mind of one man : the polemicist of the first part grew out of the defeated dreamer of the second
1	i don ’ t think it ’ s nice , however , and , you know , keller , i reproach myself most of all for it
1	i have fallen in love with your brother once and for all , and whatever happens to him , or to me , i will never stop loving him—all my life
1	there was no one to be seen there during the day but beggars eating and children playing
1	indeed , he did stand them to three bottles of his own
1	i heard that too
1	that is , you see , if i had told her directly in so many words : yes , i am taking revenge on society , and she had burst out laughing , as she did that morning , it would in fact have come out ridiculous
1	the maid served tea to the attending doctors and kept running to the pharmacy , and there was no one to put the rooms in order
1	and , pulling down his earflaps , he walked out of the house
1	the other side of the wall was a street
1	i kept telling her i would take her to boulogne to swim in the sea , now , at once , in two weeks , that she had such a cracked little voice , i would heard it that day ; that i would close the shop , sell it to dobronravov , that everything would begin anew , and , above all , to boulogne , to boulogne !
1	i will note another feature : despite the gentleness and simpleheartedness , this face never showed mirth ; even when the prince laughed with all his heart , you still felt as if there was never any genuine , bright , easy mirth in his heart
1	this last consideration gave him pause
1	it was when i was wandering about yesterday , rather delirious , i chanced upon a man who had been run over a clerk delirious ?
1	but the contradictions are not only in arkady 's perception , but in versilov himself
1	he cried , nastasya filippovna !
1	mme bonacieux had the most charming smile in the world
1	i bless you and your destiny let us always be pure in heart , like today kind and beautiful , as far as possible let us love all that 's beautiful in all its various forms well , enfin enfin rendons grace et je te bénis !
1	after the engagement of prince andrei and natasha , pierre , without any obvious reason , suddenly felt the impossibility of going on with his former life
1	and how thin you have grown , how changed
1	the relations of the rostovs and bolkonskys sometimes descended on bald hills by whole families , with their sixteen horses , with dozens of servants , and stayed for months
1	what an odd man you are !
1	pierre tried to get to the wing , but the heat was so intense that he involuntarily swerved around the wing and ended up by the main house , which was burning only on one side of the roof and around which a crowd of frenchmen swarmed
1	i ask about country estates—same answer
1	he had told a lie then , and raskolnikov knew he was lying
1	let me try it on
1	one adjutant , closer to the door , in a persian dressing gown , was sitting at a table and writing
1	i shall read it
1	and , with that good sentiment , he went up to aramis , who was going away without paying any further attention to him , and said : monsieur , you will excuse me , i hope
1	ah , he 's a deep one !
1	having insignificant capital and in view of my growing family , you must agree that an honest percentage …
1	the aunt asked on their way
1	and olga ivanovna listened now to ryabovsky 's voice , now to the silence of the night , and thought she was immortal and would never die
1	and you call that trifles !
1	he had hardly gone ten steps when his ears started ringing , dizziness came over him , a bloody mist passed before his eyes , and he fell down in the middle of the road , still shouting : coward !
1	vasin looked at me questioningly
1	perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family 's arriving ?
1	looking at the self-assured and elegant expressions on the faces gathered here , he kept expecting something especially intelligent
1	but i want to be a brother to her
1	said tanya , and again she wanted to laugh , but the laughter did not come out , and red spots appeared on her face
1	your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier , said prince andrei
1	prince andrei was standing directly in front of kutuzov ; but from the expression in the commander in chief 's one good eye , it was clear that his thoughts and concerns occupied him so greatly that it was as if they interfered with his vision
1	i ’ ll wear it , and you can wear mine , i ’ ll give it to you
1	a ninny , who has lord de winter 's life in his hands and does not kill him , and who costs me three hundred thousand livres in income !
1	they had not yet been sitting for five minutes when suddenly another guest was announced and , as if on purpose , also of a compromising sort
1	d'artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times
1	ivan ivanovich had already managed to visit the farmstead and the mowers outside town to inquire of the muzhiks and women whence , whither , and why , got mighty tired and lay down to rest
1	juicy green leaves without branches broke through the stiff , hundred-year-old bark , and it was impossible to believe that this old fellow had produced them
1	lxiii : a drop of water now , this point was settled : mme bonacieux would follow her unsuspectingly
1	a true graveyard silence fell
1	it seems our grandpa 's gone completely loony , said khobotov , leaving the annex
1	you just called me perfection ; a fine perfection , if just for the sake of boasting that i ’ ve trampled on a million and a princely title , i go off to a thieves ’ den !
1	he did this for many years , till his own death ; it reached the point where he was known over the whole of russia and the whole of siberia , that is , to all the criminals
1	he recalls that she was born while he was still working as a servant for the master of verkhnie zaprudy
1	she stood a moment , looked at him uneasily , and went out troubled
1	did europe resurrect me ?
1	asked nastasya and again received no answer
1	c'est la bataille de poultousk qui est sensée être une grande victoire , mais qui à mon avis ne l'est pas du tout
1	back at athos 's , aramis and porthos asked about the causes of this strange rendezvous ; but d'artagnan contented himself with telling them that m de richelieu had invited him in order to propose that he join his guards with the rank of ensign , and that he had refused
1	he immediately sent in his resignation and , without waiting to be discharged , took a leave and went to moscow
1	you wait , he said behind him , i am not joking , i mean it , come here , come here
1	the three musketeers are above history and above personal involvements
1	one of these parasites , approaching old age , announced on his own and without being forced , that in the course of a long and meager life he had personally killed and eaten in deepest secrecy sixty monks and several lay babies—about six , not more , that is , remarkably few compared with the quantity of clergy he had eaten
1	i do not judge you ; it is not by reason that i have come to consider you perfection ; i simply believe it
1	there 's only one thing left—to go away , but where will i go ?
1	when i dream , i am visited by phantoms
1	and mr lambert confirmed the same thing to them
1	i think it ’ s still in the general ’ s office , on the desk
1	his hair was soaked with sweat , his quivering lips were parched , his eyes were fixed on the ceiling
1	you mean to say he 's deceiving me , you mean to say he 's betraying me ?
1	but at the door she stopped , as if feeling a pang of remorse that , in her gladness , she had left the baby too quickly , and turned to look
1	i am for those who preserve the state , bonacieux said emphatically
1	the only movement in the air was the slow movement from above to below of descending microscopic drops of mist or fog
1	see see what they have brought us to !
1	they were not bought , they were his own gooseberries , the first picked since the bushes were planted
1	but to tell the superintendent to stop stealing , or to dismiss him , or to abolish the useless , parasitic post altogether—is
1	perhaps the cold , or the dampness , or the dark , or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic
1	the number of lights had been intentionally diminished , and yet the young woman could not manage to conceal the traces of the fever that had devoured her for two days
1	i ca not stand that
1	you do not know , liza , what this hangman is for me
1	napoleon gave a start , reflected , and said to me : you have reminded me of the third heart that loves me ; thank you , my friend !
1	follow you at this hour ?
1	the three friends came running and found d'artagnan , not unwell , but dashing for his horse
1	the princess was also preparing provisions for pierre 's trip
1	he 's a special man
1	and he ran out of the room with his hat
1	the officer in the sash got off his horse , called the drummer , and went into the arcade with him
1	history proves that at every step
1	we drove out of town to shoot , and on our way met a birdcatcher with his cages ; lambert bought a canary from him
1	naturally , the carriage was in the foreground , but something else had certainly happened there , something unknown to him and the prince
1	the whole pack changes direction and takes off after a brocket
1	sonya got up , the kitten revived , its eyes sparkled , and it seemed ready to raise its tail any moment , spring up on its soft paws , and play with a ball of yarn , as a kitten ought to do
1	one worthy colonel left home earlier specifically for that and made his way through the crowd with great difficulty ; but to his great indignation , he saw in the shop window , instead of the nose , an ordinary woolen jacket and a lithograph portraying a girl straightening a stocking and a fop with a turned-back waistcoat and a small beard peeping at her from behind a tree—a picture the nose that had been hanging in the same place for over ten years
1	said the joker-singer whom morel was embracing
1	well , would you believe it , my friend , those who have the greatest love of idleness are from the eternally laboring people !
1	well , but if you ca not , then kill me straight out , only do not threaten me and do not torture yourself before me , she concluded , looking at him in strange expectation , as if she really supposed he might kill her
1	what have you done , i ask you ?
1	it was i began raskolnikov
1	maybe the napkin isn ’ t necessary … do they tie a napkin around your neck when you eat , prince ?
1	i suppose you find this uninteresting ?
1	without staying for supper , the rostovs left
1	why has she been setting everyone riddles for three days ?
1	i said to him , 'for my freedom will be your dishonor !
1	why do not they come forward directly and openly , and why is it so necessary that i should go and foist myself on them ?
1	i will read the third
1	as long as histories of separate persons are written—be they caesars , alexanders , or luthers and voltaires—and not the history of all the people , all without a single exception , who participate in an event , it is absolutely impossible to describe the movement of mankind without the concept of a force that makes people direct their activity towards a single goal
1	planchet picked up , astonished
1	quite so , answered razumihin
1	these actions consist in the fact that , instead of a crowd opposing a crowd , people scatter , attack singly , and flee as soon as large forces attack them , then attack again as soon as the opportunity arises
1	afanasy ivanovich , however , often poked fun at this attachment : i do not know what you find in a cat , pulkheria ivanovna
1	at times , finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town , in some wretched eating‐house , sitting alone lost in thought , hardly knowing how he had come there , he suddenly thought of svidrigaïlov
1	pierre took the filled glass and drank it
1	i believe i have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you ?
1	what can he do to harm avdotya romanovna ?
1	he said just as flatly and slowly , and with an obvious effort of recollection
1	why , i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies
1	outside , weeping and shouting could be heard somewhere in the distance , and fire could be seen through the cracks in the shed , but inside the shed it was quiet and dark
1	sonya implored her fearfully
1	by god , i would take the lot of them and give them a good birching !
1	only in our self-confident time of the popularization of knowledge , thanks to that most powerful tool of ignorance—the spread of printing—has the question of freedom of will been reduced to grounds on which the question itself can not exist
1	that ’ s the real truth !
1	and you are what—a doctor ?
1	yet the prince remained dissatisfied with what he had said to rogozhin ; and only now , at this moment of her unexpected appearance , did he understand , perhaps through immediate sensation , what had been lacking in his words to rogozhin
1	when such a one gets violent , even if she leaps beyond all measure , you can still see that she 's only breaking herself , is egging herself on , and that she herself will be the first to be unable to manage her own sense of integrity and shame
1	i have a friend whose last name is samorodov
1	and since you ’ re a completely uneducated man , you ’ d start saving money , and you ’ d sit like your father in this house with his castrates ; perhaps you ’ d adopt their beliefs in the end , and you ’ d love your money so much that you ’ d save up not two but ten million , and you ’ d starve to death on your moneybags , because you ’ re passionate in everything , you carry everything to the point of passion
1	he leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as in a vise
1	in short , his life had already touched upon the age when everything that breathes of impulse shrinks in a man , when a powerful bow has a fainter effect on his soul and no longer twines piercing music around his heart , when the touch of beauty no longer transforms virginal powers into fire and flame , but all the burnt-out feelings become more accessible to the sound of gold , listen more attentively to its alluring music , and little by little allow it imperceptibly to lull them completely
1	nikolenka , what a lovely dog trunila is !
1	kolya led the prince not far away , to liteinaya , to a café and billiard parlor on the ground floor , with an entrance from the street
1	raskolnikov was violently agitated
1	this nasty anecdote occurred precisely at the time when , with such irrepressible force and such touchingly naive enthusiasm , the regeneration of our dear fatherland began , and its valiant sons were all striving toward new destinies and hopes
1	it 's impossible not to admit , prince andrei went on , that napoleon was a great man on the bridge of arcole , and in the jaffa hospital , when he shook hands with the plague victims , [ ] but there are other acts which are hard to justify
1	god , so much happiness in one instant !
1	at bald hills , the estate of prince nikolai andreevich bolkonsky , the arrival of the young prince andrei and the princess was expected any day ; but that expectation did not disrupt the harmonious order in which life went on in the old prince 's house
1	my dear , versilov added to me , i am even glad you have come , so sit in the corner , i beg you , while the baron and i finish here
1	this is the prince ’ s first real moment of reticence in the novel
1	he was surprisingly excited
1	the professor did not go himself , but sent his intern korolev in his place
1	baron , baron chère enfant , je vous aime , the prince wept out , reaching his arms towards anna andreevna
1	once i tried to go down with two of my servants , but he flew into a terrible rage
1	there are powers above his , which do not rest on the caprice of a man or the outcome of an event
1	i see myself that i may have acted very , very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict does the fellow want his head smashed ?
1	totsky and the general exchanged glances once again ; ganya stirred convulsively
1	the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf
1	c'est curieux , ma parole
1	this lovely one , this meek one , this heaven—she was a tyrant , an unbearable tyrant and tormentor of my soul !
1	i ’ d be quite surprised , however , not knowing society ( i admit it ) , that you not only remained in the company of our people tonight , which is quite unsuitable for you , but that you also kept these … girls here to listen to a scandalous affair , though they ’ ve already read it all in novels
1	these results are himself
1	plums , cherries , black cherries , all kinds of vegetables , sunflowers , cucumbers , melons , beans—even a threshing floor and a smithy
1	the englishman stood in front
1	on the table stood vodka , a flask of rum , white bread , and roast mutton with salt
1	oh , that is a proof that the lord is with us , felton , replied milady
1	why waste time talking to him ?
1	i know the serfiss , and i am habituated to strictly fulfilling orders
1	get undressed and go to bed
1	the prince ’ s observation , by its seriousness and simple-heartedness , dispelled the last remnants of his mistrust
1	she jumped up from the sofa at once and fluttered off with him to line up for the quadrille
1	it is solely in that assurance that i have come to you !
1	that 's not it , that 's not what i am asking you , hangman !
1	maybe ( so it seemed to velchaninov ) he was also intelligent : but since natalia vassilievna rather disliked it when her spouse did much talking , his intelligence went largely unnoticed
1	i think only of you all the time , i have lived by my thoughts of you
1	it 's not right for you to spend the night here , sir , said the beadle
1	he had barely ridden out beyond the projecting arm of the forest when he saw a fat gentleman in a visored beaver cap coming towards him on a beautiful black horse , accompanied by two grooms
1	murmured the queen , whose teeth were chattering with fear
1	i want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles , he thought , with an odd smile
1	mack has surrendered and his whole army with him
1	but this is terrible , dymov !
1	but , having learned as unquestionably that his will is subject to laws , he does not and can not believe it
1	† warning to the reader
1	if the purpose was the spreading of ideas , printing would have carried it out far better than soldiers
1	you are the master
1	i saw it myself !
1	i ’ ve seen her twice , only from a distance
1	well , we have turned the corner now , dounia interrupted , and my brother wo not see us
1	the cardinal went to the table , and , without sitting down , wrote a few lines on a parchment that was already two-thirds filled and set his seal to it
1	he bent down over the stone , seized the top of it firmly in both hands , and using all his strength turned it over
1	lambert at once refilled it
1	i see you are tired , because your wounded leg hinders my leg !
1	well , brother , i do not mind that
1	he went to dounia and gently put his arm round her waist
1	i shall be back directly , he shouted to the horror‐stricken mother , and he ran out of the room
1	in his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking
1	cried athos , with an accent like that of a man who sees that he is about to tread on a snake
1	a lot of mourners were packed in there
1	i will call the police !
1	soon an old uniform top with frayed cuffs spread its sleeves in the air and embraced a brocade jacket , after which another stuck itself out , a gentleman 's , with armorial buttons and a moth-eaten collar ; then white twill pantaloons with stains , which had once been pulled onto ivan nikiforovich 's the story of how ivan ivanovich quarreled with ivan nikiforovich legs and now might be pulled onto his fingers
1	to take the hundred pistoles , d'artagnan
1	the appearance of pierre 's nonmilitary figure in a white hat struck these men unpleasantly at first
1	kari , mala , tafa , safi , muter , kaskà , he pattered , trying to give his voice expressive intonations
1	i was a staff-captain then
1	he cried out in despair
1	oh , it was not only the blood of that time that alarmed me so much , and not even the tuileries , but all that was bound to follow
1	why , i have taught you , you know some phrases
1	he held out his hand to me and called me his friend—his friend !
1	he began to see some sort of revolutionary trend in everything , he imagined allusions everywhere
1	andryusha , the elder boy , imitating her , came after her on tiptoe
1	why do not you sit down and rest
1	i but no , i will talk with you later and prince andrei , with a strange gleam in his eyes and with uneasy movements , went over to natasha and sat down beside her
1	he tried , says richelieu in his memoirs , to keep it from them for as long as possible , closing the ports throughout the kingdom , and being very careful that no vessel should leave until buckingham 's army was ready to depart , taking it upon himself , for want of buckingham , to oversee the departure
1	four bullets went through me in four places
1	i asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly
1	what is it , then ?
1	though princess marya , despite her plainness , seemed more attractive to him than julie , he found it awkward , for some reason , to court princess bolkonsky
1	and at eight o'clock this morning'—that was the third day , you understand— ' i saw nikolay coming in , not sober , though not to say very drunk—he could understand what was said to him
1	said d'artagnan , in so firm a tone that it seemed to milady the expression of an unflagging devotion
1	it 's like an assault of voices , an inspired chorus , victorious , overwhelming , something like our 'up-borne-by-the-an-gel-ic-hosts ' —so that everything 's shaken to its foundations , and everything changes into an ecstatic , exultant , universal exclamation— 'hosanna !
1	my calling is different , princess marya thought to herself , my calling is to be happy with a different happiness , the happiness of love and self-sacrifice
1	he remembered you as light ’ ; those were his own words , i heard them from him
1	i also know that i can hate you very much , more than i love you
1	asked the young man
1	demand , demand , demand , and do not ask ! … burdovsky babbled and turned red as a lobster
1	the whole favor consists only in your coming with me
1	with tormentingly strained attention , he peered into everything his eyes lighted upon , he looked at the sky , at the neva
1	my god , but what do i care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if for some reason these laws and two times two is four are not to my liking ?
1	i have put together something like two or three thousand écus of income in the mercery trade , and above all by investing certain sums in the last voyage of the famous navigator jean mocquet , so that , you can understand , monsieur
1	and many whispered among themselves that it was a most ordinary affair , that princes marry all kinds of women , and even take gypsy women from their camps
1	and precisely here , in russia , in our dear fatherland
1	another absolutely insisted on climbing onto the table and delivering a toast , and only the officer , who grabbed him by the coattails , restrained his premature enthusiasm
1	the campaign began , the regiment was moved to poland , the pay was doubled , new officers arrived , new men and horses , and above all that excitedly cheerful mood spread around which accompanies the beginning of war ; and rostov , conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment , gave himself up wholly to the pleasures and interests of military service , though he knew that sooner or later he would have to leave them behind
1	wait here , i will be back at once
1	he was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness
1	none of us got anything then—that is , again , the ones like me
1	anne d'autriche took a step back , so pale one would have thought she was about to die ; and , supporting herself with her left hand on a table that was behind her , to keep from falling , she drew a paper from her bosom with her right hand and held it out to the keeper of the seals
1	only the kindhearted youth who had told about the book of dreams proved good for anything , and inopportunely at that
1	playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that 's for all the world like the old austrian hof­kriegsrath , as far as i can judge of military matters , that is : on paper they would beaten napoleon and taken him prisoner , and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion , but look you , general mack surrendered with all his army , he‐he‐he !
1	they began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him
1	and he began bowing his way out , as if the rest was henceforth up to him
1	as he was riding away from the battery , shots were also heard to the left , in the woods , and as it was too far from the left flank for him to get there in time himself , prince bagration sent zherkov there to tell the senior general , the one who had presented the regiment to kutuzov in braunau , to pull back beyond the ravine as quickly as possible , because the right flank would probably be unable to hold the enemy for long
1	that is , already dead
1	murmured bonacieux , who knew that this was the title usually given to m le cardinal
1	he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday
1	yegor semyonych gave a strained chuckle , blushed , and began repeating the phrases that bashful authors usually say
1	and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face , though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment , for the axe was raised over her face
1	they wo not notice me , and i need a little fresh air , for you have come just in the nick of time—another two minutes and i should have come to blows !
1	for me that is an axiom
1	yet i absolutely had to be done that day with the matter of my salary—before the arrival of certain persons
1	they knew shame , and shame was made into a virtue
1	the great writer was finally forced to give him a whipping , for the satisfaction of his reader ’ s offended moral sense , but , seeing that the great man merely shook himself and , to fortify himself after his ordeal , ate a puff pastry , he spread his arms in amazement and thus left his readers
1	he thought with irritable mockery , stopping at the gate
1	what was it they liked ?
1	no , i am studying , answered the young man , somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed
1	herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter , avdotya romanovna , i beg you to accept the respectful homage of your humble servant , what am i to do now , dmitri prokofitch ?
1	three more shots were heard from the gateway
1	she was thinking of something else
1	this is what it is , she began in haste , as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind
1	where is he now ?
1	three hundred people were then seated in the dining room by rank and importance , the more important closer to the guest of honor , as naturally as water flows deeper where the terrain is lower
1	in pierre 's presence there was always a joyful radiance on his face , and he blushed and became breathless whenever pierre addressed him
1	by way of a fee !
1	you do not believe it then ?
1	the two friends never parted for a moment now
1	then you will have to come up to my place
1	though they whispered and used remote phrases , i guessed it
1	he ne ’ er raised for anyone
1	but , by our holy father the pope , keep it concise , for i am going to pluck you in my turn , i warn you
1	[ ] only schoolboys can have fun like that , prince andrei added in russian , pronouncing the word with a french accent , noticing that zherkov was still within earshot
1	he did not find the official ; he was told that the master has not come back since morning , and is unlikely to come back tonight before three or four o'clock , because he is staying in town for a name-day party
1	it seemed she valued not so much the people as the whole family
1	if that activity displeases someone , it displeases him only because it does not coincide with his limited notion of what the good is
1	so she looks upon you as a stranger ?
1	it is the only thing of father 's left us
1	does her face inspire mere passion ?
1	then said the jews , behold how he loved him !
1	you are a brave man , anyhow !
1	yes , yes that 's clear , it 's all clear now
1	je ne parle pas trop , mais je dis bien
1	to deserve this love a man would be ready to lay down his soul , to face death
1	and he rushed from the apartment , closed the door , and waited outside , the soldier 's half pike in his hand , as if he was mounting guard in his place
1	if i had still had some doubts about my misfortune , those doubts had vanished into a hopeless reality : i was in the power of a man i not only detested , but despised ; of a man capable of anything , and who had already given me a fatal proof of how far he might venture to go
1	it 's clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figure in the business , and no one else
1	down the stone steps he descended , between the charred stumps , to where he had a dugout shelter deep in the ground
1	with feigned astonishment ( a real gascon ) , he turns to auersperg : 'where is that austrian discipline the world praises so much , he says , 'if you allow the lower ranks to speak to you like that
1	he cried , and at the same time , probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them , spurred his horse and rode to the right
1	come sit down , you are tired , i will be bound
1	also waiting for the commander in chief ?
1	there was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk
1	since she 's not left the room , the money would have to be on her !
1	low fires burned nearby , among the french guards , and glimmered far off through the smoke along the russian line
1	raving , raving , there 's where the raving is !
1	pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia , and slightly screwed up her eyes
1	so this is your opinion of pyotr petrovitch ?
1	then i turned at once and quickly sprang away to the opposite corner , so as at least not to see
1	of yours and answer the question : why were you unscrewing the nut ?
1	he could eat a whole portion of selyanka from the pan
1	i helped you , but even so i have to tell you the truth : it 's a dangerous business , and , once you look at it , stupid
1	i quickly closed the door , and the prince , coming in through the other door , noticed nothing
1	but here you sit , guzzling boiled beef as though you would not had a bite for three days
1	i do not know what sadness , sorrow , or boredom is
1	she 's sure to come !
1	forgive my troubling you about such trifles , he went on , a little disconcerted , the things are only worth five roubles , but i prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me , and i must confess that i was alarmed when i heard that 's why you were so much struck when i mentioned to zossimov that porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges !
1	and stands on tiptoe so as at least to see the white cap one more time
1	is trying to get at the seventy-five thousand , is that it ?
1	the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road
1	you need a cure
1	it 's a long time since we have had a bone to pick with the guards of m le cardinal , and m de tréville must think we have died
1	but i can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions
1	she asked him several times about certain details of his trip and seemed to be very interested in the position of the prussian army
1	they all clambered into mikolka 's cart , laughing and making jokes
1	however , i thought it would be more interesting
1	indeed , every day the king asked the cardinal when the fête would take place , and every day the cardinal , under some pretext or other , put off fixing the date
1	he seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape
1	when i came to the office , he called me over and started talking to me like this : well , pray tell me , what are you up to ?
1	i , the vile lebedev , do not believe in the carts that deliver bread to mankind !
1	you are fibbing , my cock‐sparrow !
1	and therefore do not corrupt the youth for nothing
1	such a refutation of your own words , as i have already observed to you , looks like a new confirmation of them , grunted the baron
1	a short , stout man of about thirty , in white trousers , top boots , and nothing but an evidently just-put-on cambric shirt , was standing in this room ; a valet behind him was buttoning on a pair of splendid new silk-embroidered suspenders , which rostov noticed for some reason
1	i sat on the bed and at once found myself an opening in the portière
1	noticing that he was not asleep , she asked :
1	you had begun to pervert my poor felton ; he was already falling under your infernal influence , but i intend to save him
1	he gets up and leaves ; she watches him go : her gaze moves over the tall , skinny figure of her husband and caresses and fondles it
1	your grace , she said in a high little voice , now crying bitterly , mama and all of us were left in such misery
1	prince andrei 's eyes were shut , which made him look tired and sleepy
1	i understand only too well , sir !
1	you have seen the cardinal ?
1	said rastopchin as soon as the man left
1	in a brief outline , he satisfied their curiosity about the wedding
1	i had no time to occupy myself with her upbringing , i observed her only in snatches and therefore can say very little about her childhood
1	the old count rode home
1	andré , pourquoi ne pas m'avoir prévenu ?
1	lambert hurried with the meal , urging the waiter to serve every minute
1	he was even making ready to fight when they should come in
1	there 's something here , thought nikolai and , still more convinced of his conjecture by dolokhov 's departure right after dinner , he called natasha out and asked what it was
1	tomorrow , he said , you will be avenged , or i will be dead
1	while she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle ; dounia , too , put on her things
1	the flabber-gasted ferdyshchenko replied
1	either it 's ill fancy or they know !
1	we might begin it to‐day , we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak
1	pierre was about to reply , but he interrupted him
1	in this case totsky remained true to the good old traditions , changing nothing in them , and showing a boundless respect for the invincible power of sensual influences
1	and he suddenly hurried out of the room , again through the kitchen ( where he had left his fur coat and hat )
1	above all , by proclaiming your illegitimacy , which in itself is a slander , you thereby revealed your mother 's secret and , out of some sort of false pride , dragged your mother to judgment before the first scum to come along
1	he was shaking with rage
1	raskolnikov noticed all this , and he too was uneasy
1	it 's nothing more than a dignity ; it 's not anything visible that you can take in your hands
1	prince andrei said suddenly , clearly wishing to please them
1	the thing is that i want to recall it all now , each trifle , each little feature
1	everyone was silent , and if they spoke , they spoke softly
1	and so , my dear host , do not have any qualms , and go on giving him all the care his condition demands
1	you intend , apparently , to speak in such words tomorrow
1	oh , yes , i also changed the subject , i also tried by all means not to remind her of certain things
1	she won ’ t write to the other one anymore ; she promised ; and she ’ ll leave here tomorrow , as you wished
1	all this , my friend , is a completely worldly thing
1	the triumphant general went on heatedly
1	the lines danced before her eyes , but she knew what she was reading by heart
1	i only remember through my sleep that vasin , having finished his work , put things away neatly , gave my sofa an intent look , undressed , and blew out the candle
1	dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever , razumihin did the same
1	i only wanted to say that your idea of the nobility is at the same time a denial of the nobility , said the prince
1	another obstacle , mme bonacieux murmured woefully
1	no , my dear , i will go , and go straight to the commissar
1	a gentleman clinks glasses with a writ server !
1	the transport was going , on the twenty-second of october , from the village of mikulino to the village of shamshevo
1	they served him dinner
1	and it did look like it
1	some lady may happen to send me out a glass of vodka and a piece of pie , so then i drink to her health
1	she cried out and fell unconscious on his shoulder
1	there his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat
1	why shouldn ’ t he tell a story ?
1	yes , but only to take a small rosewood box with her initial on it and go out at once
1	khobotov shrugged , grinned , and exchanged glances with nikita
1	several times—from terror , no doubt—cold sweat broke out on her burning forehead
1	since then i have gone around every day
1	things have happened there , and there are all sorts of queer people living there
1	hey , matryoshka , the sable one !
1	that 's from another opera , said burkin
1	the three musketeers as long as they were within the camp enclosure , the four friends did not exchange a word
1	athos looked at his watch
1	do you have any money ?
1	during this time , the two young men and the poor lackey had gone downstairs
1	country life has its conveniences , he used to say
1	he is interested , frightened
1	the judge would undoubtedly have done so before anyone else , if he had not entered , meanwhile , into an amusing conversation
1	but the landlady is out of the question ; it 's all right for me , but it 's out of the question for you : she would not take you , for she 's for she 's a fool she would be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you , too , if you want to know of avdotya romanovna certainly
1	cried the prince , beside himself with astonishment
1	i tell you she will trust you for anything
1	he was a most excellent man , you ’ re right about that , ivan petrovich said imposingly and now without a smile , yes , yes … he was a wonderful man !
1	you can tell it all in the street
1	amalia ludwigovna i have you once before told that you to call me amalia ludwigovna may not dare ; i am amalia ivanovna
1	devil knows what this is !
1	well , i ’ m going to leap over all the gymnastics and start straight off with capital ; in fifteen years people will say : there goes ivolgin , the king of the jews
1	how shall i tell you , natasha replied
1	the man ’ s arms and legs are trembling , he ’ s even turning pale , he has a menacing look
1	at last the door opened and sisoy came in , holding a candle and a teacup
1	and the unconcealed , persistent , nervous , and discourteous sarcasm of porfiry seemed strange to razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face
1	the old woman said
1	as solemn peace is higher than all worldly trouble ; as creation is higher than destruction ; as an angel in the pure innocence of his bright soul is higher than all the innumerable powers and proud passions of satan—so is a lofty artistic creation higher than anything that exists in the world
1	piskarev , utterly at a loss , was about to say , and would probably have produced a whole heap of the most incoherent things , but just then a gentleman-in-waiting approached with witty and pleasant observations and a beautifully curled forelock on his head
1	aglaya ivanovna … lebedev began at once
1	he thought finally that the sin might perhaps lie with his overcoat
1	all have forsaken us !
1	the local assessor , the late denis petrovich , always used to say when he saw him in the distance : look , look , there goes the windmill
1	the adjutant generals collected money by subscription
1	in an extensively composed project , toll suggested another plan of campaign—the complete opposite of armfelt 's plan and pfuel 's plan
1	j'ai entendu piailler quelque chose au jardin
1	ce que j'ai vu ces trois mois , est incroyable
1	the worst of it was that he supposedly also hinted it to the father , the husband of the part one unfaithful wife , explaining that the prince was only an amusement
1	nous ne faisons pas la guerre pour le roi de prusse , mais pour les bons principes
1	what do they need ?
1	but with these people prince andrei was able to behave in such a way as to be respected and even feared
1	at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness
1	it is not i ; it is an entirely different person
1	as the child was being baptized , he cried and made such a face as if he anticipated that he would be a titular councillor
1	versilov ran after me
1	when nikolushka was brought to prince andrei , he looked at his father with fear , but did not cry , because no one was crying
1	she finally got up to leave
1	she used to say : 'buy a house , makarych !
1	no , said natasha , though in fact she had also been thinking at the same time about prince andrei and how he would have liked their uncle
1	at last my wretched little wall clock hissed five
1	by eight o'clock in the morning , he was at athos 's place
1	korzh turned to wood , gaping and clinging to the doorpost
1	surely you were appointed for some reason
1	the esteemed mentor said to that
1	they might have known it from varvara ardalionovna , who could and certainly did know everything that ptitsyn knew about the prince and his stay in moscow
1	but i silently took the revolver out of my pocket and put it on the table
1	natasha raised her head , kissed her friend on the lips , and pressed her wet face to her
1	it was the first time in my life that this had happened
1	he ate a little , three or four spoonfuls , without appetite , as it were mechanically
1	mister adjutant , protect us
1	i really do not know what drew me to her then—i think it was because she was always ill if she had been lame or hunchback , i believe i should have liked her better still , he smiled dreamily
1	raskolnikov smiled in reply ; that 's not my fault
1	now , said aramis , you understand , gentlemen , that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours
1	and so , among this household , of whom there were a great many besides makar ivanovich , there was a girl , and she was already about eighteen years old when the fifty-year-old makar dolgoruky suddenly showed the intention of marrying her
1	over a trifle , over a goose
1	anna mikhailovna looked at vera and stopped
1	mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted , he scanned raskolnikov 's low and narrow cabin
1	when i saw the prince again , i felt terribly pained and offended for him
1	and there was always something stuck to his uniform : a wisp of straw or a bit of thread ; moreover , he had a special knack , as he walked in the street , of getting under a window at the precise moment when some sort of trash was being thrown out of it , and , as a result , he was eternally carrying around melon or watermelon rinds and other such rubbish on his hat
1	the old prince turned to prince vassily
1	what do you mean who ?
1	dostoevsky ’ s doubles , which might seem images of personal division , are in fact images of human oneness
1	but , cried bonacieux , this man you are showing me is not d'artagnan !
1	i will be seized , i will be taken to court , i will be thrown out of work , put in prison , sent to siberia , exiled
1	pyotr petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment
1	the old women chased the children away , but they came to the window , sometimes just for a moment , only to say : bonjour , notre bonne marie
1	no doubt , only there 's one problem : my husband was known at the louvre , and they would let him in , while you are not known , and they will shut the door on you
1	the mellow little light still shone through the calm of the night
1	she builds all her hopes on you ; she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it , and we will begin a new splendid life
1	she felt that he had to tell her something , but could not resolve to do it
1	while they were strong , we took no pity on ourselves , but now we can pity them
1	i also remember huge trees near the house , lindens , i think , then strong sunlight sometimes coming through the open windows , a front garden with flowers , a path , and you , mama , i remember clearly only at one moment , when you took me to communion in the church there , and lifted me up to receive the gifts and kiss the chalice ; that was in summer , and a dove flew across under the cupola , from window to window lord !
1	he came running to me with a pale face but never mind him , why bring him in ?
1	he had called on raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery
1	the old woman will stay with you ; and in the front hall and outside cossacks are sleeping !
1	he went through the large room to the front hall , in order to get to the corridor and from there to his room
1	he has a stroke , he 's dying , but you let his blood , you cure him , and he will go around crippled for another ten years , a burden on everyone
1	is your secret at least worth the trouble of my letting you live ?
1	but what are we to think up , andrei petrovich ?
1	no , but you can find me a place in the provinces , with some lady of your acquaintance—where you come from , for instance
1	she has not been out of this room : she came straight from you , you wretch , and sat down beside me , everyone saw her
1	that ’ s the best reply
1	i was mistaken in you !
1	for man sometimes loves suffering terribly much , to the point of passion , and that is a fact
1	why are you backing away from me ?
1	did not i tell you bonaparte was a great tactician ?
1	not a sound came from the stairs
1	six hundred roubles , ace , corner , nine i ca not win it all back !
1	devil take you , i have not slept because of you !
1	i have been all day with sofya semyonovna
1	pierre , barely holding back his sobs , ran towards dolokhov and was about to cross the space separating the barriers when dolokhov cried : to the barrier !
1	the soldiers in my battalion , if you can believe it , refused to drink their vodka : not on such a day , they said
1	he saw before him the face of a quite young , fair‐haired girl—sixteen , perhaps not more than fifteen , years old , pretty little face , but flushed and heavy looking and , as it were , swollen
1	that was five weeks ago , sir
1	he 's lucky he got away from me ; but i will find him , she said in her rough voice
1	it 's time , said yavtukh , let 's go
1	she was almost as beautiful as you are , but she could not laugh the way you do , and her face , which was as attractive as yours—lost its attraction ; but yours is terribly attractive precisely for that ability
1	would it be possible ?
1	how had he found out about her arrival ?
1	the prince did not refuse
1	said porthos , puffing out his chest
1	his bed was made up in this same study , on a soft and also shabby sofa ; he hated this study of his and , it seems , did nothing in it , but preferred to sit idly in the drawing room for hours at a time
1	said dounia laughing , though she , too , was upset
1	that must be how it 's supposed to be !
1	which means the second person comes out as the first person , and the first person as the second person
1	but i saw clearly that the friend had to be prepared , completed , and even won over
1	must be with black eyebrows and eyes big as olives ; and me lying beside her smoking my pipe !
1	you ’ re afraid of a million ?
1	they stared in each other 's faces
1	koch keeps crossing himself and saying : 'if i had been there , he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe
1	well , how did she die ?
1	kovrin was not sleepy , he got to talking with the old man and went back to the gardens with him
1	that question he had never once asked himself today ; here his heart was pure : he knew whom he loved … he was afraid , not so much of the meeting of the two women , not of the strangeness , not of the reason for the meeting , which he did not know , not of its outcome , whatever it might be—he was afraid of nastasya filippovna herself
1	dusk had fallen over the earth , and the roar of the artillery had died down
1	this was athos 's word
1	i walked among them , wringing my hands , and wept over them , but i loved them perhaps still more than before , when there was as yet no suffering on their faces and they were innocent and so beautiful
1	the latter turned round
1	this officer , a very young boy with a broad , red-cheeked face and quick , merry eyes , galloped up to denisov and handed him a wet envelope
1	that 's how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts ; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them , till the last moment , they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong , and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture , yet they wo not face the truth till they are forced to ; the very thought of it makes them shiver ; they thrust the truth away with both hands , until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool 's cap on them with his own hands
1	i can see that you are perhaps more ashamed for me than anyone else , evgeny pavlovich ; you ’ re blushing , that ’ s the sign of a beautiful heart
1	what profit could you make ?
1	raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he was singing , as though everything depended on that
1	and , by-the‐way , are you fond of schiller ?
1	demyan demyanovich , ivan ivanovich said as he finished the last sip , i have come to you on some necessary business
1	as if inadvertently , himself not knowing how , the blacksmith pushed through the crowd and stood next to her
1	she put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest , pressing her other hand to her aching chest
1	her opinion was that part two no one could bear it , because the future would be ruined then , and resurrection into a new life would be impossible
1	i told you to set fire to the bridge , and somebody got it wrong ; everybody 's going crazy there , they ca not figure it out
1	good boy , grigory petrovich !
1	prince vassily 's words frightened her ; her once beautiful face showed spite , but that lasted no more than a moment
1	maybe we should call the priest ?
1	do you remember him clearly ?
1	since then the memory of nakedness has been loathsome to me ; believe me , she was a beauty
1	prince vassily had decided that they had to throw this bone , a promissory note for thirty thousand , to the poor princess , so that she would not take it into her head to talk about prince vassily 's part in the affair of the inlaid portfolio
1	planchet set out after his master and rode ten paces behind him
1	and , quickly opening the door , he stepped resolutely onto the balcony
1	went to the theater
1	my friend , really , it 's better not to wake him , he 's asleep , the princess said in a pleading voice
1	at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall
1	and morally i fear very much for him
1	where shall i go ?
1	the last words were uttered in the passage
1	in an unfinished house on varvarka street , with a pot-house on the ground floor , drunken shouting and singing was heard
1	a cardinal , a papal nuncio , at the levay dew rwah ( do you know what the levay dew rwah was ?
1	you ’ re a perfect child , prince !
1	having finished with his needle , he slowly rose from his seat , slowly moved the chair aside , slowly took off his spectacles , slowly counted the money , and at last , having asked me over his shoulder : should he get a full portion ?
1	indeed , it was planchet and grimaud
1	i ordered my bast-covered kibitka to stop in front of the church and went in so quietly that no one turned around
1	he got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window
1	for a minute i thought it over ; she waited in silence
1	ahead of him he saw our artillerists , some of whom were fighting , while others abandoned the cannon and came running in his direction ; he also saw french infantrymen , who had seized the artillery horses and were turning the cannon
1	we are so different and you know , sonia , it 's only now , only this moment that i understand where i asked you to go with me yesterday !
1	i am not lying , cried dounia , losing her composure
1	i can do the two things at once , he added
1	the old man asked , studying anatole closely and intently
1	as the things would have fetched little in the market , they were looking for a dealer
1	you are selling my bajazet ?
1	whatever wrong i did you , the fault was mine
1	he turned at once to look at pavel pavlovich 's bed
1	and what are you , a soldier ?
1	for two days only the children looked after her , taking turns in coming , but afterwards , when they learned in the village that marie really was dying , the old women of the village began coming in turns to sit by her bedside
1	but she saw that the front doors were locked
1	she will see that i have character and say , ah , he has character !
1	so they brought down the ray of light
1	leave us , my dear , go somewhere , stand in a corner behind a door and have a good cry , remembering your former innocence , and perhaps god will forgive you
1	but i noticed that he put up with my irritability as if he had promised himself beforehand to spare the sick man
1	pavel pavlovich , as usual , was not at home , and he handed the note to marya sysoevna to be passed on
1	they did not suffer for me when sometimes , in tears , i kissed their feet , joyfully knowing at heart with what force of love they would respond to me
1	it 's a pity , brother , that you did not set to work in the right way at first
1	i am unable to submit to a dark power that assumes the shape of a tarantula
1	— and in these penetrating words rang other words : i am your brother
1	but now their hands did not part
1	he thought , feeling the silence of the cemetery and gazing at the clear , serene sky
1	i can speak , and i will say boldly that there are few wives who would not take lovers ( des amants ) with a husband like you , but i did not do that , she said
1	for six months now i have been here without the shadow of a distraction , then you come , your presence would be charming company for me , and here , in all probability , i will be leaving the convent any moment !
1	adelaida tried to ask him who this uncle was who had just been spoken of and what had happened in petersburg
1	pidorka and petrus started living like lord and lady
1	you ’ re not from those same rogozhins … the clerk began with increased importance
1	what a wily person you are !
1	he longed for a drink of cold beer , and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food
1	damn , lieutenant , he said , you are not so bad off to be given commissions like that , especially if milord authorizes you to look till she 's in bed
1	but who poured you the wine that was in this glass ?
1	there were not such big receptions as before , but they maintained the same way of life , for without it the count and countess could not imagine life at all
1	one keeps harping on the same note , like a drum !
1	well , there she goes !
1	i am sure that in less than three days this balm will cure you , and at the end of three days , when you are cured , well , then , monsieur , it will still be a great honor for me to be your man
1	mrs pseldonymov , a courageous and magnanimous woman , undressed him herself , took off all his clothes , looked after him as after her own son , and spent the whole night carrying the necessary vessels from the bedroom to the corridor and back again
1	let 's leave honor out of it ; besides , your answer was bound to be democratic
1	she wanted but did not dare to pray , did not dare to address herself to god in the state of soul she was in
1	your brother went to get it ; it ’ s in the front hall
1	i do not insist , by the way , that she understood it all clearly ; but on the other hand she fully understood that i was a loathsome man and , above all , incapable of loving her
1	the officer almost whispered to the dragoons , and one of the soldiers , his face disfigured by rage , suddenly struck vereshchagin on the head with the flat of his broadsword
1	lizaveta prokofyevna asked with enthusiasm and wrath , and expected an immediate answer
1	what are you glad about ?
1	no , never mind the island of madagascar , she said and , jumping off his back , she went downstairs
1	he suddenly cheered up again , so you are waiting for grisha ?
1	but tatyana pavlovna was the most frightened of all
1	i said through my sobs
1	in her view and understanding , all too much had occurred and been revealed in this incident , so that in her head , despite all the disorder and fear , resolute thoughts were already germinating
1	a fancier and a hunter , he had recently obtained for himself a fine , big , dashing don horse , light chestnut with a white mane and tail , on which no one could outgallop him
1	a crowd had already gathered by the open gates and was looking into the yard
1	it 's as if you had spied and eavesdropped on my innermost thoughts
1	he even surprised them with his special , casual way of dancing
1	a man 's been killed !
1	i will say outright : it was almost impossible to endure it without tears , and not from tender feeling , but from some sort of strange rapture
1	my god , what light !
1	from the moment of the scene with nikolay at porfiry 's he had been suffocating , penned in without hope of escape
1	she says , lowering her voice a whole octave
1	let 's go to the table !
1	go on , i am terribly
1	and if i take such an interest in you , it ’ s because i even have some intention concerning you ; you ’ ll learn what it is later
1	at least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity , as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison
1	she heard his news almost with horror
1	oh , quite the contrary , dear friend , i swear to you !
1	soldiers threw chairs out of the windows of the senate onto the square and built campfires
1	only the russian , even in our time , that is , long before the general summing up , is capable of becoming most russian precisely only when he is most european
1	big circles formed around count rastopchin , valuev , and naryshkin
1	and since she was too chaste , too pure to consent to the kind of love a merchant needs , she did not want to deceive me
1	koch , like an ass , did not stay at the door ; so the murderer popped out and ran down , too ; for he had no other way of escape
1	it seemed he was chapter four practical , and , indeed , several times he gave her advice that appeared good , but all this advice , as if on purpose , turned out to be unfeasible
1	the child fell asleep , and ivan himself began to doze
1	how he is bleeding , she said in despair
1	i was so vexed that i lost my sleep
1	in their bright little eyes i read : go up , thou bald head !
1	rogozhin , who was getting more and more vexed with every word , finally cried out in a sort of frenzy
1	sonia , sonia take his money !
1	i lied about his telling me ; but it was opportune
1	putting his fur coat on in the front hall , he says with a sigh :
1	first , your simple-heartedness alone is pleasant to look at ; it ’ s pleasant to sit and talk with you ; i know that i at least have a virtuous man before me , and second … second …
1	if you ran away , you would come back to yourself
1	he asked his wife , looking past her
1	the appearance of ivan nikiforovich—and , what 's more , in court—seemed so extraordinary that the judge cried out ; the secretary broke off his reading
1	princess marya sighed , and the expression of her face said : yes , that 's what i expected and was afraid of
1	all the best moments of his life suddenly recalled themselves to him at the same time
1	it ’ s a matter of a human life !
1	sickness does not go away easily in such a life
1	when they went into the reception room , everyone was just sitting down to supper
1	crutch got up to go home to the factory
1	i noticed on those evenings that , though he sometimes came in with me , he somehow distanced himself from me during the evening and did not introduce me to any of his people
1	indeed , indeed , who could you have learned it from , sir !
1	perhaps i will bump into something comforting
1	it was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night , yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs
1	granted , granted , i am a scoundrel , but she is a woman of a noble heart , full of sentiments , refined by education
1	her disappointment was too great
1	the devil moaned pitifully
1	if only you knew how furious i have been
1	it 's the well‐known resource—flattery
1	the three musketeers but she was rather perplexed : she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist
1	ii est de très mauvaise humeur , très morose
1	this circle , made up almost exclusively of diplomats , clearly had its own high-society interests , which had nothing in common with war and politics , interests in relations with certain women and in the administrative side of their service
1	i also remember that i was gradually overcome by a rather palpable nervous trembling , which went on for several minutes , and even all the while i was at home and having a talk with versilov
1	they seek truth , they insist on their rights , yet they themselves slander him up and down like heathens in their article
1	he was not unaware that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres ; but in truth the words that had accompanied the gift were beyond price
1	you are mine now , i shall be near you all my life … i shall die soon
1	the young man felt her press his hand and understood that it was with a feeling not of coquetry but of gratitude for his departure
1	art is provincial in principle , preserving for itself a naive , external , astonished and envious outlook
1	i should think so , said zossimov
1	i certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed
1	on bolshoi prospect i will find a cab at once
1	i remember , i remember , of course , and i ’ ll be there
1	it was when i was wandering about yesterday , rather delirious , i chanced upon a man who had been run over a clerk delirious ?
1	oh , i recall very well , the prince replied
1	by heaven , said athos , i have nothing against retreating : we bet on an hour , and we have stayed an hour and a half
1	then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring
1	no , not married , the prince smiled at the naïvety of the barb sent his way
1	he looked repeatedly at the clerk , partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him , obviously anxious to enter into conversation
1	though chernyshevsky is not mentioned by name in notes from underground , his theories , and in particular his novel , are the most immediate targets both of the underground man 's diatribes and of dostoevsky 's subtler , more penetrating parody
1	from the story with rinochka the opposite followed , that no idea can be so intensely fascinating ( for me , at least ) that i can not stop suddenly before some overwhelming fact and sacrifice to it at once all that i had done for the idea during years of toil
1	i flew to prince nikolai ivanovich 's , with a still greater presentiment that the answer was there
1	but does not 'that woman ' also figure on the list of your newer friends ?
1	well , what are you going to do ?
1	i felt very sad
1	but i myself could not leave for anything ; i kept drinking and talking , and i wanted terribly to speak myself out finally
1	as the house is quite orderly , and we do our accounts every week , at the end of eight days we presented him with our bill , but it seems we happened upon the wrong moment , for , at the first word we uttered on the subject , he sent us to all possible devils
1	he whispered at last
1	at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness
1	for the great man there is no bad
1	he suddenly felt so ashamed , so distressed , as he had not felt in the most unbearable moments of his eight-day illness
1	—was how i felt
1	but the countrymen , pressed shoulder to shoulder , catching on their bayonets and never pausing , moved across the bridge in a solid mass
1	seeing his russian face and recognizing him , by the way he walked in and by his first words , as a person of her own circle , she looked at him with her deep and luminous gaze and began to speak in a faltering voice trembling with agitation
1	pavel pavlovich suddenly became terribly animated
1	this pride grew in me over the years , and if it had so happened that i allowed myself to confess to anyone at all that i was ridiculous , i think that same evening i would have blown my head off with a revolver
1	my life has not yet died with that old woman !
1	he served science and died from science
1	he listened silently to the rhetor , feeling from it all that the testing was about to begin
1	buckingham saw , from the expression on the young man 's face , what was going on in his thoughts , and he smiled
1	gusev , did your commander steal ?
1	'one good whack , he says , 'and you will take them all , tikhon concluded , glancing merrily and resolutely into denisov 's eyes
1	if i would spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents , on knick-knacks , dressing‐cases , jewellery , materials , and all that sort of trash from knopp 's and the english shop , my position would have been better and stronger !
1	in a few words , porthos and aramis were let in on the situation
1	astonishing , said ganya , and even with a consciousness of his purpose , he added with a mocking laugh
1	poor pulcheria alexandrovna blurted out , incautiously
1	it was here that i let slip about the portrait …
1	i am betrayed on all sides ; can i trust you ?
1	ebd e‐booksdirectorycom and what if there has been a search already ?
1	denisov , as always , rode out in front of the line , showing off his courage
1	he was very silent himself , sat facing me and , leaning strongly towards me , listened without tearing himself away ; at times he smiled a long , drawn-out smile , baring his teeth and narrowing his eyes , as if making an effort to think and wishing to guess
1	but if he spoke to you , it means you could see him
1	what is your name ?
1	maybe he went out , the caretaker decided
1	awaiting orders , your excellency , to be dispatched to my new assignment , replied boris , showing neither vexation at the prince 's abrupt tone , nor the wish to get into conversation , but so calmly and deferentially that the prince looked at him intently
1	she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck
1	the main thing here is to carry it through to the end—that ’ s the whole task !
1	it 's worth paying for , is not it ?
1	if my benefactor had been here , he would have told me
1	that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to carry out his errand
1	iv : the dinner at dinnertime ivan fyodorovich drove into the village of khortyshche and turned a bit timid as he began to approach the master 's house
1	d'artagnan did not waste time in useless compliments ; he bowed to the governor , thanked him , and left
1	unfortunately , it was a poorly chosen hour for a conciliabule
1	well , enough , enough , velchaninov interrupted him with ever-increasing impatience , as if clearly saying : no point in talking , i know everything you are going to say , and i know with what intention you are saying it !
1	allow me , auntie , to drink with you to samorodov 's health !
1	he cried out slightly , gnashed his teeth , and with his strong hand seized me by the shoulder and spitefully shoved me away , so that i went flying two or three paces
1	coming out to the road , dolokhov did not ride back to the field , but went through the village
1	but the sight of olmütz , where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and both emperors lived with their suites of courtiers and attendants , increased still more his desire to belong to that supreme world
1	but that 's not the main thing
1	but what is it ?
1	yes , said felton , but silence , silence !
1	the prince held to the old fashion of wearing a kaftan and powdering his hair
1	pelageyushka said in horror , turning to princess marya for defense
1	three of my best soldiers , whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotion you have more than once appreciated , and who , i may affirm it to the king , take his service greatly to heart—three of my best soldiers , i say , mm
1	do not jeer at me !
1	said denisov , who had jokingly placed himself on the footing of natasha 's knight in the rostovs ' house
1	i would not give this paper away if they covered it with gold pieces
1	lambert seemed terribly crude to her and aroused her deepest loathing ; but , being prudent , she still accepted his services , which consisted , for instance , in spying
1	the ball was to be attended by the diplomatic corps and the sovereign
1	he was turning to razumihin , but checked himself in time and turned to zossimov again
1	he was still confronted by the question , how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind , since she could not bring herself to jump into the water ?
1	my landlady is a good‐hearted woman , but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons , and not paying her for the last four months , that she does not even send up my dinner and i do not understand this i o u at all
1	why are we staying ?
1	to reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left
1	having ridden down and looked around , denisov nodded to a cossack who was standing next to him
1	the only question is what the meeting in berlin between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia will tell us
1	what 's the sweet fellow doing these days ?
1	it was a warm , rainy autumn day
1	why did he insult me , i ask you ?
1	then d'artagnan stopped knocking and pleaded , with an accent so full of care and of promises , of fright and cajolery , that his voice would have reassured the most fearful person
1	i know that not one of its pale and clerical inhabitants would trade nevsky prospect for anything in the world
1	d'artagnan ground his teeth
1	until then , m bonacieux , until then
1	he stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes
1	there was thus great astonishment and great joy in the regiment when they saw the young man reappear safe and sound
1	they were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this , when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession
1	why , it 's pretty plain
1	it would seem to make no difference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that
1	the two young men hurried to bakaleyev 's , to arrive before luzhin
1	maybe i am terribly depraved
1	by god , it ’ s so !
1	here are two signatures of the german text—in my opinion , the crudest charlatanism ; it discusses the question , 'is woman a human being ?
1	what do you mean ?
1	i never stop loving you
1	but she is an awful old harpy and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was , how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost ; how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on
1	a whole crowd of decent people , clustered together , vied excitedly with each other over something
1	at first i might have thought it was simply her coquetry here—the coquetry of a depraved but witty being , to put on a more costly show
1	( that is , ivan yakovlevich would have liked the one and the other , but he knew it was utterly impossible to ask for two things at the same time , for praskovya osipovna very much disliked such whims )
1	eh bien , si vous ne m'aviez pas dit que vous êtes russe , j'aurai parié que vous êtes parisien
1	why , you are like a child asking for matches !
1	reaching the place , i went into the courtyard indicated on the announcement , and entered mrs lebrecht 's apartment
1	but the intercession seemed to have brought the general to his senses
1	what was his horror now , when he indeed became convinced , by indubitable signs , that he indeed had enemies at the table , and it was no longer possible to doubt it
1	gentlemen , said jussac , with great regret i must inform you that the thing is impossible
1	she got up , went to the table , ate little , and drank only water
1	no , it 's not ; i undoubtedly already knew something , knew even all too much , but how ?
1	and what are they doing ?
1	rostov barely had time to hand him the letter and tell him all about deni-sov 's case before the sound of quick footsteps with spurs was heard from the stairway , and the general , leaving him , moved towards the porch
1	fear is coming over me
1	this strange fact of a bachelor and man of society , who still wished to preserve his gentlemanliness , keeping a single girl as a servant , almost made velchaninov blush , though he was very pleased with this pelageya
1	quite by chance , with the help of my sister , varvara ardalionovna ptitsyn , i obtained from her close friend , vera alexeevna zubkov , a landowner and a widow , a letter from the late nikolai andreevich pavlishchev , written to her from abroad twenty-four years ago
1	intensely unpleasant as it was , he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible
1	the other corner was disproportionately obtuse
1	you mean george villiers ?
1	but a minute later the quadrille was over , and almost at once the very thing took place which ivan ilyich had imagined as he was dreaming on the plank sidewalk
1	i wither from his soft , even voice and bookish language , i grow dumb from his stories
1	papushin was a very rich merchant
1	the shape of the painting is unusual : the narrator describes it as being around six feet wide and no more than ten inches high
1	be quiet , be quiet !
1	he was only dimly conscious of himself now , and the farther he went the worse it was
1	sonya was no less agitated than her friend—both by her fear and grief , and by her own personal thoughts , which she did not tell to anyone
1	he had forgotten the fact so well that he could not even remember the old man 's last name , though all the circumstances of the adventure presented themselves with inconceivable clarity
1	and from the height or that picture , all that used to torment and preoccupy him was suddenly lit up by a cold , white light , without shadows , without perspective , without clear-cut outlines
1	they borrow from the svidrigaïlovs
1	evidence that was no evidence , and that 's what we have to prove
1	he met his visitor with an apparently genial and good‐tempered air , and it was only after a few minutes that raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him , as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret
1	not to mention , said athos , that if he had not taken me out of cahusac 's hands , i would most certainly not have the honor of making my most humble bow before your majesty at this moment
1	we saw each other much later , oh , a long time later , when i went to ask her permission to marry here i will convey the essence of the matter , that is , only what i myself could take in ; and he also began telling me things incoherently
1	but i am giving you an announcement not about a poodle , but about my own nose : which means almost about me myself
1	at last poor akaky akakievich gave up the ghost
1	if he had been more in control of himself then , as he had been up to that moment , he would not have asked me that question about the document ; if he did , it was probably because he was in a frenzy himself
1	it makes no difference
1	oh , for my part i forgive him everything ; you can tell him that
1	he embraced me , stroked my head , called me tender words as if i were a little child
1	but i must be cooler ; i have become too irritable of late
1	to go wrong in one 's own way is better than to go right in someone else 's
1	but you kindly do not beat me !
1	surely versilov , once he 's married my mother , could ask the authorities for permission to adopt me for the father 's services , so to speak
1	of course it 's perfectly natural in your position
1	how pale you ’ ve grown !
1	give me some tea and bring me the papers , the old ones for the last five days , and i will give you something
1	i felt instinctively that someone was approaching me
1	she seemed to be imploring svidrigaïlov ; she had entirely forgotten her fear
1	he gazed at that pale , thin , irregular , angular little face , those soft blue eyes , which could flash with such fire , such stern energy , that little body still shaking with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him more and more strange , almost impossible
1	i merely want to ask you , mr… ippolit … sorry , i ’ ve forgotten your last name
1	ah , the devil find what out ?
1	well , who would have expected to run into a slavophile ?
1	the affair did not work out on account of lydia 's death , and maybe it would not have worked out even if she had remained alive , but even now i do not let mama see the child
1	did i murder the old woman ?
1	understand , prince , that it was a momentary inspiration of his—who , then , informed you of it ?
1	tell her : peace or war !
1	besides , you liked her very much
1	it 's new and untried
1	if i am so scared now , what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were really going to do it ?
1	but it was the end of everything ; he had not the axe !
1	the crackling of this burning straw and its light made the front hall very pleasant on a winter evening , when ardent youths , chilled in the pursuit of some swarthy beauty , came running in clapping their hands
1	all this is to be carried out in order ( le tout se fera avec ordre et méthode ) , sparing as far as possible the troops of the reserve
1	they approached a flooded river , which they had to cross by ferry
1	at nine o'clock , mme la première présidente arrived
1	why , she would give away her last penny !
1	suddenly she rushed and opened the small , old , out-of-tune piano that was in the room , started strumming on it and singing
1	milady saw at a single glance all the suffering she was causing felton by lingering over each detail of her story , but she did not want to spare him any torture
1	i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear
1	neither her father and mother , nor sonya , nor prince andrei himself could have foreseen how parting with her fiancé would affect natasha
1	but there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him , that gradually his attention was riveted upon her , at first reluctantly and , as it were , resentfully , and then more and more intently
1	where the four of us would have been seen conferring together , so that in a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been warned by his spies that we were holding a council
1	in fact , all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her , too much so indeed , in many cases
1	but you have already started , she could not help herself and smiled
1	lida was never tender , she spoke only about serious things ; she lived her own separate life and for her mother and sister was as sacred and slightly mysterious a personage as an admiral who always remains in his cabin is for his sailors
1	take us to the man himself !
1	everything up to a certain limit , and everybody up to a certain limit—you ’ re all the same
1	giving lambert a searching look and figuring that at this point he could get money from him , the man agreed to follow him
1	you were probably silent for a very long time before this
1	these knee breeches and doublet , though new , looked wrinkled , like traveling clothes long shut away in a portmanteau
1	it would be needed only for the study of illnesses as phenomena of nature , not for their treatment
1	i sent her a note , by a maid , at the back door , sir
1	she was truthful and honest , while i—i was a spy , and with documents !
1	that 's true , said the medical student , and he became embarrassed , but anyuta did not manage to tidy up today
1	and you know she fancies it 's very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is !
1	of course it must all be interesting in its way ( ha‐ha‐ha !
1	no need to be nervous , the latter blurted out
1	it was carried on by means of sonia , who wrote every month to the razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity
1	they have a special gift for making these colorless beauties laugh and listen
1	the second , equally essential token is that a petersburg russian never uses the word breakfast , but always says frühstück , putting special emphasis on the früh
1	raskolnikov walked straight to x—— bridge , stood in the middle , and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance
1	not clever , alexandra agreed
1	ivan fyodorovich , hearing that the matter concerned a book , began assiduously serving himself sauce
1	i am no expert at giving mocking nicknames
1	they were approaching ; they were only a flight from him—and suddenly deliverance !
1	the officer presided over all these details with the same calm that milady had constantly seen in him , not uttering a word himself , and making himself obeyed by a gesture of the hand or a note of his whistle
1	rising ever higher and higher , this number , by the fall of , had reached a figure exceeding the population of the year
1	the sheer original does not exist ; we can not escape imitation
1	in church this time the pastor did not heap shame on the dead girl , and anyway there were very few people at the funeral , only some who came out of curiosity
1	i swear it by our god
1	her eyes , fixed upon him , betrayed horror and infinite grief
1	he was gray , remember , and his teeth were white—he stood and looked at us
1	yes , yes though i do not agree with you in everything , added avdotya romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry , for he squeezed her hand so painfully
1	the only ones who say it are always those who have never experimented with anything , never started any life , and went on vegetating with everything provided
1	you will grow so-o-o big , so-o-o-big !
1	but surely you are going to command it yourself ?
1	besides , even if nothing held him up on his way , his intention could no longer be carried out , because more than four hours ago napoleon had ridden from the suburb of dorogomilovo down the arbat to the kremlin , and , in the darkest mood , was now sitting in the tsar 's office in the kremlin palace , issuing detailed , thorough instructions about the measures to be taken immediately to put out the fires , prevent looting , and reassure the inhabitants
1	what do you think , could she have had such a thought ?
1	but along with that he knew that dron , grown rich and therefore hated by the community , was bound to waver between the two camps—the masters and the peasants
1	true , filipp ivanovich potanchikov used to visit me
1	you wrote that you had been insulted by my brother ; i think that this must be explained at once , and you must be reconciled
1	that is not the case at all
1	you know nothing , nothing about it she is so unhappy ah , how unhappy !
1	ones like that , in a shop now , cost only sixteen roubles , the younger one replied to lambert , justifying himself with reluctance
1	it 's odd that even at your father 's funeral you should be so unpunctual
1	i see , he went on , standing up again , i see that everything is against me here , everything and everyone
1	i absolutely want to know this poem
1	suddenly he jumped up , seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom
1	he assured us that this was impossible , that it was all 'cause of a fifteener , and so on , and so forth
1	but they were hardly out of the pothouse when they found themselves staring at the cause of the great commotion
1	a personally honorable citizen and a capable speaker
1	however , you know that , too , sonya
1	he added , looking at raskolnikov 's rags
1	they are all the same , he said to himself , thinking that he was not the only one to have the sad lot of being connected with a vile woman
1	what kind of warrior am i ?
1	he made an effort to look at the servant who never left his post at the head of the bed
1	and tell me , please , what do you find so shameful even in cesspools ?
1	not only did princess marya , won over by his meek attitude towards the wanderers , give him her most luminous looks , but the little one-year-old prince nikolai , as his grandfather called him , smiled at pierre and went to his arms
1	soon after artynov , his excellency came to thank her for taking part in the charity bazaar
1	i might be afraid of the godless man even now , the old man went on with concentration , only the thing is , my friend alexander semyonovich , that i have never once met a godless man , what i have met instead is vain men—that 's how they would better be called
1	he , too , appeared to be in some agitation
1	in that case you may be sure i have taken measures
1	yet my hatred could never ripen and settle in my soul
1	since the day when pierre , leaving the rostovs ' and remembering natasha 's grateful eyes , had looked at the comet that hung in the sky , and had felt that something new had been revealed to him—the question that eternally tormented him about the vanity and folly of all earthly things had stopped presenting itself to him
1	in the diplomatic respect , all napoleon 's arguments about his magnanimity and fairness , both before tutolmin and before yakovlev , who was mostly concerned with acquiring an overcoat and a wagon , proved useless : alexander did not receive these ambassadors or reply to their ambassage
1	when they became wicked , they began to talk of brotherhood and humaneness and understood these ideas
1	these vague expressions seemed quite comprehensible to him , though still too weak
1	this is the moment for consecrating our existence to the king of kings , said d'artagnan , if you insist on doing him a courtesy : non inutile desiderium in oblatione
1	the masters have sent a gig to go to the hospital
1	the horses went like the wind , and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london
1	prince shch , running up to her , finally persuaded her to leave quickly
1	did his majesty not just leave here , and did he not ask you to prepare for this visit ?
1	you did not speak like that just now and i can not be mistaken !
1	the boat pulls in , and from it steps the sorcerer
1	but she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent ; and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing , it betrayed evident uneasiness
1	you earned it—right you are !
1	jussac cried for the third time
1	bilibin came out to meet bolkonsky
1	thought porthos , walking away
1	he turned around , but there was absolutely no one there ; he looked in all directions , peeked into the bushes— no one anywhere
1	she went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water
1	he felt very suspicious of svidrigaïlov
1	the last idea was the most revolting , but he was a sceptic , he was young , abstract , and therefore cruel , and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely
1	so do me the favor
1	nikolenka , what 's the matter with you ?
1	and he actually got it confused : i heard some such story about a stone back in the time of my childhood , only , naturally , it was not the same and was not about that stone
1	at last her restlessness reached an extreme point
1	your mother will add the recipe for a certain balm , which she got from a bohemian woman , and which has the miraculous virtue of healing every wound that does not attain the heart
1	excuse me , prince , what are your orders ?
1	finally , he dreamed he was having a sort of waking delirium and was quite unable to scatter the visions crowding around him , despite the full awareness that it was only delirium and not reality
1	which of us is the madman ?
1	i remember that , sitting and reasoning , i turned all these new questions , which came crowding one after another , even in quite a different direction and invented something quite new
1	i am saying , sire , that these excessive struggles and eternal labors are bad for my health
1	tanya came walking towards him through the park
1	our silence had already lasted some five minutes
1	you see , mother may ask for it before dinner
1	he may die during the night !
1	one 's ashamed to speak of it
1	i had entered that regiment when i came back from abroad , after that meeting abroad with andrei petrovich
1	dounia shook her head
1	said the eldest daughter , alexandra
1	and dull thoughts spoiled his merriment , and he kept thinking that this was not life around him , but scraps of life , fragments , that everything here was accidental , it was impossible to draw any conclusions ; and he even felt sorry for these girls who lived and would end their lives here in this backwoods , in the provinces , far from any cultivated milieu where nothing was accidental , everything made sense , was right , and where every suicide , for example , could be understood and one could explain why and what its significance was in the general course of life
1	i do not think so , he said , although—yes
1	we show you the door
1	wo not he leave dounia in peace even here ?
1	she said , handing the flower back to him
1	he says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance , and yet he lies in bed doing nothing
1	her father had died long ago ; his armchair was lying in the attic , dusty , one leg missing
1	on the contrary , your reasoning is excellent
1	but that was not what louis xiii wanted ; louis xiii wanted a discussion that would yield some sort of light , convinced as he was that the cardinal had some ulterior motive and was contriving some terrible surprise for him , as his eminence knew how to do
1	well , if you remembered something ; that 's all right !
1	at the end of january , princess marya left for moscow , and the count insisted that natasha go with her so as to consult the doctors
1	she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy
1	such mockery of us , the epanchins !
1	besides , porthos ca not owe you much
1	and i went there about a scandalous business
1	however , ukrainian tales levchenko is now sitting at the deacon 's , that i know
1	perhaps there is some misunderstanding here , but , generally speaking , that seems to be so , and our society has been fully just in defining its ideal of the practical man
1	i never thought it was possible for a man who has never wept , for a man of forty-five , not a child , to weep from fear !
1	we are very poor , but i can speak for myself at least : precisely because your father is rich , i do not consider myself his relation , and neither i nor my mother will ever ask for or accept anything from him
1	jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
1	i also suspected that , besides that , he also despised me for yesterday 's scene at dergachev 's ; that was as it should have been : efim was the crowd , efim was the street , and that always bows down only to success
1	in our settlement there 's a cossack named sheptun
1	he 's a political conspirator , there 's not a doubt about it , razumihin decided , as he slowly descended the stairs
1	they do not even take it into account in the way it ought to be taken , and yet the whole account depends on that
1	but the thoughts he read in the book did not satisfy him
1	a cold sweat broke out on the cardinal 's brow
1	the man quickly came back and , taking a large unsealed envelope from his pocket , threw it down on a little table near the prince
1	cheated him , that is
1	he said to her
1	his flight from home , and his kaftan , and his pistol , and his declaration to the rostovs that he would stay in moscow—all this would not only lose its meaning , but would become contemptible and ridiculous ( to which pierre was sensitive ) , if , after all that , he left moscow like everybody else
1	a mace gleamed in his hand ; around him his hired troops ; on both sides stirred a red sea of zaporozhtsy
1	she went strolling alone , in the same beret , with the white spitz ; nobody knew who she was , and they called her simply the lady with the little dog
1	but in spite of that , natasha , now excited , now frightened , her eyes staring , lay for a long time in her mother 's bed that evening
1	and with love one can live even without happiness
1	pierre turned with the same question to prince andrei
1	that 's how it was you attracted my curiosity
1	you absolutely must come and visit us
1	a young , childish sleep was irresistibly coming over him
1	ilya petrovitch held out his hand
1	the greater was his amazement when this same pseldonymov , not more than a week ago , put in a request to get married
1	he had eaten nothing and slept poorly that night , as people close to him said
1	he thought it would be terrible for me
1	marya dmitrievna was known to the tsar 's family , was known to all moscow and all petersburg , and both cities , astonished at her , chuckled secretly at her rudeness and told anecdotes about her ; nevertheless , everyone without exception respected and feared her
1	zakhar , without changing the position of his outstretched arms , raised the hand that held the reins
1	see , he holds it up ( his head , natasha meant )
1	oh , he knows , she went on answering me , but looked as if she had forgotten me and was talking to herself
1	you would better have some tea !
1	she still stood meditating
1	i can not have it anymore , he said and left the room
1	said athos , still in the breach
1	but it seems to me that the only possible happiness is animal happiness , and you want to deprive him of it
1	they all stammer , do not they ?
1	best sort , he muttered , choosing a rhyme , resort
1	he did not know where to put it , racked his brains over it , trembled from fear that it might be stolen from him , and finally seemed to decide to bury it in the ground
1	why should they have called the porter , if it had been their doing ?
1	what orders , your honor ?
1	sits without money and mopes , i replied briefly , burning with curiosity myself
1	so does it matter whether it 's sooner or later ?
1	no , such people , it seems , are not of flesh but of bronze !
1	and so on , and finally , taking her daughter by the hand , she drew her from her husband to her own room , taking upon herself personally the next day 's responsibility before the terrible father when he called for an account
1	till then i had never realized that i loved her
1	but the main thing , the main thing is not in the thought alone , but in the whole situation !
1	his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals , and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her , though he went without his dinner
1	here was a girl of pride , character , virtue , of education and breeding superior to his own ( he felt that ) , and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension , and would humble herself in the dust before him , and he would have absolute , unbounded power over her !
1	and could she see him ?
1	finally , the confession , at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism , and when , moreover , there were no proofs against the real criminal , no suspicions even ( porfiry petrovitch fully kept his word ) —all this did much to soften the sentence
1	for the world of the angels and the souls of all the bodiless beings who dwell above us , natasha prayed
1	why , if i had the slightest suspicion of you , should i have acted like that ?
1	well , what are they getting at me for ?
1	he repeated , now pacing the room , now stretching out on the sofa , and constantly looking at his watch
1	i do not understand the meaning of this strange custom at all
1	grandpa himself , as malasha mentally called kutuzov , sat apart from them in a dark corner behind the stove
1	by those indefinable signs which , even from a distance , unmistakably distinguish a living body from a dead one , napoleon saw from poklonnaya hill the quivering of life in the city and felt , as it were , the breathing of that big and beautiful body
1	nikolai was a simple farmer , did not like innovations , especially the english ones which were becoming fashionable then , laughed at theoretical writings on farming , did not like millworks , expensive products , expensive cereal crops , and generally was not taken up with any specific part of farming
1	pierre was looking at him and had no time to turn away before the old man opened his eyes and fixed his firm and stern gaze directly on pierre 's face
1	if it had not been for something that happened , they would have done so to‐day for certain ; perhaps even now they will arrest me to‐day but that 's no matter , sonia ; they will let me out again for there is not any real proof against me , and there wo not be , i give you my word for it
1	i ’ ll remind you of it tonight …
1	la plèbe , le traître le bien publique , he thought
1	at seven in the morning , he woke up and called planchet , who at the second call opened the door , his face still not properly cleansed of yesterday 's worries
1	in view of this coffin , not only should the money not be taken , but , on the contrary , a deduction should be made from us in your favor !
1	not that i say it in reproach of her !
1	him i know , not personally , but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman
1	you say katerina ivanovna 's mind is unhinged ; your own mind is unhinged , he said after a brief silence
1	i am quite ready to , said d'artagnan , but first i would like to be sure of one thing
1	a peasant woman came into the cottage and began unhurriedly to fire the stove in order to cook supper
1	he went to have a look at the patient
1	yegor semyonych and tanya often quarreled and said unpleasant things to each other
1	but the greatest attention was accorded to totally extraneous events , which had no relation to the battle
1	anna mikhailovna , meek sorrow and all-forgiveness on her face , and the unknown lady stood by the door
1	crowds of wounded and unwounded men of various units , with frightened faces , trudged on the one side back to mozhaisk and on the other side back to valuevo
1	he had not been at mama 's since last evening
1	his face expressed the joy of relief a man feels who intends to rest after an official appearance
1	said d'artagnan , drawing his pistols from his belt
1	do not talk to me like that : i am not worthy of it !
1	it 's better i should know , far better !
1	he drank two bottles of wine by himself
1	quite impossible , to my thinking
1	have not i already done it once ?
1	the cardinal 's , replied mme bonacieux
1	razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs
1	said ivan nikiforovich , too upset himself to know what to do and , contrary to his habit , getting to his feet
1	he shouted , forgetting himself and choking on every word
1	enough , mother , said raskolnikov , deeply regretting that he had come
1	then , finally , there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to himself , and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort
1	but that was not kanev , it was shumsk
1	three silver roubles or two 'paper ones ' as she says that old woman hm
1	it 's spirited of you , it proves you wanted to spare rodion romanovitch
1	learned men now say that genius is akin to madness
1	am i to give my dounia to a man like you ?
1	simply a floating idea
1	and , as she said these words , she actually devoured her with her gaze
1	( she seized him by the shoulder , he got up , looking at her almost bewildered )
1	lose it he does , rogozhin agrees
1	denisov , we are here ! —he 's asleep , he said , leaning his whole body forward , as if hoping by this posture to speed up the movement of the sleigh
1	i will never tell it to anyone , but my god !
1	the dusk turns gray
1	at supper he drank two glasses of champagne—an agent known to have a good effect with regard to gaiety
1	andrei petrovich , speaking here yesterday about nobility , did not say anything new to me , i assure you
1	why should … but i ’ m tired , kolya … besides , it ’ s too sad to start about that again … how is he , though ?
1	cried the astonished cardinal
1	cried luzhin , utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now
1	he said resolutely ; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office
1	however his health seemed unimpaired so far , and looking at his noble , clear‐skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late , pyotr petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and , perhaps , even a better one
1	just as i do
1	you once said that makar ivanovich came to visit you several times , and always stayed in my mother 's apartment ?
1	but i am a most ordinary woman ; i am a calm woman , i like
1	it 's cheap , though i could not , of course , find out so much about it , for i am a stranger in petersburg myself , pyotr petrovitch replied huffily
1	it 's highway robbery , my dear sir , you will answer for it !
1	here you expect an explanation from me , sonia ; you are sitting and waiting for it , i see that
1	how many did we kill ?
1	there were six children
1	that ’ s not how i wanted to put it
1	that , my friend , you must ask the doctor , he said , and , clearly making another effort to be gentle , he said with his lips only ( it was clear that he did not at all think what he was saying ) : merci , chère amie , d'être venue
1	but what if we should all go !
1	outside it was a dark autumn night
1	but what can i do ?
1	i have lost the key and can not find it
1	why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was caught in boulogne , [ ] while later the criminals were the ones he caught ?
1	early on the third day after the murder , when they were still dandling koch and pestryakov—though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff‐an unexpected fact turned up
1	but neither in the one case nor in the other , however we may change our point of view , however we may try to grasp what connection the man finds himself in with the external world , or however inaccessible it seems to us , however much we lengthen or shorten the period of time , however intelligible or unfathomable the causes are for us—we can never imagine either total freedom or total necessity
1	this cause consisted in their numbers
1	i used to carry you about in my arms , sir
1	besides , i am going he paused
1	killing people if i took away the rail or , let 's say , put a log across the tracks , well , then the train might go off , but this
1	there was certainly something of the sort , raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him , goodness knows why
1	do not answer yet , katerina nikolaevna , but listen to everything and then tell me the whole truth
1	i haven ’ t heard it either !
1	nothing 's been tidied up , vassilyich is running his feet off
1	he stopped in mid-speech , lowered his eyes , so as not to see her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face , and said : it 's not at all to quarrel with you that i have come today
1	bring me tea and veal
1	but my brother nikolai ivanych did not lament over it ; he ordered twenty gooseberry bushes , planted them , sat down and began living like a landowner
1	no , it 's decided , everything 's decided
1	and it seems she does not want to know yet
1	it made me ill , but dounia bore it better than i did , and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up !
1	now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes ; it was dark as in a cellar , so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects
1	he said that masonry is the teaching of christianity , freed of state [ ] and religious fetters ; the teaching of equality , brotherhood , and love
1	and your little cottage is choking on something and squealing pitifully
1	petya shook himself , jumped up , took a rouble from his pocket and gave it to likhachev , swung the saber to try it out , and put it in the scabbard
1	as she needed her bile to work , so she also sometimes needed her remaining thinking capacity to work , and the pretext for that was a game of patience
1	the full moon stood high in the bright sky
1	that the prince may marry her you do know ?
1	but he stood in the waiting‐room , and people , who apparently had nothing to do with him , were continually passing to and fro before him
1	as i came in now , i suddenly said , hello , mama , something i had never done before , though somehow this time , too , out of shyness , i still could not force myself to look at her , and sat down at the opposite side of the room
1	he finally had some sort of fit , which resolved itself in sobbing
1	as he passed through , the wind swelled out porthos 's long cloak , and d'artagnan dove straight into it
1	the queen gave them to me ; the queen is taking them back again : her will , like god 's , be done in all things
1	sounds of a struggle were heard , and sonya 's displeased voice :
1	exactly four days ago
1	i was firmly convinced in myself that i would not betray or tell my idea to them ; but they ( that is , again , they or their sort ) might tell me something on their own that would make me disappointed in my idea , even without my mentioning it to them
1	yes , in all likelihood ; but that is too cheerless an idea
1	indeed , dear rodya , the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i can not read it without tears
1	here , from among the folk marveling with fear , one leaped on his horse and , looking wildly around , as if trying to see whether anyone was pursuing him , hastily rode off as fast as his horse could go
1	he was almost beginning to rave something seemed suddenly to go to his head
1	i know what you lack : it 's this !
1	the moment anyone became the least bit famous and was talked about , she made his acquaintance , became his friend that same day , and invited him to her house
1	that 's good , afanasy ivanovich would answer
1	i wo not let you drink !
1	dolokhov said now , as if guessing rostov 's thought , and he smiled
1	all this doubt only gave him a more intense desire to reach some certainty , and he went to his friend with the firm intention of renewing the evening 's conversation ; but he found athos completely sober again—that is , the most subtle and impenetrable of men
1	this incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness , even consternation
1	a quite handsome curly-headed boy with a gaze resembling the gaze of christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing bilboquet
1	his visit the evening before , it will be remembered , had been very brief and not very explicative
1	he had already gone one step , but could not help himself and turned
1	he was not , for the moment , wearing a uniform tabard , which in any case was not absolutely obligatory in that time of lesser freedom but greater independence , but a sky blue jerkin , a bit faded and frayed , and over this garment a magnificent baldric , embroidered in gold , which glittered like the sparkles that scatter over the water in bright sunlight
1	the criminal ends by going and denouncing himself to the clergy , and surrenders to the hands of the authorities
1	prince lev nikolaevich suddenly asked , after a moment ’ s silence
1	she articulated softly and caressingly , as though surprised to find her there
1	or the one who wraps silk around a razor , fixes it tight , sneaks up behind his friend , and cuts his throat like a sheep , as i read recently
1	not one of them has ever poked his nose in here , i have never set eyes on them
1	this new woman announced to him that in the fullest sense it would make no difference to her if he married any woman he liked right then and there , but that she had come to prevent this marriage of his , and to prevent it out of spite , solely because she wanted it that way , and consequently it must be that way—well , so that now i can simply laugh at you to my heart ’ s content , because now i , too , finally feel like laughing
1	but you remember everything !
1	the boy told me to do it
1	and above all , i am getting old , that 's the thing !
1	so , the unknown man said coldly , he 's some prince of the blood in disguise
1	raskolnikov really was almost well , as compared with his condition the day before , but he was still pale , listless , and sombre
1	rochefort , all is not lost , and perhaps
1	it 's hard on me
1	dubasov told me yesterday ; he 's always the first to know such news
1	prove to me that you are my friend , come with me !
1	i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done , for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning
1	not in the least
1	however , it seems the regiment 's not such a bad one eh ?
1	berg , judging by his wife , considered all women weak and stupid
1	young people do not know how to drink anymore , said athos , looking at him with pity , and yet he 's one of the best !
1	the silver cigarette case ; i spoke of it last time , you know
1	but he did not look at them ; he looked fixedly only at what was happening ahead of him—at the battery
1	a handsome man and a drunkard , the number one at the second gun was known in his world as uncle ; tushin looked at him more often than at the others and rejoiced at his every movement
1	with his son , however , he used the diplomacy he made use of on important occasions
1	what could he do ?
1	but no bad conclusions were drawn from her grief
1	but those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys , so that it would be almost ill‐bred in a man of society
1	their characters can best be known by comparison : ivan ivanovich has an extraordinary gift for speaking with extreme pleasantness
1	the stupid woman had never seen a king of spain before
1	you do not know , but they really thought that
1	he needs activity , and this regular , quiet life is ruining him
1	what was to be done ?
1	i ’ m not trying to ferret out anything about gavrila ardalionovich in asking you , observed nina alexandrovna , you must make no mistake on that account
1	why should he be the only exception ?
1	i can not suspect my maid : she was sitting in her kitchen
1	are not you my pretty one !
1	pierre stopped laughing , got up , went further away from the curious fellow , and looked around
1	he stood for some time on the steps , looking gloomily at raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging
1	monsieur knows this horse ?
1	rushing to the conclusion that amalia ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent , she began treating her with extreme nonchalance , which the latter promptly observed and resented
1	how do you know it ?
1	but no matter , he will turn up
1	not yet , wait a little : you said this evening
1	after the twentieth of each month we send him fifty roubles—that mainly serves as the theme of our conversation
1	and a magnificent one !
1	i explained the way myself , told you where it was , and the hours you could find me here
1	besides , it does not matter , they still know nothing , he thought , and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric
1	how did i come to that ?
1	how do you mean ?
1	i will finish my letter tomorrow
1	among them stood a man in a bloody white shirt
1	all my misfortunes come of having said more or less what you have just said before a woman who i believed was my friend and who betrayed me
1	there 's no hurry , there 's no hurry , it 's all nonsense
1	as he was slowly walking down the path with his usual unconcern , having no thoughts at all , a strange incident occurred with him
1	sit down , dear boy , you must be tired ; i see you are
1	it 's written here 'campany , that 's a thing to remember , that letter a , and to look at it again in a month—how shall i look at it then ?
1	till now no one has found out who she 's in love with : i am the first to discover it
1	( at the wishes of liza and prince andrei , they had sent to moscow in due time for an accoucheur , and he was expected at any moment )
1	fortunately that did not happen
1	i forgot to ask you ; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman ?
1	so pierre reflected , and accustomed as he was to it , this whole general , universally acknowledged lie amazed him each time like something new
1	wake up , sonya , she said almost with tears in her voice
1	the three stopped at once , drew close together , and waited , keeping to the middle of the way
1	he cried in a sudden spasm of agony , let me be !
1	the prince gave a start
1	i interrupted with vexation
1	allow me to say , auntie—is not that the storchenko i became acquainted with at the posting station ?
1	i came out proud , but crushed in spirit
1	you miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence !
1	alexandra picked it up , adelaida came over to her , and they both began to study it
1	mlekopitaev , a titular councillor
1	you are begging for some favor on my part , he asked , pondering , and being terribly insistent—i find that suspicious ; i want to know more
1	prince andrei cried in a high , squeaky voice
1	listen , what would you say to becoming an ensign in my guards , and to commanding a company after the campaign ?
1	it was all only a dream , from the horror of that time … i began to study then ; i wouldn ’ t have come back here for three years …
1	kutuzov listened to the report of the general on duty ( the main subject of which was a critique of the position at tsarevo-zaimishche ) in the same way as he had listened to denisov , in the same way as he had listened , seven years earlier , to the debate at the austerlitz council of war
1	but put some writer or foolish peasant woman in jupiter 's place—oh , what thunder , what thunder there will be !
1	my dear rodion romanovitch , excuse me !
1	je crois que non , replied the officer , feeling himself all over , mais je l'ai manqué belle cette fois-ci
1	tikhon went and told him
1	get in , all of you !
1	let him come in then , let him come in !
1	before , when he was still sitting at home , in anguish , he had imagined a thousand times how he would enter his office
1	asked the gascon , proud to show off so rich a present before the eyes of his friends
1	never mind , never mind , replied rostov
1	these are with cloves and walnuts !
1	and of whom shall i now ask forgiveness ?
1	he was standing , hat and gloves in hand , but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases
1	he looked : dolokhov was standing on the windowsill , his face pale and merry
1	and where is she to get raspberries for you ?
1	the little princess , like an old warhorse hearing the sound of trumpets , was preparing herself , unconsciously and forgetting her condition , for her habitual coquettish gallop , without any second thoughts or struggles , but with naïve , light-minded merriment
1	she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to‐morrow for the service , and then to be present at the funeral lunch
1	qu'on emmène cet homme , [ ] the french officer said quickly and energetically , taking the arm of pierre , whom he had just promoted to frenchman for saving his life , and going into the house with him
1	but all the same you ought to go to the reception room , he observed as insistently as possible
1	incredible as it might seem , on the third day after the quarrel , mrs epanchin sent him a footman with a note asking him to come without fail ; kolya did not put on airs and went at once
1	do you know , i fancied i keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination
1	now , let 's reckon up how much we have in all
1	so i have had my sleep
1	the church is quiet
1	but there were far , far too many other insoluble circumstances that had come together that morning , all at the same time , and all demanding immediate resolution , so that the prince felt very sad
1	he had brought me here to explain , to recount , to justify something to me ; and yet everything was already explained and justified before any words
1	only , please , when i am entertaining the guests , said vera , do not interrupt me , because i know how to entertain each of them and what to say in all kinds of company
1	she fell into an armchair , crossing her arms , lowering her head , and expecting every moment to see a judge come in to interrogate her
1	andrey semyonovitch was an anæmic , scrofulous little man , with strangely flaxen mutton‐chop whiskers of which he was very proud
1	as you like , it 's nothing to me , but i wo not come with you ; here we are at home
1	the thaw and the fog persisted ; at a distance of forty paces they could not see each other clearly
1	she must have passed this way , he added with a terrible smile , for i see a dead body !
1	karl ivanych always says that sleep is best of all , princess marya whispered with a sigh
1	learning now that andrei yefimych was destitute , that he had nothing to live on , he suddenly wept for some reason and embraced his friend
1	and how do you know whether i wanted to save anyone then ?
1	here , too , is an abyss ; here , too , is a forty-five-degree slope , down which you can not help sliding , and something invincibly challenges you to pull the trigger
1	and there 's pomatum , too , you see , she must have things ; petticoats , starched ones , shoes , too , real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle
1	and i kept thinking and i had dreams all the time , strange dreams of all sorts , no need to describe !
1	i never have liked water , he thought , even in a landscape , and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea : surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter , but i have become more particular , like an animal that picks out a special place for such an occasion
1	i am very glad , really very glad , that my brother has distinguished himself
1	and how proud they are !
1	i noticed these brooders while i was still in school , and concluded then that it was all because they became envious very early on
1	did i say that ?
1	why is he here ?
1	i , of course , do not have the least right in people ’ s eyes to have any self-love
1	the man stood in the doorway , looked at raskolnikov without speaking , and took a step forward into the room
1	he was very tired and talking as if at random
1	i tell you again , mother , he is still very ill do not you see it ?
1	'oh , in such‐and‐such a place
1	the mystery of death !
1	you see , i am trying on my wedding outfit
1	khoma was again taken to the church in the same way ; again he was left alone , and the door was locked on him
1	how did it happen ?
1	he asked , pointing to the young man
1	in a double sleigh harnessed to two gray trotters that kicked snow back into the dashboard , anatole flashed by with his usual friend makarin
1	even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him , it would not have allayed his uneasiness
1	dolokhov 's back in its white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides
1	one little finger was named pistachio , another vanilla , another raspberry , and so on
1	guffaws , shouts , and ladies ' shrieks were heard
1	letters were sent twice a year , neither more nor less , and they were extremely like one another
1	he took out a notebook , quickly jotted something with a pencil , tore out the page , handed it over , went with quick steps to the window , dropped his body into a chair , and looked around at those who were in the room , as if asking why they were looking at him
1	so flowed the peaceful life of this man who , with a salary of four hundred , was able to content himself with his lot , and so it might have flowed on into extreme old age , had it not been for the various calamities strewn along the path of life , not only of titular , but even of privy , actual , court , and other councillors , even of those who neither give counsel nor take any themselves
1	it can not be , muttered dounia , with white lips
1	pour vos beaux yeux , mon cousin !
1	d'artagnan , mute with wrath and anxiety , sat down , threatening as a judge
1	but she was silent , perhaps waiting for him to speak
1	i never lie , madame
1	they went out ; pavel pavlovich contemplated the dressed-up velchaninov with satisfaction ; it even seemed as if more respect and importance showed in his face
1	so you have seen that man before ?
1	that 's right , said the king , let 's put the case before the judges : it 's their business to judge , and they will judge
1	milady fell backwards and seemed to faint
1	the door was wide open on the stairs ; he could hear exclamations and discussion
1	soon as they make peace , the war with boonapart will open up
1	and yet i wo not look at it as you do
1	he had wanted to go every day and kept being distracted by circumstances … but now he promised himself … without fail … even to —– province … so you know natalia nikitishna ?
1	but maybe you would not have managed to reassure her ; even without you , it seems a lot was seething and smoldering there , vasin remarked in passing
1	on sunday morning , marya dmitrievna invited her guests to the liturgy at her parish of the dormition on mogiltsy
1	i was dying of boredom
1	and why did you also keep silent earlier and not ask ?
1	jesus said unto her , thy brother shall rise again
1	two weeks after the receipt of the letter , in the evening , prince vassily 's people arrived in advance of him , and the next day he himself arrived with his son
1	grandpa , asked lipa , when a man dies , how many days after does his soul wander the earth ?
1	abroad , in yearning and happiness , and , i will add , in the strictest monastic solitude ( this particular information i received later through tatyana pavlovna ) , he suddenly remembered mama—remembered precisely her sunken cheeks—and sent for her at once
1	i kept looking , too … listen , when i came in here earlier and looked at your dear faces—i ’ m very attentive to faces now—and heard your first words , i felt light at heart for the first time since then
1	'and how was that ?
1	and it certainly was a fatum
1	and more about death
1	sofya ivanovna , he went on , addressing sonia , who was very much surprised and already alarmed , immediately after your visit i found that a hundred‐rouble note was missing from my table , in the room of my friend mr lebeziatnikov
1	to each his own , ivan danilych
1	and maybe sonia herself will be bankrupt to‐day , for there is always a risk , hunting big game digging for gold then they would all be without a crust to‐morrow except for my money
1	i ’ m noble , noble , chivalrously noble !
1	i myself ca not tell whether they were dreams or something else— as if some evil spirit was strangling me—and the accursed old man kept appearing in them
1	reading was , of course , a great help – it stirred , delighted , and tormented me
1	go and start a conversation with him : poor , destitute , and wretched , the wife died , there was no money for medicine , and in the winter the baby froze to death ; the older daughter has become a kept woman … he ’ s eternally whimpering , eternally complaining !
1	what a strange note !
1	of that later , but i will note that it was this strangeness of his relations with versilov that struck me in his favor
1	well , how nice , the young man said , laughing , she finds me worth something at least—a hundred louis !
1	yet much , very much , of the essential needed to be defined and clarified , even urgently so , but of those things we did not speak
1	molière had not yet written his play the miser
1	my first impulse , on regaining consciousness , was to look under my pillow for the knife i had been unable to reach
1	my share of the inheritance satisfies stebelkov , but stebelkov says that zhibelsky also has to be satisfied
1	and sonia hastily jumped up from her seat
1	besides , i have something to ask you , general
1	ah , vakula , you are here !
1	i will tell her , when it can be done
1	from nikitskaya , from presnia , from podnovinsky boulevard , several trains like the rostovs ' came together in kudrino , and now two lines of carriages drove down sadovaya
1	we spent the night in the fields , brother , and i woke up early in the morning , everybody was still asleep , and the sun had not even peeked out from behind the forest yet
1	what would have become then of the activity of all those people who opposed the then tendency of the government—an activity which , in the opinion of the historians , was good and useful ?
1	their children were everyone 's children , because they all constituted one family
1	oh , this was too much !
1	you have granted me that awakening ; let me enjoy it at my ease
1	well , but then i took heart
1	and olenka was widowed again
1	she looks around , seeking this power in order to rid herself of it , but she can not find it
1	both passed the examination
1	i ’ ll go to the street , katya , you heard , that ’ s the place for me , or else i ’ ll become a washerwoman !
1	—killed his friend with one blow , like a sheep , and took his watch
1	you are surely not telling us everything ; you surely did something said natasha , and she paused , something good
1	however , he himself did not understand why he found it so especially funny , but the further it went , the funnier it became to him
1	meaning that there 's a big question , sir : about the crape , sir ?
1	yes , that wall of meyer ’ s can tell a lot !
1	that i will become the laughing-stock of all moscow ; that everyone will say that you , in a drunken state , forgetting yourself , challenged to a duel a man of whom you were groundlessly jealous , hélène raised her voice and became more and more inspired , and who is better than you in all respects
1	the meanest and most hateful thing about money is that it even gives one talent
1	several important persons were to be there , who had to be shamed for going to the french theater and inspired with patriotic sentiments
1	was just being hatched in their brains you understand ?
1	not in the least
1	she was wringing her hands
1	so i will write him a letter more or less in these terms let 's hear , said aramis , putting on a critical face beforehand
1	remember thy compassion and mercy from all eternity ; drive us not away from thy face , neither scorn our unworthiness , but have mercy upon us according to thy great mercy and in the abundance of thy compassion regard not our sins and transgressions
1	i will note once and for all that never in my life has casualness suited me , that is , it has never made me look good , but , on the contrary , has always covered me with shame
1	she worked day and night for her sister , and besides doing the cooking and the washing , she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned
1	i appeal particularly to you , honoured pulcheria alexandrovna , on this subject , the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else
1	so carts may quite cold-bloodedly exclude ?
1	still , it 's a pity
1	cried the stupefied musketeer
1	i really do not know what drew me to her then—i think it was because she was always ill if she had been lame or hunchback , i believe i should have liked her better still , he smiled dreamily
1	my name is vrazumihin , at your service ; not razumihin , as i am always called , but vrazumihin , a student and gentleman ; and he is my friend
1	well , i see now , the old woman said , it 's evidently his fate
1	oh , how low i have sunk !
1	it 's hard to describe how good it is to jostle about on such a night with a bunch of laughing and singing girls and lads ready for every joke and prank that a merrily laughing night can inspire
1	the lady did not live with him long
1	what is she doing , then ?
1	and she menacingly pushed her sleeves up still higher
1	well , then , tell him this , rochefort : tell him that our conversation in the inn of the red dovecote was overheard by these four men ; tell him that after he left , one of them came upstairs and tore from me by violence the safe conduct he had given me ; tell him that they warned lord de winter of my crossing to england ; that , this time again , they almost caused the failure of my mission , as they caused the failure of the one with the pendants ; tell him that , of these four men , only two are to be feared— d'artagnan and athos ; tell him that the third , aramis , is mme de chevreuse 's lover : he must be left alive , we know his secret , he may be useful ; as for the fourth , porthos , he 's a fool , a fop , and a ninny , and not even worth bothering with
1	the merry beauty said , turning to one of the girls , you have new booties !
1	maybe we were expecting you
1	moscow has nothing else to do but gossip , he went on
1	the hussars assiduously began lining up their horses
1	he looked extraordinarily sad and weary
1	what are you afraid of , liza ?
1	( ) however accessible the chain of causes of any event , we will never know the entire chain , because it is endless , and again we will never get complete necessity
1	for the street , this is apology enough versilov stopped and suddenly rocked with laughter ; i even thought for a moment that he had gone ahead with this whole story for the fun of it , but that was not so
1	but little folk 's philosophizing does not harm anyone , andrei yefimych said , sounding as if he wanted to weep and awaken pity
1	i can barely see … the bed
1	in those times , too , people loved , envied , sought truth , virtue , were carried away by passions ; there was the same complex mental and moral life , sometimes even more refined than now , among the upper classes
1	trust me in this matter and , believe me , i shall be capable of judging impartially
1	i ca not remember a single new book in which the author does not do his best , from the very first page , to entangle himself in all possible conventions and private deals with his conscience
1	you were all in it together , and i do not know what keeps me from exterminating you all !
1	she did not respond at all to velchaninov 's timid consolations and ardent promises to bring her father to her the next day without fail
1	or-orphans , lebedev began , cringing , but stopped : the prince looked ahead of him distractedly and had quite certainly forgotten his question
1	could it be i was a born gambler ?
1	kutu-zov 's reply to this letter was the same as to the first , sent with lauriston : he said there could be no question of peace
1	but just as the force of gravity , unfathomable in itself but sensed by every man , is only comprehensible to us insofar as we know the law of necessity it is subject to ( from the primitive knowledge that all bodies are heavy , to newton 's law ) , so , too , the force of freedom , unfathomable in itself but of which each of us is conscious , is only comprehensible to us insofar as we know the laws of necessity which it is subject to ( starting from the fact that every man dies and going as far as the knowledge of the most complex economic or historical laws )
1	what would have become of me but for you ?
1	who do you mean ?
1	he writes nothing about his sufferings
1	i know nothing about it , she cried with a heartrending wail , and she ran to katerina ivanovna , who clasped her tightly in her arms , as though she would shelter her from all the world
1	it 's the uniform of the cardinal 's guards ; there 's not an moment to lose !
1	and what cowards they all are here , about having an opinion of their own , you ca not fancy , rodion romanovitch
1	the whole thing , in fact , was perfectly clear
1	i , for instance , am quite unable to reconcile myself to the solemn expression my wife acquires each time gnekker sits down with us , nor can i be reconciled to the bottles of lafite , port , and sherry that are served only for his sake , to give him ocular evidence of the luxury and largesse of our life
1	ebd e‐booksdirectorycom a strange period began for raskolnikov : it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape
1	andreev knocked your hat off , and you gave him twenty-five roubles for it
1	here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes
1	said d'artagnan , who could calculate like archimedes
1	he hastens to prescribe some medicine and waves his arms , so that the peasant mother will quickly take the child away
1	but what if it were the fourth , what if it were the fifteenth , that 's all nonsense !
1	suddenly and quite unexpectedly the ruffled young man in blue spectacles popped from behind a bush
1	but i was afraid to analyze and tried with all my might to divert myself
1	now , when everything ’ s already concluded , i will allow myself to ask just one thing : how could she give you her consent and even present you with her portrait , when you don ’ t love her ?
1	( it was evident that he did not like the viscount and that , though he was not looking at him , his talk was directed against him )
1	by very different means , with opposite tonalities , both stories reveal the infinite value of what is perishing
1	and you know , my dear , my good one—i want to change completely toward him : i want to show him kindness
1	what , is it late ?
1	i have come to see the count with my mother , but it seems he 's not entirely well
1	by the way , my friend , what was it that happened to you last time in front of katerina nikolaevna ?
1	otherwise he will take up one thing or another , turn smart , and then there will be no getting rid of him !
1	but it cost her great effort to do so , because what he said did not interest her at all
1	in my opinion , you may even be very intelligent at times , the prince went on
1	i took up the exercise , and as nature has granted me certain abilities , today i can throw a lasso as well as any man in the world
1	once , a week before his death , katerina nikolaevna suggested inviting me for diversion , but he even frowned
1	can it be that i , too , will reach such a state some day ?
1	however , i have long ceased thinking of anything—it 's all the same to me
1	what a burden to bear !
1	i am , my friend , the legs mostly ; they brought me as far as the doorstep , but once i sat down here , they got swollen
1	saddle horses stood by this house , and the suite was gathering , evidently preparing for the sovereign 's levee
1	your cockiness is dear to you , you do not feel like apologizing , the staff captain went on , but for us old-timers , since we have grown up and , god willing , will die serving in the regiment , the honor of the regiment is dear to us , and bogdanych knows it
1	you know , dear heart , you need not have flown into a temper !
1	anna mikhailovna left him , and when she came back , he was sound asleep , his head resting on his arm
1	so it is finally settled ; you have determined to marry a sensible business man , avdotya romanovna , one who has a fortune ( has already made his fortune , that is so much more solid and impressive ) a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation , as mother writes , and who seems to be kind , as dounia herself observes
1	ptitsyn looked in and called ganya
1	denisov , rostov , and nesvitsky closed their eyes
1	cried razumihin , seizing him by the shoulder again
1	suddenly it was as if an electric shock ran through natasha 's whole being
1	and if she did beat me , what then ?
1	what do you say to that , dorofei trofimovich ?
1	of your town then there will gradually be no stone left upon stone— everything will turn upside down , everything will change as if by magic
1	it was not so at all !
1	except for two or three older writers , all modern literature seems to me not literature but some sort of handicraft , which exists only so as to be encouraged , though one is reluctant to use its products
1	said the weaver , coming to his senses
1	but that 's not all !
1	i already know one
1	i am not surprised at your intelligence , i am surprised that you , a man so pure and so immeasurably far above me—that you can walk with me and speak so simply and politely , as if nothing had happened !
1	but in a short while , some five minutes , the convent choir began to sing , there was no more weeping , everything was as before
1	i fancy i really am : i tell you these things for nothing and do not even expect a reward for it , he‐he !
1	my mother worked , my sister also took in sewing ; versilov lived idly , was capricious , and went on living with a great many of his former , rather expensive habits
1	that may have been accidental
1	such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system
1	the poor , dear man , he 's innocence itself !
1	aramis cried in transport
1	i mark all these meannesses in order to show how poorly fortified i was in the understanding of evil and good
1	help us , she said through her nose , in a sing-song voice
1	and the fact that he could not keep up the character , but confessed , makes him easier to believe in
1	i see , i see ; and how do we feel now , eh ?
1	those would be appropriate now , really , those are what i ought to put on now but i am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters ; i am somehow forgetful you see i have come to warn you , sonia , so that you might know that 's all—that 's all i came for
1	but the stairs , too , were quite deserted ; all the doors were shut ; he met no one
1	said raskolnikov , his face twitching nervously
1	i do not know how to reply to your sharp-ness !
1	but i hope you understand why i am here
1	her , the dark-haired one
1	the primitive quality of the word appears to have alarmed our predecessors , who translate it as wishing , desire , will , intention , choice , volition , and render it variously at various times
1	and did i really do it for the fatherland ?
1	why are you so disturbed ?
1	and she broke off with a strange laugh
1	they say that the wretch lost in the deserts of america can feel the approach of a snake in the same way
1	so much the better if you do not understand , and , i confess , my friend , i was sure of that
1	it 's all my stepan 's fault
1	the princess rose quickly to meet him and gave him her hand
1	and you yourself would do the same ?
1	sonia too was very busy
1	she gazed indifferently at her empty courtyard , thought of nothing , wanted nothing , and later , when night fell , went to sleep and dreamed of her empty courtyard
1	speaking of holbein ’ s christ , he says that it shows nature as some huge machine of the newest construction , which has senselessly seized , crushed , and swallowed up , blankly and unfeelingly , a great and priceless being
1	i took it under my care with your mama 's permission
1	he waved his hand weakly to razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister , took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking
1	ryabovsky , what do you say of that forehead ?
1	i buried my husband to‐day
1	he sobbed , but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest
1	the gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies ' fluffles , they are beyond anything you can fancy
1	so you came here to conquer hearts , to win over high society , to take revenge on devil ivanovich because you are an illegitimate son , is that what you wanted ?
1	only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane
1	it wo not do , princess , it wo not do , he said , when the princess , having taken and closed the notebook with the next day 's lesson , was getting ready to leave
1	i must also inform you , said the rhetor , that our order conveys its teaching not only by words , but by other means which affect the true seeker of wisdom and virtue perhaps even more strongly than verbal explanations
1	do you think there 's a place on earth that the cardinal can not touch , if he wishes to take the trouble of reaching out his hand ?
1	it suddenly turned up here , in the skirt of my own frock coat
1	he said to him , with a well‐feigned irritability
1	woman was created for our ruin , and it is from her that all our miseries come
1	the captain 's face expressed the anxiety of a schoolboy who is asked to recite a lesson he had not learned
1	she smiles in order to charm me , she fawns on me ; i am sorry , but i begin to feel disgust
1	i fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me ; parasha came on to the scene again , and not she alone ; in fact there was a tremendous to‐do
1	from the landing where pierre stood , another stairway led to the back door
1	this was the first time she had spoken to him of the project , and she launched out into the most alluring details
1	and don ’ t think that it ’ s all so innocent and unthreatening for us ; oh , we must respond , and swiftly , swiftly !
1	and how sorry i was for him sometimes !
1	and therefore to imagine the action of a man that is subject only to the law of necessity , without the slightest remainder of freedom , is as impossible as to imagine a totally free action
1	about a year ago , while doing research in the royal library for my history of louis xiv , i chanced upon the memoirs of monsieur d'artagnan , printed—like most works of that period , when authors were anxious to tell the truth without going for a more or less long turn in the bastille—in amsterdam , by pierre rouge
1	bonsoir , lise , [ ] said prince andrei , standing up and kissing her hand politely , as if she were a stranger
1	and you say you will wait for me in argentières ?
1	he was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards , of half‐animate abortions , conceited , half‐educated coxcombs , who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve , however sincerely
1	he threw down the pillow , but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt
1	and he was enchanted by the evening , and the country houses and dachas along the way , and the birches , and that quiet mood all around , when it seemed that , together with the workers , the fields , the woods , and the sun were preparing to rest on the eve of the holy day—to rest and perhaps to pray
1	in my opinion , the best thing you can do now is abandon the study of medicine entirely
1	'you are perishing because of me , old man
1	so you have understood the whole disposition of the troops ?
1	he did not notice the road at all and suddenly found himself at the office ; in the porter 's lodge he took the overcoat off , looked it all over , and entrusted it to the porter 's special care
1	well , then , my dear girl , said d'artagnan , establishing himself in an armchair , come here till i tell you that you are the prettiest soubrette i have ever seen !
1	he finished eating it as he walked away
1	the third and most incomprehensible thing consists in the fact that the people who study history deliberately refuse to see that the flanking march can not possibly be ascribed to any one man , that no one ever foresaw it , that at that time this maneuver , just like the retreat from fili , was never pictured by anyone in its entirety , but proceeded step by step , event by event , moment by moment , from a countless number of the most diverse conditions , and only presented itself in its entirety when it had been accomplished and become past
1	he will pick on her in order to be rude to me
1	he sleeps like a top , soundly , quietly , and god grant he may sleep ten hours
1	in this wing , sir ?
1	the one thing pierre now desired with all the forces of his soul was to get away as quickly as possible from those dreadful impressions in which he had lived that day , to return to the ordinary conditions of life , and fall peacefully asleep in a room on his own bed
1	the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand , not even a willow near it ; only in the far distance , a copse lay , a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon
1	but why did you ask ?
1	i would never seen her with such a face before
1	asked nastasya filippovna , not concealing the most squeamish loathing
1	what does she say when she comes to you ?
1	ganya suddenly turned to him
1	she lay as if alive
1	one word , only one word from you—and i ’ m saved
1	svidrigaïlov 's lips were twisted in a condescending smile ; but he was in no smiling mood
1	his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him ; his smile and glance were more cheerful and attractive
1	raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here
1	yes , milord , but with the hope of soon becoming enemies
1	he got up from the chair
1	from a good family , educated , and—a monster , a monster to the last degree !
1	that 's good , he said , sifting his words
1	she lived at number six on the place royale , which was then a fashionable quarter
1	the question was not put quite like that , observed porfiry
1	i remember him then , all purple , coming into our classroom
1	'today , she says , 'right now , i will bring him the money and fling it in his face ; he wanted to insult me , she says , 'like safronov ' ( that 's our merchant ) ; 'only safronov insulted me like a crude peasant , and this one like a cunning jesuit
1	but let 's admit that you are a slave from the first beginning
1	i am not able
1	two magnificent ladies were sitting in the carriage
1	she 's such a heart , nicolas , i am so glad !
1	bedridden by then , ippolit purposely sent for the prince to tell him the story
1	the first frenchman with the hooked nose came so close that the expression on his face could already be seen
1	but why are you all standing , ladies and gentlemen , please be seated , congratulate me and the prince !
1	impossible even to hope
1	you would not know what the subject of their conversation was ?
1	he did not yet dare to express his joy fully , but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton‐weight had fallen off his heart
1	the nanny was bored and asked me to send nastasya egorovna—oh , as if i could be bothered with that !
1	the ways of god are inscrutable !
1	now i know you personally , i am convinced of it
1	there were three in the cardinal 's party ; the musketeers , including their lackeys , were seven
1	zhenya looked sadly at her sister and mother and left
1	he thought , looking at his naked body , and he shuddered , not so much from the cold as from revulsion and horror , incomprehensible to himself , at the sight of this enormous number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond
1	would not it be natural for me to turn to the one who ever since childhood has replaced my father , whose kindness towards me i have seen for so many years ?
1	( ) the relation of the man committing the act to the external world ,
1	up to now , thank god , i have been a friend to my children and have enjoyed their full trust , said the countess , repeating the error of many parents who suppose that their children have no secrets from them
1	well , and i have long guessed by tatyana pavlovna 's face that she 's in love with me
1	lord de winter said slyly
1	devil take it , said athos , i would gladly propose that you stake planchet , but as it 's already been done , the englishman might not want any more of it
1	the kingdom of heaven to her—and now enough , madam , leave me in peace !
1	listen : i was sure of her love then
1	he does not understand it , and therefore i must explain it to him , he must hear me out , thought the old prince
1	after him came another soldier on a cart
1	except maybe when i hand him some papers , and he asks , how is it outside ?
1	no , it ca not be , it would be too extraordinary , she thought , and the moment she thought it , the face and figure of prince andrei , in a fur coat with a snow-sprinkled collar , appeared on the landing where the servant stood with a candle
1	i felt extreme pleasure , delight , and began to climb
1	it 's obvious all you women are crybabies , said petya , pacing the room in big , resolute strides
1	he bent over her once more
1	and say to the prince : remember what you promised ?
1	look here , what subjects : here he 's painted his room
1	i was stunned earlier ; i had no time earlier to reflect on it , he thought , recalling his first encounter with liza , but now i must find out
1	the painting made an overwhelming impression on my husband , and he stood before it as if dumbstruck …
1	he will be at your orders at once
1	yes , you said you had this letter , and i thought : since he has such a letter , why should he lose what 's his ?
1	i am listening to your eminence with the greatest attention , replied a woman 's voice that made the musketeer shiver
1	it would be another thing if i myself had been in love then
1	i ca not stand these old men
1	he kissed anna pavlovna 's hand and , narrowing his eyes , looked around at the whole company
1	i , of course , understood very little of it , but dounia explained to me that , though he is not a man of great education , he is clever and seems to be good‐natured
1	) , was not quite acting properly in this matter
1	j'espère , mon cher ami , que vous remplirez le désir de votre père
1	berg and his wife , who were not dancing , came up to them
1	i am not going anywhere with you !
1	at last everybody was seated , the steps were folded and flipped back into the carriage , the door banged shut , the strongbox was sent for , the countess leaned out and said what she ought
1	it was i began raskolnikov
1	the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse , partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime
1	the uncle smiled without answering
1	further down , the dnieper carouses ; he has no care for anyone : he storms , and it is gloomy for the prisoner to hear his monotonous noise
1	ivan ivanovich asked for the reading to proceed , and taras tikhonovich went on : this gentleman , ivan , son of nikifor , dovgochkhun , when i came to him with friendly offers , publicly called me by a name offensive to me and defaming to my honor , namely : goose , whereas it is known to the whole mirgorod region that i have hitherto in no way ever been called , and have no intention of being called , this vile animal
1	one of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy
1	we always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception , something vast , vast !
1	all eyes were involuntarily turned to this french column that was moving towards them , winding down the terraces of the slope
1	they minced not for the sake of some sort of profit , but just so , because he was a man favored with the gifts of nature
1	the old newspapers and the tea were brought
1	there have been examples
1	she smiled again and took a slightly stronger grip on prince vassily 's arm
1	when petitioners would come for information to the desk where i sat – i would gnash my teeth at them , and felt an inexhaustible delight when i managed to upset someone
1	it should be done peacefully , lovingly
1	he was about fifty years old ; but ukrainian tales the deep despondency on his face and a sort of wasted pallor showed that his soul had been crushed and destroyed all of a sudden , in a single moment , and all the old gaiety and noisy life had disappeared forever
1	oh , how good it is there !
1	you see the kingdom of the good and the true on earth , and i do not see it
1	he was in love with his every button , his every fingernail – absolutely in love , and he looked it !
1	that 's just one example
1	may i , ekaterina vladimirovna ?
1	i brought a candle and , reaching out my hand , which he seized , helped him to drag himself up
1	that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago
1	khoma and the cossack stopped respectfully by the door
1	which meant that , just at the time when i was abusing her , she was departing
1	but it 's particularly so with women
1	he was not completely unconscious , however , all the time he was ill ; he was in a feverish state , sometimes delirious , sometimes half conscious
1	i would portray how the black shadow of a bat flits over the white road and settles on the white chimneys of the houses
1	come bold and free into my house
1	here neither kind , nor sex , nor rank is mentioned—that means an animal can also be guilty
1	since yakov played the fiddle very well , especially russian songs , shakhkes sometimes invited him to join the orchestra for fifty kopecks a day , not counting gifts from the guests
1	then their circle widens : they finally arrive at marrying a merchant 's daughter who can play the piano , with a hundred thousand or so in cash and a heap of bearded relations
1	y'est un allemand ; mais brave garçon , s'il en fut
1	for a long time they kept glancing at the red rugai , who , his hunched back dirty with mud , jingling his collar , trotted behind the uncle 's horse 's legs with the calm look of a conqueror
1	when he talks , only his eyes and eyebrows smile , as generally with people given to mockery
1	it 's been ages , ages
1	that i understood ; that was quite other than the meeting with that one
1	each time it comes out as fun in the beginning , but by the end it turns senseless each time , because nobody knows how to finish ; though maybe with you it would be more amusing
1	pavel pavlovich greedily fell upon the water ; having taken three gulps , he raised his head , looked very intently into the face of velchaninov , who was standing before him with the glass in his hand , but said nothing and went on drinking
1	not in the least , versilov replied , getting up from his place and taking his hat
1	the tea sat on the table ; we did not touch it : it went so far that i purposely refused to begin drinking , so as to make it still harder for her ; and it would have been awkward for her to begin
1	you can , madame , he said emphatically
1	how can he love you , when he knows that you will be called away from him any moment
1	his conversation was a fact without accessories
1	he silently accepted the glove from the adjutant , sat down in the lady 's place , putting his big hands on his symmetrically displayed knees in the naïve pose of an egyptian statue , and decided to himself that this was precisely as it had to be and that that evening , so as not to lose his head and do something foolish , he ought not to act according to his own reasoning , but give himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him
1	some of the stewards ( there were half-literate managers among them ) listened fearfully , taking what he said to imply that the young count was displeased with their stewardship and their concealing of money ; others , after the first fright , were amused by pierre 's lisp and the new words they had never heard before ; a third group simply took pleasure in hearing how the master spoke ; a fourth group , the most intelligent , the head steward among them , understood from his speech how they ought to treat the master in order to achieve their own aims
1	we can eat as much as we want all through the feast days
1	or do all our strong impulses , all the whirlwind of our desires and boiling passions , come merely from our bright youth and seem deep and devastating only because of that ?
1	yes , and now the landlady is going too , still weeping and moaning and then her door slammed now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms , exclaiming , disputing , calling to one another , raising their voices to a shout , dropping them to a whisper
1	i had your word as a soldier and your oath as a gentleman ; i hoped i could count on them
1	do not you see i have no time to lose ?
1	it ’ s an example of an official address to an important person , also a rounded script , nice and black , the writing is black , but remarkably tasteful
1	mrs lialikov , a stout , elderly lady in a black silk dress with fashionable sleeves , but , judging by her face , a simple and illiterate one , looked at the doctor with anxiety and hesitated , not daring to offer him her hand
1	her dresses were always the most fashionable
1	but i notice , my dear , something nervous and soulfelt suddenly sounded in his voice , something that went to the heart , which happened terribly rarely with him , i notice that you yourself speak of it all too ardently
1	yet he himself knows that his moans will be of no use to him ; he knows better than anyone that he is only straining and irritating himself and others in vain ; he knows that even the public before whom he is exerting himself , and his whole family , are already listening to him with loathing , do not believe even a pennyworth of it , and understand in themselves that he could moan differently , more simply , without roulades and flourishes , and that it 's just from spite and craftiness that he is playing around like that
1	it 's a pity readers can not have a vivid description of its appearance
1	if he 's accused of distributing napoleon 's proclamations , that has not been proved , said pierre ( not looking at rastopchin ) , and vereshchagin
1	but into the middle of the dnieper they dare not look : no one except the sun and the blue sky looks there
1	pavel pavlovich 's teeth even chattered as he articulated this
1	in the best , the friendliest and simplest relations , flattery or praise is necessary , just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning
1	yes , loved me from spite ; that 's the strongest love
1	it was as if she deliberately paid not the slightest attention to him
1	first of all , my dear prince , don ’ t be angry with me , and if there was anything on my part—forget it
1	my aunt had the honor
1	give me your hand ; i ’ ll press it firmly , like this … you do still give me your hand , though ?
1	that she apparently rejected evgeny pavlych about a month ago , and that they had a rather formal talk , her sisters told us , as a guess … a firm guess , however
1	alpatych 's courtiers—the land reeve , the clerk , the scullery maid , the cook , two old women , a boy servant , the coachmen , and other domestics—saw him off
1	he threw himself on his knees , grasped that hand , and respectfully pressed his lips to it
1	the prince is this for me , that i believe in him as the first truly devoted man in my whole life
1	when they heard the order of napoleon , who , in return for their mutilation and death , presented them in consolation with the words of posterity about their having been at the battle of moscow , they cried vive l'empereur !
1	and you bought it yourself ?
1	already this one word , that he 's a vater—i am not speaking only of germans—that he has a family , that he lives like everybody else , has expenses like everybody else , has duties like everybody else— here you do not become rothschild , but remain only a moderate man
1	some of them tried to get in
1	he will do what i want
1	but the russian type of nobility has never resembled the european
1	speaking later about the lawyer who all but won the case , he also said : and you know what a lawyer is : a lawyer is a hired conscience
1	the pseudoscientific terms and even a certain clumsy use of parentheses , as joseph frank has shown , are the narrator 's deliberate mockery of chernyshevsky 's writing
1	at the word apologies , a cloud darkened athos 's brow , a haughty smile flitted over porthos 's lips , and aramis responded with a negative gesture
1	behold—he was no longer there
1	he said that he did not want to know of her existence , but gave her fair warning beforehand that she dare not show her face to him
1	and again she could not believe it : he , he is a murderer !
1	he will be furious , but i do not care ; i am within my rights
1	quiet , do not disturb me
1	i have marveled at that terribly all the while i have been coming to see you
1	it chapter thirteen : conclusion happened in the following way : lambert had after all inclined him to take part with him and , getting hold of the document then , had told him all the details and all the circumstances of the undertaking , and , finally , the last moment of the plan as well , that is , when versilov thought up the combination of deceiving tatyana pavlovna
1	and prince nikolai ivanovich wo not refuse you for anything , especially now , in his joy
1	any shock , any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once , but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed
1	fowl , outbuildings , barns , what not else ; vodka of various flavors ; pears and plums in the orchards ; poppies , cabbage , and peas in the garden
1	then i had suddenly fallen asleep for a while on the sofa in the corner , and lambert had immediately felt my pocket then and made sure that a piece of paper was actually sewn up in it
1	over his shoulder hangs a game bag with a crumpled black grouse in it
1	oui , oui , il est charmant he knows anecdotes , but we would better invite him later
1	the prince gave a sudden start
1	the children are crying
1	you know , for instance , beforehand with positive certainty that this man , this most reputable and exemplary citizen , will on no consideration give you money ; and indeed i ask you why should he ?
1	the crowd of girls shouted , laughing
1	i will probably kill you the fourth time , he said to him , as he offered a hand to get him to his feet
1	d'artagnan 's friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay , observing at the same time that it was still possible to cancel it
1	why go riding into the middle of a battalion ?
1	it was all smoldering in me
1	d'artagnan said to himself
1	i will get it at once !
1	i refuse to know you if you do not !
1	this was speransky , secretary of state , counselor to the sovereign , and his companion at erfurt , where he had seen and spoken with napoleon more than once
1	so , chum , you have not been to the deacon 's new house yet ?
1	everything was being done by itself
1	he repeated aloud , sighing
1	but another minute goes by , she hears voices : it is the veterinarian coming home from the club
1	he turned to balashov with this question , and the recollection evidently pushed him back onto the track of his morning 's wrath , which was still fresh in him
1	but the prince did not know what to ask further and how to finish the question ; besides , his heart was pounding so hard that it was difficult for him even to speak
1	natalia vassilievna was perfectly respected in t— ; she , however , did not value that very much , accepting it as her due , but at home she always knew how to receive superbly , having trained pavel pavlovich so well that his manners were ennobled enough even for receiving the highest provincial authorities
1	but to leave there , to run off together , to go to another part of france , where they could live peacefully because they would not be known , required money
1	then he opened them and whispered softly : what about the tea ?
1	once it 's proved to you that , essentially speaking , one little drop of your own fat should be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow men , and that in this result all so-called virtues and obligations and other ravings and prejudices will finally be resolved , go ahead and accept it , there 's nothing to be done , because two times two is – mathematics
1	a little later she saw him stepping out the grand rond with a partner , and this time he staggered and shouted something , to the great embarrassment of his lady , and anya remembered how three years ago he had staggered and shouted in the same way at a ball , and it had ended with a policeman taking him home to bed , and next day the director had threatened to dismiss him from his work
1	but pseldonymov was a man of firm character
1	( ) finally , the sixth and for me the most important consideration concerns the small significance which , to my mind , so-called great men have in historical events
1	ah , but that athos went on , speaking half to himself and half to d'artagnan , but if i kill you , i will look like a child eater !
1	but still he went
1	so it is mme de lannoy 's opinion that she gave them to buckingham ?
1	même le divorce , [ ] he said
1	oh , monsieur , just keep on going , you may become the equal of m de voiture and m de benserade !
1	why do you come and ask for me and say nothing
1	not precisely of the tubercles
1	what , is a man to die like a dog ?
1	wait , i ’ ll make up the bed meanwhile , and then you can lie down … and i ’ ll lie down with you … and we ’ ll listen … because i don ’ t know yet , man … i don ’ t know everything yet , man , so i ’ m telling you ahead of time , so you ’ ll know all about it ahead of time …
1	or throw up life altogether !
1	wait , said the prince , i asked the caretaker and the old woman earlier whether nastasya filippovna hadn ’ t spent the night
1	i thought so myself … but still it ’ s somehow hard to believe …
1	here i obtained a situation i obtained it and i lost it again
1	yes , duke , i know you are very indulgent towards the queen , too indulgent perhaps ; and i warn you , we shall have to talk about that later
1	i maintain that if the discoveries of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one , a dozen , a hundred , or more men , newton would have had the right , would indeed have been in duty bound to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity
1	no , just add two bottles of champagne , and the difference will go for the napkins
1	svidrigaïlov looked intently at raskolnikov and suddenly , after a brief pause , dropping his voice , asked : but how is it , rodion romanovitch ; you do not seem yourself ?
1	i believe i served you sincerely , without arguing and pestering ; i never asked you what sort of happiness you wanted to look for with aglaya
1	how could it happen that it should depend on my decision—who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live ?
1	even to spend the night with you
1	in fact , for our parents such a conversation as we are having now would have been unthinkable ; they did not talk at night , they slept soundly , but we , our generation , sleep badly , are anguished , talk a lot , and keep trying to decide if we are right or not
1	only pleasant curiosity and … an obligingly noble soul , yes , sir !
1	the moon had risen high over the house , lighting up the sleeping garden , the paths ; the dahlias and roses in the flower garden in front of the house were clearly visible and seemed to be all of the same color
1	why , what for , when he 's superior to everyone in the world without that ?
1	i happened , too , to hear of the scene at the office , from a man who described it capitally , unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness
1	there was another question he could not decide : why were they all so fond of sonia ?
1	and maxim ivanovich sent for the tutor , for pyotr stepanovich ; they had not seen each other since that occasion
1	before him sat only a uniform , a bodice , a tailcoat , before which an artist feels chilled and all imagination collapses
1	he speaks like a parisian , and he 's only mocking those russians who want to speak french aloud among themselves in society , but do not know how dans les wagons , the long one clarified
1	but the happy day came , and when natasha , on that sunday so memorable for her , in a white muslin dress , came home after communion , for the first time in many months she felt calm and not burdened by the life that lay ahead of her
1	she 's such an unearthly being !
1	she said , glancing at her brother , as if asking him : what on earth is it ?
1	if they would told him to jump head foremost from the staircase , he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service
1	of course not , and it is even unnatural
1	the porter sullenly pulled the bell rope that rang upstairs and turned away
1	she began to prepare for his coming , began to do up her room for him , to clean the furniture , to wash and put up new hangings and so on
1	natasha covered her hair with a white kerchief and , holding it by the ends with both hands , went outside
1	for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna , even hunting her out at the bazaar , at every instant called her pani
1	there 's slush , muck , wet snow in the grave — they wo not go to any trouble over you
1	finally , though it ’ s shameless and improper to pursue a person so directly , i ’ ll tell you directly : i ’ ve come to seek your friendship , my dear prince
1	that , of course , is nothing like quietism , alexandra said to herself
1	the curtain rose again
1	that is precisely the name of my traveling companion
1	and i am the more convinced of this , so to speak , suspicion , seeing that if , for example , one takes the antithesis of the normal man , that is , the man of heightened consciousness , who came , of course , not from the bosom of nature but from a retort ( this is almost mysticism , gentlemen , but i suspect that , too ) , this retort man sometimes folds before his antithesis so far that he honestly regards himself , with all his heightened consciousness , as a mouse and not a man
1	she looked intently , maliciously and mistrustfully
1	if you please , your excellency , petrusha has come with papers , said one of the maids who assisted the nanny , addressing prince andrei , who was sitting on a child 's little chair , frowning , his hands trembling , pouring drops of medicine from a vial into a glass half filled with water
1	during nikolai 's brief visit , as usual in a house where there are children , he resorted to prince andrei 's little son when there was a moment of silence , stroking his head and asking if he wanted to be a hussar
1	observed nastasya , not taking her eyes off him
1	the captain looked at pierre
1	he was an old man , over sixty , not tall , very thin , bent over , white-haired , a naive smile on his face , his eyes tearful , his lips constantly smacking as if he were sucking candy
1	at last i shook my fist in his ugly face , and told him as a cousin i would brain him
1	the walls of the rooms were adorned with several paintings , big and small , in old-fashioned narrow frames
1	he wanted terribly to meet someone , to talk with someone , even a stranger , and only that , finally , suggested to him the thought of a doctor and that his hand probably ought to be properly bandaged
1	he dozed off on the bench , but his anxiousness continued in his sleep
1	porfiry petrovitch had turned to go , but he seemed to prick up his ears at this
1	does that mean you know i ’ m sincere ? … maybe i won ’ t drink anymore
1	but at the very moment , he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness , and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation , though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion , obviously with a motive , from necessity
1	recommandez , je vous prie , à leppich d'être bien attentif sur l'endroit ou il descendra la première fois , pour ne pas se tromper et ne pas tomber dans les mains de l'ennemi
1	at the same time i added that he , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , with all his virtues , was not worth sofya semyonovna 's little finger , though he spoke so ill of her
1	but … maybe it ’ s a good thing i let on … a strange idea was beginning to flash in his head , though not a very clear one as yet
1	and the wise ones and those of understanding will say , 'oh lord , why dost thou receive these men ?
1	i ca not help it i will come in half an hour
1	no , what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they , the children and if she has not gone out of her mind but who says she has not gone out of her mind ?
1	he wanted to resolve it , but felt with terror that in this case he lacked the resolve that he knew he had and that indeed was in him
1	so she carries the keys in a pocket on the right
1	why do they torment me ?
1	nastasya was continually out of the house , especially in the evenings ; she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop , and always left the door ajar
1	[ ] came from all sides
1	merci , friend , i never once crept up here , not even when i was renting the apartment
1	what is it , ma'am ?
1	but i was already a despot in my soul ; i wanted to have unlimited power over his soul ; i wanted to instill in him a contempt for his surrounding milieu ; i demanded of him a haughty and final break with that milieu
1	are not you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering ?
1	again he waited till evening , again fell asleep , again dreamed of some official who was an official and at the same time a bassoon
1	so you are in funds ?
1	katerina kept listening , not taking her eyes off him
1	at dinner the conversation was about subjects most closely related to dining
1	splendid , madame , and there is an old proverb which says that youth is shaped by travel
1	he also built a school in melikhovo in , which came out so well that he chekhov as naturalist ( ) , in chekhov , ed
1	lebedev addressed kolya in an all but affectionate voice , having to inform the prince of a matter essentially of concern …
1	something strange , as it were , passed between them some idea , some hint , as it were , slipped , something awful , hideous , and suddenly understood on both sides razumihin turned pale
1	but he came quite tipsy , and asked for three bottles again , and then he lifted up one leg , and began playing the pianoforte with one foot , and that is not at all right in an honourable house , and he ganz broke the piano , and it was very bad manners indeed and i said so
1	the conversation and the accounting with mitenka did not last long
1	do you know that one can be blamelessly to blame ?
1	all these anecdotes are the height of indecency , but you should know that this type of the indecent is much deeper and more widespread than we think
1	buckingham wanted to smile a last time , but death arrested his thought , which remained graven on his forehead like a last kiss of love
1	you can imagine what happened
1	the clergy were there , the factory managers and their wives , merchants and tavernkeepers from other villages
1	i myself am a … medical man ( he did not say doctor ) , and having said that , he pointed to the room with his hand for some reason , as if protesting against his present situation
1	but … why did i leave my room then ?
1	indeed , pity never possesses us so strongly as at the sight of beauty touched by the corrupting breath of depravity
1	in misery he asked himself this question , and could not understand that , at the very time he had been standing looking into the river , he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions
1	during the day i had nothing to fear
1	echoed akim petrovich ; the guests stirred again , but the stupidest thing of all was that pseldonymov , though he did bow again , even now did not smile , just as if he were made of wood
1	written in and still one of the most penetrating discussions of chekhov 's art , contains the following description of the spiritual condition of that time : to calculate beforehand is impossible
1	he gave direct , precise , and perfectly satisfactory evidence about everything , as a result of which the prince was eliminated from the case at the very beginning
1	this sokolovich owes all the happiness of his life and career to me , to me alone and no one else , but … here we are
1	there 's no need now that 's all stuff !
1	then if , by excess of love , i have made myself guilty before you , you will forgive me ?
1	couldn ’ t you help me ?
1	a telephone was also installed in the local administrative office , but there it soon stopped working , because it got infested with bedbugs and cockroaches
1	zametov 's unexpected presence struck raskolnikov unpleasantly
1	as soon as she began thinking about him , to her memory of him were added the memories of the old prince , of princess marya , of last night 's performance , and of kuragin
1	granted that he 'let it slip , though he is a sensible man , ( yet maybe it was not a slip at all , but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible ) but dounia , dounia ?
1	what farce is this ?
1	he gave him some medicine , a powder , i saw it , and then your coming here
1	the steps died away
1	they only arrived yesterday , may i ask you ?
1	it 's more in your interest , believe me
1	quite the contrary , said athos , it must be carefully kept
1	who is the curly‐headed one who has just peeped out ?
1	they must have come for some raid : some of them have muskets ; spurs jingle , sabers rattle
1	the moment she saw him , she suddenly burst into tears , but the prince at once calmed her down , and she laughed
1	you know , it 's even frightening
1	his former fantastic thoughts and apprehensions ( after his conversation with lebedev ) now seemed to him , in sudden but frequent recollections , such an unrealizable , impossible , and even ridiculous dream !
1	pavel pavlovich , as soon as he saw his fiancee come in , approached her at once with a grin
1	there they found out that the king and buckingham were hawking in the marshes some two or three leagues away
1	do not , do not look at me like that
1	and the more kutuzov desired it , the less he allowed himself to believe it
1	the women from our village are working here , so i am here with them
1	pavel pavlovich peered into his eyes defiantly and at the same time with some strange uneasiness
1	it was the order of st george , first degree
1	she aimed straight at my head
1	he whispered with trembling and paled lips
1	after dinner they all went out to the balcony to have coffee
1	petya had decided to go directly to the place where the sovereign was and explain directly to some gentleman-in-waiting ( petya thought that a sovereign was always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting ) that he , count rostov , despite his youth , wished to serve the fatherland , that youth could be no hindrance to devotion , and that he was prepared while getting ready to go , petya had prepared many fine words which he would say to the gentleman-in-waiting
1	peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the leaf buds of the oak are sprouting , and indeed a cold wind blows every spring when the oak is sprouting
1	another voice responded to the sovereign , telling of the resolution just arrived at by the moscow nobility
1	well , what , are you finished ?
1	going into my room , i sat down on the bed , thoughtful and agitated
1	she was gazing at me with those eyes
1	he is in 'an intelligible condition ' !
1	a french hussar colonel , obviously just out of bed , came riding from the village on a handsome , well-fed gray horse , accompanied by two hussars
1	the blacksmith followed them timidly , afraid of slipping on the parquet floor at every step
1	everyone came out to see velchaninov off ; the children brought liza , with whom they had been playing in the garden
1	let 's go , then , though you are in a fever , but there he did not finish
1	it 's nice , your excellency , if you would be so pleased !
1	above all , you are not mad !
1	she was running after him , calling wait !
1	you have known bezukhov for a long time , have not you ?
1	you do love him more than anything in the world , you are looking for a friend , an ideal in him ?
1	fearing a scandal , the host , with the help of his waiters , carried the wounded man to the kitchen , where he was looked after a little
1	reading and then lying in bed , he kept thinking about ivan dmitrich , and waking up the next morning , he remembered that he had made the acquaintance of an intelligent and interesting man yesterday and resolved to visit him again at the first opportunity
1	you were delirious when you did all this !
1	he will save europe !
1	but 'notes ' such as yours could , it seems to me , serve as material for a future artistic work , for a future picture—of a disorderly but already bygone epoch
1	ah , it ’ s such a simple-hearted story ; the story of an old soldier , an eyewitness to the french occupation of moscow ; there are charming things in it
1	she drops into a chair and begins to sob
1	you should know that my memory 's rotten beyond words : tell me something or not , it 's all the same
1	he 's a nice old man , i repeat again , simple and merry at home , but the moment he 's in the office , you ca not even imagine !
1	i see a cross in his hand—he must have just taken it off—on a worn light blue ribbon , only it ’ s a real tin one , you could see it at first glance , big , eight-pointed , of the full byzantine design
1	the older and more respectable of them all , as if by common consent , stayed away
1	you understand , d'artagnan , i can not insult the unknown donor , d'artagnan picked up
1	velchaninov slapped himself on the forehead
1	shouted the peasant woman
1	and that is what each of them thought
1	i have no wish now to judge alexei nikanorovich 's intentions in this matter , and , i confess , after his death i was painfully undecided about what to do with this document , especially in view of the impending decision of the court case
1	it owes to courtilz the incantation of names , not only of athos , porthos , and aramis , the three musketeers whom d'artagnan meets in m de tréville 's antechamber , but also of their opponents jussac , biscarat , cahusac , and bernajoux , as well as the name of milady , who appears briefly in the memoirs as miledi x
1	countess marya glanced at him and turned to pierre
1	she was living somewhere , in some matrosskaya street , in a gawky little house , with darya alexeevna , but her carriage was just about the best in pavlovsk
1	he stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs , waited till they were out of hearing , and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when dmitri and nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry ; possibly he was seen , but not noticed
1	his face was frowning , his lips were compressed
1	the stocks are empty , the roads are impracticable
1	but raskolnikov was already stepping into the street
1	he was brought at once to the best rooms of the hotel , taken for the night by dolokhov
1	a cart drove past , raising dust , with an unsold horse running behind it , looking as if it were glad it had not been sold ; then a resisting cow was led past by the horns , then came another cart carrying drunken peasants , their legs dangling down
1	what 's more , m de tréville earns ten thousand ecus a year ; so he is a very great lord
1	in the name of the king , i arrest you and declare that you must surrender your sword to me , monsieur , and that without any resistance
1	as for me , i was decidedly offended by the prince 's last words ; the allusion to versilov being dishonorable was so clear ( and so astonishing ! )
1	the gentleman was like everybody else , there was nothing special about him , he had passed by quickly , but he had glanced at velchaninov somehow much too intently and for some reason had at once greatly attracted his attention
1	said the little old lady , addressing ivan fyodorovich , who at that moment was being offered a platter by a rustic waiter in a gray tailcoat with a black patch
1	a dashing frenchman in a blue greatcoat , hatless , with a red , frowning face , was fighting off some hussars with his bayonet , when petya galloped up , the frenchman had already fallen
1	i have heard from three men already that you pull noses so hard when you give a shave that they barely stay attached
1	the conversation was conducted in english , a language d'artagnan did not understand , but by the tone of it the young man guessed that the beautiful englishwoman was extremely angry
1	raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech , but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone 's opinion , and this revulsion took place in a flash , in one instant
1	we are not even brother and sister , but some sort of illegitimates , without a family name , a household serf 's children
1	he lowered his head and saw that the grass , which was almost under his feet , seemed to be growing deep and distant and that over it was water as transparent as a mountain spring , and the grass seemed to be at the deep bottom of some bright , transparent sea ; at least he clearly saw his own reflection in it , together with the old woman sitting on his back
1	sure , just you try it !
1	on leaving the office , they passed the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room
1	listen , now : i will call on you myself , without fail , and then i do hope
1	now , kindly taste our wine , and tell us , without reservation , what you think of it
1	does she even mean to have a funeral lunch ?
1	'on crime ' or something of the sort , i forget the title , i read it with pleasure two months ago in the periodical review
1	at least at the dacha , i want it to be otherwise , and rest assured that i will receive whomever i like and go wherever i like
1	here 's what i kept thinking it was strange that you gravely ill people , instead of staying in a quiet place , wound up on a ship , where the stuffiness , and the heat , and the tossing—everything , in short , threatens you with death , but now it 's all clear to me
1	at the bottom was a village
1	you were still sound asleep , and i did not know what to do
1	have you been at mother 's ?
1	before his departure , prince andrei had a long talk about something with his father , and princess marya noticed that before his departure they were both displeased with each other
1	pierre found it strange to look at this calm , indifferent crowd of people who did not know what was happening in his soul
1	give me the baby !
1	the feelings of both were so strong that they were not affected by the external , dreadful side of death , and they found no need to exacerbate their grief
1	[ ] was the will of the mass of the russian people transferred to napoleon in , when our troops in alliance with the french went to make war on austria ?
1	may my arms and legs wither !
1	i can ’ t , nastasya filippovna ; and generally i consider such a petit jeu impossible
1	to fear , to try to escape that force , to turn with requests or admonitions to the people who served as its tools , was useless
1	olga ivanovna obediently followed him
1	it was des roches le masle , canon of notre dame , and formerly the cardinal 's valet , who had proposed him to his eminence as a completely devoted man
1	i am in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , and think there is every probability of realising them
1	i said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger and that i did my sister honour making her sit beside you
1	stop joking , bilibin , said bolkonsky
1	because he has found his fatherland , which he had missed here , and he rejoices ; he has found the shore , the land , and he rushes to kiss it !
1	there 's no sense in it anyway
1	mr o areilly , the duke of buckingham said to him as he led him to the chapel , look at these diamond pendants and tell me what they are worth apiece
1	i went up to dergachev , squeezed his hand as hard as i could , and shook it several times , also as hard as i could
1	to all the questions put to him , important or quite trifling , he replied with equal vagueness
1	she suddenly turned quickly to me and peered at me piercingly for half a minute
1	but as soon as night brings darkness , he is visible again and is reflected in the lakes , and behind him , trembling , rides his shadow
1	it was anna andreevna 's brother , the kammerjunker , the young versilov , versilov 's son and therefore almost my brother
1	dounia did not ask , but she knew it was so
1	xxxiii : soubrette and mistress d'artagnan returned to milady 's the next day
1	in fact , if there could be any hope , it would be very ephemeral , because there would be no claim for assistance in that case , far from it and she is dreaming of a pension already , he‐he‐he !
1	besides , your mother and sister are here now ; you must think of them
1	along with that , he felt that the further the ground he stood on gave way under his feet , the more involuntarily he was bound to it
1	first of all , fedosei petrovich has known me even since my youngest years , he knew my late spouse , how i lived , and what my reputation is , sir , and , finally , i have a fortune , and here also i have now obtained a post and a promotion—so all this carries weight , sir
1	but why are you so keen about virtue ?
1	not for one hour , not for two hours , does the battle between polacks and cossacks go on
1	i said it , prince , said berg , recognizing prince andrei , only because i must carry out orders , because i always carry them out precisely excuse me , please , berg apologized for something
1	what are you shoving for , little master , see , everybody 's standing
1	his confidential valet appeared
1	everything would be saved !
1	i have come on business of my own , which i shall have the pleasure of explaining after her versilov nevertheless went on looking at me curiously
1	about that , avdotya romanovna said finally
1	but he liked that he was from a good family , had a fortune , that is , a big rental property with a manager , was related to some not-insignificant people , and , on top of that , carried himself well
1	what is he seeking with his eyes ?
1	the girl studies at the conservatory , she 's always in good society , and she 's dressed god knows how
1	if anyone had come in , what would he have thought ?
1	but since i would not hand over the document for anything down to the last moment , he ultimately decided even to throw in with anna andreevna , so as not to lose all profit , and therefore he foisted his services on her with all his might , till the very last hour , and i know that he even offered , if need be , to procure a priest
1	how is it you do not go head over heels ?
1	how is it she 's not bored and ashamed !
1	your horses , your lackeys , your looks , my lords , had all been described to me
1	i know he won ’ t shoot himself , general , my much-esteemed general , but all the same … for i ’ m the host
1	he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation , and only the other day he won an important case
1	katerina ivanovna ran to the window ; there , on a broken chair in the corner , a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood , in readiness for washing her children 's and husband 's linen that night
1	katerina ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him , in the first place , because he was the one educated visitor , and , as everyone knew , was in two years to take a professorship in the university , and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral
1	rather than depicting society , he borrows the sign system of literature — anthropological and fictional — that depicts society , in order to depict and address human conscience , conscious , unconscious , subconscious
1	i will not allow myself to be tortured , he whispered , instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought
1	something was happening to him entirely new , sudden and unknown
1	can he have gone away ?
1	shall we take a cab ?
1	well , and i do know that i am a blackguard , a scoundrel , a self-lover , a lazybones
1	nastasya filippovna , who was walking along as if not noticing anyone in particular , suddenly turned in their direction , and seemed only now to recognize evgeny pavlovich
1	why , you said you would just greet your aunt and come straight over , and then you did not !
1	razumihin looked after him thoughtfully
1	what are you doing standing there , ivan ivanovich ?
1	perhaps i do not want to go to siberia yet , sonia , he said
1	hit her in the face , in the eyes , in the eyes , cried mikolka
1	what is your name , if i may inquire ?
1	this lackey was my compatriot , so that we made friends all the more quickly , in that there were strong similarities of character between us
1	he would not be alone in his room , there would be two of them everywhere !
1	would not it be better
1	so kutuzov replied , and he went on using all his powers to keep the troops from attacking
1	after that they spent another hour or hour and a half in serious and preoccupied conversation
1	i knew one poor fellow of whom i was told later that he starved to death , and , i remember , that made me furious : if it had been possible to revive the poor fellow , i think i would have executed him
1	mme bonacieux mechanically ate a few mouthfuls and dipped her lips into her glass
1	whoever deals with you becomes a woman himself
1	repeated nikolai , who in his heart did not like nikolenka , but whom he was always ready to acknowledge as nice
1	and if i put you in prison—say you have been there a month , or two , or three—remember my word , you will confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise
1	it 's not exactly this old man 's death , he replied , not only his death ; there 's something else now that has hit on the same spot may god bless this moment and our life , for a long time to come !
1	this evening as well , aramis sat looking sombre and dreamy
1	the sick soldier sokolov , pale , thin , with blue circles around his eyes , sat in his place , the only one unshod and undressed , staring questioningly , with eyes prominent in his emaciated face , at his comrades , who paid no attention to him , moaning softly and regularly
1	but—who knows ? — perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow he ground his teeth and sank into silence again
1	his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering ; in spite of the heat he felt cold
1	ah , i have upset him with my chatter !
1	aie , they will do nikifor wrong , i am afraid they will !
1	in this child ’ s eyes flashing with patriotism , he said , i have read the opinion of the whole russian people
1	what kind of ice cream , marya dmitrievna ?
1	that ’ s quite wrong , cried kolya , and it was quite the contrary : ippolit seized the prince ’ s hand yesterday and kissed it twice , i saw it myself , and that was the end of all the explanations , except that the prince simply said it would be better for him at the dacha , and he instantly agreed to come as soon as he felt better
1	look it up in suvorin 's calendar
1	non , il fera son entrée demain , [ ] he said and went on with his stories
1	as if his earlier dream had merged with reality
1	in the unfortunate , sobbing , exhausted man whose leg had just been removed , he recognized anatole kuragin
1	their acquaintance had already begun in luga , and it had always seemed to me that vasin was not indifferent to her
1	yes , very nice , said rostov , smiling
1	here , drink this glass , drink some water , drink it !
1	your most devoted servant submits this report , dating it , and observing that if the army remains in its present bivouac for another two weeks , by spring we will not have one healthy man left
1	they looked at her now , it seemed , with still greater perplexity than before
1	she comes in , curtseys , you can fancy , still in a short frock—an unopened bud !
1	you do not know , dmitri prokofitch , that marfa petrovna 's dead !
1	she led him to the dark drawing room , and pierre was glad that nobody could see his face
1	why was he going into that , what 's in his mind , eh ?
1	that 's why she needs to have man over her , that 's why she was created a subordinate being
1	potemkin frowned and smiled at the same time
1	the guests went on being amazed , whispering and exchanging glances , but it became perfectly clear that it had all been calculated and arranged beforehand , and that now nastasya filippovna—though she was , of course , out of her mind—would not be thrown off
1	what does my hair matter !
1	something very bad for me ?
1	and therefore , in order to explain in what way the submission of millions followed from their relations , that is , how from components equal to one a there followed a resultant equal to a thousand times a , the historian must necessarily allow again for the same force of the power which he denies , recognizing it as the result of forces , that is , he must allow for the unexplained force acting upon the composite
1	he walked down slowly and deliberately , feverish but not conscious of it , entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him
1	it was a pleasure to look at her face , as kind , bright , and pure as an angel 's
1	balashov remembered the words—that not a single armed enemy remains on russian soil—but some complex feeling held him back
1	i was walking in the street , out there at the corner , about ten o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front
1	do you want some tea ?
1	he took the cloth off it , and the harp gave out a false sound
1	yes , that is what i love him for , razumihin , exaggerating it all , muttered to himself , with a vigorous turn in his chair
1	and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand , which would have been noticeable
1	in fact , i feel it strange myself how timid , chaste and modern she is with me !
1	this memory of the small details of life struck the doctor
1	the loaded-down pavel pavlovich stood in the middle of the room , as if undecided , with a long , drunken smile on his drunken face ; but at velchaninov 's repeated menacing cry , he suddenly started bustling about as fast as he could , moved the table aside , and , puffing , began to spread and smooth out the sheet
1	then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written , accompanied by a signature and a seal , and presented it to the man , who had shown signs of repugnance too prematurely
1	do you think , then , madame , felton replied in the same grave voice , though with a gentler accent , that i believe i have the right to hinder a creature who is bowing down before her creator ?
1	he had become so completely absorbed in himself , and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting , not only his landlady , but anyone at all
1	he exclaimed , trembling as if in fever and with flashing eyes
1	her vengeful and proud mind was aroused in the highest degree
1	i was silent and concentrated , attentive and terribly calculating ; i was patient and stingy and at the same time decided in decisive moments
1	but will my prayer help him if he 's already condemned ?
1	d'artagnan had turned away to hide his ill humor
1	the feeling of domination and possession
1	ah , queen of heaven , holy mother !
1	but if she came to invite us , why did she start treating mama that way ?
1	i only wish everyone could be as happy as i am
1	that will be … proper !
1	we will see each other tomorrow
1	but if they come ?
1	and so , as i was looking at the sky , this girl suddenly seized me by the elbow
1	but what day will the ball take place ?
1	he urged on his already tired horse so as to get quickly past these crowds , but the further he went , the more disorderly the crowds became
1	they are my enemies , they are all criminals , to my mind
1	pidorka made a vow to go on a pilgrimage ; she collected the property left by her father and a few days later was indeed no longer in the village
1	and he decided to separate from her , at once , whatever the cost
1	but all the same he often told about the sovereign , about his love for him , letting it be felt that he was not telling all , that there was something else in his feeling for the sovereign that not everyone could understand ; and he shared with all his soul the general feeling at that time in moscow of adoration for the emperor alexander pavlovich , who in moscow at that time was given the nickname of angel in the flesh
1	came the dashing voice of the company commander
1	he was met , too , by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback ; he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight
1	he was wearing a straw hat and a white waistcoat with a gold chain , and looked more like a landowner than a dealer
1	nothing come along you shall be witness
1	suddenly he went off completely
1	in one place one hears of a student 's robbing the mail on the high road ; in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes ; in moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets , and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history ; then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain and if this old woman , the pawnbroker , has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society—for peasants do not pawn gold trinkets—how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society ?
1	thus , it is perfectly well known to us that in the course of those two weeks the prince spent whole days and evenings with nastasya filippovna ; that she took him with her for walks , for concerts ; that he went for rides with her every day in the carriage ; that he would begin to worry about her if he did not see her for only an hour ( which meant that , by all tokens , he sincerely loved her ) ; that he listened to her with a quiet and meek smile , whatever she might talk to him about , for whole hours , saying almost nothing himself
1	everybody ’ s been waiting for you , everybody ’ s only been waiting for your happy wit …
1	pierre stood looking at the sisters for a while and , bowing , said :
1	nikolenka was overcome by terror and woke up
1	you see , it 's ten years since i visited petersburg
1	one tormenting impression would not leave him : those broad-boned , reddish hands , with hair showing from under the cuffs , those hands which he loved and hated , and which held him in their power
1	i am too strong not to stop when i want to
1	may i give him a bone ?
1	she then slammed the door and left
1	the air one breathed was sad , damp , and chilly
1	the sovereign said straight out that the council and the senate were estates of the realm ; he said that the government should be based not on arbitrariness , but on firm principles
1	drink ’ s to blame , of course
1	seeing ganya , he smiled venomously and whispered to himself : so there !
1	nothing more is needed , he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table
1	i am frightened of the children 's crying , too for if sonia has not taken them food i do not know what 's happened !
1	but this celerity was of little use to him
1	take care , milord , for now you are in god 's hands
1	it is hard to make anything out in the darkness
1	something 's the matter with her
1	it certainly did seem possible , so violently was he shaking it
1	those who met him in the street felt an involuntary fear
1	he heard wings beating against the glass of the church windows and their iron frames , heard claws scratching iron with a rasping noise and countless powers banging on the doors , trying to break in
1	the study was nothing to her , and she had painted it only so as to have a further pretext for calling on the artist
1	) , but varvara ardalionovna , i think , realized that they had to clear out quickly , and that this was more than enough from aglaya ivanovna , and she dragged her brother away
1	on entering , ivan ivanovich , after bowing in all directions , usually installs himself in the choir and sings along very well in a bass voice
1	in september , during the early stages of planning the novel , he notes : in the first person it would be much more original , and show more love ; also , it would require more artistic skill , and would be terribly bold , and shorter , easier to arrange ; moreover , it would make the character of [ the adolescent ] as the main figure of the novel much clearer and a little further on : a narrative in the first person is more original by virtue of the fact that the [ adolescent ] may very well keep skipping , in ultra-naive fashion to all kinds of anecdotes and details , proper to his development and immaturity , but quite impossible for an author conducting his narrative in regular fashion
1	what have you done ?
1	neither do i , said athos
1	i assure you i am proud of these breeches , and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light , summer trousers of grey woollen material
1	he saw before him an ugly , wrinkled , tear-stained face , beside it another face , an old woman 's , toothless , with a sharp chin and hooked nose , and above them the fathomless sky with racing clouds and the moon , and he cried out in terror
1	i wrote a story—it was not published
1	the next day was spent in preparations for departure
1	he made no answer
1	it is too , too important , too important !
1	the thing is that i keep pacing , pacing , pacing
1	do you still say your prayers , rodya , and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer ?
1	he , too , took his cap
1	who is this , nastasya ?
1	the terrible vengeance when petro died , god summoned the souls of the two brothers , petro and ivan , for judgment
1	the young man stepped into the dark entry , which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen
1	maybe she ’ ll answer … believe me , only in the utmost , the very utmost case , would i turn to … who else can i send it with ? … it ’ s very important … it ’ s terribly important for me …
1	when they passed the farmstead , and a smooth hollow opened out before them , and the coal-black forest spread out to one side , only then did he say to himself : oh-oh , this is a witch !
1	then he gave a prolonged yawn , opening his mouth as wide as possible
1	i cringed all over
1	instead of moving horses and hussar backs , he saw the immobile earth and stubble around him
1	the more so as i am dolgoruky and not versilov
1	it 's not simply that he did not believe me , she said , lowering her eyes and smiling somehow strangely , but he decided that i had 'all vices ' in me
1	this happiness is for those who do not have what you have
1	oh certainly , as much as you like !
1	the rochelois thus had no hope except in buckingham
1	they talked about what pierre had told them
1	rothschild became all alarmed and ran ahead of him
1	he raised his eyes , looked earnestly at them all , smiled , and took his cap
1	but since your purse is quite empty now , allow me to offer you these twenty-five roubles to begin with
1	rodya has given me leave
1	maybe a thousand pistoles
1	and you ’ re not , of course ?
1	the doctor and the priest have been , all as it should have been
1	if i had done that thing , i should certainly have said that i had seen the workmen and the flat , raskolnikov answered , with reluctance and obvious disgust
1	and his serenity does know you , after all , and would receive you graciously
1	the sun shone straight in his eyes , so that it hurt him to look out of them , and he felt his head going round—as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day
1	and if you must examine me , do so in the proper form !
1	somebody 's had real luck to get so much stuff for his caroling !
1	the usually calm face of bilibin was troubled
1	the weaver 's wife wanted to respond in kind , but instead spat into the unshaven chin of the headman , who , in order to hear better , had edged right up to the quarreling women
1	pierre took out his notebook and began to read
1	but there was absolutely nothing in it even faintly resembling such an incoherent dream
1	somewhere far away , it might be in the gateway , two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting , quarrelling and scolding
1	on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling ; but no one noticed him and no one met him
1	cried m de tréville
1	as soon as rostov heard the sound of that voice , a huge burden of doubt fell from his soul
1	who could believe that this sufferer would resurrect ?
1	the actor recited , the artists painted , the cellist played , the singer sang , and at half-past eleven , unfailingly , the door to the dining room would open , and dymov , smiling , would say :
1	his small , deep-set eyes always looked out directly and merrily
1	it seemed to him that something extraordinary had happened , which had destroyed everything all at once , and that he himself had almost been the cause of it by the mere fact of this reading aloud
1	so he got his sight back !
1	and again she immersed herself in reading
1	they never spoke to each other informally but always with respect , as afanasy ivanovich and pulkheria ivanovna
1	only one who loves can remember so well
1	it seems everything has already been thought through , and there 's nothing now that is capable of stirring my mind
1	come along , come along !
1	cried ilya petrovitch from his place , where he , too , was looking through papers
1	i did not remember either getting undressed or going to bed
1	his dwelling itself was unlike all the other little wooden houses
1	what were its causes ?
1	earlier , at exactly ten o ’ clock , while still in bed , at the moment of waking up , the young ladies had a cup of coffee
1	pierre got up and walked away from his new comrades , between the campfires , to the other side of the road , where he was told the captive soldiers were camped
1	the host was alone and sitting at his desk , one of the drawers of which was half open
1	but that 's not the point
1	she looked at me with such eyes that my heart stopped …
1	as a legitimate son , pierre will get everything
1	why do you do it ?
1	it 's a violent crowd , your excellency
1	suddenly he bent over and quietly began to collapse onto kolya ’ s arm
1	there was a lot of empty laughter
1	many times i asked myself how i , a braggart and a liar , could manage not to speak to them about my knowledge—of which they , of course , had no notion—not to wish to astonish them with it , if only out of love for them ?
1	he was of firm character , an honest , direct , even crude man , covered on the outside with a somewhat tough bark , not without a certain pride in his soul , who spoke of people at once sharply and condescendingly
1	the prince asked with a sort of extraordinary surprise
1	the three musketeers who told you there was a woman here ?
1	we sat down facing each other in the middle of the room , at his enormous writing table , and he gave me an already finished fair copy of his letter to versilov to read through
1	he had settled in here , grown accustomed to it , relished it ; he ate a lot , washed in a bathhouse , gained weight , was already at law with the commune and both factories , and was very offended when the peasants did not call him 'your honor
1	the fellow cried victoriously
1	they embarked on their ventures as a whole gang or in parts
1	no , sir ; that same night it disappeared from under the chair , sir
1	aglaya gave the presumptuous brat a terrible look , but kolya did not wait and left
1	but suddenly some little figure turned up beside pseldonymov and started bowing
1	i will do them a good turn , and they will berate me still more ; nothing will be accomplished , except that a great rumor will spread
1	official duty is one thing but you are thinking i meant to say friendship is quite another ?
1	it 's still bearable at our battery , said the adjutant
1	however a beauty 's cloak may flutter behind her , i shall never follow curiously after her
1	what if it 's me ?
1	he will die immediately
1	with especial readiness , the now completely recovered engineer thundered his consent in a bass voice
1	he looked at the yellow and tattered paper , at the dust , at his sofa
1	husband and wife are one flesh
1	i remembered the other
1	petya , forgetting himself , clenched his teeth , rolled his eyes out wildly , and rushed forward , working with his elbows and shouting hurrah !
1	here milady had left the wood and climbed into the carriage
1	and so it will be unto ages of ages
1	all evening nikolai paid most attention to a blue-eyed , plump , and sweet-looking blonde , the wife of one of the provincial officials
1	life 's gone to hell !
1	on coming home in the evening , he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary visits or rendez-vous at appointed hours
1	and karl pulled him away from the window by his coat , and it is true , mr captain , he tore sein rock
1	tikhon began to scratch his back with one hand , his head with the other , and suddenly his whole mug stretched into a beaming , foolish smile , revealing the missing tooth ( for which he was nicknamed shcherbaty—gap-toothed )
1	i would thrash all these orphans
1	he will suffer if he is sorry for his victim
1	and how do you look at the sin of suicide , makar ivanovich ?
1	i got up and left
1	the swedes—their destiny is to be ruled by mad kings
1	they went out to the porch and to the stable
1	glancing through the door , rostov saw sick and wounded men lying there on the floor , on straw and overcoats
1	good morning , darling olga semyonovna !
1	but natasha herself needed to see a doctor
1	i babbled these last incoherent phrases when we were already in the street
1	he was waiting for sonia ; he saw that they were parting , and that sonia was going home
1	the actor is told to undress and wash off his greasepaint and rouge : there is no more need for him
1	maybe i yearned to fall at her feet , or maybe i wanted to give her over to every torment and quickly , quickly prove something to her
1	first , it will show your delicacy , and second , you will also be allowed to lie in return - two enormous profits at once
1	liza , who loved so strongly , must have suffered very much
1	she kept begging him
1	here , rodya , sit up
1	there are even more horrible criminals than this one , who have killed ten people and do not repent at all
1	the first thing he did was to wipe his blood‐stained hands on the red brocade
1	and all those high-ranking fathers of theirs , all those who fidget in all directions and worm their way into court and say they are patriots and this and that : income , income is what these patriots want !
1	she looked him over attentively
1	cried one of the new‐comers ; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw
1	first of all , i will not and can not judge anyone
1	nastasya filippovna glanced fleetingly at the general and also smiled to herself
1	after reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish
1	only what kind of work was there , except for the factory ?
1	the officers stood up
1	attention has been refreshed , and i can go on
1	as you asked , so i answered , he replied , with a surprising expression of simplicity
1	but you have provided for the children of katerina ivanovna
1	his wife is an amazing woman ; i keep whipping her up , convincing her to go and study
1	indeed , it had a certain resemblance to the inside of a coffin , and i even marveled at how correctly he had defined it with a single word
1	mother , you did fortune-telling yourself said the daughter
1	that proves that one of them is at home
1	after alpatych and the coachman , ferapontov 's entire household came out
1	since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere !
1	that 's what comes of having diamonds , my dear master , athos said disdainfully
1	anatole went up to him and began saying something to him , looking and pointing at the rostovs ' box
1	some years later , in , gogol wrote a letter to his father confessor in which he declared himself guilty and cursed not only for having portrayed the devil , which he had done with the intention of mocking him , and not only for having painted nothing but grotesque images , being unable to describe a positive character properly , but first of all for having attemped to re-create each thing as alive as a painter from life
1	that is , again , there were no quarrels , but there was silence and—and a more and more bold look on her part
1	rogozhin had not come back ; no one opened to his ringing ; he rang at old mrs rogozhin ’ s ; they opened the door and also announced that parfyon semyonovich was not at home and might not be back for some three days
1	he brought avdotya romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her a chair
1	i am wounded , i can not mount a horse , and therefore can not command an army
1	they were having a noisy , loud , merry time for themselves
1	he once told , for instance , a chapter three recent story about a discharged soldier ; he was almost a witness to this event
1	or who are you going to shave so early ?
1	turmoil even ensued , but that was just what marya nikitishna wanted
1	on the contrary , but there 's a sort of dignity
1	what things people will imagine !
1	thank you , prince , eccentric friend of our house , for the pleasant evening you have provided for us all
1	now he is setting up for being advanced , not that he has an inkling of anything , but , of course , i encourage him
1	the vegetable oil in the shop is bitter , rancid , the people 's tar is better
1	four shots replied to them at almost the same moment , but they were better aimed than those of the attackers : three soldiers were killed outright , and one of the workers was wounded
1	lebedev came in at last , having only just returned , and , noticing the twenty-five-rouble note in keller ’ s hand , he winced
1	the cellar rats will swim out , and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys
1	looking at her closely , he saw at once that she was completely drunk
1	( aniska was a dressmaker in the country , one of our former serf girls who had been trained in moscow , a pretty wench )
1	he was noticeably in very low spirits
1	i do not know your excellency i had no men , your excellency
1	well , good evening , good evening , je vois que je vous fais peur , sit down and tell me about it
1	through the female side , i believe ?
1	she went to the sitting room , stood , thought , and went to the maids ' quarters
1	and you may be sure , my dear boy , that i love you very much
1	the long one and his comrade also came in with us , despite lambert 's words
1	i don ’ t care a whit about it
1	he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose , but did not yet take it out altogether , simply holding it in his right hand under the coat
1	schiller found it extremely vexing that an unknown , uninvited person had suddenly hindered them so inopportunely
1	if you get anywhere , i declare you are the devil himself !
1	with a low bow , she offered it to kutuzov
1	but , devil take it , you know yourself you are just babbling
1	athos always carried the key to this casket with him
1	it struck him as strange and grotesque , that he should have stopped at the same spot as before , as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts , be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him so short a time ago
1	i believe it will come on to rain
1	we just went hunting and had some fun with the lads
1	you ’ re talking out of a book again , kolya , observed adelaida
1	oh , the scoundrels , the scoundrels !
1	they were all such young , even such underage people , that one could marvel both at the occasion and at the whole ceremony that proceeded from it
1	from insomnia and as a result of the intense struggle against mounting weakness , something strange is happening to me
1	in that case , tatyana pavlovna suddenly abandoned the door , in that case— settle it between you as you like
1	at the end of the court , the corner of a low , smutty , stone shed , apparently part of some workshop , peeped from behind the hoarding
1	but i will add seriously now : if , in the accumulation of wealth , i should reach the same figure as rothschild , then it might indeed end with my flinging it to society
1	and he darted down into the saloon below
1	i am too old for her why do not you speak ?
1	the procureuse went towards the basin of holy water ; porthos got there ahead of her , and , instead of a finger , put his whole hand into it
1	said the prince and sat down at the table
1	one after another , they rush to demonstrate their nonentity to him
1	no , aglaya , no , i ’ m not crying , the prince looked at her
1	i remember two things like these too , a silver one and a little ikon
1	i was in love with boris , with my teacher , with denisov , but this is not the same at all
1	london is far from paris , very far , and maybe the commission you are entrusting to me is not without its dangers
1	one image succeeded another
1	the room ivan ivanovich entered was completely dark , because the shutters were closed , and a ray of sunlight , passing through a hole made in the shutters , turned iridescent and , striking the opposite wall , drew on it a colorful landscape of rush roofs , trees , and the clothing hanging outside , only all of it inverted
1	it was about six o'clock
1	there is a son serving in the provinces , but he does not help ; there is a daughter , who is married , but she does not visit them
1	what an excellent man !
1	it is not for nothing that one is twenty years old , and above all that one is born in tarbes
1	father , father , he cried , father , what are they doing ?
1	with veneration rather than filial feeling , i leaned on his breast and kissed his flowing silver hair
1	the impulse was so strong that she might have died , or so at least it seemed to the prince
1	the count wanted to leave , but hélène begged him not to ruin her improvised ball
1	he spoke softly , measuredly , placing his hands behind his back and looking down
1	you have heard it , and we will all do our duty
1	it 's a good twenty-five years , i think , since i have been to the cemetery ; a nice little place !
1	dyudya 's second son , hunchbacked alyoshka , lives in his father 's house
1	you do not know what you ask ; you are like a child !
1	even as it was , everyone he met seemed to stare and look round , as if they had nothing to do but to watch him
1	finally , yesterday , in the course of one day , i did not manage to figure it out , despite all the indications
1	she met the father and daughter especially courteously and took them to the princess
1	liza 's married to andrei ( a better husband would seem hard to find these days ) , but is she pleased with her fate ?
1	when the pit was all filled , a command was heard
1	for all the twenty minutes of his visit , the prince was even very pensive , almost absentminded
1	they pad themselves quite openly with some frou-frou behind , to show that they are belles-femmes
1	excuse me , i ca not come right now , i am busy with dasha
1	so , then , do not you need a horse first of all ?
1	yakov made good , sturdy coffins
1	it was hot , uncomfortable , and it seemed to him in his sleep that he was not in taunitz 's house and not in a soft , clean bed , but still in the zemstvo cottage , on hay , hearing the witnesses talking in half-whispers ; it seemed to him that lesnitsky was nearby , fifteen steps away
1	you can see very well that it 's all profit
1	but pierre considered it necessary to ask :
1	look at you , fat mug , baring your teeth
1	only aglaya , who had allowed herself so much in her lecture , was not abashed in the least , she even seemed glad
1	the boys at the counter fell to sniggering
1	rostov , preoccupied by his relations with bogdanych , stopped on the bridge , not knowing what to do with himself
1	i wo not leave it like this !
1	you can understand a great deal
1	no need to explain that !
1	pavel pavlovich sat down and filled his glass
1	authors write very funny plays nowadays
1	and you certainly will have to go and thank them ; we will go every day if you wish
1	the old man ’ s getting rabid … mother ’ s howling … by god , varya , say what you will , i ’ ll throw him out of the house or … or leave myself , he added , probably recalling that he really could not throw people out of a house that was not his
1	you must not make a disturbance
1	i can hardly imagine her now with a chapter seven different face , and yet once she was young and lovely !
1	what a beautiful , what a saintly soul !
1	when dounia returned from her last interview with her brother , she had found her mother already ill , in feverish delirium
1	the countess , who had just dozed off , said , waking up
1	the main thing is that from the very first , though she tried to hold back , she threw herself to me with love , she would meet me with rapture when i came home in the evening , told me in her prattle ( the charming prattle of innocence ! )
1	besides , what is this fantasy that medicine has ever cured anybody killed , yes !
1	god , death , love , the brotherhood of men , he said to himself , connecting vague but joyful notions of something with these words
1	sometimes i left the house and wandered about somewhere till late in the evening
1	there 's an element of attraction here , brother
1	i defy your eminence to prove it , cried m de tréville , with all his gascon frankness and all his military gruffness , for an hour earlier m athos , who , i confide it to your majesty , is a man of the highest quality , did me the honor , after dining with me , of conversing in my hôtel drawing room with m le duc de la trémouille and m le comte de châlus , who happened to be there
1	i burst into the front hall by force
1	she told me that a deed of gift from the late stepan kuzmich
1	i expect i look as if i came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way
1	ah , my god , my god !
1	as i understand your life now , you will always remember it with pleasure , because the self-sacrifice by which you live now
1	nobody did see him , razumihin answered with vexation
1	well , now , young man , he said to him , it seems we are putting in some long nights !
1	they are industrious , commercial people ; 'the happiness of all ' is their case
1	how some people are able , how they manage to maintain their dignity !
1	she will be my nurse
1	oh , naturally , recalling my whole paradoxical and devil-may-care mood then , i would , of course , have gotten out of it by some most noble impulse , or catchy little word , or whatever , but i suddenly noticed a spiteful , accusing expression on liza 's frowning face , an unfair expression , almost mockery , and it was as if the devil pulled at my tongue : you , madam , i suddenly addressed her , seem to visit darya onisimovna frequently in the prince 's apartment ?
1	no doubt such a woman can be found , milady said coldly
1	we see it ’ s your mother and sister , rogozhin said through his teeth
1	heavens said ivan ilyich , and even with pleasure he took and crushed between his fingers a single walnut
1	and to her , too , it seemed that he was thinner , weaker , and more insignificant than anyone , and she no longer remembered that he was a bishop , and she kissed him like a child very near and dear to her
1	her mother was already very sick then and nearly dying ; in fact , two months later she did die ; she knew she was dying , but even so she never thought of being reconciled with her daughter till her dying day , never spoke a single word to her , chased her out to sleep in the front hall , gave her almost nothing to eat
1	these mr know-it-alls are occasionally , even quite frequently , to be met with in a certain social stratum
1	at the same time and swift as lightning , the unknown man drew his
1	i said somewhat timidly
1	dessales allowed himself to address him with a question
1	i , however , succeeded in
1	it was quiet everywhere , and one could clearly hear the rustling and tramping of the french troops , already beginning to move and take up their positions
1	then , taking the glass in one hand , she said : drink , drink—this wine will give you strength
1	kutuzov , frowning , glum , was sitting on a bench by the bridge and playing in the sand with his whip , when a caleche noisily galloped up to him
1	hello , pseldonymov , recognize me ?
1	the moon had left the yard and stood behind the church
1	can it be that he has such a love of destruction and chaos ( it 's indisputable that he sometimes loves them very much ; that is a fact ) because he is instinctively afraid of achieving the goal and completing the edifice he is creating ?
1	answered one of the two horsemen
1	kutuzov did not always ride a white horse , holding a field glass and pointing at enemies
1	after that , she grew up , scrofulous and sapless , under the crutch of her lame and drunken parent , amid a bedlam of household gossip , spying , and calumny
1	if they denounce you , they will betray themselves !
1	he 's lost a trick here
1	enough , madame , said porthos , let us speak no more of that , i beg you
1	she looked at me and sat down
1	i know this dog
1	by the way , asked m de tréville , what 's become of your three companions ?
1	who did you ask ?
1	yes , indeed , i am quite surprised at him to‐day , began zossimov , much delighted at the ladies ' entrance , for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes
1	i foresaw he would change his mind !
1	nobody can know the relative strength of the troops
1	he shouted , bringing his fist down on the table
1	he 's better , said the host
1	the father and mother spoke no further with their son about this matter ; but several days later the countess summoned sonya to her and , with a cruelty neither of them expected , reproached her niece for luring her son away and for ingratitude
1	she assured razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman , that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it
1	i must find out ; i absolutely must find out !
1	there wo not be later , but at present there is confound it !
1	one , very fat , in a white silk dress , sat apart on a low stool with a piece of green cardboard glued to the back of it
1	vasya , the messenger boy in afanasy ivanitch 's shop , is better dressed !
1	the funeral and burial are tomorrow , he 's already lying in his little coffin , sir
1	so you know , and that 's wonderful , and so go to her
1	he began to speak more loudly , obviously so that everyone could hear him
1	but , liza , what about you ?
1	since we had made peace and quarreled with bonaparte , we had made constitutions and unmade them , yet the salon of anna pavlovna and the salon of hélène were exactly the same as they had been—the one seven years earlier , the other five years earlier
1	maybe i will go to see her , and maybe not
1	on guard then , monsieur , on guard !
1	let 's go to bed
1	indeed , against his will he is called by certain accidents from non-being into life
1	it 's not really that i came to drink wine
1	it explained everything to me , everything , but as long as she was near , before my eyes , i hoped irresistibly and was terribly happy
1	that 's as it should be , they tell us
1	the same happened with his lawyer ; and yet the lawyer had something to tell him : he had settled the lawsuit quite adroitly , and the adversaries had come to a peaceful agreement , with a very insignificant part of the disputed inheritance as compensation
1	even his own , perhaps too complacent , consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances , seeing that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé
1	her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever , and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home
1	i reproached myself for something and tried to think about other things
1	in my opinion , he did not know himself , but he certainly would have shot her if we had not pushed his hand away
1	shouted one of them , a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot
1	the resurrector , the former hero , flinging himself like a mangy , shaggy mutt at his lackey , who just laughs at him !
1	why are you standing there , stupid girl , winking at the office boys ?
1	because she 's afraid of compromising you
1	thus he had his musketeers as louis xiii had his , and these two rival powers were seen in all the provinces of france , and even in all foreign states , selecting men for their service who were famous for great strokes of the sword
1	ah , rodion romanovitch , is that you ?
1	he surely wo not want to lean over and slurp them up like noodles , and it 's not the right way—a dumpling has to be dipped in sour cream first
1	at four-thirty he lit the candle again and this time saw the black monk , who was sitting in the armchair near the bed
1	so it has been till now and so it will always be
1	let it stay there a while , and later i will take it out
1	now it remains to find out if fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the trouble of risking four heads
1	i admit it openly—for one may as well make a clean breast of it—i was the first to pitch on you
1	hold that mad woman !
1	they thought i would write chief clerk so-and-so at the very bottom of the page
1	no , it would be shameful to be afraid of it
1	at esau 's mess of pottage , the punishment of sodom , and the ordeals of the little boy joseph , she grew pale and opened her blue eyes wide
1	spring was only just beginning , and the real luxuriance of flowers was still hidden in the hothouse , yet what blossomed along the walks and here and there in the flower beds was enough so that , strolling in the garden , you felt yourself in a kingdom of tender colors , especially in the early hours when dew sparkled on every petal
1	the weaver 's fat wife babbled , standing in the middle of the street amidst a crowd of dikanka women
1	and allow me , my dear sir , for my part , to point out to you , ivan fyodorovich , having lost all patience , suddenly said vexedly , that my wife is here visiting prince lev nikolaevich , our mutual friend and neighbor , and that in any case it is not for you , young man , to judge lizaveta prokofyevna ’ s actions , nor to refer aloud and in my teeth to what is written on my face
1	people go from west to east , killing their own kind , and this event is accompanied by words about the glory of france , the baseness of england , and so on
1	they said she was having a romance with some princeling in a village there
1	excuse me , she said
1	well , people shouted , rushed from the ferry , tried to pull him out , but the current was swift , it carried him away , and when they pulled him out he was already dead—drowned
1	and these pictures appeared before her with such clarity and detail that they seemed to her now a reality , now the past , now the future
1	four chinks came into our yard , bringing firewood or something—i do not remember
1	moreover : then , you say , science itself will teach man ( though this is really a luxury in my opinion ) that in fact he has neither will nor caprice , and never did have any , and that he himself is nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ ; [ ] and that , furthermore , there also exist in the world the laws of nature ; so that whatever he does is done not at all according to his own wanting , but of itself , according to the laws of nature
1	he angrily clenched and ground his teeth
1	possibly , indeed , he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone
1	it began very long ago—when i fled abroad for the last time
1	he said that he had forever bound himself by his word , but that he did not want to bind natasha and gave her full freedom
1	lord save us , lord protect us !
1	servants ran to and fro in a flurry
1	besides , how not show a little condescension to a husband whose wife has given you a rendezvous that same evening at saint-cloud , across from m d'estrées 's pavilion !
1	these four horses are equipped for campaigning
1	i went outside feeling somehow especially cheerful
1	but the need to seek causes has been put into the soul of man
1	but the humble air of piskarev , who clung fearfully to a column , was enough to show that he was utterly at a loss
1	the assistant asked him about something else
1	i do not know what would happen to him if natasha did not keep him on a leash
1	going down the huge , steep , and crooked hill that led out of the town , past the cathedral that stood on the hill to the right , in which a service was going on and the bells were ringing , pierre got out of the carriage and went on foot
1	true , thousands of men will have paid for my happiness with their lives ; but what will that matter to me , provided i see you again !
1	and i had a nice card ready
1	two hours went by
1	svidrigaïlov , too , might be a means of escape ; but porfiry was a different matter
1	i thought i should amuse you with my chatter , and i believe i have only made you cross
1	first he asked her for a job , to enter the service , then he started complaining about me , my husband , and you especially … said all kinds of things
1	you read remarkably well !
1	several men came around the corner , talking animatedly
1	all were excited and did not understand one another
1	listen he may marry anna andreevna !
1	i even noticed very well that , generally , at the fanariotovs ' , they must have been somehow ashamed of versilov ; i noticed it , however , from anna andreevna alone , though once again i do not know if one can use the word ashamed here ; anyhow , there was something of the sort
1	nikolai could not refuse iogel and asked sonya to dance
1	no , no , no , stone sober !
1	what sort of girl am i ?
1	it , too , was being done up ; there were workmen in it
1	the right trace horse lunged into the collar , the high springs creaked , and the body rocked
1	but i will tell you what i have been thinking to myself of late , on my way here in the train , especially : did not i contribute to all that calamity , morally , in a way , by irritation or something of the sort
1	through an agent ; my name wasn ’ t mentioned , nor was my address
1	after the first feeling of perplexity that berg 's proposal aroused in the parents , the festivity and joy usual on such occasions installed themselves in the family , yet the joy was not sincere , but external
1	she was trembling in a real physical fever
1	he bore these remarks quietly , however , and , without looking round , he turned down a street leading to the police office
1	in inviting me to stay with you , you wanted to catch me in your nets ; you calculated that i wanted to be revenged on the prince
1	and what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner ?
1	he muttered , helplessly sitting on the sofa again
1	said planchet , who had seen his master blush and pale successively
1	confound it , he went on almost aloud
1	and so , as you see , my dreams have come true
1	i do not want to , i ca not sleep , what am i to do ?
1	vos grenadiers ont été superbes , tonnerre de dieu
1	and ganya laughed spitefully
1	there 's no denying that raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously , but no facts had come to light as yet ; there was nothing positive
1	i asked her like a sensible woman to invite people , especially those who knew my late husband , and look at the set of fools she has brought !
1	it was he who noticed that the diphtheria had passed into the nose
1	porthos lived in an apartment of vast size and sumptuous appearance on the rue du vieux-colombier
1	this room was still smaller and narrower than the previous one , so that i did not even know where to turn in it ; a narrow single bed in the corner took up terribly much space ; the rest of the furniture consisted of three simple chairs heaped with all sorts of rags and a very simple wooden kitchen table in front of an old oilcloth sofa , so that it was almost impossible to pass between the table and the bed
1	perhaps he is repentant before the hour of his death ; only his sins are not such as god will forgive
1	later i asked an officer , and he said that was exactly right
1	irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations , he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them
1	she 's a millionaire bride , said mme peronsky
1	the old prince paced his study , stepping on his heels , and sent tikhon to marya bogdanovna to ask what news
1	let us commend ourselves and all our life unto christ our god
1	each drop strove to spread and take up the most space , but the others , striving to do the same , pressed it , sometimes destroying , sometimes merging with it
1	crowds of officers surrounded him
1	no one could say he had ever been seen at any party
1	he was heard at the council of war and will be heard when he talks to the point ; but to drag our feet and wait for something now , when bonaparte is afraid of a general battle more than anything—is impossible
1	it is not for sorcery , not for deeds of apostasy , that the sorcerer sits in the deep cellar
1	lizaveta prokofyevna turned to him
1	she had been pale to begin with , but when she heard these words , her face changed and something lit up in her luminous , beautiful eyes
1	if you repent of the way you have behaved with me , the young girl who hands you this letter will tell you how a gallant man may obtain his pardon
1	suddenly aglaya came out on the terrace ; she looked calm , though somewhat pale
1	it ca not be a line , because they are in a bunch !
1	it would seem that you , as an artillerist , ought to set an example , and here you are bootless
1	i ’ ve even happened to think sometimes , the prince went on very seriously , being genuinely and deeply interested , that all people are like that , so that i even began to approve of myself , because it ’ s very hard to resist these double thoughts ; i ’ ve experienced it
1	i do not know why , but the sight of those two tables piled high with books gradually began to infuriate me
1	avdotya ignatievna exclaimed with rapture
1	and have you ever seen a shade before ?
1	when they brought me from russia , through various german towns , i only looked on silently and , i remember , i didn ’ t even ask about anything
1	raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly
1	give this good news to your sister , my dear cousin
1	guffaws and squeals came from all over the regiment
1	the old woman is of no consequence , he thought , hotly and incoherently
1	after a pause , he added : but preserve these gloves , gentle brother , that they not adorn unclean hands
1	if only you would help your mother !
1	it 's a splendid aim and all ; but in the present circumstances , something else is needed
1	he looked at her strangely
1	yes , i am a bit ill
1	how do you know it ?
1	so please do come for dinner , he said
1	my late grandfather 's aunt used to say that he was vexed with her the most , precisely for having abandoned the former tavern on oposhnyanskaya road , and he tried with all his might to vent his anger on her
1	perhaps she avdotya romanovna could not finish
1	that the renewal , so to speak , of things
1	to his first knocking there was no response
1	d'artagnan flattened himself to his horse 's neck , in order to see without being seen
1	and even this trifling sum is beyond me
1	kutuzov rode along , falling asleep and waking up and trying to hear if there was gunfire to the right , if the action had begun
1	why , she 's pretty , he said , drawing himself up and looking at her
1	the coroner thought listlessly , watching the outrunner working his legs
1	things to be seen to
1	moisei ilyich is sending me again
1	what for many years past he had feared more than anything was being shown up and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to petersburg
1	maybe it 's precisely the means of seduction that struck him most of all
1	she was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place
1	what drove you to tell him ?
1	as soon as aglaya got the hedgehog , she put it into a wicker basket with kolya ’ s help , covered it with a napkin , and started asking kolya to go at once and , without stopping anywhere , take the hedgehog to the prince on her behalf , with the request that he accept it as a token of her profoundest respect
1	you are right , said felton , after looking at milady from where he was , without taking a step towards her
1	tomorrow , or tonight perhaps , i will see him again , and then the past will no longer exist
1	but there ’ s no need , at least insofar as i ’ m acquainted with your affairs , the general went on hotly
1	not knowing why himself , he announced directly that he would not go
1	but once i reached early manhood , i became a bit calmer for some reason , though with every passing year i learned more and more about my terrible quality
1	but we have calculated it all , dounia and i , to the last penny , and we see that the journey will not cost very much
1	what is it , nicolas ?
1	in spite of all his agonising inward struggle , he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans
1	white , white as that birch , and gallant , you might say , noble fellows
1	and our little tea table ?
1	i suddenly remembered that on the day when nastasya egorovna had come to see me , i had let slip to her that i did not know where lambert lived , but in the sense that i did not know and did not want to know
1	ah , how terribly i lied !
1	in fact the author ’ s absence from russia can be felt in the book , if we compare it with his preceding novel , crime and punishment ( ) , which is so saturated in place , in the streets , buildings , squares , and bridges of petersburg , that the city becomes a living participant in events
1	i do not want it , said raskolnikov , pushing away the pen
1	how good it would be to know where to look for help in this life and what to expect after it , there , beyond the grave !
1	instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life , she gave the simple facts—that is , his own words , an exact account of his health , what he asked for at their interviews , what commission he gave her and so on
1	everywhere is darkness , not a ray , not a spark , but chekhov goes forward , slowly , hardly , hardly moving
1	four men took hold of the hussar and began to lift him up
1	only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have ; so you must be mad
1	however , maybe i would not have given it to her , because i would have been very ashamed to confess to her then that i had it and that i had been watching her for so long , waiting and not giving it to her
1	he has convictions , firm ones , rather clear
1	but let 's stop arguing , we will never see eye to eye , because i place the least perfect of all little libraries and first-aid kits , which you have just spoken of with such scorn , above all the landscape paintings in the world
1	he fell down before her , he kissed her feet and both wept , embracing
1	to the question of what constitutes the cause of historical events , a different answer presents itself , which is that the course of world events is predestined from on high , depends on the coincidence of all the wills of the people participating in those events , and that napoleon 's influence on the course of those events is only external and fictitious
1	he cried in sudden fury
1	for thirty years i have been a beloved professor , have had excellent colleagues , have enjoyed honorable renown
1	i am leaving this minute !
1	he remembered however , that on coming out on to the canal bank , he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous , and he had thought of turning back
1	the boldness of it !
1	in my opinion , each of us has the right to have his own feelings if it 's from conviction so that no one should reproach him for them , i addressed vasin
1	once she got to talking with her friend natasha about sonya and about her unfairness towards her
1	say at once : 'ivan fyodorovich !
1	after tea , varka stands in one spot for a whole hour , looking at the guests and awaiting orders
1	at least i remember him once murmuring somehow strangely , with that air of worldly squeamishness he repeatedly allowed himself with me , that my mother was a person of the defenseless sort , whom you do not really fall in love with—on the contrary , not at all—but for some reason suddenly fall to pitying , for their meekness , is it , or for what , anyhow ?
1	i feel weak , dounia , i am very tired ; and i should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself
1	all who live in it try to mimic and mock one another
1	maxim ivanovich obeyed : i cheated foma that time
1	reason expresses the laws of necessity
1	but the law of history relates to man
1	do you remember i defended them here ?
1	pierre knew that everyone was only waiting for him finally to say one word , to cross a certain line , and he knew that sooner or later he would cross it ; but some incomprehensible terror seized him at the mere thought of that frightful step
1	it seemed he was trying to forget that former life and was interested only in his case with the provision officials
1	but to‐day , to‐day it 's all cleared up
1	pyotr petrovitch began getting up from his chair
1	the grandson of the heroes portrayed in the picture portraying a russian family of the average upper-class cultivated circle over three generations and in connection with russian history—this descendant of his forebears could not be portrayed as a contemporary type otherwise than in a somewhat misanthropic , solitary , and undoubtedly sad guise
1	good-bye , i have no time , liza cut me off , and i suddenly saw so much hatred in her fleeting glance that i at once cried out in fright : liza , dear , why that look ?
1	but how to put it into words ?
1	he was shouted at a couple of times for being in the way
1	why , he had seen lizaveta afterwards !
1	the soul is immortal which means , if i will live forever , then i also lived before , lived for the whole eternity
1	always before , whenever i actually imagined to myself how i would be buried in the grave , my only association with the grave proper was the feeling of dampness and cold
1	so then so then , pack our things , planchet , and let 's be going
1	the stuff 's no good
1	but that 's all nonsense , and on the surface
1	it was told of him that during that month he had supposedly become incomparably more reasonable , even more stern , was no longer frightened , did not weep , and in all that time never once uttered a single word about anna andreevna
1	he closed his eyes and it seemed he slept , but twice he heard the clock strike and father sisoy cough on the other side of the wall
1	how is it you have no notion of anything ?
1	he asked if the russians were still there
1	towards four o'clock in the afternoon , murat 's troops were entering moscow
1	go and tell liza
1	but the thought was painful : if things are well with him , he won ’ t come , the prince went on thinking , he ’ ll sooner come if things are not well with him ; and things are probably not well …
1	that other was your father , polya ; papa was fearfully angry is the water ready ?
1	they were expecting her husband to arrive
1	i am only saying one thing , general , that if the matter depended on my own personal wish , the will of his majesty the emperor franz would have been fulfilled long ago
1	cried the blacksmith , and how will you like this ?
1	tatyana pavlovna picked up
1	yes , yes , let them come at once ; it 's nearly eight o'clock , and at nine i expect a visit
1	in revenge he up and married me to you a huntsman to a cow girl
1	this was the freshness and naivete dostoevsky was seeking , a sense of the world and the person being born at the same time
1	why , i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies
1	as far as i could conclude , the guest , despite his amiability and seeming ingenuousness of tone , was very stiff and , of course , valued himself enough to consider his visit a great honor even for whoever it might be
1	gavrila ardalionovich was starting out precisely in that line ; but he was only starting out
1	wait , when you have not the strength to live , and yet you must live and want to live !
1	sire , me permettrez-vous de vous parler franchement en loyal militaire ?
1	ask them yourself and perhaps you will find out foo !
1	that is another significant moment of reticence on myshkin ’ s part
1	cried porfiry with a perfectly good‐humoured , sly and composed face
1	my wife has escaped ?
1	porfiry petrovitch went on , looking round the room
1	but if i do not recognize any judgment over me , i know all the same that i will be judged , once i have become a deaf and speechless defendant
1	but he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful , shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her
1	if we take what might seem the most traditional of gogol 's tales—the terrible vengeance , for example , or viy ( which gogol calls a folk legend and claims to retell almost as simply as he heard it ) —we will see that their procedure is precisely antitraditional
1	he intimidated him , that 's what
1	but confound them all now !
1	i remember , towards the end we became terribly merry
1	how true it is !
1	we are trying to establish a community of our own , a special one , on a broader basis
1	the preparations for the funeral dinner at katerina ivanovna 's excited his curiosity as he passed
1	alphonsine , not a step from the house !
1	i will let you know , however
1	so the summer went by
1	asked aramis , seeing what was happening
1	the house with the mezzanine : an artist 's
1	for having coffee to drink , and being well fed ?
1	they live well , but it 's impossible to save , what with the family , sir
1	i am sorry , too , that with all the energy and resolution in protesting—which she has already shown once—she has little self‐reliance , little , so to say , independence , so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas
1	there was faith , hope , love
1	do you know that ?
1	exactly three weeks after his last evening at the rostovs ' , prince andrei returned to petersburg
1	that it actually was rogozhin himself , and not a vision , not delirium , i at first did not doubt in the least
1	where 's his head pointing ?
1	whom did she send ?
1	and each time he passed , the young man had a sick , frightened feeling , which made him scowl and feel ashamed
1	asked aramis , with that gentleness of expression which was noticeable in him each time his thoughts led him back to the church
1	dounia understood it , snatched up the key , flew to the door , unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room
1	do not be angry at the boldness of a desperate man , at a drowning man , for daring to make a last effort to save himself from disaster
1	the guests began to disperse , but few went home : many stayed the night in the captain 's wide yard ; still more cossacks fell asleep , uninvited , under the benches , on the floor , by their horses , near the barn ; wherever a drunken cossack head staggered to , there he lay and snored for all kiev to hear
1	that is … i know a lot
1	oh , nonsense , you knew , you knew beforehand ; maybe even yesterday …
1	the fact of a father was nothing , and i disliked tender feelings , but this man did not want to know me and humiliated me , while all those years i had dreamed long and hard of him ( if one can say that about dreaming )
1	why , weren ’ t you asking seriously ?
1	i do not sleep at night until dawn , and that for a year now
1	and those tears a moment ago , which , like an ashamed woman , i could not hold back before you , i will never forgive you !
1	listen , you say he does not like to show his feelings , so perhaps i shall annoy him with my weaknesses ?
1	how can you not know that ?
1	natasha , cautiously opening the door , peeked into the room
1	marfa petrovna you have got rid of marfa petrovna , too , so they say ?
1	at that the conversation ended
1	lxiv : the man in the red cloak athos 's despair had given way to a concentrated grief , which made the man 's brilliant mental faculties still more lucid
1	monseigneur , the musketeers , when they are not on duty , or their duty is over , drink and throw dice , and for their lackeys they are very superior officers
1	and he began ringing at the bell , all but broke it
1	then sensuality was quickly born , sensuality generated jealousy , and jealousy—cruelty
1	and he seems to be quite sick himself
1	the man exclaimed , as if boasting that it had happened
1	he did not think about karataev , who grew weaker every day and obviously would soon be subjected to the same lot
1	and here the enemy will devastate you
1	meanwhile katerina ivanovna apparently heard nothing
1	not only is it encountered at every step , but all the descriptions of the general historians are made up of a consecutive series of such contradictions
1	i thought precisely that about her then , with pride and with joy , because there was magnanimity in it : on the verge of ruin , yet goethe 's great words still shine
1	and now i want to carouse , i ’ m a streetwalker !
1	to pierre 's question of what he must do and how to answer , willarski said only that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre need do nothing more than tell the truth
1	princess marya felt insulted in her sense of her own dignity , because the arrival of the promised suitor excited her , and she was still more insulted that her two friends did not suppose it could be otherwise
1	where is the money !
1	it was to this important person that our akaky akakievich came , and came at a most unfavorable moment , very inopportune for himself , though very opportune for the important person
1	you wanted to take revenge on me for something just now , swore to ruin me , and certainly would have killed or beaten anyone who uttered even one bad word about me in your presence
1	tie a string round your finger , then
1	here people danced precisely in simplicity of heart , to make merry and even get wild
1	after eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street , with my orphans !
1	i thought it was luzhin 's present , observed raskolnikov
1	it was also impossible to suppose that they feared a denunciation to the police ; for what could the police do here ?
1	c'est pour vous que je dis cela , monsieur kiril
1	when our charabanc stops at the gate , he does not conceal his joy and impatience
1	razumihin broke in upon her thoughts , guessing them , as he strolled along the pavement with huge steps , so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him , a fact he did not observe , however
1	oh , papa , what 's the matter with you , you do not understand !
1	to that end , he took on the valet of one of his master 's guests , named fourreau , and that false soldier who had wanted to kill d'artagnan , and who , belonging to no corps , had entered into his service , or rather planchet 's , since d'artagnan had spared his life
1	the doctor 's coarse , peasant face gradually lights up with a smile of tenderness and delight at the movements of the human spirit
1	you , though , how do you look at this renunciation ?
1	the priest 's wife , with dimples on her red-cheeked , smiling face , followed him into the room
1	should be here shortly
1	here on the terrace like yesterday ?
1	show us the new carriage your master acquired recently
1	he ’ s obviously very absentminded now , and hard to make out ; he talks , tells stories , laughs , guffaws , then suddenly gets terribly angry with me , i don ’ t know why , sir
1	all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience
1	if he had shrieked in a desperate voice , that shriek would have terrified princess marya less than the sound or that voice
1	the officer timokhin , with a little red nose , was wiping himself on the dam and , seeing the prince , became embarrassed , yet ventured to address him :
1	tell us , did you not yet know of the countess 's death when you stayed in moscow ?
1	he slammed the door , summoned mlle bourienne , and quieted down in his study
1	he made haste to turn them all over
1	well , yes , yes , said the regimental commander , still one must pity the young fellow in his misfortune
1	rostov understood that the old man meant to ask him something
1	seeing this she did not pull the door back , but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs
1	but not all those present were drunk ; lodgers came in from all the rooms
1	but he , though he was a good man , became so bewildered and even frightened at the mention of money , that he came out with the most unexpected rubbish
1	however , there are railroads everywhere in europe now , and steamships drive very fast
1	the masters are leaving , the whole house is empty , said the old woman , addressing the old servant
1	finally , at around half-past ten , the prince was left alone ; he had a headache ; the last to leave was kolya , who helped him to change his wedding costume for house clothes
1	they repeated to him their first question , which he had told them he did not want to answer
1	the news of this letter affected the old prince maybe several times more strongly than she part three or any of us had supposed
1	have you asked her to join your community ?
1	incidentally the murder of lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis : a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open !
1	naked as the poorest wretch , writes isabelle jan , but masters in faithfulness , rapidity , and effectiveness , they are indeed demigods
1	his two companions were already waiting on horseback
1	the horse , puff , puff , is quite a decent one !
1	and look at the ground again
1	at least they discussed it together
1	and he could be silent like that for several hours , without experiencing in himself or causing in others the slightest embarrassment
1	would you like me to finish ?
1	what , you still do not believe me ?
1	his hair was soaked with sweat , his quivering lips were parched , his eyes were fixed on the ceiling
1	never would i have stooped to such a stupid conversation with anyone else
1	the cossacks bowed on all sides and stood in a cluster
1	in the military respect , napoleon , as soon as he enters moscow , gives general sébastiani strict orders to keep track of the movements of the russian army , sends corps to various roads , and orders murat to find kutuzov
1	and as a result of that , when they sat for him , they sometimes acquired such expressions as astonished the artist : one tried to make her face show melancholy , another reverie , a third wanted at all costs to reduce the size of her mouth and compressed it so much that it finally turned into a dot no bigger than a pinhead
1	at the council , in opposition to the opinion of the old men—kutuzov and prince schwarzenberg—it was decided to go on the offensive immediately and give general battle to bonaparte
1	since then i ’ ve had a terrible fondness for asses
1	and what was the meaning of this face that he was afraid of and that he loved so much !
1	will you explain what you want ?
1	but since that story of the lapdog on the train three years ago , my relations with our porthos , epanchin , have been definitively terminated
1	thank you , monsieur , replied mme bonacieux
1	but when he was on the semyonovskoe heights , the artillery commander had suggested placing several batteries on those heights to increase the fire on the russian troops crowding before knyazkovo
1	it so happened that he also wanted terribly much to do versilov a good turn , to make , so to speak , a first step , and versilov allowed it
1	though boris had come with the intention of speaking of his love , and therefore intended to be tender , he began speaking irritably of women 's inconstancy : of how easily women could go from sadness to joy , and that their mood depended only on who was courting them
1	avdotya romanovna flushed , but did not break the silence
1	said the young woman , pressing her hands together and weeping at the queen 's distress herself
1	nothing to do but read it , taras tikhonovich , said the judge , addressing the secretary with an air of displeasure , and his nose inadvertently sniffed his upper lip , which previously it used to do only from great pleasure
1	the solitary shot of a signal gun rang out , and the troops that surrounded moscow on all sides moved into the city through the tver , kaluga , and dorogomilovo gates
1	you would be more comfortable staying somewhere with us , even
1	i knew perfectly well that liza used to visit mrs stolbeev and later occasionally visited poor darya onisimovna , whom they all came to love very much ; but suddenly , after this , incidentally , extremely sensible statement from the prince , and especially after stebelkov 's stupid outburst , or maybe because i had just been called prince , suddenly , owing to all that , i blushed all over
1	yet it 's a known fact that a great many of those who are capable of contemplating their imminent death , self-willed or not , are quite often inclined to be concerned with the handsome appearance in which their corpse will be left
1	gentlemen , said d'artagnan , whose wits never deserted him , gentlemen , think it over !
1	you want to go there with us , too ?
1	what a fine sight we will be on those nags , while aramis and porthos go prancing along on their horses !
1	people laugh , dogs bark
1	i wanted forcefully to subject myself and to be faithful to nature , soullessly , having stifled everything
1	besides a general feeling of alienation from all people , natasha experienced at that time a particular feeling of alienation from the persons of her own family
1	cried dounia , in vexation
1	so i went along and thought : no , i ’ ll wait before condemning this christ-seller
1	what may we offer you , ivan ivanovich ?
1	a coachman , after shouting at him two or three times , gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip , for having almost fallen under his horses ' hoofs
1	and i see you are an intelligent man too
1	have you the papers ?
1	he gazed for a long time , thrusting his head out the vent
1	his estate turned out to be in order and , besides that , there turned out to be quite a considerable capital
1	whatever is young and honest , they destroy !
1	it was considered closed , but went on working secretly , with the knowledge of the district police officer
1	have not you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg ?
1	swarthy and fair , tall and short , some fat as ivan nikiforovich , some so thin it seemed each of them could have been put into the police chief 's scabbard
1	they were separated by an empty space of about six hundred yards
1	ganya , before the moment when they all got up from the table , had suddenly stopped drinking and pushed his glass away ; something dark had passed over his face
1	if i call , he said , come
1	the inhabitants were leaving , the retreating troops were filling moscow
1	i am lost , d'artagnan said to himself
1	i am not the point
1	tolstyakov , a friend of mine , is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps
1	that 's just the point , that the ordinary man would unfailingly behave that way
1	mixed with the memory of that young girl was the memory of wrath , and a desire for vengeance had distorted milady 's features , which , however , recovered almost at once the calm and benevolent expression that this woman of a hundred faces had momentarily lost
1	there 's nothing more pleasant than to owe everything to oneself
1	they may be of use some time
1	does that mean you have reasons to be ?
1	yes : the diamond pendants his majesty gave the queen
1	will you still say , discreet aramis , that you are on bad terms with mme de bois-tracy , when the gracious lady is kind enough to lend you her handkerchiefs ?
1	yes , sir , your honor , the soldier said with pleasure , rolling his eyes and drawing himself up still more zealously , but not budging from his place
1	d'artagnan responded in such a way that kitty remained in the greatest delusion
1	you do not get money every day ?
1	how would he find athos ?
1	he was extremely angry
1	why are you annoyed ?
1	yes , that 's right , milord , that 's right , in the left side with a knife
1	for half an hour or more i went on explaining in an even little voice , looking down like a well-behaved boy
1	you see , lukyan timofeich , it would be a terrible thing to be mistaken
1	that 's how it is with us , meaning no offense to you !
1	you are a terrible laugher , just like me wait she seized the countess by both hands , kissed the knuckle of her little finger—june—and went on kissing july and august on the other hand
1	shouted denisov , who could not stay still and fidgeted on his horse in front of the squadron
1	you ca not get on without us
1	of course , it 's hard to understand , but it 's like a gambler who throws his last gold coin on the table and has a revolver ready in his pocket—that 's the meaning of his proposal
1	understandably , it seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by the intrigues of england ( as he said , in fact , on the island of st helena [ ] ) ; understandably , to the members of the english parliament it seemed that the war was caused by napoleon 's love of power ; to prince oldenburg it seemed that the war was caused by the violence done him ; to the merchants it seemed that the war was caused by the continental system , which was ruining europe ; to the old soldiers and generals it seemed that the chief cause was the need to make use of them ; to the legitimists of that time , [ ] that it was necessary to restore les bons principes ; [ ] and to the diplomats of that time , that it had all happened because the alliance between russia and austria in had not been concealed skillfully enough from napoleon and because memorandum no
1	and , of course , my brother never thought for a moment that he was guilty of her death
1	blood was flowing from his head and face ; his face was crushed , mutilated and disfigured
1	set him next to his wife : a real tomfool !
1	i wish they would laid one like him next to me !
1	how do you do , your excellency , he said to the entering anatole , and held out his hand again
1	she asked , looking up at him across the table
1	one can quite understand it but how could you have lowered yourself to such an action ?
1	if there was any , we did not understand it , or else it was not witty at all , said the expressions of the marshals ' faces
1	each time the reading goes on uninterruptedly for several hours without tiring him
1	spirid went on : he would spot a rabbit quicker than you could take a pinch of snuff
1	it should be realized that this certain important person had become an important person only recently , and till then had been an unimportant person
1	how could you go and leave your poor olenka , poor , wretched me ?
1	but he did not believe a word he said , though he felt a strange inclination to believe
1	could live a little !
1	during the entr'acte there was a gust of cold in hélène 's box , the door opened , and anatole came in , ducking his head and trying not to snag on anyone
1	but in order to comprehend the laws of the continuous movement of the sum of all individual wills , human reason allows for arbitrary , discrete units
1	as they were going downstairs , d'artagnan slapped the chief on the shoulder
1	but the other one needs it more
1	at this amalia ivanovna , lashed to fury , struck the table with her fist , and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna , and not ludwigovna , that her vater was named johann and that he was a burgomeister , and that katerina ivanovna 's vater was quite never a burgomeister
1	it seemed to evgeny pavlovich that he and adelaida had not yet become completely close with each other ; but the future seemed to promise a completely willing and heartfelt submission of the ardent adelaida to the intelligence and experience of prince shch
1	this other man wore a tailcoat , was over forty , and had a preoccupied physiognomy , and was the special office attendant and announcer to his excellency , owing to which he was conscious of his worth
1	we do not mention the old times at all ; she receives me very willingly , but speaks to me somehow abstractly
1	every woman is a serpent , and every serpent is a woman !
1	earlier you suddenly said something very intelligent
1	the conversation was evidently a continuation of their previous arguments during the week ; but into it , to my misfortune , there again slipped that same fatal little phrase that had so electrified me the day before , and it led me to an outburst that i regret to this day
1	what , at five years old ?
1	but a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained
1	but rostov took leave of the doctor and asked the assistant to accompany him
1	there 's some mistake in words here , from the very beginning , and 'love for mankind ' should be understood as just for that mankind which you yourself have created in your soul ( in other words , you have created your own self and the love for yourself ) , and which therefore will never exist in reality
1	he held out both hands to me , but he did not give me one—he drew it back in time , struck him suspiciously
1	you turned a bit crude , my friend , wherever it was that you grew up , but , anyhow , you are still decent enough
1	to me it also seems that there 's something wrong here
1	i must tell you that i would heard of this stupid story before you wrote and do not believe a word of it
1	this task is possible only if we stop arbitrarily substituting for the value of the whole unknown x the conditions under which force is manifested—to wit : the orders of the commander , armaments , and so on—taking them for the value of the multiplier , and recognize this unknown in its entirety , that is , as the greater or lesser desire to fight and subject oneself to danger
1	i believe it is real ah , i remember ; i must escape !
1	his relations even published in the newspapers that they were not answerable for his debts , but he continued his carousing even now , obtaining money at ten percent a month , gambling terribly in the gambling houses , and squandering all he had on a notorious frenchwoman
1	how do you know ?
1	and she had almost guessed right : in essence i actually felt something of that sort at the time
1	once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle , then gently , as though reflecting and looking about him , began touching the door‐handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook
1	the little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that
1	as you know , i came up from the ranks
1	when he came to a streetlight , some ten steps ahead of me , i noticed that something fell out of his pocket
1	prodigiously , said athos , clenching his teeth
1	drink the tea , swallow it—never mind if it burns you ; life 's dearer
1	i dare say i do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash ; but you must not think me selfish or grasping for that , and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes
1	and here is why
1	it 's my last request of you
1	never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine
1	ivan fyodorovich sat on his chair as if on needles , blushing and looking down ; but the young lady seemed not to notice it at all and sat indifferently on the sofa , studying the windows and walls diligently or following with her eyes a cat that timorously ran under the chairs
1	the three musketeers oh , yes !
1	i made the acquaintance of nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch , and the house‐porter and mr
1	i declare to you that there were grounds for your suspicions : this document exists that is , it did
1	i began showing him to the stairs with a candle ; the landlord also jumped over , but , in secret from versilov , i seized his arm with all my strength and shoved him away fiercely
1	those standing behind noticed the things that the orator did not say and hastened to say them
1	ivan ivanych quickly glanced into the shed and said :
1	and in general i ’ d advise you to keep to the family you ’ re going to be with
1	do you know what we are eating here ?
1	give me a little kopeck !
1	well , go on , go on— my dear friend !
1	i stayed , but with a look which showed every second that i was terribly afraid of being in their way ( as was proper )
1	in this lane there were high stone walls on both sides , for almost a hundred paces—the enclosures of backyards
1	[ ] you will see everything best from where count bennigsen is
1	katerina clasped her hands and fell like a sheaf on the dead body
1	tell me about it , tréville ; you know how i love stories of war and combat
1	so when you stand and pray before you go to sleep , add at the end : 'and have mercy , lord jesus , on all those who have nobody to pray for them
1	it was a sad prospect
1	this stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious , brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor
1	last year i had no need of it , but this year i resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived
1	what made me think , he reflected , as he went under the gateway , what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment !
1	that 's the way to eat them
1	what do you mean to do now ?
1	this is our neighbor , mama , ivan fyodorovich shponka !
1	and again he was transferred to his former artificial world of phantoms of some sort or greatness , and again ( as a horse walking about a slanting treadmill imagines it is doing something for itself ) , he began to obediently fulfill that cruel , sad , oppressive , and inhuman role which had been assigned to him
1	do you know krylov ’ s fable , your excellency : the lion and the ass ’ ?
1	for instance , it was sinful to work on sundays and holidays , monday was an unlucky day , and as a result in one year there was a total of about two hundred days when he had , willy-nilly , to sit with folded arms
1	ippolit is her brother
1	it was as if he suddenly came out of some sort of dream , almost embarrassed ; he took a letter from a briefcase that lay on the table and gave it to me
1	i understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate , but who is proud , imperious and above all , impatient , to have to bear such treatment !
1	on the twenty-ninth of november , kutuzov rode into vilno—into his good old vilno , as he used to say
1	live like that if you want , and if you do not—go hang yourself
1	and yet , sincerely speaking , i had never seen more bitter and outright grief than when i looked at this unfortunate woman
1	and i did not realize then how happy i was !
1	he explained every incident of the murder , the secret of the pledge ( the piece of wood with a strip of metal ) which was found in the murdered woman 's hand
1	if only there was a seasoned hare running through the field , i would show you what kind of dog she is !
1	imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years ?
1	from the time of this news until the end of the campaign , kutuzov 's entire activity consists only of restraining his troops , by power , cunning , and entreaties , from useless attacks , maneuvers , and clashes with the perishing enemy
1	just as he entered the vestibule , another man also entered , dusty , out of breath , leaving at the door a post-horse which , on arriving , fell to its knees
1	but how do you come to know me ?
1	i have never seen a handsomer man
1	but , precisely because of its originality , chekhov 's work met with opposition from the established critics of the time
1	as soon as the uhlans had gone down the hill , the hussars were ordered to move up the hill to cover the battery
1	many people came to see how she would weep and walk behind the coffin ; then the pastor—he was still a young man and his whole ambition was to become a great preacher—turned to them all and pointed at marie
1	he calls her pashenka !
1	don ’ t they understand that the more oblivious i become , the more i give myself up to that last phantom of life and love with which they want to screen my meyer ’ s wall from me , with all that is written on it so frankly and simple-heartedly , the more unhappy they will make me ?
1	knowing that my wife and daughter are on his side , he sticks to the following tactics : he responds to my barbs with an indulgent silence ( the old man 's cracked , what 's the point of talking to him ?
1	yet time went by , the hours seemed to awaken the clock one by one as they passed , and each stroke of the bronze clapper echoed in the prisoner 's heart
1	i got dressed as quickly as i could
1	suddenly the galosh grows , swells , fills the whole room
1	he muttered , standing aimlessly in the gateway , just opposite the porter 's little dark room , which was also open
1	what then is to be done ?
1	true to his sweet dream ,
1	kindly note , your excellency : everybody else is witty , but i am not
1	with my capital i will throw myself into the 'idea , and in ten years all russia will be talking , and i will have my revenge on everyone
1	you have kissed the queen 's hand ?
1	that 's why i am not anxious to have you take it from me
1	after his meeting with pierre in moscow , prince andrei left for petersburg on business , as he told his family , but in reality in order to meet prince anatole kuragin , whom he considered it necessary to meet
1	i could not speak in the right way
1	raskolnikov had not heard them at first
1	it was as if the main screw in his head , which held his whole life together , had become stripped
1	that is , likhachev couldn ’ t get her for any amount of money !
1	do you think so , porthos ?
1	in five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in
1	there are instances of it with everyone ; human beings in general , indeed , greatly love to be insulted , have you noticed that ?
1	pierre and thirteen others were led to the krymsky ford , to the carriage shed or a merchant ’ s house
1	the letters would be read aloud several times , and the old man , moved , flushed with excitement , would say :
1	let us try to take our revenge
1	he had two sons : sergei and ivan
1	rostov saw how the sovereign 's stooping shoulders shuddered as if a chill ran through them , and how his left foot convulsively began to spur the horse 's side
1	here 's the grocery where we used to buy gingerbread
1	in the end i decided to challenge my adversary to a duel
1	kutuzov made no objections or comments
1	i will read you the first canto ; it 's four hundred verses long and takes one minute
1	the prince jumped up from the chair in new fright
1	all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience
1	evidently ours had begun to respond
1	in this whole part of the province , his uncle had the reputation of a most noble and disinterested eccentric
1	the philosopher flitted into the weeds and broke into a run , constantly stumbling over old roots and crushing moles underfoot
1	soon after prince andrei 's return , the old prince separated his son 's share of the inheritance and gave him bogucharovo , a large estate thirty miles from bald hills
1	you did not drink before coming , or earlier ?
1	but there seemed to be nothing , no trace , except in one place , where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers
1	i am very glad you have come , said kraft
1	the artist must pass judgment only on what he understands ; his range is as limited as that of any other specialist—that 's what i keep repeating and insisting upon
1	and now would you like to look over my estate ?
1	all this happened yesterday evening
1	the hostilities are over , we can shake hands with each other the emperor napoleon is burning with desire to meet prince auersperg
1	at the sight of d'artagnan , he stood up and politely took a few steps towards him
1	kutuzov , leaving his hands propped on the bench , looked at denisov with displeasure
1	the princess nodded to her daughter and sailed towards the door
1	events and time do not wait
1	and what have you done with your curates ?
1	he became suspicious to such a degree that he finally began to suspect his own self , started writing terrible , unjust denunciations , made innumerable people miserable
1	and anna andreevna thinks so , too
1	he said timidly at last in a weak voice
1	[ ] he added , already addressing pierre as his own brother
1	that 's why i have chosen this example , because it is an all too vivid one
1	she gave it to me
1	show him in , said milady , in a voice so curt but so piercing that d'artagnan heard it in the antechamber
1	what was more , she showed and read to everyone the letter in dounia 's own handwriting to mr svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—which i must say i think was superfluous
1	no doubt you do not care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters dounia 's not at home , mother ?
1	but where can you have seen her the day before yesterday ?
1	of course , the funeral !
1	vive le roi de rome !
1	and since you have started to deign , it serves you right , love-child
1	after the death of prince andrei , natasha and princess marya equally felt that
1	at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street , and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing the hamlet were heard in the entry
1	my hand is tired of writing !
1	all the while i spoke of the prince , she listened to me , looking down with a sort of sly but sweet smile : she knew why i was praising him so
1	you are right again , sonia
1	at the very moment she was expected to seize the hare , he swerved and flew out to the boundary between the green fields and the stubble
1	he had already been warned by d'artagnan , who first announced that it would mean glory , then money , and finally danger
1	does she even mean to have a funeral lunch ?
1	but while he stood at the railing , still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage , and rubbing his back , he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand
1	i will ask them again right now , said pierre , and he got up and went to the door of the shed
1	he saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there
1	i have a headache
1	he thought to himself
1	this time it was athos who turned pale
1	she had undertaken to lay the table , to provide the linen , crockery , etc , and to cook the dishes in her kitchen , and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone herself to the cemetery
1	and meanwhile , even in spite of all my desire , i could never imagine to myself that there is no future life and no providence
1	he knew that he was in the power of these people , that it was only power that had brought him there , that only power gave them the right to demand answers to their questions , and that the only purpose of this gathering was to incriminate him
1	in what , essentially , can i be of service to you , my much-esteemed prince , since all the same you have now … summoned me ?
1	he examined the hand , vainly looking for blood on it
1	moreover , it seems my shouting was heard in the reception room , and the talk and laughter suddenly died down
1	[ ] this letter was considered a model of patriotic , spiritual eloquence
1	am i very pale ?
1	what 's going on with her ?
1	the old man picked up an ember , blew it to flame—lighting up only his eyes and nose—then , when the yoke was found , went over to lipa with the light and looked at her ; his eyes expressed compassion and tenderness
1	it is me or luzhin
1	thank god , i took mama away and put her to bed , and there are no new developments
1	yes , it 's all right
1	but i repeat to you for the hundredth time , there is only one case , one only , when man may purposely , consciously wish for himself even the harmful , the stupid , even what is stupidest of all : namely , so as to have the right to wish for himself even what is stupidest of all and not be bound by an obligation to wish for himself only what is intelligent
1	mikhail kirilych has grown still fatter !
1	what will happen to them then ?
1	what word should i begin with , so that they understand at least something ?
1	and what are you painting ?
1	zametov had been sitting in the corner , but he rose at the visitors ' entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips , though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment
1	with my bearing you do not get far !
1	devil take it , is he spying on me , or what !
1	this was the cause of great uneasiness to dounia ; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son 's fate and was afraid to ask , for fear of hearing something still more awful
1	a man with such wishes is deserving of every respect for that alone
1	the proprieties were observed , and the sovereign showed the first example of it ; but everyone knew that the old man was at fault and good for nothing
1	in a strong and rather agreeable voice , cracked and coarsened by street singing , she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop
1	what am i to do ?
1	oh , he did need me , that is , not me but the document !
1	he went into that room—the fourth in order ; it was a small room and packed full of people , rather better dressed than in the outer rooms
1	after the suffering he had endured , prince andrei felt a bliss such as he had not experienced for a long time
1	however unfathomable for us is the cause of the expression of will in any act of mine or others , the first demand of intelligence is the assumption of and search for a cause , without which no phenomenon is conceivable
1	i love you as a brother , and will love you always , and i need nothing more
1	i went into it like a wise man , and that was just my destruction
1	and so it turned out
1	in the hospitals death was such a certainty that soldiers sick with fever and bloated from bad food preferred to go on serving , forcing themselves to drag their feet to the front rather than go to the hospital
1	akhmakov is extremely afraid of
1	after that he wanted to get his freedom
1	she knew him , she knew that on her return after a useless journey , she could argue all she liked about prison , she could make as much as she liked of sufferings endured , the cardinal would respond with that mocking calm of the skeptic who is powerful in both strength and genius : you should not have let yourself be caught !
1	further away , beyond the yard , frogs were croaking and a nightingale sang
1	having listened to this decision , akaky akakievich plodded sadly to his room , and how he spent the night we will leave to the judgment of those capable of entering at least somewhat into another man 's predicament
1	thanks to the sale of his horse , he was beginning his career with four ecus more than m de tréville had begun his with
1	for two or three moments they stood facing each other ; finally something mocking barely showed in her face ; she smiled slightly and walked past him
1	let her strike me , it relieves her heart it 's better so
1	we wo not hold out !
1	the prince , on behalf of his pupil
1	lev nikolaevich , aglaya ivanovna has just given me a little word for you in secret
1	i asked in perplexity
1	almost an hour went by , the tea was finished , and after tea the guests finally felt ashamed to stay longer
1	prince andrei obviously felt awkward ; but for the two women it seemed natural to weep ; it seemed it had never occurred to them that their meeting could be otherwise
1	kolya , all worked up , red-faced , in agitation , went on reading in an agitated voice :
1	and therefore i request that the said gentleman , ivan , son of nikifor , dovgochkhun , being guilty of arson , of insult to my rank , name , and family , and of the thievish appropriation of property , and above all of the base and reprehensible appending to my family name of the appellation goose , have a penalty imposed on him , with payment of expenses and losses , and be condemned himself as a trespasser , put in chains , and taken to jail , which decision with respect to my petition should be handed down at once and without fail
1	on top of that came four hundred roubles—when would he ever save up so much !
1	only the pre-eternal god can decide the fate of the fatherland , papa , said berg
1	besides that , for some reason it seemed to them that their little sister , aglaya ivanovna , might know more about this affair than the three of them , including the mother
1	let 's drop it , said versilov , looking at me strangely ( precisely as one looks at an uncomprehending and unsuspecting man )
1	it seemed to milady , in one of those furtive glances that she cast at the peephole , that she glimpsed the young man 's burning eyes through the tight grating ; but whether this was a reality or a vision , this time he had enough control over himself not to come in
1	he knew that all the words napoleon was now saying meant nothing , that he would be ashamed of them himself once he came to his senses
1	he was almost weeping
1	such is my will
1	there was an abundance of riches and no end of them in sight ; everywhere around the area occupied by the french , there were other areas , unknown and unoccupied , in which , as it seemed to the french , there were still greater riches
1	on going into his hôtel , m de tréville reflected that he ought to steal a march by making the first complaint
1	you have sucked enough of our blood , you herods , a plague upon you !
1	said natasha , turning her head and putting both hands to her hair , which the maid who was holding it did not have time to let go of
1	after performing this test , the physician shook his head and said : no , impossible
1	what do you mean 'so young ' ?
1	velchaninov was forced to jump down ; other vehicles and people pushed him farther back
1	it 's a brutal state to be in !
1	and what the devil do i care about his look ?
1	it 's not true , it 's not true he 's lying i want natasha !
1	the same people , in almost the same positions , were sitting in the anteroom , exchanging whispers
1	but before he finished the verses , the loud-voiced butler announced : dinner is served !
1	you have cross-examined my landlady , i will be bound well , that 's enough !
1	i humbly ask you to give her my greetings , and to remind alexandra mikhailovna … in short , convey to her my heartfelt wish for that which she herself wished for on thursday , in the evening , to the strains of chopin ’ s ballade ; she ’ ll remember … my heartfelt wish !
1	athos followed the road for a while , his eyes fixed on the ground ; slight stains of blood , which came from a wound inflicted either on the man who accompanied the carriage or on one of the horses , marked out the way
1	the sovereign was not dancing ; he stood in the doorway and stopped now one couple , now another , with gracious words that he alone knew how to utter
1	i wo not come in , i have not time , he hastened to say when the door was opened
1	if you say a single word to anyone at all before getting on the ship , my sergeant will blow your brains out—he has orders to do so
1	aglaya replied with haughty indignation
1	out of reverent respect for me , he took me there , believing in the nobility of my feelings—
1	natasha smiled through her tears
1	this is our zemstvo agent then he imagined lesnitsky and the beadle loshadin walking over the snow in the fields , side by side , holding each other up ; the blizzard whirled above them , the wind blew in their backs , and they walked on and sang :
1	prince andrei was one of the best dancers of his time
1	i swear i will shoot again
1	if you want so much to have such shoes , it 's not hard to do
1	les allemands sont de fieres bêtes
1	but why are you so pale , rodion romanovitch ?
1	pavel pavlovich repeated in a tenderly slack voice
1	what is this bobok ?
1	god alone can see and judge my feelings for him , and i do not allow society to judge me for the step i have taken !
1	what sort of melons are they ?
1	go , he said in a low voice , find rochefort for me
1	konstantin mochulsky comments on the shift in emphasis from dostoevsky 's previous novel : as in demons , the action is concentrated around the hero , but the personality of versilov is revealed differently than the personality of stavrogin
1	have you seen him , aunt ?
1	you should have seen the change these words produced in the strange moneylender
1	towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily
1	then suddenly you start reading a whole lecture about all this darkness and the seventy-five thousand
1	the walking men kept the wolves from coming near , so that gray could eat as much as he liked
1	did you receive my hedgehog ?
1	if the porter had asked him , what do you want ?
1	and the weekly review ceased to exist , so that 's why it was not printed at the time
1	he quite calmly walked over me , and i bounced aside like a ball
1	and avdotya romanovna ca not possibly be left in those lodgings without you
1	i will still get them carried away !
1	then for a long time he lived somewhere in the south
1	i knew one eternally laboring man , though not from the people ; he was a rather developed man and able to generalize
1	in our monastery nobody 's interested in them
1	and this simpleheartedness was attractive
1	cried aramis , you are killing me !
1	but as such cries , given their frequency , attracted no one in the rue des fossoyeurs , and , besides that , the mercer 's house had been rather ill-famed for some time , bonacieux , seeing that no one came , went out himself , still shouting , and his voice could be heard moving off in the direction of the rue du bac
1	there must be something wrong here , you have been ringing and pulling at the door and still they do not open !
1	the general had a flourishing family
1	maybe i did take your cross , but i won ’ t kill you for your watch !
1	but although he had almost always been by himself of late , he had never been able to feel alone
1	no , you can ’ t smoke here , and moreover you should be ashamed of having such thoughts
1	in another lane , a sentry standing by a green box called out to him , and only after the repetition of the threatening cry and the sound of the sentry cocking his musket did pierre understand that he should go over to the other side of the street
1	or throw up life altogether !
1	the old woman lay silent all the while with her eyes closed
1	the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed , how could they help laughing ?
1	zametov , left alone , sat for a long time in the same place , plunged in thought
1	arouse the fire of virtue in all hearts
1	the fact is that , in those unfortunate times , one tried hard to surround oneself with men of tréville 's temper
1	i will follow you !
1	but in bringing her into my house , i thought i was bringing a friend , and i needed a friend so very much
1	extreme sadness , the most sincere , the fullest , was expressed in his features
1	to deliver a letter , a petition to his majesty , nikolai said in a trembling voice
1	a carriage that was driving behind the convoy pulled up close to a convoy wagon and punched its shaft through it
1	it was an ordinary summons from the district police‐station to appear that day at half‐past nine at the office of the district superintendent
1	but it was obvious that his thoughts were wandering god knows where , otherwise he would have heard choub hiss when his hair got caught by the rope that tied the sack and the stalwart headman begin to hiccup quite audibly
1	nikolai gave his horses free rein ; zakhar , stretching his arms forward , clucked his tongue and let his own go
1	her kind , weepy face expressed only anxiety and fear
1	so many beautiful children came to us
1	in a suffering , weary voice he was saying something to tikhon
1	he was killed almost in my presence
1	since that same morning when we saw each other last , i have taken a step that not every person can understand and grasp as one with your as-yet-uncontaminated mind , with your loving , unspoiled , fresh heart would understand it
1	but , nevertheless , he by no means believed it was as simple as that ; he had a vague and fearful presentiment of something
1	you ’ re mistaken , general , he said
1	varya flared up , looking contemptuously at her brother
1	what it was that i wanted to tell you then—i have forgotten , of course , and did not know then , but i had a burning desire to see you as soon as possible
1	who wants to go and see him off in such weather !
1	aglaya ivanovna blushed and , believe it or not , was even a bit at a loss , either because i was there , or simply seeing gavrila ardalionovich , because he ’ s so good-looking , but she just blushed all over and ended the business in a second , very amusingly : she stood up , responded to gavrila ardalionovich ’ s bow and to the ingratiating smile of varvara ardalionovna , and suddenly snapped : i ’ ve invited you only in order to express my personal pleasure at your sincere and friendly feelings , and if i ever have need of them , believe me … ’ here she made her bows , and the two of them left—feeling like fools , or else triumphant , i don ’ t know ; ganechka , of course , felt like a fool ; he didn ’ t understand anything and turned red as a lobster ( he sometimes has an extraordinary expression !
1	as he was finishing , the host came back with the requested bottles and a ham which , fortunately for him , had not gone to the cellar
1	and meanwhile his left arm was as heavy as though a twenty-pound weight was hanging from it
1	can you really think i am ashamed of it all , or that it 's all any stupider than whatever there may have been , gentlemen , in your own lives ?
1	keep the lieutenancy , my dear , keep it
1	marmeladov broke off , tried to smile , but suddenly his chin began to twitch
1	she listened to the sound of their voices through the door
1	for god 's sake , captivity again and horsemeat !
1	my god , how he had tormented her !
1	but where can such a lackey be found ?
1	i looked away indifferently
1	other muzhiks , hearing of their comrades ' failure , came to the city with wheat , oats , hay , and beat each other down to prices lower than before
1	the princess let go
1	he was suddenly changed
1	they will be in the street , all of them , she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall , as she did to‐day , and the children will cry
1	no , i consider it empty ritualism
1	it is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught
1	and what are we doing now ?
1	svidrigaïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it
1	the dust , the stuffiness , the white nights of petersburg , which chafed his nerves—this was what he enjoyed in petersburg
1	they made a custom of entering their master 's forests as if they were their own ; they built a lot of sleds and sold them at the local fair ; besides that , they sold all the big oak trees to the neighboring cossacks to be cut down for their mills
1	but spring was coming , it was already the middle of april , the storm windows had been taken down , and bright sheaves of sunlight began to light up our silent rooms
1	everything is deception , everything is a dream , everything is not what it seems to be !
1	loud voices rang out ahead
1	i have got the letter , he said to athos and his friends
1	you surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother ?
1	i was just waiting for her to say that—oh , the truthful one , oh , the sincere one , oh , the honest one !
1	i married this woman when she was a young girl ; i the three musketeers married her in spite of all my family ; i gave her my property , i gave her my name ; and one day i discovered that this woman was branded : this woman was marked with a fleur-de-lis on her left shoulder
1	that 's what betrays him !
1	before half a year went by , i received a highly poetical and rapturous letter , beginning with the words : i am in love
1	all sympathy between us is extinguished
1	indeed , as we have said , the whole camp was stirred up
1	the entire market was completely bought up for this dinner , so that the judge and his deaconess had to eat buckwheat pancakes and cornstarch custard
1	i … i ’ ve come to you … for a human talk
1	alpatych , gliding along , all but running , followed behind rostov , barely keeping up with him
1	zametov will make a scandal in the french style in a house of bad reputation , over a glass of champagne
1	why , yes , arkashenka , yes !
1	je suis gentilhomme avant part three tout et je mourrai gentilhomme !
1	he murmured to himself , almost unaware of his words
1	she lay dead in the same position in which he had seen her five minutes before , and , despite her still eyes and pale cheeks , there was the same expression on that lovely , timid , childish face , with its lip covered with fine black hair
1	on the contrary : if your man is mine , i will have two vengeances at one stroke , that 's all
1	ah , why do such people as you have children ?
1	anya 's eyes still glistened with tears , but she was no longer thinking about her mother , or money , or her wedding , but was shaking hands with some high-school students and officers she knew , laughing merrily and saying quickly :
1	planchet , quite dumbfounded , was in the process of currying them and had already finished two
1	dostoevsky 's devastating attack on the nihilists in demons ( - ) had turned most of the radical intelligentsia against him
1	i could sit it out when they called me a spy and an idiot ; and the further they went in their conversation , the less possible it seemed for me to appear
1	when the prince observed to him that earlier as well it had been the same almost every day , kolya decidedly did not know what to answer to that and how to explain precisely what caused his present anxiety
1	what are you losing your mind for ?
1	how much did you pay per yard ?
1	a sort of sinister feeling finally passed over nastasya filippovna ’ s face ; her gaze was becoming stubborn , firm , and almost hateful , not tearing itself from her guest for a single moment
1	the same is true for moral illnesses
1	for him , milady was no longer that woman of fatal intentions who had frightened him momentarily , she was an ardent and passionate mistress abandoning herself entirely to a love that she herself seemed to feel
1	hit her in the face , in the eyes , in the eyes , cried mikolka
1	the one who bit off the assessor 's ear ?
1	and i loved you , sir , all that year in t—
1	wait , let 's get out and then follow in his tracks
1	besides , it was his definite intention to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies , but without weakness , fearing that the result of the duel would be what is always the most regrettable result in an affair of this kind , when a young and vigorous man fights against a wounded and weakened adversary : vanquished , he doubles the triumph of his antagonist ; victorious , he is accused of treachery and easy audacity
1	lviii : escape i have no time to waste : tomorrow is the twenty-third , and buckingham is leaving tomorrow with the fleet
1	it won ’ t take long to snatch it out !
1	what does 'have not distinguished yourself mean ?
1	napoleon , standing on the barrow , looked through a field glass , and through the small circle of the field glass he saw smoke and people , sometimes his own , sometimes russians , but when he looked again with the naked eye , he could not tell where what he had seen was
1	he was deaf and did not hear prince andrei ride up
1	you should not , dounia i am happy now—simply in seeing you , rodya hush , mother , he muttered in confusion , not looking at her , but pressing her hand
1	it was affirmed ( andronikov is said to have heard it from katerina nikolaevna herself ) that , on the contrary , versilov , still earlier , before the beginning of the young girl 's feelings , had offered katerina nikolaevna his love ; that she , being his friend , and even in exaltation over him for some time , though constantly disbelieving and contradicting him , met this declaration of versilov 's with extreme hatred and mocked him venomously
1	you are a beast , not a man !
1	well , sirs , i am that very same hunchback !
1	and i smiled because because when you guess something , you always smile it was even strange
1	cried the young queen , feigning surprise
1	perhaps it 's the last time i shall speak to you
1	to forestall the french with his entire army was impossible
1	but how can you go in such a state ?
1	the three musketeers so you really love my mistress , monsieur le chevalier ?
1	he would whistle : 'here , robber !
1	and their attitude towards people was the same
1	yes , milord , i accept , said d'artagnan , and if it please god , we will make good use of your presents
1	finally , the latest episode in poland , still fresh in the captain 's memory , which he recounted with quick gestures and a flushed face , consisted in the fact that he had saved the life of a pole ( in general , episodes of saving lives occurred constantly in the captain 's stories ) and the pole had entrusted his enchanting wife to him ( parisienne de coeur [ ] ) , while he himself entered into the service of the french
1	madame , he said in an altered voice , you will receive a visit from m le chancelier , who will communicate to you certain matters which i have entrusted to him
1	said nikolai , once more searching into the expression of his sister 's face to find out if it was true , and , his boots creaking , he jumped off the fender and ran to his sleigh
1	this encouraged the deputy
1	well , off you go , off you go
1	there is no one—no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you !
1	well , then , i am your humble servant , monsieur le baron , said d'artagnan , though your names are quite hard to remember
1	the king said , shaken , so that 's how things went ?
1	they suddenly started saying that i was waiting for you and that i loved you
1	he rolled his dead eyes in all directions and saw dead men rising from kiev , from the land of galicia , and from the carpathians , their faces as like his as two drops of water
1	he said , going out
1	raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor
1	shouts lambert , and the two of them guffaw still more , and my heart sinks : oh , can this shameless woman possibly be the same one at whose mere glance my heart boiled over with virtue ?
1	on the tenth of august , the column of which his regiment formed part drew level with bald hills
1	no , athos picked up with a singular smile , i gave it away during a night of love , as it was given to you
1	the prince is formally her fiancé , the matter ’ s settled
1	there was some other vaudeville with funny verses about lawyers , especially about some collegiate registrar , written quite freely , so that i wondered how it passed the censors , and they said outright that merchants cheat people and their sons are debauchers and try to worm their way into the nobility
1	moreover , the artist turns away from them , finding in them a necessary falsehood
1	[ ] he had picked up a shell splinter that had killed an adjutant standing next to the commander in chief and offered this splinter to his superior
1	no , i was sent the wine in your name
1	on receiving the news of natasha 's illness , the countess , though not quite recovered and still weak , went to moscow with petya and all the household , and the whole rostov family moved from marya dmitrievna 's to their own house and settled in moscow
1	you must hope for the best , and i am sure
1	by the way tell mr
1	an old woman , all bent over and dressed in black , a kerchief on her head , bowed silently and deeply to rogozhin
1	he had overslept himself !
1	i came into this very room
1	lord , how well made !
1	the old servant on my floor comes to ask whether i have bed linen
1	in deathly anguish he waited for the answer
1	he had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation
1	said the count , and the moment he said it , he saw coming around the corner of the house , between two dragoons , a young man with a long , thin neck , half of his head shaved and covered with new stubble
1	how is it you do not understand , finally , catiche ?
1	take a wing , ivan fyodorovich , the other one , with the gizzard !
1	but i maintain that he is not cunning , not practised , and probably this was his first crime !
1	you can reckon on my word
1	the question is this : russia 's salvation lies in the army
1	we ca not go through the hollow—it 's swampy , said the esaul
1	not there , but the room next to it
1	polenka came in holding kolya and lida , who were trembling and weeping
1	i did not want to lie about it even to myself
1	what is the meaning of it ?
1	but sometimes she was unexpectedly overcome not only by the fear of death , but by the fear of illness , weakness , the loss of beauty , and involuntarily she sometimes studied her bare arm , amazed at its thinness , or in the morning contemplated in the mirror her drawn and , as it seemed to her , pathetic face
1	porthos and aramis were trembling with rage
1	ieronym recovered himself and rushed to the cable
1	dymov , in his shirtsleeves , his waistcoat unbuttoned , was sitting at the table and sharpening his knife on his fork ; on a plate in front of him lay a grouse
1	excuse me , said d'artagnan , reappearing from under the giant 's shoulder , but i am in a great hurry , i am running after someone , and and do you forget your eyes when you run , by any chance ?
1	she ’ s afraid to ruin and disgrace you , but me she can marry , meaning it doesn ’ t matter—that ’ s how she considers me , note that as well !
1	if the government offices were evacuated , it was done only on the demand of the officials , with whom the count agreed reluctantly
1	our own stupidity , yakov alpatych , voices responded , and the crowd immediately began to break up and scatter through the village
1	withal not forgetting , out of long habit , to steal an old boot sole that was lying on a bench
1	to stifle his petty feelings , he hastened to reflect that he himself , and khobotov , and mikhail averyanych , must die sooner or later , without leaving even a trace on nature
1	why do you ask ?
1	the floors were strewn with freshly‐cut fragrant hay , the windows were open , a fresh , cool , light air came into the room
1	for it ’ s actually so , we are ridiculous , light-minded , with bad habits , we ’ re bored , we don ’ t know how to look , how to understand , we ’ re all like that , all , you , and i , and they !
1	the fat colonel‐major ( he was really a discharged officer of low rank ) was also absent , but it appeared that he had been not himself for the last two days
1	yours , alexandra ivanovna , is also a beautiful and very sweet face , but you may have some secret sorrow ; your soul is no doubt very kind , but you are not joyful
1	there must be something to it
1	a moment later , the three young men separated , arranging a rendezvous for four o'clock at athos 's and leaving planchet to guard the house
1	she rushed to the furthest corner , where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table
1	something inconceivable , something terrible is happening in our home
1	i have written this down now without being ashamed , because maybe it was all good , despite all its absurdity
1	i thought the prince would keep it to himself and not tell
1	they didn ’ t agree … i kissed marie two weeks before her mother died ; when the pastor gave his sermon , all the children were already on my side
1	raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands , without opening it
1	what were we talking about at dinner ?
1	a dressing room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur
1	he shouted , that 's true , he shouted three times , another voice declared
1	only when people were killed or wounded , he winced and , turning away from the dead man , shouted angrily at his crew , who , as always , were slow to pick up a wounded man or a body
1	yet i still kept going to see him ; i could hardly not go , however , having been drawn into all that
1	who knows , maybe in his sorrow he will make up his mind to fall in love with another girl and out of vexation call her the first beauty of the village ?
1	but his laughter was quickly followed by despair
1	the sergeant major 's come for money
1	he never could have loved a healthy , strong , red-cheeked woman , but pale , weak , unhappy tanya he liked very much
1	and now he felt no fear , he felt nothing
1	and turning on his heel , he was about to go back into the inn through the main gate , under which d'artagnan , on his arrival , had noticed an already saddled horse
1	the thaw was still going on ; a dismal , warm , noxious wind whistled along the streets , carriages splashed through the mud , iron-shod trotters and nags struck the pavement ringingly
1	in short , i do not know precisely what exactly , but do not you know something ?
1	a normal man , it is true , hardly exists
1	i say that i am of porthos 's opinion , replied aramis
1	he turned and went out , and never came again
1	that 's enough , papa
1	tell me , what answer should i give this purebred scoundrel when he asks , 'why should i necessarily be noble ?
1	to his question— would i let sofya semyonovna sit down beside my sister , i answered that i had already done so that day
1	on glimpsing her brother-in-law , she uttered a terrible cry
1	i returned home , and when i announced that i would been taken back into the service and should receive a salary , heavens , what a to‐do there was !
1	but what do you say to this argument ( help me with it ) : ghosts are , as it were , shreds and fragments of other worlds , the beginning of them
1	and her deaf husband , who understood nothing , did not look at her ; he sat with his legs crossed eating nuts , and cracked them so loudly that it was as if he were firing a pistol
1	and he looked at his blushing daughter
1	said dolokhov , and he picked up the cards with a smile
1	two conclusions follow directly from this : first , persistence in accumulating , even by kopecks , produces enormous results later on ( time means nothing here ) ; and , second , that the most unsophisticated but continuous form of gain mathematically assures success
1	such a beginning was no good omen for the end
1	he opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what vengeful purpose he had come , but she added : poor angel , that monster of a gascon nearly killed you !
1	then i don ’ t want to know you !
1	but for our hero this visit contained in itself something even capital
1	your mother is an angelic soul , do you hear , kolya , an angelic soul !
1	he got up and went to sonia
1	i have nothing to do with captain eropegov , don ’ t you agree ?
1	we wo not get up , mother !
1	for a whole month you were silent , making ready , and suddenly—nothing !
1	and he smiled approvingly , obviously glad for the junker
1	-the sun had set long ago
1	dawn was breaking ; the outlines of the barge , the osier bushes in the rippling water , could be seen clearly , and , looking back , there was the clay cliffside , the hut roofed with brown straw below , and a cluster of village cottages above
1	she would begin to say something softly to her from the other end of the room
1	at a single glance , the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details
1	the cold water refreshed him , he dried himself off , and , without saying a word , not even thanking his sister of mercy , seized his hat , took on his shoulders the fur coat held for him by mrs pseldonymov , and through the corridor , through the kitchen , where the cat was already miaowing and the cook , raising herself on her pallet , gazed after him with greedy curiosity , ran out to the courtyard , to the street , and rushed for a passing cab
1	no , i wasn ’ t laughing at you , i only meant to praise you … kolya told me that the prince called you a child … that ’ s good … so , what was i … there was something else i wanted …
1	what 's that nonsense you asked about the fire brigade ?
1	look how he treats the ladies !
1	devil take it , there 's something strange in it
1	let me , pelageya danilovna , i will go , said sonya
1	it seems to me , afanasy ivanovich would say , that this kasha is a wee bit burnt—do not you think so , pulkheria ivanovna ?
1	he said , with the feeling of a russian for whom things are going badly
1	pavel pavlovich exclaimed vexedly , but the young man at once checked him
1	you will answer for it , cried berg , who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the left flank of the infantry of the first army— a quite agreeable and visible post , as berg put it
1	yes , i ’ m unwell , the prince replied distractedly and even impatiently
1	athos alone smiled a strong and scornful smile
1	what can i do with the people ?
1	the viscount said that the duc d'enghien [ ] had perished from his own magnanimity and that there were special reasons for bonaparte 's viciousness
1	he raised himself and sat up
1	never yet had napoleon or any of his generals seen such horror , so many men killed on such a small space
1	the only entertainment for a poor man at the petersburg feast !
1	one lady , who got out of a second-class car and was remarkably pretty , but somehow too magnificently dressed for a traveler , almost dragged with her , in both hands , an uhlan , a very young and handsome little officer , who was trying to tear free of her grip
1	the prince cries : she ’ s yours !
1	i do not know my mother , either
1	that night he woke up before morning among some bushes in krestovsky island , trembling all over with fever ; he walked home , and it was early morning when he arrived
1	he was a young man with a beard , wearing a full , short‐waisted coat , and looked like a messenger
1	but for you and me , brother , it 's time to drop these niceties , dolokhov went on , as if he found a special pleasure in talking about this subject , which irritated denisov
1	vera asked her father impatiently
1	the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out , his eyes contracted , his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh , shaking all over and looking raskolnikov straight in the face
1	you do not think , sister , that i was simply afraid of the water ?
1	the imperial adjutant wolzogen , the same one who , riding past prince andrei , had said that war should be im raum verlegen , and whom bagration hated so much , rode up to kutuzov during dinner
1	he did not lift his arms to embrace them , he could not
1	sergei sergeich also sits rubbing his little hands and occasionally mixes in
1	raskolnikov did not sit down , but he felt unwilling to leave her , and stood facing her in perplexity
1	it is a delight then for the hot sun to look down from on high and plunge its rays into the chill of the glassy waters and for the coastal forests to be brightly reflected in them
1	and maybe they are both cheats ?
1	you are old , too , we will soon see each other in the next world
1	my mother added , noticing something like a smile on tatyana pavlovna 's face
1	however , as i handed her the two roubles , i could not help myself and said as if with a certain irritation : i am doing it only for you , moser would not take such a thing from you
1	they joined forces against him and hanged him from a tree
1	he kissed her hand and addressed her as miss sonya
1	do you know who i have met here ?
1	bazin was stationed in the corridor and barred his way with all the more intrepidity in that , after many years of trial , he saw himself at last about to reach the result he had eternally striven for
1	( and she herself told me once in moscow : you ought to edify yourself at least somehow , at least read solovyov ’ s russian history , you don ’ t know anything at all )
1	it makes me miserable
1	think what you are saying
1	i ca not live like this any longer !
1	gurov cut himself a slice and unhurriedly began to eat it
1	thought rostov , still sensing that smell of dead flesh he had picked up in the soldiers ' section , and still seeing around him those envious looks that had followed after him on both sides and the face of the young soldier with rolled-up eyes
1	of how he gives the madmen haircuts , and how nikita helps him to do it , and what commotion among the patients each appearance of the drunken , grinning barber causes , we will not speak
1	such a woman can be found : the duke is a ladies ' man , and if he has sown much love by his promises of eternal constancy , he must also have sown much hatred by his eternal infidelity
1	marfa petrovna is pleased to visit me , he said , twisting his mouth into a strange smile
1	and it seems to master danilo ( here he began feeling his mustache to see if he was asleep ) that it is no longer the sky but his own bedroom that he sees : his tartar and turkish sabers hang on the walls ; around the walls are shelves , and on the shelves dishes and household utensils ; on the table , bread and salt ; a cradle hanging
1	pulcheria alexandrovna was emotional , but not sentimental , timid and yielding , but only to a certain point
1	pardon me for the trouble , officer , i would reward you , too , for your labors , but you are all on such a noble footing now my dear , he turned to me , there 's an eatery here , in fact a terrible cesspool , but one can have tea there , and i would suggest to you here it is now , come on
1	dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview , that her brother would not be alone
1	and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa , which was in even worse condition than his own , razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill
1	listen to me , rather than contributing to my destruction , rather than contributing to my ignominy
1	she still did not give any reply to his main questions : she was stubbornly silent about everything concerning her former relations with her father
1	do i want it myself ?
1	you have such fine handwriting accessories , and so many pencils , pens , such fine , thick paper … and it ’ s such a fine office you have !
1	on days of battle , soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment , listen intently , look about , and greedily inquire into what is going on around them
1	princess marya did not understand what he wanted from her and what he was asking to be released from
1	that 's annoying , though , chartkov thought to himself
1	he cried in a rage
1	yes , said athos , let 's give the purse , not to our lackeys , but to the englishmen 's
1	but i may be mistaken ; that may only be the part he assumes
1	and now everything scattered at their first meeting and with their first words
1	i only know that the real will is in his desk , and this is a forgotten document she tried to go around anna mikhailovna , but anna mikhailovna sprang over and again barred her way
1	the phrase viva , andrei petrovich !
1	what steeds , if you knew , katerina , what steeds we drove away with us !
1	yes , seriously , i have
1	it was either that i could not hear her breathing in bed , or perhaps i made out in the darkness that her bed was empty— only i suddenly got up and felt with my hand : there was no one in the bed , and the pillow was cold
1	my lodging , he answered , listlessly
1	yes , that meek face was becoming bolder and bolder
1	andrey semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt
1	and the family parted on the most friendly terms
1	blessed is the chosen one who possesses it
1	in the doorway i was almost knocked off my feet by lukerya , who ran swiftly from makar ivanovich 's room to the kitchen
1	after which , naturally convinced that the lady was at home , i went in and , finding no one , began to wait , supposing that tatyana pavlovna would presently come out of the bedroom ; otherwise why would the cook have let me in ?
1	the prince was terribly glad to see him and at once spoke about the epanchins ; such a simple-hearted and direct opening completely unbound evgeny pavlovich as well , so that without preliminaries he , too , went straight to the point
1	she is mistrustful had i better wait a little longer till my heart leaves off thumping ?
1	maybe we were already flying through those spaces
1	you must go to bed at once , he pronounced , examining the patient as far as he could , and take something for the night
1	ah , how nice of you to come , we are so bored here otherwise , another girlfriend said to him amiably , one he had not yet noticed at all , and who appeared from god knows where , a little redhead with freckles , her face flushed in a terribly funny way from walking and the heat
1	and what a drama must have taken place between them then and from what ?
1	the general suddenly said with feeling and warmth , i … and even lizaveta prokofyevna herself ( who , incidentally , began railing at you again , and at me along with you and on account of you , only i don ’ t understand what for ) , we love you all the same , sincerely love you and respect you , even in spite of everything , that is , all appearances
1	come , mamma , come out of the room at least for a minute , dounia whispered in dismay ; we are distressing him , that 's evident
1	but around one-thirty an event took place which no pen can describe
1	i began on that pyramid while still under my child 's blanket , when , as i was falling asleep , i would weep and dream— about what ? —i myself do not know
1	in this farmstead a man often appeared , or , better , a devil in human form
1	i found out that it ’ s all true
1	our two doves were grief-stricken ; and then a rumor spread through the village that some polack had taken to calling on korzh , all trimmed in gold , with a moustache , with a saber , with spurs , with pockets that jingled like the little bell on the bag our sacristan taras goes around the church with every day
1	the prince glanced fleetingly at it , as if recalling something , not stopping , however , wanting to go on through the door
1	there were several moments of silence
1	at some other time , it would be my pleasure , he mumbled , but now
1	everyone fell silent and waited for what he would say
1	and the airy beauty trembled
1	yes , what was it my sister told me about this baby ?
1	on the little table by the head of the bed , the taken-off and scattered diamonds sparkled
1	but the presence of this woman did not keep milady from reflecting
1	the opening night was on february n ,
1	keep on your guard at all times and before all else
1	i am sitting all alone in a strange town , on a strange bed , rubbing my aching cheek with my palm
1	she saw the objects around her and was aware of all that went on around her , but she was unable to form an opinion about anything and did not know what to talk about
1	they all fell silent
1	and it is here , in this void , that chekhov begins seeking new paths
1	dans cette réunion de grands souverains , nous eussions traités de nos intérêts en famille et compté de clerc à maître avec les peuples
1	the doctor and the coroner , followed by the beadle holding the lamp above his head , went into the clean room
1	he said to his daughter
1	the two valets quickly dressed his majesty , and he , in the dark blue uniform of the guards , with firm , quick steps , went out to the reception room
1	and it 's enough that i have come here ill with fever
1	oh , the vileness , oh , the stupidity , oh , the narrowness of these 'rotten , sentimental souls ' !
1	yes , in uniform , but thanks to ah , stebelkov , so you are here ?
1	every decent man of our time is and must be a coward and a slave
1	cried aramis , throwing his calotte in his face
1	my father , whom i told of my plans , made it an absolute condition for his consent that the marriage not take place for a year
1	ivan ivanovich saw the woman already setting her foot on the wattle fence , intending to climb into his yard , when ivan nikiforovich 's voice suddenly rang out : come back !
1	take him straight to the police station , the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly
1	yes , we shall still have happy days !
1	but maybe i just imagined it that way : it 's impossible for a nose to vanish so idiotically , he thought and went into a pastry shop on purpose to look at himself in the mirror
1	all the main things had become clear to me , in spite of this unworthy tangle ; everything i was afraid of—had been confirmed
1	look at what people are saying
1	that innocent blockhead never does see anything !
1	the princess blushed and waved her hands desperately
1	she was wearing a different dress
1	in my opinion , this is in fact called life
1	no , i do not want to trust myself to anyone
1	he whispered , and , taking a glass in his hand , he arose
1	what are you to be pitied for ?
1	and i do apo-lo-gize , my dear and andrei makarovich , the young man began to maunder , approaching me with an extraordinarily casual air and taking hold of my hand , which i was unable to withdraw
1	he responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that
1	have you ever been to nastasya filippovna ’ s ?
1	once again , colonel , the general said , i can not in any case leave half my men in the woods
1	that horrid , military , pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future
1	said balaga , also drinking his glass and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief
1	and this baby in her arms is an orphan , her sister , my daughter lyubov , born in most lawful wedlock of the newly departed elena , my wife , who died six weeks ago in childbed , as it pleased the lord … yes , sir … in place of a mother , though she ’ s only a sister and no more than a sister … no more , no more …
1	natasha had rarely experienced such a joyful feeling as she experienced now , sitting in the carriage next tp the countess and gazing at the walls slowly moving past her of alarmed , abandoned moscow
1	the whole following story about this wedding was told by knowledgeable people in the following way and seems to be correct :
1	so ve old hussars see it , anyvay
1	zossimov has gone , so you must
1	i ran away in a fright , and , besides , the bell rang
1	does it make any difference how the note is worded , count , he said , if the content is strong ?
1	gretchen wants to pray , but only cries burst from her breast—you know , when your breast is contracted with tears—but satan 's song does not stop , ever more deeply it pierces the soul , like a sharp point , ever higher— and suddenly it breaks off almost with a shout : 'it 's all over , you are cursed !
1	we have both reached the limit , and before god 's judgment we are equal in our trespasses
1	to her heart i confided much of what has since been so hideously realised
1	but her family thought the match unequal
1	but i ’ ve gone on too long
1	the guards , under the command of m des essarts , took quarters with the minimes
1	death , which will end everything and which must come today or tomorrow—in a moment , anyhow , compared with eternity
1	i am very sorry for it , my dear sir
1	now that these facts have been made known , it must be clear to everyone that mr burdovsky is a pure man , despite all appearances , and now the prince can , the sooner and all the more willingly than before , offer him both his friendly assistance and the active help which he mentioned earlier , speaking about schools and pavlishchev
1	my father died while he was on trial , the prince observed again , though i could never find out precisely for what
1	i am drowning , i run to you asking for help , and you say to me : drown , that 's how it should be
1	and do you really repent ?
1	the artist observes , selects , guesses and synthesizes
1	for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna , even hunting her out at the bazaar , at every instant called her pani
1	prince vassily knew that and , having once realized that if he were to solicit for everyone who solicited from him , it would soon become impossible for him to solicit for himself , he rarely used his influence
1	the prince had to turn towards liteinaya street
1	dounia , goodness knows whether he will come !
1	when we get to paris , we will still have a good four hundred , said porthos , plus the harnesses
1	why are you going ?
1	never thought of it !
1	you can see for yourself it is
1	leave me , leave me alone !
1	is there anything in it that remotely resembles an event ?
1	what a show the new french ambassador made of himself !
1	and my appearance was all too unseemly
1	i ’ m here under special dispensation
1	then comes that mysterious time when lamps endow everything with some enticing , wondrous light
1	they tried to keep from crying , but many failed and cried loudly , especially the girls
1	( she read loudly , cold and trembling with ecstasy , as though she were seeing it before her eyes )
1	i go down on my knees to you , and i will pray to god eternally for you , take me away from here or i will die
1	and , smiling , he winked at me with his left eye
1	dolokhov said that cossacks were only a fear for stray ones like him and his comrade , but added questioningly that they probably did not dare to attack large detachments
1	you say to me
1	i am so glad you will be getting acquainted
1	you were not on duty today , it was zastupov hired you to replace him
1	i am not one of those tyrants who keep women by force
1	he added , passing his gaze over them all with a sort of defiance , and as if addressing them all indiscriminately
1	i can at least answer for myself …
1	gogol had a different understanding of the artist 's task and of his temptation
1	kutuzov had ordered himself taken around by the back streets to the other side of moscow
1	i agree that it 's a bold thought ( and therefore sweet )
1	pierre looked at the serious faces of the people around him , remembered all he had already gone through , and realized that he could not stop halfway
1	no matter , ilya petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly
1	yes , very interesting , said pierre
1	i like sometimes to descend for a moment into the realm of this remarkably solitary life , where not one desire flies over the paling that surrounds the small yard , over the wattle fence that encloses the garden filled with apple and plum trees , over the village cottages surrounding it , slumped to one side , in the shade of pussy willows , elders , and pear trees
1	well , good-bye , your excellency , be well , said rastopchin , getting up with his peculiarly quick movements and holding out his hand to the prince
1	he covered his face with his hands and fell to thinking
1	if they were all out , they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside
1	the prince cried fearfully , again seeing expressions of offended confusion in burdovsky , of agitation and protest in his friends
1	true , we do not know what that sinner of a grigorievich is going to say
1	i get up and we will go on !
1	at the widow 's , is not there ?
1	the basses droned in the stove again , and it suddenly became frightening
1	who told you those are my words ?
1	the devil , that 's the last straw , he muttered , grinding his teeth , no , that would not suit me just now
1	ivan dmitrich knew very well that they had come to reset the stove in the kitchen , but fear whispered to him that they were policemen disguised as stovemakers
1	very well , so be it , velchaninov again paused briefly , i apologize to you ; but you must agree , pavel pavlovich , that after all this i no longer reckon myself as owing to you , that is , i am speaking with regard to the whole matter , and not only the present case
1	kutuzov , with the affectation of a frontline veteran , ordered his standing troops to attention and , saluting , rode up to the emperor
1	i live there in that house , we are coming to it
1	but he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range
1	ah , my god , but that i know !
1	i slapped myself on the head with my hand
1	and here i am thinking that i have not lagged behind your generation and understand contemporary youth
1	where is your tobacco ?
1	'you dare not sit together with noble children , you are of mean origin and the same as a lackey !
1	the mirror reflected an unattractive , weak body and a thin face
1	he had not meant to say that , he had meant to ask : how did you , the headman , get into this sack ?
1	she went up to him , and with a quick , supple , youthful movement dropped to her knees
1	that 's another slander , he yelled
1	who 's been pouring champagne into you just now ?
1	the sun , having just burst from behind the cloud that had covered it , sprayed its rays , half broken by the cloud , across the roofs of the street opposite , over the dew-covered dust of the road , over the walls of the houses , the windows , the fences , and pierre 's horses , which were standing by the cottage
1	the game was hide-and-seek
1	he was so sure that he was indeed the neapolitan king , that when , on the eve of his departure from naples , while strolling with his wife through the streets of the city , several italians had cried viva il re !
1	you did not imagine i would forgotten ?
1	the bright crescent shone in the sky
1	but now i recalled all the details of this meeting and in my mind said the most spiteful words and caustic replies to him
1	the french army melted away and was annihilated in the same proportion from moscow to vyazma , from vyazma to smolensk , from smolensk to the berezina , from the berezina to vilno , irrespective of the greater or lesser degree of the cold , the pursuit , the barring of roads , and all other conditions taken separately
1	do you want to ?
1	why has he taken such responsibility upon himself ?
1	no , it 's not enough , sir !
1	well , here 's the story
1	i don ’ t understand anything about it
1	why , i have three who will be highly honored to play the same game as myself
1	at first , at the very first , yes , i did have an urge , and i would fall into great restlessness
1	i do not care about him at all , i merely wanted to see the old lady , who was always kind to me and to whom i owe a great deal
1	at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall
1	but the artist should not forget that the notion of historical figures and events formed among people is based not on fantasy , but on historical documents , insofar as historians have been able to amass them ; and therefore , while understanding and presenting these figures and events differently , the artist ought to be guided , like the historian , by historical materials
1	: , so that even at that moment i should have been thrown into perplexity , seeing such an unexpected turnabout in her feelings , which meant , perhaps , in lambert 's as well
1	you , your highness , are pleased to reproach me , but what if i prove it ?
1	mikhail ivanovich , sit down
1	both were watching each other , but when their eyes met , quick as lightning they looked away
1	on the way home i talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him all sorts of things and amongst them that you were afraid that he might become insane
1	the bad presentiment that suddenly came over rostov was confirmed more and more the further he rode into the space beyond the village of pratz , occupied by crowds of different troops
1	the prince ordered that nobody should be found here
1	look into it more carefully and understand it !
1	availing myself of the first opportunity , i make some quip
1	it 's nothing , tanya , nothing
1	the visitor was reciting as if by rote , but all the while he spoke , he looked at the ground , though , of course , he could see everything above as well
1	you did not listen to me when i taught you reason , so you can weep now
1	who is he blinking at , god be with him ?
1	but here , in this portrait , the sun , as if on purpose , found sonya in her main moment—of modest , meek love and her somewhat wild , timorous chastity
1	hunching his shoulders and spreading his fingers wide , korostelev played a few chords and began singing show me such a haven where the russian muzhik does not groan in a tenor voice , and dymov sighed again , propped his head on his fist , and fell to thinking
1	god rest her soul ! —though the dear departed was always unfair to me
1	nous cherchons—il n ' y en a point
1	oh , yes , i understand , said the governor 's wife
1	z on turning over the soil for a new garden , a third more on budding with
1	finally the horsemen rode down off the barrow and disappeared from sight
1	more than two hours went by
1	maybe i should not have spoken in front of them , but i am no diplomat
1	sonya and the maids were holding her by the arms
1	now , why need you have come ?
1	what business is it of yours what i mean to do ?
1	he was young , tall , swarthy , with enormous hands , and by the looks of him you could see he had a bass voice , and in fact he boomed like a barrel : boo , boo , boo
1	he called me a liar , and i called him a liar
1	but , rodya , nothing would induce me to leave you now !
1	and both so handsome !
1	a decent hunk of lard , a few white loaves , and sometimes even a trussed-up chicken would go in as well
1	the next day , at the first sound of the trumpets , the friends parted : the musketeers rushed to the hôtel of m de tréville , the guards to that of m des essarts
1	maybe if i used my strength against women , i might chance to find them still weaker than i , and so might defeat them ; but i am fighting against men , and for them i am merely a woman
1	but i should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our most rising generation ' ?
1	give him alms , bazin , and tell him to pray for a poor sinner
1	no , they wo not accept it , they certainly wo not , because they found the jewel‐case and the man tried to hang himself , 'which he could not have done if he had not felt guilty
1	the weaver asked as they went
1	he laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered , pondered a long time
1	but what am i to do ?
1	and there i go lending the poor fellow twenty-five roubles today , ha , ha , ha !
1	at last , all confused , beautiful , trembling and weeping , she throws herself at my feet and says that i am her savior , and that she loves me more than anything in the world
1	i cry out to myself : courage and hope !
1	that 's nonsense , that 's arch-nonsense !
1	finally he raised his head , fixed his eagle eye on that loyal , open , intelligent physiognomy , read on that tear-furrowed face all the sufferings he had endured over the past month , and reflected for the third or fourth time on how much future this boy of twenty-one had before him , and what resources his activity , courage , and spirit could offer to a good master
1	i wanted him out of the way so that i could drink by myself !
1	the woman was english ?
1	but an especial and obvious hatred shone from the collaborator on the firebrand : he sprawled so in his chair , had such a proud and presumptuous air , snorted so independently !
1	it 's here somewhere , said lavrushka
1	look at the smoke !
1	authorial commentary , if not entirely absent , is kept to an absolute minimum
1	do not be angry , i did not mean you pavel pavlovich muttered , dropping his eyes
1	she probably opened the letter not knowing whom it was from
1	terror brought me back to myself
1	but … i didn ’ t allow it … murmured the unhappy prince
1	the commander of artillery of the rd corps , general fouché , will place the howitzers of the rd and th corps , sixteen in all , on the flanks of the battery designated to bombard the left fortification , which will bring against it a total of guns
1	he forced him to take the glass
1	they peeked out on the sly three times or so , and then drew all the blinds
1	then she broke her silence to cry out : you are cowards , you are wretched assassins , it takes ten of you to cut one woman 's throat !
1	with that , his face assumed an imposing mien
1	we know what a castle is : it ’ s a whole mountain of stones
1	he took solid , squirely care of his soul , and did good deeds not simply but imposingly
1	m le cardinal 's guards , perceiving his extreme youth and , what 's more , that he was a stranger to the corps , invited him to withdraw before they attacked
1	it will all go on trifles
1	pseldonymov would not hear of it
1	vi : his majesty king louis the thirteenth your majesty gives me his word that he will see no one between m de la trémouille and myself ?
1	what is it you ’ ve got there , ippolit ?
1	the doctor remained very displeased with something , changed something , turning the wounded man over so that he moaned again and , while he was being turned , again fainted from the pain and began to rave
1	and even if it were possible , what other feeling than vénération can a man like mon père evoke ?
1	the cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention ; when he came to the end , he read it a second time
1	yes , and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness
1	the captain of the king 's musketeers ?
1	they ran to the barn and came back , each by a separate porch
1	wait a bit , the new ones will speak
1	and , lowering his fat arm , he offered it to the slender girl
1	what are you waiting for ?
1	well , then , if you do not leave this very instant , i will have you arrested by order of the queen , and i will have them put you in that bastille you are so afraid of
1	it ’ s getting much too noisy and industrial in mankind , there is too little spiritual peace , complains a secluded thinker
1	i left with the intention of remaining in europe , my dear , and never coming home
1	at last i have sort of got you by the collar !
1	xiv : sashenka and nadenka
1	the prince found his fiancée locked in the bedroom , in tears , in despair , in hysterics ; for a long time she refused to listen to anything they said to her through the locked door ; at last she opened it , let in only the prince , locked the door after him , and fell on her knees before him
1	how many days would it take to make two pendants like these ?
1	and like vygoda , with its strongly accented first syllable , profit leaps from the mouth almost with the force of an expletive , quite unlike the more unctuous advantage or its russian equivalent preimushchestvo
1	cried andrei yefimych , trembling all over
1	that is , you think you can live more intelligently than everyone else ?
1	the news that liza had not told me anything simply crushed him
1	how can i renounce evil imaginings forever , so as peacefully to do thy will ?
1	and there flashed in pierre 's imagination the dinner at the club , when he had challenged dolokhov , and his benefactor in torzhok
1	i am at least twice as strong as you are and i have nothing to fear , besides
1	and it was quite an accident lebeziatnikov 's turning up
1	one of the two horsemen , the one who had spoken second , was ten paces in front of his companion
1	he was lying on his back , still dazed from his recent oblivion
1	the count stood by the window and , without turning his face , listened to natasha 's words
1	he looked at sonia and felt how great was her love for him , and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved
1	he rushed like a madman to pick it up , seized the packet , clutched it convulsively in his hand , which sank from the heavy weight
1	well , andrei petrovich , dear heart , what have they done with our young lady ?
1	you don ’ t answer me ?
1	princess marya understood everything
1	now , when his uneasiness had become quite noticeable , aglaya ’ s agitation and uneasiness also grew , and each time he looked behind him , she almost at once looked around as well
1	he was warming up by the fire
1	oh , he came to me so frightened !
1	a day and a night are soon past
1	you know my rules : everything 's in the open !
1	what am i to do ?
1	but there was such ardor in his eyes , such persuasiveness in his voice , that she felt drawn to trust him
1	maybe you were not expecting me , eh ?
1	and how did you become acquainted with my daughter ?
1	when everything was ready , the traveler opened his eyes , moved to the table , and , having poured himself a glass , poured another for the beardless old man and handed it to him
1	this made so quick and complete a diversion to the attack that d'artagnan 's adversary , while the former turned to face this hail of blows , sheathed his sword with the same precision , and , from the actor he had failed to be , became a spectator of the combat , a role he fulfilled with his ordinary impassivity , though muttering to himself : a plague on these gascons !
1	he got up and took his cap
1	this is what i wanted to say
1	the light rain stopped ; only mist fell and drops of water from the branches of the trees
1	observed zametov , yes , that 's quite possible
1	regarding my gratitude for your visits , rest assured that everything my means will permit
1	prince andrei sighed with relief , smiled , and held out his hand
1	look , your excellency , today they buried the actual privy councillor tarasevich
1	but what about the painter ?
1	and it would have meant a terrible scandal for dounia too ; that would have been inevitable
1	half a minute goes by and there is more knocking
1	the gentleman asked sternly , scowling in haughty astonishment
1	what are you to be pitied for ?
1	shy and chaste , i swear !
1	yes , yes , all right , the count said quickly , only , excuse me , my friend , i will give you twenty thousand , and a promissory note for eighty thousand besides
1	voyons à qui en avez vous avec votre roi de prusse ?
1	but what an end !
1	that 's sure , pavel ivanych , a bad man 's cherished nowhere , not at home , not in the service , but if you live right , obey orders , then who has any need to offend you ?
1	well , yes , naturally i do not mean that—that is , not in that sense—i only wanted to say that despite any
1	berg was sitting by the countess and , with respectful intimacy , was trying to comfort her
1	i have a headache and no money
1	they started coming to see me often , asking me to tell them stories ; it seems i did it well , because they liked listening to me very much
1	but the secluded position of svidrigaïlov 's lodging had suddenly struck her
1	that 's why love among relations is immoral , mama , because it 's unearned
1	aha , so they have stuck you in here , too , my dear !
1	as far as i am concerned , you may all go to hell , but from what i see , it 's clear to me that i ca not make head or tail of it ; please do not think i have come to ask you questions
1	baron , but maybe he was just an official—who knows !
1	he moved away from the window , shut it , lighted the candle , put on his waistcoat , his overcoat and his hat and went out , carrying the candle , into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle‐ends and all sorts of rubbish , to pay him for the room and leave the hotel
1	i thought ceaselesslywell , no matter , let her come
1	i drew my sword in turn , and as he came back to the charge , i believe i felt that , in throwing himself upon me , he ran himself through
1	i look upon you with tenderness ; oh , god bless you !
1	i thank your serenity , replied prince andrei , but i am afraid i am no longer fit for the staff , he said with a smile , which kutuzov noticed
1	perhaps you are right after all : men know far more about politics than women , and you above all , m bonacieux , who have talked with the cardinal
1	i went straight into the military …
1	while he bent over the kettle , scooping up big spoonfuls and greedily chewing one after another , his face could be seen in the firelight , and the soldiers silently looked at him
1	i will re-pin it , and she rushed forward , and the sewing girls , who had no time to follow her , tore off a piece of gauze
1	it looks as if you begrudge telling us , aglaya needled him
1	winter has exchanged his usual stupidity for a previously unknown prudence
1	which was why this unconscious tune of the uncle 's , as in the songs of birds , was so extraordinarily good
1	you are the very portrait of him , and not so much in face as in soul
1	imagine that all of us , rich and poor , work only three hours a day , and the rest of our time is left free
1	he pulled a used deck , wrapped in paper , out of his pocket and handed it to the prince
1	so will you come ?
1	and this is too light , it wo not do , no , it wo not do !
1	just like a prison
1	katerina ivanovna rose from her chair , and with a stern and apparently calm voice ( though she was pale and her chest was heaving ) observed that if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa , she , katerina ivanovna , would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot
1	one fine morning liza enters my room and says in a joking tone :
1	he took a few gold coins from the pocket of his wide trousers and put them on the platter for her
1	my wife suddenly remembers that i have not had my tea yet and becomes alarmed
1	ah , what a pity i did not see you greet the children , said natasha
1	yes , word of honor
1	lord de winter passed before the door without stopping , and the sound of his footsteps could be heard going away
1	she was the first to hold her up to disgrace : when they heard in the village that marie had come back , everybody ran to look at her , and nearly the whole village came running to the old woman ’ s cottage : old men , children , women , girls , everybody , in such a hustling , greedy crowd
1	from that point on , rogozhin becomes the prince ’ s shadow , lurking , menacing , hiding , yet inseparable from him , until the final scene finds them pressed face to face
1	besides , what value has the life of that sickly , stupid , ill‐natured old woman in the balance of existence !
1	i see you fight seriously , and painfully , too !
1	they all exchanged questioning glances ; but the prince , it seemed , did not understand these words and was in the highest degree of happiness
1	raskolnikov gave her what came first—fifteen copecks
1	porthos , without replying , took a second step away
1	razumihin said to zossimov
1	pierre stopped , pressing himself to the edge of the road , which was dug out of the hillside
1	yes , i will go up and then suddenly will it be a pistol or a dagger ?
1	first , i put it to you that we have no right to ask that of the sovereign , and second , if the russian nobility did have that right , the sovereign could not answer us
1	kolya stopped to see him , also for a moment ; this one was indeed in a hurry and in great and dark anxiety
1	v : the king 's musketeers and the cardinal 's guards d'artagnan knew no one in paris
1	pardieu , as if i did not !
1	on the contrary , in that first confused moment in bed , right after nastasya egorovna 's departure , i did not even linger over lambert , but
1	why is it hard to imagine eternity ?
1	ganya suddenly turned , hearing her get up from her seat
1	she aimed straight at my head
1	but why , my good sir , all of a minute what is it ?
1	aglaya said impatiently and wrathfully , getting up from her chair
1	one believes and disbelieves—everything
1	it ended with an embittered break between them , and it seems he wanted to kill her ; he frightened her and maybe would have killed her ; but it all suddenly turned to hatred
1	jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave
1	he said suddenly in a completely different voice , looking at me in bewilderment
1	‡ my husband is mistaken
1	never mind , never mind
1	prepares for institutions of learning—of course , that also means in arithmetic ?
1	i was in the sixth class at the gymnasium , said zametov with some dignity
1	i will show you their pamphlets
1	take your old woman and god speed you
1	what , does he really love you , this lover ?
1	but the maid didn ’ t open the door , not wishing to waken mr vilkin , and maybe not wanting to get out of bed herself
1	you do not say there 's no one at home , the new‐comer cried in a cheerful , ringing voice , addressing the first visitor , who still went on pulling the bell
1	aramis , after a trip to lorraine , disappeared all at once and stopped writing to his friends
1	someone may be watching you besides me , and it wo not do you any good
1	when the preparations for the night were over , natasha slowly lowered herself onto the sheet that covered the straw , on the side nearest the door
1	well , what makes you go to war ?
1	she does understand it ; don ’ t be angry with her
1	i straightaway bribed the maiden aunt , the younger one , with a hundred roubles , and gave her twenty-five up front
1	she glanced at the clock , got up , sat down again , smiled at d'artagnan with a look that meant to say : you are very nice , of course , but you would be so charming if you left !
1	lipa could not get used to it either , and after her husband left , she slept not in her own bed but wherever she happened to be—in the kitchen or the shed—and every day she washed the floors or did the laundry , and it seemed to her that she was doing day labor
1	pulcheria alexandrovna caught her up , hotly and jealously
1	get undressed and have a good sleep
1	they are buffoons , panie , buffoons !
1	and they are pleased , pleased !
1	razumihin stood a moment , thought and let his hand drop
1	no , simply : maison de ma mere , [ ] he decided to himself
1	his swollen , lazy eyes are turned to the iconostasis
1	and i shall venture to explain it precisely to you , lev nikolaevich , as a man the sincerity of whose reception and the nobility of whose feelings i trust as … as … you ’ re not surprised at my words , prince ?
1	cried a multitude of voices
1	the blood rushed to natasha 's face and her feet made an involuntary movement , but she could not jump up and run
1	what reason was there to suppose there was a tendency to revolt in the city ?
1	you can see i have no strength left ; you can see i ca not walk : flee by yourself !
1	i read it , my dear , and of course there was a great deal i did not understand ; but that 's only natural—how should i ?
1	do not laugh , and do not be angry !
1	but when varya left lizaveta prokofyevna and said good-bye to the girls , they did not even know that she had been denied the house once and for all and that she was saying good-bye to them for the last time
1	and it would have been too disadvantageous for him if she , bypassing him , wheedled the document out of me , and we entered into an part three agreement
1	the staircase seemed strangely familiar
1	dolokhov walked slowly , without raising his pistol , his light , shining blue eyes peering into his adversary 's face
1	and he will say , 'come to me !
1	there ’ s no need for all this … the prince tried to begin
1	the essential relations of strength had changed , and it became necessary to attack
1	i think that 's all nonsense and there 's no need of softness ; on the contrary , what 's wanted is protest
1	dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother
1	if they receive me—good ; if not—that also may be very good
1	among the men in the back , wearing the same shakos , stood a russian hussar
1	he listened to the reports brought to him , gave orders when his subordinates demanded it ; but , as he listened to the reports , it seemed that he was not interested in the meaning of the words being said to him , but that something else in the expression of the face , in the tone of the reporter 's speech interested him
1	lebedev sat the prince down on a green wooden bench , at a green table fixed in the ground , and placed himself opposite him
1	here you will meet such waists as you have never seen in dreams : slender , narrow waists , no whit thicker than a bottle 's neck , on meeting which you deferentially step aside , lest you somehow imprudently nudge them with your discourteous elbow ; timidity and fear will come over your heart , lest somehow from your imprudent breath the loveliest work of nature and art should be broken
1	they found it impossible to educate me systematically because of my illness
1	well , in prison , it seems , he remembered the venerable elder ; the bible , too , made its appearance again
1	be that as it may , interest in the event grew daily , the more so as there remained not the slightest doubt that the scandalous wedding would actually take place
1	i am going to see mama
1	the old woman came back
1	they have begun to forget about anisim
1	it 's a government clerk retired from the service , marmeladov
1	to be sure , said d'artagnan
1	when the prince asked precisely when rogozhin had called , the captain ’ s widow named almost the same hour when nastasya filippovna had supposedly seen him that day in her garden
1	and if there is not that , there 's nothing
1	aux suivants l'intérêt et le ridicule montent comme de raison
1	a woman , if she 's in love , likes to be kept in a tight fist
1	to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two concepts , the philosophy of history can and must follow a path opposite to the one other sciences have taken
1	in short , he was a real landowner a landowner good and proper
1	will you come for dinner ?
1	all right , you will get there !
1	i am wicked , i see that , he thought to himself , feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to dounia
1	english joneses and french coques walk hand in hand with the charges entrusted to their parental care and , with proper gravity , explain to them that the signs over the shops are made so that by means of them one may learn what is to be found inside the shop
1	in speaking of it to dounia , he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired , and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too
1	catching the expression of his face and gaze , she suddenly grew timid and felt guilty
1	as if i had gone so as to encounter it
1	and it was falling yesterday , and it was falling the other day as well
1	having finished his shop talk , my colleague abruptly stands up and , waving his hat in the direction of my work , starts taking his leave
1	ashamed as i am , i will describe one that occurred the other day after dinner
1	she is in prison ?
1	but anyhow , i repeat , it ’ s as you wish
1	since then , sir , he went on after a brief pause—since then , owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil‐intentioned persons—in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect—since then my daughter sofya semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket , and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us
1	in inexpressible anguish , he reached his inn on foot
1	now , now , now , aglaya
1	i suddenly felt so drunk , sir
1	he suddenly said unnaturally and threw down his chisel
1	tikhon knew the prince 's habit of sometimes expressing his thoughts aloud , and therefore with an unchanged face met the irately questioning gaze of the face that emerged from the shirt
1	in any case , i ca not take him there the way he is !
1	i was here when you were lying ill in bed , not officially , not in my own person , but i was here
1	i will promise them monthly rations and quarters on the estate near moscow ; i am sure andré would do still more in my place , she thought , approaching in the twilight the crowd standing on the green by the barn
1	if you do ( which is obvious ) , then do you intend , or do you find it right in all conscience , having obtained millions in your turn , to reward pavlishchev ’ s needy son , even though he bears the name of burdovsky ?
1	the only difference is that i do not contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals , as you call it
1	she will have returned to the louvre
1	the fact is that it wasn ’ t , it turned out badly , people actually told all sorts of things , many told the truth , and , imagine , many even enjoyed the telling , but then they all felt ashamed , they couldn ’ t stand it !
1	i was my own judge , and— god , what there was in my soul !
1	after these irritations , bile would spread over her face , and her maids knew by sure signs when mrs belov would again be deaf , and the snuff would again be damp , and when her face would turn yellow
1	are you late somewhere ?
1	and though i was standing some way off , i saw it all
1	then rostov was laid in a sleigh and accompanied to the first posting station
1	but here again the whole incident is shrouded in mist , and what came later is decidedly unknown
1	scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his brain , but he could not catch at one , he could not rest on one , in spite of all his efforts
1	marmeladov—such is my name ; titular counsellor
1	this … this i do not understand !
1	as in the austerlitz disposition , it was written , though not in german :
1	there was vodka , rum and lisbon wine , all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity
1	she was a diminutive , withered up old woman of sixty , with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose
1	yes , a capital thing , answered raskolnikov , looking at him almost ironically
1	read them , andryusha , and persuade papa to write more often
1	why , he there was asking whether a student lived here , mentioned your name and whom you lodged with
1	in the course of a boring day , during which prince andrei was entertained by the older hosts and the most respected guests , who filled the old count 's house on the occasion of an approaching name-day party , bolkonsky glanced several times at natasha , who was laughing at something and having fun among the other , young half of the company , still asking himself : what is she thinking about ?
1	i became all light as a bird
1	it was not what he read in the letter that made him angry ; what made him angry was that the life there , now foreign to him , could excite him
1	it 's a delight for some girls to live at home !
1	when velchaninov bent down carefully to her little head , to kiss at least the edge of her dress in farewell—she suddenly opened her eyes as if she had been waiting for him , and whispered :
1	this joyful news contributed greatly to my recovery when i regained consciousness
1	please come to the portrait room
1	two years later he used this letter to request the money from me through the court , and with interest , so that he surprised me again , the more so as he literally went about collecting money for building a church of god , and since then he 's been wandering for twenty years
1	all rushed out of the village again , but tushin 's guns could not move , and the artillerists , tushin , and the junker silently looked at each other , awaiting their fate
1	there was a moment 's silence
1	this article she was continually reading , she even read it aloud , almost took it to bed with her , but scarcely asked where rodya was , though the subject was obviously avoided by the others , which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions
1	quite so , svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour
1	it is the same every morning
1	you can see very well that i have no sword , said the englishman
1	he sat down in the place shown him by the beautiful hélène and listened to the general conversation
1	they would have too easy a time with four isolated men , while four men together make a troop
1	you are told that the wind can snap its chain , that you are brutes , pechenegs , and you believe it ; you get it in the neck , and kiss the man 's hand ; some animal in a raccoon coat robs you , then tosses you a fifteen-kopeck tip , and you say :
1	you know how preposterously shy and modest she ’ s been all along : as a child she used to get into the wardrobe and sit there for two or three hours , only so as not to come out to the guests ; she ’ s grown into such a big thing , but it ’ s the same now
1	and if your majesty 's suspicions , the three musketeers which i continue to doubt , turned out to have some substance , what a terrible scandal !
1	i have been waiting for you like a sun that would light up everything for me
1	the higher human reason rises in the discovery of these purposes , the more obvious for it is the inaccessibility of the final purpose
1	time means nothing here … even for a physical requital … but i got a moral … a moral slap , not a physical one !
1	je vous offre mon amitié
1	yes , the solitary awareness of strength is fascinating and beautiful
1	but the landlady is out of the question ; it 's all right for me , but it 's out of the question for you : she would not take you , for she 's for she 's a fool she would be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you , too , if you want to know of avdotya romanovna certainly
1	yes , i bowed down to him and prayed for him
1	i consider this coincidence of words fateful , almost miraculous
1	on the narrow dam of augesd , on which for so many years an old miller in a cap used to sit peacefully with his fishing rods , while his grandson , his shirtsleeves rolled up , fingered the silvery , trembling fish in the watering can ; on this dam over which , for so many years , moravians in shaggy hats and blue jackets had peacefully driven in their two-horse carts laden with wheat and had driven back over the same dam all dusty with flour , their carts white— now , on this narrow dam , between wagons and cannon , under horses and between wheels , crowded men disfigured by the fear of death , crushing each other , dying , stepping over the dying , and killing each other , only to go a few steps and be killed themselves just the same
1	that time i borrowed from the prince
1	he dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to europe from the depths of asia
1	the dying man probably understood little ; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds
1	lambert might not lambert have gotten in with her as well ?
1	what would it matter to you , he cried a moment later with a sort of despair , what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong ?
1	the other three patients—two soldiers and a sailor—who played cards all day long , are now asleep and muttering to themselves
1	we will part , if you please , but only if you give me a fortune , said hélène to part—how scary !
1	preparing to do something , this gentleman will at once expound to you , with great eloquence and clarity , precisely how he must needs act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth
1	ivan dmitrich proved unable to endure such a life , he lost heart , wasted away , and , quitting the university , went home
1	the whole crowd of his listeners instantly made the same movement , seeking the extraordinary portrait with their eyes
1	he , he alone , was the cause of it all—and yet he was the only one i was not angry with then
1	snorting and grunting , he turned now his fat back , now his hairy , fat chest under the brush with which a valet was rubbing his body
1	despite the non-russian locality and surroundings— orchards , stone walls , tile roofs , mountains visible in the distance—and the non-russian folk gazing with curiosity at the soldiers , the regiment looked exactly the same as any russian regiment waiting for review somewhere in central russia
1	liza , the children , work—oh , how we both dreamed of it all , dreamed of it here , right in these rooms , and what then ?
1	a life for one night with me ! … ’
1	bolkhovitinov was all covered with mud , and , wiping it with his sleeve , he smeared it over his face
1	she took the book however
1	said pulcheria alexandrovna , addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay
1	the three musketeers this hesitation aroused some suspicions in the three friends , and athos , advancing a few paces , called out in a firm voice : who goes there ?
1	after which he at once began a merry little conversation , into which he successfully inserted two or three compliments
1	now , you ’ re not offended when i tell you to your face that you ’ re ridiculous ?
1	and so , while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable , he was not at all resigned to dying meekly , as another man less courageous and less reasonable than he would have been in his place
1	petya was standing by the door when denisov said that
1	and do you suppose , from the character of our legal system , that they will accept , or that they are in a position to accept , this fact—resting simply on a psychological impossibility—as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution ?
1	he turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room
1	i cried to him
1	there was no knowledge , but my heart throbbed with anticipations , and evil spirits already possessed my dreams
1	the wine was also transferred there
1	you can see it 's all burned down , and that 's the end of it why are you pushing , as if there 's not road enough , he turned gruffly to a man walking behind him , who had not pushed him at all
1	zershchikov pointed to the spot where it was lying , was lying just now , and that spot turned out to be right next to me , adjoining me , the place where my money lay , meaning much closer to me than to aferdov
1	she cried , my god !
1	look , what a day , look , how good !
1	you always maintained that i was a fool , but by jove , my boy , there are greater fools than i am !
1	and , on top of that , you sit there and get surprised at me
1	but you do not believe it anyway , raskolnikov let slip in his anger
1	the official whispered to raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor , but he ordered him to be sent for
1	in the first place , she appeared to be a girl quite young , and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves , waving her arms about in an absurd way
1	xxvii : the wife of athos tell me , athos , tell me
1	she only saw that pyotr petrovitch had somehow come to grief
1	and the further back we transport ourselves in examining events , the less arbitrary they appear to us
1	some foolishness , some trifling carelessness , and i may betray myself !
1	the poor knight ’ is that same don quixote , only a serious and not a comic one
1	i cough , i begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing
1	then it 's clear they do not teach you much sense there in your seminary
1	he has been raised by foster parents and tutors , has seen his mother , a peasant woman from versilov 's estate , two or three times in his life and his father only once
1	police stood by the brightly lit porch laid with red baize , and not merely gendarmes , but a mounted police chief and dozens of police officers
1	said the woman with the violet nose , pointing at the weaver 's wife
1	no , said porthos , there go two or three of them limping for safety
1	dostoevsky 's reply to chernyshevsky is both ideological and artistic , the implication being that the two are inseparable , and the further implication being that the indispensable unity of artistic form reflects a more primordial unity of the living person
1	for some reason i absolutely wanted him to begin first
1	i easily climbed the fence and went down this avenue , slipping on the fir needles that lay inches-thick on the ground
1	yesterday , playing chess with the king , m le cardinal told us , with an air of condolence which greatly displeased me , that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers , those daredevils—he stressed these words with an ironic accent that displeased me still more— those true destroyers , he added , looking at me with his tiger-cat 's eyes , had stayed late at a tavern on the rue férou , and that a patrol of his guards had been forced to arrest the troublemakers
1	the philosopher tried shouting , but his voice was completely muffled on all sides and met no response
1	my god is myself , myself and whoever helps me in my revenge !
1	when we cleaned the cottage for the colonel , we carried some of them out
1	indeed , in all of european literature there is no writer for whom dreams play such a large and crucial role as dostoevsky
1	your coffee will get cold , she said suddenly
1	he could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything ; his ideas seemed to gallop after one another , he talked incoherently , his hands trembled slightly
1	what did you write about ?
1	having reached the troops of the left flank , he did not ride forward , where the shooting was , but went looking for the general and the officers where they could not be , and therefore did not deliver the order
1	what are you saying , pyotr fyodorovich ?
1	finally , the walls of his own room began to show clearly before him
1	it will remain your responsibility if the enemy is in a position to detach a considerable corps for petersburg and threaten this capital , in which not many troops could remain , for with the army entrusted to you , acting resolutely and actively , you have all the means to prevent this new misfortune
1	all the tenants of the apartments came crowding around
1	he shuddered all over when just ahead of him the carpathian mountains appeared , and tall krivan , its crown covered with a gray cloud as with a cap ; and his horse raced on and was already roaming in the mountains
1	but that is all folly !
1	smoking was not prohibited , but neither was it permitted ; sort of half permitted , as usual ; well , and depending on the person
1	i will not speak of these dishes , because i much prefer eating them to holding forth on them in conversation
1	but , nevertheless , i know this as a most trustworthy fact : just a few days before his death , the old man , having summoned his daughter and his friends , pelishchev and prince v—sky , told katerina nikolaevna , in the likely chance of his imminent demise , to be sure to allot sixty thousand roubles of this capital to anna andreevna
1	not a bit of it , said razumihin , stung to the quick
1	the man is coming here , you say ?
1	at the council in fili , the predominant thought of the russian command was that a retreat straight back , that is , down the nizhni novgorod road , went without saying
1	what right have you to speak to her like that ?
1	( he was obviously angry )
1	it is , however , the only one we can give you
1	i will tell you both this , i pronounced , if it 's vile in the world , the only vile thing is me , and all the rest is lovely !
1	it was already light in the solitary street
1	the two interlocutors thus set out at a gallop , moving off along opposite sides of the road
1	and meanwhile ivan ilyich was falling more and more into reverie and into a certain round of ideas ; distracted , he imperceptibly but ceaselessly sipped from his glass
1	he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something
1	that position he occupied until he was dismissed on account of illness
1	nor am i capable of self-humiliation out of purity of heart
1	indeed , as this last reflection , this instinctive return to hope , indicated , fear and weak sentiments did not float for long on the surface of this deep soul
1	dron was of the same opinion ; but as soon as he expressed it , karp and some other muzhiks fell upon the former headman
1	maybe it is colorful ; one need only sort through the full-dress military and civil uniforms of all times and all peoples – that alone is worth something , and if you were to add the uniforms of the lower civil ranks , you could really break a leg ; no historian would be left standing
1	she would make a nice princess !
1	mon cher , you give the necessary orders i do not know about such things , she said , lowering her eyes guiltily
1	maybe there ’ s a man who has had the sentence read to him , has been allowed to suffer , and has then been told , go , you ’ re forgiven
1	it wo not be much trouble , i assure you
1	now for the boots
1	in any case , she did not consider herself guilty of anything , and gavrila ardalionovich had better learn on what terms she had been living all those years in petersburg , in what relations with afanasy ivanovich , and how much money she had saved
1	but he will start it himself , your excellency
1	some five years ago i passed through the town of mirgorod
1	we must live by the law of nature and truth , mrs dergachev said from behind the door
1	for pity 's sake , they will shout at you , you ca not rebel : it 's two times two is four !
1	perhaps they indeed expected something extraordinary
1	too bad you seem to know how to make a proper entrance ; where did you learn that ?
1	the croups of the horses in the front row moved
1	dolokhov remained by the gate
1	even if it was a great deal of trouble for me prince andrei said , as if guessing what it was about
1	i am from the province of smolensk
1	her character was like mine , that is , domineering and proud , and i always thought , both then and now , that she came to love the prince precisely because , having no character , he submitted fully to her domination , from the first word and hour
1	the cardinal dismounted ; the three musketeers did the same
1	but this counting skins , who brought in how many—it 's all the same to me !
1	sometimes , when the cardinal , always riding about like the least soldier of the army , ran his thoughtful gaze over these works being built under his command , though much more slowly than he would have liked , by engineers he had brought from all corners of the realm of france , if he met with a musketeer of tréville 's company , he would approach him , look at him in a singular fashion , and , recognizing that he was not one of our four companions , turn his profound gaze and his vast thought elsewhere
1	she came in again at two o'clock with soup
1	she said , could he know ?
1	the old prince did not want to hope : he decided that prince andrei had been killed , and though he sent an official to austria to look for his son 's traces , he ordered a gravestone for him in moscow , which he intended to put in his garden , and told everyone that his son had been killed
1	oh , that 's not it , that 's not it , sonia cried in distress
1	i believe it , my fghriend , i believe it , and i share it and appghrove
1	for me to keep quiet ?
1	next day sonia did not come , nor the day after ; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily
1	these thoughts , all gilded as they were by a last glimmer of love , were no less sad for that
1	he sat for a couple of minutes , smiled guiltily , and left
1	he was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated
1	they were tough and sour , but as pushkin said , wouldearer to us than a host of truths is an exalting illusion
1	the author himself took the verses from him and began to read
1	d'artagnan glanced around him
1	and so , the first moments of captivity were terrible : several convulsions of rage , which she had been unable to master , had paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature
1	when he looked more attentively , he could no longer see them
1	surely , good man , you must be known for your holy life and god-pleasing deeds , and maybe she heard about you
1	kovrin joked and laughed
1	even the table‐cloth was nearly clean ; the crockery , knives , forks and glasses were , of course , of all shapes and patterns , lent by different lodgers , but the table was properly laid at the time fixed , and amalia ivanovna , feeling she had done her work well , had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride
1	is it from london that you brought back that handsome diamond sparkling on your finger ?
1	maybe it 's your destiny that you and she live as a couple
1	rostov remembered what reply he should have given only when the man was already gone
1	liza came out with a pale little face , her eyes downcast , and took her bag
1	you have been misunderstanding me , i think , rodion romanovitch , he added after a brief pause , that 's why you are so surprised
1	he took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him , without turning or looking at dounia
1	do not think ill of me
1	i really don ’ t know if there was anything between them , that is , i mean to say , whether he could have had any serious hopes
1	unquestionably , for him the height of bliss was the fact alone that he could again visit aglaya without hindrance , that he would be allowed to talk with her , sit with her , walk with her , and , who knows , perhaps that alone would have contented him for the rest of his life !
1	the uncle wrapped natasha up and said goodbye to her with a completely new tenderness
1	shouted nastasya , banging with her fist on the door
1	and died three days before the dormition
1	he stood over her
1	said chartkov , and did not finish
1	all memories of this passion turned to disgrace for him ; he blushed to the point of tears and suffered remorse
1	but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late
1	what a stupid thing i have done , he thought to himself , they have sonia and i want it myself
1	they are hastening to town to find work
1	the birds of the air neither sow nor reap , but your father feeds them , [ ] he said to himself and wanted to say it to the princess
1	he slapped me on the shoulder
1	well , now , she smiled venomously , as if pondering , resurrected !
1	and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard ; he was holding his father 's hand and looking with dread at the tavern
1	when the prince returned home , at around nine o ’ clock , he found vera lukyanovna and the maid on the terrace
1	they are generally very timid : a star or a thick epaulette throws them into such confusion that nevsky prospect they unwittingly lower the price of their works
1	the aunt said and looked intently at ivan fyodorovich , who blushed and dropped his eyes
1	but katerina nikolaevna continued to rebel with implacable hatred
1	i kept nagging at myself , in furious hysterics , sometimes waking up , say , between two and three in the morningwhy precisely you and not him ?
1	briskly shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches , spreading the smell of scent around him , and admiring his lady , and himself , and the fine shape of his legs in their tight buckskins , nikolai was saying to the blonde that there was a certain lady there in voronezh that he wanted to abduct
1	natasha , having risen and curtsied , also did not know what to do with herself
1	you will come , you will come to‐morrow ?
1	toll wrote a disposition ; die erste kolonne marschier , and so on
1	i agreed , natasha now said to herself , that it would be terrible if he was left suffering always
1	you want to buy it
1	and he collapsed on the ground
1	forgive me , grandpa , he says , 'for christ 's sake
1	razumihin had nothing to say , so pulcheria alexandrovna was anxious again
1	natasha began to calm down , but it was clear from her face that she realized all the importance of her friend 's grief
1	i did not believe that such things happened to others , and therefore kept it to myself all my life as a secret
1	having recovered and realizing perfectly well whom he was dealing with , the officer politely ( though covering his face with a handkerchief ) addressed the prince , who had gotten up from the chair :
1	and much good it does me , chevalier , said milady , for do you know what 's happening ?
1	read the holy scriptures , but without the proper feeling
1	where are the proofs that it 's so ?
1	the philosopher wanted to push her away with his hands , but noticed to his astonishment that his arms would not rise , nor would his legs move ; with horror he discovered that the sound of his voice would not even come from his mouth : the words stirred soundlessly on his lips
1	i tell you so that you can take measures now
1	look into it more carefully and understand it !
1	' i will creep down the stairs , i thought , 'and go out , and then go on
1	( ) however close together we bring the time of judgment to the time of the act , we will never get a concept of freedom in time
1	i thought you would cry out again wouldo not speak of it , leave off
1	he may even amuse us a bit , at least so far as i can judge about him
1	are you going already ?
1	métivier , arriving on that morning with his felicitations , found it appropriate in his quality as a doctor de forcer la consigne , [ ] as he said to princess marya , and went to see the prince
1	she said , as if oblivious of the cold , insulting gaze directed at her
1	i will leave now , i wo not say another word to him , thought pierre
1	besides , you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother
1	this ought to be in-ves-tigated !
1	now , then , who are you ?
1	he suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay
1	he had his own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening here
1	i did not know that you pledged things at the old woman 's , too
1	even zametov is rude is zametov rude ?
1	and if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties
1	he gathered up all his packets , put them back into the sack , and , without looking at him , went out from behind the screen
1	but once again all this pleasant mood did not exist for long
1	historians of culture are perfectly consistent in relation to their progenitors , the general historians , for if historical events can be explained by the fact that certain people had such-and-such relations with each other , then why not explain them by the fact that such-and-such people wrote such-and-such books ?
1	strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and restore general safety
1	elle est bien malheureuse , [ ] anna pavlovna added
1	mon cher , vous m'avez promis , [ ] she addressed her son again , touching his hand to encourage him
1	we stopped at cyrus of persia
1	ah , your excellency , zherkov mixed in , not taking his eyes from the hussars , but still with his naïve manner , which made it impossible to tell whether he was speaking seriously or not
1	wouldo you know , she says , 'that he wanted to insult me ?
1	the general curiosity received a new and extraordinary jolt
1	as for me , athos responded to this whole story , i am quite at ease ; it wo not be women who pay the cost of my harness
1	and he really does it out of the kindness of his heart , i know him
1	where do you place stenay , athos ?
1	but you are wrong , you wo not do it !
1	i still wanted to move about , and so i would suddenly sink into some murky , subterranean , vile debauch – not a great , but a measly little debauch
1	and since up to the eleventh of july the manifesto and appeal had not been received , exaggerated rumors about them and about the situation of russia went around
1	the day after this conversation , natasha put on that old dress which was especially known for making her cheerful in the mornings , and with that morning began her former way of life , which she had abandoned since the ball
1	i do not know anything , said pierre
1	on the sofa another child slept , a three-year-old girl , covered , it seemed , with a tailcoat
1	what she did with that deed , god alone knows
1	but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all
1	oh , yes raskolnikov sipped the glass , put a morsel of bread in his mouth and , suddenly looking at zametov , seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together
1	ukrainian tales here a new marvel appeared : the clouds flew off of the highest mountain , and on its peak appeared a mounted man , in full knightly armor , with his eyes shut , and he could be seen as if he were standing up close to them
1	here you are in our domain
1	i ’ m of exactly the same opinion , adelaida proclaimed solemnly
1	you are making it all up !
1	then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind , and for a moment he waked up to reality
1	the thing is that the men you rode around the position with not only do not contribute to the general course of things , but hinder it
1	i was the only one who went up , everybody was silent ; there were no competitors
1	so that 's all there is to so-called heroism ?
1	besides , makar ivanovich had ordered her to marry
1	i suffered all evening , all night , i am partly suffering now as well
1	he looked back on the experience as rather gloomy , and later lost his faith , but his familiarity with church life shows in many of his stories , and his knowledge of the services and prayers was probably more precise than that of any other russian writer
1	i assure you i am proud of these breeches , and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light , summer trousers of grey woollen material
1	to begin with there were rumours
1	one of those present , older than the others , with a frightened and angry face , suddenly moved forward and was about to seize dolokhov by the shirt
1	if god should see fit to test you in the duties of marriage , be ready to fulfill his will
1	so you would be russians ?
1	for one little moment , sir !
1	with that he warmly voiced his opinion that the prince , quite strangely and for god knows what reason , was called an idiot , that he thought completely the opposite of him , and that he was most certainly a man who kept his own counsel
1	when we got up from the table , i went over to mama , embraced her warmly , and wished her a happy birthday
1	he was made rather recently , as well , and is still quite proud of his advancement
1	wouldo not let anybody read over me , daddy , but send to the kiev seminary at once and bring the student khoma brut
1	bon , je vous laisse dans votre petit coin
1	this time i found my knife under the pillow , and while i feigned sleep , my hand convulsively gripped its handle
1	on the table next to her lay the opened letter from anatole
1	if we examine a man alone , without his relation to everything around him , his every action appears free to us
1	there was no answer ; i thought i could hear her footsteps down below
1	that 's all i keep repeating
1	my ruin has made me much richer
1	and that kept her from guessing his words
1	princess marya disliked natasha at first sight
1	she is bound to want to 'save him , to bring him to his senses , and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims , and restore him to new life and usefulness—well , we all know how far such dreams can go
1	after the loss of sevastopol , the artillery commander kryzhanovsky sent me the reports of the artillery officers from all the bastions and asked me to put those more than twenty accounts together into one
1	i heard yesterday … ( though i have no right ) , but if you ever need a faithful servant in anything , he ’ s here before you
1	i must say , i was never very glad of this marriage
1	at that moment , amalia ivanovna , deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation , and not being listened to , made one last effort , and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation , that in the future boarding‐school she would have to pay particular attention to die wäsche , and that there certainly must be a good dame to look after the linen , and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read
1	and yet after each such conversation , i was more troubled than before
1	the horses and droshky were sent away
1	it was true that she now felt oppressed and bored , very bored ; afanasy ivanovich had divined her dreams ; she would like to resurrect , if not in love , then in a family , with the consciousness of a new purpose ; but of gavrila ardalionovich she could say almost nothing
1	he looked to see if the dish of broad beans was still there : the dish of broad beans had disappeared
1	i shall have to pull a long face with him too , he thought , with a beating heart , and he turned white , and do it naturally , too
1	on the dark height of the fourth floor , the unknown lady knocked at the door—it opened , and they went in together
1	having wept , talked , and wiped their tears , the two friends went up to prince andrei 's door
1	am i free now , this minute , or am i no longer free ?
1	well , as for the gentleman who thrashed the german , i feel no sympathy with him , because after all what need is there for sympathy ?
1	his state of mind was placid , submissive ; he willingly obeyed , and when varvara nikolaevna—that was his friend 's name—decided to take him to the crimea , he agreed , though he had a presentiment that nothing good would come of this trip
1	dounia lowered the revolver and looked at svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement
1	to‐day , he repeated to himself
1	i suppose it was from stupidity , because shame could still have been surmounted
1	tell katerina not to abandon our son !
1	so you have no friends in paris , m
1	if you wish , what 's most characteristic here is that it 's possible to draw any logical conclusion you like , but to up and shoot oneself as the result of a conclusion—that , of course , does not happen all the time
1	they were cut off from the path of retreat to the left by the french line
1	even if you were not my father , still you would never make me betray my beloved , faithful husband
1	i : the three presents of m d'artagnan sr on the first monday of the month of april , the village of meung , where the author of the romance of the rose was born , seemed to be in as total an upheaval as if the huguenots had come to make a second la rochelle
1	raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd , stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh
1	what nonsense all around !
1	it was decidedly humiliating to listen further , but my curiosity was invincibly enticed
1	he added with a bitter smile
1	the four companions cried with one voice , we would get ourselves cut to pieces for your majesty
1	which is why it 's a sin , prince , for people such as you not to serve now
1	in all he was clearly a sloven : his gloveless hands were dirty , and his long nails were in mourning
1	perhaps i know more about it than you do
1	when schroeder left , she suddenly said to me again , looking at me terribly seriously :
1	here , la porte , said buckingham , these are the only tokens i had from her , this silver box and these two letters
1	there was nowhere to hide
1	and do not you order anything in your own name ?
1	and meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much , though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away
1	they both began talking , but the prince suddenly started to shout , as if in strong irritation , reaching the point of fury
1	but at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again , as though his conscience smote him
1	they are all generals ' daughters , it seems , but they have all snub noses , interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face , wearing a loose coat
1	i am a man of experience , immense experience , sir , and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self‐approval
1	and then he turned to pierre
1	the girl 's tongue , lips , and whole mouth got covered with a sort of fine white rash , and towards evening she died , gazing at me with her big dark eyes , as if she already understood
1	bjoring 's shouting was addressed to anna andreevna , who also came out to the corridor after the prince ; he threatened her and , i believe , stamped his feet—in short , the coarse german soldier told in him , despite all his high society
1	all this he absolutely had to think over quickly ; it was now clear that he had not imagined anything at the station either , and that something absolutely real had happened to him , which was absolutely connected with all his earlier uneasiness
1	but dostoevsky was uncertain about what would follow , and he continued in that uncertainty all the while he was writing the novel
1	why are you here ?
1	said the old man , looking at her rounded waist
1	he 's alive , said napoleon
1	in that case , you would not have brought me to the necessity of a refusal
1	she shook her finger at him
1	i do not know him , and besides , he 's an englishman
1	he was a very strange despot
1	what about the bridge ?
1	walking behind the liveried footman who made way through the crowd before her mother , natasha heard a young man 's voice saying of her in much too loud a whisper :
1	in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother , when a service was held in memory of his grandmother , who had long been dead , and whom he had never seen
1	finally , liza died , on a beautiful summer evening , together with the setting sun , and only then did velchaninov seem to recover himself
1	you do not mean you are drinking this now ?
1	he was terribly certain that i would not escape ; he held and supported me with relish , like a dear little victim , and i , of course , was just what he needed , precisely that evening and in that condition !
1	and pierre , trying fearfully to recall whether he had done anything reprehensible , blushed and looked around him
1	on the third night , the countess calmed down for a few minutes , and natasha closed her eyes , resting her head on the arm of the chair
1	besides that , the whole staff of the russian army was now transformed
1	though he 's a drunk man , like as if unconscious , still it 's no good in front of a little child ; youngling as she is , she will still get it in her mind !
1	the poor artist 's heart began to pound harder
1	well , i kept expecting you , and so it was , you came !
1	and , besides , you must agree that all your outbursts downstairs , instead of falling on me , as you meant , only tyrannized and tormented her
1	it 's partly what made me ill in short , he shouted , feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place , in short , kindly examine me or let me go , at once
1	at the same time i had thoughts of mme
1	generally , i recall some of my outbursts in those minutes with great displeasure
1	how is it true ?
1	i have already been apprised of that , monseigneur , cried bonacieux , giving his questioner the title he had heard the officer give him , but i swear to you that i know nothing about it
1	his face is turned three-quarters to us now , and poorly lit , but when he turns this way , look at his forehead
1	so laughing , they entered porfiry petrovitch 's flat
1	in the room , not a small one incidentally , there were upward of thirty guests
1	i dreamed a dream that was completely unexpected for me , because i had never had one like it
1	at the start of the mazurka , boris saw the adjutant general balashov , one of the closest persons to the sovereign , go up to him and in uncourtly fashion stop very close to the sovereign , who was talking with a polish lady
1	milady replied to his question with another question
1	they finally arrived , opened the doors to the house and the front hall wide , and with loud laughter dragged the sack inside
1	i do not know really what to say
1	he did not take his eyes off her face all the while we crossed
1	well , maybe that ’ s how it should be … and you also didn ’ t answer my letter then … well , good-bye and forgive me for bothering you
1	i loved and respected him , and i sympathize with you wholeheartedly
1	up and down the length of one of its great stairways , on the site of which our civilization could build an entire house , moved a procession of paris solicitors seeking some sort of favor , provincial gentlemen anxious to enlist , and lackeys decked out in all colors , who came to bring m de tréville messages from their masters
1	asked natasha , seizing her hand
1	only i have no idea where to make my start
1	bolkonsky noticed the hussar 's state and found it amusing
1	now it only remains for me not to ruin the finale
1	quand j'ai compris ce qu'il voulait , quand j'ai vu qu'il nous faisait une litière de lauriers , voyez-vous , je me suis dit : voilà un souverain , et je me suis donné à lui
1	tomorrow there will be no more time !
1	go that way , your honor , here you will get killed straight off , a soldier cried to him
1	no , rodion romanovitch , i am not mistaken
1	prince vassily 's son , he and a certain dolokhov , they say , were up to god knows what
1	he looked around at the darkness , shook his head convulsively , and asked :
1	in my opinion , it is not only not noble , but even vile
1	d'artagnan and athos took the horses of planchet and grimaud , and the two valets set out on foot , carrying the saddles on their heads
1	trudolyubov struck up some stupid song
1	having accompanied olenka to the gate , he said good-bye and went on
1	that love filled all her soul , became an inalienable part of her , and she no longer fought against it
1	i wo not describe in detail what happened with mama : scared to death , she stood with her hands raised and clasped above her and suddenly called out after him : andrei petrovich , come back at least to say good-bye , dear !
1	ah , she will say , 'so young , but he 's got character
1	i called on him yesterday , he didn ’ t receive me , was unwell , but he ’ s rich , rich and important , and … god grant him a long life , but all the same evgeny pavlych will get everything … yes , yes … but even so i ’ m afraid !
1	but if there ’ ll be no gratitude from you , then the prince can also say in answer to you that he feels no gratitude towards pavlishchev , because pavlishchev did good for the satisfaction of his own conscience
1	i gave him two lines and forgot about it at once
1	most likely he spent the night in the scales hotel , very near here
1	said the boy , blushing deeply and looking up at pierre with admiring , shining eyes
1	it 's very easy to judge a man in disgrace and shift the mistakes of others onto him ; but i say that if there was anything good done during this reign , it was done by him—by him alone he stopped , seeing pierre
1	it would seem impossible to draw oneself up more than timokhin had drawn himself up when the regimental commander reprimanded him
1	humaneness will save everything and keep it afloat
1	in perplexity , i ask myself : can it be that this old , very stout , ungainly woman with a dull expression of petty care and fear over a crust of bread , with eyes clouded by constant thoughts of debt and poverty , only capable of talking about expenses and only smiling at bargains—can it be that this woman was once that same slender varya whom i passionately loved for her good , clear mind , her pure soul , her beauty , and , as othello loved desdemona , that she did pity my science ?
1	( he had been standing there and waiting )
1	it was clear that she was stirred to the very depths , that she was longing to speak , to champion , to express something
1	read this , she said , handing him ganya ’ s note
1	nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup
1	you told me to
1	c'est un homme qui a été plus qu'un père pour moi
1	she said quickly , meeting him in the middle of the room
1	the general arrived late , arrived scowling , arrived with evgeny pavlovich , who was received excellently , and evgeny pavlovich himself was surprisingly merry and nice
1	of the young people , not including the countess 's elder daughter ( who was four years older than her sister and already behaved like an adult ) , and the young lady guest , only nikolai and the niece sonya remained in the drawing room
1	but it can ’ t be that you thought of it , you just sensed it , as i did … we sensed it word for word then
1	why , people in perfect health act in the same way too , observed dounia , looking uneasily at zossimov
1	i have posed many questions , but there is one most important question which , i will note , i have never dared to ask my mother directly , though i have become quite close to her over the last year and , moreover , as a crude and ungrateful pup who finds them guilty before him , have been quite unceremonious with her
1	athos had passed through all the trials we have seen bonacieux undergo
1	but i did ask her to remember 'thy servant rodion ' in her prayers , the idea struck him
1	one of pierre 's acquaintances , in the middle of talking about the weather , asked him whether he had heard about kuragin 's abduction of miss rostov , of which there was talk in town , and whether it was true
1	the confession was soon over
1	at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak ; for two days he had scarcely tasted food
1	stepping full on his heels—we know about that
1	the policeman said , nothing , and at once turned to go back
1	versilov recounted it all jokingly and with extraordinary merriment , so that even mama burst out laughing ; he impersonated tatyana pavlovna , and the midshipman , and the cook
1	rostov felt both frightened and elated to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance , where no one had been before him
1	i do not know anyone or anything here
1	listen , athos , said d'artagnan , instead of keeping yourself locked up here as if you were under arrest , get on a horse and come for an outing with me to saint-germain
1	shall i put the sock on ?
1	well , generally , talk as much as possible
1	here 's how to do it , said boris
1	suddenly touchard himself came in and , with a foolishly important air , asked her : was she pleased with her son 's progress ?
1	but what is she—a nihilist , or simply a fool ?
1	any order from him—this he knew— would be approved by all against one or a few
1	she kept jumping up , impulsively embracing his head , and showering it with kisses
1	you should lie down , she said
1	some laughed at this subject , others declared that nothing could be loftier , but in order to portray the poor knight ’ there had in any case to be a face
1	but know that i adore your daughter and your whole family so much that i would give two lives he looked at the countess and , noticing her stern face good-bye , countess , he said , kissed her hand , and , without looking at natasha , with quick , resolute steps , left the room
1	stay here , and i will go
1	no , this i can not allow ; no , i truly can not !
1	having gone several steps , the officer , as if deciding to himself that the quarters were good , stopped , turned around to the soldiers who were standing in the doorway , and in a loud , commanding voice called to them to bring the horses
1	in short , wherever you turned , there was nothing but losses everywhere
1	but listen , brother , allow me to ask your name and patronymic ?
1	pierre , who was becoming more and more agitated during this conversation , got up and went over to the princess
1	rogozhin suddenly abandoned the painting and went further on his way
1	meet me at the hôtel of the guards
1	that 's something unheard of !
1	if there 's the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth , it leads to a discord , and that leads to trouble
1	for marriage he needed his father 's consent , and for that prince andrei set off the next day to see his father
1	arakcheev 's eyes turned towards him
1	the result of this acquired habit thus was that , on the first monday of the month of april , the townsmen , hearing noise , and seeing neither the yellow-and-red standard , nor the livery of the duc de richelieu , rushed for the jolly miller inn
1	it is too painful for me to think that i could be the cause of grief or discord in the family of my benefactors , she wrote , and my love has no other aim than the happiness of those i love ; and so i beg you , nicolas , to consider yourself free and to know that , despite all , no one can love you more than—your sonya
1	perhaps you don ’ t want to accept my proposal ?
1	is he in earnest ?
1	they served a panikhida in the morning and in the evening
1	she fell in love with you then , ever since that time , that birthday party
1	because of this figure of omission , i , in my lack of skill , have fallen back into those novelistic beauties that i myself derided above
1	she whispers , good-bye , yegor vlasych !
1	[ ] and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades
1	he had even let slip three days earlier , though timidly and remotely , that he was afraid of her coming on account of me—that is , that on account of me he would get a scolding
1	ah , here she is !
1	certainly , if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity , he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself
1	that 's not our business
1	i can almost hear her
1	what did he mean to say by his suggestion today ?
1	but let us turn to him
1	she did , i say , go chase the wind in the field !
1	a thousand thanks , dear friend , for the work you have sent me , and which is causing such a furor there
1	how quickly time flies !
1	interrupting each other , they all hastened to tell the beauty some new thing , unloaded their sacks and boasted about the loaves , sausages , and dumplings , of which they had already collected plenty for their caroling
1	softer , softer now , fade away
1	and … and there ’ ll be more !
1	we shall see the good porthos again , so much the better
1	why do you ask all this ?
1	do not let me find a trace of you in my room !
1	she was maintained in this delusion by the fact that , first of all , she had become a very rich bride , and second , that the older she became , the less dangerous she was for men , the more freely men treated her and , without taking any obligations upon themselves , profited from her suppers , soirées , and the lively company that gathered in her house
1	a madcap does not want to listen
1	you do not get money every day ?
1	besides , on bonacieux 's honor your name is bonacieux ?
1	oh , now it ’ s all one to me , now i have no time to be angry , but then , then , i repeat , i literally chewed my pillow at night and tore my blanket with rage
1	nevertheless , the old prince took great interest in them and especially liked one of these princes , the head of the family , so to speak— a young officer
1	one might even say it 's their only amusement
1	and be gentle with him , but … don ’ t let it show too much , and … and … you know …
1	the expression of her face was not entirely kind , but imposing ; twenty-two years old
1	he began , now that they were reconciled , beginning at once to think aloud in his wife 's presence
1	first he addressed the gray-haired cossack who was grieving over his father and mother : what 's there to cry about , uncle , he said , i am an orphan myself !
1	no , you see , there was this manuscript
1	but not like that !
1	i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler 's for a rouble and a half
1	i have no fiancé , i refused him , cried natasha
1	we have got to go , then ?
1	and they told me you had moved somewhere , to another apartment , that you got frightened and ran away
1	cried the bandit , throwing himself on his knees and leaning on his hand , for he was beginning to lose his strength along with his blood
1	anisim brought that time , they are his present
1	suddenly there was a crackle and boom that to pierre seemed louder than the most terrible peals of thunder , and he turned to look
1	but are the two men not essentially alike ?
1	he remembered how his grandfather always went to the forest to fetch a christmas tree for the masters and took his grandson with him
1	then i started talking with them , talking every day , whenever i had a chance
1	a mounted cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy
1	since those secrets may have an influence on your life , those secrets must become mine
1	fresh as that memory was , rastopchin felt that it was now deeply , bloodily engraved in his heart
1	the most vexing thing is that we will have to die here as well
1	though stupidity constitutes a special charm in a pretty wife
1	meanwhile , i must confess , since we had not counted on staying so long , we would already been without money for some time
1	he starts quietly , tenderly : aremember , gretchen , how you , still innocent , still a child , used to come with your mama to this cathedral and prattle out your prayers from an old book ?
1	one of them said in a thundering voice , seizing him by the collar
1	prince andrei galloped off to carry out his mission
1	prince andrei came into the room and stopped before her , at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying
1	this cloud you have made too loud—it 's not evening light
1	it seems the whole world is looking at me , hiding and waiting for me to understand it
1	elle est forte celle-là , he said
1	she cried , clasping her hands , your husband drunken horses have trampled !
1	the former i treat benignly ; the latter i grill for the whole year
1	take away my gun , i will get a fishing pole , take away the fishing pole , i will hunt bare-handed
1	sonia looked in silence at her visitor , who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room , and even began at last to tremble with terror , as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies
1	but don ’ t you see they ’ ve all lost their minds from pride and vanity ?
1	they began to whistle , clap their hands , and laugh , and marie ran away
1	having questioned several petitioners , the general raised his eyes to cherviakov
1	she 's had some dealings with satan
1	yes , i am certainly a louse , he went on , clutching at the idea , gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure
1	send for the doctor !
1	however , everything was still mixed up in his head
1	the level of the political thermometer shown to the company that evening was the following : however hard all european sovereigns and military leaders try to pander to bonapartius , in order to cause me , and us in general , unpleasantness and grief , our opinion of bonapartius can not change
1	a man perhaps of feeling and sympathy , maybe of some knowledge too , but my day is over
1	i suddenly and unexpectedly perceived that he had long known who i was , and maybe knew much more as well
1	that has been done with us as well , and it 's splendid
1	having swallowed a little , she had become so frightened that she had awakened sonya and told her what she had done
1	i will stop and explain everything beforehand ; otherwise it will be impossible for the reader to understand
1	so the hôtel is far away ?
1	a new horizon , new works would unfold , all filled with well-being and the propserity of all
1	what else did he say to you ?
1	they began talking about lizaveta
1	i must find out
1	and why would it not be slow in coming ?
1	did i know it then , sir ?
1	after about twenty minutes a pardon was read out to him , and he was given a lesser degree of punishment ; nevertheless , for the space between the two sentences , for twenty minutes , or a quarter of an hour at the least , he lived under the certain conviction that in a few minutes he would suddenly die
1	athos was standing in front of the door , wrapped in his cloak , his hat pulled down over his eyes
1	you give up everything , all your will
1	and they are hungry , hungry ! —and wringing her hands she pointed to the children
1	they counted me chapter six out a hundred and forty half-imperials in gold
1	or , rather , you are insulting me , she went on , gripping the arms of the chair with her clenched hands and raising herself on her wrists
1	it struck you as extraordinary ; i do not mind betting it 's that
1	yes , it was the same flesh , the same chair à canon , the sight of which already then , as if foretelling the present , had filled him with horror
1	he says , 'you are a drunkard , he says , 'you stink of onions , you are a blockhead , a son of a bitch
1	yes , there 's also natasha began
1	the three musketeers the young man turned around quickly , for this attack could not be coming from the bastion , which was masked by the corner of the trench
1	the buildings , begun in the lean time , were more than simple
1	or , if you please , perhaps the gentlemen officers can come along ?
1	dmitri prokofitch razumihin , she added , introducing him to luzhin
1	that all this had suddenly become something else—well , had turned out totally unlike his dream on the planks that evening
1	medicine 's that sort of thing , you have to grind away at it
1	no , you ’ re not at all as simple as they recommend you to be !
1	the princess turned to her and , trying to stifle the animosity for this girl that arose in her heart , kissed her
1	d'artagnan went to say good-bye to m de tréville
1	that is , i did lie , because the document was with me and had never been with kraft , but that was merely a detail , while in the main thing i did not lie , because the moment i lied , i promised myself to burn the letter that very evening
1	i hear sympathy in your voice , at the first sight of you i thought for some reason that i could talk with you about everything
1	were you quick in getting here ?
1	and he could no longer say a word , he understood nothing , and imagined that he was now a simple , ordinary man , walking briskly , merrily across the fields , tapping his stick , and over him was the broad sky , flooded with sunlight , and he was free as a bird and could go wherever he liked !
1	yes , apropos of something … then i told them how i ’ d lived there for three years , and also the story of a poor village girl …
1	he was thinking about all the vanity of his diplomatic career compared with pierre 's happiness
1	hearing that , sonya blushed so much that tears came to her eyes
1	he believed in his hatred of her to such an extent that he even suddenly thought of falling in love with and marrying her stepdaughter , who had been deceived by the prince , persuaded himself completely of this new love , and got the poor idiot girl to fall in love with him irresistibly , making her completely happy by this love during the last months of her life
1	it was as if this laughter echoed all at once in his heart and in his quietly aroused nerves , and at the same time vexation came over his soul that it was not in his power to cover this so nicely laughing face with kisses
1	do not say it , good sir
1	the countess exchanged glances with sonya
1	i am sorry for liza
1	she 's a very worthy girl , and you always liked her ; but now there are suddenly some sort of reasons
1	what was to be done ?
1	there , there was strife and logic ; there the frenchman was only a frenchman , and the german only a german , and that with a greater intensity than at any time in their entire history ; meaning that a frenchman never did more harm to france , or a german to his germany , than at that time !
1	several infantrymen ran to the kutafyevsky gates
1	the prince bared his teeth
1	that is your name ?
1	oh , yes , she said , and her glance added , did you notice anything ?
1	will i see you again before you leave ?
1	i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think : though katerina ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady amalia fyodorovna only a week before , she could not resist then asking her in to coffee
1	and , assuming a most worldly pose ( god knows where and when she had learned it ) , fanning herself and smiling through the fan , she talked with her partner
1	i mean the one that was under the little trunk , and the one that was in the sledge in the yard i unscrewed along with mitrofan
1	would you have surrendered the letter , aramis ?
1	are they both dead , then ?
1	but i ca not know the divine providence and why do you ask what ca not be answered ?
1	at one point , for instance , versilov advises him : my friend , always let a man lie a little - it 's innocent
1	i wanted to say something important , but i got confused , he said
1	incidentally , i do not know or understand lambert 's relation with the pockmarked one , and why lambert could not do without him
1	such nice things are commonly said when one wants to justify one 's indifference ,
1	mama , are you asleep ?
1	sign the order to set him free , and all will be said , the cardinal picked up
1	listening to this multilingual talk , and these suggestions , plans , and refutations , and shouts , prince andrei was simply amazed at what they all said
1	non , mais figurez-vous , la vieille comtesse zouboff avec des fausses boucles et la bouche pleine de fausses dents , comme si elle voulait défier les années [ ] ha , ha , ha , marie !
1	there 's no hurry , there 's no hurry , muttered porfiry petrovitch , moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim , as it were making dashes towards the window , the bureau and the table , at one moment avoiding raskolnikov 's suspicious glance , then again standing still and looking him straight in the face
1	i do not feel right about money
1	sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk , that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters , that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when , seeing that he had guessed the truth , she told him at last of her death , she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it , not externally at any rate
1	all just like the palm of your hand
1	but for god 's sake be more careful : you know what a shock it may give your maman
1	not heeding the officers , the bearers stood leaning on the stretchers and , as if trying to comprehend the difficult meaning of the spectacle , looked intently at what was going on before them
1	among those present this time there were some who were prepared to sit even till morning without saying a word , for instance , varvara ardalionovna , who sat a little apart all evening , silent and listening all the while with extreme curiosity , and who may have had her own reasons for doing so
1	she take it , she ?
1	but ivan nikiforovich , frightened to have gone so far from home and to have endured such a dangerous quarantine , had already managed to get through the door , saying : ukrainian tales do not trouble yourself , it 's my pleasure
1	pierre noted that he was pale and his lower jaw was twitching and shaking as in a fever
1	that may be , i agree , only i don ’ t remember , prince shch
1	well , is everything ready , vassilyich ?
1	natasha suddenly asked , after a moment 's silence
1	pierre stood up to help the servant
1	god sent a pie-e-ece of che-e-ese
1	princess marya went up and kissed his hand
1	you saw him , he was melting with pleasure
1	a kind old man , but a very pauvre sire
1	stay a little , i wo not talk nonsense , about myself , i mean
1	he would transfer the question to metaphysical heights , go on to definitions of space , time , thought , and , deriving his refutations from there , descend again to the ground of the argument
1	devil take that indecent moment !
1	you know i am having a house‐warming this evening , i dare say they have arrived by now , but i left my uncle there—i just ran in—to receive the guests
1	we all remained standing
1	the sun is already high , and you have no dinner ready
1	ganechka also did not mention a word about the affair of pavlishchev ’ s son , perhaps out of false modesty , perhaps sparing the prince ’ s feelings , but all the same the prince thanked him again for having diligently concluded the affair
1	wishing to ask someone among these people where the commander in chief was , he rode up to the baggage train
1	at pontoise he changed mounts a last time , and at nine o'clock he came galloping into m de tréville 's courtyard
1	why no , not in the least , said boris
1	at eight o'clock i went to the office
1	sometimes in the evening he wraps himself in his robe and , trembling all over , teeth chattering , begins pacing rapidly from corner to corner and between the beds
1	if all russians are at least a little like you , he said to pierre , c'est un sacrilege que de faire la guerre à un peuple comme le vôtre
1	he stopped , silently looking around him
1	it 's time to put an end to it all : perish my soul , i will go and drown myself in a hole in the ice and pass out of the picture !
1	yegor puts his cap on the back of his head and , clucking for his dog , continues on his way
1	she did not seem afraid of svidrigaïlov , but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes
1	and to andrei petrovich , too , he confirmed as hard as he could that you would stay , and he assured anna andreevna of it
1	one arm rose to take hold of the windowsill , but lowered itself again
1	three days would go by without the stove being lit
1	she 's so kind , and maman loves her so
1	a personal meeting , to the joy and pride of the whole army , was refused , and instead of the sovereign , prince dolgorukov , the victor at wischau , was sent with savary to negotiate with napoleon , on the chance that these negotiations , contrary to expectation , had as their purpose a real desire for peace
1	she just knew you ’ d spend the whole evening with the other one
1	the subject he chose was the nativity of jesus
1	an hour later the order was issued in london that no ship laden for france was to be allowed to leave port , not even the mail boat
1	his face expressed calm piety and submission to the will of god
1	porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar ; d'artagnan , still unseen , leaned on the other side
1	the fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible
1	but he sat motionless at the table , kept silent , and refused to speak
1	together with this refusal of the colonel , he decided that it was necessary to employ a ruse so that , on leaving orel , he could make the italian officer accept some money , which he clearly needed
1	she went up to them
1	good people , have pity on me , an orphan
1	i ca not understand how you dare utter her name in my presence , if you really are svidrigaïlov
1	the bared trees , and the sand , and the stones , and the roofs of the houses , and the green spire of the church , and the angles of the distant white house—all this was etched with unnatural distinctness , with the finest lines , in the transparent air
1	she says it all right in my face
1	so he went to find the queen , and , as was his habit , accosted her with new threats against those who surrounded her
1	came from the crowd
1	he said that after the sixteenth he could not answer for anything
1	i am done for !
1	ah , how frightful it is !
1	pustovalov and olenka , once they were married , had a good life
1	i missed astonishing chances and tried not to get angry , but to succeed by coolheadedness and confidence
1	) , but the thing is that he was deceived , that ’ s why i insist that he be vindicated ; that ’ s why i say that he deserves to be pitied in his simplicity , and can not be left without support ; otherwise he , too , will come out as a crook in this affair
1	she instantly placed under the luckless man 's head a pillow , which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him
1	but for pierre this bright star with its long , luminous tail did not arouse any frightening feeling
1	it came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked
1	but russia is such a wondrous land that , if you say something about one collegiate assessor , all collegiate assessors , from riga to kamchatka , will unfailingly take it to their own account
1	well , you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score ; but there 's another thing worries me
1	if the uttering of this word without any witnesses had put ivan ivanovich beside himself and in such a rage as god keep us from ever seeing in any man—what now , only consider , gentle readers , what now , when this deadly word was uttered in a gathering that included many ladies , before whom ivan ivanovich liked to be especially proper ?
1	however , as you wish he was obviously displeased
1	i hope no one receives him here , despite his wealth
1	there could not be a better chance
1	of course , i could not put anything together then , but all the same i remember it
1	i turned to him from the sledge
1	felton named the baron de winter , the unknown man would name no one , and declared that he would make himself known to the duke alone
1	not painfully , by god !
1	and you , my dear , you really suspected nothing all the while ?
1	it happens not seldom in the world that the earth shakes from one end to the other : learned people say it is because somewhere by the sea there is a mountain out of which flames burst and burning rivers flow
1	you needn ’ t worry , there will be no tears or entreaties , as before , at least not on my part
1	but my nose really has vanished !
1	oh , it poured out by itself quite effortlessly
1	another pretext was her snuff , which seemed to her now dry , now damp , now poorly rubbed
1	you must get some rest , your serenity , said schneider
1	i would thus find myself more at ease , facilius natans , with a subject of my own choice , which would be to these tough theological questions what ethics is to metaphysics in philosophy
1	we were present at the scene of the two captives ' confrontation
1	to let me go first
1	but i did not guess , and a wicked feeling took hold of meyou just wait , i thought
1	his life there , however , was excellent
1	he had clearly forgotten all about pierre
1	it means that i am sick to death of you all and i want to be alone , raskolnikov answered calmly
1	can it be that this worthless oksana will never get out of my head ?
1	choub goggled his eyes when the blacksmith came in , and did not know which to marvel at : that the blacksmith had resurrected , or that the blacksmith had dared to come to him , or that he had got himself up so foppishly as a zaporozhye cossack
1	cousinage dangereux voisinage , [ ] she added
1	no , what i said to you , bonacieux picked up , was only so as to know if we will be coming home late
1	you hint at a crime committed , you say , by my brother
1	there 's a smell of hay and of something else very good
1	for more than twenty years you have had free quarters , with heat , light , servants , besides having the right to work as you want and as much as you want , or even not to work at all
1	he himself had spent the past night lying on the sofa
1	i do not want to and i wo not
1	he might still have a struggle to come with svidrigaïlov
1	if she shows pure repentance and changes her life , then i will marry her
1	you should have taken him to the police station all the same , said the man in the long coat
1	that shows it 's not locked , but fastened with the hook !
1	then he remembered rogozhin himself : recently at the burial , then in the park , then—suddenly here in the corridor , when he had hidden himself in the corner that time and waited for him with a knife
1	when the soup had been brought , and he had begun upon it , nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting
1	katerina ivanovna was busy with the dying man ; she was giving him water , wiping the blood and sweat from his head , setting his pillow straight , and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest
1	inquiring of madame lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while katerina ivanovna was away at the cemetery , he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair , that all the lodgers had been invited , among them some who had not known the dead man , that even andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel with katerina ivanovna , that he , pyotr petrovitch , was not only invited , but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers
1	[ ] they sent the german pahlen to new york , to america , to fetch the frenchman moreau , [ ] he said , alluding to the invitation made to moreau that year to enter the russian service , wonders ! !
1	leave us to ourselves , without a book , and we will immediately get confused , lost – we wo not know what to join , what to hold to , what to love and what to hate , what to respect and what to despise
1	the wolf ran on and jumped heavily over a hole that lay in his path
1	nevertheless , he graduated successfully , because he had his protectors
1	pierre unfolded the cool napkin and , deciding to break the silence , glanced at natasha and princess marya
1	at last , faltering and continually glancing at her daughter , she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance
1	he then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted
1	they broke two squares , your excellency
1	though he had beaten me two years part one earlier , he had always needed me , not only for his boots ; he used to tell me everything
1	yes , but i forgot i really must go home things to do pierre said hurriedly
1	sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code
1	you asked for me , my young friend ?
1	his chest was covered with a coat of mail
1	mama always told me about everything at home , usually when she came with soup to feed me ( when i still could not eat by myself ) , in order to entertain me ; while i persistently tried to show each time that this information had little interest for me , and therefore i did not ask for any details about nastasya egorovna , and even remained quite silent
1	something awkward , at any rate , can be noticed in him each time he achieves some such goal
1	she stands pale , motionless as a statue , and catches his every step with her eyes
1	you will be no better off for that !
1	in the end they very often become disappointed
1	he plays on the different uses of the word ( who wants to want according to a little table ?
1	why , have you been a card‐sharper then ?
1	it was evident that all was not yet over
1	for my own part , i will observe that almost every actuality , though it has its immutable laws , is almost always incredible and implausible
1	dear women , dear girls , love the rich carpenter !
1	on the eleventh of october , , one of the infantry regiments just arrived in braunau had halted half a mile from the town , waiting to be reviewed by the commander in chief
1	i ’ ll kneel down and grovel at his feet until he does , otherwise i won ’ t leave !
1	and the queen brought her beautiful hand to her bodice
1	planchet followed his master 's movement , exactly as if he was his shadow , and found himself trotting beside him
1	the blacksmith looked distractedly around the corners of the room , catching from time to time the far-resounding songs of the carolers
1	there is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist
1	julie was preparing to leave moscow the next day and was giving a farewell soirée
1	mrs belov praised the gifts and admired her cotton fabric
1	every half hour , without taking his eyes off the book , he pours himself a glass of vodka and drinks it , then , without looking , feels for the pickle and takes a bite
1	in one instant his whole face as if melted into the sweetest smile
1	yes , you must have exaggerated !
1	it seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance , no trace of disgust , no tremor in her hand
1	i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty-fourth , but i thought that the sooner it happened , the surer it would be
1	i wo not , i wo not
1	sachez , monseigneur , pour tout ce qui a rapport à mes sentiments intimes , je ne rends compte qu ' à dieu et à ma conscience , [ ] she concluded , touching her high , beautiful breasts with her hand and glancing up at the sky
1	xxiii : the rendezvous so you think i have something to fear ?
1	she always addressed him with a joyful , trusting smile , meant for him alone , in which there was something more significant than what was in the general smile that always adorned her face
1	mavra kuzminishna sent me , they have brought some wounded officers , will you allow them to ?
1	the man 's asking for the sake of art , not for some trifle
1	they talked of battle and also did not believe in the nearness of battle
1	suddenly the already very drunk collaborator on the firebrand , who had been sitting in glum silence , addressed ivan ilyich directly and , his eyes flashing , began to reply on behalf of the whole company
1	then , casting a last glance at the handsome young man , who was barely twenty-five years old , and whom he left lying there , insensible and perhaps dead , he heaved a sigh over the strange destiny that leads men to xx : the journey destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist
1	when i came into my tiny closet , even though i had been waiting for him all those three days , my eyes clouded over , as it were , and my heart gave such a throb that i even stopped in the doorway
1	in his essay the storyteller ( ) , walter benjamin wrote : experience passed on from mouth to mouth is the source from which all storytellers have drawn
1	and the soldier passed by
1	bazin , who had remained standing and had listened to the whole controversy with pious jubilation , rushed to them , took the curate 's breviary and the jesuit 's missal , and walked respectfully ahead of them to clear the way
1	and there was the fourth storey , here was the door , here was the flat opposite , the empty one
1	in fact , as soon as the blizzard arose and the wind began cutting right into their eyes , choub showed repentance and , pulling his ear-flapped hat further down on his head , treated himself , the devil , and the chum to abuse
1	excuse me [ ] dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too late—translator
1	father andrei asked nina ivanovna
1	what was kovalev 's horror as well as amazement when he recognized him as his own nose !
1	he was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister , sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes , just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed
1	she evidently leaned all the way out of the window , because he could hear the rustle of her dress and even her breathing
1	the result of all this was that each of them wholeheartedly accepted the mission for which he had been summoned
1	finally they parted : once more gratitude , again guardian angel , again mitenka , and pavel pavlovich finally took his spouse and the uhlan to put them on the train
1	and everything was in order , except the footgear
1	he did not suspect , for instance , that the epanchins , having in mind such an important step as the deciding of their daughter ’ s fate , would not have dared not to show him , prince lev nikolaevich , to the little old dignitary , the acknowledged benefactor of their family
1	how often olga ivanovna herself had taken refuge behind that painting !
1	the wounded , waiting their turn by the tents , wheezed , moaned , wept , shouted , cursed , begged for vodka
1	the prince , incidentally , was greatly interested in his new guest who accompanied the general ; he guessed clearly that he was evgeny pavlovich radomsky , of whom he had heard so much and had thought more than once
1	you must tell me
1	she had a fortune , you know
1	m de tréville made them repeat this news twice , and each time his companions saw his face darken
1	they may be of use some time
1	but he still did not begin the action
1	excuse me , please , brother
1	give me , then , the strength to suffer
1	it would be much better for him
1	oh , she was smiling and joking ; but it was only from her immeasurable kindness , because her whole soul was filled at that moment , as i later realized , with such enormous care of her own and such strong and powerful feeling , that she could talk with me and answer my trifling , irksome questions only as one answers a little boy who has asked some importunate , childish question , in order to get rid of him
1	then he began to reflect on the events that had just occurred
1	he was also some sort of partner in these shares , and later he came to me from that gentleman in hamburg , with trifles , naturally , and i did not even know why myself , there was no mention of shares
1	if one ca not control one 's patients , how is one to cure them ?
1	cried d'artagnan , you could not possibly have arrived more opportunely ; the food wo not even have had time to get cold !
1	that must be true
1	everything about sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment
1	nastasya lighted them from a step below
1	i love you terribly , liza !
1	no , i am wrong ; that simplifies a great deal
1	but to protest right then would have meant breaking with them at once , which , though it did not frighten me at all , would have harmed my essential aims , and therefore i accepted the post silently for the time being , my silence protecting my dignity
1	( so all the frenchmen called pierre )
1	below them hang costly muskets , sabers , harquebuses , lances
1	this is a letter of that same stolbeev , following whose death a case arose between versilov and the princes sokolsky over his will
1	he not only was not interested in whether he would get to petersburg sooner or later , or whether he would or would not find a place to rest in this station , but , compared with the thoughts that occupied him then , it was all the same to him whether he spent a few hours or his whole life in this station
1	i do not even know with whom i am speaking , sir , pavel pavlovich added , i even think there is no reason for us to continue
1	from the very first i was brought up short there by a certain officer
1	and please do not think i am doing you a service ; quite the contrary , as soon as you came in , i saw how you could help me ; to begin with , i am weak in spelling , and secondly , i am sometimes utterly adrift in german , so that i make it up as i go along for the most part
1	that ’ s the highest independence of personal dignity , that means a direct challenge … no , it ’ s gigantic strength of spirit !
1	the smoke , especially thick because of the fog , at first prevented him from seeing anything ; but the other shot he was expecting did not follow
1	and he tried to draw him away , but he tore himself away from his hand , and , beside himself with horror , ran to the horse
1	he suddenly recollected himself
1	is that a polish mazughrka ?
1	it was indeed a miracle of the brush
1	bagration , knowing bolkonsky to be a favorite and trusted adjutant , received him with a superior officer 's special distinction and indulgence , explained to him that there would probably be a battle that day or the next , and allowed him full freedom to stay by him during the battle or to supervise the order of retreat in the rear guard , which was also very important
1	and what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be thirty‐two and able to begin a new life !
1	where are you going ?
1	or , for instance , once having imagined that so-and-so was afraid or ought to be afraid for such-and-such reason , he no longer doubted that the man was indeed afraid , as in an axiom
1	however , he had not lost sight of milady , and in the mirror caught the change that had just come over her face
1	prince andrei said in the same tone
1	his rooms were not entered directly from the passage , but through the landlady 's two almost empty rooms
1	then suddenly in the morning they come and tell me that marie is dead
1	she wanted to cry
1	in reality , all these movements forward and backward did nothing to alleviate or alter the situation of the troops
1	the evening will be fine , if only we do not have a storm
1	suddenly a bright light flashed into his room
1	and why , one asked , did she talk incessantly and laugh so much with sisoy , while with him , her son , she was serious , usually silent , bashful , which did not become her at all ?
1	she said , with the look of an exultant hawk
1	he has the strangest last name
1	it was nearly eight o'clock
1	he turns another way—there stands a third wife
1	indeed , it would be hard to impersonate any greater deference and self-satisfaction )
1	but no matter , another time !
1	however , aramis was in a good position and could still defend himself
1	what makes you conclude that she ’ ll reject me ?
1	natasha listened for a long time to the sounds that reached her from outside and inside , and did not stir
1	barclay de tolly tried to lead his army in the best fashion , so as to fulfill his duty and earn the glory of a great general
1	i sent uvarka to listen at dawn , his bass said after a moment 's silence
1	no , katerina , i told you your father was a bad man ; he does nothing in the orthodox way
1	ah , you are going to have a fight with lambert again !
1	now , that you can not say , my most gentle friend and benefactor—that i am trying to offend you
1	nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter
1	lizaveta prokofyevna asked sharply
1	will you stay if the enemy takes it ?
1	what deadly noose had tatyana let on about , sending me to anna andreevna ?
1	apart from the calculation which made anatole necessary for him , the very process of manipulating another person 's will was a pleasure , a habit , and a necessity for dolokhov
1	there i simply destroyed it : the soup i poured out the window into the nettles or a certain other place , the beef i either threw out the window to the dog , or wrapped in paper , put in my pocket , and took out later , well , and all the rest
1	humility , meekness , lowliness , and at the same time firmness , strength , real strength—that is your mother 's character
1	he said to raskolnikov , as they went out into the street
1	nobody makes frock coats from it
1	personal human feeling for a brief moment got the upper hand over that artificial phantom of life which he had served so long
1	am i not perhaps interfering with your pleasures ?
1	i did not want to question the landlady about anything , and had generally resolved to stop all contacts with them and even to move out of the apartment as soon as possible ; and therefore , the moment my coffee was brought , i latched the door again
1	all this seems to flash before me now
1	when i asked him myself , he told me that he had stopped loving you long ago , that even the memory of you was painful for him , but that he pitied you , and that when he remembered you , his heart felt pierced forever
1	and i , of course , as is my custom , will turn coward , start mincing before her , covering myself with the skirts of my dressing gown , start smiling , start lying
1	the day after that , the drums beat assembly
1	it 's unpleasant but my fiancée you must come to berg went on ; he was about to say to dinner , but changed his mind and said to tea , and with a quick movement of his tongue let out a small , round smoke ring that fully embodied his dreams of happiness
1	akhmakov has come , and they have got a pistol !
1	a boat , a boat was shouted in the crowd
1	oh , in her frenzy she cries constantly that she does not acknowledge her guilt , that she is the victim of people , the victim of a debaucher and a villain ; but whatever she tells you , know that she is the first not to believe it herself and that , on the contrary , she believes with all her conscience that she herself … is the guilty one
1	biblical tradition says that absence of work—idleness—was the condition of the first man 's blessedness before his fall
1	he came here at once after his wife 's funeral
1	and the hay is so tall , soft , rich !
1	for the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale
1	they hastened to ask and answer each other about a thousand little things that could interest only them
1	i could rest here
1	yes , she assented in a faint voice
1	that 's all we need
1	before i could blink an eye , he snatched the revolver from lambert and hit him on the head with it as hard as he could
1	but since the time of her visit , the old countess began to talk about her several times a day
1	was all he was able to utter with failing breath
1	he made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen
1	three times it was , we all heard it , shouted a third
1	just as you will sometimes meet on their unfinished landscape a nymph painted upside down , which the artist , finding no other place , sketched on the dirty background of an old work he once delighted in painting
1	this was raevsky , who had spent the whole day at the main point of the field of borodino
1	the countess was to wear a damson velvet dress , and the two girls white gauze dresses over pink silk slips , with roses at the bodice
1	what moves may always rise
1	and do not tell me any lies because can it be that they will take me away from here ?
1	in spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them , in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days , she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner , interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady
1	i am now almost convinced of it
1	they gave him the whole of europe and came to teach us !
1	well , and can i , do i have the right to regard such a slanderer , such a harlot , one might say , and monster , as my own nephew , the only son of my late sister anisya ?
1	but he sat down again for a second game
1	come , i say , and do not be afraid , athos went on
1	and i absolutely wanted to , because i was told
1	it was already late , petya had eaten nothing , he was streaming with sweat ; but he would not go home , and together with the diminished but still quite large crowd , stood before the palace , looking through the palace windows while the sovereign dined , expecting something further , and equally envious both of the dignitaries who drove up to the entrance , to the sovereign 's dinner , and of the palace footmen who served at the table and flitted past the windows
1	i love the solemnity of boredom—however , i have already told you that
1	the three musketeers i am not joking , replied athos
1	the closer he came , the more strongly , far more strongly ( as if moral feeling was also subject to the law of attraction , which increases in inverse proportion to the square of the distance ) , he thought of his home ; at the last station before otradnoe , he gave the driver three roubles for vodka and soon , breathless as a boy , was running up the front porch of the house
1	we passed just by the park , saw two deer , and such a wonderful house !
1	she did not cry when , at the moment of taking leave of her , he kissed her hand for the last time
1	there , you see , i have caught you out
1	the prince simply trembled
1	what have they come here for , i ask you ?
1	yet he turned his eyes to the coffin every other moment , as if asking the inadvertent question : what if she rises , what if she gets up ?
1	dron came and confirmed dunyasha 's words : the muzhiks had come on the princess 's orders
1	fair enough , said athos
1	i thought today 's fête was cancelled
1	finally , when i had drunk two cups , tatyana pavlovna suddenly got up , took a pair of scissors from the table , and said : give me your pocket , we must take out the letter—we ca not cut it with her here !
1	i asked suddenly , as if losing my reason
1	good thoughts and sound decisions to you !
1	the count led the male guests to his study , to offer them his prize collection of turkish pipes
1	that ’ s all i need for at least two weeks
1	and you went there on his invitation , imprudent as you are !
1	she was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six , with brown hair and blue eyes , a slightly upturned nose , admirable teeth , a marbled complexion of rose and opal
1	i ask myself : should i not , indeed , consult one of my colleagues ?
1	anyhow , the roofs are all thatched with rushes ; a willow , an oak , and two apple trees lean on them with their spreading branches
1	it will be freezing cold and everything became still
1	i ’ m very glad you want to resemble a human being
1	look , look , said this adjutant , looking not at the distant troops , but down the hill in front of him
1	but , tell me , how could kraft 's deduction weaken the striving for the general human cause ?
1	just what he wants , you may be sure , but once take him up , you wo not get rid of him we know the sort !
1	obviously unwillingly , with the painful certainty that he would not be understood , he voiced his thought more than once in the most varied circumstances
1	maybe the flints in your pistols are worn out ?
1	it was not so at all !
1	korostelev stood by the door of the study , twisting his left mustache with his right hand
1	ah , do sit down , please !
1	and i swear that here , too , there was something as if similar : i had been humiliated , searched , declared a thief , destroyed—well , then know , all of you , that you have guessed right , i am not only a thief , i am an informer as well !
1	they say that was the marked characteristic of gogol , among the writers
1	a moment later the count was admitted
1	let 's have your idea , aramis !
1	to regret the world is to regret the devil
1	mikhail fyodorovich should have gone abroad long ago , but he keeps postponing his departure each week
1	as for grimaud , he was ordered to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload the weapons
1	that fat-bellied rogue got the whole estate
1	so much the better for me , monsieur , if you speak to me , as you say , with frankness ; for then you do me the honor of valuing this similarity of taste
1	strangely , one of the things i liked in his little letter ( one small page of small format ) was that he did not say a word about the university , did not ask me to alter my decision , did not reproach me for not wanting to study , in short , did not produce any parental folderol of that sort , as usually happens , and yet that was precisely bad on his part , in the sense that it testified still more to his negligence about me
1	do you want to betray him ?
1	only i remember that , during our scuffle in the rue férou , i received a sword stroke which , after two weeks or so , produced exactly the same effect
1	how is it that they do not both see all that , or is it that they do not want to see ?
1	tatyana pavlovna turned utterly ferocious
1	they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for
1	pierre took it and began to read :
1	zverkov sprawled on the couch , placing one foot on a little round table
1	not at all , cried zametov , obviously embarrassed
1	something else tormented him , something like remorse
1	he examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious— something seemed to have gone to your head
1	dounia seemed strangely impressed by svidrigaïlov 's offer
1	but , to his surprise , balashov received that day , through duroc , an invitation to the emperor 's table
1	well , let them come and sit down ; there on the sofa is fine , and on the other sofa
1	this man had once been led to a scaffold , along with others , and a sentence of death by firing squad was read out to him , for a political crime
1	thought andrei yefimych , shyly wrapping himself in the robe , and feeling that his new costume made him look like a prisoner
1	i understood at once , as soon as she came in , that she was bound to throw herself upon me ; i was even slightly convinced that she had , in fact , come for that , and therefore i suddenly became extraordinarily casual ; and it did not cost me anything , because , after what had just taken place , i still went on being in joy and radiance
1	why did i ask so stupidly what he greases his boots with !
1	where is he , and who is he now ?
1	the sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue , which is so rare in the neva
1	then she ventured to ask what had become of felton
1	because he 's young , because he 's poor , because he 's a relation because you do not love him yourself
1	why do not you wash , it 's not clean , said prince andrei
1	fly to aid your brother , whoever he may be , instruct him who errs , raise up the fallen , and never nurse any malice or enmity against your brother
1	i should like to know what
1	if you don ’ t know how to look here , you won ’ t learn abroad
1	thought raskolnikov , standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross‐roads , and he looked about him , as though expecting from someone a decisive word
1	princess marya was not in moscow and out of danger , as prince andrei thought
1	pierre listened to what the colonel said and nodded approvingly
1	a fine clerk he is !
1	his intentions were unmistakable
1	pierre says that everybody 's suffering , tormented , becoming depraved , and that our duty is to help our neighbors
1	a penetrating study of the metapsychology of tabooing and the meanings of the unsaid in dostoevsky
1	but he learned it only later ; at the present moment he was not very observant
1	what do you mean ?
1	one 's ashamed to speak of it
1	ach , we are so different , he cried again , we are not alike
1	doctor , come and have a bite to eat !
1	even fierce wolf cubs will not tear their own mother !
1	ah , that 's terrible , terrible !
1	what is this war ?
1	his own family was small ; he had been a widower for twenty years and had only one daughter , the general 's widow , who was now expected any day from moscow , a young person whose character he unquestionably feared
1	he appeared by now to be extremely weak , but as he became more and more drunk , he became more and more talkative
1	and i suddenly felt that i did not have strength enough to struggle out of this whirl , though i had been able to restrain myself , keep silent , and not question nastasya egorovna after her wondrous stories !
1	lizaveta prokofyevna suddenly became frightened of something
1	here 's what i think
1	oh , yes , razumihin answered quickly
1	in that case , supposing he was at liberty , he would rejoin her in france , at the convent of the carmelites in béthune
1	another time he stopped , asked :
1	no , some other time
1	the grandmother , or granny , as she was known at home , very stout , homely , with thick eyebrows and a little mustache , spoke loudly , and from her voice and manner of speaking it was clear that she was the head of the household
1	three and a half miles , your majesty
1	it goes without saying that , for the rest of my life , my gratitude will know no bounds this meant she was now offering me a reward—money , maybe
1	it may be so with a simple peasant , but with one of our sort , an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side , it 's a dead certainty
1	fascination , and at the same time perplexity , showed on the faces of all the listening girls as well ; to everyone it seemed as if impossible and shameful to sing like that , and at the same time all these little faces and eyes burned and shone as if waiting for something more
1	why do not you catch him then ?
1	but she is not very clever either , eh ?
1	the old man was followed by nina alexandrovna , kolya , and , last of all , ippolit
1	he said that the peasants were obdurate , that at the present moment it was not sensible to antagonorize them , with no military detachment around , that it would be better to send for a detachment first
1	the worst thing , he thought , will be if they don ’ t receive me and think something bad about me , or perhaps receive me and start laughing in my face … ah , never mind !
1	the girl listened for some time , walking faster and faster , her head lowered and her face covered by a veil , afraid and trembling , but suddenly she stopped , threw back the veil from her very pretty , as far as i remember , but thin face , and with flashing eyes cried to us : ah , what scoundrels you are !
1	i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear
1	a flash of terrible joy , quick as thought , sprang up in milady 's eyes
1	i see that you , too , are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity
1	he shook my hand warmly , but did not kiss me
1	well , that completely alters the aspect of affairs
1	xxvii : the wife of athos the present caused him no grief ; he shrugged his shoulders when anyone spoke to him of the future ; his secret was therefore in the past , as had been vaguely mentioned to d'artagnan
1	he said that , as he was the cause of the delay , he must bear all the burden of it
1	i never touch vodka , for it 's against my convictions
1	approaching tarutino , kutuzov noticed some cavalrymen , who were taking their horses to water across the road on which his caleche was driving
1	well , here i woke up
1	but do sit down , for mercy 's sake , sit down !
1	you did not see , you were crying all the time
1	let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now , because we have thrown up everything , and have come here relying on you , and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands
1	she really keeps him under her heel , but once it comes to arguments , she has no words of her own , she just speaks his words , nikolai added , yielding to that irresistible impulse that makes us judge the nearest and dearest people
1	it was your fault , sonia , with your advice to make it shorter , and now you see the child is quite deformed by it
1	maybe you have not seen it , but i have seen good people brought up in this tradition of unlimited power , as they become more irritated over the years , become cruel , coarse , know it , ca not help themselves , and become more and more unhappy
1	but who is he ? —but how can it be permitted ?
1	could not arrive at anything constructive
1	said the young man
1	sonya also bustled about constantly ; but the goal of her bustling was the opposite of natasha 's
1	ah , they are the french !
1	she had made her first practical step with extreme resoluteness by marrying mr ptitsyn ; but in marrying him she did not say to herself : if i ’ m to be mean , i ’ ll be mean , so long as i reach my goal—something gavrila ardalionovich would not have failed to say on such an occasion ( and even almost did say in her presence , when approving of her decision as an older brother )
1	the preparations are the bad part
1	i have the pleasure and blessed consolation of finding you in good health , he said to the grandmother , and it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious
1	when the sovereign had ridden by almost all the regiments , the troops began a ceremonial march past him , and rostov , on bedouin , newly purchased from denisov , rode at the tail end of his squadron—that is , alone and in full view of the sovereign
1	a man who , ten years before , would have been afraid of going every day to a house where there was a seventeen-year-old girl , so as not to compromise her and bind himself , now boldly came to her every day and treated her not as a prospective bride , but as an acquaintance who had no sex
1	yes , he is there
1	it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way , though not much so
1	first of all , i gave you fifty
1	it makes no difference to me , i am ready for everything
1	by the'way , i have two letters here in my portfolio : one needs to be delivered and explained personally , the other is to the bank— and there , too and here he charged me with two supposedly urgent errands , which supposedly called for extraordinary effort and attention
1	never mind that it 's red inside , pulkheria ivanovna , afanasy ivanovich would say , accepting a none-too-small slice , sometimes it 's no good even when it 's red
1	i love an honest , pure life , sin is vile to me , i myself do not know what i am doing
1	and she threw herself onto the sofa again
1	the tall , ancient iconostasis showed a profound decrepitude ; its openwork , covered in gold , now gleamed only in sparks
1	are you authorized by her majesty to confide it to me ?
1	i knew nothing about it either !
1	like a clerk , he wore no beard , nor moustache , but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush
1	and he handed it back to d'artagnan , yet without ceasing to look at it
1	gavrila ardalionovich was , they say , dumbfounded by the suggestion and so much at a loss , showed such extreme perplexity on his face , that aglaya laughed at him as if in hysterics and ran away from him upstairs to nina alexandrovna , where her parents found her
1	whatever may befall , said d'artagnan , placing his hand on his heart and bowing , i shall be eternally grateful to your eminence for what he has done for me at this moment
1	seeing that there was no more hope of making his master give up his plan , planchet heaved a deep sigh and set about currying the third horse
1	you spoke of formality just now , apropos of the inquiry , you know
1	but the cossack seized hold of a branch and only the horse fell to the bottom
1	you are putting in a lot for oats , grandpa , said matvei sawich
1	repeated sonia , weeping hysterically and wringing her hands
1	she went and stood before her mirror , and looked at herself
1	you want to come , too ?
1	i ordered books , too
1	i told them you were coming it began with the socialist doctrine
1	all of mankind 's sciences have followed this path
1	read them her mother said pensively , asking about the verses that prince andrei had written in natasha 's album
1	and if mr luzhin had been of unalloyed gold , or one huge diamond , she would never have consented to become his legal concubine
1	not that way , said rogozhin
1	this melancholy , which did not keep her from making merry , also did not keep the young people who visited her from passing the time pleasantly
1	it might be worse not to obey him , said zossimov on the stairs
1	i ca not stand that insolent loudmouth
1	excuse me [ ] dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too late—translator
1	you are not looking in the right place it 's in the fourth gospel , she whispered sternly , without looking at him
1	said mme bonacieux , again addressing this epithet to her husband
1	her fate is enacted in a different realm
1	princess marya noticed it and looked at rostov gratefully , with that luminous gaze which made one forget the plainness of her face
1	now , i have heard that they humor you , fools that you are – they allow you to have lovers here
1	near the tavern the road became a dusty track , the dust of which was always black
1	while rostov was making these considerations and sorrowfully riding away from the sovereign , captain von toll happened to arrive in the same place and , seeing the sovereign , rode straight up to him , offered him his services , and helped him to cross the ditch on foot
1	what is he saying ?
1	there are insults , avdotya romanovna , which no goodwill can make us forget
1	because i love you !
1	d'you hear , she will gallop !
1	early in the morning of the twelfth , he came out of the tent , pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niémen , and watched through a field glass the streams of his troops flowing out of the wilkowiski forest and pouring over the three bridges thrown across the niémen
1	my father listened to the story all the while with undivided attention , and finally said : and the portrait is now with your nephew ?
1	in the corridor he met his roommate nesvitsky and the joker zherkov ; they were laughing at something , as usual
1	simply up and came
1	not true , alphonsinka 's a spy , lambert 's a spy !
1	and leave it to me
1	if it was not you talking , i might take it in an offensive way
1	for whom had they made all these preparations then ?
1	let 's go to maman
1	this business is turning my brain !
1	but before he got all the way down , dense crowds of russian soldiers appeared before him , who , falling , stumbling , and shouting , ran merrily and stormily up to the battery
1	and the whole reason is that they do not know whether god exists or not
1	( this was impolite both towards prince vassily in anna pav-lovna 's drawing room and towards anna pavlovna , who had received the news with as much joy ; but he could not help himself )
1	i feel sad beforehand !
1	what then : did he love that woman or hate her ?
1	ivan ivanovich has big , expressive eyes of a tobacco color and a mouth somewhat resembling the letter v ; ivan nikiforovich has small , yellowish eyes that disappear completely between his bushy eyebrows and plump cheeks , and a nose that looks like a ripe plum
1	i should live so long , brother !
1	but what would rothschild be then ?
1	have you noticed that the most refined blood-shedders have almost all been the most civilized gentlemen , to whom the various attilas and stenka razins [ ] sometimes could not hold a candle ?
1	and the other one 's not here !
1	there 's only one saint here , and that 's mama , but she , too you will frighten him !
1	i wanted to wait , but now in fact she made as if to rise
1	the real murderer dropped those ear‐rings
1	she cried as she said good-bye to uncle , sonya recalled
1	to‐morrow all this nonsense will be over to‐day he certainly did drive him away
1	the countess , with a coldness such as her son had never seen , replied to him that he was of age , that prince andrei was going to marry without his father 's consent , and that he could do the same , but that she would never recognize this intriguer as her daughter
1	no , he 's a freemason , i found out
1	the prince thought with a smile
1	the prince stood thinking
1	one could not , in fact , suffer from memories constantly ; one could rest and enjoy oneself—in the intermissions
1	they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for
1	oh , monsieur , said the old man , do not ask me anything !
1	i got it ready some time ago a powder
1	indeed , what was i afraid of , and what could they do to me with no matter what dialectics ?
1	i had long since recognized the voice
1	a pity , a pity for the fine fellow ; give me the letter
1	but the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel , wetted it and began washing the blood off marmeladov 's face
1	that ’ s good , for certain considerations
1	natasha , you are sixteen years old
1	when she needed to exercise her vocal organs—this happened mainly between six and seven , after a digestive rest in a dark room—then the pretext was the telling of ever the same stories to ever the same listeners
1	a sleepy serf girl would go and rummage in the cupboards , and afanasy ivanovich would eat a little plateful , after which he usually said : there , that feels better
1	and he looked around to see if his opinion was shared
1	he seemed to see abysses of a dark and unknown depth in milady 's soul
1	everybody was looking , and i felt an extraordinary pleasure precisely because i was preaching while the note was in my pocket
1	i told you : a gossip and a little brat , said ganya
1	are you sure he was at home yesterday ?
1	she said , still hoping it was a joke
1	warming up , katerina ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in t—— , on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding‐school , one a most respectable old frenchman , one mangot , who had taught katerina ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in t—— , and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms
1	the dear image of the poor child flashed sadly before him
1	during the first period of his acquaintance with speransky , prince andrei had a passionate feeling of admiration for him , resembling what he used to feel for bonaparte
1	you do not go about things lightly
1	keller agreed with feeling
1	the tartar looked at the sky
1	you think that this enthusiast waving his arms is telling how his wife threw a little ball out the window at a completely unknown officer ?
1	vereshchagin is a traitor and a turncoat , who will get the punishment he deserves , said rastopchin , with that hot anger with which people speak remembering an offense
1	you are just little ; we are both little , but he 's big
1	a man must be blind not to see it !
1	the prince , whom she herself had told that she sometimes went to vasin for advice , had taken this news with extreme uneasiness from the very first ; he had begun to be jealous
1	i would take the hundred pistoles
1	[ ] he visited the orphanage , and , having allowed the orphans he had saved to kiss his helping hands , conversed graciously with tutolmin
1	raskolnikov turned and walked away
1	she knew it , and asked herself : and what then ?
1	my tongue is my enemy
1	it seems you haven ’ t come to a cow-barn , gentlemen , my mother and sister are here …
1	but , i say , i have been told berg is going up in a great balloon next sunday from the yusupov garden and will take up passengers at a fee
1	he understood that hidden—latente , as they say in physics— warmth of patriotism which was in all the people he had seen , and which explained for him why all those people were calmly and as if light-mindedly preparing for death
1	every day i meant to talk with mashenka , only i did not know how to approach her so as to avoid any female screaming
1	the river is overflowing , he thought
1	and why do you call yourself a scoundrel ?
1	now i do not feel guilty before him for anything , not for anything !
1	if not , then as soon as it 's all over , prince vassily sighed , letting it be understood what he meant by the words all over , and the count 's papers are opened , the will and the letter will be sent to the sovereign , and his request will most likely be granted
1	he said , wiping his mouth
1	it 's forbidden in the streets
1	xxviii : the return have some of this ham , d'artagnan , it 's exquisite , said athos , cutting a slice , which he put on the young man 's plate
1	with everyone else things went smoothly , with them unevenly ; everyone else rolled along the rails—they constantly went off the rails
1	she went on , modestly covering her beautiful eyes with her hand , oh , never , never could i !
1	in my view , he said , turning to rostov , he ought simply to beg the sovereign for mercy
1	yes , yes , better , she repeated with conviction , when you go to meet your suffering , then put it on
1	willarski was married to a rich russian woman who had large estates in orel province , and he occupied a temporary position in that town in the provision sector
1	in her cozy room , with icon lamps before the icons , a young boy with a long nose and long hair and in a monk 's cassock was sitting on the sofa beside her at the samovar
1	but , gentlemen , in all this , said d'artagnan , we are not thinking of the queen
1	princess marya was gently stroking her head
1	but allow me to explain raskolnikov put in again , still addressing nikodim fomitch , but trying his best to address ilya petrovitch also , though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him
1	this circumstance speeded the course of things
1	true , he started assuring me later that he had forgotten , and , when he grasped it , he instantly started taking out the fifty roubles , but he became hurried and even turned red
1	the difference between learned europeans and the chinese , who have no science themselves , is quite negligible and purely external
1	if i had been fifteen , i would have turned coward , but , being ten , i feared nothing and pushed my way through the crowd up to the very porch of the palace , just as napoleon was dismounting from his horse
1	and so , even among our nannies , the rank of general was considered the limit of russian happiness and , therefore , was the most popular national ideal of beautiful , peaceful felicity
1	what do people generally say ?
1	a napoleon creep under an old woman 's bed !
1	he began to seek solitude and avoid people
1	that 's why i drink too
1	nastasya egorovna could also find out a thing or two here : she pokes around everywhere
1	the grand inquisitor nevertheless left me in wrath and threatened me with some punishment
1	so you have sold yourself body and soul to the devil for the sake of money !
1	my brother languished in the office
1	it ’ s as if you …
1	what , do you want me to give you a convoy of two battalions that do not exist ?
1	pierre still considered it just as useful and worthy to kill the villain ; but he felt that now he would not do it
1	and who is coming ?
1	moreover , she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself
1	the way you came running into the drawing room just now , everyone was ashamed of you
1	i am airing them out now ; fine fabric , excellent , just turn it inside out and you can wear it again
1	yes , arkady makarovich , you are a member of an accidental family , as opposed to our still-recent hereditary types , who had a childhood and youth so different from yours
1	he surely has not taken it with him
1	bah , the palais de cristal !
1	the mason cleared his throat hoarsely , as old people do , and called for his servant
1	he walked towards the neva along v—— prospect , but on the way another idea struck him
1	he was sitting in the carriage pale as can be
1	and yet she was three months short of sixteen then
1	all of it—the city , the passersby , the sidewalk i was running along—all of it was suddenly not mine anymore
1	the doctor was thus unable to measure either its direction or its depth ; he could only tell from the patient 's pulse that the case was not serious
1	not anywhere , but on this sofa !
1	well , you could even send kolya ; he ’ d be very pleased to do some spying , rest assured—for you , that is … because everything ’ s relative … ha , ha !
1	she sits here from year 's end to year 's end , the old hag ; her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk !
1	will you hurry up , finally ?
1	is it possible to speak with you about anything serious ?
1	go , little miss , i ’ ll talk more with you , but we ’ ve overstayed here
1	prince vassily fell silent , and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side , now on the other , giving his face an unpleasant expression which never appeared on prince vassily 's face when he was in a drawing room
1	bringing the sword to his throat , he said to the englishman : i could kill you , monsieur , for you are certainly in my hands , but i grant you your life out of love for your sister
1	this was a certain evgeny pavlovich r , still a young man , about twenty-eight , an imperial aide-de-camp , strikingly handsome , of a noble family , a witty , brilliant new man , exceedingly educated , and—somehow much too fabulously wealthy
1	at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes , thread , cotton handkerchiefs , etc
1	that will work out perfectly , for it will not look as though you are making a step towards the queen
1	but in the end he began somehow visibly to lose his indifference , and his attitude towards the prince changed to one not only of condemnation , but also of scornful irony
1	ivan fyodorovich shponka and his aunt this is a chicken , my dear sir , the fat grigory grigorievich went on , cutting it up in the wooden box with a knife
1	if he 's all right , serve him
1	people spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves , boys and girls and old people
1	have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this ?
1	he was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa , trying to collect his thoughts
1	what a nice young man !
1	but as they approached yaroslavl , when there again emerged what she might face , and not after many days , but that same evening , princess marya 's agitation reached the utmost limits
1	and she listens to me with tenderness , with pride , with bated breath
1	how do you like what the prince said ?
1	in the corner a light was burning before a small ikon
1	we russians , generally speaking , have never had any stupid , translunary german , and more especially french , romantics , who are not affected by anything ; let the earth crumble under them , let the whole of france perish on the barricades – they are what they are , they wo not change even for the sake of decency , and they will go on singing their translunary songs till their dying day , so to speak , because they are fools
1	not a single thought occurred to him
1	what was the object of it ?
1	almost all madame lippevechsel 's lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat ; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway , but afterwards they overflowed into the room
1	you can always get money from her
1	and you are going alone ?
1	if he reports that the losses were great—it is not true ; maybe around four thousand , not more , and not even that
1	you could see it for yourself ; and how could i ?
1	cried porthos , doing his best to rid himself of d'artagnan , who was scrambling about on his back , you must be mad to go throwing yourself at people like that !
1	she 's gone out of her mind , said another
1	that was what it meant to lose the habit !
1	the duke bowed and left
1	porthos , aramis , call for help !
1	we must start , dounia , we must start , her mother cried in a flutter
1	despite his nervousness and the sharpness of his judgments , he was liked in town and , behind his back , was affectionately called vanya
1	he had not known , he had had no notion of pain , and therefore was not to blame , but his conscience , as rough and intractable as
1	they , too , had got up to go home , but were lingering in conversation with a friend , who had just come up to them
1	would you perchance deny him the title , madame ?
1	you look pale still
1	i don ’ t remember nikolai lvovich
1	speech about useless objects enters consciousness as a thing , as a ponderable mass , as a fact of language valuable in itself
1	nastasya stood over him
1	i , of course , just sit there smoking
1	i don ’ t want any dinner , kolya
1	i just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there
1	he praised his eminence highly to her , told her that he would unfailingly have entered the cardinal 's guards instead of the king 's guards , if he had known m de cavois , for example , instead of m de tréville
1	from my youth i have been chafed by jealousy , dissatisfaction with myself , lack of faith in what i am doing , i am always poor , i am a vagabond , but you , you are a healthy , normal person , a landowner , a squire—why do you live so uninterestingly , why do you take so little from life ?
1	the prince was about to address the voice from the sofa , but the young girl began to speak and , with a most candid look on her pretty face , said :
1	the prince caught her on his hook , first of all , because he never tried to catch her and , second , because in everybody ’ s eyes he ’ s an idiot
1	people say all kinds of things , rogozhin observed drily
1	it 's always like that , nesvitsky said , waving his hand
1	i turned my whole body convulsively , and suddenly , amidst the deep silence , clearly heard the words : lord jesus christ , our god , have mercy on us
1	dounia wants to arrange it all like this and i quite agree with her
1	dounia 's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in raskolnikov 's room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life
1	all the wars of napoleon serve as a confirmation of this rule
1	l'empereur pierre repeated , and his face suddenly acquired a sad and embarrassed expression
1	i was joking , he said softly , smiling
1	general armfelt has suggested a beautiful position , with an exposed rear
1	kutuzov 's face was growing more and more preoccupied and sad
1	but perhaps it was raskolnikov 's fancy , for it all lasted but a moment
1	come sit down , you are tired , i will be bound
1	sounds of music were already coming from behind the closed doors
1	there must be a way from the courtyard ; but how to get in there !
1	really , since yesterday all i ’ ve wanted to do is speak russian
1	no doubt i was at fault , and though , owing to the distance in time and to changes in my character , i ’ ve long regarded my deed as someone else ’ s , i nevertheless continue to regret it
1	anyhow , never mind ; particularly if one is economical … do you intend to enter the service ?
1	among the scattered belongings , in the crowd on the square , she , in her costly satin-covered winter coat and bright purple shawl , which covered her head , resembled a tender hothouse flower thrown out on the snow
1	a woman saw him and said : 'this man was also with jesus , meaning that he , too , should be taken and questioned
1	it could not exist , because it was senseless , and to achieve it was impossible
1	today , he began to whisper , the landlord suddenly brought me photographs , vile photographs of women , all naked women in various oriental guises , and began showing them to me through a glass you see , i praised them reluctantly , but that 's just how they brought vile women to that unfortunate man , to make it easier to get him drunk you keep on about von sohn , but enough , prince !
1	what is awaiting you there ?
1	and seizing dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it , he made her bend down to see that he is all right again
1	she was a woman of forty , not at all bad‐looking , fat and buxom , with black eyes and eyebrows , good‐natured from fatness and laziness , and absurdly bashful
1	april of that same year saw the triumph of his comedy the inspector general
1	oh , you are a just man !
1	the only one left alive to her was the oldest boy , and she doted on him , trembled over him
1	but it ca not be that she loves him !
1	petya silently paced the room
1	at one o'clock , then , behind the luxembourg
1	he was suddenly struck too by the thought that sonia meant to go with him
1	about evgeny pavlovich , ganya again expatiated on his own , without being specially asked , which was very strange , because he inserted him into the conversation with no real pretext
1	it is discussed twice in the novel , the second time at length and in a key passage
1	and kitty , who had never let go of d'artagnan 's hand , led him to a dark and winding stairway and , after going up fifteen steps , opened a door
1	at last he noticed that it was beginning to get light
1	my only excuse is that i am not writing for the same reason everyone else writes , that is , for the sake of the reader 's praises
1	he was in a magic kingdom in which everything was possible
1	who the devil can tell ?
1	and he tried to draw him away , but he tore himself away from his hand , and , beside himself with horror , ran to the horse
1	velchaninov had only just caught in the street that very state councillor and necessary gentleman whom he was now trying to catch by coming upon him by chance at his country house , because this official , barely acquainted with velchaninov , but needed for his case , refused to be caught , then as now , and was hiding as well as he could , not wishing for his part to meet with velchaninov ; rejoicing that he had finally run into him , velchaninov walked beside him , hurrying , peeking into his eyes , and trying as well as he could to guide the gray-haired old fox toward a certain theme , toward a certain conversation in which he might divulge and let drop one much-sought and long-awaited little phrase ; but the
1	how free and fresh the air !
1	she refused to believe her ears
1	sofya semyonovna and i have had a job to find them
1	ganya listened very attentively , but , to his sister ’ s surprise , this striking news did not seem to make any striking effect on him
1	and pyotr petrovitch , as though comforted , went back to clicking his beads
1	well , it 's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom
1	one of the first bullets killed him , the bullets that followed killed many of his soldiers
1	besides ordinary interests , pierre heard talk of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the sovereign entered , when to give the ball for the sovereign , whether it should be done by districts or by the whole province and so on ; but as soon as things touched on the war and what the nobility had assembled for , the talk became indecisive and indefinite
1	take me to her !
1	finally , he could not stand it and at exactly one in the afternoon he himself went galloping to the pokrov
1	the rest of the generals understood that , and , leaving aside the question of moscow , spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat
1	and who was it you wouldn ’ t let see me ?
1	she used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard‐room , to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her
1	upon my word , luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably , crimson with confusion , to distort my words in this way !
1	i remember it being here for all of fifteen years , yes … fifteen … ivan petrovich began
1	i will sit and silently wait for what comes
1	i recalled it clearly the other day , and it has since stayed with me like a nagging musical tune that refuses to be gotten rid of
1	do not hurl yourself against such a rock : he will smash you like a glass
1	he did not know and did not think where he was going , he had one thought only : that all this must be ended to‐day , once for all , immediately ; that he would not return home without it , because he would not go on living like that
1	on the way there , he thought , if even the major does not split from laughing when he sees me , then it 's a sure sign that whatever 's there is sitting where it should
1	there was lack of precaution on both sides , however , for porfiry petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor 's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it
1	but it 's no use going over that !
1	keep on , planchet , keep on !
1	at that point he was found by a friend who came into the room , himself also a painter , a happy fellow , always pleased with himself , not carried away by any far-reaching desires , who worked happily at whatever came along and was even happier to get down to dining and carousing
1	the packet contained a letter with an enclosed three hundred roubles and the necessary certificates concerning liza
1	he was weeping just now and asking to be taken home
1	all these events were an extreme joy for those inevitable frequenters of social gatherings who delight in making the ladies laugh and whose stock was by then completely exhausted
1	the englishman , his lips thrust out , watched from the side
1	but to him who does not fear it , everything belongs
1	he walked , looking about him angrily and distractedly
1	a proper head‐covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way
1	the same thing all over again , said pierre , glancing around
1	are you afraid of having let out some secret ?
1	i told him everything that had been smoldering in me all that time ; i said he was nothing but a pathetic giftlessness and ordinariness , and that there had never been the least sign of an idea in him
1	the windows on the old lady ’ s side were open as before , rogozhin ’ s were closed , and the drawn white blinds seemed to have become still more noticeable in the twilight
1	i will begin by saying that for me there 's no doubt that he loved mama , and if he abandoned her and unmarried her when he went away , it was , of course , because he had become too bored or something of the sort , which , however , happens with everyone in the world , but which is always hard to explain
1	please go inside , have some rest
1	in short , it 's all been known from prehistoric times
1	but you have only to assume that i , too , am a man et nihil humanum in a word , that i am capable of being attracted and falling in love ( which does not depend on our will ) , then everything can be explained in the most natural manner
1	madame , the young man said , bowing , i am unable to refuse someone who asks me in that way
1	for the ancients , these questions were decided by faith in the direct participation of a divinity in the affairs of mankind
1	he was not thinking of treason , he was trying to do everything in the best possible way , he thought it all over : but that is why he 's unfit
1	why , then , did not you have yourself transported to paris ?
1	oh , what an unbearable child !
1	i understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage , but it 's simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated
1	and if he had done all of it together—caught the fish , and played the fiddle , and towed the barges , and slaughtered the geese—what capital it would have produced !
1	he had apparently met it sometime somewhere
1	and that thought , which occurred to her for the first time , filled her soul with joy
1	was it boring for you ?
1	that 's why they so dislike the living process of life ; they do not want a living soul !
1	no more of your jokes !
1	i have taken you on a charming stroll ; here we have a most succulent lunch
1	in any case , the prince had sooner or later to be introduced into society , of which he had not the slightest idea
1	the soldier shouted out , rolling his eyes at rostov and obviously taking him for a hospital superior
1	the thing was that afanasy ivanovich was about fifty at that time , and he was in the highest degree a respectable and settled man
1	no , i ca not ; it 's more than i can bear
1	but the poor fellow is saved by the criminal 's temperament , worse luck for him !
1	can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name ?
1	it pains me to look at her , and to comfort her at least a little i let her say whatever she likes , and even say nothing when she judges people unfairly or chides me for not having a practice or publishing textbooks
1	this russian landowner—let ’ s call him p—in the former golden age the owner of four thousand bonded souls ( bonded souls !
1	the icon split exactly into two pieces
1	this just meant : let me alone , this is sickening
1	polenka , have you got everything ?
1	till then , at least , he was free and must do something for himself , for the danger was imminent
1	he gave just enough money for the wedding and invited all his relations and acquaintances
1	i have allowed myself to speak out , because you addressed me earlier as a mediator between yourself and pavel pavlovich
1	and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary , feverish , as it were distracted haste
1	and when we were by ourselves , you understand ?
1	i will say that i know this grand lady
1	they could not have refused me so easily !
1	i believe it 's reality , he thought
1	lxiv : the man in the red cloak he and athos exchanged a few words in low voices , then the tall man made a sign that the musketeer could come in
1	once he went into the mountains on a clear , sunny day , and wandered about for a long time with a tormenting thought that refused to take shape
1	i could go into greater detail , but it 's not worth it , for it 's all extraneous now ; all i want to do is finish telling the main thing
1	for no reason , but the sunrise , the bay of naples , the sea—you look at them and it makes you sad
1	if kraft burned it then ?
1	shouted rostov , coming up to the crowd with quick strides
1	precisely , alexander semyonovich picked up , bustling around the patient
1	you do not know what you are saying yourself
1	and she began to languish , brother
1	i have to use different models all the time
1	quite so , but what drove him , or rather perhaps disposed him , to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of mr svidrigaïlov
1	what have i to do with this ?
1	she stopped in front of him
1	there , what is that blockhead laughing at ?
1	yes , he has come in
1	where we have orders to bring you
1	no , i myself lied to her about kraft , i deceived her , because it was also impossible to avoid it , and i lied involuntarily , innocently
1	and what ? —the news did not make the slightest impression on him ; he did not even raise his eyebrows !
1	nikolenka turned to look at pierre ; but there was no longer any pierre
1	it is hard to describe how animated and encouraged the prince became that evening
1	i ’ m not thanking you , i simply … admire you , i ’ m happy looking at you ; perhaps i ’ m speaking foolishly , but i—i need to speak , i need to explain … even if only out of respect for myself
1	count ostermann-tolstoy met the returning hussars , sent for rostov , thanked him , and said that he would report his daring action to the sovereign and request the st george cross for him
1	well , i will give you new hats
1	laughter creates the distance that allows for recognition , without which the book might be a tract , a case history , a cry of despair , anything you like , but not a work of art
1	your excellency , i assumed
1	the old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge , but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor
1	two more minutes , my dear ivan fyodorovich , if you permit , lizaveta prokofyevna turned to her husband with dignity , it seems to me that he ’ s all feverish and simply raving ; i ’ m convinced by his eyes ; he can not be left like this
1	marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement
1	well , what does he know , your alexander semyonych ?
1	he did not want to meet anyone till then
1	that she 's not of the nobility , believe me , has never embarrassed me for a moment , he said to me
1	on the contrary , to console him she promised to find an occasion for conveying the future child to him , assured him that from then on they would have other responsibilities , that their friendship was now sealed forever— in short , there was not much logic , but the goal was the same : that he should deliver her from his love
1	queen of heaven , saints above
1	and these types in any case are still a current matter , and therefore can not be artistically finished
1	m de tréville was in his reception room with his usual court of gentlemen
1	she concluded all but wrathfully , parting from evgeny pavlovich
1	remain free , then , and keep your hatreds and your sympathies
1	it 's the third day he has not eaten
1	however , he certainly knew how to do it , vasin added
1	the officer of the horse guards mounted up and rode to yet another
1	i remember zverev , when he had finished work , giving the sofa a loving flick and saying to me : vous dormirez comme un petit roi
1	i am a contemptible person , dounia
1	yes , he used to get his hair pulled pretty often , roared the commissariat clerk again , swallowing another glass of vodka
1	there are three hundred pistoles in this pouch
1	for if you once knew the truth and saw it , then you know that it is the truth and there is and can be no other , whether you are asleep or alive
1	kutuzov was chewing roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with narrowed , merry eyes
1	if you need the pistol of an honest man , prince , i ’ m ready to exchange a half-dozen noble shots , even before you get up the next morning from your honey bed
1	he had to mount to the third storey
1	all these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness
1	let 's decamp first , interrupted d'artagnan , you will understand later
1	he asked , barely able to control the trembling of his lower jaw
1	no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything
1	do not torture me , he begged her miserably
1	she had noticed even earlier that his face now lacked something , as if , since he cut his hair , his face had also changed
1	but i did hear something from praskovya pavlovna herself , though she is by no means a gossip
1	i believe only one of your rooms is taken
1	they rode at a walk towards a barn , by which a large crowd of muzhiks was standing
1	awakens him to a truth he had not suspected or had not understood before
1	phew phew phew , he whistled barely audibly , riding into the courtyard
1	they talk of duty , conscience—i do not want to say anything against duty and conscience ; —but the point is , what do we mean by them
1	who will shelter the poor child ?
1	i must be unwell
1	evgeny pavlovich , in a rather incoherent letter from paris , told of her that , after a brief and extraordinary attachment to some émigré , a polish count , she had suddenly married him , against the will of her parents , who , if they did finally give their consent , did so only because the affair threatened to turn into an extraordinary scandal
1	two sons , one of whom already served in the chancellery , and a comely sixteen-year-old daughter with a slightly upturned but pretty little nose , came every day to kiss his hand , saying , bonjour , papa
1	the trim figure of the fair-haired soldier with clear blue eyes stepped from the line
1	there were no letters or papers in my room , and previously i had almost never locked my door when i left
1	i feel that , besides me , above me , spirits live , and that in this world there is truth
1	burned me right through
1	an island , he read , is a piece of dry land surrounded on all sides by water
1	said stepan nikiforovich , seeing his guests off
1	and if he hasn ’ t , he will
1	i do not know how much time passed—an hour , or a few days , or many days
1	a nice set , these authors !
1	yes , and so you need suitable activities
1	why should such a fantasy enter the head of a child , sir , who ought to be playing with toys ?
1	and you know she fancies it 's very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is !
1	he was a man of principle and in good standing with his excellency ; it would be nothing for him , as anya was told , to take a note from his excellency to the principal of the school and even to the superintendent , to keep pyotr leontyich from being dismissed
1	listen , he added , turning to her a minute later
1	having laid marmeladov down , raskolnikov flew to katerina ivanovna
1	if anything happens , i have one request to make of you , he added , dropping his voice
1	it suddenly appeared that katerina ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of which marmeladov had spoken to raskolnikov in the tavern , when he told him that katerina ivanovna , his wife , had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school
1	you are my only hope , said petya
1	the house with the mezzanine : an artist 's
1	in the spacious better side of the muzhik andrei savostyanov 's cottage , a council gathered at two o'clock
1	he may very well be in love , because he ’ s a boy !
1	all i hear is insults and offense
1	here he again lost his breath and began to cough
1	yes , do you object ?
1	well , he will do better next time !
1	the third time , which is this one , you may succumb
1	razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table
1	in an abstract love for mankind , one almost always loves oneself
1	behind the groom came a wagon , and behind the wagon an old house serf in a peaked cap , a short coat , and with bandy legs
1	exclaimed lizaveta prokofyevna , letting go of his arm and watching almost with horror as he wiped the blood from his lips
1	for a moment , as he straightened the overcoat , pierre opened his eyes and saw the same sheds , posts , courtyard , but it was all bluish now , bright , and covered with sparkles of dew or frost
1	but there 's no need , it 's all right
1	there happened to be a girl in the house then , parasha , a black-eyed wench , whom i had never seen before—she had just come from another village—very pretty , but incredibly stupid : she burst into tears , wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal
1	in my opinion , then , we must travel together
1	it 's out of spite
1	the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver
1	mikhail ivanych got up and went to the study
1	and , of course … and i … and that ’ s prince-like !
1	please , petrovich , akaky akakievich said in a pleading voice , not hearing and not trying to hear all petrovich 's words and effects , fix it somehow , so that it can serve a while longer at least
1	it was becoming very sultry …
1	we will break down the door , and if he 's in too much of a rage , well , then we will kill him
1	later you will find out what
1	he smiled again , but there was something very unkind in his smile
1	i had already been sitting for an hour and more , and was sitting by the window on one of the two wicker chairs that stood by the window
1	come , come , tréville , be quiet , said the king
1	i suddenly got up from my chair
1	better speak , you ’ ll regret not saying everything
1	they have scarcely the faintest notion of russia , and that does not trouble them at all
1	several officers came together , with soldiers surrounding them
1	wherever i might go , whatever happened to me , you would remain to look after them
1	he brooded with relish , in profound secret , over the image of a girl—virtuous , poor ( she must be poor ) , very young , very pretty , of good birth and education , very timid , one who had suffered much , and was completely humbled before him , one who would all her life look on him as her saviour , worship him , admire him and only him
1	said my enemy in a mocking tone , 'then that is something else
1	asked ilagin , approaching the hunter who had spotted the hare and turning , not without excitement , to whistle up yerza
1	she had met him in staro-kievsky street when she was a schoolgirl and no longer remembered his last name—appeared as if from out of the ground and invited her for the waltz , and she flew away from her husband , and it seemed to her as if she were sailing in a boat through a heavy storm , and her husband had stayed far behind on the shore
1	the account is noted down in my pocket‐book
1	if no food , how live ?
1	now you and you alone are left me as a true friend , sir !
1	the air was so sweet and fragrant , the sky such a deep blue and all spangled with stars !
1	but we shall meet again
1	and you will catch hell ?
1	so now he prays to god in russian
1	n‐no , sonia whispered naïvely and timidly
1	thank god we finished before you came !
1	four weeks had gone by since pierre was taken prisoner
1	now , in the year , it was noticeable for a man living close to the people that these undercurrents were intensely at work and were close to manifesting themselves
1	raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa , but could not close his eyes
1	nadya had heard it all last year and , it seemed , the year before last , and she knew that sasha could not think differently , and it used to make her laugh , but now for some reason she felt annoyed
1	you are here , and i went to your place looking for you , he said to me
1	here he took off his belt , laid his sword down so that it would not clank , and , seizing the branches , climbed up the tree
1	for they read and talk all their lives , filled with bookish sweetness , but they themselves dwell in perplexity and can not resolve anything
1	yes , yes , razumihin agreed , i noticed that , too
1	he became aware of someone standing on the right side of him ; he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head , with a long , yellow , wasted face and red sunken eyes
1	i do not want the money
1	that 's what it means to know how to make acquaintances , thought berg , that 's what it means to know how to behave !
1	the tea stood untouched
1	the passerby who had lost it was already some forty steps ahead of me and soon dropped from sight in the crowd
1	farewell , afanasy ivanovich , merci !
1	what i ca not understand , he said , is that the emperor alexander made all these personal enemies of mine his intimates
1	during the last year he struggled like a fish on dry land , but his life had come full term
1	he scorned the new symbolist movement in literature , but the surface objectivity of his work gives way time and again to a visionary symbolism of his own ( of which the black monk is the most obvious , and least successful , example )
1	said d'artagnan , squeezing her hand more strongly
1	the judge crossed himself
1	she had heard from amalia ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question : how could she let her daughter sit down beside that young person ?
1	on the night of the first of september , kutuzov 's order was given for the retreat of the russian troops through moscow to the ryazan road
1	listen , i will tell it to you now
1	they did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other
1	maybe you will eat something , pulkheria ivanovna ?
1	the roof was constructed in such a way that one could stand up in the middle , and one could even sit up on the beds if one moved closer to the table
1	but where will you put me in the meantime ?
1	yes he was so kind dounia , i promised luzhin i would throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell rodya , what are you saying !
1	i told him quite humbly , for i did not conceal from myself the bad position i had put myself in by laying the three musketeers hands on one of his majesty 's musketeers , i told him that i was ready to submit to his conditions
1	ah , that 's true , i remember !
1	then you do not know me , monsieur ?
1	why does my reason fully admit all this ?
1	in moscow mikhail averyanych donned a military jacket without epaulettes and trousers with red piping
1	why is she grieving too ?
1	yes , i see myself now that i am almost well , said raskolnikov , giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made pulcheria alexandrovna radiant at once
1	he was finally released and set completely free
1	he raised his head higher , his eyes lit up with a gleam of life , and he followed the maid with quick steps , overtook her , and came out on povarskaya
1	follow this corridor , a little stairway will take you to it
1	she touched his mustache
1	as soon as they parted , each thought of nothing else
1	and what about him ?
1	he only needed to insult her , to insult her senselessly , not even knowing what for , snatching at a pretext , and i gave him a pretext
1	i lived in dreams even before that , lived ever since childhood in a dreamlike realm of a certain hue ; but with the appearance of this main idea that swallowed up everything in me , my dreams consolidated and all at once molded themselves into a certain form ; from stupid they became reasonable
1	at last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor , he suddenly started , and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him
1	the society may not be secret , if the government allows it
1	who wants to make a bet with me ?
1	my general is just seething , sir ; but i suspect he ’ ll slip away from me in petersburg in order to visit the captain ’ s widow
1	his majesty will certainly wish to see you , but not today
1	and have you , puff , puff , had her long , your excellency ?
1	rostov remembered swienciany because , on the first day they entered this little town , he had dismissed his sergeant major and had been unable to handle all the drunken men of the squadron , who , without his knowledge , had got hold of five barrels of old beer
1	ptitsyn sometimes urged ganya—in a friendly way , naturally—to find a job
1	oh , my god , who knows ?
1	the meeting was over , and on his return home it seemed to pierre that he had come back from some distant journey , where he had spent dozens of years , had changed completely , and had detached himself from the former order and habits of his life
1	my agrafena trofimovna likes them very much
1	it 's past nine , i have brought you some tea ; will you have a cup ?
1	a translation of dostoievski , du double a i'unité ( plon , paris , ) , especially interesting for its analysis of the erotic/mimetic aspects of dostoevsky 's work
1	farewell , do not remember any evil of me !
1	twelve years before , ferapontov , with a bit of a hand from alpatych , had bought a woods from the prince , went into commerce , and now owned a house , an inn , and a flour shop in the provincial capital
1	you heard me say to the prince : it will be as you say
1	oh , oui , answered natasha
1	blood flowed from the horse 's head
1	but , he said , lowering his pike , where indeed is that letter ?
1	he always listened with a pleasant smile to the guests who came to see him , and sometimes spoke himself , but mainly to ask questions
1	i know myself , kitty , and that one is hooked
1	he got up from his chair and took his hat
1	she would write and post letters for them to their relations
1	well , then , monsieur , let us go to him ; let us make him swear by the name of god , before whom he is perhaps about to be summoned , to tell the truth
1	what did i rave about ?
1	to a blackguard , a blackguard , who shouldn ’ t have been paid !
1	the blindfold suddenly fell from his eyes
1	and after that this disgraceful creature goes asking their forgiveness !
1	he was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it
1	these questions are for later , but now i am only talking about the possibility of achieving the goal
1	he had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything
1	you are so skinny to look at , yet i can barely feel your ribs
1	now she was no more than thirty-nine years old , but her dark blond hair was already strongly streaked with gray
1	five times already , with other people , prince andrei had heard exactly the same phrase about the countess zubov and the same laughter from his wife
1	you ought to get acquainted , your excellency
1	he belonged to a mixed society , though naturally of a trumpish sort
1	katerina ivanovna took it and gave him a polite , even ceremonious , bow
1	semyon ivanych hastily took his leave
1	twice they noticed that the french had appeared below , close to them , and then they fired on them with canister shot
1	in the wards , the corridors , and the hospital yard , it was hard to breathe for the stench
1	what a terrible life !
1	for at that time , as writers write and maintain , universal famines visited mankind once every two or three years at least , so that in such a state of affairs man even resorted to anthropophagy , though he kept it a secret
1	no , it seems the sale will go through one of these days , someone said
1	write : i don ’ t negotiate
1	natasha could guess that they were talking about the old prince , working something out , and that disturbed and offended her
1	the sun was there , our new sun was there , that was all i kept saying !
1	davout took the envelope and read what was written on it
1	and here you have considered how and what , but a watchman 's the same as a peasant , he 's got no understanding , he just grabs you by the scruff of the neck and drags you off
1	lebedev , extraordinarily pleased , went on clowning , snatching the books from his daughter
1	and what have you heard ?
1	nevertheless , many times during that evening she had despaired of fate and of herself ; she did not invoke god , as we know , but she had faith in the genius of evil , that immense sovereignty that reigns over all the details of human life , and for which , as in the arabian fable , a pomegranate seed is enough to reconstruct a destroyed world
1	first of all , he ’ s already planning to live in my house ; that ’ s all right , sir , but he ’ s enthusiastic , wants straight off to be like family
1	ah , my dear , what do i care if she kills me !
1	nothing at all no one 's services no one 's sympathy
1	but the night passed without any new attempt from my persecutor
1	frank has also shown that the attack is not limited to part one : two of the three main episodes in the second part of notes — the episode of the bumped officer and the episode with the prostitute liza – are in fact parodic developments of episodes from chernyshevsky 's novel
1	the feast feasted : swords swing , bullets fly , horses whinny and stamp
1	i see some trap has been set here , and i do not understand anything , she said , but if you really have that letter here it is , you can see for yourself !
1	his head was spinning ; the whole room whirled around
1	she got tired over the winter , that 's what
1	these young men are contemptible on that point
1	i waxed pathetic , so much so that i myself was about to have a spasm in my throat , when
1	have they finally come to moscow ?
1	it 's as if i was glad to take advantage of his being alone and dejected
1	but natasha was not asleep , and her fixed , wide-open eyes looked straight ahead from her pale face
1	he got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home
1	he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow , then another on the skull
1	finally adelaida observed that there was no need to run like that during a stroll and that there was no keeping up with mother
1	you are mistaken , my dear sir
1	lowering his legs and spreading both hands against the sides of the window , he tried his position , settled himself , let go with his hands , shifted a little to the right , to the left , and took the bottle
1	to fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home , do not you see
1	i will teach you to go ahead back !
1	what did he say ?
1	to understand the degree of exhaustion of the russian army , one need only understand clearly the meaning of the fact that , having lost no more than five thousand wounded and killed since tarutino , and no more than a hundred as prisoners , the russian army , which had numbered a hundred thousand when it left tarutino , numbered fifty thousand when it reached krasnoe
1	he entered the square not without some inadvertent fear , as if his heart had a foreboding of something bad
1	this circumstance was one of the causes of the then heavy mood in the epanchin family , though mrs epanchin said at the time that she would gladly cross herself with both hands
1	here i will not and can not describe anything in detail
1	then another error came over me , seeing you in the company of these gentlemen : i thought you might be gravely ill the two men in black , who understood his intentions , shot d'artagnan an almost threatening look ; but d'artagnan was not troubled by it
1	razumihin caught him up
1	he stood still a minute , grinned and went back to the police office
1	why does not he go on his way ?
1	the letters were full of expressions such as anisim never used in conversation : my gentle mama and papa , i am sending you a pound of chamomile tea for the satisfaction of your physical needs
1	suddenly ippolit jumped quickly from his chair , as if torn from his place
1	but she rode on me , on me myself !
1	i will if you tell me to , only you ’ d better judge for yourself : is it at all possible for me to go now ?
1	as the sun set , the wind died down
1	they have just been dancing , but once they have gathered around the table
1	in print we need everything noble ; we need ideals , but this
1	he shook all over with wrath , jumped up , and , his face red and angry , his eyes popping , rushed to the middle of the room
1	they will fill their glasses and , with a shout , drink my health
1	no , i haven ’ t heard anything from lebedev—if it ’ s lebedev you ’ re speaking of …
1	the two men in black rose , bowed to aramis and d'artagnan , and moved towards the door
1	zossimov made a slight movement , and would have answered , had not razumihin anticipated him
1	but xvi : in which the keeper of the seals séguier searches more than once for the bell in order to ring it the way he used to but what ?
1	a foolish thought , sir , i feel it myself now , an unnecessary one , sir
1	prince andrei was obviously not interested in these abstract conversations
1	a retired clerk of the commissariat department came , too ; he was drunk , had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy—was without a waistcoat !
1	for all this undoubtedly comes to her from d'artagnan
1	is bazin coming with us ?
1	the countess 's health still did not improve ; but it was no longer possible to put off the trip to moscow
1	his hair in front , at the temples , had obviously been hastily slicked down with a brush , but in back it stuck up naively in little tufts
1	so , then , at nine o'clock be ready here at the hôtel ; i will come to fetch you
1	i want to settle here for good , he told her
1	the other day , when he came out of church in full regalia , mikhail sido-rych semyon did not finish , hearing in the still air the clear music of no more than two or three hounds baying in pursuit
1	he felt joyful and happy
1	[ ] prince vassily said to anna pavlovna
1	and suddenly out of the weeds came her gray cat , thin , scrawny ; it was clear that she had had nothing in her mouth for several days
1	some historians say that the cause was the conquering spirit of the french , the patriotism of russia
1	perhaps it suddenly seemed terribly strange and incredible to her that she was now sitting with that woman , in that woman ’ s house , and was in need of her reply
1	he would go to bed at around three and get up at eight
1	all from lack of self-control and from having grown up in a corner
1	prince andrei , who usually spoke easily and well , had difficulty expressing himself now in talking with speransky
1	again he stopped in indecision
1	a room to teniers ' taste , you see—disorder , disorder , a table with a bust on it , an arm , a palette
1	i agree : man is predominantly a creating animal , doomed to strive consciously towards a goal and to occupy himself with the art of engineering – that is , to eternally and ceaselessly make a road for himself that at least goes somewhere or other
1	no , ma ’ am , they ’ re not really nihilists , lebedev , who was also all but trembling with excitement , stepped forward
1	true , one was run over by horses in the street
1	his elder son fyodor works as a senior mechanic in a factory and , as the peasants say of him , has risen so high in the world that nobody can touch him
1	at your mamma 's request , through afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin , of whom i presume you have heard more than once , a remittance is sent to you from our office , the man began , addressing raskolnikov
1	they haven ’ t changed , never , not in anything … but … i go that way now , good-bye !
1	but at the same moment , his two listeners , the three musketeers accompanied by the host , fell upon dartagnan with great blows of sticks , shovels , and tongs
1	natasha glanced at hélène and at her father , as if asking them what on earth it meant , but hélène was taken up by a conversation with some general and did not respond to her glance , and her father 's glance said nothing to her except what it always said : you are enjoying yourself , and i am glad
1	lebedev turned around and , seeing the prince , stood for a time as if thunderstruck , then rushed to him with an obsequious smile , but froze again on the way , nevertheless having uttered :
1	on the one hand , reasoning shows that the expression of the will of man in words is only part of the general activity expressed in an event such as a war or a revolution ; and therefore , without recognizing an incomprehensible supernatural force—a miracle—it is impossible to allow that words could be the immediate cause of the movement of millions ; on the other hand , even if we allow that words can be the cause or an event , history shows that the expression of the will of historical figures in the majority of cases produces no effect at all , that is , that their orders often are not only not carried out , but that sometimes what takes place is even the opposite of what they ordered
1	nevertheless , this news , conveyed in the form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov and received during the night , just as he was falling asleep , astonished and vexed the count
1	yes , yes , to war , he said , no !
1	flashed as it were by chance through raskolnikov 's mind , and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room , trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement
1	why , rodya , this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and dounia and i were just planning to pawn her watch , so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help
1	so , then , tomorrow we go ?
1	but he was already standing by his hotel … how he had disliked this hotel earlier—the corridors , the whole building , his room—disliked them at first sight ; several times that day he had remembered with a sort of special revulsion that he would have to go back there … how is it that , like an ailing woman , i believe in every foreboding today !
1	by the porch of the house occupied by bilibin stood a britzka half filled with things , and franz , bilibin 's servant , dragging a trunk with difficulty , came out the door
1	that is , it 's somebody else walking , but i walk behind on purpose and think : is not it her , there now , i think , is not that my olya ?
1	listen , he added , turning to her a minute later
1	i confess , i was astounded by this outburst
1	naturally , i will run to anna andreevna 's ; i said purposely , out of vexation , that i would not go ; i will run right now
1	prince andrei sighed and said nothing
1	il n ' a pas l'air d'un homme du peuple , [ ] said the interpreter , looking pierre over
1	the prince thought a little , went back up , and showed him the cross without taking it from his neck
1	bonacieux cried out in despair
1	the higher authorities and police took charge of distributing the goods left by the french
1	he paces his rooms and tries to make sense of what has happened , to collect his thoughts to a point
1	marie came through ryazan , said natasha
1	if i do not come to‐morrow , you will hear of it all , and then remember these words
1	the sovereign went to the study
1	here 's what : he knew that the wealthy cossack choub had been invited for kutya by the deacon , and that there would also be the headman , a relative of the deacon 's in a blue frock coat who sang in the bishop 's choir and could hit the lowest bass notes , the cossack sverbyguz , and others ; that besides kutya there would be spiced vodka , saffron vodka , and lots of other things to eat
1	he trembled , remembering that
1	he tarred his boots , carried three quills behind his ear and a glass vial tied to a button with string instead of an inkpot ; he ate nine pies at one go and stuffed the tenth into his pocket , and he could write so much of every sort of calumny on one sheet of stamped paper that no reader could read through it at one go without interspersing it with coughs and sneezes
1	the head clerk took the paper , and turned to attend to others
1	and what , he said , you think his voice died out in a sob
1	and writing it is a thorny problem
1	it was the first time in his life he had shot a gun , but he had been wanting to buy a gun for a long time , still at touchard 's , and we had long dreamed of a gun
1	it was proposed to make a flanking march to the left , to cut off the viceroy and capture him
1	thankless work and lacking in beautiful forms
1	such a decision is , of course , one of the more advantageous for your friend , baron bjoring , and , i confess , you have not surprised me in the least : i was expecting that
1	what does he abuse , prince ?
1	according to d s mirsky ) among the intelligentsia , but not among the peasants from whom chekhov came
1	i will add , however , that i did poorly in the last year , whereas up to the seventh grade i had always been one of the first , and it happened owing to the same idea , owing to a conclusion , maybe a false one , that i drew from it
1	if i refuse the honor of being attached to you , believe me
1	he met katerina nikolaevna suddenly , precisely when he was expecting mama , at the most impatient moment of expectation
1	examining it well at home , he discovered that in two or three places—namely , on the back and shoulders—it had become just like burlap ; the broadcloth was so worn out that it was threadbare , and the lining had fallen to pieces
1	however , before she lay down , a better idea occurred to her
1	put him straight on the sofa , with his head this way , raskolnikov showed him
1	at this amalia ivanovna , lashed to fury , struck the table with her fist , and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna , and not ludwigovna , that her vater was named johann and that he was a burgomeister , and that katerina ivanovna 's vater was quite never a burgomeister
1	les prussiens sont nos fidèles alliés , qui ne nous ont trompés que trois fois depuis trois ans
1	and all this was accomplished by one glance , by one turn of a pretty head
1	you exhaust all my patience , nastasya filippovna said sharply and vexedly
1	you have been misunderstanding me , i think , rodion romanovitch , he added after a brief pause , that 's why you are so surprised
1	he will know what it means
1	six or more pale , bandaged , and dirty wounded went jolting down the rocky road in each of the long german vorspanns
1	first of all , it had been made by a man totally drunk to a man who was half so , and yet , despite the vagueness that rises to the brain from the vapors of two or three bottles of burgundy , d'artagnan , on waking up the next morning , had athos 's every word as present to his mind as if they had been imprinted there just as they had fallen from his mouth
1	it might be at an inconvenient moment , he‐he !
1	when they drank to the sovereign 's health , pierre , being deep in thought , did not rise or take his glass
1	it was also hard to believe that she would just rash to the unknown lambert at the first summons ; but again , it might happen for whatever reason , for instance , seeing the copy and being convinced that they indeed had her letter , and then—the same trouble !
1	above all , he considered bjoring 's gratitude a much surer thing than the fantastic plan of the inept but hot-tempered lambert and a versilov nearly insane with passion
1	he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something
1	allow me to give you one piece of advice
1	because , rogozhin suddenly began to go on , as if he had not interrupted his speech , because if it ’ s your illness , and a fit , and shouting now , somebody may hear it in the street or the courtyard , and they ’ ll figure that people are spending the night in the apartment ; they ’ ll start knocking , they ’ ll come in … because they all think i ’ m not home
1	yet he did ask forgiveness , and even sobbed loudly , but nobody paid attention to it , thinking he was drunk
1	alpatych went to them , trying to bring them to reason , but they answered him ( karp did most of the talking ; dron did not appear in the crowd ) that it was impossible to let the princess go , that there was an order about it ; but let the princess stay , and they would serve her as before and obey her in everything
1	he sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his hands
1	i forgive you pass !
1	the jury went and locked themselves in for the decision , then suddenly they all come out : no , not guilty
1	a woman , that is , a lady—i am speaking of ladies—comes stomping straight at you , without even noticing you , as if it were your unfailing duty to jump aside and yield her the way
1	a vague instinct told pierre that all these reservations and repeated requests to tell the whole truth expressed princess marya 's ill-will towards her future sister-in-law , that she wished pierre to disapprove of prince andrei 's choice ; but pierre said what he felt rather than what he thought
1	we will see our guests off , then we will have a rest
1	to live in order to exist ?
1	it 's my brother setting out again
1	no one can offend you
1	he had kissed her foot and said
1	the document is in my hand
1	he went and brought back the strange reply that anna andreevna and prince nikolai ivanovich were impatiently awaiting me in their rooms—meaning that anna andreevna did not wish to come
1	not only that , i am convinced that you are in favor of tax-farming
1	i should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built
1	her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever , and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home
1	looking at them in society , it seems there 's something there , but there 's nothing , nothing , nothing !
1	having received this news late in the evening , when he was alone in his study , the old prince did not say anything to anyone
1	but do you know that perhaps i might have done ?
1	we wanted to take him abroad for the summer , but tatyana pavlovna insisted that we not take him , and he did not want it himself
1	mainly by knowing how to choose my acquaintances
1	however , since the wound might , after all , be serious , despite his suspicions , he sent a man on horseback that same moment to fetch a doctor
1	a slight cloud passed over bonacieux 's brow , but so slight that d'artagnan did not perceive it
1	that it ’ s as if i keep teaching …
1	or taking us to moscow ?
1	just then a commissariat soldier , a hospital attendant , came out of the next room and , stamping his feet , snapped to attention in front of rostov
1	athos , this woman is the cardinal 's spy , i am sure of it !
1	at that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her
1	and again his eyes acquired their former dry and cold expression
1	there was a sharp feeling of freshness in the air
1	then what is your decision , rodya ?
1	he asked him in a whisper
1	she sat in his box office , looked after things in the garden , recorded the expenses , handed out the pay , and her pink cheeks and sweet , naive , radiant-looking smile flashed now in the box-office window , now backstage , now in the buffet
1	and you go on without a mate , like a cock at the market
1	the story tells about the emergence of a mr golyadkin jr in the government office where the petty clerk golyadkin serves , a parody and rival of himself who eventually drives him mad
1	he narrowed his eyes , showing that he was listening
1	lxii : two sorts of demons truly , they will go so far that we will be obliged to send them to the bastille
1	you did a beautiful thing , said the prince
1	they dghrag the ghregiment here and there all day
1	do go to bed , all of you , she added with vexation
1	will you take it ?
1	forbid him , andrei petrovich , suppress him , and throw him out , tatyana pavlovna snapped
1	my only illness is that in twenty years i have found only one intelligent man in the whole town , and he 's mad
1	my memory has weakened , my thoughts lack consistency , and each time i set them down on paper it seems to me that i have lost the intuition of their organic connection , the constructions are monotonous , the phrasing impoverished and timid
1	he was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him
1	it was even hard for him to believe that this was the same haughty girl sitting before him who had once so proudly and arrogantly read gavrila ardalionovich ’ s letter to him
1	all this time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room , anxious not to interrupt the conversation ; when sonia had gone he walked up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand
1	natasha had been in this state of stupor since morning , when sonya , to the countess 's astonishment and vexation , had found it necessary , no one knew why , to tell natasha about prince andrei 's wound and his presence with them in the train
1	i will tell you what to do , and what i do
1	and in an hour zossimov himself will report to you about everything
1	i will find out , though
1	perhaps he really is ill , she said , turned and went out
1	then it was heard that peasants called as witnesses had been sent from the village ; the old hired workman also received a summons , and he left
1	i just need to win back a certain figure , and then tell me , with this three hundred , i owe you about two thousand five hundred , is that right ?
1	she listened without any special surprise , as if to the most usual words
1	liza cried out for the whole house to hear , and it was then that they came running—all that about a minute before my arrival
1	astonishment , inform her of such details as i did not even suspect were still preserved in my memory
1	maybe you think i ’ m incapable of dying the way glebov did ?
1	they sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws , but far from noticing what was the matter , he drew them all the closer to him
1	and as it is in french , people will see at once that you are children of good family , and that will be much more touching you might sing amarlborough s'en va‐t‐en guerre , for that 's quite a child 's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses
1	well , so all the moscow ladies are losing their minds !
1	well , since you have decided , added pulcheria alexandrovna , so be it
1	is it olga ivanovna you want ?
1	oksana seemed perfectly pleased and happy ; she chatted , now with this girl , now with that , and laughed all the while
1	the prince looked him up and down intently
1	his majesty is doubtless referring to god , said m de tréville , for i know of no one but god who could be so far above his majesty
1	russian women lose their looks quickly , their beauty is fleeting , and in truth that 's not only owing to the ethnographic properties of the type , but also to the fact that they are capable of loving unreservedly
1	not long ago i was amused by a certain supposition : what if i should suddenly take it into my head now to kill whomever i like , even a dozen people at once , or to do something most terrible , that is simply considered the most terrible thing in the world , what a quandary the court would find itself in before me , with my two- or three-week term and with torture and the rack abolished !
1	sonia , sonia take his money !
1	all this was done in an instant as he passed , and trying not to betray his interest , he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something
1	where could he escape to , he‐he ?
1	and what if it so happens that on occasion man 's profit not only may but precisely must consist in sometimes wishing what is bad for himself , and not what is profitable ?
1	no , i continued to serve her
1	i used to teach her to walk , i would put her in the corner three steps away and call her , and she comes swaying to me across the room , and she 's not afraid , she laughs , and when she reaches me , she throws her arms around my neck and embraces me
1	ferdyshchenko left , you say ?
1	and now let this woman know , in her turn , that i am not carrying out my profession , but my duty
1	milord , milord , you call things for your defense that accuse you still more
1	it was clear that the words do not be jealous for some reason struck him terribly
1	he took money and various things he told all this , word for word , to sofya semyonovna , the only person who knows his secret
1	i did not finish it , but there 's a passage where i could not help crying , said nina ivanovna , and she sipped from the glass
1	it was just light enough for her to recognize those who were coming
1	he drank his glass almost in one gulp and poured more ; in general he began to behave with a hitherto unusual casualness
1	and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face , though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment , for the axe was raised over her face
1	that means it 's all nonsense and vanity , and in essence there 's no difference between the best clinic in vienna and my hospital
1	the frightened and insulted feeling in her face first gave way to rueful amazement
1	he suddenly pressed his hands together before me
1	why , a stupid thing like this , the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan
1	so you are the fiancé ?
1	and again their peaceful , happy life flowed on without sorrows or alarms
1	my ensuing leisure and my old age would have been devoted , in company of the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son , to visiting gradually and as a real country couple , with our own horses , every nook and cranny of the empire , receiving complaints , redressing wrongs , and scattering monuments and benefactions all over and everywhere
1	that he is far from being , or rather from having been , as guilty towards you as he seems
1	if he had long been planning to kill me , he would have made sure to prepare a knife or a pistol beforehand , and not have counted on my razors , which he had never seen until yesterday evening—came to his head , among other things
1	linden-blossom infusions , rubbed him with eau de cologne , and wrapped him in her soft shawls
1	it remains an image of false unity , but is denounced in rather different terms : the underground man puts his tongue out at it , calls it a tenement house and a chicken coop
1	when he finished the first part , dostoevsky still thought that the prince could go on to redeem nastasya filippovna and even to regenerate the dark rogozhin
1	he pulled it off , but reflecting that he had no other socks , he picked it up and put it on again—and again he laughed
1	just then it also happened that my sister 's husband in moscow squandered our small fortune , including my share of it—a tiny share , but i was left penniless in the street
1	about two months before , they had met in the street , but raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed
1	marvelous is the working of our world , i thought as i walked down nevsky prospect two days ago , calling to mind these two events
1	in the middle of a figure , he called out to rostov , who was just passing by
1	you will accept his judgment ?
1	work slowly , said the curate , we leave you in excellent intentions
1	he wanted to destroy all , all of it
1	natasha , he 's no more , no more !
1	on the contrary , in questioning you , he showed great curiosity and concern for the circumstances of your own life , its successes and failures , which always interest all kindly old men , though it somewhat resembled the curiosity of a child who , while talking to you , studies your watch fob
1	dolokhov was a man of medium height , curly-haired and with light blue eyes
1	this is a madhouse !
1	the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments
1	my voice faltered and would not obey me
1	have a drink , a bite to eat , then hit the sack
1	i mean it ’ s … how shall i tell you ?
1	in this way the estate turns by itself into what is merely a gathering of the best people , in the literal and true sense , and not in the former sense of a privileged caste
1	tell me directly , frankly tell me : you are not drunk today ?
1	if anyone had come into his room then , he would have jumped up at once and screamed
1	but ivan ivanovich began talking about hunting quail , which usually happened when he wanted to change the subject
1	how can they convict him , even if they arrest him ?
1	sacré dieu , c'était beau
1	he has a tongue
1	i am speaking the truth
1	there ’ s nothing better than the poor knight ’ !
1	and porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before
1	from which may be trustworthily seen the connivance of the said mirgorod regional court and the indisputable sharing of the jewish profits from it by combining mutually
1	karataev was sitting at the edge of the road , by the birch , and two frenchmen were saying something over him
1	again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie—that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything—that he would never again be able to speak of anything to anyone
1	do you understand now ?
1	i will still have time , when i want , to occupy myself with love , but right now i am busy
1	god created man for be alive , for be joy , and be sorrow , and be grief , and you want nothing , it means you not alive , you stone , clay !
1	is it that she was with totsky ?
1	and , first of all , it 's not logic , allow me to inform you of that , because even if he were not , he could still preach the truth and , finally , what is this word 'preaches ' ?
1	i work from morning till night
1	wonderful proportions , there 's no disputing it !
1	and how can you discuss my obedience ?
1	although they were well off , the volchaninovs lived permanently in the country , summer and winter , and lydia was a teacher in a zemstvo school in her own shelkovka and earned twenty-five roubles a month
1	not in the least
1	he was known in the hôtel of the musketeers , and everyone held him to be a good comrade
1	i shall make a struggle for it and they wo not do anything to me
1	this is not like before
1	yes , tell them to bring my horse
1	her much too magnificent finery struck the eye , it would have attracted attention on the train , and only later did the girl understand why her worthless old rag had been bought at such profit for her
1	athos held his hand out towards her
1	but , though he did not see his look , velchaninov understood that he had to support pavel pavlovich
1	but it got so dark in the sky , and under the sky , that it was no longer possible to see what went on further between them
1	prince andrei , going back into the shed , lay down on the rug , but could not sleep
1	perhaps it 's even very beautiful
1	yesterday i happened to be with a learned doctor of theology , whom i consult occasionally to do with my studies athos smiled
1	yes , that 's herder 's teaching , [ ] said prince andrei , but that , dear heart , does not convince me ; life and death are what convince me
1	and this one , why is it all black under his nose ?
1	he is pushed into a meeting of the rulers
1	he never drinks much in the mornings ; if you ’ ve come on business , talk to him now
1	but , after all , is it customary for officers of the english navy to put themselves at the orders of their lady compatriots when they approach a british port , and push their gallantry so far as to see them ashore ?
1	lizaveta prokofyevna covered her with the end of her shawl
1	porfiry petrovitch went out to order tea
1	but your excellency what—nobody knows
1	men met in groups , agreed on something , swore to keep together , but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed
1	the prisoners were a still greater burden to the soldiers of the convoy than the saddles of the cavalry depot or junot 's train
1	i do not want anything more to‐day , you can go
1	something of it always remains
1	renouncing the concept of cause , mathematics seeks laws , that is , properties common to all unknown infinitely small elements
1	we can leave , the son said in french
1	dear grandpa , i ca not stand it , it 's simply killing me
1	perhaps i am right in thinking you want me to ; very well
1	lament for your sickness , and god wo not grant you death , said karataev , and he went back at once to the story he had begun
1	petya stepped out of the front hall , looked around in the darkness , and went over to the wagons
1	but suddenly now , when i heard about kraft , i jumped up from the bed , i was all seized as if by a convulsion
1	so i sat like some sort of dress-circle virtue in a box at the french theater , and fled like a wild thing from all the men who chased after me in these five years , and had the look of proud innocence , all because my foolishness ran away with me !
1	but the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering
1	he wetted the rag and rubbed the boots
1	start again from the beginning , pyotr ippolitovich
1	for the achievement of this goal , we must assure a preponderance of virtue over vice , we must try to make it so that the honest man already attains in this world the eternal reward for his virtues
1	velchaninov was pleased both with the adventure and with its setting
1	mother , whatever happens , whatever you hear about me , whatever you are told about me , will you always love me as you do now ?
1	excuse me , my friend , i say to the visitor , but i can not pass you
1	now there were so many other joys and things to do !
1	in that case , it 's it 's part three but , anyhow , what of it ?
1	believing , perhaps , that there , under a bush , we would embrace each other and weep , in the proximity of innocence
1	so , then , you can also make a sheath , for instance , for a dagger or something else ?
1	and then , one bright morning , at dawn , he suddenly found me freezing under the wall and fell directly onto the trail of the richest , in his opinion , of affairs
1	said porthos , putting a finger to his lips
1	well , that 's perfectly fair !
1	the three musketeers what 's that ?
1	general ivolgin , retired and unfortunate
1	he was sitting in yesterday 's chair , smoking cigarettes , and had just poured himself the fourth and last glass from the bottle
1	no , i have the advantage of your generosity , that 's all
1	everything lit up and glistened
1	she had filled out and broadened , so that it was difficult to recognize in this strong mother the former slender , nimble natasha
1	kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to rodion romanovitch
1	i must tell you that i would heard of this stupid story before you wrote and do not believe a word of it
1	that cured me of beautiful , poetic , and loving women , said athos , straightening up and not thinking of maintaining his fable about the count
1	both ippolit and aglaya epanchin refer them to prince myshkin , but we never actually hear him say them either
1	i bent to his hand and suddenly began kissing it greedily , several times , many times
1	their laughter and talk in mutually incomprehensible languages could be heard
1	instead of looking after your children , you ’ ve been sitting in debtors ’ prison
1	be that as it may , the carefree p raised the orphaned young gentleman in a princely way , hired tutors for him , and governesses ( pretty ones , no doubt ) , whom , incidentally , he brought from paris himself
1	she ’ s a curious one , agreed the prince
1	i sprang after her into the hallway
1	why do you cling to this legality of marriage ?
1	at times he could not believe that it was mme bonacieux , and he hoped to find her at the louvre the next day ; at times he feared she was having an intrigue with someone else , and that the jealous man had caught her and carried her off
1	how could he have left all those things in the hole ?
1	you are not thinking that i will marry you off at once ?
1	all eyes were directed at him
1	at the noise , i raised myself on one hand
1	obviously , the russian nest was devastated and destroyed ; but beyond the destruction of the russian order of life , pierre felt unconsciously that the french had established their own quite different but firm order over this devastated nest
1	let ’ s go , maman , how long must this continue !
1	yes , i have business … the prince began
1	le maréchal se fâche contre l'empereur et nous punit tous ; n'est-ce pas que c'est logique !
1	often an old , re-dyed
1	he guessed that the lady in the black mantilla was the procureuse of the rue aux ours , the more easily as the church of saint-leu was not far from the said street
1	he sat down on the deserted seat
1	give the order , sire , he said , you have the right of pardon
1	why talk about me ?
1	do not worry , gentlemen , i am not saying it so that you will throw yourselves on my neck and we will all start lowing like calves from tenderness !
1	evening was coming on when he reached home , so that he must have been walking about six hours
1	i confess , i would not have gone to the office at all , knowing beforehand what a sour face the section chief would make
1	and altars are set up to him after his death , and so all is permitted
1	two officers of his division joined him
1	this incident made a strong impression on him
1	wait till you are sent for !
1	didn ’ t you look for it together before ?
1	and so the soldiers , after a twenty-mile march , without a wink of sleep , spent the whole night mending and cleaning ; the adjutants and company commanders calculated and counted off ; and by morning the regiment , instead of the straggling , disorderly crowd it had been the day before , during the latest march , was a well-ordered mass of two thousand men , each of whom knew his place , his duty , each of whose buttons and straps was in its place and sparkling clean
1	he was black earth all over
1	so i finally have news of her—she 's alive , she 's safe in a convent , she 's in stenay !
1	he did not say he had been detained by the sovereign
1	you hinted it yourself ; you talked to me of poison i know you went to get it you had it in readiness it was your doing it must have been your doing scoundrel !
1	he said , taking pierre by the elbow ; and in his voice there was sincerity and weakness , such as pierre had never noticed in him before
1	kindly take a cup of tea with me today
1	but now i tried to soften the impression and put the poor prince to bed : you will have a good sleep , and your ideas will brighten up , you will see for yourself !
1	i don ’ t think anybody ’ s going to raise his hand now against someone like me ; even a woman wouldn ’ t hit me now ; even ganechka wouldn ’ t !
1	anatole did not let go of the englishman , and though he had nodded to show he had understood everything , anatole translated dolokhov 's words into english for him
1	suddenly a round , compact puff of smoke was seen , a play of purple , gray , and milky white , and boom ! —a second later came the sound of this smoke
1	cried buckingham , forgetting all except the thought of whom this letter might be from
1	the romans did not survive even fifteen hundred years as a living entity , and they also became material
1	or or there 's something here that i do not know myself , because here , it must be , there 's not just nature
1	what 's more , they suddenly became extraordinarily free
1	only the darkness above seemed to become deeper , and the dark images looked more gloomily from the old carved frames on which gold gleamed here and there
1	well , thanks , if only she 's telling the truth
1	and where have i been then ?
1	tomorrow we are off , i am giving you a place in my carriage
1	the commissary 's brow darkened more
1	but in fact , pavel pavlovich—and i thank him for it—has reminded me of an extremely important matter , which i might have let slip , velchaninov laughed , shaking hands with the host , bowing to the hostess and to the girls , and , as if especially among them , to katerina fedoseevna , which again was noticed by everyone
1	no , it was something else
1	to this mrs epanchin responded that belokonsky had written something of the same sort to her and that this is stupid , very stupid ; but there ’ s no curing a fool—she added sharply , but one could see from her face how glad she was of what this fool had done
1	well , you are the sort of guest who does not need to be entertained , old zakhlebinin cheerily decided at last , getting up from his chair to go to his room upstairs , where , despite the feast day , he had a few business papers ready for going over , and , imagine , i considered you the gloomiest hypochondriac of all our young people
1	i ’ ll visit her myself , maybe today
1	—getting up and backing towards the wall
1	i have studied all this morbid psychology in my practice
1	turning in at the gateway , he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his hand
1	the melody grew , passing from one instrument to another , what is known as a fugue was going on , though petya had not the slightest idea of what a fugue was
1	if i were rothschild , i would go about in an old coat and carry an umbrella
1	i analysed , if i remember , the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime
1	he was evidently badly injured
1	but i still go on remembering … and , so to speak , find repose in the cultivated circle of my former comrades and subordinates , who adore me to this day
1	where are you off to ?
1	you must agree that i could have done so without any permission , i snappedif i waited , it was
1	out of a basement ?
1	the ladies demanded that only their soul and character be portrayed in the main , while the rest sometimes should not even be adhered to , all corners should be rounded , all flaws lightened , or , if possible , avoided altogether
1	he behaves like a cad himself , and just look at him , please
1	many voices shouted and talked all at once , so that ilya andreich had no time to nod to them all ; and the group grew in numbers , broke up , came together again , and moved , with a buzz of voices , to the large hall , to the large table
1	and so on , and so on
1	‖ it ’ s something new
1	even philanthropy did not yield the desired results
1	when nikolai and his wife came looking for pierre , he was in the nursery , holding his awakened nursling son on his enormous right palm , dandling him
1	he was the friend of the king , who , as everyone knows , greatly honored the memory of his father , henri iv
1	during our expedition to béthune , my duchess 's husband died , my dear , so that , with the deceased 's coffer holding its arms out to me , i am marrying the widow
1	there isn ’ t any foolishness , only the deepest respect , aglaya suddenly declared quite unexpectedly in a grave and serious voice , having managed to recover completely and overcome her former embarrassment
1	this expression of concern was pleasing to him , parole d'honneur , sans parler de ce que je vous dois , j'ai de l'amitié pour vous
1	it 's good for something , you see , to have been raised somewhere
1	in the garden , toward the end , velchaninov succeeded completely in becoming close with nadya ; she no longer peered at him scowlingly as earlier and seemed to have set aside the idea of studying him more closely , but laughed , jumped , squealed , and even seized him by the hand once or twice ; she was terribly happy , and went on paying not the slightest attention to pavel pavlovich , as if not noticing him
1	when i speak or read , my mouth twists to one side ; when i smile , my whole face is covered with an old man 's deathly wrinkles
1	i am not complaining
1	he had too much confidence in himself , in his power and in the helplessness of his victims
1	she is tearing up all the clothes , and making them little caps like actors ; she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle , instead of music
1	and nikolai kissed her hand once more
1	no one has ever heard a groan or a word of protest from him
1	when i am standing in court as defender of an accused man , i can not help speaking or knowing what i am going to say
1	the more cunning a man is , the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing
1	and they are very kind and the children , too , often come to see me
1	ah , you know it very well , porthos , said aramis
1	each to his own place
1	but his feeling was stirred ; his heart ached , as he looked at her
1	asked crutch , and he turned around to see how far praskovya was lagging behind
1	at that moment , the clock of the samaritaine struck six
1	i remember only that i woke up in the middle of the deep night and sat up on the bunk
1	but , despite all their attempts to show that the cause of an event lay in intellectual activity , only with great flexibility can one agree that there is something in common between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples , but in no case is it possible to allow that intellectual activity guides the activity of people , for such phenomena as the cruelest murders of the french revolution resulting from the preaching of the equality of man , and the wickedest wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love , do not confirm this supposition
1	god keeps us from that terrible misfortune !
1	just as he was , in his hat , fur coat , and felt boots , he lowered himself onto the bench ; his companion , the coroner , sat down facing him
1	i am unable to understand this strange act on your part
1	and the man told the whole truth
1	listening to bennigsen and the generals discussing the position of the troops at the foot of the hill , pierre fully understood them and shared their opinion ; but , precisely for that reason , he could not understand how the one who had placed them there at the foot of the hill could have made such an obvious and crude mistake
1	he now thought the occasion had come , and turning to his neighbor , said : it 's not surprising that this young man is afraid of a ball , no doubt he 's an apprentice musketeer
1	bronze candlesticks were being sold
1	some woman brought a horse to water , but the horse would not drink
1	the story of how ivan ivanovich quarreled with ivan nikiforovich i am not guilty of any evil designs , said ivan ivanovich , not turning his eyes to ivan nikiforovich
1	he could not remember alone , and looked inquiringly at razumihin
1	austrian column leaders shuttled among the russian troops and served as heralds of the departure
1	you will steal my son
1	i say it , prince , so that there will be no misunderstandings
1	raskolnikov shouted with vexation
1	so there , kiss me
1	how and where he came back he did not remember
1	all i want is for you to be happy and you know that ; i am resigned to fate , but my heart will always be with you , whether we stay together or must part
1	asked sonya , leaning out the window of the carriage
1	the old lady and the girls came out to the porch to see the guests off , and for a long time still they kept bowing to the aunt and nephew peeking out of the britzka
1	at dinner he quickly relaxed , contributed observations on this and that , and ate a rather mature pig almost by himself
1	it seems neither of us is entirely happy , isn ’ t it so ?
1	countess marya wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone , that he ascribed too much importance to this business ; but she knew it was unnecessary and useless to say it
1	the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing
1	the aunt , however , gave a sign to ivan fyodorovich to stay and said something softly to the old lady
1	could i have seriously set down such a stupid epigraph ? … listen , gentlemen ! … i assure you that in the final end this may all be the most terrible trifles !
1	and you have not been here either ?
1	and what if it does not stick ?
1	and you scorn suffering and are surprised at nothing for a very simple reason : vanity of vanities , external and internal scorn of life , of suffering , and of death , comprehension , the true blessing—all that is a most suitable philosophy for a russian lie-about
1	so you are not angry with me ?
1	what the principle of this harmony is , the underground man can not say ; he has never found it
1	yes , and he did well
1	never , never had she felt anything like this
1	shut up , shut up !
1	but , as far as i know , he should not be
1	probably that in the twelfth century only monks could be eaten , because only monks were fat , observed gavrila ardalionovich
1	did m bonacieux give you anything for his wife or for some other person ?
1	on the contrary , i passionately wanted to prove to all that riffraff that i was by no means the coward i made myself out to be
1	all this happened so quickly that the philosopher barely managed to recover his senses and seize both his knees with his hands in an effort to stop his legs ; but , to his great amazement , they kept moving against his will and performed leaps quicker than a circassian racer
1	in the street the heat was insufferable again ; not a drop of rain had fallen all those days
1	but since it was already a great deal for him to have made this child revolt against his master , he bowed respectfully to the king , and with his permission took leave of him
1	i was forced to add that as well
1	concluding that he had returned to his senses , the landlady closed the door and disappeared
1	he seemed more cheerful than usual and awaited his son with great impatience
1	the singers stood by the windows
1	but look at what he writes , said another , pointing to a printed sheet he was holding in his hand
1	and he generalized from the fact that he did nothing , and saw it as a sign of the times
1	i should like to make a proof , so to say , mathematically clear
1	he paced up and down the room for a long time , muttering something to himself , then stopped and said :
1	he understood that these feelings really were her secret treasure , which she had kept perhaps for years , perhaps from childhood , while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief , in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches
1	we will find out , do not worry
1	but he interested me greatly , and i spent that whole day under the influence of strange thoughts , so that i decided to call on him myself the next day , to return the visit
1	he was a placid man , like a hen , of the oldest cast , nurtured on obsequiousness , and yet a kind man and even a noble one
1	in the course of the first four days , during which he was not called for anywhere , prince andrei rode around the entire fortified camp and , with the help of his knowledge and of conversations with well-informed people , tried to form some idea of it for himself
1	napoleon gave a start ; destiny was being decided
1	she was standing sideways to the table
1	i was sitting in an armchair by the table , and he was pacing the room
1	prince andrei saw that this ippolit , of whom he ( it had to be admitted ) had almost been jealous over his wife , was the buffoon of the company
1	be so kind , masters , as to take me with you !
1	instead of the simple dishes i became accustomed to as a student and a doctor , i am now fed pureed soup with some sort of white icicles floating in it , and kidneys in madeira
1	or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say , ill yes , simpler and more comprehen yes , ill quite so
1	dear natalie , said princess marya , please know that i am glad my brother has found happiness she stopped , feeling that she was saying an untruth
1	they are now living in a wonderful country house ; there are many children , they will love you there , they are kind
1	i don ’ t understand why we never go abroad
1	natasha , animated and alarmed , looked around with wide-open , frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual
1	descending to the bridge , petya and dolokhov rode past the sentry , who gloomily paced the bridge without saying a word , and went down into the hollow where the cossacks were waiting
1	all who were accompanying her froze in amazement , the crowd parted before her , and rogozhin suddenly appeared five or six steps from the porch
1	no , she would not ; girls like that ca not stand things !
1	it was as if natasha 's love , persistent , patient , not as an explanation , not as a consolation , but as a summons to life , enveloped the countess on all sides every second
1	about your affair , prince andrei turned to boris again , we will speak later , and he glanced at rostov
1	though i sat in the same place almost the whole time , in the country
1	he had two horses saddled and took it upon himself to escort the young guard
1	it 's in accordance with your theory !
1	why , his teeth are chattering as he asks , he‐he !
1	and he vividly pictured natasha to himself , not as he had pictured her before , with her loveliness alone , which brought him joy ; but for the first time he pictured her soul
1	let 's go home and read it
1	we are going to the nevsky sonia , sonia !
1	( ) power is that relation of a certain person to other persons in which the person takes the less part in the action the more he expresses opinions , suppositions , and justifications for the jointly accomplished action
1	[ ] was that not a deception ?
1	so he went to meet athos without bringing a second , resolved to content himself with those chosen by his adversary
1	it was like the eve of a battle : their hearts throbbed , their eyes laughed ; they felt that life , which they were perhaps about to leave , was , when all is said , a good thing
1	i exclaimed in intoxication , because i was terribly pleased with this whole conversation and the direction it had taken
1	he became hoarse and exhausted from crying long ago , but he goes on howling , and no one knows when he will quiet down
1	glad or not , welcome the guest
1	his intentions were unmistakable
1	he , too , is a cardinal
1	he came in very pleased with himself , so pleased that he did not find it necessary to conceal his state of mind
1	a woman can ’ t speak like that , if she has any self-respect , in the house of her … mama is also very worried about you
1	of course , replied the jesuit
1	well , come to my room ; you wanted to come and see me , did not you ?
1	you will ask for the host , and you will say 'forward ' to him
1	they all came and eagerly gathered around her
1	it was a letter from princess marya
1	cried the young man again
1	he had already shouted his fill , for the most part fruitlessly , and talked to his heart 's content with the rag seller who stood across the street by the door of his own shop , and , remembering at last that he had a customer in his shop , he turned his back to the people and went inside
1	cried kitty , that 's my mistress summoning me !
1	in moving to the tula road , in a desperate push beyond the pakhra , the commanders of the russian army had in mind staying near podolsk , and there was no thought of the tarutino position ; but a countless number of circumstances , and the reappearance of french troops , who had previously lost sight of the russians , and the plans for battle , and , above all , the abundance of provisions in kaluga , made our army deviate still more to the south , and move to the middle of its supply lines , from the tula to the kaluga road , to tarutino
1	she suddenly jumped up , suddenly trembled all over , and—what do you think ? —
1	but i am a fool , too !
1	the room was in semi-darkness , only two icon lamps burned before the icons , and there was a good smell of incense and flowers
1	sonia with a faint cry ran up , embraced him and remained so without moving
1	so she lives with the prince ?
1	how did it happen that way ?
1	in the middle of the cotillion , natasha , having finished a figure , still breathing hard , was going to her seat
1	yes , if it were true ; but i do not believe it , i have no right to and can not believe it
1	also to have lunch ?
1	and no one , no one dares to come and judge me in my own house and consider me a baby !
1	so you are glad , and i have done right ?
1	it was a winding road , and about a hundred paces further on , it turned to the right to the graveyard
1	the chambermaid approached planchet , whom she took for lubin , and held out a little note to him
1	our means were only so much ; we took this room because it was the smallest , and we saw it was an honorable house , and that was the most important thing for us
1	i am sure that she is a good girl , and that it is all nonsense
1	the prince is here , and your husband , and the whole company
1	but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india‐rubber , at least is not alive , has no will , is servile and wo not revolt !
1	one bright morning , around half-past ten , varvara ardalionovna ptitsyn , having gone out to visit some of her acquaintances , returned home in great and rueful pensiveness
1	she looked into her fiance 's face and saw there an expression of compassion and bewilderment
1	m athos had gone to visit one of his friends , who happened to be out , m de tréville went on , a young béarnais , a cadet in his majesty 's guards , m des essarts 's company ; but he had hardly settled himself in his friend 's place and picked up a book while he waited , when a swarm of combined writ servers and soldiers came to lay siege to the house , broke down several doors the cardinal made a sign to the king which meant : this was on that business i mentioned to you
1	why , you are all crying again !
1	mightn ’ t it be that you ’ re acting too light-mindedly , that you ought to look around first ?
1	i feel quite distracted , you know
1	since boris left moscow for the army in , he had not seen the rostovs
1	everything had been well done
1	but these recollections scarcely troubled him now ; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings
1	are you just coming from papa ?
1	one of the players said he had hoped he could be trusted
1	and the conversation again became concentrated , the ladies ' at their end of the table , the men 's at theirs
1	on two sides , the black smoke of fires rose and spread
1	this was the superintendent of the district himself , nikodim fomitch
1	the officer , smiling and shaking his head , as if laughing at himself , ran almost at a trot down the empty street towards the yauzsky bridge to catch up with his regiment
1	you will see for yourselves
1	power , power , that 's what i wanted then , the game was what i wanted , i wanted to achieve your tears , your humiliation , your hysterics – that 's what i wanted then !
1	why did you lie here , then ?
1	and you want to get a fortune all at once ?
1	and he used to be a house serf
1	he doesn ’ t understand anything , prince ; he ’ s totally , totally unable to understand !
1	you will perhaps say to me , contemptuously shaking your headsyou thirst for life , yet you yourself resolve life 's questions with a logical tangle
1	i have a feeling that you and i will either be friends or enemies
1	good evening , dear heart !
1	well , m de la porte placed her near her majesty so that our poor queen would have at least someone to trust , abandoned as she is by the king , spied on as she is by the cardinal , betrayed as she is by everyone
1	i fall in love , being a famous poet and court chamberlain ; i receive countless millions and donate them immediately to mankind , and then and there confess before all the world my disgraces , which , of course , are not mere disgraces , but contain an exceeding amount of the beautiful and lofty , of something manfredian
1	go back to gorki , prince andrei said suddenly
1	i do not know how to answer your question , he said , blushing without knowing why himself
1	alexei ivanovich , alexei iva-novich , do not decide yet , sir !
1	and if ever i regretted the death of my father and mother , it is now , and i sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest i would have aimed at them !
1	it 's good , is not it ?
1	now listen : give this letter to mikhail ilarionovich
1	you are a finicky one , said athos
1	but m de tréville knew nothing , except that the last time he had seen the cardinal , the king , and the queen , the cardinal had had an extremely worried look , the king had been upset , and the reddened eyes of the queen had indicated that she had lain awake or wept
1	yes , it was a prison , for i tried in vain to get out
1	the entire household was governed only by the imaginary orders of the husband , that is , by pierre 's wishes , which natasha tried to guess
1	i am drunk , rodya !
1	why , it 's just such trifles that always ruin everything he had not far to go ; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house : exactly seven hundred and thirty
1	the latter , a pretty girl of twenty or twenty-two , alert and lively , the perfect stage soubrette for a grand lady , jumped down from the footboard , which she had been sitting on following the custom of the time , and headed for the terrace where d'artagnan had seen lubin
1	as for mme coquenard , she could not hold back her tears
1	the rest made some show of ceremony on entering and were all but abashed , though they looked grave and were obviously afraid of somehow losing their dignity , which was strangely out of harmony with their reputation as negators of all useless social trivialities , prejudices , and almost everything in the world except their own interests
1	they got to vereshchagin a half-educated little merchant , you know , a piddler-diddler , the adjutant said , smiling
1	about how all this news affected me , i will tell later , in its place , but now—just a few concluding words about him
1	he sat deeply immersed in a folding armchair , constantly groaning and spreading the collar of his tunic , which , though unbuttoned , still seemed to chafe his neck
1	there 's only one thing i ca not understand : what made him risk such a contemptible action
1	yes , i know , said the soldier
1	there began the struggle for separation , for isolation , for the personal , for mine and yours
1	why have you , who do not believe in the truths of the light and do not see the light , why have you come here , what do you want from us ?
1	the young men repeated in chorus
1	at other times you do not pay any attention to rockets , but now any vain thing makes you glad
1	but most likely it wo not happen though he 's capable tell me , as a friend : you did know about it , you had a presentiment ?
1	he was recently married to varvara , who was taken from a poor family : she is a young woman , beautiful , healthy , and smartly dressed
1	now and then he stopped , listened to the gunfire , and peered at the battlefield
1	it had been raining all morning , and had seemed as if it were just about to stop and the sky to clear , when , after a short pause , the rain would come down harder still
1	in their attitude towards him , doubt could still be felt of who he was ( perhaps a very important person ) , and hostility because of the still-fresh personal struggle with him
1	but chiefly , however you shuffle , it still comes out that i always come out as the first to blame for everything and , what 's most offensive , blamelessly to blame , according to the laws of nature , so to speak
1	and the germans seized pirogov by his arms and legs
1	the wounded , that 's who !
1	hard labor in siberia !
1	no , what i find astonishing is that you were informed of my arrival
1	lambert drawled , laughing and triumphant
1	i will never go to your place , and know also that by tomorrow , or the day after without fail , this paper will be in her own hands , because this document belongs to her , because she wrote it , and i will hand it to her personally , and if you want to know where , know that i will do it through tatyana pavlovna , her acquaintance , in tatyana pavlovna 's apartment—i will hand it to her in tatyana pavlovna 's presence , and take nothing from her for it and now—off with you , forever , or else or else , lambert , i will deal with you less politely when i finished , i was trembling all over
1	he would had enough and left without further ado
1	am i capable of that ?
1	and meanwhile this touching moment refused to be caught
1	his legal father , the peasant makar dolgoruky , he has never seen
1	i wouldn ’ t find anything to say
1	i feel my pulse and , not finding it in my wrist , search for it in my temples , then under my chin , then again in my wrist , and it 's all cold , clammy with sweat
1	i beg you , andryusha , for god 's sake , for the sake of your late father , for the sake of my own peace , be nice to him !
1	it 's trishatov whispering to you against me : i saw the two of you whispering there
1	marfa nikitishna , i believe , wanted to enter a convent ; though i won ’ t insist on that ; maybe i heard it about somebody else … yes , i heard it about a doctor ’ s widow the other day …
1	the memory of the fish he had eaten at dinner was unpleasant
1	but katerina ivanovna is absolutely frantic
1	thought velchaninov , and at once dropped the thought , as if fearing some blasphemy
1	there , sir ; and not only money , sir !
1	no , i simply make bold to state it by way of fact , if i took this man or that for a criminal , why , i ask , should i worry him prematurely , even though i had evidence against him ?
1	yes , of an unbelievable flatness !
1	get out , get out , cursed woman !
1	as soon as vasin praised me , i suddenly felt an irrepressible urge to speak
1	as soon as i go home tonight , i ’ ll lie down at once … in two weeks i ’ ll be dead , i know that … last week b—–n told me himself … so , with your permission , i would like to say a couple of words to you in farewell
1	and when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth
1	he became still more irritable than before , and all the outbursts of his groundless wrath fell mainly upon princess marya
1	the terrible word trembled on his lips , like the latch on that door ; in another moment it will break out , in another moment he will let it go , he will speak out
1	and that 's humiliating for a young man of any pride , in our day especially but remorse ?
1	enough , mother , she seized her
1	olympiada semyonovna shrugged at him and raised her eyes to heaven
1	well , you will see she worries me ; but you will see , you will see !
1	athos , porthos , and aramis , after having a good time at my place and becoming quite lively , made so great a racket that the provost of the castle , a very rigid man , has confined them to barracks for several days
1	god would not allow anything so awful !
1	ca not recall the title
1	to please her , they opened the calendar to another place ; again three names came out : trifily , dula , and varakhasy
1	come , my friends , said athos , let 's finish them off with one blow
1	yes , yes god will repay you for it , faltered sonia , gazing intently at pyotr petrovitch
1	i have drowned , frozen—everything 's happened
1	ah , you are right , monsieur !
1	why , you used to reproach me with breadth !
1	du sublime ( he sees something sublime in himself ) au ridicule il n ' y a qu'un pas , [ ] he says
1	he whispered frenziedly—and suddenly recovered himself
1	he saw with horror the truth of their words : half of his hair had indeed turned white
1	those who left , taking along whatever they could , abandoning houses and half their property , acted that way because of the hidden ( latent ) patriotism which is expressed not in phrases , not in the killing of children to save the fatherland , and similar unnatural acts , but inconspicuously , simply , organically , and therefore always produces the strongest results
1	your things , the ring and the watch , were wrapped up together , and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil , together with the date on which you left them with her how observant you are !
1	if you see so poorly , my dear sir , do not allow yourself to speak of what you do not know
1	the voices of the foot-draggers , who advised waiting for something else and not going on the offensive , had been so unanimously stifled and their arguments refuted by the indubitable proofs of the advantages of an offensive , that what was talked about at the council—the future battle and undoubted victory—seemed no longer future but past
1	i am leaving , and that 's the end of it
1	there was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing
1	i know you will shoot , you pretty wild creature
1	you are not completely drunk yet ?
1	and why do not you work , why are not you at your duty , if you are in the service ?
1	she walked away , but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again
1	in the evening she quite often had gatherings of five or six acquaintances , not more
1	she gave her maid katka such a shawl of mine that , even if she lived in luxury before , she maybe never saw the like
1	you should not have suspected your negotiant neighbor of smelling bad i just kept quiet and laughed
1	i will swear an oath the headman 's accounts are a pack of lies
1	i have certainly missed my proper career
1	seeing cossacks ( les cosaques ) on the other side and the spreading steppe ( les steppes ) , in the middle of which lay moscou la ville sainte , [ ] capital of that state , similar to the scythian state to which alexander the great had marched—napoleon , unexpectedly for everyone , and contrary to both strategic and diplomatic considerations , ordered an advance , and the next day his troops started crossing the niémen
1	mon cher , you might oh , never mind , never mind , i interrupted , i will tell only a little about touchard
1	but what did you think ?
1	she was gazing at the ceiling and moving her lips , and her expression was happy , as if she could see death , her deliverer , and was whispering to him
1	pierre silently held his fiancee 's hand and looked at her beautiful breast rising and falling
1	if you are killed , english l : a brother chats with his sister justice will , i hope , be somewhat obliged to me for having spared them the trouble
1	silence lasted for some seconds
1	what do you think ?
1	and just then the wife of colonel ferzing—an infantry regiment was stationed in town— was hurrying to catch the ferry
1	oh , don ’ t worry , i interrupted again , taking hold of the door handle , last week b—n examined me ( again i put b—n into it ) and my case is decided
1	the extreme , almost unnatural tension that had so far sustained ippolit had reached that ultimate degree
1	i , too , would wish for nothing except to live through it all over again
1	at the end of her letter she informed him that in a few days she would be arriving in petersburg from abroad
1	you told me nothing about it before the wedding , however
1	it 's none of my business
1	how simple and clear it is , thought pierre
1	if he were to die now—all that 's left is a skimpy pension , sir
1	but you were sick , and sickness weakens the head , so i excuse you for it
1	he would not understand , but anyhow , i think , yes
1	a quarrel broke out one day , he did not know how
1	natasha , who had long anticipated that they would come to fetch her to nurse the baby , heard the nanny call and went to the nursery
1	mlle bourienne , who was in the drawing room , looked at princess marya with bewildered astonishment
1	there you have my biography !
1	that is not my phrase
1	he 's kind towards our family and has even contributed , but i myself , i personally , have never taken money from him
1	the absurd law is completely paralyzed
1	ferdyshchenko tittered , though somewhat astounded by the generally much too unpleasant impression his story had made
1	do not i see that , du train que nous allons , [ ] our fortune wo not last long !
1	to the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery , he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position , his poverty and helplessness , and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding
1	i : ivan fyodorovich shponka it 's four years now that ivan fyodorovich shponka has been retired and living on his farmstead in vytrebenki
1	what do you advise me ?
1	it was one of katerina ivanovna 's characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours
1	we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch
1	he recalled again that in his whole life he had never once pitied marfa or been gentle with her
1	in that case ( so i felt ) , if she had guessed the truth and knew i was not asleep , then i had already crushed her by my readiness to accept death , and her hand might now falter
1	well , then , can i see porthos ?
1	having put on french uniforms and shakos , petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had looked at the camp , and , riding out of the forest in total darkness , descended into the hollow
1	the old woman was a mistake perhaps , but she is not what matters !
1	when do we go , your excellency ?
1	it 's hardly civil , porfiry petrovitch , but perhaps i wo not allow it !
1	almost every time a new carriage drove up , a whisper ran through the crowd and hats were doffed
1	porthos presented his compliments to master coquenard and bade him farewell
1	it was just past four
1	i am foaming at the mouth , but bring me some little doll , give me some tea with a bit of sugar , and maybe i will calm down
1	then how schneider gave me his opinion of my character and urged me …
1	i will drag him to rodya , and then to you , so that you will get two reports in the hour—from the doctor , you understand , from the doctor himself , that 's a very different thing from my account of him !
1	he has changed his mind since last night
1	i am saying that you are a scoundrel !
1	i should think you are fairly starving ?
1	he had not even thought of saying this , but it was suddenly said of itself
1	i took her almost all the way home and gave her my address
1	how did you find me , by the way ?
1	between two and three they have dinner together , in the evening they do his homework together and weep
1	lebeziatnikov saw the point
1	très intelligent et bavard !
1	he remembered his mother 's love for him , his family 's , his friends ' , and the enemy 's intention to kill him seemed impossible
1	have mercy on me , my good friend
1	thus athos found resources in his household that he was not expecting at all
1	whenever he appeared at an auction , everyone despaired beforehand of acquiring a work of art
1	too early or too late frightening !
1	but the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened
1	well , ivan nikiforovich , you fuss over your gun like a fool over a fancy purse ivan ivanovich said vexedly , because he was indeed beginning to get angry
1	he was unable to weep
1	pyotr petrovitch , edging by her , went to the opposite corner where sonia was
1	a nice acquaintance , my friend
1	this theory seems irrefutable precisely because the act of transferring the wills of the people can not be verified , since it never took place
1	i brought it for you , sir , lebedev picked up hotly
1	he fell out of his carriage after dinner … struck his temple on the hitching post and passed away right there , like a baby , like a little baby
1	you reject music and painting
1	besides , she had a thousand precautions to take , a thousand counsels to give her defender , so that he would avoid explanations with the count in front of witnesses
1	before we would gone a quarter of the way , i suddenly heard a shout behind me : someone called my name
1	i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy , and as of tomorrow he will admit you without any payment
1	meanwhile , mousqueton continued on his route , and , crossing the pont-neuf , constantly driving the two nags before him , came to the rue aux ours
1	i ’ ve already told you , my much-esteemed prince , that i not only have a soft spot for him , but even love him , sir
1	left alone , d'artagnan read and reread his note , then kissed and rekissed twenty times those lines written by his beautiful mistress 's hand
1	what about the police office ?
1	where are we now ?
1	meanwhile , nesvitsky , zherkov , and the officer of the suite stood together out of the range of fire and looking at this small bunch of men in yellow shakos , dark green jackets embroidered with cord , and blue breeches , pottering about by the bridge and , on the other side , at blue coats and groups with horses , which could easily be identified as artillery , approaching in the distance
1	this was an extraordinary moment !
1	cried the prince , looking at him with tender reproach and trying to embrace him
1	well , don ’ t triumph , wait a moment , the touchy nephew cried , don ’ t be so glad
1	i sat and listened with half an ear ; they talked and laughed , but in my head was nastasya egorovna with her news , and i could not wave her away
1	but this , too , is chance , that people were standing there and saw it
1	it was a strange face , like a mask ; white and red , with bright red lips , with a flaxen beard , and still thick flaxen hair
1	he asked in alarm
1	at six o'clock i saw sonia get up , put on her kerchief and her cape , and go out of the room and about nine o'clock she came back
1	it ’ s an insulting , false , and inappropriate assumption !
1	excuse me , young man , has it ever happened to you hm well , to petition hopelessly for a loan ?
1	she … do you think she ’ ll really marry rogozhin , as she writes here in these letters ?
1	two hours later the carts stood in the yard of the bogucharovo house
1	well , that 's just it !
1	i mean that you are a slanderer , that 's what my words mean !
1	they left the table and sat on the porch , which took the place of a balcony
1	last night i began reading a story describing an old man and his daughter
1	he had actually wept for three days , while the prince remained in petersburg , but during those three days he had also come to hate the prince for looking upon him much too compassionately , whereas the fact that he had returned so much money was something not everyone would bring himself to do
1	excuse me , monsieur , but i doubt he can receive you at this moment
1	moment the youth arrived with the carriage ; on learning that the carriage was no longer needed , he became terribly frightened
1	so what is our position ?
1	and so on and so forth
1	sonia cried in distress
1	only understand in what position you have placed her and myself in the eyes of the whole of society and even of the court , he added , lowering his voice
1	but others need you to go there
1	the smoke was followed by the sound of a distant shot , and it could be seen how our troops speeded up at the crossing
1	he did not know how to rob ; he could only murder
1	to talk of what would have happened if napoleon had sent in his guard is the same as talking about what would happen if autumn became spring
1	adelaida had just noticed a tree in the park , a wonderful old tree , branchy , with long , crooked boughs , all in young green , with a hole and a split in it ; she had decided that she had , she simply had to paint it !
1	they simply spit in my face
1	i was wrong , it seems , and i ask you to pardon me for that
1	the adversaries had the right to fire at any time while coming to the barrier
1	let my life go , if only my dear ones may be happy !
1	i was not mistaken , he said
1	as you like , ivan nikiforovich , but i do not know what 's holding you back
1	but though by the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of their actions , though they would have been glad to stop , some incomprehensible , mysterious power still went on governing them , and the artillery men , sweaty , covered with powder and blood , reduced to one in three , though stumbling and gasping from fatigue , kept bringing charges , loaded , aimed , applied the slow match ; and the cannonballs , with the same speed and cruelty , flew from both sides and crushed human bodies flat , and the terrible thing continued to be accomplished , which was accomplished not by the will of men , but by the will of him who governs people and worlds
1	he added with extreme fear
1	how is it you said first that you were here on business ?
1	and i could just go on standing before her and never take my eyes off her !
1	they explained the affair to him and told him how urgent it was for him to find a place for kitty among all his high-born acquaintances
1	you know , for some reason i think there ’ s actually something serious in it , even on her part
1	then god will send you life again
1	she set the washstand down and , without further talk , announced that it was absolutely necessary to wash
1	confide my shame to you ?
1	it 's none of your business
1	and he took one of the soldiers by the shoulder and kicked him with his knee
1	do you have any idea , asked d'artagnan , who the leader of this infernal expedition was ?
1	ippolit is at least an untroublesome fool , but anatole is a troublesome one
1	forasmuch as , though your exterior would not command respect , my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking
1	it flashed , but only flashed
1	'you have been so busy to‐day , arkady ivanovitch , you have forgotten to wind the dining‐room clock , she said
1	he did not want to be a hussar or a chevalier of st george like uncle nikolai ; he wanted to be learned and intelligent and kind , like pierre
1	and he did not want to go home
1	he 's still in the cradle and already wants to smoke a pipe
1	all that he had precisely been charged with , all the government property he was supposed to have evacuated , was still in moscow
1	he , too , had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her , but found raskolnikov in his way
1	however , he was smiling , but all his goodnaturedness , all the femininity of expression he had had till then , suddenly disappeared
1	at least he will be looked after at home they will help him at once
1	andrei yefimych lay there with bated breath : he waited in terror to be hit again
1	the floorboy asked if he wanted a bite to eat ; he answered absentmindedly that he did , and on second thought was furious with himself , because eating would take an extra half hour , and only later did he realize that nothing prevented him from leaving the food uneaten on the table
1	katerina ivanovna nodded towards the landlady
1	never mind , i will ask the masters , they will give you a horse
1	i wo not go there anymore , and i assure you that i have absolutely no interest there , he concluded resolutely
1	natasha knew it was not prince andrei moaning
1	but wherever it turns , there will always be a swirl preceding its movement
1	here and there they gathered in groups , on the pavement , especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys
1	you may rest assured !
1	killing her was atonement for forty sins
1	we ran out to the stairs
1	prince andrei entered the dining room
1	after nikolay 's confession , on that very day had come the scene with sonia ; his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand ; he had grown feebler , instantly and fundamentally !
1	does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble ?
1	while the sovereign was still in vilno , the army was divided in three : the first army was under the command of barclay de tolly , the second under the command of bagration , the third under the command of tormasov
1	she was a lively , sincere girl , with deep convictions , and it was interesting to listen to her , though she talked a lot and loudly—perhaps because she was used to talking at school
1	do you know the details ?
1	the year , rd of april
1	it was an instant of full , direct , purely instinctive joy
1	on the counter lay some sliced cucumber , some pieces of dried black bread , and some fish , chopped up small , all smelling very bad
1	once outside of town , d'artagnan quickened his pace and caught up with the gentleman as he was entering a little wood
1	and i am drinking it !
1	and yet , had she been a man , she would have attempted all that , and would perhaps have succeeded
1	as if you ’ d say yes !
1	and so , the battle of borodino took place not at all as it is described ( in an attempt to conceal the mistakes of our commanders and thereby diminishing the glory of the russian army and people )
1	dounia crimsoned , razumihin knitted his brows
1	this relation consists in the following :
1	she slipped between the pots to the other side of the plants and stopped , her head lowered
1	what liza liked in vasin was his sympathy with her position , and , as it had seemed to her from the first , his sympathy for the prince as well
1	who do you think you are ?
1	i have the semblance of a beast , but katerina ivanovna , my spouse , is a person of education and an officer 's daughter
1	such a watery place
1	sonia and polenka rushed after them
1	how , with what to make an end ?
1	nadya said worriedly , why do not you go to a doctor , why do not you look after your health ?
1	in the final end i have come to ask you to appoint me an hour for a serious conversation , and in this lies my chiefest hope
1	alexandra , stop by for a minute
1	je vous le ramènerai tout à l'heure , monsieur dessales
1	katerina pays no heed to anyone ; the madwoman has no fear of water nymphs , she runs about late at night with her knife out , searching for her father
1	let 's go to her , i must say good-bye !
1	but the cursed jewess wo not believe us , she will think we stole it ; besides , i just came from the tavern
1	we have just made our calculations with a spartan stinginess , and we will need fifteen hundred livres each
1	and hurrah ! —which , ever growing and swelling , merged into a deafening roar
1	what am i to do ?
1	it seemed to me that this unexpected question was an invitation to one of those
1	ashamed of his tears !
1	indeed he was wearing a shabby old coat that was too long for him
1	if i would seen her before as she is now , thought nikolai , i would have asked her long ago what i should do , and i would have done whatever she told me , and everything would be right
1	i have no reason to defend the man
1	perfectly , said the dragoon
1	darya alexeevna , do you see this bouquet man , this monsieur aux camélias , he ’ s sitting there and laughing at us …
1	once only did i allow myself to smile at her things
1	he thought it , and meanwhile he went on sitting in the same place
1	the three musketeers our gascon advanced without risk , because he knew where he was going
1	you understand , my child , d'artagnan went on , she 's the wife of that ugly ape you saw on the doorstep when you came here
1	the fourth : the viceroy will take the village ( borodino ) and cross its three bridges , proceeding at the same level as the divisions of morand and gérard ( of which it is not said where and when they would move ) , which , under his command , will head for the redoubt and fall in with the other troops of the army
1	leaving the volchaninovs ' that evening , i went away with the impression of a very long , idle day , and the sad awareness that everything in this world , however long , comes to an end
1	sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at svidrigaïlov
1	ask the count to come to me
1	you might let him die in peace , at least , she shouted at the crowd , is it a spectacle for you to gape at ?
1	if you pull it out , it ’ s yours , the whole hundred thousand is yours !
1	to teach us morals , or what ?
1	it 's awfully stupid though
1	so that i may very likely be able to send to you not twenty‐five , but thirty roubles
1	the battle , which consisted merely in the capture of a french squadron , was presented as a brilliant victory over the french , and therefore the sovereign and the whole army , especially while the powder smoke still hung over the battlefield , believed that the french were defeated and were retreating against their will
1	i should have found plenty to tell you
1	my friend , tell me : well , is it possible to imagine that they want to put me in a madhouse ?
1	can we occupy ourselves with education together , if not now , then in the future ?
1	i ca not be
1	slowly as the unknown man had been walking , he had still gotten away ; or perhaps he had gone into some house
1	i locked him in that he should not escape
1	the fourth horse had arrived
1	i do not want to
1	despite so many years of separation , you have now treated my grief and even myself with such perfect sympathy that i naturally feel grateful
1	a perfect child , and even quite pathetic ; he has fits of some illness ; he ’ s just come from switzerland , straight from the train , strangely dressed , in some german fashion , and besides without a penny , literally ; he ’ s all but weeping
1	i like that sort , said dounia
1	finally she heard the creak of the gates being opened
1	but , besides a feeling of respect , pfuel inspired a feeling of pity in prince andrei
1	then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years ?
1	allow me , madam allow me
1	the son sighed , admitting by this sigh that his father had understood him
1	aramis reflected for a moment and said , blushing : this will really be doing you a service , d'artagnan ?
1	but here the captain 's widow turned up
1	we will have to go there
1	she would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers
1	everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that
1	have we crushed every last one of them ?
1	having done so , he went back to bed more calmly , began thinking about the poverty and pitifulness of the artist 's lot , about the thorny path that lay before him in this world ; and meanwhile his eyes involuntarily looked through the chink in the screen at the sheet-covered portrait
1	maybe i invented it
1	why , he was accused of the murder , razumihin went on hotly
1	a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once for the boyars
1	where has he gone ?
1	well , then everybody stand back , i do as i like !
1	there was no longer any doubt ; felton was convinced ; felton was hers
1	and in any case there was no point in going today ; he knew that
1	i dreamed terribly , i would dream for three months at a time , shrinking into my corner , and , believe me , in those moments i bore no resemblance to that gentleman who , in the panic of his chicken heart , sat sewing a german beaver to the collar of his overcoat
1	nikolai was saying to himself all the while the wolf moved towards him , drawing away from the woods
1	there was a rumor that general ivan fyodorovich and his wife lizaveta prokofyevna were partly responsible for evgeny pavlovich ’ s visit
1	he watched and felt himself at the height of bliss
1	appeased hunger and the wine made the captain still more lively , and he talked ceaselessly during dinner
1	i dressed up in a peasant kaftan and big boots , put on a drunken , boorish mug , and went to the ticket agent : ' gim me a little ticket , your honor
1	he never asked till now !
1	having begun farming out of necessity , he quickly developed such a passion for it that it became his favorite and almost sole occupation
1	may i , louisa ivanovna ?
1	no , listen , if you are going to judge a man , you must know the case
1	you are always thinking of something unpleasant , he cried with aversion
1	kolya came all the way in the door and handed the prince a note
1	nastasya filippovna laughed loudly at him
1	the general with the bandaged head , leaning forward as if fleeing from danger , went up to kutuzov with long , rapid strides of his thin legs
1	i swear to you , it was not me ; i met her by the gate
1	she listened attentively to an account of the workmen 's associations in france , too
1	in the house all was completely asleep ; the coachman had great difficulty finding the valet , who brought his master through the drawing room and handed him over to the chambermaid , following whom chertokutsky somehow reached his bedroom and lay down next to his young and pretty wife , who was lying there looking lovely in her white-as-snow nightgown
1	there 's just been another one , and i thought you were never coming home !
1	his valet , who , by an unforeseen misfortune , had picked a quarrel with some agents of the authorities , who were disguised as stable boys xxvii : the wife of athos ah , you wretch !
1	i am poor , but noble
1	the student answered me with his tir-lir-li
1	ah , it 's that she 's come !
1	oh , you don juan !
1	that is , i am a novice
1	they constantly kissed each other , spoke tender words to each other , and spent most of their time together
1	devil take that sort of beauty , and furthermore , devil take that sort of profit !
1	better imagine—yes , it 's certainly better—imagine that i am vain , envious , malicious , base , vindictive and
1	a day or two after the epanchins moved to the country , prince lev nikolaevich myshkin arrived from moscow on the morning train
1	i didn ’ t need anything else
1	does my father know about it ?
1	he was in a gold-embroidered uniform with a big standing collar ; he had kidskin trousers on ; at his side hung a sword
1	he did not repeat , as then , with morbid shame , the words he had spoken , did not say to himself : ah , why did not i say it , and why , why did i say 'je vous aime ' then ?
1	we had a waterfall there , not a big one , it fell from high up the mountain in a very thin thread , almost perpendicular—white , noisy , foamy ; it fell from a great height , but it seemed low ; it was half a mile away , but it seemed only fifty steps
1	now no word is spoken among us without dolokhov ; they swear by him , they invite people for him as if he was a sterlet , said shinshin
1	a strange and terrible demon had fastened on to him definitively , and would no longer let him go
1	when i said of the lady that she was as beautiful as you are , i was being clever : i pretended that it had escaped me accidentally , as if i had not even noticed ; i knew very well that women value such escaped praise more highly than any polished compliment you like
1	that was all there was in the room
1	i have no idea !
1	hold your tongue ; it is not with this weapon of yours that i have come to fight with you …
1	then she rushed furiously about the yard , tearing down all the laundry , hers or not hers , flinging it to the ground and trampling on it
1	a piece of writing on someone else 's topic , produced under someone else 's guidance , goes by a different name
1	there 's your thousand-ruble dogs for you—right you are !
1	he fell silent , and this silence , so terrible for countess marya , went on for about a minute
1	get in , get in !
1	i had long been intending to do this , for two years or so – solely to prove to him that he dared not get so puffed up over me , and that if i wished i could always not give him his wages
1	the police chief glanced back fearfully at that moment , said something to the coachman , and his horses picked up speed
1	it seemed to him that the houses all turned their countless fiery eyes on him and stared
1	piskarev felt one elderly man of respectable appearance seize him by the button of his tailcoat and present for his judgment some quite correct observation of his , but he rudely pushed him away without even noticing that he had a rather significant decoration around his neck
1	yes , and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness
1	if you say you are weak yourself , you must and your visitors ?
1	she laughed in his face at his declarations of love , at his gestures , at his offers
1	he saw that poor akim petrovich had even lowered his eyes , as if he were guilty of something
1	i can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me , and i want to know it ; and of you , whether i am dear to you , whether you esteem me , whether you are the husband for me
1	he then took me by the shoulders , turned me face to the field , and—really proved to me that he was indeed the strongest one in our high school
1	oh , i want to
1	and no threats , if you please !
1	cher prince , are you bored ?
1	monsieur le duc , said the king , i understand , rest assured
1	wouldo not move , whatever you may hear
1	the old with the old , the young with the young , the hostess by the tea table , on which there were exactly the same cakes in a silver basket as the panins had at their soirée—everything was exactly the same as with everyone else
1	his daughter tucked some down-filled chintz pillows behind his back and under him
1	but what about the ear‐rings ?
1	well , if you want , i ’ ll kiss your hand right now
1	varvara ardalionovna came in
1	from which it obviously follows that the oft-mentioned sow was undoubtedly put up to it by the adversary himself , the self-styled gentleman , ivan , son of ivan , pererepenko , already exposed as a robber , attempted murderer , and blasphemer
1	one cannonball , a second , a third flew over him , landing in front , on the sides , behind
1	i expect you have not talked to anyone for some days ?
1	what do you think ?
1	pierre had been choosing a career for three months already and had done nothing
1	not because he had his hair curled at the barber 's , not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit , but because he is a spy , a speculator , because he is a skin‐flint and a buffoon
1	if akaky akakievich transgressed the order of things by desiring a new overcoat ( by desiring anything at all ) , and is punished most terribly for it in the phantasmal world of petersburg , he also returns as a phantom himself and has his revenge
1	vera and shinshin were playing chess in the drawing room
1	oh , mercy on us—marfa petrovna svidrigaïlov
1	children look that way at someone they love very much , when they are asking for something
1	you ca not help getting pale if you have nothing to eat , he added , with difficulty articulating the words
1	and suddenly i became vexed that i was grumbling : she 's maybe the only one i love , and it 's her that i torment
1	i am the same way myself have you read livingstone 's travels ?
1	oh , i know that , i will remember
1	the calm ilagin , nikolai , natasha , and the uncle flew along , not knowing how or where , seeing only the dogs and the hare , and only fearing to lose sight , even for a moment , of the course of the chase
1	half of it had recently been incorporated into the town , the other half remained a village
1	raskolnikov waved him off
1	and in smolensk he also reasoned correctly that the french might outflank us and that they had the greater force
1	sonia heard raskolnikov 's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table
1	his clothes were on the dirty side
1	you have one second to make up your mind , he said
1	it 's a fish that likes space
1	maybe you did not know it yourself , but it was so , because you did feel all that
1	several captive officers , in order to see better , climbed the wall of the charred house by which pierre was standing
1	the prince gave lebedev a strange look
1	the walls looked as though they were made of planks , covered with shabby paper , so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable , though the general colour—yellow—could still be made out
1	it 's the moon that makes it so still , weaving some mystery , thought raskolnikov
1	you don ’ t know rogozhin ?
1	certainly , nothing else to be done
1	the next morning they started late and again stopped so many times that they only reached great mytishchi
1	and something trembled in aglaya ’ s voice
1	i have already ordered it cleared on the avenue
1	but how is this possible ?
1	but it was all impudent and careless
1	does that suffice you , athos asked his adversary , and do you find me enough of a nobleman to do me the favor of crossing swords with me ?
1	they will tell me there 's no idea here , and precisely nothing new
1	all 's still , the air 's light ; the grass is growing—grow , grass of god ; a bird 's singing—sing , bird of god ; a baby squeals in a woman 's arms—the lord be with you , little person , grow and be happy , youngling !
1	and a whole bowl of dumplings would be poured into a sack
1	she did not utter a word , she did not even look at her , she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl ( we have a shawl , made of drap de dames ) , put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall ; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering and i went on lying there , just as before and then i saw , young man , i saw katerina ivanovna , in the same silence go up to sonia 's little bed ; she was on her knees all the evening kissing sonia 's feet , and would not get up , and then they both fell asleep in each other 's arms together , together yes and i lay drunk
1	women , pierre said in a low , barely audible voice
1	i have never experienced such hell before
1	two valets were bustling around prince vassily , dressing him ; he himself looked around animatedly and nodded cheerfully to his entering son , as if to say : right , that 's how i need you to look !
1	and we thought you were pavel pavlovich 's friend , but it turns out he was simply boasting
1	what was that about ?
1	god , how guilty i am before you !
1	forgetting his intention not to reveal his knowledge of french , pierre , tearing the pistol away and dropping it , ran to the officer and began speaking to him in french
1	i am staying close here at madame resslich 's
1	he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men
1	said d'artagnan , looking at her for the first time with a certain attention
1	anna sergeevna was touching , she had about her a breath of the purity of a proper , naive , little-experienced woman ; the solitary candle burning on the table barely lit up her face , but it was clear that her heart was uneasy
1	( and his face twisted in spiteful mockery )
1	i don ’ t like this ferdyshchenko of yours : some sort of salacious buffoon
1	the spring , [ ] replied nikolai
1	that 's just what it was not !
1	by evening i had already quite successfully forgotten all the rest , brushed it aside , and i was still perfectly pleased with my letter to simonov
1	but some of the notes he left on the table
1	when she said this to him , he made no reply , but only bowed and once more showed everyone his smile , which said nothing except perhaps this : opinions are opinions , but you see what a good and nice fellow i am
1	let it all be as it has been
1	and even what i am sure of
1	there were soirees on wednesdays
1	only i will get my revenge
1	( she pointed to a man in the crowd )
1	the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road
1	( the lady in mourning had left the office )
1	i saw in the same order that he , bolkonsky ( she uttered that name in a quick whisper ) , is in russia and serving again
1	hugo 's notre dame de paris had also reached a wider public
1	does smolensk lay down the law for us ?
1	you , my dear boy , have been with the regiment next to no time ; here today , tomorrow somewhere else as a little adjutant ; you could not care less if people say : 'there are thieves among the pavlogradsky officers !
1	boris was naming the guests at the table for his new friend pierre , while exchanging glances with natasha , who was sitting across from him
1	wait , that 's not all , pyotr petrovitch detained her , smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners , and you know me little , my dear sofya semyonovna , if you suppose i would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only
1	when they went out to the drawing room for coffee , the old men sat together
1	) ; as for ganechka , i ’ ll comfort him myself , i ’ ve got an idea
1	be quick with the wedding !
1	tréville had grasped his master 's weak side , and it was to that cleverness that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left behind the reputation of having been very faithful in his friendships
1	oh , nothing—tea , vodka , herrings
1	listen , if you please , little countess , she said to natasha with a smile very much like the uncle 's smile
1	katerina fell silent , looking down into the slumbering water ; and the wind sent ripples over the water , and the whole dnieper silvered like a wolf 's fur in the night
1	but , my lord , if the lord chancellor asks me about the motives that have led your grace to so extraordinary a measure , what shall i reply ?
1	i ran and started shouting to him ; but as i could only shout hey !
1	today i went to town , visited—what 's his name ? —the archpriest sidonsky
1	he was not thinking of anything and did not want to think
1	an officer was sent for
1	all these questions about crime , environment , children , recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time
1	she gave me water , looking at me as if lost
1	alpatych , at a more hurried pace than usual , came into the yard and went straight to the shed for his horses and cart
1	mama is sitting beside him ; he strokes her cheeks and hair and looks into her eyes with tender feeling
1	why , it 's not enough ?
1	you can overturn the world with such beauty
1	forgive me if you can , she stopped in the doorway
1	if you wish , i will move it out a little , it 's a bit dark in here
1	i am not dreaming of any folly
1	without you servants of the higher principle , who live consciously and freely , mankind would be insignificant ; developing in natural order , it would wait a long time for the end of its earthly history
1	understand well that i am devoted to these two all-powerful masters , and that my serious efforts will never have any other end than service to the king and to m le cardinal , one of the most illustrious geniuses france has ever produced
1	some twenty men of the sixth company , who were on their way to the village , joined the haulers , and the wattle wall , about thirty-five feet long and seven feet high , curving , crushing and cutting the shoulders of the panting men , moved on down the village street
1	she was told of it in the morning , when the old man and varvara were sitting under the birch tree by the porch drinking tea
1	at that point there is a great block of buildings , entirely let out in dram shops and eating‐houses ; women were continually running in and out , bare‐headed and in their indoor clothes
1	but he could not bring himself to do this
1	what a way to reason !
1	the prince replied , almost bursting into laughter
1	i suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man ?
1	afterwards i spent a whole day sitting over this paper with the prince , and he argued with me very vehemently , though he remained pleased ; only i do not know whether he submitted the paper or not
1	'good friend , to an englishman , interrupted athos
1	the mason was silent for a long time , evidently thinking something over
1	she looked slightly over prince andrei 's head with that confident , habitual look with which one looks at the place of a familiar portrait
1	and that which in a depraved man would arouse bold thoughts , that same thing , on the contrary , made him still more radiant
1	svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it
1	if anyone happens to forget , i ’ ll remind him !
1	to better show readers the cultivation of the p— infantry regiment , we shall add that two of the officers gambled terribly at faro and would lose uniform , visored cap , greatcoat , sword knot , and underwear to boot—something not always found even among cavalrymen
1	but pralinsky 's absurd hu-humaneness had to pass through the underground of duplicity and silence—the failure of velchaninov to tear the very last word either from pavel pavlovich or from himself in the eternal husband ; the putrefaction of souls leading to the senselessly repeated bobok , bobok that haunts the writer of bobok ; and finally the hell of
1	and what a huntsman he was , you wo not find another like him in the whole world
1	i told you it would not be enough
1	how do i know ?
1	i began putting them together , expecting dmitri to come , and there in the passage , in the corner by the door , i stepped on the box
1	she glanced at me quickly and with great curiosity , in which , however , there was a good deal of childishness :
1	is the movement of people during the crusades explained by studies of the godefroys and louis and their ladies ?
1	it was then that i suddenly fell asleep , something that had never happened to me before , at the table , in the armchair
1	but the general stood as if stunned and only looked around senselessly
1	maybe it will be boring and painful for me to be with people
1	it was hard to believe that ivan fyodorovich , in his venerable old age , with his excellent intelligence and positive knowledge of life , and so on and so forth , should be tempted by nastasya filippovna—and that , supposedly , to such an extent that the caprice almost resembled passion
1	murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides
1	yes , to make him come to paris , and once he has come to paris , to draw him into some trap
1	i fled from them to avoid further litigation over pavlishchev ’ s land
1	compassion , love for our brothers , for those who love us , love for those who hate us , love for our enemies—yes , that love which god preached on earth , which princess marya taught me , and which i did not understand ; that 's why i was sorry about life , that 's what was still left for me , if i was to live
1	at the same time , d'artagnan felt planchet slip a note into his hand
1	with a movement quick as thought , he tore open the envelope , despite the cry that kitty uttered on seeing what he was about to do , or rather , what he was doing
1	believe me , i understand
1	he did not keep a serving woman for fear people might think ill of him , but he kept a cook , afanasy , an old man of about sixty , drunk and half-crazy , who had served as an orderly and was able to slap a meal together
1	but does the sorcerer know this melancholy ?
1	modern history , in its theory , has rejected both of these propositions
1	he said and rode on
1	however , i must talk with our court clerk first , to see whether we ca not claim it through the court
1	she wanted to explain to him that this was a mistake , that all was not lost yet , that life could still be beautiful and happy , that he was a rare , extraordinary , and great man , and that she would stand in awe of him all her life , worship him and feel a holy dread
1	there ’ s the kind that loves domination
1	tell me the whole truth !
1	i walked into the room , she was sitting in the same place , sewing , her head bent , but no longer singing
1	and the more i drink the more i feel it
1	marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search
1	i confess , i had even called medji over once and said , listen , medji , we are alone now ; i will lock the door if you like , so no one can see—tell me everything you know about the young miss , what and how she is ?
1	is that , ganya hastened to put in
1	the jack watched me with amazement and sighed
1	sergei kuzmich , from all sides , he said , undoing the top button of his waistcoat
1	if they have backed up , it means they have got business back there
1	but has katerina ivanovna been able to manage with such small means ?
1	they passed out of the picture
1	and the fireworker understood that
1	i will not allow you to do so otherwise , and so meanwhile , good‐bye , as we have evidently nothing to keep us now
1	he yelled , enraged at being spat upon , seizing her by the shoulder and showing her the revolver—naturally just to frighten her
1	how can i assist ?
1	akaky akakievich shook his head and chuckled , and then went on his way
1	for the moment , she wanted nothing more
1	once he ( he was the enemy ) starts peppering the bridge , the old soldier said gloomily , addressing his comrade , you will forget about scratching yourself
1	velchaninov mumbled that he would write to him
1	he cried , struck by a sudden idea
1	no noise from outside reached me , enabling me to measure time ; i merely presumed that it might be seven or eight o'clock in the evening , for it was october and pitch dark
1	in that case , do not worry , she will let herself soften
1	that 's excellent , excellent and noble , is not it ?
1	pulcheria alexandrovna stood overwhelmed
1	i expect from you in your next letter a complete description of the costume of a village deacon , from his underclothes to his boots , with the names used by the most rooted , ancient , undeveloped little russians ; also the names , down to the last ribbon , for the various pieces of clothing worn by our village maidens , as well as by married women , and by muzhiks the exact names for clothing worn in the time of the hetmans
1	that too must have something to do with it , he concluded to himself
1	in these songs they expressed all the feelings that the departing day had given them , praised it , and bade it farewell
1	fear gained more and more mastery over him , especially after this second , quite unexpected murder
1	oh , how sonorous , how beautiful the greek language is !
1	the headman , the delegate , and the village clerk , who were waiting in the front hall of the wing , listened at first with fear and satisfaction to the sound of the young count 's rapping voice rising higher and higher , pouring out terrible and abusive words one after another
1	anyuta began to dress
1	and that will come soon , do not count on your youth
1	a big one even , not a little one—that ’ s why i ’ ve wrapped myself in a mantilla , replied nastasya filippovna , who indeed had turned paler and at moments seemed to suppress a violent shiver
1	one could see them moving their jaws ahead of time with frightful aptitude
1	i have become dissolute since the month of march , alexei ivanovich , and this is how it happened , sir , lend me your ear
1	though five minutes earlier prince andrei had been able to say a few words to the soldiers transporting him , now , with his eyes fixed directly on napoleon , he was silent to him at that moment all the interests that occupied napoleon seemed so insignificant , his hero himself seemed so petty to him , with his petty vanity and joy in victory , compared with that lofty , just , and kindly sky , which he had seen and understood , that he was unable to answer him
1	he himself was carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to employ in moscow
1	throughout the army and in headquarters joyful , though incorrect , rumors were rife about the imaginary approach of columns from russia , about some victory won by the austrians , and about the retreat of the frightened bonaparte
1	i will report it to the superintendent
1	the most usual general abstractions , accepted by almost all historians , are freedom , equality , enlightenment , progress , civilization , culture
1	she does not listen and walks on
1	kovrin was too agitated to speak
1	after these aces and the aristocracy of kolomna come the extraordinarily puny and piddling
1	here 's a letter to prince vassily , and here 's some money
1	i sometimes fancy it like that
1	later , in the course of his first day spent in solitude and idleness ( pierre tried several times , but was unable to fix his attention on masonic manuscripts ) , a thought had vaguely presented itself to him several times , the same thought he had had before about the cabalistic connection between his name and the name of bonaparte ; but this thought that he , l'russe besubof , was destined to set a limit to the power of the beast , still came to him only as one of those fantasies that , without cause or trace , flit through one 's imagination
1	do you know to whom you are saying this ?
1	he 's undecided now whom to attack : you or mlle julie karagin
1	allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity : have you ever spent a night on a hay barge , on the neva ?
1	by morning the night 's fog had left only hoarfrost turning into dew on the heights , but in the hollows the fog still spread its milk-white sea
1	as always happens , the men , who had started out cheerfully , began to halt ; displeasure was voiced , confusion was sensed , they began moving back somewhere
1	that may very well be so
1	they do not seem to understand and ca not understand , but are not a bit ashamed
1	suddenly i run into him at eleven in the evening , the night before the birthday and the ball , at marya petrovna zubkov ’ s , a neighbor of the ordyntsevs
1	the pigs here are fed on homebrew mash mixed with a little flat beer
1	there was a jewish orchestra in town that usually played at weddings , conducted by the tinsmith moisei ilyich shakhkes , who took more than half the proceeds for himself
1	nobody did see him , razumihin answered with vexation
1	who is the curly‐headed one who has just peeped out ?
1	the carriage that 's good
1	but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing , had prepared nothing yet and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six
1	i will come to see you , but you are a scoundrel
1	to begin with , this would transform everything , even his own position ; he would have at once to confess his secret to dounia
1	milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak , therefore she knew him
1	in the opposite case i shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then you must blame yourself
1	and besides , there 's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously , but about that i
1	the subject says about this poor knight ’ :
1	she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him , and put the wooden cross on his neck
1	what will happen , if you should really be taken to the hospital to‐morrow ?
1	and indeed he had only to lie down in order to fall asleep at once like a stone , and he had only to shake himself in order to set about doing something at once , without a second 's delay , the way children , on getting up , take their toys
1	three would be too many , and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves !
1	dresses , cavaliers with cigarettes in their teeth flashed by
1	on the eve of his departure from petersburg , prince andrei brought along pierre , who had not once been to the rostovs ' since the time of the ball
1	she looked up at him with a burning , reproachful glance
1	and so , from the very depths of my being , from all my strength , a protest began to rise , and i choked with a feeling of boundlessly exaggerated arrogance and defiance
1	he glanced back hastily at the door , looked around , and , leaning towards me from the sofa , whispered in a frightened voice : cher ami !
1	if , for instance , he was , on top of that , also an official , it was solely because for him the service , too , had turned , so to speak , into one of the duties of his married life ; he served for the sake of his wife and her social position in t— , though he was in himself quite a zealous official
1	you are a kind and charming young man , said mme bonacieux
1	to whomever you order , your majesty
1	avdotya romanovna was remarkably good looking ; she was tall , strikingly well‐proportioned , strong and self‐reliant—the latter quality was apparent in every gesture , though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements
1	now , to his surprise , he discovered that there were no more doubts and perplexities in all these questions
1	the countess was accustomed to this tone , which always preceded something ruinous for their children , like some sort of building of a gallery or conservatory , the organizing of a home theater or musical performances—and being accustomed to it , she considered it her duty always to fight against whatever was expressed in that timid tone
1	take those for yourself , entirely for yourself , and let that be strictly between ourselves , so that no one knows of it , whatever you hear
1	she said , in a concentrated voice
1	good heavens , they have killed him , they have killed a man !
1	at the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle
1	i did not finish , she hurried on , turning more red
1	sleep , sleep , he repeated in a weak voice
1	i remember a lot
1	he was right when he said to his sister that the sick boy had improved
1	others have lowered themselves so far as to disobey sentries and guards officers , abusing and beating them
1	they each insisted on going ahead of the other
1	now and then he was tempted to swear at them , to jeer at them , while they could not open the door !
1	i did not think there could be two sapphires of so fine a water
1	what is it , liza , what is it ?
1	she was standing sideways to the table
1	pierre acknowledged that it was true , and starting with that question , guided gradually by the questions of princess marya and especially natasha , was drawn into a detailed account of his adventures
1	when he brought the portrait to the door , the eyes stared still more strongly
1	as for the previous word he talks about in his letter and which supposedly lit up his whole life , there he ’ s lying brazenly
1	people are his instruments
1	raevsky , with an impatient expression , twirling the black hair on his temples with a habitual gesture , glanced now at kutuzov , now at the door
1	prince nikolai andreich winced and said nothing
1	the woman would be very frightened and hurriedly walk away , but we would also quicken our pace and— go on with our thing
1	having jumped into the bedroom and stumbled over the bed , i noticed at once that there was a door from the bedroom to the kitchen , which meant a way out of my trouble and a possibility of escape , but—oh , horror ! —the door was locked and the key was not in the lock
1	go on , take it to court !
1	that amalia ludwigovna , ah !
1	lying behind the door ?
1	raskolnikov joined the throng of women , who were talking in husky voices
1	[ ] anna pavlovna said to the arriving guests , and led them quite seriously to a little old lady in high ribbons , who had come sailing out of the next room as soon as the guests began to arrive , called them by name , slowly shifting her gaze from the guest to ma tante , and then walked away
1	until noon on the nineteenth , the movement , animated conversation , running , and sending of adjutants were limited to the emperors ' headquarters ; after noon of the same day the movement spread to the headquarters of kutuzov and the staffs of the leaders of columns
1	and he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov
1	you felt something extraordinary and hot , like that scorching sandy desert with its lions , in which the saint wandered
1	on the fourth floor they stopped outside a low door
1	she blushed all over
1	he said resolutely ; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office
1	only then , as if through sleep , did he remember looking for some treasure , being afraid in the forest alone
1	but on the eve of holy monday , late at night , there suddenly came a sinister knocking at the gate ; someone banged on the wicket as on a barrel : boom !
1	so in this way , rodion romanovitch , i reached the furthest limit , and knocking my head against a post , i pulled myself up , asking myself what i was about
1	he fixed a strained intent look on his sister , but did not hear or did not understand her words
1	go on , ninny , you will miss her !
1	he spoke gently , though not without a certain ruefulness in his speech
1	let it all be as you have said , but you , too , will sit there eternally on your horse , and as long as you sit there on your horse , there will be no kingdom of heaven for you !
1	for we are always able to pay up for our little third-class grave
1	how beautiful you are today , liza
1	it often happened when he was with her that he would begin to argue , to think aloud , and she responded to that each time either by a brief but appropriate remark , showing that it did not interest her , or by a silent smile and glance , which showed pierre her superiority most palpably
1	now decide for yourself , as you know best , whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not
1	having played two rubbers , chertokutsky again found a glass of punch under his hand , which he , forgetting himself , again drank off , after first saying , it 's time , gentlemen , really , it 's time i went home
1	yes ; the porter and nastasya were standing there
1	she sighed , lost in thought
1	dumas was bent on having his play performed at the comédie française
1	outside it was still light
1	and it surely has , ganya observed
1	capitaine , ils ont de la soupe et du gigot de mouton dans la cuisine , he said
1	she asked herself in perplexity : what is he looking for in me ?
1	that means she wanted to herself … well , good-bye , it ’ s time for us both
1	he said , seeing ivan fyodorovich
1	why , then this strapping lad is the devil in person !
1	go get the clothes ready
1	i respond to pain with cries and tears , to meanness with indignation , to vileness with disgust
1	after another five days , the young prince nikolai andreich was baptized
1	was this ivan ivanovich ?
1	the empress , who did in fact have very shapely and lovely feet , could not help smiling at hearing such a compliment from the lips of a simple-hearted blacksmith , who , in his zaporozhye outfit , could be considered a handsome fellow despite his swarthy complexion
1	each feeling and thought lives separately in me , and in all my opinions about science , the theater , literature , students , and in all the pictures drawn by my imagination , even the most skillful analyst would be unable to find what is known as a general idea or the god of the living man
1	with her , he was always very patient , considerate even
1	and some of them said , could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
1	she gets up and paces in agitation
1	you are in a government office , too , cried raskolnikov , and you are smoking a cigarette as well as shouting , so you are showing disrespect to all of us
1	before him sat a totally different woman , not at all like the one he had known till then and had left only that july in the village of delight
1	at first he was for making up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity : 'how , said he , 'can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that ?
1	il jette feu et flamme contre tout le monde , s'empare des lettres , les décacheté , et lit celles de l'empereur adressées à d'autres
1	akaky akakievich walked along in a merry state of mind , and even suddenly ran , for some unknown reason , after some lady who passed by like lightning , every part of whose body was filled with extraordinary movement
1	a young doctor comes in , wearing a new black two-piece suit , gold-rimmed spectacles , and , sure enough , a white tie
1	remembering , sketchily , the main outlines of his recent scene with porfiry , he could not help shuddering again with horror
1	then you have doubly offended me , said porthos , disengaging the procureuse 's arm from his own , for if you are rich , mme coquenard , then there is no more excuse for your refusal
1	we must take off his clothes
1	she felt somehow ashamed
1	the door opened and razumihin came in
1	he thus resolved to defend the door bravely ; and since , having been betrayed by the mistress of the inn , he could not say that aramis was not there , he tried to prove to the new arrival that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in the pious conference he had entered upon that morning , which , according to bazin , could not possibly end before evening
1	both were pale , and the expression or their faces—one of them glanced timidly at pierre— had something in it similar to what he had seen in the young soldier at the execution
1	certainly to porfiry , razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement
1	i have just been with the priest 's son
1	then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole : but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen
1	as a matter of fact , we do not know precisely with what offers he wrote , but he wrote every day , every hour , letter after letter !
1	it 's not a matter of permission or prohibition
1	you know , marie , natasha said suddenly with a mischievous smile , which princess marya had not seen on her face for a long time
1	and though the fact with the teacher 's wife was not repeated , though he did not set anyone on a peg leg , the mere thought that this would certainly have to be repeated , if the circumstances were such , nearly killed him at times
1	the crimea i mean , the caucasus
1	and so , while the others would go in hired carriages to visit small landowners , he sat at home and exercised himself in occupations dear only to a meek and kindly soul : polishing his buttons , reading a fortune-telling book , setting mousetraps in the corners of his room , and , finally , taking off his uniform and lying in bed
1	that , too , is a lie !
1	pavel pavlovich said with a humbly submissive smile at himself
1	the face of this young woman was completely unknown to her
1	i know it very well , because prince vassily told me himself
1	though she had invented it herself , she believed in it firmly by this time
1	i lay down , and there was nothing in my thoughts
1	you could take the housekeeper 's little room for a while
1	they agreed on fifteen kopecks
1	ho-o-ow 's that you are standing ?
1	no , he has not made dounia any presents yet
1	there is a captive princess , there is a prince who is called upon to save her , and there is a dark force that threatens them both
1	thank god , her sufferings are over , but i will tell you everything in order , so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you
1	it ’ s probably just outrageous talk , murmured ganya , also somewhat bewildered
1	countess marya turned pale from fright and began making signs to her son
1	the man ’ s suspiciousness seemed to be increasing more and more ; the prince was too far from fitting into the category of everyday visitors , and though the general had rather often , if not daily , at a certain hour , to receive sometimes even the most varied sorts of visitors , especially on business , still , in spite of habit and his rather broad instructions , the valet was in great doubt ; the secretary ’ s mediation was necessary for the announcement
1	now he , this real russian prince , had come
1	see , even the officer got shoved aside , the halted crowds were saying on different sides , looking at each other , and still pressing forward towards the exit
1	first of all , he felt sorry that natasha , whom he loved most of all in the family , would be leaving home ; second , from his hussar point of view , he was sorry he was not there to show this bolkonsky that connection with him was by no means so great an honor , and that if he loved natasha , he could do without the permission of his crackbrained father
1	ce qu'ils font , ce qu'ils font !
1	with a shriek she rushed like a fury at katerina ivanovna , considering her to blame for everything
1	but m de tréville is a skillful physiognomist , who can judge men at first sight , and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law , m des essarts , while letting you hope that one day or another you would enter the musketeers
1	aramis went on : vanity of vanities !
1	having run to the front hall , natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf
1	she would spend hours at a time making fun of the prince and all but turning him into a buffoon
1	i saw it in your eyes
1	before , he had still sought to give some new pose , to impress with force , with effects
1	everyone has his own plans
1	the pain caused by the transfer to the cottage had made prince andrei moan loudly and lose consciousness again
1	i should like to know one thing more : how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since ?
1	in this village , and in the manor house , and all over the knoll , in the garden , by the wells and the pond , and along the road uphill from the bridge to the village , no more than four hundred yards away , crowds of men could be seen through the undulating mist
1	but i no longer had any wish for their love ; on the contrary , i constantly thirsted for their humiliation
1	but when i finished , he still did not quite agree : that 's all so , he sighed deeply , but how many are there who will endure and not get distracted ?
1	the explainer said and laughed
1	but you remember them all so clearly , and and stupid !
1	raskolnikov looked at him with surprise , not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd
1	you said that porthos was wounded
1	it 's ready , it 's ready , little falcon !
1	no , i never stopped loving liza but , on the contrary , loved her still more , only i did not want to approach her first , though i understood that she would not come to me first for anything
1	now he is off , beating the drum !
1	his eyes glittered as though he were mad , sonia thought , in her turn
1	he called out as i went down the stairs : he was so pleased i was leaving
1	but she ’ s never lived near the bolshoi theater , and my father has never been to nastasya filippovna ’ s , if you want to know
1	excuse me , my dear m bonacieux , if i impose on you unceremoniously , but nothing makes one so thirsty as lack of sleep , and i have a raging thirst
1	but the stairs , too , were quite deserted ; all the doors were shut ; he met no one
1	non , vrai , avez-vous quelque chose contre moi ?
1	now , i am ridiculously attached to my head , seeing that it seems to go rather well with my shoulders
1	i understood her , thought prince andrei
1	well , granted such chances may even be extremely rare ; all the same , my main rule will be not to risk anything , and the second—to be sure to earn at least something each day over and above the minimum spent on my subsistence , so that the accumulation does not stop for a single day
1	but the pain got its own back and overcame weariness and sleep ; an hour later he awoke and with suffering got up from the sofa
1	i did not wish to change it in any way and tell it almost as simply as i heard it
1	and , followed by his lackey , he set out for the governor 's country house
1	when pierre himself wanted to be unfaithful to his wish , she fought him with his own weapons
1	oh , what an unbearable child !
1	so i really am a princess !
1	and where is lise ?
1	it makes no sense , your honor , it 's not right
1	ah , a fine spot !
1	i have been told positively that people in the last stages of consumption sometimes lose their minds temporarily
1	if only he lives !
1	what had he to look forward to ?
1	as soon as nikolai took her hand , she was unable to restrain herself and began to weep
1	he despised me so much that he talked about me with stebelkov , and yesterday he told me himself that he wanted to throw both me and versilov out
1	but they just laughed at me and in the end began to consider me some sort of holy fool
1	and , of course , i am not rich in patients
1	dear lady , said mme bonacieux , forgive me for interrupting you , but what do you advise me to do ?
1	but then akim petrovich was finished and began to gather up the papers
1	even as it is , she was quite right : she was suffering and that was her asset , so to speak , her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of
1	ah , ma bonne , ma bonne , he said , rising and taking her by both hands
1	it was still , and once in a while from that hill floated the sounds of bugles and the shouts of the enemy
1	incidentally , with regard to the eldest , alexandra , lizaveta prokofyevna did not know whether to fear for her or not
1	his hair was terribly black , his face white and red-cheeked like a mask , his nose long and aquiline , such as frenchmen have , his teeth white , his eyes black
1	she ’ d never spoken with me like that before !
1	nastasya filippovna could not help hearing both the question and the answer , but it seemed to increase her gaiety still more
1	i ca not understand why pyotr petrovitch has not come ?
1	but you know the reason why
1	if i am happy by an error , do not have the cruelty to take it from me
1	in those two months he had had time to think it over and decide , promising himself that he would try at all costs to cancel his father at least for a time , and even to efface him from petersburg , if possible , whether his mother agreed to it or not
1	go kiss your sow !
1	pierre was the only man before whom he would venture to speak himself out ; but then he spoke everything that was in his heart
1	raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery
1	ptitsyn , help me out , you percentage soul , charge whatever you like , get me a hundred thousand by evening : i tell you , i won ’ t stint !
1	sonia clasped her hands
1	after the adjutant , a commissary comes asking where to transport the food supplies , and the head of the hospitals asking where to transport the wounded ; and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign that does not admit the possibility of abandoning moscow , and the commander 's rival , the one who tries to undermine him ( there are always rivals—not one , but several ) , suggests a new plan , diametrically opposed to the plan of going to the kaluga road ; and the commander 's own forces require sleep and fortification ; and a venerable general , overlooked for a reward , comes to complain , and the inhabitants beg for protection ; and an officer sent to survey the terrain comes and reports the complete opposite of what an officer sent out before him had said ; and a spy , a prisoner , and a general who did some reconnoitering all describe the position of the enemy army differently
1	if this man had been endowed with at least some ability to understand the feelings of other people and had guessed pierre 's feelings , pierre would probably have left him ; but this man 's lively imperviousness to everything that was not himself won pierre over
1	he carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages
1	none of them , incidentally , was very drunk ; but they all seemed quite tipsy
1	and the main reason is—i love you like a son
1	you are not really afraid of me !
1	go back to them—be with them be with them to‐morrow and always i perhaps i shall come if i can
1	the rostovs assumed that the address russian guards abroad was a perfectly definite address , and that , if the letter reached the grand duke who was in command of the guards , there was no reason to think it would not reach the pavlogradsky regiment , which should be in the vicinity ; and therefore it was decided to send the letters and money through the grand duke 's courier to boris , and boris would have to deliver them to nikolushka
1	without trying to explain the strange event to himself , pleased merely at having seen not only the black clothes but even the face and eyes of the monk so closely and clearly , feeling pleasantly excited , he returned home
1	surprising there ’ s no doorkeeper , but … it ’ s a holiday , and the doorkeeper is away
1	some two ladies peeped into the front hall from the stairs , hesitating to come in
1	he 's still a young lad , she used to say , despite the fact that ivan fyodorovich was just shy of forty , he ca not know everything !
1	she asked quickly , catching at a straw
1	hello , said the monk and , after some silence , he asked : what are you thinking about now ?
1	the room – narrow , small , and low , encumbered by a huge wardrobe , and littered with cartons , rags , and all sorts of castoff clothing – was almost totally dark
1	the face of the regimental commander , after the happily passed-off review , expressed irrepressible joy
1	no sign of you
1	never mind that i myself have just rejected the crystal edifice , for the sole reason that one can not taunt it with one 's tongue
1	once these dispositions were made , the four valets retired in their turn
1	psyche began to come to life , and the barely glimpsed idea gradually began to be clothed in visible flesh
1	when , at the ball , by the old habit of a courtier of catherine 's time , kutuzov , on the sovereign 's entrance into the ballroom , ordered the captured standards thrown down at his feet , the sovereign winced unpleasantly and spoke some words , among which some heard : old comedian
1	besides princess belokonsky , a certain lady was expected , the wife of a very important gentleman and a dignitary
1	i will tell about myself first of all
1	she said to her son and smiled
1	what , have i dropped words like that ?
1	i admit i have been disposed to that opinion myself , judging from your stupid , repulsive and quite inexplicable actions , and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister
1	he asked in alarm
1	versilov shouted to me
1	however , this happened to me only once
1	count ilya andreich rostov , hurried , preoccupied , paced in his soft boots from dining room to drawing room , greeting in a hasty and perfectly identical manner both important and unimportant persons , all of whom he knew , and , occasionally seeking out his trim , dashing son with his eyes , joyfully rested his gaze on him and winked to him
1	put him straight on the sofa , with his head this way , raskolnikov showed him
1	he was silent for a moment
1	this supposition is the more natural and necessary in that , as we follow the development of historical science , we see that the view of what the good of mankind is changes with each new year , with each new writer ; so that in ten years what seemed good looks like evil , and vice versa
1	they will sneak up on the garden
1	he gave his word
1	if kutuzov decided to stay in krems , the one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-man army of napoleon would cut him off from all communications , surround his exhausted forty-thousand-man army , and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm
1	only life 's adversities can show us its vanity and contribute to our innate love of death , or rebirth into a new life
1	he rode into that space in which the most men fleeing from pratz had been killed
1	her husband 's deaf and stupid , yakov went on , not listening to crutch , a fool of fools , the same as a goose
1	so you are renouncing the world forever ?
1	you see , once again : well , let it be only a dream !
1	it 's past one o'clock
1	breathless with fear , he expected the old man to look behind the screen at any moment
1	and yet they say he 's dishonest and profits from it
1	his excellency ivan afanasyvitch , do you know him ?
1	the empress maria feodorovna , concerned with the welfare of the almshouses and orphanages in her charge , made arrangements to move all the institutions to kazan , and the belongings of these establishments had already been packed
1	this little girl was later mme de sévigné
1	i have only come to find out once for all whether it 's a fact that you are mad ?
1	and boils with rage : katerina 's father appears to him
1	what papers do you mean ?
1	varvara ardalionovna , who must accompany you without fail , knows the place very well
1	he even began to say how dare you , do you realize who is before you ?
1	that ’ s clear from the fact that she invited him to come every day from one till two , and the man drags himself there every day , and she ’ s still not sick of him , mrs epanchin concluded , adding that through the old woman the prince was now received in two or three good houses
1	yes they live there , through that door ?
1	he is a rogue and no mistake
1	zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner
1	aglaya , allow me to kiss your prince !
1	but the wine was gone , the bottle was empty
1	there was probably no one in the park now ; it was certainly at least half-past eleven
1	how is it they all make such a noise ?
1	and you ’ re a fine one , too , papa dear !
1	this is that basis owing to which it is obvious that the drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than a man standing on dry land ; that basis owing to which the actions of a man living in close connection with other people in a densely populated area , the actions of a man who is connected with family , work , enterprises , appear unquestionably less free and more subject to necessity than the actions of man who is single and solitary
1	she was some miraculous blend of our northern beauty with mediterranean beauty , a diamond that rarely occurs in the world
1	instead , the casual collaborator on the firebrand came closer still and , it seemed , was intending to sit down somewhere nearby
1	felton held the weapon out to milady , who tested its temper attentively and tried the point on the tip of her finger
1	he had managed to make himself absolutely necessary in certain quarters , his own department among others
1	now , you know there is nothing more unpleasant than to be disturbed at lunch
1	how could i go to sleep again with nothing done ?
1	the usefulness may , in one case , consist in a moral ; in another , in some practical advice ; in a third , in a proverb or maxim
1	the gentlemen feel it and even printed something about me in a magazine
1	amarmeladov , once already you have deceived my expectations i will take you once more on my own responsibility'—that 's what he said , aremember , he said , 'and now you can go
1	and i , she says , will now call keller and tell him to throw you out the gate
1	the man , moreover , was very unpleasant , evidently depraved , undoubtedly cunning and deceitful , possibly malignant
1	it was in the name of the comte de wardes
1	oh , lord , what 's with him and his little moments !
1	before , too , he had always seemed surprised at my coming
1	the count was at the other end of the room ; the countess , sonya , and she stood alone , as if in a forest , in this crowd of strangers , of no interest or need to anyone
1	and in some of her gestures , this childishness seemed almost absurd
1	consider for yourself : fedosei petrovich has eight girls , and only one little son
1	lord , what drivel i ’ m spouting !
1	and here i , her own father , here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink !
1	all these twenty years , your mother and i have lived in complete silence , he began his palaver ( affected and unnatural in the highest degree ) , and all that has been between us has taken place in silence
1	she ran to the window and opened it
1	with slow faltering steps , with shaking knees , raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret , feeling chilled all over
1	he thought , listening to her timid account
1	the prince fell silent
1	now the door opens without a creak
1	the whole world knows that you are a learned man
1	you know , it 's very likely i will be offered a post as assistant professor of general pathology
1	prince , nastasya filippovna suddenly addressed him sharply and unexpectedly , these old friends of mine , the general and afanasy ivanovich , keep wanting to get me married
1	the general , who hates barclay , goes to his friend , the commander of a corps , spends the whole day with him , returns to barclay , and condemns point by point the future battlefield , which he has not seen
1	it smelled of gaslights and soldiers
1	he had already given a sweet time to two wives and was looking for a third , and so he cast an eye on her : quiet , he thought , grew up in poverty , and i am marrying for my orphans
1	it 's no joke , yesterday they gave the first-year students a fable to learn by heart , and a latin translation , and a problem
1	aksinya , her hair curled , with no dress on , in a corset and creaking new boots , rushed about the yard like a whirlwind , and only her bare knees and breast kept flashing
1	i need time to cut through your bars
1	i was lying at the time well , what of it !
1	god bless you , the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice
1	stand off , mikolka screamed frantically ; he threw down the shaft , stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar
1	would you love me , then , if you were not one yourself , madame , tell me , would you love me then ?
1	vous êtes de fiers ennemis , tout de même
1	there 's where the juice is !
1	at last he opened it ; it was a thick heavy letter , weighing over two ounces , two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting
1	he did not sit down , nor did he invite me to sit down
1	tanya , dear tanya , you are an extremely sympathetic being
1	for the first moment he thought he was going mad
1	and everything seemed so nice to me , everything was so easy
1	the young dostoevsky , in his first novel , poor folk , challenged gogol 's unfeeling treatment of his petty clerk
1	do not accuse me of slavophilism ; i am saying it just so , from misanthropy , because my heart feels heavy !
1	she added , lowering her long eyelashes
1	no matter what you say , i ca not , i said with an air of unshakable resolution
1	but all the same , as i was leaving the court , i made an arrangement with a lawyer , gave him an advance
1	[ ] he said gaily , smiling and looking around him
1	the steward , a very stupid but cunning man , understood the intelligent but naïve count perfectly and played with him as with a toy
1	what 's he doing , getting married ?
1	that must be mikhail fyodorovich
1	he said that , on the contrary , a young and beautiful woman always produces an impression of indignation and wrath in a young man your age anna andreevna suddenly laughed
1	as a matter of fact , our conversation yesterday began on the occasion of this … strange article in the archive
1	you are a strange man and i have listened to you from simple curiosity
1	even now our nobility , having lost its rights , could remain a higher estate as the guardian of honor , light , science , and the higher idea , and , above all , without shutting itself up in a separate caste , which would be the death of the idea
1	cried the police chief , casting one of those looks at ivan ivanovich that a giant casts at a pigmy or a learned pedant at a dancing master
1	after that andrei yefimych began to notice a certain mysteriousness around him
1	i asked you to go , i believe , he turned to the staff officer on duty
1	but what are these people of god ?
1	versilov did not see him off
1	and the things he said yesterday !
1	coming up to the fire and hearing platon 's weak , sickly voice and seeing his pitiful face brightly lit by the fire , pierre felt something stab his heart unpleasantly
1	the cardinal had leaflets thrown over in which he pointed out to the rochelois how unjust , egotistical , and barbaric the conduct of their leaders was
1	the blow would certainly have landed on her face
1	he knew very well that nothing but confusion would come of this battle begun against his will , and , as far was in his power , tried to hold back the troops
1	poorly mounted as the two friends were , they soon got ahead of their valets and arrived at crèvecoeur
1	you do not understand at all , not at all , she said
1	she , too , flushed , and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes
1	but his secret is not hard to guess
1	but i ca not drop her like that !
1	grease our boots and bring the horses from the hôtel
1	you do not think so ?
1	and if we start judging and reasoning about everything , then there will be nothing sacred left
1	well , that was a bad sign raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room , still pondering
1	how she sings today !
1	a piece of meat
1	he 's an honest and very precise german
1	but i forgot myself
1	very well , that 's enough for today
1	m d'artagnan is a young man of barely nineteen or twenty , and monsieur is at least thirty
1	no , it 's not a dream
1	stay , he roared , as raskolnikov was about to move
1	she was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible german
1	then why did he write ?
1	the way you put it is especially intelligent
1	then they crossed the ravine to semyonovskoe , where soldiers were pulling down the last logs of the cottages and barns
1	come in , gentlemen , come in , cried d'artagnan
1	then that same night , as you heard , judas kissed jesus and betrayed him to the executioners
1	but but what if it was impossible to avoid ?
1	she sank back on her haunches , but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force , tugged first on one side and then on the other , trying to move the cart
1	again they were both silent
1	return with confidence to your dwellings : you will soon find ways to satisfy your needs !
1	he was sullen and distracted
1	russia is present in the novel not as a place but as a question — the essence of russia , the role of russia and the russian christ in europe and in the world
1	but if it was your chest , you should have gone to ecke , not to schulz
1	i mean that you are a slanderer , that 's what my words mean !
1	zossimov is a first‐rate fellow !
1	he stopped at shops , bought a newspaper , called at his tailor 's and ordered some clothes
1	but her excitement did not flag , and every moment her irritation grew more intense
1	je suis votre faithful slave , et à vous seule je puis l'avouer
1	it 's in your stomach , uncle !
1	well , yes , yes , you ’ ve really got me worried , the prince interrupted him absentmindedly and with displeasure
1	and are any of them young ?
1	close to the guardhouse , he could see the black outlines of the cossacks ' lean-tos and the horses tethered together
1	we are two brothers , he began , i am ivan ivanych , and he 's nikolai ivanych , some two years younger
1	there wasn ’ t any love here
1	you are my friend today , tomorrow you will be no more than a shade for me ; or , rather , you wo not exist at all
1	show him in , i order
1	it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it
1	yes , a commensurate vehicle !
1	but as soon as one is ill , as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken , one begins to realise the possibility of another world ; and the more seriously ill one is , the closer becomes one 's contact with that other world , so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world
1	i could not talk to her otherwise than on a certain subject , and i was afraid to distract myself from the goals i had set myself by some new and unexpected impression
1	he took the purse , too
1	but all the same i stand up for the ass : an ass is a kind and useful fellow
1	generally , i conducted things too hotly this morning and yesterday
1	he paused and hung his head as if in perplexity
1	the workman shouted , going out to him
1	only konev , vassily vassilyich , rescued me
1	he pondered at times in gloomy rapture
1	however , the bars on the windows and the bolts on the outside of the door decided the case in favor of a prison
1	do you know m de tréville , their captain ?
1	hm he said pensively and as if figuring something out for himself , meaning that it happened precisely an hour before a certain other talk
1	of the four young visitors , however , one was about thirty years old , the retired lieutenant from rogozhin ’ s band , a boxer , who himself used to give fifteen roubles to petitioners
1	i come in and think : they consider me an idiot , but i ’ m intelligent all the same , and they don ’ t even suspect it … ’ i often have that thought
1	but some day i will stop
1	he felt that he was asleep and heard his own snoring
1	they were small factories , and in all employed about four hundred workers , not more
1	versilov , naturally , did not believe then , on first decree of fate
1	the general spoke with aplomb and even drew the words out slightly
1	did no one else wake me up except you ?
1	abandoning that soldier , who was obviously drunk , rostov stopped the horse of an orderly or groom of some important person and began questioning him
1	listen , you are a man of culture and education ?
1	no , my child , no one will touch even one hair on your head
1	his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face
1	she was not such an old woman , about forty-five or -six , no more
1	it also worried him that in the last three days the old man had even stopped drinking entirely
1	ukrainian tales having said that , he was already annoyed with himself for it
1	that is all very praiseworthy , but , forgive me , what ever happened to the friend who told you all those horrors … his punishment was changed , which means he was granted that infinite life
1	but i wo not let anyone here even lay a finger on you !
1	julie became offended and said that it was all true , that a woman needed diversity , that one and the same thing all the time would bore anyone
1	can he really be saved ?
1	it even seemed sad when , after all the previous noise , the old voices were heard singly , one saying , i agree , and another , for the sake of variety , and i am of the same opinion , and so on
1	worse than her master !
1	she mended a shirt for you , too
1	would you believe it , she talks of the silliest trifles and—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry
1	akaky akakievich was about to shout help !
1	in the further wall there was a closed door , beyond it there were no doubt other rooms
1	i was even beginning to find it all amusing
1	pyotr petrovitch waved her off
1	your old method again
1	once , when in the dark room , by the light of the icon lamp , fedosyushka was telling about her life , the thought that fedosyushka alone had found the right way of life suddenly came to princess marya with such force that she herself decided to go wandering
1	but to die was also frightening
1	i would never have believed it , but this feeling is stronger than i am
1	and so the return to la rochelle was profoundly sad
1	he lay facing the back of the sofa and languished while his friend amused him with conversation , or rested while his friend was absent
1	to translate the scullery verb vyskoblit ' ( to scrape out ) as eradicate or expunge , as has been done , to exchange the collar of lard the narrator bestows on the wretched clerk in part two for one that is merely greasy , is to chasten and thus distort the voice of this man who is nothing but a voice
1	i do not understand landscapes and operas , but i think like this : if some intelligent people devote their entire lives to them , and other intelligent people pay enormous amounts of money for them , then it means they are needed
1	it seemed to them that what they had lived through and felt could not be expressed in words
1	open , you stupid , wake up !
1	but shestov means something very different
1	[ ] and napoleon quickly went to the door
1	we must value the ideal !
1	he never blessed his children , but , offering her his bristly , as yet unshaven cheek and giving her a stern and at the same time attentively tender look , merely said :
1	that may be the only chance i will get to see the sovereign
1	what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me ?
1	getting back to my ring , then , or rather to yours : you will take half of the amount we get for it , or i will throw it into the seine , and i doubt whether , as with polycrates , any fish will be so obliging as to return it to us
1	the gentry rode together
1	you wo not make it , i will carry you
1	he asked , suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair
1	he went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room
1	that 's impossible , said prince andrei , as if the matter had long been decided
1	greetings to you , master philosopher !
1	and only when he understood the tastes and strivings of the muzhik , learned to speak his language and understand the hidden meaning of his speech , when he felt akin to him , only then did he begin boldly to manage him , that is , to fulfill in relation to the muzhiks that very duty the fulfillment of which was demanded of him
1	and the two friends began telling each other—the one about his hussar carousing and life at the front , the other about the pleasures and advantages of serving under the command of highly placed persons , and so on
1	stay , he roared , as raskolnikov was about to move
1	and to be called a fool yourself for putting up with the lie ; to endure insults , humiliations , not daring to say openly that you are on the side of honest , free people , and to have to lie yourself , to smile , and all that for a crust of bread , a warm corner , some little rank that 's not worth a penny—no , it 's impossible to live like that any longer !
1	before the fire the black figures of people flitted ; talking and shouting could be heard through the ceaseless crackling of the flames
1	but , once again , where is this gentleman ?
1	i hate and despise , i feel indignant , outraged , afraid
1	he quickly ran up the stairs , knocked at the door : the door opened , and who should come out to meet him ?
1	ordinarily , and even almost always , he was incomparably more fresh and hearty
1	that it was indeed beauty and prayer , that it was indeed the highest synthesis of life , he could not doubt , nor could he admit of any doubts
1	petro gave a start
1	now i have it all worked out and was waiting for you , to ask you all about life abroad
1	some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men , but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will
1	and do you remember , prince , who it was who announced that there will be no more time ’ ?
1	i believe i understood that you have suffered at the hands of the cardinal , milady went on
1	she said unexpectedly , seriously now , suddenly remembering her question earlier
1	the humble hegumen pafnuty here sets his hand to it
1	the countess shook her head disapprovingly and crossly at each solemn phrase of the manifesto
1	( ) the said supplies will be purchased from them for the price agreed upon between the buyer and the seller ; but if the seller does not obtain the fair price he demands , he is free to take them back to his village , and no one can prevent him by any means from doing so
1	and she 's such a grande dame , such a sweet lady , and she clearly loves me with all her heart , thought natasha
1	i ca not help agreeing with you , but
1	i came in with the same stern look on my face , and the old man , instantly noticing it , gave a start , and the smile on his face quickly gave way to decided alarm
1	why have not you done so ?
1	suddenly a pretty little pocketbook dropped from her hand and fell on the ground ; she got in ; the valet bent down to pick up the little thing , but i ran over quickly , picked it up , and handed it to the lady , tipping my hat
1	why are you so pale ?
1	i would be sorry to leave the regiment
1	in the end he coughed up blood
1	'sit there a bit , he said
1	and at the moment when prince andrei ( not with that peevish expression and manner he assumed in drawing rooms , but with the same animated face he had when he talked with pierre ) came to his father 's , the old man was sitting in his dressing room , on a wide morocco-upholstered armchair , in a powdering mantle , entrusting his head to tikhon 's hands
1	pierre looked at him in surprise , unable to grasp what he wanted
1	she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat , but wo not allow herself to be treated with disrespect
1	nous prenons fait et cause pour eux
1	washing hastily and dressing humbly in the poorest of her dresses and an old mantilla , shivering in the fresh air , natasha would go out into the deserted streets , transparently lit up by the glow of dawn
1	me , whom everybody loves so ?
1	long after she had undressed
1	no , listen , she said , you are quite a man now
1	by heaven , said d'artagnan , you are well named , gentlemen , and my adventure , if it causes some stir , will prove at least that your union is not based on contrasts
1	velchaninov glanced at him with scorn and again started pacing the room
1	meanwhile , the uhlan was jostled in the crush by a little merchant , also on a spree , and even outrageously so
1	no , i am asking you
1	and still more terrible for princess marya was the fact that , since the time of her father 's illness ( if not even earlier , when , expecting something , she had stayed with him ) , all her personal desires and hopes , forgotten and dormant in her , had reawakened
1	may i be so bold as to ask your excellency to move over a little for this gentleman ?
1	nastasya filippovna occupied a not very large but indeed magnificently decorated apartment
1	the teacher ’ s widow urged him to come in and sit down , which the prince did
1	he added suddenly , looking at her
1	sonya came into the drawing room with an alarmed face
1	well , then prince andrei answers himself , i do not know what will happen then , i do not want to know and i ca not know ; but if i want this , want glory , want to be known to people , want to be loved by them , it 's not my fault that i want it , that it 's the only thing i want , the only thing i live for
1	the merest peasant hires himself out to work – yet his bondage is not total ; besides , he knows there 's a term to it
1	i got angry owing to the conclusion that , if i had already resolved to kill myself that night , it followed that now more than ever everything in the world should make no difference to me
1	le duc ! —and the well-fed convoy had no sooner passed than a carriage rumbled by , drawn by gray horses in tandem
1	i left t— at the beginning of september , on the twelfth of september ; i remember it well
1	surely i must also have told you then about the document ?
1	in his ignorance of the matter , he exaggerated it , as happens to many , and therefore began to consider it his right to be unceremonious in the highest degree
1	the general , the colonel , and even the major had their uniforms completely unbuttoned , so that their noble silk suspenders showed slightly , while the gentlemen officers , observing due respect , remained buttoned up except for the bottom three buttons
1	human reason asks , what was the cause of this movement , or according to what laws did it occur ?
1	she glanced haughtily at the prince
1	you heard , no doubt , avdotya romanovna , when you were with them the story of the servant philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago , before the abolition of serfdom
1	i , for instance , simply ca not live without spare cash
1	well , how 's your father ?
1	it contained half a line , in a very british hand and of a very spartan brevity : thank you , be easy
1	individual goodness will always abide , because it is a personal need , a living need for the direct influence of one person on another
1	there was , however , not a word in it about marriage , but generals , colonels , and even court dignitaries kept flitting through the story , with zverkov among them and all but at their head
1	most ungainly , said the colonel , absolutely nothing good about it
1	yes , indeed , sir , he is of more weight than i am
1	olga ivanovna worriedly anticipated blood poisoning and prayed to god at night , but nothing bad happened
1	what did i know ?
1	and you know , lambert , she loves him !
1	who has forbidden you ?
1	he turned everything over to the last threads and rags , and mistrusting himself , went through his search three times
1	now i know you personally , i am convinced of it
1	as soon as he had said this again , the same familiar sensation froze his heart
1	in his memoir chekhov with us , written not long after chekhov 's death in , kornei chukovsky called this now-famous letter a gauntlet flung in the face of an
1	my grandfather was married to a household serf , a singer from a neighboring landowner 's private serf theater
1	i fancy i shall have to see him more than once again , he said to dounia
1	however , the underground man is hardly a typical rational egoist , any more than he had been a typical romantic
1	he asked , addressing his sister
1	it 's shameful to go out in such a coat
1	the first to meet the guests was mlle bourienne
1	i am a student , and allow no one to shout at me
1	they began to play the newly fashionable mazurka
1	and you will see , vasin added , that it did not come into his head for nothing ; he has a very keen eye in that regard
1	one of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying close to the wheels
1	stop gambling , dear , i beseech you mama , too liza , i know it myself , but
1	but just then an adjutant came in and reported something to davout
1	they took no notice of raskolnikov 's coming in ; they were talking
1	the mason looked at pierre attentively and smiled , as a rich man , holding millions in his hands , would smile at a poor man who has said to him that he , the poor man , did not have the five roubles that would make his happiness
1	how could i have given it to her ?
1	when a ship goes in one direction , there is one and the same swirl at its bow ; when it frequently changes direction , the swirl running ahead of it also shifts frequently
1	and for denisov that series of memories evoked by the name bolkonsky was a distant , poetic past , when , after supper and natasha 's singing , not knowing how himself , he had proposed to a fifteen-year-old girl
1	now he had the right to devote his life to them , to serve them anything might happen now !
1	she could not have come through the wall !
1	murat sees that the game is up if the sergeant is allowed to speak
1	koch recognised the jewel‐case and gave the name of the owner , who proved conclusively that it was his
1	he did not understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis , of a new view of life and of his future resurrection
1	it was obvious to the hunters , and to the dogs , and to the wolf himself that it was all over now
1	four of them took him away , i do not know where , to the bastille or the fort-l'évêque ; two stayed with the men in black , who ransacked the place and took all the papers
1	more now , more now !
1	what did svidrigaïlov say to you ?
1	she did not say anything , but glanced around anxiously , as if looking for something
1	nothing about himself nothing !
1	evidently , great names are created so as to live by themselves , apart from their bearers
1	you ca not set out so late on such a long journey !
1	where to get the other forty roubles ?
1	and d'artagnan clinked the rest of the pistoles in his pocket
1	i will leave here tomorrow , get hired as a telegraph girl
1	dounia smiled and held out her hand , but the look of anxiety did not leave her face
1	razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs
1	the angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted
1	listen , rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow
1	allow me to ask what are you alluding to , began the clerk , that is to say , whose about whom did you say just now but i do not care !
1	and you must have spent quite a bit of it by now
1	that is a question for jurisprudence
1	the philosopher became frightened , especially when he noticed that her eyes flashed with some extraordinary light
1	of course , it would be best not to go at all
1	i admit , i was beginning to be a bit worried about you
1	you are an angel , i am not worthy of you , only i am afraid to deceive you
1	so strangely that lukerya suddenly went back ten minutes later to look at her : she was standing by the wall , right by the window , her hand leaning on the wall and her head pressed to it , she was standing like that , thinking
1	'corporal punishment is generally bad , but on certain occasions it is useful and indispensable
1	an occasional sleepy clerk will plod by , briefcase under his arm , if he has to pass nevsky prospect on his way to the office
1	he blushed to his ears and , dropping his glance , wanted to disappear somewhere , but there was decidedly nowhere to disappear to : court chamberlains in brilliant uniforms stood in a solid wall behind him
1	looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep , she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought—bread , salt , a plate , a spoon
1	i will wear lizaveta 's now and give you this
1	well , have you thought of anything , polenka ?
1	the kingdom of heaven and eternal rest to him , says the soldier with his arm in a sling
1	she was silent and seemed embarrassed
1	katya , sleepy and with her braid tangled , plumped up and turned the heavy featherbed for the third time , muttering something
1	he wore a huge ring with a precious stone in it
1	i asked belokurov , walking home with him
1	at these soirées , he experienced a feeling similar to what a conjurer experiences , expecting each time that his trick will be exposed
1	you can see for yourself it 's a gun
1	yes , yes ; i have not taken the loop off the armhole !
1	kindly go back to your posts , gentlemen—all , all of you , he added in a superior 's tone
1	they had now all moved to kolmino , their estate , about twenty miles from petersburg , where they had a roomy mansion
1	will freedom prove as much to our taste ?
1	he overtook the girl at the seat , but , on reaching it , she dropped down on it , in the corner ; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes , apparently in extreme exhaustion
1	at ten o'clock in the evening they were to pick up the lady-in-waiting near the tavrichesky garden ; [ ] yet it was five minutes to ten , and the young ladies were still not dressed
1	buckingham recognized d'artagnan instantly , and suspecting that news was being sent to him of something happening in france , took time the three musketeers enough only to ask where the man was who came bearing it ; and having recognized the uniform of the guards from far off , he set his horse at a gallop and went straight to d'artagnan
1	first of all , i predict to you that you will not attain a certain person …
1	cried the senior officer
1	he was waiting for sonia ; he saw that they were parting , and that sonia was going home
1	and this is not the way to you
1	i want to have another word or two with you
1	the ladies had not put in any lots
1	he liked , for instance , to speak very often about the hermitic life and placed the hermitage incomparably higher than wanderings
1	khoma brut hung his head and gave himself over to reflection
1	they were talking of something with special warmth
1	pierre 's confusion had now almost vanished ; but along with that he felt that all his former freedom had also vanished
1	the prince noticed that aglaya suddenly left her place and came over to the table
1	second line have you written that ?
1	i ’ d throw out all those people from yesterday and keep him , that ’ s what kind of man he is ! …
1	you see , alexei ivanovich , it 's only a week that i
1	the three musketeers he 's considering by what sort of execution he will have me die , d'artagnan said to himself
1	he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes , but this was not easy
1	that morning natasha had told him that she had refused bolkonsky
1	' i found them on the pavement
1	well , on my word of honor , that ’ s just what i do think about , especially as i ’ m falling asleep , laughed the prince , only it ’ s not napoleon i crush but the austrians
1	mama , she whispered to her , not pausing for a second
1	if man has not become more bloodthirsty from civilization , at any rate he has certainly become bloodthirsty in a worse , a viler way than formerly
1	and perhaps she really did not have a kopeck
1	since you have taken such a step , you must harden your heart
1	do not question him too much about anything if you see him frown ; do not ask him too much about his health ; he does not like that
1	god , how beautiful my birthplace is !
1	i must admit , he went on calmly , that such cases certainly must arise
1	i trust our acquaintance , he said , addressing raskolnikov , may , upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware , become closer
1	he felt , so to speak , renewed ; again the struggle , so a means of escape had come
1	god keep your majesty till then !
1	it will be useless
1	and the germans were the first he attacked
1	it 's a sin to say it , and god punishes that sort of talk
1	of course you do
1	however , i am sure you again think i am laughing
1	and do not forget , dear heart , to tell the master that i know there are good fish to be had on his farmstead , especially sturgeon , which he can send whenever there 's a chance : at the markets here it 's expensive and no good
1	it was the most boring time of the day
1	it 's not a province , your excellency , but a district
1	do you hear , do you hear ?
1	he did not hear what varenka said , nor did he see anything
1	they are at their country house now
1	cried buckingham , pouring all his thought and all his love into the question
1	bagration stopped and , without replying , tried to make out rostov 's face in the mist
1	cried the chairman himself , the general , in an all but offended voice
1	is it true that moscou is called moscou la sainte ?
1	but how could she not know ?
1	for my part , my much-esteemed prince , though i used to be honored by your trustfulness towards me in a certain point , which is known to you , sir , but only to a certain degree , and by no means further than the circumstances that essentially concern that same point … i realize it and am not complaining in the least
1	eh bien , qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
1	i beg you , i implore you on my knees : let me die , and my last sigh will be a blessing on my savior
1	again the sleigh is driving , again vanka laughs , and foolish akulka has opened her coat and shows her legs : look , good people , my boots are not like vanka 's , they are new
1	it ’ s as if you ’ ve appropriated me , the way you keep me under lock and key , the prince protested
1	he added suddenly , looking at her
1	an involuntary chill ran down his spine
1	what did he do there ?
1	and once i was at home , strong , cheerful , loved
1	i do not know why they wo not come , ivan ivanovich said , as if not listening to ivan nikiforovich
1	i am bringing you , and that 's enough
1	the three musketeers so you insist on pursuing this thesis ?
1	as the bishop was getting into his carriage to go home , the whole moonlit garden was filled with the merry , beautiful ringing of the expensive , heavy bells
1	how could the officers lead their troops to a battlefield they considered impossible ?
1	he asks you to come at once on very important business
1	but there was something very strange in him ; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intelligence , but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness
1	it was impossible to make out the words , only the voices could be heard : two tenors and a bass
1	oh , let me look like a paltry little brat to her , who spied on her and plotted a conspiracy , but let her recognize that i conquered myself and placed her happiness higher than anything in the world !
1	she took the uncle 's guitar and at once found the chords for the song
1	sire , i beg you
1	returning home at seven o'clock , he did not find pavel pavlovich there , which first caused him great surprise , then wrath , and then even despondency ; finally , he began to be afraid
1	in short , i hid , and barely had time to jump there as they came in
1	do you at least know how to load a pistol ?
1	but i looked upon you as the sun , liza , and how could anything have occurred to me ?
1	time passes quickly when it comes to attack and defense
1	i only have ten days , and as of tonight two will have gone by
1	cried sonia weakly , and she stood rooted to the spot
1	i will go and deliver the letter to the sovereign myself : so much the worse for drubetskoy , who drove me to it
1	so it means that nastasya filippovna invited you to her place straight off ?
1	he quietly opened the door and saw natasha in her violet dress , which she had worn to church , strolling about the room and singing
1	can he really be saved ?
1	looking at things as he did , he took the news of his being sent to voronezh to remount the division not only with no regret at not taking part in the coming fight , but with the greatest satisfaction , which he did not conceal , and which his comrades understood perfectly well
1	i ’ ll have to see what it is and consult with someone
1	he had married young , while still a second-year student , and now his wife seemed half again his age
1	at the table were his mother , the old mrs below who lived with her , his wife , his three children , the governess , the tutor , his nephew with his tutor , sonya , denisov , natasha , her three children , their governess , and old mikhail ivanych , the prince 's architect , who was living in retirement at bald hills
1	he pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle
1	i remember nikolenka , too , i do , she said
1	a bloody razor lay on the floor
1	outside it was clear , fresh , dewy , and cheerful
1	it 's merely the accepted thing to say it 's boring here
1	i am surprised that mama could say it to me
1	vi : his majesty king louis the thirteenth at once , if you please
1	let 's strip and get naked !
1	i told them everything , i didn ’ t hide anything from them
1	i am never going to drink
1	listen , do you like music ?
1	but i was not put out , i did not even stir , and again in the same calm voice declared to her directly that from then on i was depriving her of her participation in my concerns
1	the three musketeers yes , lovely lady !
1	i also saw him in the theater once , in the third circle , now wearing aiguillettes
1	excuse me , excuse me , gentlemen , but again you haven ’ t understood me !
1	but i can go and warn m de la porte , said d'artagnan
1	unquestionably , i am counting most of all on your influence , arkady makarovich ; you love him so much and who else loves him except you and i ?
1	but why did not you tell me , dronushka ?
1	nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him
1	if you can imagine it , i , too , had an appointment at the green bench today
1	why do not you stay home , anisim , the old man said , you would be priceless in the business !
1	milord , cried the queen , you forget that i have never told you i loved you
1	louis xiv was a very proud and presumptuous man ; he had such-and-such mistresses and such-and-such ministers , and he ruled france badly
1	my comrades will also laugh at me do not you want to take them , maybe you will eat them ?
1	something groaned deeply , the groaning went across the field into the forest
1	he could turn directly to the chief clerk with his story , necessarily taking him as an acquaintance and even a close one , and pseldonymov meanwhile could simply keep silent and tremble with awe
1	at last i was left alone in my study
1	the guests talked , moved chairs
1	prince andrei felt sad and downhearted
1	later he also dropped that and went abroad again , this time for a long period , for several years
1	how thin you are !
1	the very word 'trial '
1	you are forgetting that beautiful handkerchief embroidered with a coat of arms
1	to be sure , i myself have just made up all these words of yours
1	he shouted from the window
1	while kutuzov , a man who , from the beginning to the end of his activity in , from borodino to vilno , while always being true to himself in all his acts and words , shows an example uncommon in history of self-denial and awareness in the present of the future significance of the event—kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pathetic , and when they speak of kutuzov and the year twelve , it is as if they are always slightly embarrassed
1	you would better say straight out what you want !
1	the staff captain repeated , as if beginning to call him by his title on account of his acknowledgment
1	and i do not blame her for it , no , i do not blame her !
1	the innkeeper came down from the upper room , apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow and sat down at a little distance , yawning lazily , but with dignity
1	the young officer was very tipsy , and the lady , in all probability an older relative , would not let him go , surely for fear he would rush straight to the buffet for a drink
1	what do you mean , imbecile ?
1	what are you thinking ?
1	they were all looking at him in perplexity
1	as the wheels of the carriage rumbled softly over the straw spread under the windows , anna mikhailovna , turning to her companion with words of comfort , discovered that he was asleep in the corner of the carriage , and woke him up
1	this bothered the doctor and interfered with his thinking and concentration
1	she said , to change the subject , studying his hand , on which there was a signet ring with the head of laocoön
1	yes , rooms a disgusting place—filthy , stinking and , what 's more , of doubtful character
1	raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor
1	i ca not offer you coffee here ; but why not spend five minutes with a friend ?
1	between each kind of troops was a sort of street
1	and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit—eleven roubles , fifty copecks , i ca not guess
1	in the hall there was a group of generals in gold-embroidered uniforms
1	but why the devil did not anybody wake me up ?
1	even with tatyana pavlovna there are certain things i keep silent about
1	you , uncle , spread a greatcoat under him , he turned to his favorite soldier
1	i was not able to intercede for her , but only felt a longing , when i saw her sadness , to draw her to me and pity her in the tone of an old nanny : my dear little orphan !
1	if we give her time to catch her breath , she will have me killed by the lackeys
1	just then the watchmen in the yard began striking two : derr
1	and their job is on the same staircase as the murder , on the second floor
1	oh , all right , thank god , i live well
1	we had already reached the front door , and i was still walking behind him
1	had tea with him i doan like him !
1	c'est un fou , un malheureux qui ne savait pas ce qu'il faisait
1	the two armchairs there … what ’ s the matter with them , don ’ t they want to ?
1	she shouted at her brother , ran to a chair , fell on it , and burst into such sobbing that she could not stop for a long time
1	maman was ill for the whole day ; and the next day alexandra and papa told me i didn ’ t understand what i was babbling myself and what kind of words i ’ d spoken
1	that was the question
1	mme bonacieux went on , seeing that she was regaining some influence over her husband
1	but he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture , too , she added with dignity
1	it seems to me that it 's nothing of the sort
1	velchaninov spat and again began pacing the room , still quicker than before
1	she woke up , listened to what was happening behind the door , and , hearing his groaning , said to herself with a sigh that everything was still the same
1	dessales wrote a letter to the governor for princess marya , she signed it , and this letter was given to alpatych with orders to deliver it to the governor and , in case of danger , to return as soon as possible
1	and how did the thing come about , eh ?
1	lord , who ’ d have thought it ?
1	at least many people have explained their impression that way , and there are many whom the sight of a man in a falling fit fills with a decided and unbearable terror , which even has something mystical in it
1	the old countess sat with a happily sad smile and tears in her eyes , shaking her head from time to time
1	that smile pyotr petrovitch noticed , and at once set it down against his young friend 's account
1	the gist of it was that he made me a proposition to acquaint him with mr dergachev , since you do go there !
1	falling in with the line of carriages , its wheels squeaking slowly over the snow , the rostovs ' carriage drove up to the theater
1	it seemed quite a singular thing to me , a princess living on the rue aux ours
1	the witnesses must have come back
1	i myself arranged for my own ruin , she thought
1	ah , cried anne d'autriche , leave off these vague attacks , sire
1	i ca not forget that
1	the sun had just gone down and the warmth of the day was still in the air
1	do not be uneasy , rodion romanovitch , if i were working for my own advantage , i would not have spoken out so directly
1	or when he calls out his last words to his mother : dear mother , save your poor son !
1	in the first place i decided to be polite and candid with everybody ; no one can ask more of me
1	the beggar hesitated for a moment , but on seeing the silver piece shining in the darkness , he made up his mind and went ahead of athos
1	it may be a coarse satisfaction , but still a satisfaction
1	who would have dreamed of his going out , indeed ?
1	with him were the chief of the imperial staff , the quartermaster general prince volkonsky , generals , imperial adjutants , diplomatic officials , and a large number of foreigners , but there was no army staff
1	wait for it ; no one is going to intercede for you
1	luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm
1	but the deacon 's real apprehensions were of another sort : he feared still more that his better half might find out , who even without that had turned his thick braid into a very thin one with her terrible hand
1	what are they about ?
1	glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop , he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven
1	she had long been wishing to get married
1	one after another , and sometimes two together , pressed up against the high backs of the chairs by the pushing crowd behind , the orators spoke
1	craftsmen and labor-loving artisans !
1	seeing his father 's insistent demand , prince andrei , reluctantly at first , but then with more and more animation , and inadvertently switching from russian to french , out of habit , in the middle of his discourse , began to explain the plan of operations for the proposed campaign
1	they sat side by side , both mournful and dejected , as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore
1	as if on purpose , the nag crawled on for an unnaturally long time , though i had promised a whole rouble
1	i only wanted to say how constantly i have been afraid for you here almost all this time
1	zherkov touched his horse with his spurs ; it shifted its footing three times excitedly , not knowing which leg to start with , worked it out , and galloped off , going ahead of the company and catching up with the coach , also in time with the song
1	in that sense i take after andrei petrovich
1	suddenly on the lower floor , under the balcony , a violin started playing and two tender women 's voices began to sing
1	and there 's no one to ask , he said softly and seriously
1	though very often you are somehow strange , yet you sometimes became so animated that you were always able to say an apt word , and you were interested in precisely what interested me
1	oksana had not yet turned seventeen , but already in almost all the world , on this side of dikanka and on the other , the talk was of nothing but her
1	before going to bed , she had already commented upon , analyzed , turned over on all sides , examined from every angle the words , steps , gestures , signs , and even the silence of her jailers , and from this profound , skillful , and learned study it resulted that felton was , all things considered , the more vulnerable of her two persecutors
1	the old man became insecure , began noticing something in everyone 's eyes
1	uncle pierre you no if papa were alive he would agree with you ?
1	on reaching the seminary , the whole crowd settled by classes in low-ceilinged but rather spacious rooms with small windows , wide doors , and dirty desks
1	so it is , stepan varlamovich !
1	he went over to prince vassily
1	but anyhow , god willing , all will be well , she concluded each time
1	kuzka 's hat had disappeared
1	evidently this was the watchman banging out eleven o'clock
1	i remember them holding a special council for several days ; davout used to come in the morning and in the evening , and often they even argued ; in the end , it seemed that napoleon began to agree
1	i followed him inside ; everything there seemed as before , but i noticed a strange disorder in it all , some tangible absence of something or other ; in short , i sensed in myself those strange feelings that come over us when for the first time we enter the dwelling of a widower whom we had known before inseparable from his lifelong companion
1	i sneeze on your head , ivan ivanovich !
1	sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket , untied a corner of it , took out the ten‐rouble note and gave it to luzhin
1	all through the journey , he experienced the joy of a schoolboy on vacation
1	supposing that the failure of the petersburg plan for the berezina would be attributed to him , they expressed their dissatisfaction with him , their contempt for him and mockery of him more and more strongly
1	but again you will ask a question : why did i not save her from evildoing ?
1	mr jackson , he said to him , you will go at once to the lord chancellor and tell him that i entrust him with the carrying out of these orders
1	i will get in !
1	yes , look , he 's for certain what is this ?
1	it 's curious , tatyana pavlovna , ever since childhood i have loved nuts , you know , the simplest kinds
1	anna andreevna 's escapade seemed to me too resolute , even cynical : despite my refusal to assist her , she , as if not believing me a whit , was sending me straight to lambert
1	so , sonya , here you were saying all kinds of stupid things about him , natasha began in a meek voice , the sort of voice in which children speak when they want to be praised
1	the squadron commander , captain denisov , known to the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov , was assigned the best quarters in the village
1	man needs , not six feet of earth , not a country place , but the whole earth , the whole of nature , where he can express at liberty all the properties and particularities of his free spirit
1	hesitation over which plan of all those proposed was to be accepted increased still more after the emperor 's one-month stay at headquarters
1	and what am i to have so much ambition ?
1	sonia said this as though in despair , wringing her hands in excitement and distress
1	here , of course , he was also speaking of our university men
1	tomorrow maybe everything will be over for me , all these memories will be no more , all these memories will simply have no more sense for me
1	and on the millennium of russia , he counted seven hundred people
1	are not you ashamed now , sister ?
1	found in any of these external events , not even the break in his career caused by ten years of prison and exile
1	were you kept very busy then by your service to the … emperor ?
1	let it be , natasha
1	he will come in that day and he will ask : 'where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross , consumptive step‐mother and for the little children of another ?
1	she added after a pause
1	they got into the carriage and rode for several minutes in silence
1	at the beginning of the battle , they merely stood on the way to moscow , shielding it , and they went on standing in the same way at the end of the battle as they had at the beginning
1	he was convinced , to his horror , that he was sure to hear ambiguous whispers behind his back , to see ambiguous faces , to reap the most malignant smiles
1	here it is , the decisive moment has come !
1	one , taking off his shako , carefully undid and redid the gathers ; another , crumbling some dry clay between his palms , polished his bayonet ; a third worked the leather and readjusted the buckle of his bandolier ; yet another carefully spread out his footcloth , wound it up again , and put his boot back on
1	everyone has his plans , raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently
1	he was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eyes
1	ptitsyn explained , mainly addressing ivan fyodorovich , that the prince ’ s aunt , whom he had never known personally , had died five months ago
1	but what can i tell you ?
1	the cares of moving , worry about her brother , organizing life in a new home , new faces , her nephew 's upbringing—all this stifled in princess marya 's soul that feeling of temptation , as it were , which had tormented her during the illness and after the death of her father , and especially after meeting rostov
1	whether the prince wants it , whether anna andreevna wants it , whether the old prince wants it
1	denis yawns and makes a cross over his mouth
1	i am describing and want to describe others , and not myself , and if i keep turning up all the time , that is a sad mistake , because i simply ca not avoid it , however much i wish to
1	in short , hecuba is nothing to him
1	and he had hardly thought it when , somewhere near , a clock on the wall , ticking away hurriedly , struck three
1	the commander in chief gave a sign for the men to go on marching freely , and his face and all the faces of his suite expressed pleasure at the sounds of the song , at the sight of the dancing soldier and the merrily and briskly marching soldiers
1	here choub rubbed his back and set out in the other direction
1	there 's an obvious misunderstanding here , like it or not
1	how nice it is to look at you today
1	whether it 's very comforting or something—i do not know , sir ; but it must be for the sake of pleasant memories
1	vasin was working temporarily in a joint-stock company , and i knew that he brought work home
1	all at once the creak of a door swinging on its hinges made me start
1	as they were driving up , prince andrei , smiling , drew pierre 's attention to the bustling that was going on by the back porch
1	but that same evening and the next day , reports came in one after another about unheard-of losses , about the loss of half the army , and a new battle turned out to be physically impossible
1	but evidently the french officer was more inclined to the thought that he had been taken prisoner , because pierre 's strong hand , moved by involuntary fear , squeezed his throat more and more tightly
1	natasha said with a happy and frightened face
1	on the march from vyazma to tsarevo-zaimishche , napoleon rode on his bob-tailed light bay ambler , accompanied by his guards , bodyguard , pages , and adjutants
1	how did it happen that the russian army , which , weaker in numbers than the french , gave battle at borodino , how did it happen that this army , surrounding the french on three sides and having the aim of capturing them , failed to do so ?
1	what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg ?
1	who is asking for me ?
1	i held out with fifteen thousand men for more than thirty-five hours and beat them ; but he did not want to stay even fourteen hours
1	in that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants
1	then , i remember , i maintain in my article that all well , legislators and leaders of men , such as lycurgus , solon , mahomet , napoleon , and so on , were all without exception criminals , from the very fact that , making a new law , they transgressed the ancient one , handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people , and they did not stop short at bloodshed either , if that bloodshed—often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law—were of use to their cause
1	but today i decided not to think about it
1	however , i thought to myself then , as i was going to bed , it turns out that he gave his 'nobleman 's word ' to marry mama in case she was left a widow
1	and listen , my dear : i believe god brought you to petersburg from switzerland precisely for me
1	what an ardent man you are , he muttered with some especially nasty smile
1	and to think of who—of what nonentities—can be the cause of people 's unhappiness !
1	olga ivanovna had always called her husband , as she did all the men she knew , not by his first but by his last name
1	it was somehow unnatural that these two eyes had only decided precisely now to begin peering at me
1	but i precisely wanted to ask you whether , as an acquaintance , you might not get me into nastasya filippovna ’ s this evening ?
1	said mistress katerina to the old serving woman who was wiping the wooden bowls
1	well , that makes it opportune that i did not and do not invite you
1	never mind , come on
1	they came to the high priest , he went on , jesus was questioned , and the servants meanwhile made a fire in the courtyard , because it was cold , and they warmed themselves
1	there , beyond this field , and the tree , and the roof lit by the sun ?
1	these were russians : bagration , ermolov , who was at the beginning of his rise , and others
1	everyone was talking , shouting , exclaiming ; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating : what a misfortune !
1	do not touch me , unheard-of sinner , go quickly !
1	according to his observations the patient 's illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months , but it had partly also a moral origin , was , so to speak , the product of several material and moral influences , anxieties , apprehensions , troubles , certain ideas and so on
1	as for the money , you need it to go carousing , right ?
1	after the resolute refusal he had received , petya went to his room and , locking himself in , wept bitterly
1	from all that he writes , you should rejoice and not cry
1	when i got up to lock the door after him , i suddenly remembered the picture i had seen that day at rogozhin ’ s , in one of the gloomiest rooms of his house , above the door
1	they say the sun gives life to the universe
1	just then two women and a man in a white hat appeared on the road from the manor house , walking towards the officers
1	judge how grateful i must be to marfa petrovna for having repeated to avdotya romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me
1	yes , that 's how it would be if any other general walked in , but not i
1	an enormous crowd of factory workers , servants , and muzhiks , mixed with clerks , seminarians , and noblemen , went out to the three hills early in the morning of that day
1	and why do you want to know , why do you want to know so much , since they have not begun to worry you ?
1	will you never kiss me from the heart , as a child , as a son kisses his father ?
1	to him it was all completely the same at that moment who was standing over him or what he said about him ; he was only glad that people had stopped over him and only wished that those people would help him and bring him back to life , which seemed so beautiful to him , because he now understood it so differently
1	but no , it ca not be , he thought
1	what does this mean ?
1	how could it happen that in the course of more than twenty years he had not known and had not wanted to know it ?
1	eight days later , she had seduced the jailer 's son and escaped
1	as if he doesn ’ t know !
1	milady went on , do you still suffer from your wounds ?
1	you see well ach , damn it !
1	here ’ s your wretched little hat , let ’ s go !
1	gloomy , disgruntled , he sat down like a wet rooster on his tattered couch , not knowing himself what to undertake , what to do , and finally recalled the whole of his dream
1	in the house on the left he saw some open windows ; on the window‐sills were pots of sickly‐looking geraniums
1	i must tell you , i once had a cockroach sitting in my left ear
1	but raskolnikov , who had expected something quite different , gazed blankly and dreamily at him , making no reply , as though he heard the name of pyotr petrovitch for the first time
1	he turned very pale
1	the thing was that about a week earlier he had managed to win some twelve thousand in one evening , and he was triumphant
1	please do not think it too familiar here , on the sofa
1	how can i tell whether they have a farthing ?
1	on december , the eve of the new year , for le réveillon , [ ] a ball was given by a grand dignitary of catherine 's time
1	but wanting is very often , and even for the most part , completely and stubbornly at odds with reason , and
1	why is it , or can it be my fancy ?
1	fourth , it was senseless to wish to take prisoner the emperor , the kings , the dukes—people whose capture would have hampered the actions of the russians in the highest degree , as was recognized by the most skillful diplomats of that time ( joseph de maistre and others )
1	so what if it 's broken ?
1	ivan ivanovich went up to the gates and clanked the latch : inside , the barking of dogs arose ; but the motley pack soon ran off wagging their tails , seeing that the face was a familiar one
1	i received a letter from him , she replied
1	why such a profusion of churches ?
1	and all that he said—for instance , that they should wait for provisions , that the men had no boots—all that was so simple , while all that they proposed was so complex and clever , that it was obvious to them that he was old and stupid , and they , though not in authority , were commanders of genius
1	indeed , the reader will notice that in the third paragraph the crystal edifice ceases all at once to represent the ideas of the narrator 's opponents and becomes instead something that he himself has possibly invented as a result of certain old nonrational habits of our generation , something , he says , that exists in my desires , or , better , exists as long as my desires exist
1	don ’ t you believe he ’ s capable now of killing a dozen souls ?
1	that is why the superior is proposing this subject , which has never been treated before , and in which i acknowledge there is material for magnificent development : utraque manus in bene-dicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est
1	surrounded by shouting children , the mummers , covering their faces and altering their voices , bowed before the hostess and took their places in the room
1	about fifteen years ago a gentleman was sent here from russia
1	i will die , waiting a year : it 's impossible , it 's terrible !
1	needles of ice reached over the puddles , and the forest became inhospitable , forsaken , desolate
1	he decided that he would go the next day and leave her a letter in which he would announce his intention to part with her forever
1	when we quarrelled , i usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object , it influenced her , it pleased her , indeed
1	you gave us everything yesterday , sonia said suddenly , in reply , in a loud rapid whisper ; and again she looked down in confusion
1	he added that it was perhaps because of anton the wretch that he had come to the estate then—and he added it extremely seriously
1	once he stood still and counted his money ; he found he had thirty copecks
1	you lecture for a quarter , a half hour , and then you notice that the students have started looking up at the ceiling , at pyotr ignatievich , one feels for his handkerchief , another tries to settle more comfortably , a third smiles at his own thoughts
1	she quickly jumped up , but with extraordinary strength i held her back by both hands
1	his life in prison had been very sad , i assure you , but certainly worth more than a kopeck
1	how are you , ivan nikiforovich ?
1	nothing will happen to him , mama , nothing will ever happen to him , and nothing can , he 's that kind of man !
1	i think you are tight , she said , shivering from the night 's dampness
1	well , that 's the whole story
1	that 's all conventional , that 's all relative , merely a way of looking at it , he thought in a flash , but only on the top surface of his mind , while he was shuddering all over , there , i have got it on !
1	he opened the door ; the wind burst in at once and blew out my candle
1	the noise grew louder , the horses could not have been more than a hundred and fifty paces away ; if they still could not be seen , it was because of a bend in the road
1	however , i endeavored to calm her down and assured her in gracious words of my benevolence and that i was not at all angry that she sometimes polished my boots poorly
1	andrei yefimych became embarrassed and kissed the icon , while mikhail averyanych pursed his lips and , nodding his head , prayed in a whisper , tears coming to his eyes again
1	kutuzov fell back towards vienna , destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn ( in braunau ) and traun ( in linz )
1	i will give you the brown sow , the one i fattened in the pen
1	your wife the devil
1	not only were none of them there , but i even had difficulty finding our room
1	'future mover , but i do not understand a thing
1	i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me
1	he said in the same voice
1	anatole , as shinshin rightly said of him , had driven all the moscow ladies out of their minds ever since his arrival , especially by neglecting them and apparently preferring gypsy women and french actresses , with the foremost of whom , mlle george , he was said to be in intimate relations
1	athos took the letter from d'artagnan 's hands , brought it to the lamp , and set fire to it , and did not let go of it until it was reduced to ashes
1	he also did not appear even once in general epanchin ’ s house , so that the general , too , had to hire another clerk
1	this merchant had been stuck at the station for two days already , drinking and squandering money , surrounded by all sorts of comradery , and kept being late for the train to continue his journey
1	there is a stench of pickled cabbage , charred wicks , bedbugs , and ammonia ,
1	dessales said something about vitebsk
1	varvara ardalionovna spread her arms
1	it 's my mistress you love , you just told me so
1	i know that you can cause me considerable unpleasantness , she said , as if warding off his words , but i have come not so much to persuade you not to persecute me , as to see you yourself
1	in 'society ' there is only 'society ' and nothing more ; katerina nikolaevna ( his daughter ) is a brilliant woman , and i am proud of it , but she often offends me , my dear , very , very often well , and these girls ( elles sont charmantes ) and their mothers , who come on birthdays— they only bring their embroidery , but they do not know how to say anything
1	as he came through the main gate to the street , the wind blew open the cloak he was wrapped in , though it was the month of august , and tore at his hat , which the traveler grasped with his hand just as it was about to leave his head and pulled down sharply over his eyes
1	in her eyes this marriage to makar ivanovich had long been a decided thing , and she found all that happened to her then excellent and the very best ; she went to the altar with the calmest air possible on such an occasion , so that tatyana pavlovna herself called her a fish then
1	what are you thanking me for ?
1	the tears flowed still more abundantly from the countess 's eyes
1	everyone in the house understood the old woman 's condition , though no one ever spoke of it , and everyone made every possible effort to satisfy her needs
1	vasin was extremely polite and amiable , but it was somehow hard for me to see him going to such trouble on my account
1	i ’ ll bring it to you right now …
1	impossible , said milady , you are so valiant a man and so keen a sword
1	i am not beating you !
1	our right flank was disposed on a rather steep elevation , which dominated the positions of the french
1	he felt convinced that svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth
1	here there is no doubt that timidity and a total lack of personal initiative have always been regarded among us as the chiefest and best sign of the practical man—and are so regarded even now
1	the young priest was sentenced to branding and ten years in irons
1	why do not you turn to them , if you need support ?
1	pierre was precisely the husband necessary for this brilliant society woman
1	with a most noble air and even with feeling , he offered her his hand
1	when at the last ball at the marshal 's princess bezzemelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father and i were married , polenka—she asked at once 'is not that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking‐up ?
1	i cried in frenzy
1	stebelkov , he went on , sometimes trusts all too much in his practical sense , and because of that rushes to a conclusion in accordance with his logic , which is often quite perspicacious ; yet the event may in fact have a much more fantastic and unexpected coloration , considering the characters involved
1	the servant who opened the door for the prince led him without announcing him and led him a long way ; they passed through one reception hall with faux-marbre walls , an oak parquet floor , and furniture from the twenties , crude and heavy , passed through some tiny rooms , turning and zigzagging , going up two or three steps and then down the same number , and finally knocked at some door
1	why such pride all of a sudden , sir ?
1	just think that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe , and consider that what you are about to do , you are doing for him
1	stand on your feet , the soldier with the sling says softly
1	what was her indignation , her anger , when she learned that they wanted to put on her nuptial bed a man sick with something like cholerine !
1	and you stay a minute
1	yes , a seasoned one , your excellency , replied danilo , hastily doffing his hat
1	luzhin stood still , waiting with a defiant and offended face
1	she turned pale when she saw her father-in-law
1	he reached that goal by his persistent accusations
1	but this is what the french call bonne guerre , and the most innocent form of deception !
1	the house with the mezzanine : an artist 's
1	his father and mother were also most lawless people , and both were unimaginable drunkards
1	maybe my dear one is weakening now—and i lie here !
1	i promised you i would come , said felton , and i have come
1	rostov felt himself perfectly happy
1	well , now , mr khoma , it 's time we went to the deceased , said the gray-haired cossack , turning to the philosopher , and the four of them , spirid and dorosh included , went to the church , swinging their knouts at the dogs , of which there were a great many and which angrily bit at their sticks
1	only the girlfriends , sir !
1	marmeladov was in the last agony ; he did not take his eyes off the face of katerina ivanovna , who was bending over him again
1	send for gavrila ardalionovich at once !
1	the person wanted to say something
1	he raised his head
1	he went to tver , to see the widow of iosif alexeevich , who had long ago promised to give him the deceased 's papers
1	do you know , my dear young one , he began again , as if continuing his former speech , do you know that there 's a limit to the memory of a man on this earth ?
1	when they were clean , he took out the axe , washed the blade and spent a long time , about three minutes , washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap
1	having cut the loaf in two , he looked into the middle and , to his surprise , saw something white
1	i stopped short on the spot
1	well , now it ’ s quite enough !
1	but that 's the whole trick , that it 's simple , and it did not occur to you fools !
1	in the past year , by tatyana pavlovna 's observation , he had gone very much to seed in his dress ; his clothes were always decent , but old and without refinement
1	here i am , suppose , going in : they are amazed , interrupt their dancing , stare wildly , back away
1	you are shameless , tatyana pavlovna , you have always despised me
1	the more diverting his letters were , the more vexed she felt
1	so i still have my diamond ?
1	and i suppose you know who i am ?
1	he asked , going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant , consisting of several rooms , which were , however , rather empty
1	she began , trying squeamishly and vexedly to recall
1	i thank you all !
1	prince andrei wondered , looking at them
1	take my word for it , kutuzov said , becoming animated and beating his chest , they will eat horseflesh for me !
1	he was an elderly , imposing man , who occupied himself part of the time with tailoring
1	the two tall muzhiks were having their say
1	i went to the cemetery along with the others ; they snubbed me and put on airs
1	there were not so many people there , he would be less observed , and it would be more convenient in every way , above all it was further off
1	at the torzhok posting station there were no horses , or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him
1	catch them it 's for your sakes i she stumbled as she ran and fell down
1	everybody laughs and knows that it 's to get money from me—can you imagine
1	this power can not be the direct power of physical domination of a strong being over a weak , a domination based on the application or threat of the application of physical force , like the power of hercules ; nor can it be based on the domination of moral force , as some historians think in the simplicity of their hearts , when they say that historical figures are heroes , that is , men endowed with a special force of soul and mind which is called genius
1	i had proposed , in concert with dumas , to draw an important work from the first volume of the memoirs of d'artagnan
1	it was not like that at all , it was quite different
1	natasha said in a whisper
1	his face wore a look of genuine sympathy
1	she cried , seeing raskolnikov and rushing up to him
1	he was not thinking about anything
1	you behaved as befits a man who cherishes his honor ; perhaps too hastily , but we wo not discuss that
1	this son of mars stopped us at the most interesting place , it seems
1	unobservant and unsuspecting as the prince was , he had been worried by the thought that nastasya filippovna might venture upon some scandal in order to drive aglaya out of pavlovsk
1	it may be that you have completely forgotten me now
1	the three musketeers you are right , my dear m bonacieux , my friends and i went on a little journey
1	she exclaimed in fear , quickly pulling her hand away
1	we are philosophizing , said natasha , glancing at him for a moment , and continuing the conversation
1	he was in that degree of vexation in which the most restrained people sometimes start saying unnecessary things
1	that is why i ask it , and not out of depravity
1	only on horseback and in the mazurka did denisov 's small stature not show , and he looked like the fine fellow he felt himself to be
1	sighed bazin , i know , monsieur , everything is turned upside down in the world today
1	oh , i did anticipate how trivial all the objections would be , and how trivial i myself would be , explaining the idea : well , what have i said ?
1	and natasha got up on tiptoe and walked out of the room as ballet dancers do , but smiling as only happy fifteen-year-old girls do
1	in fact , it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire
1	i think , i think for a long time , and ca not think up anything else
1	despite all , i embraced mama tenderly and asked at once about him
1	later anisim and the old man had tea and a bite to eat , while varvara fingered the new roubles and asked about local people who were living in town
1	the mere influences of climate mean so much
1	not in the slightest , and indeed it 's an absurdity !
1	lebedev , who had already settled down , suddenly got up , seized the candles , and moved them closer to ippolit , so that there would be enough light to read by
1	i asked after you and came straight up
1	but later on he got used to it
1	a couple of words about him : he began his career as a fortuneless petty clerk , quietly endured the drag for forty-five years on end , knew very well how far he would be promoted , could not bear having stars in his eyes , though he was already wearing two of them , and particularly disliked expressing his own personal opinion on any subject whatsoever
1	the great point is that everything now is going to be different , is going to be broken in two , he cried , suddenly returning to his dejection
1	that was what his sudden idea consisted in
1	you promised to prove it
1	varya suddenly cried out , trembling with wrath
1	i was going to ask if you had any news of them
1	as an honest man , i must warn you , anna andreevna , that your expectations concerning me may prove vain in the highest degree i expect you to stand up for me , she looked at me firmly , for me , who am abandoned by everyone your sister , if you want that , arkady makarovich !
1	make ten bows and go
1	for some reason he imagined the next day as fatal and
1	all the horrors of the reign of terror [ ] were based only on concern for public tranquillity
1	you can make inquiries
1	how trivial it all must be , what i am fretting about now !
1	but can that be true ?
1	sasha helped her into the cab , and covered her legs with a plaid
1	i am from gascony , it 's true , and since you know that , i need not tell you that gascons are not very forbearing ; so that , when they have excused themselves once , even for some stupidity , they are convinced that they have already done half more than they ought
1	velchaninov chose a certain romance by glinka , which almost no one knows anymore : when you do ope your merry lips , my love and coo to me more sweetly than a dove
1	but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal
1	why are you blushing ?
1	why not dolokhov answered distractedly , peering into the face of the french drummer boy
1	pierre looked around with bloodshot eyes and did not reply
1	stay , i will tell of you to‐day
1	occasionally , amidst the monotonous waves of soldiers , like a spray of white foam on the waves of the enns , an officer pushed his way through , in a cape , with his physiognomy distinct from the soldiers ' ; occasionally , like a chip of wood swirled along by the river , a dismounted hussar , an orderly , or a local inhabitant was borne across the bridge by the waves of infantry ; occasionally , like a log floating down the river , a company 's or an officer 's cart floated across the bridge , surrounded on all sides , loaded to the top , and covered with leather
1	i tell katya about my past and , to my great
1	ah , you are a dear , ah , you are so kind !
1	when anyone drops a button or a spoon , he quickly jumps from his bed and picks it up
1	i am at your service
1	why are you glad that evgeny pavlych will come ?
1	his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice , stressing each syllable : it is by my orders and for the good of the state that the bearer of this present has done what he has done
1	il leur faut une victime [ ] occurred to him as he looked at the tall fellow swinging his arm
1	sonya , darling—it 's all like before
1	have the right to kill ?
1	he took them and immediately settled down to copying them
1	it sometimes seemed to him that they were all rejoicing as he was , and only tried to conceal their joy , pretending to be occupied with other interests
1	pierre looked at her through his spectacles
1	no , i don ’ t think so
1	now i beg your special attention : consider : if he had now succeeded in proving that sofya semyonovna was a thief , he would have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions , that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with sofya semyonovna , that , in attacking me , he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister , his betrothed
1	we will go at once
1	pierre sat for so long that evening that princess marya and natasha kept glancing at each other , obviously waiting for him to go
1	when , on the first day , having gotten up early in the morning , he went out of the shed at dawn and saw the at first dark cupolas and crosses of the novode-vichye convent , saw the frosty dew on the dusty grass , saw the heights of the sparrow hills , and the wooded bank meandering along the river and disappearing into the purple distance , when he sensed the touch of the fresh air and heard the noise of jackdaws flying across the field from moscow , and when the light then suddenly sprayed from the east and the rim of the sun floated majestically from behind a cloud , and the cupolas , and the crosses , and the dew , and the distance , and the river , everything began to play in the joyful light—pierre felt a new , never yet experienced feeling of the joy and strength of life
1	when it comes to that , i will need stout fellows from the city and the country
1	anna mikhailovna asked a girl who walked past them with a carafe on a tray ( calling her dear and sweetheart ) about the princesses ' health , and drew pierre further down the stone corridor
1	neither our laughter nor our jokes were the least bit spiteful or jeering , we were simply merry
1	by her husband , who was a lord of your acquaintance , d'artagnan went on , looking fixedly at athos
1	but this notion had no sooner flashed in everyone at once , than they all immediately insisted at once that they had perceived the whole thing long ago , and it had all been clearly foreseen ; that it had all been clear since the poor knight , and even before , only then they had not wanted to believe in such an absurdity
1	it almost never happened with her that she would sit like that , without work
1	anyhow , brother , my legs wo not hold me up , and it 's stifling here
1	captain , said felton , here is the person i spoke to you about , who is to be taken to france safe and sound
1	though there was certainly some purpose in this impudent pestering , this advertising of an acquaintance and an intimacy that did not exist , and there could now be no doubt of it—evgeny pavlovich had thought first to get rid of her somehow or other , and did his best to ignore the offender
1	here , of course , there 's a special view his own disposition of ideas undoubtedly , i interrupted warmly
1	the general heaved his shoulders
1	there were two or three dishes obviously in addition to what was usually served , rather sophisticated ones , and one of them something altogether unfamiliar , so that no one could even put a name to it
1	d'artagnan told him how he had found porthos in bed with a sprain , and aramis at a table between two theologians
1	the sting of indignation pierced my heart , and in a single instant i made a tremendous decision
1	the thing is this , my dear sit down and listen to me
1	carriage stopped at a house newly painted gray ; there was a front garden with dust-covered lilacs , and a strong smell of paint on the yellow porch
1	your excellency , they have come from the department of records , from the director , for instructions from the consistory , from the senate , from the university , from the foundling hospital , the auxiliary bishop has sent
1	i simply turned and here you are
1	milady asked in surprise
1	you leave me alone too , for goodness ' sake !
1	i feel as if everything is looking at me and listening in on how i am going to die
1	everything is about to begin over again
1	princess marya did not finish listening and , continuing with the thread of her thoughts , turned to her sister-in-law , her gentle eyes indicating her stomach
1	two doctors—one was pale and trembling— were silently doing something to the man 's other leg , which was red
1	eight years passed and he was recalled to russia , and now he was installed as an auxiliary bishop , and the past had all withdrawn somewhere into the distance , the mist , as if it had been a dream
1	out of his mind ?
1	it contained my fortune
1	you are my aunt 's son , and consequently my cousin ; you come from noyon in picardy ; you have several court cases in paris and no procureur
1	here , nastasya , take it please , he said , fumbling in his pocket ( for he had slept in his clothes ) and taking out a handful of coppers—run and buy me a loaf
1	god willing , he will get himself established somewhere in time
1	in short , i will omit the details , but from all this later came a very complex and vile piece of gossip
1	razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings
1	god forbid he should be a human being and come to love or pity someone , or start thinking about what is just and what is not
1	she hardly ever went anywhere
1	i read it almost trembling with excitement
1	give me a dumpling , a big ring of sausage , a bowl full of porridge !
1	she looked at him with unutterable reproach , tried to say something , but could not speak and broke into bitter , bitter sobs , hiding her face in her hands
1	yes … yes , i should have … but she would have died !
1	it was already night when they entered port
1	they felt that they could not express what they understood in words
1	voyons , à quoi pensez-vous ?
1	varvara danced , while the old man just waved the handkerchief and shifted from one heel to the other , but those who were hanging over each other there in the yard , peeking through the windows , were delighted and for a moment forgave him everything—his wealth and his offenses
1	lebedev ended up with what he wanted
1	velchaninov suddenly burst into nervous and irritated laughter
1	god knows what concerns and plans you may have , or what ideas you are hatching ; so it 's not for me to keep nudging your elbow , asking you what you are thinking about ?
1	he controlled himself and , as if with a certain strain , began
1	the council of war , at which prince andrei had not managed to speak out his opinion as he had hoped to , left in him a vague and disturbing impression
1	no , khalyava , we ca not , he said
1	tell me , porfiry petrovitch , tell me once for all and make haste !
1	lebedev , who happened to be near by , came closer with his curious little eyes and gazed at the envelope , trying to guess what it was about
1	her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her ; everyone laughed and—i like your public , even the cancan public—they laughed and shouted , 'serves her right—serves her right !
1	i only learned that the marriage , which only failed to take place through the girl 's death , was not at all to praskovya pavlovna 's liking
1	he could not recall the face of the speaker , and even now he did not recognise it , but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer
1	but what am i to do ?
1	it made no difference whether everything was left or only half
1	the king cut through the crowd and , without a mask , the ribbons of his doublet barely tied , approached the queen and said to her in an altered voice : madame , if you please , why are you not wearing your diamond pendants , when you know it would have given me pleasure to see them ?
1	do you know what sort of man that suits ?
1	i also knew perfectly well , even then , that i was monstrously exaggerating all these facts ; but there was nothing to be done : i could no longer control myself , i was shaking with fever
1	felton was leaning on a chair , and milady saw with devilish joy that he would perhaps lose strength before the end of the story
1	and when they start fooling and pulling tricks
1	something may turn up even today , this same evening , ganya smiled to the general
1	lord de winter took an armchair , drew it to her side , and sat down by her
1	and what are we doing now ?
1	it is a great misfortune that i have experienced , my much-esteemed prince , yesterday evening or today at dawn … i hesitate to specify the exact time
1	he called to her across the room
1	and among external sensations the only one possible for me was reading
1	all this was spoken with a special sort of pride—we all know how such things are said
1	would you take it upon yourself , prince , to deliver it to aglaya ivanovna , right now , but only to aglaya ivanovna , that is , so that nobody sees—understand ?
1	yes , dead , he 's dead smeared with something
1	in that case , if you wish , i ’ m done , that is , i am forced to convey only briefly those facts which , in my conviction , it would not be superfluous to know in all their fullness , he added , noticing a general movement that looked like impatience
1	i ’ ll make a little list for you of which books you should read first ; want me to , or not ?
1	full-stock , half-stock , she laughed , pippin , rennet , borovinka , budding , grafting
1	you are general pervoedov ?
1	i am an old man , i have been teaching for thirty years , but i do not see any paltriness or lack of ideals , nor do i find it worse now than before
1	i hated my face , for example , found it odious , and even suspected that there was some mean expression in it , and therefore every time i came to work i made a painful effort to carry myself as independently as possible , so as not to be suspected of meanness , and to express as much nobility as possible with my facelet it not be a beautiful face , i thought , but , to make up for that , let it be a noble , an expressive , and , above all , an extremely intelligent one
1	'play me for him ?
1	say what you want
1	some hussars galloped up to him , freed his foot , and sat him in the saddle
1	everything went as mme bonacieux had foretold
1	why am i so uneasy at having put in that ' i believe ' ?
1	i will get on top it wo not matter before the officer finished , the orderly came up to the count with the same request for his master
1	it was growing light
1	now everything he said came out as charmant
1	after five o'clock it was only at the dam of augesd that the hot cannon fire of the french alone could be heard , from numerous batteries lined up on the slopes of the pratzen heights and firing at our retreating troops
1	the prince listened to this with eyes shining with rapture and tenderness
1	on top of this rubbish , always with a pipe in his mouth , lies the caretaker nikita , an old retired soldier with faded tabs
1	my mother has just said it is like a tomb
1	as for felton , he 's hesitating
1	they engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes—what a thing to trust to a casual stranger !
1	entering a small corridor with two doors on each side of it , velchaninov met a very fat and tall woman , disheveled in a homey way , and asked her about pavel pavlovich
1	and even in my oblivion there had still constantly remained some point , as it were , in my memory that simply refused to be forgotten , around which my drowsy reveries turned heavily
1	mind your woman 's business !
1	it happens to everybody , his son said in a careless , brazen tone , while in his soul he considered himself a villain , a scoundrel , whose whole life would not be enough to redeem his crime
1	yes , prince , we meet here under such sad circumstances well , how is our dear patient ?
1	i must have said too much , brother
1	i got the clothes before
1	and last evening he came back
1	however , having calmed himself by deciding to confess it to the priest the next week and to start that same day making fifty bows a day for a whole year , he peeked into the cottage ; but no one was home
1	( directive from barclay de tolly to the civil governor of smolensk , baron asch ,
1	the three musketeers the king , quite joyful , inquired whether the cardinal was still in the louvre
1	said one of the cossacks , getting up on the box along with the coachman , who had a rag wrapped around his head instead of his hat , which he had already left in the tavern
1	so let it be a dream , let it be , but this life , which you extol so much , i wanted to extinguish by suicide , while my dream , my dream—oh , it proclaimed to me a new , great , renewed , strong life !
1	so it 's a sword stroke that 's keeping him in bed ?
1	( pierre responded affirmatively by inclining his head )
1	then he took the hook and softly , noiselessly , fixed it in the catch
1	when i was there he behaved well to the servants , and they were actually fond of him , though they certainly did blame him for philip 's death
1	i do not understand what makes your sister love me ; but , of course , without her maybe i would not be living in the world now
1	mlle bourienne said he asked about you as soon as she began to speak of it , her lips trembled and tears began to fall
1	—i would not have been able to answer , because everything became clouded in me
1	the balloon was not ready yet , but , as pierre learned , it was being constructed at the wish of the sovereign
1	that is , since i now have such a crazy look ?
1	she forgot all her fear of her father , went up to him , took him by the hand , pulled him to her , and embraced his dry , sinewy neck
1	it ’ s not what you think , but i ’ m very surprised at your extreme assurance …
1	this but suddenly occurs often in stories
1	nothing bad has happened to the queen ?
1	then , too , that you wanted to avoid thanks and that , as the saying is , your right hand should not know
1	i have the feeling that once upon a time i lived at home with a real family , but now i am the dinner guest of someone who is not my real wife and am looking at someone who is not the real liza
1	i do not even understand how he dared
1	lambert went on still more irritably
1	during this interruption , pierre noticed that prince vassily came from behind the back of his chair and with that same look which showed that he knew what he was doing , and so much the worse for the others if they did not understand him , did not go up to the sick man , but passing by him , joined the eldest princess and together with her made for the depths of the bedroom , to the high bed under the silk canopy
1	when , having bought a kaftan ( only with the aim of participating in the people 's defense of moscow ) , pierre had met the rostovs , and natasha had said to him , you are staying ?
1	he 's sworn to injure me as long as i live
1	with the hundred pistoles , we will feast till the end of the month
1	after that , of course , everything 's over !
1	weep , said athos , weep , heart filled with love , youth , and life !
1	i asked , with tender curiosity
1	there will be a game of proverbs this evening , one girlfriend , whom he had scarcely noticed till then and had not yet exchanged a word with , whispered confidentially to velchaninov , and this evening everybody will laugh at pavel pavlo-vich , so you must , too
1	scrambling into the wagon , they drove off , urging their horses on and singing a song , the words and meaning of which could hardly be made out
1	oh , yes ; polenka , that is the little girl
1	for god 's sake , go and look at liza
1	you should teach us
1	sighed nevyrazimov , looking down the street , where human shadows flitted one after another past the lighted lamps
1	he took offense at shinshin 's words
1	you should have said , you know about the letter , why are you pretending ?
1	there 's a dull pain in my cheek—the tic is beginning
1	lord de winter asked coldly
1	meanwhile people were crowding to the grille
1	later on , with her husband ’ s increasing wealth and significance in the service , she even began to feel somewhat at home in this high circle
1	it will be an answer to your first question indeed , for the woman was your sister
1	wait , i will tell you i ca not
1	the old prince , not abandoning his order , went to his rooms after dinner
1	do me a favor , count , allow me for god 's sake to take refuge somewhere on one of your carts
1	svidrigaïlov treated katia and the organ‐grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks
1	it was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind , at least
1	believe me , sonya , i have come to you now as to an angel , and not at all as to an enemy : what sort of enemy , what sort of enemy are you to me !
1	madame schoss and sonya , who had not undressed yet , went with him
1	and he began to explain the reasons why he could not bear his daughter 's muddleheaded character
1	though you have made me marvel all day today !
1	he felt as if he were tumbling down a mountain , falling , falling , falling , that he must hold on , get a grip on something , but there was no opportunity for that
1	on the first landing , this pillar turned out to have a depression in it , like a niche , no more than one pace wide and a half-pace deep
1	the monitors , as they heard the lessons , looked with one eye under the desk , where a roll or dumpling or pumpkin seeds stuck out of their subordinate 's pocket
1	this general was ivan fyodorovich ’ s immediate superior in the service , whom he , from the fervor of his grateful heart and even from a sort of self-love , also considered his benefactor , while he by no means considered himself ivan fyodorovich ’ s benefactor , treated him with perfect equanimity , though he liked to take advantage of his manifold services , and would at once have replaced him with some other official , if certain considerations , even of a not very lofty sort , demanded it
1	they are holding me prisoner
1	well , then , i want you to hear about me every day !
1	she went about just as we do , only she did not eat pork , said it was somehow forbidden by their law
1	lizaveta prokofyevna went straight in the opposite direction from the one they took every day
1	she frightened us last night , i ca not get over it
1	i did not understand— what are 'geneva ideas ' ?
1	but where and when shall i see you again ?
1	pulcheria alexandrovna was surprised to find that she , too , was glad : she had only that morning thought rupture with luzhin a terrible misfortune
1	she says goodness knows what she says , she does not explain her object !
1	voices whispered to lazarev , who did not know where to go
1	en général ils regardent smolensk comme le point où ils doivent se refaire
1	i do not know what to say
1	said porthos , drawing out his lips in disdain
1	on the contrary , i constantly reproach myself ; but that is a quite uninteresting and cheerless subject
1	of all that napoleon might have done : to winter in moscow , to go against petersburg , to go against nizhni novgorod , to go back more to the north , or to the south the way kutuzov went later— whatever one thinks up , nothing stupider or more destructive than what napoleon did , that is , to stay in moscow until october , to allow his troops to loot the city , then , hesitating whether or not to leave a garrison , to quit moscow , to approach kutuzov without starting a battle , to turn to the right , reach maly yaroslavets , again without trying his chances of breaking through , to go , not by the road kutuzov had taken , but back to mozhaisk down the devastated smolensk road—nothing stupider than that , or more destructive for his troops , could possibly have been thought up , as the consequences showed
1	that is , i ’ d like to know to what extent …
1	how she spat in ganka ’ s mug !
1	it 's all that cuckoo 's fault !
1	she talks a lot , likes to argue , and accompanies every phrase , even the most insignificant , with expressive looks and gestures
1	allons doucement , il faut la surprendre , [ ]
1	someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within , and seemed to have her ear to the door he moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding , then rang a third time , but quietly , soberly , and without impatience , recalling it afterwards , that moment stood out in his mind vividly , distinctly , for ever ; he could not make out how he had had such cunning , for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body
1	he asked her about mutual acquaintances : the princess became still more animated and started talking away , giving the prince greetings and town gossip
1	as for m de tréville , when the king 's eyes rested a moment on him , he endured that gaze with such firmness that it was the king who looked away ; after which , grumbling all the while , the king went to his apartments
1	having loaded the guest with all this pharmacy , she would lead him to a multitude of plates
1	tatyana pavlovna looked at her with decided indignation
1	i ’ ll leave presently , you may be sure
1	two roubles forty-three kopecks !
1	raskolnikov pulled away his hand
1	your excellency , dearest , replied alpatych , instantly recognizing the voice of his young prince
1	he did not have tea in the morning , did not go to the hospital , and spent the whole time lying on the turkish divan in his study
1	then , shifting his eyes from milady to the paper , he read : order to convey to_____ the name of the place is left blank , de winter broke off
1	the general was coming down , pink and fresh after his bath
1	sonya , listening , thought of what an enormous difference there was between her and her friend , and how impossible it would be for her to be ever so slightly as bewitching as her cousin
1	how disgusting , he thought with annoyance
1	pipe in his teeth , he lay looking at them all with extraordinarily sweet eyes and kept spitting to the side
1	yes , that should be so , thought pierre , when , after these words , the rhetor went away again , leaving him to his solitary reflections
1	in fact , it does happen that a deeply sleeping man suddenly opens his eyes , even raises his head for a second and looks around the room , and then , after a moment , unconsciously lays his head back on the pillow and falls asleep , remembering nothing
1	at that moment the dog ran in , barking ; i wanted to seize her , but she , vile thing , almost seized me by the nose with her teeth
1	still less did he think of doing people harm in order to profit from it
1	i earnestly beg it
1	and the more lifelike the image , the more perplexing the question
1	an arm , osip nikiforovich !
1	once , about a month ago , we were all laughing together after dinner and , as usual , suggesting a subject for adelaida ivanovna ’ s future painting
1	that ’ s jealousy for you
1	she would open her big eyes , listen , look , and keep silent
1	and , taking him under the arm , with a happy face she slowly walked beside him to the sitting room
1	these words about a father from a son had most certainly confirmed in her all her suspicions about versilov and about his having insulted her
1	one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloody apron and with small , bloody hands , in one of which , between the thumb and the little finger ( so as not to stain it ) , he was holding a cigar
1	then porthos and aramis instantly closed ranks with him , while jussac lined up his soldiers
1	ah , yes , your business
1	you ca not imagine how we felt !
1	that is our whole mistake , that we ’ re still unable to see that this is not only an exclusively theological matter !
1	she said , and tears , bitter , abundant tears , poured from her big eyes
1	from whom would i have borne such a look and such an insolent smile without an immediate protest , even the stupidest—it makes no difference—on my part ?
1	with horror it was told how many books they had read
1	to milord the duke of buckingham , london
1	but can it be that he was received in my mother 's house ?
1	as soon as the dinner was over , the two former friends left their places and began looking for their hats , so as to slip away
1	that means it was her i saw in church !
1	you ’ re a terrible skeptic , prince , kolya added after a couple of minutes
1	on his way , alpatych met and passed baggage trains and troops
1	their fathers and relations all got angry with me , because the children finally couldn ’ t do without me and kept gathering around me , and the schoolmaster finally even became my worst enemy
1	the accident was as follows
1	sit , sit a while , must be your legs do not stand firm yet , he invited me affably , pointing to the place next to him and continuing to look into my face with the same radiant gaze
1	the past is banal and uninteresting , the future insignificant , and this wondrous night , unique in their life , will soon end , will merge with eternity—why then live ?
1	pavel pavlovich hastily waved his hand
1	no , i wo not get my nose smashed
1	we must try to imagine what would have transformed the chicken coop into a mansion , what would have made it more than a phalanstery in a brothel , what would have turned it from an embodiment of the laws of nature into a contradiction of those very laws , and how from all this the need of faith and christ was deduced
1	do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that i too oh , my dear sir how could i ?
1	yes , yes , please , or it will get late , he said , and , nodding his head , lowered it and again closed his eye
1	just come , if you need something , the staff can always be helpful said zherkov
1	here suddenly , while i was standing and coming to my senses—suddenly my revolver flashed before me , ready , loaded—but i instantly pushed it away from me !
1	the best thing in your situation would be to run away from here
1	prince andrei , in a cloak , astride a black horse , was standing behind the crowd and looking at alpatych
1	but they only flash ; and what ’ s needed is a full embodiment , which always comes about unexpectedly and suddenly , but it is impossible to calculate precisely when it will come about ; then , once you have received the full image in your heart , you can set about its artistic realization
1	ah , so he ’ s kept his word , just look !
1	what business is she of yours , my good sir ?
1	after petya joined obolensky 's cossack regiment and left for belaya tserkov , where the regiment was being formed , the countess was overcome with fear
1	maybe ferdyshchenko won ’ t take you , nastasya filippovna , i ’ m a candid man , ferdyshchenko interrupted , but the prince will !
1	my familiarity with the natural sciences and the scientific method has always kept me on my guard ; i have tried wherever possible to take scientific data into account , and where it has not been possible i have preferred not writing at all ( letter of october , )
1	the bishop listened to his mother and remembered how , many years ago , she used to take him and his brothers and sisters to visit relatives whom she considered wealthy ; she was solicitous for her children then , and for her grandchildren now , and so she had brought katya
1	in it the unforgettable nikolai semyonovich , as requested , gives his reflections on arkady 's notes - that is , on dostoevsky 's novel , minus the epilogue
1	soon , however , the same thing that used to happen in exclusively nighttime hours began to repeat itself in the mornings , but with greater bile than at night , with anger instead of repentance , with mockery instead of tenderheartedness
1	i am hungry as a dog
1	milady held out her hand to him
1	in one place he stopped , listening
1	she only felt a gentle hand firmly take hold of her hand , and barely touched the white forehead with beautiful , pomaded blond hair above it
1	perhaps , to‐day even but never mind to‐morrow evening i shall take him for a walk , said razumihin
1	the prince and lebedev decided not to tell anyone , even kolya doesn ’ t know
1	the bracelet was taken out and handed around ; but they all looked at it silently , and some even mockingly
1	dreadful cries , weeping and howling , were coming from behind the neighbors ' door
1	the one i have chartered for you
1	before , too , when he came home , he had often forgotten to lock the door for the night , considering it a matter of no importance
1	there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes ; he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud
1	in the midst of the conversation going on in the sitting room , dimmler came in and went to the harp that stood in the corner
1	we all know what 's evil for us
1	don ’ t interrupt me , we ’ re not such fools as you think , mister lawyer , lebedev ’ s nephew exclaimed with spiteful vexation
1	when they prayed for those who hate us , she invented enemies and those who hated her in order to pray for them
1	he did not know how long he was unconscious
1	the noise behind the door increased , and suddenly the door was opened a little
1	are you dreaming , athos ?
1	and it was at this work that the arrival of his lady acquaintances found him
1	alas , you see it yourself !
1	some built little houses from the clods of the field or plaited little baskets out of straw
1	so what if he 's a kammerjunker
1	it 's either for you or for me
1	if there is still a mimicry of traditional storytelling in a number of the earlier ukrainian tales , in others we see much more clearly this shift to a process of objectless intent , to speech about nothing —particularly in ivan fyodorovich shponka and his aunt , the last written of the evenings , and in old world landowners and the story of how ivan ivanovich quarreled with ivan nikiforovich from mirgorod
1	but that is all folly !
1	but maybe indeed i grew angry all at once and drove him out because of the sudden guess that he had come to me hoping to find out whether any more of andronikov 's letters had been left to marya ivanovna ?
1	this reply was too flattering for me to insist on his departure
1	three months later olenka was returning from church one day , sad , in deep mourning
1	the images it produces are too deeply ambiguous to bear any social message
1	the cardinal listened , smiling , to this brilliant display of master bonacieux 's enthusiastic feelings ; then , when bonacieux 's cries were lost in the distance , he said : good
1	the mother was still lying in bed opposite the door , and to her right stood the godfather , a most excellent man , ivan ivanovich yeroshkin , who served as a chief clerk in the senate , and the godmother , the wife of a police officer , a woman of rare virtue , arina semyonovna belobriushkova
1	what could i have against you , the only just , good , and compassionate being i have met !
1	at the very beginning of the trial raskolnikov 's mother fell ill dounia and razumihin found it possible to get her out of petersburg during the trial
1	dounia said this , speaking hurriedly , and for an instant the colour rushed to her face
1	the unexpected news of the french crossing the niémen was particularly unexpected after a month of unfulfilled expectation , and that at a ball !
1	this is not m
1	i confess , it came to me suddenly in a flash of lightning
1	she positively pounced upon him , and made him sit on her left hand ( amalia ivanovna was on her right )
1	i wish you wouldn ’ t come to see us all day tomorrow , but come in the evening , when these … guests have gathered
1	keller insisted later that ippolit had kept that hand in his right pocket before as well , while he was talking with the prince and clutching at his shoulder and collar with his left hand , and this right hand in the pocket , keller insisted , had supposedly aroused a first suspicion in him
1	if you don ’ t drop these loathsome people at once , i ’ ll hate you alone all my life , all my life !
1	it 's you i am calling !
1	i had to wait : the next train came through at eleven o'clock at night
1	everybody got up , began to move , to talk , again the dressmakers came , again marya dmitrievna came out , and tea was served
1	in their church there are also representatives who are worthy of all respect and vir-tu-ous men …
1	the days were busy in tsybukin 's house
1	but why , he was always asking himself , why had such an important , such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market ( where he had moreover no reason to go ) at the very hour , the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny ?
1	come , my dear porthos !
1	the monotonous , cold , eternally tidied and , so to speak , buttoned-up faces of the officials , military and civil , did not offer much space for the brush : it began to forget luxurious draperies , strong gestures and passions
1	well , let me tell you that i have no feeling of love now , not the slightest , so that i wonder myself indeed , for i really did feel something through idleness and depravity , raskolnikov put in
1	i never saw such terrible fits of inner suffering , such furious , scorching anguish , such devouring despair as shook the unfortunate lover
1	there is the temperature of boiling water , and there is the temperature of red-hot iron
1	i know that porthos was well on his way , said d'artagnan , and , as for aramis , to tell the truth , i was never seriously worried about him
1	and my eyes have only now been opened !
1	but his excellency tried this time not to hear
1	then the dark avenue of firs , the collapsed fence in the field where rye was flowering then and quail were calling , cows and hobbled horses now wandered
1	suddenly a sense of happiness came over him
1	well , and such men are most often good souls
1	give me their books , give me their tracts , their memoirs , and i undertake , without being a literary critic , to write a most persuasive literary critique , in which i shall make it clear as day that every page of their books , pamphlets , and memoirs has been written first of all by a former russian landowner
1	anyway i could not bring myself to it !
1	this meant that tikhon had not handed him the waistcoat he wanted
1	it 's quite simple , replied athos
1	and if you were suddenly slapped with paralysis or , say , some brazen fool , taking advantage of his position and rank , insulted you publicly , and you knew he would go unpunished—well , then you would understand how it is to fob others off with comprehension and the true blessing
1	riding behind one of the lines of the infantry guard regiments , he heard a voice call him by name
1	i know you have , he answered
1	now he had been sitting for half an hour , an hour , and he was sick of it to the point of anguish
1	do put down your cap , it looks as if you were just going , it makes me uncomfortable i am so delighted raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of porfiry petrovitch
1	d'artagnan was going to make some observations about that , but athos placed his hand on his shoulder , smiling , and d'artagnan understood that it was fine for a little gascon gentleman like him to haggle , but not for a man who had the airs of a prince
1	the three musketeers and with a slow , accusatory gesture , the baron pointed to milady 's left shoulder , which he almost touched with his finger
1	a péché véniel or a péché mortel ?
1	katia drank off her glass of wine , as women do , without putting it down , in twenty gulps , took the note and kissed svidrigaïlov 's hand , which he allowed quite seriously
1	the beekeeper opens two central frames so as to see into the nest
1	believe me , i am happy to see you
1	i must observe , lebedev interrupted him with feverish impatience and in a sort of creeping voice , while the laughter spread more and more , that i corrected only the first half of the article , but since we disagreed in the middle and quarreled over an idea , i left the second half of the article uncorrected , sir , so all that ’ s illiterate there ( and it is illiterate ! )
1	and you murdered her !
1	osip , it ca not be !
1	some columns halted , stacked their muskets , and lay down on the cold ground , assuming they had gotten where they were supposed to go ; some columns ( the majority ) marched all night and obviously did not get where they were supposed to go
1	xxxv : at night all cats are gray d'artagnan , as usual , appeared at milady 's towards nine o'clock
1	katya says with vexation
1	and you won ’ t have tea and won ’ t eat dinner again ?
1	they were led up to the porch and brought into the house one by one
1	i bet you never thought of that
1	you got me into it , and kniff cheated
1	the droshky finally pulled up , and kovalev , breathless , ran into a small reception room , where a gray-haired clerk in an old tailcoat and spectacles sat at a table , holding a pen in his teeth and counting the copper money brought to him
1	suddenly she covers her face with her hands
1	petya , having left his family on their departure from moscow , had joined his regiment , and soon after that was attached as an orderly to a general in command of a large detachment
1	go , or you ca not even imagine what will happen !
1	athos walked off in the direction indicated and reached the outskirts at the opposite end of town from the one by which he and his friends had entered
1	how can a throne be vacant ?
1	pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her
1	please go in , it 's so hot here my shirt 's soaking wet
1	but i ran out of the apartment , not leaving her a word of hope
1	there was something heavy , strained , unspoken , quarrelsome ; everyone scowled
1	within a year ivan dmitrich was completely forgotten in town , and his books , which the landlady dumped into a sleigh in the shed , were pilfered by street boys
1	pavel pavlovich narrowed his eyes pleasantly
1	all this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction
1	then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole : but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen
1	someone called her name in a tender and soft voice from the garden side and kissed her on the head
1	but that was not all
1	dostoevsky 's response had to take artistic form
1	with this shriek she expressed everything the other hunters had expressed with their simultaneous talk
1	here everything was usually talked about : someone who was having new trousers made for himself
1	grimaud stretched out his hand in the direction of the lys
1	he cried in a voice accustomed to command
1	at this pronouncement from aramis , athos frowned and bit his lips
1	come here , dorosh , till i embrace you !
1	the most immediate result of it was and had to be—for the russians , that we came nearer to the destruction of moscow ( which we feared more than anything in the world ) ; and for the french , that they came nearer to the destruction of their whole army ( which they also feared more than anything in the world )
1	some of them were talking ( he heard russian speech ) , others were eating bread , the most seriously wounded gazed at the courier galloping past them silently , with a meek and sickly childish interest
1	you want to stop at home ?
1	she sat down on a chair , whispering something
1	or at least to be in his own home , on the terrace , but so that nobody else was there , neither lebedev nor his children ; to throw himself on his sofa , bury his face in his pillow , and lie there like that for a day , a night , another day
1	olya even burst out laughing , only so spitefully , and this gentleman , i see , takes her hand , puts it to his heart
1	she ’ s placid as a fool , and really a perfect wet hen , there ’ s no shaking her up , yet she ’ s sad , there are times when she looks so sad
1	when modest alexeich came into her room , without his frock coat , a half hour before going to the ball , in order to put his decoration on his neck in front of her pier glass , he was enchanted by the beauty and splendor of her fresh , airy costume , brushed out his side-whiskers smugly , and said :
1	the hurry the young woman had been in to bring the queen this excellent news of the fortunate return of her messenger had made it so that the two lovers barely exchanged a few words
1	the first thing he saw on riding out into the space occupied by tushin 's cannon was an unharnessed horse with a shattered leg that was whinnying near the harnessed horses
1	he is already of the rank of a counsellor , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , and is distantly related to marfa petrovna , who has been very active in bringing the match about
1	however , i will say all : even to this day i do not know how to judge her ; indeed god alone could see her feelings , and besides , a human being is such a complex machine that in some cases there 's no figuring him out , and all the more so if that being is—a woman
1	nina ivanovna wanted to say something but was unable to utter a word , sobbed , and went to her room
1	i could in no way understand why he did that
1	he still made her uneasy , as though he was competent and good‐natured , was he capable of carrying out his promise ?
1	i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years
1	looking at the cold face of davout , who , like a stern teacher , agreed to be patient for a time and wait for an answer , pierre felt that every second of delay might cost him his life ; but he did not know what to say
1	anyway , perhaps it might be possible to consult him !
1	to conceal as little as possible
1	the idiot is dostoevsky ’ s most autobiographical novel
1	the prince cried in anxiety
1	my reason 's deserting me—simply !
1	each of them retired to his own room
1	saying good-bye , i kissed her for the first time in my life and all that would have been fine , but there was one thing that was not fine : one oppressive idea had been throbbing in me since nightfall and would not leave my mind
1	he stopped to see me on his way ; i was on duty !
1	if he keeps on coming , we fire again
1	the general had promised yesterday to come here and spend the night , but he didn ’ t
1	there 's no room for you here !
1	i wo not let you go like that
1	to the poison she pours out , there is no antidote
1	it – it – it 's
1	she added in surprise
1	her lapdog did not manage to get through the door into the shop and was left in the street
1	if the old woman wept , it was not because he was able to tell it movingly , but because peter was close to her and she was interested with her whole being in what had happened in peter 's soul
1	and how would you like a bit of this ?
1	( ) the names of characters—bolkonsky , drubetskoy , bilibin , kuragin , and others—resemble well-known russian names
1	so he remained on the bench , his back leaning against the wall and his arms hanging down , just where his guards had deposited him
1	you can see for yourself what has happened to semyon zaharovitch ; he is dying
1	don ’ t swear , i won ’ t believe you !
1	he shrugged his shoulders and spread his arms
1	only the expression of the will of a divinity not dependent on time can pertain to a whole series of events that are to take place over several years or centuries , and only a divinity , without cause , by its will alone , can determine the direction of mankind 's movement
1	but all eyes were demanding that he submit
1	when the weather 's gray and overcast , there are no morning frosts
1	of course people like that are always possible
1	the first morning i came back from the office i found katerina ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—soup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never dreamed of till then
1	i said , somewhat agitated , apparently even offendedif you count me , it 's twenty-eight roubles , not twenty-one
1	i have this one , he replied
1	you warm your back and your belly gets cold
1	the prince quickly moved close to him , almost touching him , and made out the pale face of rogozhin
1	what a charming boy !
1	d'artagnan , for all the pains he took , could find out nothing more about his three new friends
1	do you love sister sonia ?
1	he at once raced ahead another stretch , rubbed his horse down with heather and leaves , and placed himself in the middle of the road about two hundred paces from the camp
1	and , to be sure , we avoided talking to him about his sister varenka marrying 'alias the spider
1	i have sworn off it
1	it was a warm , clear day
1	father does not want it , because he wants a more aristocratic and wealthy marriage for andrei
1	then he remembered the sock about which razumihin had just been telling him
1	damnation , these thoughts again !
1	qu'ont-ils fait pour louis xvi , pour la reine , pour madame elisabeth ?
1	and does that keep you from telling me the second reason ?
1	it 's out of my way
1	and when i pictured how the earth is a heavy substance and in sitting down may grind our noses into flour , i was overcome with such anxiety that , putting on my stockings and shoes , i hurried to the state council chamber to order the police not to allow the earth to sit on the moon
1	wo not you have some tea now ?
1	i should think so !
1	besides the velvety baritone laugh and the laugh that resembles a harmonica , the maid who serves us also hears an unpleasant , cracked laughter , like that of a vaudeville general : haw , haw , haw
1	oh , tell me , who first announced , who was the first to proclaim that man does dirty only because he does not know his real interests ; and that were he to be enlightened , were his eyes to be opened to his real , normal interests , man would immediately stop doing dirty , would immediately become good and noble , because , being enlightened and understanding his real profit , he would see his real profit precisely in the good , and it 's common knowledge that no man can act knowingly against his own profit , consequently , out of necessity , so to speak , he would start doing good ?
1	then it would take off , take right off
1	what 's one to do with such children ?
1	of his purity of heart and lack of malice i wo not speak : it 's not for us to get started on that theme to finish with the characterization of makar ivanovich , i shall tell one of his stories from his own private life
1	n'est-ce pas qu'il est admirable—duport ?
1	( ) however much the difficulty of comprehending causes may increase , we will never arrive at the notion of total freedom , that is , the absence of cause
1	and , anyhow , you ’ re clowning and making fun of me in your usual way , to make yourself more interesting
1	porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window
1	i like what you are saying , dmitri prokofitch !
1	in any case , this will be decided very soon
1	looking down over the railing , prince nesvitsky saw the swift , noisy , low waves of the enns , which , merging , rippling , and swirling around the pilings of the bridge , drove on one after the other
1	she is herself before you—she herself here declared just now before everyone that i gave her only ten roubles
1	go along with you !
1	avdotya romanovna , luzhin declared huffily , your words are of too much consequence to me ; i will say more , they are offensive in view of the position i have the honour to occupy in relation to you
1	du hast die schonsten augen madchen , was willst du mehr ?
1	and yet , in all this , the cardinal had still not said a word about the duke of buckingham
1	there is one fact but it 's a long story and there 's no need to discuss it
1	can i raise my arm ?
1	seeing the young master , the older girl , with a frightened look on her face , seized her younger friend by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree , having no time to pick up the spilled green plums
1	and you , ganechka , you ’ ve missed aglaya epanchin ; did you know that ?
1	there is justice in it
1	( i am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much )
1	i hope that you yourself , prince , are progressive enough not to deny that …
1	yes , those moments were the light of my soul
1	an hour and a half later , most of the players looked upon their own game as a joke
1	i did not mean that at all !
1	touchard , with increased importance , replied humanely that he made no distinction among the children , that here they were all his children , and he their father , and that he held me on almost the same footing with princely and senatorial children , and that that should be appreciated , and so on , and so forth
1	the days are almost autumnal , but clear , sometimes so fresh , you hide in the thicket , you wander off into the forest , there 's a smell of leaves do i see something sympathetic in your look , arkady makarovich ?
1	come , i will make peace between you
1	one day he would order his camp bed made up in the gallery , then he would remain on the sofa or the voltaire armchair in the drawing room and doze off without undressing , while , instead of mlle bourienne , the boy petrusha read to him , then he would spend the night in the dining room
1	i repeat out of humaneness : reflect , force yourself to reflect well for at least once in your life
1	it seems his eminence wants to keep someone from getting to england
1	besides , he had a strange preoccupation , which was to believe that the very causes of his sadness aroused the gaiety of strangers
1	i do not want to know , hang it !
1	at last , i saw the lamp rise quietly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling
1	athos remained a musketeer under d'artagnan 's command until , at which time , following a trip to the touraine , he also left the service , under the pretext that he had just come into a small inheritance in rousillon
1	the upshot of it all was that i was the only stupid one , and nobody else
1	indeed so , monsieur , said planchet , and i will leave whenever you like
1	to return to england this very instant , and to inform him right away if the duke leaves london
1	well , that was clear , he said after some thought , so , it ’ s over !
1	and everybody there waxed tearful—she had taught them so well
1	how much do you understand ?
1	what struck him , you see , was that only that subject seemed to interest you ; now it 's clear why it did interest you ; knowing all the circumstances and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness i am a little drunk , brother , only , confound him , he has some idea of his own i tell you , he 's mad on mental diseases
1	i hasten to tell you all about the matter , and though it has been arranged without asking your consent , i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account , for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you
1	the explanation of this strange phenomenon as russian military historians give it—that kutuzov prevented the attack—is groundless , because we know that kutuzov 's will could not keep the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino
1	good evening , he said
1	and apparently she had also made an impression on him , because shortly afterwards an elderly lady with whom she was barely acquainted came to have coffee with her , and had only just sat down at the table when she immediately began talking about pustovalov , what a good , solid man he was , and how any bride would be pleased to marry him
1	i do not understand it
1	now , she happened to be there yesterday at the same time i was , by chance , and i had to show her to her carriage
1	true , afterwards , for the next couple of days , everyone was a bit cross ; ivan petrovich was even offended , but not greatly
1	so you ’ re also a relation ?
1	tatyana cried , trembling all over in a terrible fit of anger , ferocious anger
1	he kept imagining that in revenge for it his hateful neighbor would at the very least set fire to his house
1	be a friend , one little cup !
1	there was a slight smell of vodka in his vicinity ; but his manner was showy , somewhat studied , and with an obvious wish to impress by its dignity
1	whole or in a candlestick ?
1	but in spite of this scornful reflection , he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden : and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room
1	you see , liza – i will speak about myself !
1	i was a wicked official
1	it was dark—they were still riding
1	oh , it 's just a momentary delay , replied aramis
1	everything showed that the master of the house liked to make merry and that the yard often resounded with the noise of feasting
1	there were no ladies , because olga ivanovna considered all ladies , except for actresses and her dressmaker , to be boring
1	now that one can talk to you , i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary , so to speak , fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition : in that case you will be cured , if not , it will go from bad to worse
1	you see , my friend , i have been thinking about you , said prince andrei , when they came to the big room with the pianoforte
1	bagration rode around the ranks that had gone past him and dismounted
1	there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather , full of holes , before which stood an old deal kitchen‐table , unpainted and uncovered
1	it was scarcely the document restrained me
1	is not he thin though !
1	prince andrei talked incessantly and argued now with his father , now with the swiss tutor dessales , and seemed more animated than usual—an animation the moral cause of which pierre knew so well
1	it ’ s clear that we must reject it with contempt and double our respect for evgeny pavlych
1	kutuzov was awarded a maria theresa with large cross , and the whole army received rewards
1	look at the stars , burning away something awful !
1	again in his sleep he remembered the zemstvo agent , dark-haired , pale , in tall , dusty boots , coming up to the accountant 's desk
1	could not see , it 's so dark , brother
1	he had his work on vassilievsky , and came home strictly at certain hours , among others almost always before twelve
1	in his letter i found two gross errors in grammar
1	but i knew for certain that he had acquaintances ; lately he had even renewed many former connections in high society circles , which he had abandoned during that last year ; but it seems he was not especially tempted by them , and many were renewed only officially , while he preferred coming to me
1	their every action , which to them seems willed by themselves , in the historical sense is not willed , but happens in connection with the whole course of history and has been destined from before all ages
1	as a criminal led out to execution knows that he is about to die , yet still looks around and straightens the hat he has put on askew , so moscow involuntarily went on with her usual life , though she knew that the time of her destruction was near , when all the conventions of life , which people were accustomed to obey , would be broken
1	the countess never missed an opportunity to make an insulting or cruel hint to sonya
1	thought petro , and gooseflesh crept over him
1	and how long was the queen out of the room ?
1	he 's a poor man , lonely , timid , and of course it would be a sin to deny him our sympathy
1	there was lika mizinova , with whom he was nearly in love , but then failed to keep a rendezvous while traveling abroad in
1	you mean you and natalia
1	they have a psychology of their own , brother
1	he received bolkonsky drily and coldly , and said with his german accent [ ] that he would report his arrival to the sovereign so as to determine an assignment for him , and meanwhile he invited him to stay with his staff
1	he asked , with a constrained smile
1	but first the reader should learn where the one half would come from
1	the exquisite pair of lavender gloves , real louvain , told the same tale , if only from the fact of his not wearing them , but carrying them in his hand for show
1	before evening , a sergeant of the guards came into the church with two soldiers and announced to pierre that he was pardoned and would now go to the barracks of the prisoners of war
1	my word , he has been going it !
1	rostov did not remember and did not feel how he ran to his place and mounted his horse
1	hm damn it all !
1	they barely understood me when i asked them about eternal life , but they were apparently so convinced of it unconsciously that it did not constitute a question for them
1	look , he 's jumped up and is making his bows , they must be quite starved , poor things
1	in front of the house was a pretty porch with a roof supported by two oak posts—unreliable protection from the sun , which at that season in little russia does not joke but leaves the walker streaming with hot sweat from head to foot
1	i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands do not quite get on with their mothers‐in‐law , and i do not want to be the least bit in anyone 's way , and for my own sake , too , would rather be quite independent , so long as i have a crust of bread of my own , and such children as you and dounia
1	papa and the prince are in petersburg
1	suddenly a man of strange , terrible appearance rushed in
1	where is alexander now , and what is he thinking ?
1	moreover , the room had been furnished to receive a woman , and the most complete coquette could not have formed a desire which , in looking around the room , she did not find already satisfied
1	they are like that , authors , literary men , students , town‐criers pfoo !
1	if so , what did you come for ?
1	at this shout— the gentleman turned , paused for a moment , became flustered , smiled , was about to say something , to do something—for a moment , obviously , was in terrible indecision , and suddenly— turned and ran away without looking back
1	generally , this bloodthirsty soldier , said bilibin , needs to be converted to more humane views
1	but i have spoken truly , it 's the truth
1	there were only three glasses ; the water was so dirty that it was impossible to tell whether the tea was strong or weak , and the samovar only held water enough for six glasses , but the more pleasant it was to receive one 's glass in turn and by seniority from the plump little hands of marya genrikhovna with their short , none-too-clean nails
1	raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently ; his eyebrows did not quiver , his face did not flinch
1	to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt , but also to spare the feelings of marfa petrovna , whose suspicions would have been aroused : and then dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family
1	deux fois le quartier général a été attaqué par des troupes de maraudeurs et le général en chef a été obligé lui-même de demander un bataillon , pour les chasser
1	yes , he used to get his hair pulled pretty often , roared the commissariat clerk again , swallowing another glass of vodka
1	but so long as i live and desire – let my hand wither [ ] if i bring even one little brick for such a tenement house !
1	on the contrary , she was terribly struck , but only till home
1	it may be that he had guessed the whole truth in supposing that the reason he was received was that from the first his presence had become impossible for totsky
1	ah , he 's eating , then he 's not ill , said razumihin
1	he could scarcely breathe
1	thought about his mother
1	ah , my god , but why did you do it ?
1	seems like somebody 's coming down the road
1	perhaps he had daughters growing up like that , looking like ladies and refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness
1	i hesitated before , but now i ’ ve decided for certain : first put me in a coffin and bury me in the earth , then marry off my daughter , that ’ s what i spelled out to ivan fyodorovich today
1	i am afraid of them even now
1	he clearly saw the figure of a red-haired gunner , his shako knocked askew , pulling a swab from one side , while a french soldier pulled it towards him from the other side
1	and the only such concept known to historians is power
1	i will say nothing of the mnishki with sour cream , nor the tripe served with the borscht , nor the turkey with plums and raisins , nor the dish that looked very much like boots soaked in kvass , nor the sauce that was the swan song of an old-style cook—a sauce served all enveloped in a spiritous flame , which greatly amused and ukrainian tales at the same time frightened the ladies
1	you simply want to make me lose my head , to work me up beforehand and so to crush me
1	nikolai turned and looked back
1	well , you are smitten !
1	so , brother , you are throwing a ball for the whole petersburg side ?
1	i never have anything to do with the police !
1	they liked to compose songs about each other and praised each other like children ; these were the most simple songs , but they flowed from the heart and penetrated hearts
1	where will she live here ?
1	i lowered my eyes
1	first , some stationery , do you hear ?
1	raskolnikov asked , as though startled
1	if i step on the ledge below , i reflected further , i can get hold of the top of the gate and climb onto the wall—and nobody will notice , there 's nobody here , silence !
1	his whole company had already crowded into the drawing room
1	the thought of putting something aside from his salary proved a dream
1	can such words come from the lips of a … dead man , with a dried-up heart and talent ?
1	napoleon 's historian thiers , like his other historians , says , trying to justify his hero , that napoleon was lured to the walls of moscow involuntarily
1	what 's he doing here ?
1	spit on your gladly , only you seem to know everything here
1	in the evening , when they all began to disperse after supper , anatole kissed princess marya 's hand
1	he added to himself
1	then , too , when one has walked for a long time , hunger comes ; d'artagnan had noticed that some time ago
1	for the recovery of money due , from the student , the head clerk interfered hurriedly , tearing himself from his papers
1	above you there is the king , and above the king there is god
1	ivan suddenly jumped up from his place and rushed to help him off with his cape
1	if the prince had been alone—that is , without us— i am sure he would have been more dignified and resourceful ; now , though , something peculiarly tremulous in his smile , maybe much too amiable , and some strange distractedness betrayed him
1	not stupidly put , but do not nag
1	( about mirth in our time—that was versilov 's observation , chapter one and i remembered it )
1	well , so you see
1	perhaps you ’ ll still kill me before that … ’ she said it and fell to thinking
1	of course , c'est un parti très brilliant , mais le bonheur , ma chère [ ]
1	then i would take all seven roubles from the drawer , to show him that i had them and had deliberately set them aside , but that i did not , did not , simply did not want to give him his wages , did not want to because that 's how i wanted it , because such was amy will as the master , because he was irreverent , because he was a boor ; but that if he asked reverently , perhaps i would relent and pay him ; otherwise he would have to wait another two weeks , wait three weeks , wait a whole month
1	the day before , the thought had occurred to me that it was versilov there , the more so as he had come to my room soon afterwards , though i knew for certain from their own conversations that versilov had moved somewhere to another apartment during the time of my illness , and spent his nights there
1	you did not spend long with us , she said
1	king stepan made war on the turks
1	he did not remember how long he lay there
1	her face was burning , and to conceal her agitation , she bent low to the table , as if she were nearsighted , pretending to read the newspaper
1	but how do you know ?
1	so you , however , do not consider them capable of receiving a person with the notion that he should die without fail and as soon as possible ?
1	he turned away his eyes , and walked past as though he noticed nothing
1	a minute later the door opened and in came , or , rather , heaved himself , a fat man in a green frock coat
1	well , brother arkashka , now i have learned all i needed to know
1	i was acquainted with these narrow little rooms , hardly filled with furniture , and yet with pretensions to a comfortable look ; here was the inevitable soft sofa from the flea market , which it was dangerous to move , the washstand , and the iron bed behind a screen
1	knight of such-and-such orders
1	they were coming from the setch with papers for the tsaritsa
1	otherwise it may be very , very bad for him , and not by my will ; is that so or not ?
1	the blow fell ; the mare staggered , sank back , tried to pull , but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log
1	the thought of today 's meeting with this woman suddenly brought a flush of shame to my face
1	nothing could be seen yet , only the hoofbeats could be heard coming closer and closer
1	the man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder ; he was a warder ; but nikolay pulled his arm away
1	it 's not exactly that she stammers , but she ca not speak plainly
1	this thought made me drop a book more than once
1	the triumphant englishman did not even bother to shake the dice ; he threw them on the table without looking , so sure he was of victory
1	i was two steps away from you , monsieur , replied the procureuse , but you did not notice me because you only had eyes for that beautiful lady to whom you just offered holy water
1	[ ] in africa a whole series of villainies is committed upon the all-but-unarmed inhabitants
1	it was very dark and empty in the passage , as though everything had been removed ; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight
1	and the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not
1	d'artagnan repeated , squeezing her hand still more strongly
1	strange , too , is their look : is it that the eager sea overflowed its shores in a storm , heaved up its shapeless waves in a whirl , and they , petrified , remained motionless in air ?
1	to the question of what he was doing when they arrested him , pierre answered somewhat tragically that he was carrying a child qu'il avait sauvé des flammes [ ] to her parents
1	how changed you are !
1	when i was making merry at his
1	prince n , evgeny pavlovich , prince shch , the girls—everybody broke off their conversation and listened
1	i want to judge myself and so i do
1	why , you yourself said you do not even wish to see her
1	just as if , along with the portrait , a burden had fallen from his soul
1	i myself confess with all my heart that , to this day , when everything has already passed , i absolutely do not know how or at what to ultimately evaluate this unfortunate man , who set us all such a problem
1	however , the chase was profitable to him in this sense , that as the sweat drenched his forehead , his heart cooled down
1	when the general 's steps died away , andrei khrisanfych looked through the mail and found a letter addressed to him
1	kovrin was glad and very adroitly started a conversation with yegor semyonych and tanya about something that would interest the monk ; the black visitor listened and nodded affably , and yegor semyonych and tanya also listened and smiled cheerfully , not suspecting that kovrin was not talking to them but to his hallucination
1	the german tutor tried to memorize all the kinds of dishes , desserts , and wines , in order to describe everything in detail in his letter to his family in germany , and was quite offended that the butler with the napkin-wrapped bottle bypassed him
1	let me worship you like this all my life i do not know , i do not remember—and suddenly she began sobbing and shaking ; a terrible fit of hysterics came
1	all that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria , and with his morbid exceptional vanity !
1	i just wanted it so much for verushka
1	yes , i am glum , i am continually closed , i often want to leave society
1	liv : third day of captivity felton had come , but there was one more step to be taken : he had to be kept , or rather , he had to stay on his own
1	only by following at a certain distance could they make shortcuts in the zigzag path the french took
1	pavel pavlovich even swayed ; he turned pale , but a sarcastic smile at once forced itself to his lips
1	as soon as they descended into the gully , the smoke of the cannon and musket fire on the flèches became so thick that it obscured the whole ascent up the other side of the gully
1	freedom , release from sonya
1	really , since that time ; i am not lying , sir !
1	aramis had no more reason to keep him away ; he let him come in
1	it will burn still better from the cold , all i have to do is take one birch log and there 's even no need to take a log : chapter nine simply sit on the wall , peel some bark off a birch log with my hand , and set fire to it with a match , set fire to it , and shove it between the logs—and there 's your fire
1	incidentally , there are actually an awful lot of people nowadays who , out of habit , still consider themselves the younger generation , because yesterday they still were , and they do not notice that they are already verbannte
1	thousands of voices roared
1	i have studied all this morbid psychology in my practice
1	no , not very , svidrigaïlov answered , calmly
1	you are right : i shall drink
1	the date of prince andrei 's return and marriage was approaching , and his request that she prepare their father for it had not only not been fulfilled , but the matter , on the contrary , seemed to have deteriorated completely , and any reminder of countess rostov put the old prince beside himself , and he was almost always in a bad mood as it was
1	i have always sympathized with you , andrei petrovich , and all of yours , and have been a friend of your house ; but , though the princes are strangers to me , by god , i feel sorry for them
1	this quite delighted the pockmarked one , and he sniggered maliciously
1	she asked , suddenly blushing
1	now i can have a look
1	ah , do as you like !
1	this is some sort of misunderstanding said andrei
1	formerly , going into action , rostov had been afraid ; now he did not feel the least fear
1	two times two will be four even without my will
1	i am oppressed by the peace and quiet , i am afraid to look in the windows , because there 's no more painful spectacle for me now than a happy family sitting around a table and drinking tea
1	i ’ ve been waiting especially for you , he added , significantly stressing the fact that he had been waiting
1	but that is simply because i do not respect myself
1	this one was dressed in a long frieze coat , dark blue trousers , and big , torn jackboots
1	posterity will have difficulty understanding this character , which history explains only by deeds and never by reasoning
1	he said to her in a whisper
1	good , good , the tartar muttered , shrinking from the chill
1	i had imagined how i would be noble , proud , and sad , maybe even in the company of prince v—sky , and thus would be introduced straight into that world—oh , i am not sparing myself , and so be it , so be it : it must be written down exactly in these details !
1	instead of solid rows of bees covering all the spaces between the combs and warming the brood , he sees the artful , complex workmanship of the combs , but no longer in the virginal form they used to have
1	wait a minute , i will fetch zossimov
1	denisov winced still more
1	i am sorry there wo not be any priests at it
1	yesterday 's apartment , the one with the little baby , is rented in my name now , and tatyana pavlovna pays ah , well , it makes no difference to me !
1	raskolnikov thought to himself
1	but how pale you are , to be sure and your hands are trembling too ?
1	raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile
1	why don ’ t you look around the rooms once more and in all the drawers !
1	and i repeat that you are wrong
1	please do , she said , she wanted them so much
1	i would not go saving a german or a chink , but i would go in after a christian
1	the wrath that shone in the musketeer 's eyes , despite the restraint he imposed on himself , frightened his sensitive lady love
1	then they sat and wept silently
1	they prepared everything ; pyotr stepanovich started painting , then suddenly he comes : no , he says , it 's impossible to paint it like that
1	he ’ s a bit simple , but he keeps his own counsel , in the most noble fashion , to be sure
1	the french had ensconced themselves there behind the wattle fence , in a garden densely overgrown with bushes , and were firing at the cossacks crowding in the gateway
1	i sprawled on the sofa and , looking at his back , thought long and about much
1	how did you dare ?
1	his situation was especially bad because he not only had to support himself , sonya , and his mother on his twelve-hundred-rouble salary , but had to support his mother in such a way that she did not notice they were poor
1	this artist was one of his former comrades , who from a young age had borne within himself a passion for art , and with the ardent spirit of a laborer had immersed himself in it with his whole soul , had torn himself away from friends , from family , from cherished habits , and rushed to where under beautiful skies a majestic hothouse of the arts was ripening—to that wonderful rome , at the name of which the ardent heart of an artist beats so deeply and strongly
1	as the owner of a spinning mill , having put his workers in their places , strolls about the establishment , watching out for an idle spindle or the odd one squealing much too loudly , and hastens to go and slow it down or start it up at the proper speed—so anna pavlovna strolled about her drawing room , going up to a circle that had fallen silent or was too talkative , and with one word or rearrangement set the conversation machine running evenly and properly again
1	and how did you know it was me ?
1	but you live in the most unfavorable circumstances : it 's crowded , dirty , nobody looks after you , there 's no money for treatment
1	the old ladies were glad of the presents he would be bringing , and above all that natasha would come to life again
1	allow me to talk it over
1	sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits , had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming , unwilling to talk and rude to her
1	with the awkwardness of a dignified man unused to dealing with women , modest alexeich touched her waist and patted her shoulder , while she thought about money , about her mother and her death
1	you never brought the knife to pavlovsk with you ?
1	there ends , at least for the present , the charge i had to fulfill regarding you ; the rest is another person 's concern
1	but at the time of pierre 's arrival , he was not there , and there was almost no one from his staff
1	the figure of pierre with the child in his arms was now even more noticeable than before , and several russian men and women gathered around him
1	there were still people in it , there was still a fiftieth part of all the former inhabitants left in it , but it was empty
1	i was once his guardian a very nice young man and advanced
1	he longed to forget himself altogether , to forget everything , and then to wake up and begin life anew
1	i turned to her with loathing ; i was no longer reasoning coldly
1	when the reading , which lasted more than an hour , was over , langeron again stopped the snuffbox and , without looking at weyrother or anyone in particular , began speaking about the difficulty of following such a disposition , in which the position of the enemy is assumed to be known , when that position may not be known to us , since the enemy is on the move
1	but it 's all terribly painful
1	where should i go ?
1	one ran each side
1	my suitcase had long been ready , i only had to pack several things into a bundle
1	he can still be saved
1	ganya prompted the faltering general
1	he felt utterly broken : darkness and confusion were in his soul
1	she would get tired at night and go to sleep , and he would wake up and start kissing her and making the sign of the cross over her while she slept
1	when the other one put a fist the size of a clerk 's head right to his mouth and said , just try shouting !
1	belikov fussed about nervously and quickly began to dress , with a look of horror on his face
1	i need to question
1	the two friends had been talking for a few moments when a servant of m de tréville 's came in carrying a sealed packet
1	so you are conscious , brother ?
1	it was my own doing , not leaving the country , and nearly a year ago marfa petrovna gave me back the document on my name‐day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money , too
1	said berg , glancing at natasha and smiling at her , as if trying to placate her , in response to her stubborn gaze 'russia is not in moscow , she is in the hearts of her sons !
1	it seemed that these puffs of smoke now raced along , now stood still , and past them raced woods , fields , and gleaming bayonets
1	it seemed they were ready to make merry all night long
1	the other one , in the woman 's coat , stood in front of the beautiful armenian girl and looked at her silently , fixedly , with his hands in his pockets
1	all our classmates liked him , except for me alone
1	they will think it 's an allusion to the queen mother !
1	ils l'ont passé sans coup férir
1	no , you don ’ t offer a lady your arm like that , don ’ t you know how to take a lady ’ s arm ?
1	[ ] and the whistling sounds of two tin canisters rang out one after the other
1	she almost shrieked , as earlier , and flung a wad of banknotes on the table
1	you must fulfil the demands of justice
1	and this visit of the sovereign to moscow triples the forces of the russian army
1	refused to see each other , broke all ties , though before they had been known as the most inseparable of friends !
1	but this head swayed helplessly from the uneven steps of the carriers , and the cold , indifferent gaze did not know where to rest
1	said anna pavlovna , closing her eyes and pointing to hélène with a sad gesture
1	prince vassily suddenly burbled something and left
1	but no , but no catch up with him !
1	i will take the dogcart you sometimes go hunting in
1	as you know , it all ended in smoke
1	the zaporozhtsy who passed through dikanka in the fall are staying here somewhere
1	i have no idea ; i wasn ’ t there ; it must be some kind of joke
1	though , incidentally , there was no reason for any of it , because the dozen or so clerks who constituted the entire administrative machinery of the office were properly filled with fear even without that ; seeing him from far off , they set their work aside and waited , standing at attention , until their superior passed through the room
1	i wanted to speak to them , but they started throwing stones at me
1	asked the astonished athos
1	when varya was gone , ganya took the note from the table , kissed it , clucked his tongue , and performed an entrechat
1	well , so my fact consists in this , that russian liberalism is not an attack on the existing order of things , but is an attack on the very essence of our things , on the things themselves and not merely on their order , not on russian order , but on russia itself
1	he began feeling his pulse
1	sonia sat down , looked about her— at lebeziatnikov , at the notes lying on the table and then again at pyotr petrovitch and her eyes remained riveted on him
1	the tragedy of liza 's death is the hidden heart of the story , hidden precisely by the ongoing duel of her two fathers
1	said dounia , approaching him
1	she goes on nervously
1	velchaninov began talking again , suddenly stopping in front of him—just as if suddenly struck by the thought
1	i realized that i had said too much
1	it must be supposed that she was seriously ill afterwards , because the next letter i received was from yalta , where , in all likelihood , the doctors had sent her
1	these women never fall before marriage : the law of their nature is that they must be married first
1	you think it ’ s praiseworthy , but it ’ s disgusting
1	there was not the slightest cause , no sort of ground it 's a lie , a lie !
1	we do not hope to make it !
1	i am purposely not leaving out the slightest stroke from all that petty nonsense , because every little stroke of it later went into the final bouquet , where it found its proper chapter nine place , as the reader will ascertain
1	one day after dinner avdotya romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes insisted on my leaving poor parasha alone
1	there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him
1	i would hang all the brigands
1	the officer said vexedly and grasped the door as if intending to leave
1	ah , it 's you , d'artagnan , it 's you , athos !
1	from the landlady , indeed !
1	five minutes later lebeziatnikov came in with sonia
1	[ ] no one had read the manifesto yet , but everyone knew of its appearance
1	they came to the rue saint-honoré , and on the place du palais cardinal they found the dozen musketeers they had summoned pacing up and down while waiting for their comrades
1	i do not try to guess anything , madame
1	and i sometimes dreamed so much that i ’ d go out of my mind … and then this one would come : he ’ d stay for two months a year , dishonor me , offend me , inflame me , debauch me , leave me—a thousand times i wanted to drown myself in the pond , but i was base , i had no courage—well , but now … rogozhin , are you ready ?
1	but though i was wrathful , i still went completely at ease about my goal
1	and once you got frightened by a wolf , ran to me all trembling , and there was not any wolf
1	we will talk more with you later , landsman ; right now we are on our way to the tsaritsa
1	then he too went hurriedly out of the room
1	here it comes this one 's for us again !
1	the first category , generally speaking , are men conservative in temperament and law‐abiding ; they live under control and love to be controlled
1	he worried and tormented himself trying to remember , moaned , flew into a rage , or sank into awful , intolerable terror
1	yes , it wo not do without renovation , andrei yefimych said , after some reflection
1	and they really were eager to have a look at it in town
1	but in this very loathing for everything around him , pierre took a sort of irritating pleasure
1	no , it 's impossible for me to hand him a petition myself , it 's too bold !
1	i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money , i assure you , without the faintest conscience‐prick , the student added with warmth
1	today , for instance , as you were presenting the bracelet—that you were at least a little bit younger
1	he wrote letters to his daughters and to mme de staël , read novels , enjoyed the society of beautiful women , joked with generals , officers , and soldiers , and never contradicted people who wanted to prove something to him
1	the french who had taken the battery fled
1	i understand that , and he 's a scoundrel who explains it by serfdom and lowliness alone !
1	[ ] i trust only in god and in the lofty destiny of our dear emperor
1	for one instant the thought floated through his mind shall i go back ?
1	but you would not believe what a special feeling i have for you after we have been parted
1	the woman who kept the tavern was in no way prepared to give him credit ; he had ukrainian tales waited in hopes some pious squire might come and treat him ; but , as if on purpose , all the squires stayed home like honest christians and ate kutya in the bosom of their families
1	and here was that object worth sixty kopecks
1	during the few minutes he had spent on the terrace with the epanchins , he had behaved modestly , with dignity , and had not been taken aback in the least by the determined glances of lizaveta prokofyevna , who had twice looked him up and down
1	that is , higher with regard to all conventions and even the very unpleasantnesses that may come of it
1	and to write this way is like raving or a cloud
1	and it was at this same moment that the quadrille began , the last one before supper , to which the medical student had hastened so
1	for that he kept several distant female relations around him : his own sister , ailing and shrewish ; his wife 's two sisters , also wicked and multiloquent ; and then his old aunt , who had broken a rib on some occasion
1	you should have left it to me , who do know , madame
1	i ought to have been in the army , upon my word i ought
1	the man has only illegitimate children
1	and then , beyond all that , this extreme method , which the king , as a good catholic , found in no way repugnant , always ran aground on this argument of the besieging generals : la rochelle is impregnable , except by starvation
1	can you imagine why he went to petersburg they are setting up
1	having told me the news , nikolai puts a solemn expression on his face , and we begin to talk business
1	she said , blushing all over
1	in the religious respect , napoleon gave orders to ramener les popes [ ] and resume church services
1	comment me prouverez-vous la vérité de ce que vous me dites ?
1	we called tchebarov , flung him ten roubles and got the i o u back from him , and here i have the honour of presenting it to you
1	his kind and honest eyes , with tears welling up in them , at that time when she herself , weeping , had spoken to him of her loss , would not leave her imagination
1	since then she had not seen boris once
1	i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights
1	and will you love me ?
1	obviously you value your works highly
1	yes , i fell at her feet
1	for some reason he was feeling merrier and merrier
1	i was in seminary at that time , and the adventure seemed to me cruel for the king
1	how many did we crush ?
1	there was dignity , even a great deal of it , even quite unsuited to him ( so that , in truth , it was quite comical ) , but there was no anger
1	it was obvious that she was only passing through the room , from one door to the other , not thinking at all of finding anyone there
1	obviously , that dreadful storm cloud he had been calling up with all the powers of his soul and which at the same time aroused an involuntary terror in him—obviously , that storm cloud was approaching
1	there 's some horrible mystery behind all this
1	his wife wept in the corner , the baby began squealing again
1	to my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer , anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink , but you know , these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious look how she sits glaring !
1	on the contrary , it is
1	having crossed the krymsky ford , the prisoners moved on several steps , then stopped , then moved on again , and on all sides the people and vehicles grew more and more dense
1	palls of various prices ; there were even two catafalques : for a general , and for some lady
1	dmitri prokofitch was here , came to see me yesterday—i know , i know , i have a nasty , ironical temper , but what they made of it !
1	from the other side the battalion commander rode up
1	wo not you come in ?
1	( prince lev nikolaevich had not arrived yet )
1	the old men got together on village business , the muzhik replied , stepping away from him
1	he stood still , thought a moment , and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips
1	this way , this way
1	only a long time afterwards did he see clearly and become convinced of how seriously his affair with such an innocent and strange being as aglaya might have turned out
1	i drink tea and coffee with cream
1	and therefore they had to take turns , so that in every house she was expected before she arrived , and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it , even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people 's
1	do you really think i didn ’ t foresee all this hatred ?
1	i regret not having informed you of this circumstance earlier
1	the wagon was returning empty to paris , and in exchange for their transportation , the two lackeys had promised to quench the wagoner 's thirst on the way
1	let them say of each of you : he was in the great battle of moscow
1	after the battle of borodino , the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its burning , historians recognize as the most important episode of the war of the movement of the russian army from the ryazan to the kaluga road and towards the tarutino camp—the so-called flanking march beyond krasnaya pakhra
1	my guards shouted that they were sure of it
1	the gentleman approached the prince unhurriedly , with an affable smile , silently took his hand and , holding it in his own , peered into his face for some time , as if recognizing familiar features
1	yes , yes , pierre agreed
1	please , princess the prince dunyasha said in a faltering voice
1	but , to his surprise , the ringing of the bell also turned out to be a dream
1	his face seemed ugly and unpleasant to tanya
1	and then , we will never have the three hundred pistoles to give him , so we are just losing two hundred pistoles on the deal
1	do you think they would not ?
1	no , says the colonel 's wife , he 's frightened of something
1	he 's waiting for the queen to produce an heir to the crown of france
1	and what of it ?
1	he stood still before her
1	( note this : the revolver was familiar to her
1	the shoes alone , just think what that will add up to !
1	a commander in chief is never in those conditions of the beginning of some event , in which we always consider events
1	the peasant drivers , shouting at the horses and whipping them with knouts , kept running from one side to the other
1	under his feet he found the open razor lying on the rug ; he picked it up , closed it , put it in the razor case , forgotten that morning on the little table just next to the sofa on which pavel pavlovich had slept , and locked this case in his bureau with a key
1	what was that knocking , nadya ?
1	you know we ’ ve hardly said a word to each other for a whole month now
1	look : across the street , the lopukhins cleared everything out two days ago
1	katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears ; she prayed , too , now and then pulling straight the boy 's shirt , and managed to cover the girl 's bare shoulders with a kerchief , which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray
1	through the crack they were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs , at the level of the landlady 's door , and they could , as a fact , see from below that there was a light in raskolnikov 's garret
1	and i am on good terms with sofya semyonovna to this day , which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her
1	on entering the door of my petersburg novel , with all my disgraceful adventures in it , i find this preface necessary
1	the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and bore a coronet and a coat of arms at one of its corners
1	mirrors prepared by dunyasha since evening stood on natasha 's table
1	the prince wanted to say something , but he was so much at a loss that nothing came out , and , holding the coat , which he had picked up from the floor , he went towards the drawing room
1	a little window would be raised , and the lean arm of an old woman—they were the only ones to stay inside now with the grave fathers—would reach out with a sausage or a piece of pie
1	she enters my room in a petticoat , her hair not yet done , but already washed , smelling of flower cologne , and with the air of having come in by chance , and each time she says one and the same thing :
1	and this one 's distilled with peach stones ; here , take a glass , what a wonderful smell !
1	your goodness overwhelms me , monseigneur , replied d'artagnan , and i acknowledge a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me small as a worm ; but , finally , since your eminence permits me to speak frankly d'artagnan paused
1	tell me , how was she when you left ?
1	i went back to my window
1	he learns in the course of the novel that it is very difficult to judge something as complex , as many-storied , as another person , that what he — and we , too , of course — would have considered a moral failing may in fact be a higher kind of virtue
1	what , have you got a lot of money ?
1	she said nothing in reply to the medical student 's words , only her lips began to tremble
1	that 's a good thing , said the man , whom petya took for a hussar
1	to the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion , the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself
1	said franz , loading the trunk into the britzka with difficulty
1	lebedev picked up , coming back in wearing his tailcoat , blinking his eyes and pulling a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his tears
1	i , too , was in such a condition before i left for switzerland ; i , too , babbled incoherent words—you want to express yourself and can ’ t … i understand it ; i can sympathize very much , because i ’ m almost like that myself , i ’ m permitted to speak !
1	pierre , as one of the most honored guests , had to sit down to boston with ilya andreevich , the general , and the colonel
1	d'artagnan obeyed like a child , without resistance and without any objection , which showed that he really was in love
1	he crossed himself several times
1	nikolai , no longer racing , drove smoothly on the way back and , in that strange moonlight , kept peering at sonya , seeking , in that ever-changing light , behind the eyebrows and mustache , the former and the present sonya , from whom he had now resolved never to be parted
1	and he considered it necessary to be interested in it and questioned pierre about it
1	from words he let fall about his father and natasha , from the excitement with which pierre spoke of the dead man , and from the cautious , reverential tenderness with which natasha spoke of him , the boy , who was only beginning to suspect about love , put together the notion that his father had loved natasha and had bequeathed her , upon dying , to his friend
1	two months ago , after the return of the inheritance , i ran over to her to chat about versilov 's act , but i did not meet with the least sympathy ; on the contrary , she was awfully angry : it displeased her very much that it had all been returned , and not just half
1	the doctor treats his patients with water
1	it did not occur to him that he was in love with miss rostov ; he was not thinking of her ; he only pictured her to himself , and owing to that his whole life appeared to him in a new light
1	why did i say those words !
1	i dreamed that you might perhaps not want to say no to me in this
1	and you will know the happiness of forgiveness
1	meanwhile someone quickly lighted a candle , and they all beheld an unexpected sight
1	i do not remember much indeed
1	he 's the guilty one , mama , it 's he who is guilty of everything ; he never loved us
1	a third time he denied it
1	the pain started again , and marya bogdanovna advised prince andrei to leave the room
1	i will only mention that the main feature of their method consisted in finding out certain secrets of people , sometimes very honest and highly placed people ; then they went to these persons and threatened to reveal the documents ( which they sometimes did not have at all ) , and demanded a ransom to keep silent
1	i do not know if you are his wife , but you should know that this gentleman cuts out newspaper advertisements that governesses and teachers publish with their last money , and goes to these unfortunate women , looking for a dishonorable profit and getting them into trouble through money
1	sonia was silent a long while , as though she could not answer
1	above all , i found it strange that he not only had not smiled , but had not shown the smallest reaction in that sense , when i had told him directly earlier that i wanted to challenge him to a duel
1	anticipating a clear , long , happy day , kovrin remembered that it was still only the beginning of may and the whole summer still lay ahead , just as clear , long , and happy , and suddenly a joyful young feeling stirred in his breast , such as he had experienced in childhood running about in these gardens
1	know then that my wife was educated in a high‐class school for the daughters of noblemen , and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit
1	when they knew that for half an hour i belonged not to science , not to my students , but to them alone and no one else
1	if there had been just one person to whom he could talk , unburden his soul !
1	he made some ten leaps , not quickly , letting the dogs get closer to him , and finally , choosing his direction and realizing the danger , laid his ears back and dashed off as fast as his legs would carry him
1	the torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night
1	there was firmness , calm , and a lively readiness in the expression of his eyes , such as had never been there before
1	this young man is the count 's son , she added in a lower voice
1	the countess went to the icon room , and sonya found her there , kneeling before the few remaining icons that hung here and there on the wall
1	we have agreed that tonight will be a dinner for pleasure and not a word about business
1	ah , dear nadya , sasha began his usual after-dinner conversation , if only you would listen to me !
1	( i took it out of the drawer )
1	they say he beat her dreadfully
1	pyotr petrovitch , do be kind and go !
1	i do not know , my dear sir
1	she cried as she rushed to the cradle
1	let 's skip a page , maybe it will get better :
1	he had to work from morning till night , giving penny lessons , doing copying work , and still go hungry , because all his earnings went to support his mother
1	d'artagnan profited from the occasion to speak with m de tréville about the letter with the big red seal and the ducal arms
1	it was clear that this and so referred to many things they both understood without naming them
1	you were talking to her yesterday i should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool , raskolnikov
1	though a delight in the absurd and a sharp eye for human folly remained central to his work , he was no longer merely a humorist
1	what could all that mean in comparison with the predestination of god , without whose will not one hair falls from man 's head
1	i told her all about me and about her
1	i would rather go to my friend , the explosive lieutenant ; how i shall surprise him , what a sensation i shall make !
1	well , he can ask as much interest as he likes , devil take it !
1	but i confess that after many attempts i even began to despair : we simply could not bump into each other – and that was that !
1	you saw him clearly ?
1	and it all happened as was said : to this day a wondrous knight stands on horseback in the carpathians , gazing on the dead men gnawing the dead man in the bottomless chasm , and he feels the dead man lying under the ground growing and gnawing his own bones in terrible torment and shaking all the earth terribly
1	pray when you eat
1	here he turned to one of the oarsmen , who knocked hot ashes from his pipe and transferred them to his master 's pipe
1	suffering , too , is a good thing
1	why , for his sake we would not shrink even from sonia 's fate
1	i was frowning deeply
1	no one had given tushin any orders about where to shoot or with what , and , having consulted his sergeant major zakharchenko , for whom he had great respect , he had decided that it would be good to set fire to the village
1	i have met some already
1	why , that 's a veritable fortune , my friend
1	xlii : the wine of anjou and he handed the note to his comrades
1	power is the sum total of wills transferred to one person
1	nothing could be found of his enormous wealth , either ; but seeing the slashed remains of lofty works of art whose worth went beyond millions , its terrible use became clear
1	when he was alone , he had not gone twenty paces before he sank , as usual , into deep thought
1	and he writes the famous order of the day to general bennigsen
1	i have lost two , but i still have this one , whom i am sure to keep for several days at least
1	well , then accept his proposal
1	what if they think that i shaved on purpose to ?
1	would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister ?
1	svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk , the wine had affected him for a moment , but it was passing off every minute
1	general ivolgin and prince myshkin !
1	for him there was no doubt that she was the victim of the cardinal 's vengeance , and , as we know , the cardinal 's vengeance was terrible
1	natasha was looking in the mirror , but did not see herself
1	he had a burning in his head ; he felt that he was losing blood , and he saw above him that distant , lofty , and eternal sky
1	he kissed the tips of his fingers
1	they rode to the opposite hill
1	it was i , he shouts ,
1	vain and indiscreet , he could be seen through like a crystal
1	what joy i will bring to the one whose wife i become !
1	the gloomy pines with their shaggy roots , which had seen him there last year so young , joyful and lively , now did not whisper but stood motionless , mute , as if they did not recognize him
1	tell me , why should i necessarily be noble , especially if it all lasts no more than a minute ?
1	pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart
1	aramis was mumbling some verses , and porthos tore a few hairs from his mustache now and then in a sign of despair
1	( ) what force produces the movement of peoples ?
1	the queen bowed as a sign of submission and followed the ladies who were to lead her to her dressing room
1	the most awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost , had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial circumstance
1	he 's not been here since yesterday he quarrelled with everyone on leaving in the rudest way
1	with his sighing , his whining , his dark glasses on his pale little face—you know , a little face , like a weasel's—he crushed us all , and we gave in , lowered petrov 's and yegorov 's marks for conduct , locked them up , and finally expelled them both
1	what sort of visitors ?
1	( it almost gave him pleasure to admit this )
1	he was about to mount his horse
1	he cried , looking at her like a half-wit , timid and suddenly taking heart to the point of insolence , here ’ s eighteen thousand !
1	are you telling the truth ?
1	how do i explain them ?
1	the prince asked suddenly
1	the young man did not dispute it and took the money
1	they have gone over to the pockmarked one now
1	his feelings towards versilov began to change , as it were
1	it was a big room , high , darkish , cluttered with all sorts of furniture—mostly big desks , bureaus , bookcases in which ledgers and papers were kept
1	listen : when i went then to the old woman 's i only went to try you may be sure of that !
1	she made haste to smile , afraid that he might not like the reproach
1	so that the post office has long since acquired the reputation of an institution one fears to visit
1	a certain darkening of the mind , sir
1	indeed , the door opened , and the mother superior came in
1	another time—this was a little earlier—i announced that professor perov had died
1	she cried , remember that i loved you !
1	thrice they killed me , thrice i rose from the dead
1	forgive me , i am not a wise man or a philosopher , ivan dmitrich went on irritably , and i understand nothing about it
1	far down the sidewalk i made out the black figures of passersby in the darkness ; i started running after them and , catching up with them , looked each one in the face as i ran past
1	i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler 's for a rouble and a half
1	the quarrels began with her suddenly deciding to lend money in her own way , to appraise things above their value , and she even deigned a couple of times to enter into a dispute with me on the subject
1	so beautiful , so young !
1	walking outside the city gates one day , he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there , that he was waiting for svidrigaïlov
1	in poland he all but killed a jew , if you want to know
1	there were sounds of singing , of clarionet and violin , and the boom of a turkish drum
1	he suddenly embraced the prince
1	suddenly something strange happens to one of the cardplaying soldiers
1	she 's begging not to be brought out , velchaninov thought
1	he shouted , and then i retain my right to give my opinion as well
1	but no one is there
1	and the hope of relief and the show of compassion comfort him , while his mother rubs his bump
1	he talked about something only with lambert , and then almost in a whisper , and then it was almost only lambert who talked , while the pockmarked one just got off with fragmentary and angry ultimatums
1	i tell you , he didn ’ t want to …
1	whatever they say to me , however kind they are to me , still i ’ m always oppressed with them for some reason , and i ’ m terribly glad when i can go quickly to my comrades , and my comrades have always been children—not because i ’ m a child myself , but simply because i ’ m drawn to children
1	and he once more tugged at the door‐handle
1	the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver
1	there were no labor-loving artisans , and the peasants caught the commissaries , who ventured too far afield with this proclamation , and killed them
1	oh , i would recognize him just by the feather in his hat or the tip of his cloak !
1	no , on my honor and faith as a gentleman , i bought it myself , and out of my own pocket , replied the one who had just been called by the name of porthos
1	oh , it makes no difference to me !
1	he was obviously thinking of nothing at that moment but the fine figure he would cut as he marched past his superior
1	velchaninov flew into a rage , having already parted from the official and ascribing all his failure with him to the sudden appearance of this impudent fellow
1	because when i ’ m not home , i take the key with me , and nobody comes in for three or four days , even to tidy up , that ’ s how i set it up
1	he looked at the singing natasha and something new and happy occurred in his soul
1	later she told me : ' i asked the caretaker , she says , 'where apartment number such-and-such was
1	do not buy anything from that one !
1	suddenly he got up
1	misfortunes never come singly : vasya was summoned to the office to draw lots
1	will you eat it or not ?
1	he had visited moscow several times , had passed by not far from otradnoe , but had never once been to the rostovs '
1	and now , when he had already lost all hope , i suddenly come on my own , and in such madness—precisely the state he needed
1	i speak thus as a judge , and i know that i am guilty
1	several fantastic and extremely strange ideas that he uttered then have remained in my heart forever
1	here are the fruits of your work , i said to her , pointing to the old man
1	alpatych was not at home : he had gone to the authorities
1	one cup , repeated the judge
1	zhak and so on near all the buildings and then beyond the barracks and the gates
1	sonya , natasha , petya , anna mikhailovna , vera , the old count embraced him ; servants and maids filled the room , talking and ah-ing
1	much has also been said about the tragic ( or at least terribly sad ) essence of its vision
1	shouted razumihin , louder than ever , you think i am attacking them for talking nonsense ?
1	denisov blushed like a girl ( how strange it was to see a blush on that mustached , old , and drunken face ) , and boldly began to set forth his plan for cutting the enemy 's line of operations between smolensk and the vyazma
1	they took their places , and the ballet began
1	oh , god , lukyan timofeich , what are all these roles of yours !
1	i invited you to see me quite in a friendly way
1	the landlady who provided him with garret , dinners , and attendance , lived on the floor below , and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen , the door of which invariably stood open
1	prince vassily and anatole were given separate rooms
1	it was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease , developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime , continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after , according to the individual case , and then passed off like any other disease
1	it sometimes happened , if you talked him into telling something a second time , that you would look and he would throw in some new thing or change it so it was unrecognizable
1	napoleon , with his assurance that the good was not what was good but whatever came into his head , wrote to kutuzov the first words that came into his head , which had no meaning at all
1	my excellency is taken outside , put into a carriage , and driven somewhere
1	and what would make me take all this burden on myself ?
1	i have seen people who , at the first bucket of cold water , renounce not only their actions , but even their idea , and begin to laugh at something they considered sacred only an hour before
1	marya sysoevna told him much more : there was , for instance , one occasion when , if it had not been for marya sysoevna , liza might have thrown herself out the window
1	it is necessary to think of the future , of you i love you all like my own children , you know that
1	in the middle of the night three soldiers , bringing brushwood , settled next to him and began to make a fire
1	this beautiful and lofty has indeed weighed heavy on my head in my forty years ; but that 's my forty years , while then – oh , then it would be different !
1	have you been spying ?
1	i sat down , lighted a candle , and began to think
1	from what i have heard , pierre , blushing , again mixed into the conversation , almost all the nobility have already gone over to bonaparte 's side
1	every day , getting out of bed at around eleven , olga ivanovna would play the piano or , if it was sunny , would paint something in oils
1	he did badly in occupying himself with the frontline units of the army ; he acted badly in disbanding the semy-onovsky regiment , and so on
1	you see , my most gentle sir , i have read your memorandum , arakcheev interrupted , speaking only the first words benignly , again without looking him in the face and lapsing more and more into a grumblingly contemptuous tone
1	how can it be ?
1	one woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away , but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare
1	milady looked into his eyes and read : love , love
1	after her government apartment , caught up in impressions of light , colors , music , noise , anya passed her gaze over the hall and thought : ah , how good !
1	count orlov-denisov with his cossacks ( the most insignificant detachment of them all ) was the only one who ended up in the right place and at the right time
1	yes , yes , lambert kept confirming , it 's all as you he kept exchanging glances with alphonsinka
1	i must hurry , i must hurry , my friend , i ’ m late !
1	when i asked him where he got them , he said that he picked them up in the street
1	princess marya had decided to receive the rostovs , but was afraid every moment that the prince might perform some escapade , being very agitated by the rostovs ' arrival
1	maybe i will come here leave me , but do not leave them
1	i ’ m expecting an excellent parody
1	but he 's the one who abducted me !
1	angry , yes , he was angry , and maybe rightly , rogozhin replied , but it was my brother who really got me
1	and first of all , write me your request to m des essarts
1	so a literary man , an author took five roubles for his coat‐tail in an 'honourable house ' ?
1	the supper was a perfect omniumgatherum , though a cook had been hired to prepare it , some general 's serf : there was a galantine , there was tongue with potatoes , there were meat cakes with green peas , there was , finally , a goose , and , to crown it all , blancmange
1	no , i am not a philosopher , but everyone ought to preach it , because it 's reasonable
1	this , they say , is the commander of all the emperor alexander 's guards , said the first , pointing to a wounded russian officer in the white uniform of the horse guards
1	did you go out yesterday ?
1	some ten factory workers were sitting on benches by the tables in a small , dirty room
1	you did not expect a visitor , rodion romanovitch , porfiry explained , laughing
1	rostov nearly cried , seizing his hair with both hands
1	oh , loving , over‐partial hearts !
1	pavlusha , my darling , she said , my dear one !
1	at the sight of the strange city with the never-seen forms of its extraordinary architecture , napoleon experienced that somewhat envious and restless curiosity which people experience at the sight of alien forms of life that know nothing of them
1	brother , what are you saying ?
1	through the double windows one could hear the noise of rooks in the garden and the singing of starlings
1	ivan ilyich was on the verge of tears
1	nastasya filippovna cried , making a wry and displeased face , like a flighty , foolish little girl whose toy is being taken away
1	he was as happy as a lover who has obtained a hoped-for rendezvous
1	and you say frenchmen he will undo the whole distance for you !
1	m d'artagnan will die
1	afanasy ivanovich would say
1	in the middle of the third écossaise , chairs began moving in the drawing room where the count and marya dmitrievna were playing , and the greater part of the honored guests and old folk , stretching after sitting so long and putting their wallets and purses in their pockets , came to the door of the ballroom
1	an hour later he was in petersburg , and after nine o ’ clock he was ringing at rogozhin ’ s
1	and milady could as yet only dimly discern the means that would lead her to that result
1	the prince slapped his hand on the table
1	vasin observed to me with a smile that he remembered it as it was , and moreover the notes were without any system , about whatever came to mind
1	nastasya brought him some food ; he ate and drank with appetite , almost with greediness
1	i am unable to reason
1	finish quickly , dear boy , it ’ s time he went to bed
1	i cried , coming to my senses
1	princess marya did not reply
1	asked svidrigaïlov , looking at him curiously
1	i am asking generally , generally , not in particular !
1	they say some dona should ascend the throne
1	i am convinced that a great many people would find it very funny to learn that such trash was aiming at power
1	prince nikolai andreich , who had always laughed at medical science , had recently , on the advice of mlle bourienne , admitted this doctor to his presence and grown used to him
1	through the chink in the screen he could see the portrait properly covered with a sheet—as he himself had covered it
1	i confess that i hastened here for the sake of the women
1	what do you want of me ?
1	they would gone to the estate outside moscow
1	but it was very dark in the room ; the petersburg white summer nights were beginning to turn darker , and if it had not been for the full moon , it would have been difficult to see anything in rogozhin ’ s dark rooms with the blinds drawn
1	napoleon himself , noticing her in the theater , asked who she was and praised her beauty
1	yes , i saw him and became convinced that he is afraid of a general battle more than anything in the world , dolgorukov repeated , obviously cherishing this overall conclusion which he had come to after his meeting with napoleon
1	well , here 's a chance , at least
1	let us not seek to penetrate what they contain of the mysterious , for how should we dare aspire , miserable sinners that we are , to initiate ourselves into the terrible and sacred secrets of providence , so long as we wear this fleshly husk , which raises an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal ?
1	the regimental commander said that the attack had been beaten off , coming up with this military term to describe what had happened in his regiment ; but in reality he did not know himself what had happened in that half hour among the troops entrusted to him , and he could not say for certain whether the attack had been beaten off or his regiment had been crushed by the attack
1	you understand me as well as … darya alexeevna ’ s chambermaid , who went to the justice of the peace the other day to make a complaint against her fiancé
1	well , i never , never expected !
1	ganya stamped his foot in impatience
1	if you have to go now , sonia was beginning , not looking at razumihin at all , and still more embarrassed
1	sonya was twirling and was just about to balloon her dress and crouch down when he came in
1	the princess was looking intently into his eyes with her luminous gaze while he said that
1	however , her melancholy began to turn into irritation , and shortly before boris 's departure , she undertook a decisive plan
1	nadezhda fedoseevna has recommended you to me quite flatteringly
1	for a long time raskolnikov did not know of his mother 's death , though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached siberia
1	your things would not in any case be lost , he went on calmly and coldly
1	in kutuzov 's report mention was also made of the russian losses , and among them tuchkov , bagration , and kutaisov were named
1	he did not yet know himself what , in fact , he was going to do now with pavel pavlovich : kill him for something , or simply look for him , so as to inform him of his daughter 's death and the need for his assistance in the funeral ?
1	mud and swamp , go ahead and knock on your coffin lid at night , when dead men rise : 'let me out , good people , to live in the world !
1	it was long since there had been so much merrymaking in moscow as there was that year
1	evgeny pavlovich takes it very much to heart , and he does have a heart , as he has already proved by the fact that he receives letters from kolya and even sometimes answers those letters
1	wincing vexedly at the efforts that had to be made in order to take off his kaftan and trousers , the prince undressed , lowered himself heavily onto the bed , and seemed to lapse into thought , looking contemptuously at his yellow , shriveled legs
1	what , you weren ’ t expecting parfyon rogozhin ?
1	institution of great national significance , because it is , so to speak , a step into a new era of the russian economy and russian industry
1	i only say he is a nice man in his own way !
1	i think my throat got frozen in this the night before christmas cursed cold
1	can you guess anything ?
1	the whole numerous family of the teacher ’ s widow—all girls with a year ’ s difference , from fifteen down to seven years old—poured out after their mother and surrounded him , their mouths gaping
1	she also wanted to write that he owed a lot to her good influence , and if he acted badly , it was only because her influence was paralyzed by various ambiguous persons , like the one who had been hiding behind the painting that day
1	i was losing my mind , i had megalomania , but i was gay , lively , and even happy , i was interesting and original
1	the three musketeers though athos was barely thirty years old and was extremely handsome of body and mind , no one knew him to have a mistress
1	sonya sat down before the mirror , got into the right position , and began to look
1	illness is nobody 's friend , i realize
1	she 's capable of anything
1	may i not serve as your maid ?
1	you kept jumping up for nothing
1	but those who knew him intimately could see that some great change had taken place in him that day
1	the student turned sharply to him , pulled some sort of grimace , and , bringing his face indecently close to his excellency 's , gave a loud cock-crow
1	he shouted , that 's no evidence
1	oh , it 's not for me , not for me , but for a poor old man , who alone loved you sincerely , who managed to become attached to you in his heart as to his own son , and who longs for you even to this day !
1	svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly
1	aramis pressed his man so vigorously that , after falling back some fifty paces , he ended by taking flight for all he was worth and disappeared , to the hooting of the lackeys
1	pyotr petrovitch so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were attributed to him
1	i told them that i , i alone , had done it all ; that it was i who had brought them depravity , infection , and the lie !
1	at first i said i would not take any message to you
1	everywhere curses were heard on the enemy of the human race bonapartius ; militia and recruits were being gathered from the villages , and divergent news kept coming from the theater of the war , false as usual and therefore reinterpreted in various ways
1	he looked at me in extreme astonishment , his eyes somehow dull
1	of him still greater precautions were demanded—that he stand by the gazebo and turn his face fully toward the fence
1	ivanushka , sipping from the saucer , looked at the young men from under his brows with his sly feminine eyes
1	this visitor will cure her !
1	she jumped up , shouting with all her might , trembling : 'let me go , let me go !
1	pierre could no longer make himself turn away and close his eyes
1	varvara grumbled , walking off
1	then he walked to the front row and sat down next to dolokhov , nudging with his elbow in a friendly and casual way that same dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly
1	a single candle‐end lighted up the scene
1	why do you think so ill of me ?
1	the laughter increased around him ; the officer , who must have been a man who laughed easily , simply burst with laughter
1	who told you that ?
1	the insult was terrible , and , unknown though it was to the rest of the world , i felt it living and stirring in the bottom of my heart
1	i do not know
1	a disposition for bagration
1	with a swelling heart , with glittering eyes , pierre gazed into the mason 's face , listened to him , did not interrupt him , did not ask anything , and believed with his whole soul what this stranger was telling him
1	what did he mean by that ?
1	i am looking round
1	modern history has not done that
1	the uncle strapped up the hare , flipped it nimbly and deftly across his horse 's croup , as if reproaching them all by this flipping , and , mounting his chestnut with such a look as though he did not even want to speak with anyone , rode off
1	i said to ask the gentry—you did not listen then
1	yes , yes why , do you imagine that was why i spoke about government quarters eh ?
1	this condition is never observed by general historians , and therefore , in order to explain the resultant force , they must necessarily allow for an unexplained force , besides the insufficient components , which acts upon the composite
1	what if some man or youth imagines that he is a lycurgus or mahomet—a future one of course—and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles he has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it and tries to get it do you see ?
1	he fulfilled his duties with such an air as if he were bestowing the highest favor upon me
1	i knew that andronikov had already been transferred to petersburg , so i decided to find mme
1	the disorder of his mind , the terror that spurred him on , the shouts of some patrols that set off in pursuit of him , and the hoots of some passersby who , despite the late hour , were going about their business , only quickened his pace
1	i will make up for it by some good deed
1	right , right , he would say , looking over the enormous , opened-out table
1	as though that godless calumny was not enough—this vile creature attacks me !
1	would they have any supper tonight ?
1	felton waded into the water up to his waist , not wishing to entrust his precious cargo to anyone
1	i took comfort in that even then , and am of the same mind now
1	he began to pace the room rapidly , ruffling his hair , now sitting down on a chair , now jumping up and moving to the couch , constantly picturing himself receiving visitors , men and women , going up to a canvas and making dashing gestures over it with a brush , trying to impart graciousness to the movement of his arm
1	but you ’ re on a completely false track !
1	a sister-in-law is a sharp claw , but this one would not hurt a fly
1	mme coquenard , i gave you the preference
