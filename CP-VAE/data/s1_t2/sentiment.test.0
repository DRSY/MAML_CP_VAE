alexei fyodorovich karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovich karamazov , a landowner in our district who became a celebrity ( and is remembered to this day ) because of the tragic and mysterious end he met exactly thirteen years ago , which will be described in its proper place .
for the moment , i will only say of this landowner ( as they referred to him here , although he spent hardly any time on his land ) that he belonged to a peculiar though widespread human type , the sort of man who is not only wretched and depraved but also muddle-headed—muddle-headed in a way that allows him to pull off all sorts of shady little financial deals and not much else .
fyodor karamazov , for instance , started with next to nothing ; he was just about the lowliest landowner among us , a man who would dash off to dine at other people ’ s tables whenever he was given a chance and who sponged off people as much as he could . yet , at his death , they found that he had a hundred thousand rubles in hard cash .
and with all that , throughout his life he remained one of the most muddle-headed eccentrics in our entire district .
let me repeat : it was not stupidity , for most such eccentrics are really quite intelligent and cunning , and their lack of common sense is of a special kind , a national variety .
he had been married twice and had three sons—the eldest , dmitry , by his first wife , and the other two , ivan and alexei , by the second .
fyodor karamazov ’ s first wife came from a fairly wealthy family of landed gentry—the miusovs—also from our district .
why should a girl with a dowry , a beautiful girl moreover , one of those bright , clever young things who in this generation are no longer rare and who even cropped up occasionally in the last—why should she marry such a worthless freak , as they called him ? i will not really attempt to explain .
but , then , i once knew a young lady of the old , romantic generation who , after several years of secret love for a gentleman whom , please note , she could have peacefully married at any moment she chose , invented insurmountable obstacles for herself and , one stormy night , jumped from a steep , rather cliff-like bank into a fairly deep , rapid river and drowned , all because she fancied herself an ophelia out of shakespeare .
indeed , if the bank , on which she had had her eye for a long time , had been less picturesque or had there simply been a flat bank , it is conceivable that the suicide would never have taken place at all .
this is a true story , and it must be assumed that in the past two or three generations quite a few similar incidents have occurred . in the same way , what adelaida miusov did was undoubtedly an echo of outside influences and also the act of exasperation of a captive mind .
perhaps she was trying to display feminine independence , to rebel against social conventions , against the despotism of her family and relatives , while her ready imagination convinced her , if only for a moment , that fyodor karamazov , despite his reputation as a sponger , was nevertheless one of the boldest and most caustic men of that period of transition toward better things , whereas in reality he was nothing but a nasty buffoon .
the fact that the marriage plans included elopement added piquancy to it , making it more exciting for adelaida . fyodor , at that time , would , of course , have done anything to improve his lowly position , and the opportunity to latch on to a good family and to pocket a dowry was extremely tempting to him .
as for love , there does not seem to have been any , either on the bride ’ s part or , despite her beauty , on karamazov ’ s . this was perhaps a unique case in fyodor karamazov ’ s life , for he was as sensual as a man can be , one who throughout his life was always prepared , at the slightest encouragement , to chase any skirt .
but his wife just happened to be the one woman who did not appeal to him sensually in the least . right after the elopement , adelaida realized that she felt nothing but scorn for her husband .
despite the fact that her family accepted the situation quite soon and gave the runaway bride her dowry , relations between husband and wife became an everlasting succession of quarrels .
as to the little country estate and the quite decent town house that were also part of her dowry , he kept trying desperately to have them transferred to his name by some suitable deed ; he probably would have succeeded because of the loathing and disgust his constant pleading and begging inspired in his wife , because she would do anything to have peace , sick and tired as she was of him ; but luckily adelaida ’ s family intervened in time to put a stop to his greed . people knew that husband and wife often came to actual blows and rumor had it that it was she who beat him , rather than he her .
indeed , adelaida was a hot-tempered , bold , dark , and impatient lady endowed with remarkable physical strength .
finally she eloped with a half-starved tutor , a former divinity student , leaving her husband with their three-year-old boy , mitya . fyodor karamazov immediately installed a regular harem in the house and indulged in the most scandalous drunken debauchery .
but between one orgy and the next , he would drive all over the province complaining tearfully to all and sundry of adelaida ’ s desertion , and revealing on these occasions certain unsavory intimate details of their conjugal life that any other husband would have been ashamed to mention . he even seemed to enjoy—indeed , to feel flattered by—his ridiculous role as a cuckolded husband , for he insisted on describing his own disgrace in minute detail , even embellishing on it .
why , fyodor pavlovich , people remarked , you act as if an honor had been bestowed upon you .
you seem pleased despite your sorrow . many even added that he was delighted to have the role of clown thrust upon him , that he only pretended to be unaware of his ridiculous position in order to make it even funnier .
but who can really tell ?
he finally succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife .
it led to petersburg where the poor thing had moved with her divinity student and where she had abandoned herself to a life of complete emancipation . fyodor karamazov immediately busied himself with preparations for the journey to petersburg , and perhaps he would have gone , although he certainly had no idea what he would do there .
but once he had decided to go , he felt that he had a special reason for plunging into a bout of unrestrained drunkenness—to fortify himself for the journey .
and just at that time his in-laws received word that adelaida had died in petersburg .
she died suddenly , in a garret , of typhus according to some , of starvation according to others .
karamazov was drunk when he learned of his wife ’ s death , and some say he exclaimed joyfully , raising his hands to heaven : lord , now let your servant depart in peace . but according to others , he wept , sobbing like a little boy so that people felt sorry for him despite the disgust he aroused in them .
it is quite possible that they all were right , that he rejoiced in his regained freedom and wept for the woman from whom he had been freed , both at once .
in most cases , people , even the most vicious , are much more naive and simple-minded than we assume them to be .
it is , of course , easy to imagine what sort of a father such a man would be , how he would bring up his children .
and he lived up to expectation : he completely and thoroughly neglected his child by adelaida . he did not do so out of any deliberate malice or resentment toward the child ’ s mother , but simply because he forgot all about the little boy .
and while he was pestering people with his tears and self-pitying stories , while he was turning his home into a house of debauchery , a faithful servant of the household , gregory , took the three-year-old mitya into his care . if it hadn ’ t been for gregory , there would have been no one to change the boy ’ s shirt .
moreover , it so happened that the child ’ s relations on his mother ’ s side had also , at first , forgotten his existence .
mitya ’ s grandfather , that is , adelaida ’ s father , mr. miusov , was no longer alive ; his widow , mitya ’ s grandmother , had moved to moscow and was in very poor health ; and , in the meantime , adelaida ’ s sisters had married and moved away . so mitya spent almost a year in gregory ’ s little house in the servants ’ quarters .
and , even if his father had occasionally remembered him ( he could not , after all , have been completely unaware of the child ’ s existence ) , karamazov would have sent his son back to the servants ’ quarters anyway , because a child would have been in the way during the orgies .
but one day a first cousin of adelaida ’ s returned from paris .
peter miusov , who was later to settle abroad permanently , was at that time still a young man , but he was already an exception among the miusovs : he was an enlightened , big-city gentleman , glittering with foreign polish , a european through and through who , later in life , was to become a typical liberal of the ’ s and ’ s .
he met proudhon personally , as well as bakunin , and , toward the end of his wanderings , liked best to tell of his experiences during the three days of the february revolution of which he had witnessed in paris , implying that he himself had taken part in it , just short , perhaps , of manning the barricades .
this was one of the most gratifying recollections of his youth . he was a man of independent means , with an income from an estate of a thousand-odd souls , as property was evaluated in the old days .
no sooner had young peter miusov taken possession of his estate than he started an endless lawsuit against the monastery . it was something about fishing privileges or wood-cutting rights , i ’ m not sure which , but he felt that in suing clericals he was doing his duty as a citizen and an enlightened man .
when miusov heard what had happened to adelaida , whom he , of course , remembered , having even , at one time , taken a special interest in her , and when he learned of mitya ’ s plight , he decided to intervene , although that involved approaching karamazov , whom miusov loathed and despised with all the ardor of youth .
this was the first time that he met fyodor karamazov ; he told him point blank that he wished to take the boy and be responsible for his education .
later , he liked to tell at length what had happened at that meeting , because he felt it revealed a great deal about karamazov ’ s character . when miusov first broached the subject of mitya , the fellow stared at him blankly , as though he could not understand what child miusov was talking about , and he seemed positively taken aback when reminded that he had a young son .
and although miusov ’ s story may have been exaggerated , there was certainly an element of truth in it .
it is a fact that all his life karamazov liked to act the fool and assume all sorts of surprising roles ; he would do so even when he had nothing to gain , indeed , even when it could be positively to his disadvantage , as in this instance .
this is a quirk found in many people , even very clever ones , let alone the likes of fyodor karamazov . miusov at first went about the matter with some zest , and was even appointed mitya ’ s guardian ( jointly with karamazov ) , since the boy had , after all , the small estate and the town house coming to him as his inheritance from his mother .
but , not being tied down by a family of his own , just as soon as he had wound up his business in our town , which consisted of collecting the revenue from his estate , he went dashing off to paris for a long stay . he left the boy in the care of a relative of his , a lady who lived in moscow .
miusov settled in paris for good and lost sight of mitya , his interest in the boy petering out completely after the february revolution , which made such an ineradicable impression on him .
in the meantime , the moscow lady died and mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters .
i believe he had to change homes for a fourth time soon afterward .
i won ’ t expand on this topic here since i will have a great deal to say later about this first-born son of fyodor karamazov ’ s , but i must supply a few facts right away , without which i could not even begin my novel .
first of all , mitya—that is , dmitry fyodorovich karamazov—was the only one of fyodor pavlovich karamazov ’ s sons who grew up under the impression that , however hard up he might be , he would , when he came of age , come into his inheritance from his mother and that he would then be financially independent .
he was soon demoted to the ranks for fighting a duel , only to be restored to his rank again for gallantry . after this he led a wild , gay life that cost a good deal of money . since , until he came of age , he never received a single kopek from his father , he was deep in debt by the time that day arrived .
it would appear that , even then , dmitry took a dislike to his father . he stayed at the paternal house only a short time , leaving as soon as he had managed to get a very small sum from the old man , together with some vague agreement about sending him the revenue from his estate . it must be noted here that on this occasion dmitry failed to find out from his father what the total worth of his estate was or what income it yielded .
karamazov discovered right away ( and this must be noted too ) that his son had an erroneous and exaggerated notion of his inheritance , and this discovery pleased him for it fitted in with his own schemes .
he realized that the young man was irresponsible , violent , passionate , unruly , impatient , and that he couldn ’ t wait to satisfy all his whims and impulses . and karamazov now knew how to handle dmitry : the fellow could always be placated , at least temporarily , with small handouts .
karamazov proceeded immediately to exploit his son ’ s weakness , putting him off with small sums . this went on for four years until , finally , dmitry lost patience . he made a second appearance in town , this time to force on his father a final settlement of their accounts .
he was quite stunned to hear from karamazov that he had already received , in the many installments , a sum amounting to the value of his estate , that , if anything , it was he who was now in debt to his father , and that , moreover , in view of such and such an agreement which he himself had insisted upon at one point , he had renounced all further claims , etc. , etc . the young man was dumbfounded , accused his father of cheating him , and acted as if he would go out of his mind . it was this confrontation between karamazov and his eldest son that led to the catastrophe which is the subject ( or at least the external plot ) of my first , preliminary novel .
shortly after getting the four-year-old mitya off his hands , fyodor karamazov married a second time .
his second marriage lasted eight years .
he brought back his second wife , sofia , who was a very young girl , from another province , where he had gone to transact some small business affair with a jew who was his partner in the deal .
drunkard and lecher though he was , karamazov was constantly on the lookout for a profitable opportunity to invest some of his capital and , since he was unencumbered by scruples , these ventures were usually quite successful .
sofia was the daughter of an obscure deacon . she lost her parents in early childhood and , having no other relatives , was brought up by a wealthy old lady , the widow of general vorokhov . the old woman was her benefactress and her tormentor .
i don ’ t know the details , but i heard that one day the meek and uncomplaining creature had to be cut down from a rope she had tied to a nail in the storeroom . this shows how hard it was for her to submit to the whims and the constant nagging of the old woman who , although not really wicked , had been made tyrannical and eccentric by sheer idleness .
when fyodor karamazov asked for sofia ’ s hand , mrs. vorokhov made inquiries about him and , consequently , when he reappeared , had him thrown out .
so , as with his first marriage , he asked the girl to elope with him . had sofia known a bit more about his past , she might have turned him down , even in her situation ; but everything had taken place in another province and , besides , what judgment could a sixteen-year-old girl make , when all she felt was that she would rather jump in the river than stay with her benefactress ? this is how the poor thing came to exchange a benefactress for a benefactor .
the general ’ s widow was outraged and refused to give her charge a single kopek , laying a curse on them both instead .
but then , on this occasion , collecting a dowry had not been karamazov ’ s main motive .
although up till then he had been aroused exclusively by the coarser types of feminine good looks , the lecher ’ s imagination was caught now by the striking beauty of this innocent creature and , indeed , by her child-like innocence itself . as he used to say himself later , with a nasty snicker : those innocent eyes of hers slit my soul open like a razor .
in a lecher like fyodor karamazov , of course , it only added new spice to his sensual desires .
he felt that , since he had accepted this wife without dowry , he had every right to treat her without any consideration whatever—she was , he said , indebted to him since he had practically cut her down from a rope .
he took advantage of her phenomenal humility to trample underfoot the most ordinary decencies of marriage , even to the point of bringing loose women into the house and holding orgies in her presence . to indicate how far he went , i will mention that gregory , the dour , stupid , argumentative old servant , who had hated his former mistress adelaida , now took sofia ’ s side , stood up for her , and swore back at his master in a manner that was quite intolerable from a servant ; once he even broke up a party and drove the guests and the women out of the house .
after a while the wretched girl , who had been terrorized since early childhood , broke down , afflicted with a nervous disorder sometimes found in peasant women , who are then called shriekers .
her sickness brought on attacks of hysteria so violent that at times she completely lost her reason .
but this did not prevent her from bearing fyodor karamazov two sons—ivan , in the first year of marriage , and alexei , three years later .
when she died alexei was only just over three , but i know for sure that he remembered his mother all his life , though , of course , as in a dream .
after their mother ’ s death , the fate of the two little boys was a repetition of their older brother mitya ’ s . their father seemed to forget them immediately and they were so completely neglected that , like mitya before them , they ended up in gregory ’ s cottage .
and it was in the servants ’ quarters that the boys were found by the rich and eccentric widow of general vorokhov , their mother ’ s former benefactress .
for the entire eight years of the marriage , she had seethed under the insult she had received , but she had kept herself constantly informed about sofia and knew all about her sad plight , her sickness , and the outrageous situation in which she was caught . when she heard these things , she would comment to her lady companions : it serves her right .
god is making her pay for her ingratitude .
exactly three months after sofia ’ s death , the general ’ s widow suddenly appeared in our town , going straight to mr. karamazov ’ s house .
altogether , she spent only half an hour in town , but the amount she accomplished in that short time was amazing . when she arrived late in the afternoon , fyodor karamazov , whom she had not seen for eight years , came out to meet her in a rather besotted state .
without a word of explanation , she stepped up to him and slapped him , landing two mighty , resounding smacks on his face ; then she caught him by the forelock , pulling it hard three times . then , still without explanation , she went to gregory ’ s cottage where she found the two little boys .
she announced that she was taking the boys away with her and , leading them out just as they were , in their dirty shirts , sat them in her carriage , wrapped them in carriage rugs , and drove away to her own town .
gregory took the slap slavishly , without a word of recrimination , and as he saw the lady off to her carriage , he bowed deeply from the waist , solemnly pronouncing that the lord would reward her for taking the orphans .
and you ’ re a blockhead all the same , the old lady shouted at him as the carriage drove off .
later , after he had thought it over , karamazov decided that it was all in his best interest and he made no difficulties when the general ’ s widow asked his formal consent to her taking charge of the boys ’ education . as to the slaps he had received , he dashed all around the town , telling everyone about the incident himself .
when the general ’ s widow died not long after , she bequeathed a thousand rubles to each boy to be spent exclusively on his education , but sparingly , so that it should last until their coming of age . she added that this sum was more than adequate for children of such a background , but that if anyone felt it was not , let him untie his own purse strings , and so on and so forth .
i didn ’ t read her will myself , but i understand that it was something along these lines , eccentric and very strangely worded .
however , the old woman ’ s principal heir , the marshal of nobility of the province , efim petrovich polenov , turned out to be an extremely honorable man .
he informed fyodor karamazov of the will but realized immediately that such a man would never contribute a kopek to the education of his own children ( although karamazov never refused directly , he always found reasons for delaying his contribution , occasionally even spouting sentimentalities ) .
so polenov decided to take care of the abandoned boys himself , and he grew quite fond of them , particularly of the younger , alexei , who lived for a long time in his house as one of the family . it must be noted right here that if the young karamazovs were indebted to anyone for their upbringing and education , it was above all to this mr. polenov , one of the most generous and honorable men to be found . he kept intact the original thousand left to each boy by the general ’ s widow so that , when they came of age , each of them would receive two thousand rubles , thanks to the accumulated interest .
polenov paid for their upkeep and education out of his own pocket , spending , incidentally , considerably more than a thousand rubles on each boy .
again , i won ’ t give a lengthy account of their childhood and school years , but will only outline the most important facts . of the elder , ivan , i will only say that he grew into a sullen and secretive boy , although by no means a timorous one . i gather that by the time he was ten or so he had become aware that he and his brother were not being brought up in their own home but were , in fact , living on other people ’ s charity , and that there was something about their father that made the very mention of his name a cause for embarrassment .
very early in life , almost in infancy ( at least so some people claimed ) , the boy started to display an uncanny aptitude for learning .
i don ’ t know exactly how it came to pass , but when he was barely thirteen he left polenov ’ s family , being sent to a secondary school in moscow , where he boarded at the house of a celebrated and experienced educator , a boyhood friend of polenov ’ s . later , ivan karamazov liked to say that he had been sent to moscow thanks to mr. polenov ’ s zeal for good works , because polenov had been carried away by the idea that a boy endowed with a genius for learning should be taught by a teacher of genius . however , neither mr. polenov nor the brilliant educator was alive by the time ivan entered the university .
and since polenov had somehow neglected to make the proper arrangements to cut through the usual russian red tape and make the bequests ( now worth more than two thousand rubles each ) quickly available to the boys , ivan could not get the money and had to earn his own living during his first two years at the university .
in any case , the young man did not despair and quickly found work—first tutoring at a few kopeks an hour , then making the rounds of the editorial offices of newspapers , peddling ten-line news items on street incidents or the like that he signed eyewitness . i gather that these items were so originally and strikingly presented that the newspapers were glad to run them . this in itself goes to show the young man ’ s superiority in practical and intellectual matters over the crowd of needy students of both sexes , who night and day swarm through the offices of the moscow and petersburg newspapers and magazines , unable to think up anything more original than to beg for translations from the french or for odd copying jobs .
once ivan karamazov got to know people on the editorial staffs , he kept in touch with them , so that during his last years at the university he was able to publish reviews of books on a variety of specialized subjects , in which he showed considerable talent ; thus he gradually gained a good reputation in literary circles .
however , it was not until quite recently that he succeeded in attracting the attention of a wider circle of readers , and it was one particular incident that made them notice and remember him—and a rather curious incident at that . ivan karamazov had been graduated from the university , had collected his two thousand rubles , and was planning to take a trip abroad , when one of the major newspapers carried a very strange article of his that caught the interest even of non-specialists . the most remarkable thing about it was that the topic seemed to be quite outside ivan ’ s field , since he had specialized in the natural sciences .
the article was devoted to a problem much discussed at the time—the ecclesiastical courts . after examining various opinions that had already been expressed on the subject , ivan presented his own views . the impact was due mostly to the tone and to the unexpectedness of the conclusions .
then , not only secularists but even outright atheists joined in the applause . finally , however , some perspicacious persons decided that the whole article was a hoax , an insolent joke he had played on them all .
i have mentioned this incident because the article and the argument it stirred up even reached our famous monastery , where the matter of the ecclesiastical courts elicited great interest .
they were perplexed by it , and when they noticed the signature under it , their interest increased even further , since the author happened to be a native of our part of the country and a son of that fyodor karamazov . then , in the midst of it all , the author himself suddenly appeared in our town .
i remember the uneasiness that question stirred in me at the time .
this fateful visit of his , which was to trigger off a whole chain of events , remained unclear to me almost to the end .
in general , it was strange that such a cultured , proud , and apparently prudent young man as ivan should come to that scandalous house to join a father who had ignored him all his life , who didn ’ t know him , indeed , hardly remembered that he existed , a father who would most certainly have refused to give him money under any circumstances and who lived in constant dread lest either of his younger sons , ivan or alexei , should one day come and ask him for help . yet the young man came and installed himself in his father ’ s house . he spent one month there , then another , and the two of them seemed to live in perfect agreement .
i was not the only one who was surprised ; many others wondered about it too .
peter miusov , the cousin of karamazov ’ s first wife whom i mentioned earlier , happened to have returned just then from paris , where he had settled for good , and was staying on his estate just outside our town .
i remember that he was the most puzzled of all , once he had made the acquaintance of the young man , who interested him a great deal and with whom he used to exchange sophisticated barbs , although his feelings were often secretly hurt when he was bested in these confrontations .
why , even now he has enough to go abroad . so what can be his motive for coming here ? he certainly didn ’ t come in the hope of getting money out of his father , for it is obvious that nothing in the world would make his father give him any .
nor does he go in for wine and debauchery , and yet old karamazov seems unable to take a step without him . in fact , i ’ ve never seen two men get along so famously ! and they did .
moreover , the young man exercised an obvious influence on his father , who sometimes almost seemed as if he would heed his advice . although he was often his nasty , unbridled self still , his behavior began to improve slightly .
it was only later that we learned that ivan had come , at least partly , at the request of his older brother dmitry , whom he also met and got to know for the first time during this visit to our town .
the two brothers had been corresponding before on an important matter that concerned dmitry more than ivan .
what it was the reader will learn at great length in good time .
let me add that ivan seemed to act as a mediator between his father and his brother dmitry , who by then had completely broken off relations , dmitry even instituting legal proceedings against the old man .
i must emphasize here that this was the very first meeting of the karamazovs , the first time that some members of that strange family had set eyes on each other .
now , karamazov ’ s youngest son , alexei , had been living among us for the past year and we had met him before his brothers .
it is of this brother , alexei , that i find it the most difficult to speak in this introductory part of my narrative , although it is indispensable to do so before i bring him out onto the stage of my novel . i must write an introductory piece about him too , if only to explain a point that may strike my readers as very strange , namely , that my future hero will have to wear the cassock of a novice at his very first appearance .
yes , he had been living at our monastery for a year or so and , indeed , it looked as if he were preparing to spend the rest of his life within its walls .
he was then only twenty ( his brother ivan was twenty-three and their older brother , dmitry , twenty-seven ) .
in my opinion at least , he was not even a mystic . let me tell you my opinion of him right from the start : he was just a boy who very early in life had come to love his fellow men and if he chose to enter a monastery , it was simply because at one point that course had caught his imagination and he had become convinced that it was the ideal way to escape from the darkness of the wicked world , a way that would lead him toward light and love .
this particular way had caught his attention only because he had happened to meet a man who made an overwhelming impression on him—the famous zosima , the elder of our monastery , to whom he had become attached with all the ardor of the first love kindled in his insatiable heart .
i will not deny , however , that he was already rather strange even then , because he had been strange from the cradle .
as i have already mentioned , he was just three when he lost his mother , yet he always remembered how she looked and how she caressed him—just as if she were standing alive before me , he would say . such memories can be preserved ( as everyone knows ) from an even earlier age , even in a two-year-old , but they are like bright spots standing out in the darkness , a tiny lighted fragment of a huge canvas , while the rest of the painting remains faded and dark .
he remembered a certain evening—a quiet , summer evening , an open window , the slanting rays of the setting sun ( the slanting rays were the clearest part of his recollection ) , an icon with a lighted lamp in a corner of the room , and , kneeling before the icon , his mother , sobbing hysterically , screaming and shrieking , clutching him with both hands so tightly that it hurt , praying to the mother of god for him , then holding him away from her toward the icon , as if putting him under the protection of the mother of god .
then , all of a sudden a nanny rushes into the room and snatches him away from his mother in alarm .
alyosha always remembered the way his mother ’ s face had looked at that second ; he described it as both frenzied and beautiful .
but he rarely confided this recollection , and to very few people .
as a child and as a boy , alyosha was rather reserved , one might even say uncommunicative .
he was not distrustful , however , or shy and unsociable , just the opposite , in fact .
his apparently distant behavior was due to a constant inner preoccupation with something strictly personal , something which had nothing to do with other people , but which was so supremely important to him that it made him forget the rest of the world . but he certainly loved people : throughout his life he seemed to believe in people and trust them , and yet no one ever thought him simple-minded or naive . there was something in him ( and it stayed with him all his life ) that made people realize that he refused to sit in judgment on others , that he felt he had no right to , and that , whatever happened , he would never condemn anyone .
he gave the impression that he could witness anything without feeling in the least outraged , although he might be deeply saddened . indeed , even when he was still very young , he reached a point where nothing either shocked or horrified him . so when , at the age of nineteen , chaste and pure , he was faced with the shocking debauchery in his father ’ s house , he would walk away in silence when things became too revolting , but never show the slightest sign of scorn or condemnation .
his father , because earlier in life he had scrounged off other people , had developed a special sensitivity to people ’ s attitudes and was prepared to interpret anything as a personal slur .
yet it was obvious that the old man had come to love his son deeply and sincerely ; in fact , his feelings for alyosha were such as a man like him could never have expected to have for anyone . but then , everybody liked the boy , wherever he went , from his early childhood on . when he found himself in the house of mr. polenov , his guardian and benefactor , the whole household became attached to him as if he were one of the family .
the gift of making people love him was inherent in him ; he gained people ’ s affection directly and effortlessly ; it was part of his nature . and it was the same at school , although one would have thought him the kind of boy to provoke distrust in his comrades , to become the target of their jokes and sometimes even of their hatred .
for instance , he would often become absorbed in his thoughts and , as it were , withdraw from the world . even as a very small boy , he would go off into a quiet corner and read a book . and yet his schoolfellows liked him so much that it can be said that he was the most popular boy in the school all the time he was there .
he was seldom playful or , for that matter , even merry , but a look at him was sufficient to see that there was nothing sullen about him , that on the contrary he was a bright , good-tempered boy . and he never tried to show off to the other boys , perhaps because he was never afraid of anyone . yet the boys felt right away that he was in no way proud of his fearlessness , that it never even occurred to him that he was fearless or bold .
an hour later , he would answer the offender or speak to him himself , with a trustful , friendly look , as if nothing had happened .
and it wasn ’ t that he had forgotten or , having thought it over , had decided to forgive the insult ; it was simply that he no longer felt offended . it was this trait that won all the boys over to him and made them love him . he had , however , one peculiarity that , throughout his school years , incited his comrades to tease him , not because they were mean but just because they found it funny : this was a fierce , frantic modesty and chastity .
he could not bear to hear dirty words or a certain type of talk about women .
unfortunately , though , such words and such talk are inevitable at school . boys pure at heart , mere children , often whisper in class or even say certain things aloud and describe certain scenes that even soldiers would hesitate to mention . for one thing , there is much that soldiers do not know or understand that is quite familiar to very young boys in our intellectual and upper classes .
in this there can hardly be moral depravity or perverted inner cynicism as yet , but there is that outward cynicism which they consider truly refined and subtle , something daring and worthy of emulation .
when the other boys realized that alyosha karamazov stopped up his ears as soon as they started talking about those things , they would crowd around him , tear his hands away , and scream obscenities into his ears , while alyosha tried to break away , throwing himself onto the ground , trying desperately to cover his ears with his hands , struggling without a word , bearing it all in complete silence .
in the end , however , they left him in peace and stopped calling him little girl , at most feeling a little sorry for him for being so peculiar in that respect .
i must mention , by the way , that although academically alyosha was always among the top students , he was never actually the first in his class .
when polenov died , alyosha still had two years to go at the secondary school of our province .
very shortly after losing her husband , the inconsolable widow took all her daughters ( they had no sons ) on a long trip to italy , sending alyosha to live with two ladies who were distant relatives of mr. polenov ’ s . alyosha , who had never seen them before , did not know what the financial arrangements were .
this was another trait that was very characteristic of him—he never cared whose money he lived on . in this respect , he was a striking contrast to his brother ivan , who worked hard to support himself during his first two years at the university rather than ask for help , and who had been painfully aware , ever since his childhood , of living on the charity of strangers .
i do not think alyosha should be judged too severely on this account , however , for he was quite obviously one of those child-like , saintly creatures , who , if he were suddenly to come into a large fortune , would think nothing of giving it all away to some good cause , or simply to the first clever rascal who asked for it .
in general , he did not seem to know the value of money . i do not mean that literally of course , but when he was given pocket money ( for which he never asked ) , he either kept it for weeks on end without knowing what to do with it , or spent it at once on anything .
alyosha , miusov declared , may be the only man in the world who , if left all by himself in the middle of a strange city inhabited by a million unknown people , would never suffer from cold or hunger . for he would immediately be offered food and shelter ; and if no one offered him anything , he would find everything he needed right away himself , and it would cost him no effort , nor make him feel in the least humiliated , nor , for that matter , would he be imposing himself on others ; just the contrary , they would all be only too happy to do things for him .
alyosha did not finish school . when he was still a year away from graduation he told the ladies he lived with that he had to go and see his father to discuss an idea that had occurred to him .
the two ladies , who were sorry to lose him , tried in vain to persuade him to stay .
since it was not an expensive journey , he planned to pay for it by pawning his watch , a parting gift from mrs. polenov , but the two ladies wouldn ’ t hear of it .
alyosha , however , returned half the money , assuring them that he preferred to travel third class .
when he first arrived in our town , his father questioned him suspiciously , trying to find out just what had brought him here before he had finished school .
instead of answering , alyosha plunged into his private thoughts , as he so often did . it soon became clear that he was seeking his mother ’ s grave , and he himself practically confirmed that this had been his real reason for coming .
but it can hardly have been the only reason . most likely , at that time he did not really know himself why he had come , not being quite sure what it was that was driving him : a peculiar yearning had arisen in his heart , drawing him irresistibly into a new , unknown , but by then inevitable course .
mr. karamazov was unable to show his son where he had buried his second wife for , once the coffin had been lowered into the earth , he had never returned to visit her grave and , since that had been many years before , he had entirely forgotten where the grave was . moreover , mr. karamazov had been away from our town for a long time .
three or four years after his second wife ’ s death , he had gone to the south of russia , ending up in odessa where he stayed for several years .
there he came across lots of yids of all shapes and sizes , as he put it , and even got to know not only yids but respectable jews as well . it was probably during this period of his life that he developed a special knack for making money and holding on to it .
he had returned to our town to stay only about three years before alyosha came . those who had known him before found him terribly aged , although he was still by no means an old man .
his behavior was somehow different , too : it wasn ’ t that he ’ d become more dignified , but he was more self-assured , even insolent .
this former buffoon , for instance , now took an impudent delight in making buffoons of others . but his depravity with women was as bad as ever , if anything , worse .
it looked as if he was worth a hundred thousand rubles or close to it .
many people in town and throughout the district started borrowing money from him , on good security , of course .
of late , however , he had looked rather bloated and seemed to be losing his hold on himself .
he had even slipped into a sort of light-headedness .
he was unable to keep his mind on any one thing , but would skip off onto something else .
he would become confused , and more and more often he drank himself into a stupor .
if it hadn ’ t been for that same servant gregory , who looked after him almost like a nanny , and who had also aged considerably , karamazov might not even have survived .
alyosha ’ s arrival seemed to restore some of his mental vigor , and even to stir up a scrap of decency that had been buried somewhere in this prematurely aged man .
you know what ?
i know , i know , just the shadows of hooks .
and how do you know , my dear boy , that there are no hooks ?
we ’ ll see what tune you sing after you ’ ve spent a while with those monks .
still , while you ’ re there , try to find out the truth , and when you do , come and tell me what ’ s what .
besides , it will be more seemly for you to live in the monastery than to stay here with an old drunkard like me , and with all these sluts , though nothing could sully you , clean angel that you are .
well , i trust there ’ ll be nothing to sully you there either and that ’ s why i ’ m letting you go .
why , devils haven ’ t eaten your brains , after all , and if you ’ re all afire to go there now , it ’ ll burn off in good time , cool off .
you ’ ll get over it and come back to me .
and i ’ ll be waiting for you here , because i know you ’ re the only person on earth who hasn ’ t condemned me—i feel it . i can ’ t help feeling it !
and he even wept .
he was sentimental .
he was wicked and sentimental .
the reader may imagine , perhaps , that my young man was sickly , exalted , a poor physical specimen , an undersized , puny , pale , and consumptive dreamer .
just the opposite was true : alyosha was then the picture of health , a sturdy , red-cheeked , clear-eyed nineteen-year-old boy .
he was very handsome , too , and slender , above average height , with dark-brown hair , a regular although rather long face , and shiny dark-gray wide-set eyes , which gave him a thoughtful and serene look .
of course , nothing prevents a mystic or a fanatic from having red cheeks .
but be that as it may , i think alyosha was more of a realist than anyone i know .
of course , when he was in the monastery he believed entirely in miracles , but i don ’ t think that miracles ever confound a realist .
nor is it miracles that bring a realist to religion .
if he is an unbeliever , a true realist will always find the strength and ability not to believe in a miracle , and if he is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact , he will rather disbelieve his own senses than accept that fact .
or he may concede the fact and explain it away as a natural phenomenon until then unknown .
in a realist , it is not miracles that generate faith , but faith that generates miracles .
once a realist becomes a believer , however , his very realism will make him accept the existence of miracles .
the apostle thomas said he would not believe until he saw , and when he saw , he said : my lord and my god !
was it a miracle that made him believe ?
he believed only because he wanted to believe , and possibly he already believed in the secret recesses of his being while he was saying , except i shall see , i will not believe .
some may say that alyosha was not too bright , rather uneducated , had not even finished school , and so on .
it is true that he had not finished school , but it would be doing him a great injustice to say that he was obtuse or stupid .
i shall simply repeat here what i have said before : he chose the course he did only because it struck him at that particular moment as the ideal course for his soul , which longed to escape from darkness into light .
it must be added that , in a way , he was indeed a member of our younger generation , which means that he was honest , that he believed in , demanded , and searched for truth ; that , because he believed in it , he yearned to serve it and give it his whole strength ; he was spoiling for immediate action , was prepared to sacrifice everything , his life itself , in an act of supreme devotion . unfortunately , these young men often fail to understand that the sacrifice of their lives may be the easiest of all sacrifices , much easier , for instance , than giving up five or six years of their seething youth to hard study , to the acquisition of knowledge which would increase their strength tenfold in the service of that same cause , and in the performance of the great works they aspire to .
alyosha chose a course opposite to that of the majority , although he felt the same yearning for action and sacrifice as the others .
once , having given it serious thought , he had become convinced of the existence of god and immortality , it was natural for him to say to himself : i want to live to achieve immortality and will accept no compromise .
if by chance he had become convinced that god and immortality did not exist , he would immediately have joined the ranks of the atheists and socialists ( for socialism is not just a question of labor organization ; it is above all an atheistic phenomenon , the modern manifestation of atheism , one more tower of babel built without god , not in order to reach out toward heaven from earth , but to bring heaven down to earth ) .
once he had decided , alyosha would have félt it strange , even impossible , to go on living as he had been .
it is written : if thou wouldst be perfect , go and give up all that thou hast and come and follow me .
so alyosha said to himself : i can not very well just give up a couple of rubles , instead of all that i have , or , instead of obeying the lord ’ s follow me , just attend church .
perhaps there lingered in his mind some early memory of our monastery , to which his mother may have taken him to attend mass .
or perhaps his decision was somehow connected with the slanting rays of the setting sun on the icon before which his crazy mother had held him .
when he first arrived , alyosha had seemed to be pondering deeply about something , perhaps trying to decide whether he would be able to give up all or only a couple of rubles .
this was the elder zosima whom i mentioned earlier . but before i proceed , i should try to explain what an elder in our monasteries is .
first of all , according to the experts , the institution of elder came into existence in our russian monasteries only quite recently , less than a hundred years ago , although it has existed for well over a thousand years throughout the orthodox east , particularly in sinai and on mount athos .
as i understand it , in olden times there were probably elders in russia too , but as the country went through a series of calamities—the tartar invasion , civil wars , and isolation from the orthodox east after the fall of constantinople—the institution fell into disuse and the elders vanished from our monasteries .
they were reintroduced in russia toward the end of the eighteenth century by the great ascetic ( as he was called ) paisii velichkovsky and his followers , but to this day , almost a hundred years later , elders are found in only a very few monasteries and they have occasionally been subjected to persecution as an un-russian innovation .
the institution of elder especially flourished in the famous kozelskaya optina monastery .
who introduced it into our monastery and when i can not say . i only know that there had already been three elders , zosima being the third .
but he was weak and sick and obviously did not have long to live , and no one knew where another would be found to take his place .
this was a crucial problem for our monastery because it had not previously been renowned for anything in particular : it had no saints ’ relics , no miracle-working icons , nor even any glorious traditions connected with the history of russia .
it was only thanks to its elders that it had flourished and its fame spread all over russia ; it was to see and hear our elders that pilgrims from every corner of the country traveled thousands of miles to flock to the monastery .
what precisely is an elder , then ?
an elder is a man who takes your soul and your will into his soul and his will .
once you have chosen your elder , you renounce your own will , you yield it to him in total submission and self-renunciation .
a man who consents to this ordeal , to this terrible apprenticeship , is willing to bear it in the hope that , after a long period of trial , he will conquer himself and achieve a self-mastery that will enable him to finally attain , through a whole life of obedience , complete freedom ( that is , freedom from himself ) and thus avoid the fate of those who reach the end of their lives without ever having found themselves within themselves .
the institution of elder is not an invention based on theory but evolved in the east in more than a thousand years of practice .
the obligations a man contracts toward an elder are quite different from the usual obedience , such as has always existed in russian monasteries .
once accepted by an elder , a disciple must live a life of continual confession , and the bond between the two is indissoluble .
once in the early days of christianity , according to legend , a novice failed to carry out a command imposed on him by his elder and , instead , left his monastery in syria and went to egypt .
there , after many heroic acts of self-abnegation , he underwent torture and died a martyr for his faith .
yet when before burial his coffin stood in a church where he was already venerated as a saint , a strange thing happened : as soon as the deacon began to intone , depart , all ye possessed by the devil , the coffin rose into the air and was hurled out of the church .
and this was repeated three times .
it was only then that they learned that this saint had broken his vow of obedience to his elder and so , despite his great exploits , had to be pardoned by his elder before he could receive christian burial .
one of our russian monks , seeking salvation on mount athos , was suddenly ordered by his elder to leave mount athos , a holy place which he loved and where he had found a peaceful haven for his soul , and first to go on a pilgrimage to jerusalem to worship at the holy shrines , then to return to russia and go north to siberia , because , the elder told him , your place is there and not here .
stunned and filled with despair , the monk went to constantinople , where he begged the ecumenical patriarch to release him from his vow of obedience ; but the patriarch explained that neither he nor any power on earth could ever release him from his vow of obedience , and that only the elder who had imposed the command had the power to rescind it .
thus , in some ways , elders exercise an authority that is boundless beyond understanding . that is why the institution of elder was at first opposed , even condemned , in russian monasteries .
the common people , however , showed tremendous respect for the elders right away . and soon the uneducated and the humble , the rich and the mighty , were flocking from all over russia to see the elders of our monastery , to throw themselves at their feet , to confess their sins , to confide their doubts and torments , to seek guidance and advice .
this caused the opponents of the elders to accuse them , among other things , of arbitrarily and irresponsibly degrading the sacrament of confession , although the continual baring of a novice ’ s or a layman ’ s soul before his elder was quite different from that sacrament .
the institution survived , however , and it is now gradually becoming more common in russian monasteries .
it is also true , though , that this well-tested , thousand-year-old method of spiritual regeneration from slavery to freedom and moral perfection may prove to be a double-edged weapon , for some men , instead of gaining humility and ultimate self-mastery , may acquire the most satanic pride , so that they are fettered rather than free .
the elder , zosima , was about sixty-five . he came from a family of landed gentry , and as a very young man he had been in the army , serving as an officer in the caucasus .
there was a special spiritual quality about him that must have struck alyosha . for his part , the elder also grew very fond of the boy and allowed him to share his cell .
it must be pointed out that , when he was living at the monastery , alyosha was not yet bound by any vow , so that he could come and go as he pleased ; indeed , he could stay away for days on end whenever he wished , and if he wore a cassock it was by his own choice , so as not to stand out among the others—though he obviously also liked wearing a cassock .
it is also quite possible that alyosha ’ s youthful imagination was greatly stirred by zosima ’ s spiritual power and the fame that surrounded him .
many said of the elder that , in accepting all those who had come throughout the years to entrust their souls to him , to seek his guidance and solace , he had heard so many confessions , secrets , and tales of human despair that he had finally acquired an insight so keen that he could guess , from the very first glance at a newcomer , what he would say , what he would ask him , and even what was really tormenting his conscience . often the visitor was surprised , confounded , and even frightened on finding that the elder knew his secret before he had even uttered a word .
alyosha also noticed that almost all who came to zosima for the first time were filled with fear and apprehension as they entered the cell to face him alone , but that almost without exception they left smiling and serene ; even the gloomiest faces emerged beaming with joy .
alyosha noted with particular interest that the elder zosima was in no way severe , but , if anything , was always rather cheerful .
the monks said that he was particularly warm toward the worst sinners and that the greater a man ’ s sins the greater was the elder ’ s love for him .
even toward the end of zosima ’ s life , there were monks who hated and envied him , but there were fewer and fewer of them , and they kept their feelings to themselves , although some occupied important positions in the monastery . such was one of the oldest monks , a man famous for the strictness of his fasts and for his long periods of silence .
but without doubt the overwhelming majority of the monks were on zosima ’ s side , and many of them loved him deeply and sincerely .
some were almost fanatically devoted to him and said , although not quite openly , that zosima was a saint , that there could be no doubt about it . and , as his end was drawing near , they expected it to be followed almost at once by miracles that would shortly bring even greater glory to the monastery .
alyosha was one of those who had unquestioning faith in zosima ’ s miraculous powers , as unquestioning as his acceptance of the story about the coffin that flew out of church by itself .
he saw many who came with sick children or relatives to beg the elder to lay his hands on them and pray for them , and who returned , some the very next day , and , the tears running down their cheeks , prostrated themselves before the elder , thanking him for healing the sick .
the question of whether this was miraculous healing or natural recovery never even occurred to alyosha , for he had complete faith in the spiritual power of his teacher , whose glory he felt as his own personal triumph .
he felt a special tremor in his heart and he radiated joy when the elder went out to the gates of the monastery to meet a group of humble folk who had flocked there from all over russia to see him and ask for his blessing . they prostrated themselves before him , wept , kissed his feet and the earth on which he stood ; wailing peasant women held up their children and led sick and hysterical village girls to him .
the elder spoke to them , said a short prayer , blessed them , and sent them away in peace . later , though , he was so weak after his bouts of illness that he hardly had the strength to leave his cell , and there were times when pilgrims had to wait several days for him to appear .
alyosha never felt the least surprise that all these people should love the elder , that they should prostrate themselves before him , weeping with emotion at the mere sight of his face .
oh , he understood very well that for the meek soul of a simple russian , exhausted by grief and hardship and , above all , by constant injustice and sin , his own or the world ’ s , there was no stronger need than to find a holy shrine or a saint to prostrate himself before and to worship .
even though sin and injustice and temptation are all around us , we know that there is on this earth a holy man , a saint who is just and knows the truth , and this means that truth and justice have not vanished from the earth and so will come to us too and rule over all the world , as has been promised .
this , he knew with his reason , but that zosima was such a saint , a guardian of divine justice—that was something alyosha never doubted , something that he felt spontaneously , like all the weeping peasants and the sick women who held their children up to the elder .
and the conviction that , after his death , zosima would confer great glory on the monastery was , perhaps , stronger in alyosha than in anyone else at the monastery .
indeed , a strange , profound , overwhelming ecstasy had burned in him more and more powerfully of late .
then all men will be saints and will love one another , and there will be no poor and no rich , no mighty and no humiliated—all will be the children of god and the true kingdom of christ will come .
this is what alyosha felt in his heart .
the arrival of his brothers , whom , before this , he had not known at all , seemed to make a tremendous impression on alyosha .
he got to know his half brother dmitry more quickly than his brother ivan and felt closer to him , although dmitry arrived later . alyosha was very eager to get to know ivan , but although his brother had been in town for two whole months and they saw each other quite often , they still seemed unable to really make friends . alyosha himself was silent and reserved ; he seemed a little embarrassed and as if he were expecting something from his brother , and ivan , although at first alyosha felt his long and scrutinizing looks resting upon him , soon appeared to lose all interest in him .
alyosha , who was rather taken aback by this change , ascribed his brother ’ s distant attitude to the difference in their ages and , above all , in their education .
but at times he also suspected that ivan ’ s lack of interest and sympathy might be due to other causes about which he knew nothing . he somehow felt that ivan was absorbed in something within himself , something very important , that he was pursuing some goal , perhaps a very difficult goal , which simply left no room for alyosha in his thoughts , and that this explained why he looked at him so absentmindedly . alyosha also wondered whether the cultured atheist might not feel some contempt for a silly novice .
he knew very well that his brother was an atheist and could not possibly take offense at his brother ’ s contempt , if contempt there was ; yet he was in a state of acute discomfort , for which he himself could not account , as he waited for his brother to deign to come closer to him . dmitry , the oldest brother , showed tremendous respect for ivan and spoke of him with strange emotion .
it was from dmitry that alyosha learned the details of the important matters that had linked the two older brothers so closely and so strangely . dmitry ’ s enthusiastic admiration for ivan struck alyosha even more forcefully since , compared with ivan , he was almost entirely uneducated , and the two offered such a remarkable contrast in character and personality that it was hard to imagine two men more unlike .
it was at this time that a meeting , or shall we call it a gathering , of the members of this ill-assorted family took place in the elder ’ s cell , a gathering that was to deeply affect alyosha .
by then , the dispute between dmitry karamazov and his father over the inheritance and their financial dealings had reached an impasse , and their relations had become untenable .
mr. karamazov seems to have first suggested , and that in a jocular tone , that all the karamazovs gather in the elder ’ s cell ; without asking for zosima ’ s direct arbitration , he felt , they could still discuss the matter more decently in the venerable presence of the elder , which might inspire respect and have a reconciliatory effect on them .
dmitry , who had never visited the elder , indeed had never set eyes on him , thought that zosima was being used to intimidate him ; but , since he secretly felt a little guilty about some of the things he had said to his father during their arguments , he accepted the challenge .
( it must be noted that , unlike ivan , dmitry was not living with his father , but was staying in a house at the opposite end of town . ) peter miusov , who was in town , turned out to be particularly eager that mr. karamazov ’ s suggestion should be taken up . a typical liberal of the ’ s and ’ s , this free-thinker and atheist took a very active interest in the business , perhaps out of boredom or perhaps just to have a little light-hearted fun .
he was suddenly eager to have a look at the monastery and at that holy man .
his lawsuit against the monastery was still dragging on and his claims over the property boundaries and the fishing and wood-cutting rights were still unsettled , so he announced that he wished to see the father superior to try and reach an amicable settlement with him .
he obviously felt that a man visiting the monastery with such laudable intentions would be received and treated with much greater consideration than an ordinary visitor who had come out of mere curiosity . he thought all these considerations might bring pressure to bear upon the elder from within the monastery . because of his sickness , the elder had hardly left his cell at all of late and he had been unable to see even his regular visitors .
in the end , however , he consented to receive them , and the day was fixed .
i wonder who has set me up as judge over them , was all he said , smiling at alyosha .
when alyosha first heard of the planned gathering , he was very perturbed .
he realized that , of all the contending parties , only dmitry would take the whole thing seriously , while the others would come to the meeting out of motives that were frivolous and perhaps insulting to the elder .
ivan and miusov would come out of curiosity , perhaps of the crudest sort , and his father might very easily be planning some piece of buffoonery which would turn the whole thing into a farce .
oh , although he did not talk much , alyosha knew his father well , for , i must repeat , he was not at all the uncomplicated lad that many people supposed .
so it was with a heavy heart that he awaited the day . he was , of course , very anxious that the quarrels within his family should be brought to an end , but he was even more concerned about the elder . he was full of anxiety for him , for his reputation , and , as he imagined the meeting to himself beforehand , he particularly feared miusov ’ s subtle and urbane sarcasms and the learned ivan ’ s haughty insinuations .
he even thought of warning the elder about these visitors , but he decided not to and kept silent . he only sent dmitry word the day before , through a friend , that he was very fond of him and expected him to keep his promise . dmitry was puzzled , for he could not think what he had promised alyosha , but he answered by letter that he would do his best not to lose his temper in the event of some despicable trick and that , although he had great respect for the elder and for ivan , he felt certain that some trap was being laid for him or that the whole thing was a farce .
nevertheless , i ’ ll swallow my tongue rather than offend the venerable old man whom you respect so highly , he said in concluding the letter .
alyosha hardly found this reassuring .
it was a beautiful , clear , warm day in late august .
the elder was to receive them at about half-past eleven , immediately after late mass .
our visitors did not attend the service , but arrived just as it was over .
the first , an elegant barouche drawn by two fine horses , brought peter miusov and a distant relative , peter kalganov . he was a young man of twenty or so , who was preparing to enter the university , but miusov , with whom , for some reason , he was living for the moment , was trying to persuade him to accompany him abroad , to attend the university in either zurich or jena and obtain his degree there .
he seemed absorbed in his thoughts and rather absentminded .
he had a pleasant face , was well built and quite tall .
at times , there was a strange fixity in his gaze : like all absent-minded people , he would often stare at you for a long time without seeing you .
he was silent and rather awkward , but sometimes when he was alone with another person , he would suddenly become talkative , effusive , and was liable to burst out laughing quite unaccountably .
he always dressed well , indeed with studied elegance . he had an independent income even then , and had even more sizable expectations .
the second carriage , a jolting but roomy old hired carriage , which was drawn by a pair of sedate , pinkish-gray horses and which kept falling behind miusov ’ s barouche , brought mr. karamazov and his son ivan .
as to dmitry , he was late , although he had been informed in advance of the day and the time they were to meet .
the visitors left their carriages outside the monastery wall , near an inn , and entered the gates on foot .
i do not believe any of them , except mr. karamazov , had ever been in a monastery before , and , as to miusov , it is unlikely that he had seen the inside even of a church for a good thirty years .
he looked around him with a certain curiosity , trying nevertheless to appear quite casual about it all .
but there was nothing there to interest a man of his mentality , except perhaps the architecture of the church and the buildings where the monks lived , though even they were quite ordinary .
the last of the worshippers were coming out of church , bare-headed and crossing themselves .
among the simple people there were a few better-class people—two or three ladies and a very old general , all of whom were staying at the nearby inn .
beggars surrounded our visitors as soon as they appeared , but nobody gave them anything , except for young kalganov who dug a ten-kopek piece out of his purse and , for some reason looking very embarrassed , pushed it hurriedly into one woman ’ s hand , muttering something like to share among you .
none of his companions commented on his act , so there seemed no reason for further embarrassment , but when he became aware of it , he grew even more confused .
it was rather strange , though ; there really should have been someone to receive them , and perhaps even with some esteem : one of them had just recently donated a thousand rubles to the monastery and another was one of the wealthiest landowners in the district ; he was considered one of the best-educated of men , and his decision about the fishing rights on the river could determine the whole course of the litigation . but none of the monastery officials came out to meet them .
miusov gazed abstractedly at the graves in the churchyard and was about to remark that the dead had to pay a very high price for the privilege of being buried in this holy place , but he let it pass , for his usual ironic liberal tone was turning into something like anger . damn it , isn ’ t there anyone to direct us in this chaos ?
he muttered as if talking to himself .
then , all of a sudden a middle-aged , balding gentleman in a loose summer coat walked up to them . he raised his hat and , looking at them ingratiatingly , introduced himself to the whole party in a mellifluous voice .
the elder zosima lives in the hermitage , he lisped .
it ’ s about four hundred yards from the monastery on the other side of that little wood over there .
the only trouble is , we don ’ t quite remember the way—we haven ’ t been here for a long time .
well , you can go through that gate over there and then straight through the wood , straight through .
it ’ s this way , please .
they went through the gate and crossed the little wood with maximov , a man of about sixty , trotting along beside them and examining them with an almost morbid curiosity , his eyes almost starting from his head .
you see , we ’ ve come here on private business , miusov said sternly .
we have been granted what we may call an audience ’ by the person in question and , therefore , grateful though we are to you for showing us the way , we won ’ t be able to invite you to come in with us .
un chevalier parfait !
who is a chevalier ?
that elder is the pride and glory of the monastery .
but his incoherent speech was cut short by a small , cowled monk , pale and haggard , who just then caught up with them .
as mr. karamazov and mr. miusov stopped , the monk bowed almost from the waist and said in a most courteous tone :
after your visit to the hermitage , gentlemen , the father superior invites you to dinner , if possible no later than one o ’ clock .
and then , turning to maximov , he added : and you too , sir .
i will certainly be there !
exclaimed mr. karamazov , delighted at the invitation . i wouldn ’ t miss it for anything . and let me say , we have all promised to behave properly while we ’ re here .
what about you , mr. miusov , are you coming too ?
i came here primarily to study monastery customs , after all .
the only thing that troubles me is that i ’ m here with you , mr. karamazov . but where ’ s dmitry ?
he hasn ’ t shown up yet , mr. karamazov remarked .
please thank the father superior for his invitation , then , he said to the monk . we will be there for dinner .
and i , maximov lisped , will go straight to the father superior ’ s since we ’ ve been invited . the father superior is rather busy just now , the monk said hesitatingly , but , of course , it ’ s up to you , sir .
what an awful bore that old man is , mr. miusov said as maximov trotted off , back toward the monastery .
he reminds me of von sohn , mr. karamazov announced unexpectedly .
in what way is he like von sohn ?
have you ever set eyes on von sohn ? i ’ ve seen his picture .
but i didn ’ t say they looked alike—it ’ s difficult to explain .
this man is just another von sohn .
i can tell simply by looking at him .
well , i suppose you ’ re an expert in these matters . but let me remind you of one thing , mr. karamazov : you said yourself a moment ago that we had promised to behave decently while we are here , and i ’ d like you to remember it .
i warn you—restrain yourself , for if you start playing the fool , i have absolutely no intention of allowing it to reflect on me .
you see what kind of a man he is , miusov said , turning to the monk .
i ’ m quite afraid to visit respectable people with him .
a suspicion of a smile appeared on the wan , bloodless lips of the monk , a hint of sly amusement .
this only deepened miusov ’ s frown as he thought to himself : and to hell with the lot of them—it has taken them centuries to learn to keep that imperturbable face , and underneath they ’ re nothing but a bunch of charlatans .
here is the hermitage at last , mr. karamazov announced , but the gates are shut . and he proceeded to cross himself vigorously before the saints ’ images painted above and beside the gates .
when in rome , do as the romans , he remarked .
altogether there are twenty-five saints busy saving their souls in this hermitage , staring at one another , and eating cabbage .
and the most remarkable thing about it is that not a single woman is allowed through these gates .
but then how can that be , since i ’ ve heard that the elder receives ladies ? he asked suddenly , addressing the monk .
when he ’ s well enough to receive them , the elder reaches those rooms by an inside passage , for they are outside the hermitage wall , sir .
at this moment , for instance , there ’ s a lady waiting for him there with her sick daughter . she ’ s a landowner from kharkov province , mrs. khokhlakov is her name .
i expect he must have promised to come out to her , although recently he has been so weak that he has hardly shown himself even to the poor people .
well , so there is a secret passage from the hermitage to the ladies after all !
but please , holy father , you mustn ’ t think for one moment that i ’ m implying anything—i was just wondering . but on mount athos , you may know perhaps , they keep out not only women but all creatures of the female sex—like hens , turkey hens , cows .
mr. karamazov , please !
if you go on like this , i ’ ll walk out on you , and once i ’ ve left they ’ ll turn you out too , that i can promise you .
but look at that ! karamazov suddenly exclaimed , stepping through the gate onto the hermitage grounds .
although there were no roses in the hermitage garden , there were many rare and beautiful autumn flowers that had been planted wherever there was room for them , and it was clear that they were tended by a skillful hand .
there were also flowerbeds all around the church and between the graves in the churchyard .
the elder ’ s cell was in a small wooden one-story house with a porch before the entrance , which was also surrounded by flowers .
i wonder if it was like this under the previous elder , the elder varsonofy ?
mr. karamazov asked as he walked up the front steps . i understand he didn ’ t go in for refinement and that he even had a propensity for suddenly leaping up and using his stick on persons of the female sex .
the elder varsonofy did at times seem a little strange , the monk said , but many of the stories that are told about him are nonsense .
in any case , he certainly never used a stick on anybody .
and now , gentlemen , i beg you to wait here a minute while i announce you .
for the last time , mr. karamazov , miusov warned him again hurriedly in a threatening whisper , remember your promise to behave—or i ’ ll make you pay for it !
i really can not see why you should be so excited , karamazov replied sarcastically , unless you ’ re worrying about your sins at last ?
why , they say he can tell just by a man ’ s eyes what ’ s troubling him !
and anyway , why should the opinion of these people be so important to you , a parisian and an enlightened gentleman ?
but before miusov could answer this sarcasm , they were asked to come in .
he entered feeling rather irritated .
i ’ m irritated now and i ’ ll start arguing and lose my temper .
just as they entered the cell , the elder appeared , emerging from his bedroom .
two monks from the hermitage were already waiting , the father librarian and father paisii , a sickly man who , although he was not very advanced in years , had a reputation as a great scholar . besides them , a young man of about twenty-two wearing ordinary clothes stood waiting in a corner ( where he remained standing all the time ) .
he was fairly tall , had a fair complexion , prominent cheekbones , and narrow brown eyes that were intelligent and observant .
his bearing was deferential but dignified , without the least subservience .
as if conscious of his subordinate and dependent position , of not being their equal , he did not greet the visitors .
the elder zosima entered accompanied by a novice and by alyosha .
the monks rose , greeted him with bows so deep that their fingers touched the floor , and went up to him , to kiss his hand and receive his blessing .
after he had blessed them , zosima in turn bowed just as deeply , also touching the floor with his fingers , and asked each of them for his blessing .
the whole ceremony was performed very seriously , not like some daily rite but with a real show of feeling .
miusov , however , was convinced that it was all put on to impress the visitors .
he stood in front of the party deliberating ( he had been wondering about it since the day before ) whether he should , despite his ideas , just out of courtesy ( since it was the custom here ) , step forward and ask the elder for his blessing , although he certainly would not kiss his hand . now , seeing all the bowing and hand-kissing of the monks , he made up his mind .
serious and dignified , he went up to the elder , bowed rather deeply by ordinary standards , and moved over to a chair .
mr. karamazov went through exactly the same motions , but exaggerated them , making them seem ridiculous .
ivan also bowed politely and gravely , his hands stiffly at his sides , while kalganov was so embarrassed that he didn ’ t bow at all .
the elder dropped his hand , which he had raised to bless them , bowed to them once more , and invited them to sit down .
alyosha ’ s worst forebodings were coming true ; he was ashamed and the blood rushed to his cheeks .
the elder sat down on a leather-covered mahogany sofa of antique design , while inviting his four visitors to sit on four mahogany chairs covered with badly worn black leather ranged along the opposite wall .
the two monks took chairs on either side of the room—one by the window and the other by the door—while the divinity student , alyosha , and the novice remained standing .
the whole cell was rather small and drab-looking .
it had only the most indispensable furniture , and even that was poor and crude .
there were two pots of flowers on the window sill and , in a corner , many icons , one of them a large picture of the mother of god probably painted long before the schism .
a lamp burned in front of it .
next to it were two icons in shiny settings , and beyond them some carved cherubs , little china eggs , an ivory catholic cross with a mater dolorosa with her arms around it , and a few foreign engravings , copies of the great italian masters of bygone times .
beside these costly , graceful foreign engravings were some rather crude native russian lithographs of saints and martyrs , the kind that could be bought at any local fair for a few kopeks .
on the other walls hung a few portraits of russian bishops , past and present .
miusov made a cursory inspection of all this conventional rubbish , then turned to look intently at the elder .
he rated his own powers of judgment rather highly , a weakness which was excusable in him , since he was already past fifty , an age at which an intelligent , cultured man of the world of independent means acquires an exaggerated opinion of his own judgment , sometimes despite himself .
he disliked the elder at first glance .
indeed , there was something in zosima ’ s face that many besides miusov would have disliked .
he was a short , stooped little man with very weak legs who , because of ill-health , looked at least ten years older than his sixty-five years .
his very thin face was covered with tiny wrinkles , especially around his eyes .
his eyes , small , quick , and shiny , made two bright dots in his face .
he was bald except for some thin gray hair around the temples ; his wedge-shaped beard was very small and scanty , and he had thin , thread-like lips , which formed readily into a smile .
his nose , although it was not really long , was sharp , like the beak of a small bird .
all the signs of a wicked , pettily supercilious nature . flashed through miusov ’ s head .
he was still very annoyed with himself .
a small , cheap wall clock with weights hurriedly struck twelve times , and this helped to get the conversation started .
mr. karamazov cried out . and still no sign of my son dmitry !
i apologize for him , holy elder !
the holy elder actually made alyosha shudder .
i always arrive exactly on time , knowing that punctuality is the courtesy of kings . well , whatever else you may be , you ’ re certainly no king , miusov muttered , unable to contain his irritation .
yes , that ’ s true , i ’ m no king .
i ’ ll even swear to it ! i don ’ t know why , but i always say the wrong thing !
ah , your reverence ! he exclaimed with a sudden pathos .
you have before you a buffoon , a true buffoon—that ’ s how i will introduce myself .
alas , it ’ s an old habit with me !
and if i sometimes talk nonsense , it is actually intentional , to make people laugh , to please them .
one must try to please , mustn ’ t one ?
for instance , about seven years ago , i arrived in a small town where i was trying to set up a little business deal in partnership with some small local businessmen .
of course , we had to see the local ispravnik first to ask a favor of him—you know what i mean—and invite him to dinner .
so we go there , and the ispravnik appears , and he turns out to be a big , fat fellow with blondish hair and an unsmiling face—the most dangerous type in such cases—it ’ s their livers , you see , their livers . well , i turn to him and , with the self-assurance of a man of the world , i say , mr. ispravnik , we ’ ve come to beg you to be our napravnik , if i may say so .
how ’ s that , your napravnik ?
what do you mean by that ?
i could see right away that it hadn ’ t gone over .
i was just trying to make a pun , i said , trying to cheer up the company a little .
that mr. napravnik i was referring to is one of the greatest russian conductors , and it ’ s a sort of conductor that we need for the harmony of our little enterprise .
i thought i had given him a reasonable explanation , and the comparison was to the point too , but he just said , i ’ m an ispravnik and i will not tolerate puns with reference to my official capacity .
wait , i call out to him .
you ’ re an ispravnik and not mr. napravnik .
no , he says , you can not take it back now—i am napravnik .
and , of course , our business deal fell through .
it ’ s always the same with me—i get myself into trouble by being too friendly !
once—it was many , many years ago—i said to a very important man : your wife , sir , i said , is a very ticklish lady , meaning in the sense of honor , of moral qualities , you know , and i never expected him to ask me : what do you know about it ?
have you ever tickled her ?
well , i thought it was an opening for some amiable chit-chat , so i said , why , yes , sir , i must say i have .
well , the fellow gave me quite a tickling then , too !
i can tell it now without shame because it happened so long ago but , in general , i always manage to do myself some harm that way .
like right now , for instance , miusov muttered disgustedly . the elder was looking at the two of them in silence .
well , will you believe me , mr. miusov , if i tell you i was aware of that too and , what ’ s more , as soon as i started to speak , i knew , i somehow felt , that you ’ d be the first to make some remark ?
whenever i realize , your reverence , that my joke isn ’ t succeeding , my cheeks begin to stick to my lower gums , like a sort of cramp . it ’ s happened ever since my youth when i used to be a hanger-on to the local landed gentry , earning my living by being a parasite .
i ’ m a thorough-going buffoon , a born buffoon , which is like being one of god ’ s fools , your reverence . i won ’ t deny , though , that there may be an unholy spirit in me , too , but it must be one of minor rank—if it were more important it would surely have chosen better quarters—but certainly not you , mr. miusov .
i , at least , believe in god .
and if i ’ ve had some doubts of late , they ’ re gone now as i sit here , expecting to hear words of great wisdom .
i , reverend father , am like the philosopher diderot .
you may have heard , holy father , how diderot went to see the metropolitan platon , in the time of the empress catherine .
he marched in and immediately announced : there is no god !
the holy patriarch raised his finger and replied : the fool has said in his heart , there is no god !
and the next thing , diderot was lying at his feet and wailing : i believe .
i want to be baptized !
and so he was baptized then and there , and princess dashkov acted as his godmother and potemkin as his godfather .
this is outrageous !
you know very well you ’ re talking nonsense and that stupid anecdote is quite untrue .
why must you carry on like this ?
miusov said in a shaking voice , feeling that he was losing control over himself .
all my life , i ’ ve suspected it wasn ’ t true !
karamazov cried excitedly .
and now let me tell you the whole truth , gentlemen !
forgive me , oh great elder—i made up that last bit about diderot ’ s being baptized as i was telling the story .
it had never even occurred to me till then .
i invented it to spice things up a bit . that ’ s why i ’ m carrying on , mr. miusov , to be good company , you know , although there are times when i don ’ t really know myself why i do it .
as to the diderot story , i heard the patriarch ’ s reply to him at least twenty times from the landowners in whose houses i spent my youth and , by the way , from your auntie mavra , among others , mr. miusov . to this day , they are all convinced that the atheist diderot went to see the metropolitan platon to argue with him about god .
he had not only lost patience—he didn ’ t seem to know what he was doing . he was seething with rage and was conscious that that made him ridiculous too .
indeed , something quite incredible was taking place in the cell .
until then , for forty or fifty years , the people who had been received there by the elder and his predecessors had come with a feeling of deep reverence .
everyone admitted was conscious of having been granted a great favor ; many knelt the moment they entered and remained kneeling throughout the visit . even the most learned and prominent people , including free-thinkers who came out of curiosity or for some such reason , all felt bound to behave with tact and respect as long as they were in the elder ’ s presence , whether they were received with other visitors or privately . this was especially so because there was no question of money here , but only of love and kindness , on the one hand , and , on the other , penitence or the longing to solve some spiritual problem or resolve a difficult personal crisis .
consequently , karamazov ’ s buffoonery , so disrespectful and out of place , surprised and bewildered at least some of the witnesses to the scene .
the monks , although their expressions did not change , waited tensely to hear what the elder would say , and seemed ready to leap to their feet like miusov . alyosha stood with his head bowed , looking as if he were about to burst into tears .
he was surprised , too , that his brother ivan , the only person there on whom he had relied , and the only person in the world who had an influence on his father and could have stopped him , sat motionless in his chair , his eyes lowered , apparently waiting curiously to see how it would all end , as if he himself were a complete outsider and could not possibly be affected . as to the divinity student , rakitin , whom he knew well , almost intimately , alyosha didn ’ t even dare look at him , for he knew his thoughts ( he was , indeed , the only man in the monastery to know them ) .
please forgive me , miusov said , addressing the elder . i am afraid you may think that i too have a part in this ridiculous farce . i made a mistake in thinking that even a man like fyodor karamazov would understand his obligations when received by a highly respectable person .
it never occurred to me that i would have to apologize merely for having come in his company and .
miusov , too embarrassed to go on , was about to walk out of the room . please don ’ t worry , the elder said . he stood up abruptly on his weak legs , took miusov by both hands , and made him sit down again .
karamazov cried , gripping the arms of his chair with his hands as though he would jump up if he received an unfavorable answer .
you too , sir , please be at ease and rest assured that there is nothing to worry about , the elder said in a firm tone . i want you to feel completely at home and , above all , not to be ashamed of yourself , for that is what causes all the trouble .
you mean be my natural self ? oh , that is too kind , much too kind , but i am deeply moved and i accept your invitation ! but let me warn you , blessed father , do not encourage me to be my natural self .
even i wouldn ’ t dare to let myself go entirely .
i tell you that for your own good .
as for the rest , it is still shrouded in darkness , although there are those who are only too anxious to tell all sorts of stories about me .
as for you , most holy man , allow me only to express my profound admiration ! he stood up and , raising his hands toward the ceiling , declaimed : blessed be the womb that bore thee and the paps that gave thee suck ’ —particularly the paps !
all right , i say to myself , so i ’ ll act like a buffoon . i don ’ t care what they think of me because i really believe that every one of them is even lower than i. yes , that ’ s why i ’ m a buffoon—it ’ s out of shame , as you said , great elder , out of sheer shame ! it ’ s a fact that i misbehave this way because i ’ m oversensitive .
if i could only feel that all the people i met considered me a nice , intelligent fellow , i ’ m sure i ’ d be the kindest of men !
it was hard to tell whether he was still fooling or was now really deeply moved .
the elder looked at him smilingly and said :
you have known for a long time what to do—you are intelligent enough to see it yourself : stop indulging in drunkenness and incontinence of speech , do not give way to sensual lust and particularly to your passion for money . also , close down your taverns ; if you can not close them all , close at least two or three .
and , above all , stop lying .
you mean that story i told about diderot ?
no , i didn ’ t really mean that .
the important thing is to stop lying to yourself .
a man who lies to himself , and believes his own lies , becomes unable to recognize truth , either in himself or in anyone else , and he ends up losing respect for himself as well as for others .
when he has no respect for anyone , he can no longer love and , in order to divert himself , having no love in him , he yields to his impulses , indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure , and behaves in the end like an animal , in satisfying his vices . and it all comes from lying—lying to others and to yourself .
a man who lies to himself , for instance , can take offense whenever he wishes , for there are times when it is rather pleasant to feel wronged—don ’ t you agree ?
so a man may know very well that no one has offended him , and may invent an offense , lie just for the beauty of it , or exaggerate what someone said to create a situation , making a mountain out of a molehill . and although he is well aware of it himself , he nevertheless does feel offended because he enjoys doing so , derives great pleasure from it , and so he comes to feel real hostility toward the imaginary offender .
blessed man , allow me to kiss your hand ! karamazov exclaimed , leaping to his feet , snatching the elder ’ s wizened hand , and hurriedly planting a loud kiss on it .
i ’ ve never heard it put so well before .
i have , indeed , been taking offense all my life because i enjoyed it and felt it was beautiful . it is not only pleasurable , it is also esthetically satisfying to feel offended .
yes , that is something you left out , great elder—the beauty of it .
i must make a note of it !
it is a fact that i have lied all my life , every day and every hour .
in truth , i am a living lie , the father of lies .
no , wait a minute , not the father of lies—i always get my quotations mixed up—well , let ’ s say the son , and that ’ s good enough .
diderot can do no harm , but sometimes a word can cause a lot of trouble .
ah , i almost forgot , great elder—for two years i ’ ve been determined to come here to consult you about something special . but first , perhaps you ’ d better warn mr. miusov not to interrupt me .
here ’ s what i wanted to ask you : is it true , holy father , as it says somewhere in the lives of the saints , that one holy miracle worker who suffered martyrdom for his faith stood up , after they had beheaded him , picked up his head , kissed it affectionately , and walked for a long time , carrying it in his hands and kissing it affectionately .
is that story true ?
no , it isn ’ t true , the elder said .
there ’ s nothing of the sort in the lives of the saints , said the father librarian . about which saint is it supposed to be written ?
i don ’ t know myself .
haven ’ t the slightest idea .
i was just told the story , misled . and shall i tell you who told me ?
all right—it was mr. miusov here , who just now was so furious about diderot .
it was he who told it to me .
when i was in paris , a frenchman told me it was from the lives of the saints and that they read it in russia in the mass .
he was a very learned man who was making a statistical study of russia .
he had spent a long time in this country . as for me , i ’ ve never read the lives of the saints , nor do i intend to .
so you ate your dinner and , as a result , i lost my faith that day , karamazov said , still taunting him .
much i care about your faith !
miusov was ready to shout at him but then , containing himself , he said scornfully : you defile everything you touch .
the elder rose abruptly from his sofa :
i hope you will excuse me , gentlemen , if i leave you—just for a few minutes , he said , addressing everyone present . some people who were here even before you arrived are waiting for me .
and you , he said , looking cheerfully at karamazov , see if you can manage without lying .
as he started out of the cell , alyosha and the novice hurried over to help him down the steps .
alyosha , who had been standing holding his breath , was very glad to be out of there , but he was also relieved that the elder didn ’ t seem at all offended and was cheerful as usual . the elder was about to leave the cell to bless those who were waiting for him , but karamazov stopped him in the doorway :
allow me to kiss your hand once more ! i see i can talk to you , i can get along with you .
perhaps you think i always lie like this and play the clown ?
well , i want you to know that i was deliberately testing you—i wanted to find out if it was possible to get along with you , whether there was room for my humility next to your pride .
so let me give you a certificate of good character : it is indeed possible to get along with you !
and now i ’ ll remain silent the rest of the time .
i ’ ll sit in my chair and i won ’ t say one word .
you will be the most important person here for the next ten minutes . a score of visitors , this time all peasant women , were waiting below by the gallery built outside the hermitage wall .
mrs. khokhlakov and her daughter had also come out into the gallery to wait for the elder , but in the part reserved for ladies .
mrs. khokhlakov , a wealthy woman , always tastefully dressed , was still young and very pretty ; she was rather pale , with very lively , almost black eyes .
she was no more than thirty-three and had been a widow for five years .
her fourteen-year-old daughter , whose legs were paralyzed , had been unable to walk for six months and had to be pushed around in a wheel-chair . she had a charming face , a little emaciated by sickness , but cheerful .
there was a mischievous sparkle in the big dark eyes behind her long lashes .
her mother had planned to take her abroad in the spring , but they had been detained throughout the summer by urgent business on the estate .
they had been in our town for a week already , having come on business rather than for devotions . nevertheless , they had already been to see zosima three days before .
and now , although they knew that the elder could receive hardly any visitors , they had come back , begging for one more chance to see the great healer .
the mother sat in a chair next to her daughter ’ s wheelchair and near her stood an old monk .
he also sought the elder ’ s blessing .
but when the elder appeared in the gallery , he didn ’ t stop but went straight down to the peasant women crowded around the three steps by the entrance .
the elder stood on the top step , put on his stole , and began blessing the women as they pressed close to him .
a crazy village girl was dragged toward him by both hands .
as soon as she saw the elder , she let out strange shrieks , was seized by violent hiccoughs , and shook as if in convulsions . zosima , placing the stole on her head , said a brief prayer , and the girl immediately quieted down .
i do not know what it is like now , but when i was a boy i often saw and heard such crazy , wailing women , in the villages or at monasteries .
when they were brought to mass , they shrieked , or barked like dogs , their cries filling the church .
as a child , i was greatly surprised by this .
but then the neighboring gentry and especially my teachers , who came from town , told me the women were malingering to avoid work , and that proper firmness would cure them once and for all . they told me a number of stories to prove the point .
later , however , specialists told me that it was not a sham at all , that it was a terrible female disease , particularly widespread in russia ( which shows what a hard life russian peasant women have ) , a sickness resulting from exhausting work following too soon upon a difficult , abnormal labor without medical help , and from an intensely unhappy life , full of brutality and ill-treatment , which , although common enough , is beyond the powers of endurance of some women . the strange and immediate healing effect of the host on these crazy women , which was dismissed as shamming or even as a trick of the clerics , can probably be explained quite simply by the fact that the women who lead such a woman forward , and above all the sick woman herself , are absolutely convinced that the evil spirit that has entered her will have to leave her body when she is led to the host and made to bow down before it .
and so the overwrought and mentally sick woman always experiences ( and can not help experiencing ) a violent shock throughout her entire body at the moment when she bends over the host , a shock produced by her complete faith in the forthcoming miraculous cure . and the miraculous cure is certain to occur , even if it lasts for only a moment .
that is what happened now , as soon as the elder covered the hysterical girl with his stole .
many of the women standing near him wept in ecstasy and exultation , some pressed forward to kiss the hem of his robe , others intoned prayers .
he blessed each one of them , speaking to some .
he already knew the sick girl—she came from a village only five miles from the monastery and had been brought to him on several previous occasions . here ’ s one from far away !
he said , indicating a woman who , though still young , was thin and haggard , and whose face seemed more blackened than suntanned .
she was kneeling , her eyes fixed on zosima .
there was something frenzied in her look .
from far away , holy father , from far away , she answered in a sing-song , her head swaying rhythmically from side to side , her face in her hands .
there is among peasants a dumb and long-suffering grief that is bottled up inside them and stifled .
but there is also a grief that bursts out , first in sobs , then in wailing—fits of wailing .
but it is no easier to bear than the silent grief .
the wailing only assuages by further lacerating and exasperating the heart . such grief does not seek consolation but feeds on an awareness of its hopelessness .
the wailing simply satisfies the constant need to irritate the wound .
we live in town now , father .
i came to see you , father , because we ’ d heard so much about you , so much .
i buried my baby son and then i set out—to pray for him . i went to three monasteries and they told me , go there too , nastya , go and pray there too , meaning this monastery , that is .
i arrived yesterday and i went to church , and today i ’ ve come to see you .
and why , exactly , are you weeping ?
i ’ m sad about my little boy , father . he would have been three in two months .
i miss my little son , my sweet baby , my last . we had four , nikita and i , but we can ’ t seem to keep them , our little ones , they just won ’ t stay , dear father , they just won ’ t .
when i buried the three older ones , i didn ’ t grieve too much for them , but this last one—i can ’ t get him out of my head .
it ’ s just like he ’ s standing here , right in front of my eyes , and never leaves me .
just looking at his little shirt or his tiny shoes starts me wailing . i put out his things that are left , all of them , and i look at them and wail .
so i say to my husband : let me go , nikita , let me go on a pilgrimage to pray , to god .
he is a coachman , my nikita , and we aren ’ t poor , father , we own the carriage and the horses ourselves .
but what ’ s the good of it all now ?
and i ’ m sure my nikita has taken to drink without me . i know he has , because even before he ’ d indulge whenever i turned my back .
but i can ’ t even think about him now .
i ’ ve been away from home more than two months .
i ’ ve forgotten everything .
no , i ’ m through with him , through with everybody .
i don ’ t want to set eyes on our house anymore or on our things , i don ’ t want to see any of it again . let me tell you something , mother , the elder said .
once , in ancient times , in a church , a great saint saw a woman just like you , weeping for her baby , her only one , whom god had also taken .
don ’ t you know , the saint said to the woman , how bold these little ones are before the throne of the lord ?
no one in the kingdom of heaven is bolder than they are . you gave us the gift of life , they say to the lord , but as soon as we beheld it you took it back from us .
and they ask and demand so boldly that the lord at once gives them the rank of angel . and so , the saint told the woman , you must rejoice instead of weeping , mother , because your little one is now with the lord among the angels .
that ’ s what the saint told the weeping woman , long , long ago .
and he was a great saint and can not have told her an untruth .
so you too must know that your child stands before the throne of the lord , rejoicing and happy , and prays to god for you .
and so you , too , weep but rejoice .
the woman listened to him , her eyes cast down , one cheek resting on her hand .
that ’ s just what my nikita tried to tell me—word for word what you have said , father : why are you crying , you fool ?
our little boy must be with the lord now , singing with the angels .
but as he says it , i see he ’ s crying himself .
i know that , nikita , i say to him . where else would he be , if not with the lord ?
but then he ’ s not here with us anymore .
i ’ d just stay quiet in my corner . if only i could see him and hear him playing , just for a minute , outside in the yard—and then come into the house as he used to and call out in his little voice : ma !
here ’ s his little belt , but he isn ’ t here , and i ’ ll never see him or hear him again .
she pulled out of her bosom a small embroidered belt , looked at it , and at once began shaking with sobs , the tears flowing from her eyes , which she covered with her fingers .
now , the elder said , you are like rachel in the bible , weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they were no more .
such is the lot of mothers on earth .
so do not be comforted—there is no need .
weep , but every time you do , remember that your little son is one of god ’ s angels , that he is looking down on you from where he is now , that he sees you and rejoices in your tears and shows them to god .
you will shed a mother ’ s tears for a long time to come , but in the end your weeping will turn into quiet joy , and your bitter tears will become tears of quiet tenderness which will cleanse your heart of sin .
and i shall pray for the peace of your boy ’ s soul .
what was his name ?
was he named for alexei the man of god ?
for the man of god , father , for alexei the man of god .
a great saint , he was !
i will certainly remember your son in my prayers . i will remember your sorrow too and i will also pray for your husband , that the lord may grant him health and happiness .
and now , go back to your husband and look after him . if your little boy sees from up there that you have abandoned his father , he will weep over both of you .
for he is alive , very much alive , since the soul lives forever .
but how can he come home to you when you say that you hate your home now ?
to whom will he come if he can not find his father and mother together ?
now he comes to you in your dreams and torments you , but if you go back he will send you sweet dreams .
go back to your husband , mother , go back to him this very day .
i ’ ll go , father , i ’ ll do as you say .
you ’ ve seen into my heart !
ah , nikita , my nikita , you ’ re waiting for me , my good husband !
the woman started in a wailing cadence , but the elder had turned away from her to a very old woman . this one was not dressed like a pilgrim but wore ordinary town clothes .
it was obvious from her expression that she had come on business , that she had something to tell him .
she said she was the widow of an army sergeant . she had not had to travel a long way , since she was from our town .
her son vasya , who was in the civil service , had been transferred to irkutsk in siberia .
she had received two letters from him at first , but now there had been no word from him for over a year .
she had tried to make inquiries about him , but she really didn ’ t even know where to inquire .
the other day , mrs. bedryagin—she ’ s the wife of a rich merchant—she says to me , why don ’ t you go to church , prokhorovna , and put your son ’ s name down for a requiem mass , just like he was dead .
that will make his soul feel uneasy , she says , and he ’ ll write you a letter .
it ’ s a sure thing , mrs. bedryagin tells me , it has worked time and again .
would it be the right thing to do , father ?
don ’ t even think of it !
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking .
how can anyone ask for a requiem mass for someone who is still alive , and you , his mother of all people !
that would be a mortal sin , akin to sorcery , and it is forgiven you only because of your ignorance .
instead , you ’ d better pray to the mother of god to intercede for your son , that the lord may grant him health , and for you , that he may forgive you for the error of your ways .
and let me tell you this , prokhorovna : your son will come back to you soon or at least he will certainly send you a letter .
you can count on it . go now and stop worrying—your son is alive , i promise you .
may god reward you , o beloved benefactor , who prays for us all , that all our sins may be forgiven .
but the elder ’ s attention had already been caught by two burning eyes in the haggard , consumptive face of a young peasant woman .
she looked at him in silence , her eyes imploring him , but did not dare to come closer .
what is it you wish , my dear ?
take a load off my soul , dear father , she said softly and slowly as she went down on her knees and bowed to the ground .
i have sinned , my father , and i ’ m afraid of my sin .
the elder sat down on the bottom step , and the woman moved closer to him without rising from her knees .
i ’ ve been a widow for two years , she said in a half whisper , shuddering as she spoke .
it was hard being married to him , he was old and beat me terribly .
so when he lay sick , i looked at him and i said to myself : if he gets better , he ’ ll get up and then what ?
and that is when the thought came to me .
wait , the elder said and brought his ear close to her lips .
the woman went on , whispering so quietly that it was almost impossible to make out the words .
over two years ago ?
at first i didn ’ t think about it much , but now i ’ ve got sick , and it bothers me .
have you come from far away ?
three hundred miles .
have you already confessed this to a priest ?
twice i ’ ve confessed it .
have you been admitted to communion ?
i ’ m afraid to die .
don ’ t be afraid of anything , ever .
as long as your repentance does not weaken , god will forgive everything .
there is not—there can not be—a sin on earth that god will not forgive the truly repentant .
why , a man can not commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of god .
how could there be a sin that would surpass the love of god ?
think only of repentance , all the time , and drive away all fear .
have faith that god loves you more than you can ever imagine . he loves you , sinful as you are and , indeed , because of your sin .
it was said long ago that there is more joy in heaven over one repentant sinner than over ten righteous men .
go now , and fear nothing .
and forgive your departed husband all the harm he did you . become truly reconciled with him .
for if you repent , you love , and if you love , you are with god .
love redeems and saves everything . if i , a sinner like yourself , am moved and feel compassion for you , how infinitely much more will god !
love is such an infinite treasure it can buy the whole world and can redeem not only your sins , but the sins of all people .
so go and fear no more .
he made the sign of the cross over her three times , took the holy icon from his own neck , and put it around hers .
she bowed down to the ground in silence .
he got up from the step where he had been sitting , looking smilingly at a big , strong peasant woman with a baby in her arms . i ’ m from vyshegorie , beloved father .
so you walked five weary miles , carrying the child , he said .
what ’ s your trouble ?
i just wanted to see you , father .
i ’ ve been here before .
your memory can ’ t be too good if you ’ ve forgotten me already .
people in my village were saying you weren ’ t feeling good , so i think : if that ’ s so , i ’ d better go and see for myself .
but now i ’ m here , you don ’ t look too sick to me .
you ’ ll be around for another twenty years yet , god bless you !
besides , there are enough people to pray for you to keep you from being sick .
thank you for everything , my dear .
while i ’ m here , i must ask you a small favor too : i have sixty kopeks here , take it and give it to someone poorer than me . on my way here , i says to myself : guess i ’ d better give him this money .
thank you , my dear , thank you , good woman .
i love you .
is it a girl you have ? yes , dear father .
may the lord bless you , both you and baby lizaveta .
you have gladdened my heart , my dear .
and now , good-by , my dear , good-by , beloved people .
he blessed all the women and bowed low to them . watching the elder talking to these humble women and blessing them , mrs. khokhlakov kept wiping away her tears with a little handkerchief .
she was a sentimental lady with many genuinely kind impulses .
when the elder finally approached her , she looked at him ecstatically .
i ’ ve experienced so much , watching this inspiring scene , that . she was too moved to finish .
oh , i understand why the simple people love you .
i myself love ordinary people , i want to love them .
how does your daughter feel ?
did you want to talk to me again ?
i requested it most insistently . i was prepared to go down on my knees , to stay kneeling before your windows for three whole days if i had to , until you received me .
we have come to you , great healer , to express our fervent gratitude .
why , you have cured my lise , cured her completely .
just by saying a prayer over her last thursday and laying your hands on her .
we are anxious to kiss those hands , to pour out our feelings and our veneration .
what do you mean—i healed her ?
she ’ s still in her wheelchair , isn ’ t she ? but she ’ s had no fever for the past two nights , no fever since thursday , none at all , the lady rattled on .
besides , her legs have grown stronger .
she had slept soundly all night , and her cheeks were rosy and her eyes bright .
she used to cry all the time , but now she is cheerful and keeps laughing .
today she actually demanded to be allowed to get up , to stand on her feet , and she did stand up for a whole minute without any help .
she wants to make a wager with me that in a fortnight she ’ ll be dancing the quadrille .
i called in the local doctor , herzenstube , to see her , and he just spread his arms wide in amazement : i ’ m stunned !
and you expected us not to disturb you , as though we could keep ourselves from flying over here to thank you . well , lise , come , thank the elder !
lise ’ s pretty , laughing face suddenly turned grave .
she raised herself as far as she could in her wheel-chair and , looking at the elder , clasped her hands as if in prayer . but the next second she lost control of herself and burst out laughing .
she cried , pointing at alyosha , childishly annoyed at herself for not being able to restrain her laughter .
anyone looking at alyosha , who was standing one step behind the elder , would have noticed that his cheeks turned bright red ; his eyes flashed and he lowered them .
mrs. khokhlakov turned toward alyosha and , giving him her elegantly gloved hand , said : she has a message for you , alexei .
the elder turned suddenly to look attentively at alyosha , who then walked over to lise and , smiling awkwardly , gave her his hand .
lise put on a serious face .
katerina ivanovna asked me to give you this , she said , handing him a small envelope .
she asks particularly that you come and see her , and she wants you to come soon , without fail , and not to let her down .
alyosha muttered , extremely surprised .
his face took on a very worried look .
katerina has made up her mind on a certain subject , but she absolutely must see you first .
that i don ’ t know , but she insisted it was very urgent and that you should go as soon as possible . and you must go .
i would even say it is your duty as a christian to go . but i ’ ve only seen her once , alyosha said , still bewildered .
she is such a noble , such an exceptional person !
all right , i ’ ll go and see her , alyosha decided , holding in his hand the brief note , which contained no explanation , only an urgent request that he come . it would be so nice , so good of you ! lise cried out , at once becoming very animated .
he won ’ t go , i told mother . he ’ s too busy saving his soul .
but you ’ re really wonderful !
i always thought you were wonderful and i ’ m very happy to tell you so .
her mother said reproachfully , but she could not suppress a smile and , turning to alyosha , went on : you seem to have forgotten us completely , alexei . you refuse to come and visit us , although lise has told me twice that you ’ re the only person with whom she feels at ease .
alyosha raised his downcast eyes , again turned red , and again grinned rather incongruously .
the elder , however , was no longer watching him but was talking to the visiting monk who had been waiting near lise ’ s chair .
he was apparently a very lowly monk , of humble origin , a stubborn man with a narrow , rigid set of beliefs , but with genuine faith .
he said he had come from the monastery of st. sylvester in obdorsk , somewhere in the far north , a poor little monastery that had only ten monks .
the elder blessed him and invited him to come and visit him in his cell whenever he wished .
suddenly the monk pointed at lise and asked in a solemn and admonishing tone : how do you presume to accomplish such feats ?
of course , it ’ s still too early to tell—partial relief is by no means a complete recovery , and it could be due to other causes .
everything comes from god .
come and see me , father , the elder added , looking at the monk , although there are moments when i ’ m in no state to see people .
god will not take you from us—you will be with us for a long time yet , mrs. khokhlakov exclaimed . besides , how can you be sick ?
you look gay , cheerful , and in good health to me ! as a matter of fact , i do feel incomparably better today , but i know very well that it can not last .
i ’ ve come to understand my illness unerringly now .
and if you think i look cheerful , nothing you could say could give me more pleasure .
for human beings were created to be happy , and those who are perfectly happy are entitled to say to themselves : i have carried out god ’ s will on this earth .
the righteous , the saints , the holy martyrs—they were all happy people .
oh , you speak so well .
your words are so bold and so noble !
when you say something , you go right to the essence of things . and yet you talk of happiness .
where is that happiness ?
and since you have been so kind as to see us once more , i hope you will allow me to tell you something i didn ’ t finish telling you last time . i didn ’ t dare tell you all that has been tormenting me for such a long , long time !
i suffer , forgive me , i suffer .
she clasped her hands prayerfully , overwhelmed by emotion .
i suffer from my lack of faith .
from not believing in god ?
i wouldn ’ t even dare think of that . but life after death—it is such a puzzle and no one , no one at all , has the answer !
please listen to me , you who can heal , you who know the human soul so well ; of course i don ’ t dare to presume that you will believe everything i say , but i give you my solemn word that i am not talking lightly now , and that the thought of life beyond the grave worries , terrifies , and torments me .
oh , my god , what will you think of me now !
and she threw up her hands in despair .
don ’ t worry about my opinion of you , the elder said .
i entirely believe in the sincerity of your anguish .
oh , thank you , thank you !
you see , i close my eyes and i reason like this : people do have faith , but where does it come from ?
i ’ ve heard it said that it all came originally from fear of menacing natural phenomena , and that there ’ s nothing else to it . so i say to myself : what if , after i ’ ve been a believer all my life , when i die it suddenly turns out that after life there ’ s nothing at all , nothing but wild grass growing on my grave , as some writer put it .
and how can i regain my faith ?
i must say , i only really believed when i was a little girl .
this is what i have come here for , to throw myself at your feet and ask you .
why , if i miss this opportunity , i will never find the answer in all my life .
so how can i prove it to myself , how can i become convinced ?
oh , i am so unhappy !
when i look around me , i realize that people don ’ t care , hardly anyone does , and i ’ m the only one who can not bear it .
i am sure it is dreadful , but nothing can be proved , although one can become convinced .
by acts of love .
try to love your neighbors , love them actively and unceasingly .
and as you learn to love them more and more , you will be more and more convinced of the existence of god and of the immortality of your soul .
and if you achieve complete self-abnegation in your love for your fellow man , you will certainly gain faith , and there will be no room in your soul for any doubt whatsoever .
this has been tested .
this is the true way .
you see , i love mankind so much that , believe it or not , there are moments when i would like to give up everything , abandon lise , and become a hospital nurse .
i close my eyes and let my imagination wander , and during those minutes i feel an irresistible strength within me .
no wounds , no infected sores , however terrible , could frighten me away then .
i would be ready to kiss their sores .
it is good that you should think of these things rather than others .
but it would be very nice if you actually performed some good deed . yes , but how long do you think i could live such a life ?
mrs. khokhlakov said heatedly , an almost hysterical note creeping into her voice .
that ’ s the crucial point ! yes , that ’ s the question that torments me most .
i close my eyes and i ask myself : how long do you think you could endure that life ?
what if a patient , whose sores you were cleaning , instead of being grateful to you , tormented you with his whims and had no appreciation whatsoever for your services to mankind , talked rudely to you , or even complained about you to your superiors , as people who are in pain so often do ?
what would happen then ?
would you go on loving him or not ?
and i must tell you that , to my own dismay , i have come to this conclusion : if anything could dampen my active love ’ for mankind , it is ingratitude .
i mean i want to be praised and paid for love with love .
she seemed to be in a paroxysm of sincere self-deprecation and , as she finished , there was a challenge to the elder in her eyes .
that ’ s exactly what a doctor told me quite some time ago , the elder remarked . he was not a young man and he was certainly intelligent .
he was just as sincere as you are , although he spoke in an amused tone , with a sort of bitter humor .
i love mankind , he said , but i find to my amazement that the more i love mankind as a whole , the less i love individual people . in my thoughts , the doctor told me , i often visualize ecstatically the sacrifices i could make for mankind and , indeed , i might even accept martyrdom for my fellow men if circumstances suddenly demanded it of me . in actual fact , however , i can not bear to spend two days in the same room with another person .
whenever someone is too close to me , i feel my personal dignity and freedom are being infringed upon .
within twenty-four hours i can come to hate the best of men , perhaps because he eats too slowly or because he has a cold and keeps blowing his nose . i become a man ’ s enemy , he said , as soon as he touches me . but to make up for it , the more i hate individual people , the more ardent is my general love for mankind .
what ’ s to be done in such a case ?
is it completely hopeless ?
no , because the very fact that it worries you is enough in itself . do the best you can and it will stand you in good stead .
as it is , you have done a great deal , for you have come to know yourself deeply and sincerely .
however , if you have spoken to me so frankly only to make me praise you for your sincerity , then , of course , you will fail to accomplish true acts of love ; all your good intentions will remain mere daydreams , and your whole life will slip by like a shadow . in that case , you will certainly forget all about the future life as well , and in the end you will somehow or other stop worrying altogether .
i feel completely crushed !
this very second i realize that , just as you say , i was expecting you to praise me for my sincerity when i told you that i would not be able to bear ingratitude . you have brought out what was within me .
you saw it and you have shown it to me !
do you really mean what you say now ? if so , after what you have admitted , i am sure that you are sincere and that you have a good heart .
even if it is not given to you to achieve happiness , you must always remember that you are on the right path and you must try not to stray from it . above all , avoid lying , especially lying to yourself .
keep watching out for your lies , watch for them every hour , every minute .
also avoid disgust , both for others and for yourself : whatever strikes you as disgusting within yourself is cleansed by the mere fact that you notice it .
avoid fear too , although fear is really only a consequence of lies .
never be afraid of your petty selfishness when you try to achieve love , and don ’ t be too alarmed if you act badly on occasion .
i ’ m sorry i can not tell you anything more reassuring . a true act of love , unlike imaginary love , is hard and forbidding .
imaginary love yearns for an immediate heroic act that is achieved quickly and seen by everyone . people may actually reach a point where they are willing to sacrifice their lives , as long as the ordeal doesn ’ t last too long , is quickly over—just like on the stage , with the public watching and admiring .
a true act of love , on the other hand , requires hard work and patience , and , for some , it is a whole way of life . but i predict that at the very moment when you see despairingly that , despite all your efforts , you have not only failed to come closer to your goal but , indeed , seem even farther from it than ever—at that very moment , you will have achieved your goal and will recognize the miraculous power of our lord , who has always loved you and has secretly guided you all along .
and now , please forgive me—i can not stay with you any longer . some people are waiting for me .
won ’ t you bless her ?
she cried suddenly , as if emerging from a trance .
she doesn ’ t even deserve to be loved , the elder said jokingly .
why have you been laughing at alexei all this time ?
lise had been doing just this .
she had realized , ever since she had seen alyosha on the previous occasion , that he seemed embarrassed in her presence and avoided looking at her . she found this very funny and amused herself by trying to catch his eye .
feeling her intense gaze constantly following him , alyosha felt impelled by some irresistible force and was unable to prevent himself from quickly glancing at her from time to time . and whenever he did so , their eyes met and she smiled triumphantly , right in his face , and alyosha became even more embarrassed and angry with himself .
so finally he turned away from her completely and hid behind the elder ’ s back .
after a few minutes , again acting on the same uncontrollable impulse , alyosha turned to see whether she was still looking at him , and saw lise , leaning over so far that she was almost hanging out of her chair , looking at him from the side and waiting intently for him to glance at her . this time , when she caught his eye , she laughed aloud , so that the elder turned to her and said :
you are a bad girl ! why are you trying to embarrass him ?
lise unexpectedly turned very red . her eyes flashed , her face became grave , and she spoke heatedly and nervously , as though complaining indignantly about alyosha :
and why has he forgotten everything ?
when i was little , he used to carry me around and we used to play together .
you know he taught me to read ?
and when he was leaving two years ago , he told me he ’ d never forget me and that we ’ d always be friends , always , always , he said .
and now he seems to be afraid of me , as though i were going to eat him or something .
why won ’ t he come over and talk to me ? why doesn ’ t he want to come to our house ?
is it you who won ’ t allow him to come and visit us ? but we know that he goes where he pleases .
he should have thought of it himself if he really hadn ’ t forgotten me . but i see that he ’ s too busy saving his soul now !
but why do you make him wear that cassock ? it ’ s too long , and he ’ ll fall down if he tries to run .
and suddenly , unable to restrain herself , she covered her face with both hands and burst into nervous , violent , but muted laughter .
the elder listened to her with a smile and then blessed her with great gentleness .
as she was about to kiss his hand , she suddenly pressed it against her eyes and began to cry .
i ’ m a fool and i ’ m really not worth bothering about . and i think alyosha is right , quite right , not to come and see a ridiculous person like me .
i ’ ll see to it that he comes to see you , the elder said .
the elder had been away from his cell for about twenty-five minutes .
it was after twelve-thirty and dmitry karamazov , who was the main reason for the gathering , had still not arrived .
they seemed almost to have forgotten about him , however , and when the elder returned to his cell his guests were engaged in a very animated conversation .
the principals were ivan karamazov and the two monks .
miusov kept trying—apparently very anxiously—to join in the argument , but again he had no luck . he was obviously not taken seriously , the others hardly even bothering to answer him , and this seemed to increase his irritability even further . the trouble was that even before this he and ivan had needled each other on various learned subjects and he could not bear ivan ’ s condescendingly casual air toward him .
up till now i ’ ve always been abreast of the latest developments in european thinking , yet this new russian generation is just determined to ignore us , he thought .
as to fyodor karamazov , who had promised to remain silent , he did indeed stay quiet for a while . he sat in his chair and watched his neighbor miusov with a sarcastic little smile , obviously delighting in his frustration .
for a long time he had been planning to get even with miusov for certain things and now he did not want to miss the opportunity to do so .
finally , unable to contain himself any longer , he bent toward his neighbor ’ s ear and said in an undertone , taunting him :
how is it that you didn ’ t leave right after the kissing ceremony , but consented to stay in such disreputable company ? shall i tell you why ? it was because you felt humbled and insulted and decided to stay to get your own back and show them all how brilliant you are .
there you go again ! well , you ’ re wrong , i ’ ll leave now . you ’ ll leave after all the others !
it was at this point that the elder came back into the room . the conversation came to a halt for a moment , but as the elder resumed his seat , he looked around at the others , apparently inviting them to continue their discussion .
alyosha , who had come to know every expression on the elder ’ s face , saw clearly that he was exhausted and that it cost him a great effort to remain there .
in the latest phase of his sickness , zosima often suffered fainting fits which were caused by physical weakness .
now he was almost as pale as just before such a fit , and his lips had turned white .
alyosha watched him intently .
we ’ ve been talking about the very interesting article this gentleman wrote , the monastery librarian said , gesturing toward ivan .
it is full of original ideas , but i think it cuts both ways .
it is about the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts and was written in answer to a whole book by a prominent churchman on that subject .
unfortunately i haven ’ t read your article , but i have heard about it , the elder said , looking intently at ivan .
he has a very curious approach to the problem , the monastery librarian explained .
he seems to reject completely the separation of church and state when dealing with the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts .
that is curious . but in what sense ?
the elder asked ivan .
when ivan answered him , he did not do so condescendingly , as alyosha had feared he would , but spoke quietly , self-effacingly , with great courtesy and apparently complete frankness .
i start from the premise that , although they are doomed to failure , attempts will always be made to combine the essential elements of church and state , considered as separate entities , but these attempts can never succeed in producing a workable solution because they are based on a complete fallacy .
thus , the conciliation of claims between church and state on such matters as the administration of justice is , in my opinion , quite impossible by its very nature . the churchman against whom i argue contends that the church has a clearly defined place within the state .
i answer that , on the contrary , instead of occupying some little corner within the state , the church should contain the state , and if it can not do so immediately , it ought to make that a prime goal in the development of a christian society . very true , father paisii , a learned and taciturn monk , assented in a tense , decisive tone .
miusov said , impatiently recrossing his legs .
eh , we don ’ t even have any mountains here , the monastery librarian remarked and turned back to zosima .
the author of this article answers , among other things , the following fundamental contentions of his opponent , who is , be it remembered , an ecclesiastic : first , that no social organization should claim or be allowed to usurp the civilian and political rights of its members ; second , that the criminal and civil courts can not be controlled by the church because that would be incompatible with the nature of an institution vested with divine authority , or of an association of men formed for religious purposes ; and third , that the church is a kingdom not of this world .
that is playing on words in a way quite unworthy of an ecclesiastic !
paisii interrupted again indignantly . i have read the book against which you argue in your article , he said , turning to ivan , and i was quite taken aback by the words the church is a kingdom not of this world ’ coming from an ecclesiastic .
if it is not of this world , how can it be on earth at all ? the words not of this world ’ are used in a completely different context in the holy gospels , and no one should trifle with them .
the very purpose of the coming of our lord jesus christ to earth was to establish the church here .
obviously , the kingdom of heaven is not of this world , since it is in heaven , but the only way to enter it is through the church that has been set up on this earth .
and , therefore , any interpretation or sophisticated play on words is impermissible and unworthy of a churchman .
indeed , the church is a kingdom , ordained to reign , and ultimately it will become a kingdom of all the earth , as was preordained by our lord .
he suddenly fell silent , making an obvious effort to restrain himself . ivan , who had listened to him with respectful attention , spoke again with perfect composure .
my whole article is based on the idea that , during its first three centuries , christianity existed on earth as a church .
but when the pagan roman empire decided to become christian , it was inevitable that , in turning christian , it simply incorporated the church while , in fact , remaining essentially pagan .
indeed , it was bound to be that way .
but in rome too much was left of her pagan wisdom and civilization—among other things , the very goals and foundations of the state .
among these goals is the integration of the whole world—including , therefore , the pagan state—into the church . thus , in view of these long-range goals , it is not up to the church to seek a proper place for itself within the state , like any other public agency or association of men for religious purposes , as the author of the book against which i argue puts its .
since ultimately every secular state is to be integrated into the church and become nothing but the church , it is the state that must discard all goals that are incompatible with those of the church .
and this would involve no humiliation , no slur on the honor and glory of a great state , or loss of prestige to its rulers . it would simply transfer the concept of the state from the wrong premises to the correct ones , to the only true way of achieving the eternal goals .
for this reason , the author of the foundations of the ecclesiastical courts would have been right if , in searching for and defining those foundations , he had considered them as a temporary compromise for our sinful and transitory era , but nothing more than that . but when the author dares to declare that the foundations he mentions—some of which were noted by father joseph a few moments ago—are natural , immutable , and eternal , he thereby goes directly against the church and its sacred mission , preordained from time immemorial .
and that is the gist of my article .
which means , to sum up briefly , said father paisii , stressing every word , that , according to certain theories of which the point has become only too clear in our nineteenth century , the church is to evolve into a state , the way a lower order of life evolves into a higher one , and eventually is to disappear altogether as a religious institution , being superseded by science , technical progress , and secularism .
and if the church refuses to accept that fate and resists , it is to be rewarded for its pains by being allotted a corner in the preserve of the state , and even that would be under the supervision of the state . this is the situation today in every european country .
but , according to the russian idea and hope , it is not the church that is to be transformed into the state , as an inferior form into a superior one ; it is rather the state that must eventually become part of the church .
so it shall be and so be it !
well , i must say , i feel somewhat reassured ! miusov snorted , again recrossing his legs .
as far as i can make out , you seem to be talking about the realization of some ideal in the distant future , perhaps at the second coming of christ . in that case , i have no objection .
it is a beautiful , utopian dream of a world without wars , diplomats , banks , and so on .
in a way , it resembles socialism .
for a moment i thought you were talking seriously about the church doing such things as prosecuting criminals and sentencing people to floggings , detention , and even , i suppose , death .
even if all justice today were administered by ecclesiastical courts , the church would not sentence anyone either to forced labor or to death .
the whole concept of crime , and how to deal with it , would be different .
of course , it would not change suddenly , all at once , but would evolve gradually .
miusov asked , looking closely at ivan . if everything were integrated into the church , the church would excommunicate the criminal and the subversive , instead of chopping off their heads , ivan went on .
just think—where could the excommunicate go ?
why , he would be cut off not only from men but also from christ , since his crime would be a crime not only against his fellow men but also against christ ’ s church .
strictly speaking , of course , this is true now .
i steal , one may say , for instance , but i wouldn ’ t do anything against the church , because i am not an enemy of christ . but while criminals often justify themselves in this way today , the moment the church superseded the state , they could no longer appease their consciences unless they said : everyone else is wrong ; they have all lost god , and their church is a false church .
now let us look at the church ’ s approach to crime : isn ’ t it bound to differ from the state ’ s approach today , which is an almost pagan approach—the mechanical amputation of the diseased limb for the protection of society ? the church would aim at the total , true regeneration of man , his spiritual rebirth , and the salvation of his .
what are you saying ? i ’ ve lost you again , miusov interrupted him .
it ’ s some sort of dream again , something formless . i can ’ t even follow you .
i suspect you ’ re just having fun at other people ’ s expense , ivan .
but this is just as true today , the elder suddenly spoke out , and they all immediately turned to him .
i ’ m not talking of mechanical ’ punishment , such as was described a moment ago , which in most cases only hardens a criminal , but of real punishment , the only effective one , that people fear and that can bring peace—the awareness of one ’ s own conscience .
but what do you mean by that ?
miusov asked , filled with lively curiosity .
what i mean , the elder went on , is that all this business of sentencing people to hard labor , with or without flogging , does not reform criminals and , more to the point , does not deter them from committing crimes . so the number of crimes not only does not diminish—it keeps increasing .
it turns out , consequently , that society is not really protected by this method because , even if a dangerous member is cut off and put far away out of sight , immediately another criminal will appear in his place , and sometimes even two .
if anything protects society in our time , if anything can reform the criminal and make a new man out of him , it is only the law of christ , which manifests itself in the awareness of a man ’ s own conscience .
it is only after a man has recognized his guilt as a son of christ ’ s society , that is , of the church , that he will become conscious of his guilt toward society , that is , toward the church .
consequently , today ’ s criminal can recognize his guilt only toward the church , and not toward the state .
so if the administration of justice were in the hands of society as represented by the church , it would know whom it should absolve from excommunication and receive again as its son . but as things stand today , the church has no legal authority , only the power of moral condemnation .
she does not excommunicate him , she only offers him maternal advice . indeed , she tries to abide by the pledge made by christ ’ s church to the criminal : to admit him to church services and to the holy sacrament , to give him alms and treat him as a captive rather than as a convict .
and what would become of the criminal , o lord , if the christian community , that is , the church , rejected him and cut him off as the law of the state does ?
what would happen if every time a man was punished by the state , the church followed suit by excommunicating him ?
the answer is that there could be no deeper despair , at least for a russian criminal , because russian criminals are still believers .
and who knows , perhaps the result would be truly tragic—in his despair the criminal might lose his faith .
and so the church , acting like a tender and loving mother , will take no part in meting out punishment because , even without the church , a man condemned by the state courts is sufficiently punished , and there should be someone , after all , to take pity on him .
but the main reason for the church ’ s keeping aloof is that the law of the church is the only true law and it can not , therefore , make the slightest concession to any other law or even accept a temporary compromise .
but a non-russian criminal , i have been told , rarely repents , since many modern theories confirm him in his belief that a crime is not really a crime but only a gesture of protest against an unjust and oppressive force .
society cuts him off , as a matter of course , because it is stronger than he , and accompanies its ostracism of him with hatred ( so , at least , europeans themselves describe it ) ; then it shows no interest whatever in the further fate of that human being and soon forgets all about him .
and as all this takes place , there is no one to take pity on the condemned man , because in many countries there is no church any longer ; all they have left is the clergy and magnificent buildings that used to be churches . for their churches have long been evolving from the lower form of church into the higher form of state , in which they will be completely dissolved and vanish .
this is what happens at least in lutheran countries , i believe .
as to rome , they proclaimed a state instead of a church a full thousand years ago .
hence , a criminal there can not consider himself a member of the church . he is excommunicated and sinks into despair .
and if he does return to society , he is so full of hatred that it is he , as it were , who excommunicates society from himself .
how it will end , i leave to your imagination .
at various times it has seemed as though russia would follow the same course . but the difference lies in the very fact that , in addition to the civil courts of justice , we also have a church that never loses contact with the criminal and treats him like a dear and still beloved son ; and also the church in russia does play a role in upholding the law , even if only in people ’ s minds ; for , although the church does not actually sit in judgment over criminals , they fear her condemnation and thus acknowledge her authority . it is also true , as has been contended here , that if the church were given full control of the administration of justice , that is , if the whole community were integrated into the church , then not only would the ecclesiastical courts work for the regeneration of criminals as no courts of justice can today , but also the number of crimes might be tremendously reduced .
and there is no doubt that the church herself would , in many cases , look upon criminals and crime quite differently , and she would succeed in bringing back the outcasts , in preventing crimes from being committed , and in regenerating the fallen . it is true , though , the elder said with a faint smile , that christian society itself is not yet ready for this , as it still rests precariously on seven righteous men . but as long as these men exist , society will stand firm , waiting for total transformation from a pagan community into one universal sovereign church .
and even if this should not happen till the end of time , happen it will because it has been so ordained . so it shall be and so be it ! nor should we worry about the length of time it will take or the day when it will come to pass , because the secret of the time and the day lies in god ’ s wisdom , his vision of the future , and his love .
and what to a man may appear infinitely remote may in god ’ s design be very near , already within reach .
so it shall be and so be it !
so it shall be and so be it !
father paisii echoed with stern solemnity .
all this is very , very strange , miusov said .
what is this about the state being eliminated and the church raised to the status of a state !
this is no longer ultramontanism , this is arch-ultramontanism !
this is something that pope gregory vii himself could not have dreamed up !
you have completely misunderstood , sir , father paisii said sternly . it is not the church that is to be turned into the state .
that is rome and its dream .
it is the third temptation of the devil !
just the opposite is true—it is the state that will be transformed into the church . it will rise to the status of a church and become the universal church .
it is just the opposite of ultramontanism , of rome , and of your interpretation , and it is the great mission and destination of the orthodox church on earth .
the star will rise in the east !
miusov maintained a dignified silence . his entire person contrived to convey his tremendous respect for himself .
a condescending smile twisted his lips .
alyosha ’ s heart pounded as he watched them all .
for a second his glance rested on rakitin . rakitin was still standing by the door , motionless , listening , following intently , although he kept his eyes lowered .
from his flushed cheeks , alyosha could see that rakitin was no less excited than he himself , and he guessed what the cause of his excitement was .
suddenly miusov broke his silence , speaking with overbearing condescension . i wonder , he said , if you gentlemen would allow me to tell you a little story .
when i was in paris a few years ago—it was soon after the december coup d ’ état—i went to see an acquaintance of mine who at that time held a very important position in the government , and during my visit i met an extremely interesting gentleman .
now , since he was there as a subordinate , to make some sort of report to my acquaintance , whereas i was received as a personal friend—a fact which he realized very well—he answered my questions with a certain degree of frankness—or at least he was extremely courteous rather than frank , the way frenchmen can be courteous , especially to foreigners .
but i understood him perfectly .
the main topic of our conversation was the socialist revolutionaries who , incidentally , were at that time being persecuted .
i will spare you the brunt of the conversation and repeat only a curious remark that the gentleman made quite inadvertently : we aren ’ t really too worried about all these socialists , anarchists , atheists , revolutionaries , and the like . we keep our eye on them and we know what they ’ re likely to try next .
but there are among them some , though not many , peculiar types who believe in god—christians who are at the same time socialists .
they are the ones who worry us most . they are the most dangerous !
a christian socialist is much more dangerous than an atheistic socialist .
i was struck by these words at the time and now they come back to me .
you mean that you apply them to us and that you regard us as socialists ?
father paisii asked him point blank . but before miusov could answer , the door opened and dmitry karamazov made his very late appearance .
apparently they had all given up hope of seeing him , since his sudden arrival seemed to cause a certain surprise .
at twenty -eight , dmitry karamazov looked much older than he was . he was of medium height , powerfully muscled , and obviously endowed with great physical strength , but his thin , sallow , hollow-cheeked face left an impression of ill-health .
and there was something vague about the otherwise determined look in his rather large , dark , somewhat bulging eyes .
even when he grew excited and spoke irritatedly , his eyes seemed disconnected from his inner state and to express something quite unrelated to what he was saying .
hard to know what he ’ s thinking , was the general impression he produced on people who talked to him . at times , he would look at people with a dreamy , melancholy gaze and then suddenly surprise them by bursting into gay laughter , which probably reflected gay and playful thoughts that had been churning in his head all the while .
it must be said that anyone could think of many good reasons for dmitry ’ s drawn and haggard features ; everyone had heard of the irregular and dissipated life he had been leading , particularly of late , and they also knew how upset and irritated he was by his arguments with his father over money .
several stories on the subject were going around town .
it is true , though , that dmitry had by nature a temper that he found hard to control . an unbalanced and unpredictable spirit , as our justice of the peace , semyon kachalnikov , once aptly described him at a public gathering .
dmitry arrived impeccably dressed in the latest fashion , wearing a black coat buttoned all the way down and black gloves , and carrying a top-hat in his hand .
having recently retired from the army , he still wore an officer ’ s moustache .
his dark-brown hair was short and combed forward at the temples .
he walked with the long , firm stride of a military man .
he stopped for a second by the door as he came in , glanced quickly around , and then went straight over to the elder , guessing him to be the host .
he bowed deeply to him and asked for his blessing . the elder half rose from his seat and blessed him . dmitry kissed his hand with great reverence and then , sounding very agitated , almost angry , said :
please forgive me for being so late .
my father ’ s servant , smerdyakov , who was sent to inform me of this meeting , repeated twice with the utmost assurance , when i asked him about the time , that it was set for one p.m. .
please think nothing of it . don ’ t let it worry you , the elder interrupted him . even if you are a little late , no harm has been done at all .
i could not have expected less from a man of your kindness , dmitry said , interrupting him in his turn .
he bowed once more to the elder , and then , turning abruptly toward his father , unexpectedly bowed to him just as deeply and respectfully .
it was quite evident that he had planned that bow well in advance , sincerely feeling that it was his duty to register his good intentions and his respect for his father . although mr. karamazov was caught unawares by his son ’ s gesture , he managed to cope with the situation in his own style : he answered dmitry ’ s bow by leaping up from his chair and bowing back to him just as solemnly and respectfully .
his face took on a grave and solemn expression , and this somehow made him look positively evil . dmitry looked around the room , bowed once more , this time generally to all the other people there , and walked in his long , firm soldier ’ s stride toward the window where , near father paisii , stood the last unoccupied chair . he sat down , leaning forward , ready to listen to the conversation he had interrupted by his arrival .
all this had taken no more than a couple of minutes , and the conversation was resumed as a matter of course . miusov , however , did not find it necessary to answer father paisii ’ s pressing and almost angry question .
