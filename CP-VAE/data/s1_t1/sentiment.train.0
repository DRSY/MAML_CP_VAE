the archdeacon , seeing that all his violent efforts served only to weaken the one fragile support left to him , had decided not to move any more
i ’ ll take care not to
i understand , he answered
her hair was covered in gold dust , curled in front , and at the back hanging down in long braids with pearls at the end
with their big eyes , big bellies and both arms raised shoulder high , they looked as though they were alive under their fresh paint and sharing in the people ’ s delight
the moment the archdeacon noticed this unknown man his attention seemed to be divided between the dancer and him , and his expression grew darker and darker
but a hundredfold more would have been needed to take the town
it was as though he felt that she was something delicate , exquisite , and precious , made for other hands than his
this affection developed to an exceptional degree
he studied languages , latin , greek , hebrew , a threefold sanctuary at that time frequented by very few
an infernal priest who is pursuing me !
a peasant poaching noblemen ’ s game !
the text has been abrogated , said the advocate extraordinary to the king
she began singing to an old tune :
a fine beauty indeed !
then phoebus roared with laughter and wagged his head with a triumphant look
at least , he thought , i may find there a brand from the bonfire to warm me up , and find a crumb for supper from the three great coats of arms worked in royal sugar they are bound to have set up there on the buffet offered to the public by the town
and her voice lingered plaintively , as if calling to someone
as she said this , with her other arm stretched out of the window she showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe
brother , answered the student , striving to achieve a decent , piteous , and modest demeanour , turning his cap round in his hands with an air of innocence , i was coming to ask you … ’
it was the hour when the first early-morning windows in the great city open cheerfully upon the roofs
you came here to see the curiosities of paris
charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous frown of a poet searching for a rhyme
and they are going to take her away again !
so he would pour out his heart to them at length
once the mercenaries were destroyed , the nomads would give him no more trouble
in each a triple row of bronze chains , fixed to the navels of the pataeci gods , stretched in parallel from one end to another ; the crowd was crammed against the houses and , in the middle , walked the elders ’ servants , brandishing lashes
at that he slowly lowered his arm , and looked at the pavement in deepest despondency
it ’ s true that those little feet were so tiny , so pretty , so pink !
it meant : printing will kill architecture
they promised us a feast of fools , with the election of a pope
mahiette sighed and wiped a tear from her eye
the drinking bowls , rimmed with convex mirrors , multiplied the magnified reflection of things around ; the soldiers pressing around looked at their own reflections with amazement and pulled faces to amuse themselves
this time coppenole bowed with guillaume rym
you will be alone with him
they assured him that they would go back to the others to fulfil them
mâtho restrained a cry
first there appeared people of the local race , then slaves from the countryside
first he spoke about the siege ; but he had only come to relieve his pain by talking about salammbo ; spendius urged him to be sensible
at the bastille saint-antoine , at the palais de justice in paris , at the louvre , these underground constructions were prisons
her mother answered in a feeble voice , and hugging her tightly in her arms smothered her with kisses
at first mâtho had kept himself out of the fight so that he could better exercise command over all the barbarians at the same time
she languished all day long , and revived in the evening
down in the parvis some good women , carrying their milk-jugs , pointed out to each other in astonishment the strangely dilapidated state of the main door of notre-dame , and two congealed streams of lead between the cracks in the sandstone
fat , bearded , eyelids lowered , she seemed to be smiling , with her hands crossed over the edge of her great belly – worn smooth by the kisses of the crowd
they were afraid of knocking something over with their long robes
the usher called sharply
the impressions made on him by objects underwent considerable refraction before reaching his mind
the recluse stood upright with a desperate cry
he threw javelins with frightening speed , letting out at intervals a long shrill whistle ; the great beasts , docile as dogs , looked towards him during the slaughter
at the bottom of byrsa spread a long black mass : it was tanit ’ s temple , an ensemble of monuments and gardens , courtyards and entrance courts , surrounded by a small drystone wall
henriet went back to the provost once more , wholly at a loss
their commander dismounted and came over to her
she had realized that there was a wall all round her , that beneath her was a flagstone covered with water and a bundle of straw
they were at once accepted
then he lifted up to heaven his two empty hands , closed his eyes , and opening his arms like a man throwing himself into the sea from the top of a cliff , he hurled himself upon the pikes
then he had hunted elephants in the forests of the garamantes
down on your knees !
when you say that name , unhappy creature , it is as though you were crushing every fibre in my heart between your teeth !
jehan did not let him finish
he kissed his two thumbs as a token of friendship , blaming his anger on the drunken feast ; then he spoke at length against carthage , but did not say what brought him among the barbarians
which is exactly what he had feared
the solemn lines of the architecture , the religious attitude of all the objects around the girl , the devout and severe thoughts given off , so to speak , by every pore of the stonework , acted on her without her knowing
the building is not typical
today it ’ s my turn , i ’ m going to eat gypsy ! —oh !
many , by some strange aberration , repeated the same word or continually made the same gesture
however , the student joannes was not asleep
it was not an attack by picards or burgundians , not a procession of relics , not a student revolt in the laas vineyard , not our aforesaid most dread sovereign lord the king ’ making his entry , not even the fine spectacle of men and women being hanged for robbery at the palais de justice in paris
my head is ringing like a belfry
beside the pallet was a window , its glass caved in like a spider ’ s web battered by rain , and through the broken lattice could be seen a patch of sky and the moon in the distance , resting on an eiderdown of woolly clouds
he kept his head bent so low on his chest that there was nothing to be seen of his face , covered in shadow , but for the tip of his nose , on which a ray of light fell and which must have been a long one
yet her song breathed joy above all , and she seemed to sing , like a bird , out of serene and carefree happiness
according to spendius , they must wait
they ’ re watching a hundred faggots burn ; a fine entertainment !
soldiers leapt up to free them and disappeared
but the man in black finally straightened up , gripped the oars again , and continued upstream
he would have brought for her from the country of the negroes things which did not exist in carthage , and the apartments of their house would be strewn with gold dust
the archdeacon , however , had not even stood up for this person
the punic square split up ; three columns were swallowed up , swirling beneath the gateway
said gringoire , it ’ s because his father and mother were whimsical people who gave him a taciturn disposition
she doesn ’ t belong to the king !
the bell , in unbridled frenzy , offered to each side of the tower in turn its bronze throat , emitting its tempestuous breath which could be heard four leagues away
but from the side streets an enormous crowd poured out
a nothing , your science of the heavens !
here and there a stone phallus rose up , and big stags wandered about peacefully , kicking fallen pine cones with their cloven hoofs
so far no one lives there , or i should become king of the country
it is the only change a courtier ’ s face can register
the people listened devoutly
a roaster , a pottinger , a sauce-maker , a chief cook , an armoury-keeper , two sumptermen at number livres a month each !
the colleges , which were in fact the intermediate link between the cloister and the world , stood midway in the series of monuments between the mansions and the abbeys , with a severity full of elegance , less frivolous sculptures than the palaces , less earnest architecture than the convents
the sun had gone down behind the lofty tour de nesle
during the last war extortions had increased , so that of the libyan towns , nearly all had given themselves up to regulus
otherwise along the bank of the seine ran either a bare strand , as it was beyond the bernardins , or a clutter of houses with their feet in the water , as between the two bridges
one day finally , or one night ( for midday and midnight were the same colour in this tomb ) she heard above her a louder noise than that usually made by the warder when he brought her her jug and her bread
from time to time a flush of shame , a flash of anger , inflamed her eyes or her cheeks ; a disdainful word seemed to tremble on her lips ; she made her little grimace of contempt , with which the reader is familiar ; but she kept silent
she was not , however , fully reassured
and let not one of them get away except to the gallows of montfaucon
the parvis was resplendent and projected its radiance into the sky
meanwhile the galley tossing among the rocks came alongside the mole , and the crowd followed it along the stone slabs , crying :
salammbo , who was watching them go away , lowered her head , and taanach , thinking she could guess the cause of her grief , said softly to her :
no one now laid down his arms , and the fury of all concentrated on gisco in a frenzy of hate
mâtho was stifling in the heated atmosphere beating down on him from the cedar partitions
its red-fanged jaws gaped open horribly ; its enormous nostrils flared , daylight brought it to life , giving it a terrible , impatient look , as though it would have liked to leap outside , fuse with the star , the god and together with it cover the vastness of space
gradually others appeared , wandering in groups of ten , twelve , twenty-five men ; several of them drove goats or some lame cow
well , now , phoebus went on , you got away very smartly the other evening
there was no spectacle in the world , not chambord , nor the alhambra , more magical , more ethereal , more marvellous than this cluster of spires , turrets , chimneys , weathervanes , spiral staircases , open-work lanterns , looking as though they had been stamped out with a punch , pavilions , spindle-shaped turrets or , as they were then called , tournelles , all of different shapes , height , and altitude
it ’ s a pity , growled the torturer as he looked at such graceful and delicate limbs
as for him , he would not have had the slightest idea where he was had he not noticed in passing , at a bend in the street , the octagonal bulk of the pillory in the halles , its open-work top boldly silhouetted against a window where a light still showed in the rue verdelet
the candles , whose number had not been increased , gave so little light that one could not see the walls of the hall
] ; homo homini monstrum [ man is a monster for man ] ; astra , castra , nomen , numen [ stars , camp , name , divinity ] ; μέγα βιβλίον , μέγα κακóν [ great book , great evil ] ; sapere aude [ dare to know ] ; flat ubi vult [ it bloweth where it listeth ] , etc
but when the gap had closed to three hundred paces the elephants , instead of advancing , turned round ; then the clibanarii wheeled about and followed them ; and the mercenaries ’ surprise increased as they saw all the archers and slingers running to join them
it is a comforting thought , be it said in passing , that the death penalty which , three hundred years ago still cluttered up with its iron wheels , its stone gibbets , its whole apparatus of punishment permanently fixed into the pavement , the grève , the halles , the place dauphine , the croix-du-trahoir , the marché-aux-pourceaux , the hideous montfaucon , the barrière des sergents , the place-aux-chats , the porte saint-denis , champeaux , the porte baudets , the porte saint-jacques , not to mention the countless ladders ’ of the provosts , the bishop , the chapter , the abbots , the priors with rights of jurisdiction ; not to speak of judicial execution by drowning in the river seine ; it is comforting to think that today , having lost one by one all the pieces of her armour , her profusion of torments , her imaginative and fanciful punishments , her torture for which she had a new leather bed made every five years at the grand châtelet , that old sovereign ruler of feudal society , almost expelled from our laws and our towns , hunted from code to code , driven from place to place , has nothing left in all our vast city of paris but one dishonoured corner of the grève , one wretched guillotine , furtive , anxious , ashamed , seemingly always afraid of being caught red-handed , to judge by the haste with which it disappears once it has done its job
he snatched the gypsy girl from the astounded quasimodo ’ s grasp , put her across his saddle , and just as the redoubtable hunchback , recovering from his surprise , rushed at him to take back his prey , fifteen or sixteen archers appeared , following close behind their captain , their great swords at the ready
look , dear brother claude , i would not come to you with any dishonourable intentions
someone had no doubt impelled her ?
the truands turned about in alarm
mathias hungadi shook his head
apart from the pikes on their chest harness , the spikes on their tusks , bronze plates covering their sides , and daggers fastened on their knee pads – at the end of their trunks they had a leather ring holding the handle of a large cutlass ; starting off all together from the end of the plain , they advanced from each side , in parallel lines
sonant melliflua hymnorum organa , suavissima angelorum melodia , cantica canticorum mira !
since the morning in the pillory , it had seemed to the people living near notre-dame that they could detect a considerable cooling-off in quasimodo ’ s ardour for ringing the bells
on the right side of his throat spurted a stream of blood ; at once delirium began
first of all we feel a buzzing in our ears , our eyes are dazzled
narr ’ havas was already coming towards him
his protruding angles fitted , if we may be allowed the comparison , the concave angles of the building , and he seemed to be not just its denizen but its natural contents
suddenly he saw on the horizon , behind tunis , what looked like wisps of fog , trailing along the ground ; then there was a great curtain of grey dust extending vertically , and in the eddies of this numerous throng appeared the heads of dromedaries , lances , shields
on a pillory the spectacle was sublime
maître simon sanguin , elector of picardy , with his wife on the pillion
but on top of the walls rose long cranes used for fitting ships ’ masts ; and from them came down enormous claws ending in two semi-circles toothed inside
when he came down on to the platform between the towers , his ideas were all mixed up in his head
he let out a violent cry , like a wretch being burned by the red-hot iron
laden dromedaries moved down the ramps
in the form of printing , thought is more imperishable than ever ; it is volatile , elusive , indestructible
i will make her die , spendius !
motionless , with head bowed , she looked at the soldiers
he had just caught sight of the student
he was sorry not to have deserted to the romans with the two thousand gauls of the temple of eryx
and then there was this fine report in latin which the under-monitor of torchi brought piteously to dom claude with the distressing marginal note : rixa , prima causa vinum optimum potatum [ brawl , main cause : excellent wine drunk ]
there each individual work , however fanciful and isolated it may seem , has its place and its projection
that in any case is one tradition of the gaols and galleys which has not been abandoned , and which handcuffs still preciously preserve among us , a civilized , gentle , humane people ( hard labour and the guillotine in parentheses )
they wanted to run upon the barbarians at once ; the suffete made them rest for two hours
give me back my child !
i am the author of the mystery performed today , with great success and attended by a great throng of people in the great hall of the palais , no less
gringoire had managed to find out that when she was still very small she had travelled through spain and catalonia and as far as sicily ; he thought she had been taken , in the zingari caravan of which she was part , to the kingdom of algiers , a country situated in achaea , the said achaea bordering on one side lesser albania and greece , and on the other the sicilian sea , which is the way to constantinople
between the rue vieille and the rue neuve du temple lay the temple , a sinister cluster of towers , tall , upright , and isolated amid a huge crenellated enclosing wall
then , i ’ m desperately sorry , but i must fulfil the duties of my office
it was a semicircle of rags , tatters , tinsel , pitchforks , hatchets , legs unsteady with wine , great bare arms , sordid , lacklustre , besotted faces
she thought of all the beauty in life , youth , the sight of the sky , aspects of nature , love , phoebus , of all that was fleeing away from her and all that was coming closer , the priest denouncing her , the executioner who was coming , the gibbet standing there
at this shameless declaration the archdeacon ’ s features took on an entirely pedagogic and paternal expression
none of the furniture of an ordinary apartment was to be found in this room , no benches , no trestles , no forms , no common box stools , no fine stools supported on pillars and counter-pillars at number sols each
old men carried the wounded , and pious people continued the token funerals of their relatives and friends , who had died far away during the war
for the rest he was a good fellow
when he pulled the child out of the bag he found that it was indeed badly deformed
but not a sparkle of gold
good , another light of love !
now i ’ m going away
if i ’ d known , i ’ d have given you virgin marys , you nosy idlers !
the unclean-eaters , acting as referees , said they were being cheated
meanwhile windows had opened again
they could not deliberate about war : and when they were beaten the grand council crucified them
he did not answer
have him choked in the dungheap
erat enim ut si mundus , ipse excutiendo semet , rejecta vetustate , candidam ecclesiarum vestem indueret ( glaber radulphus )
quand à paris dame justice ,
i was once very rich , and i spent all i had
while she was asleep !
the night just past was precisely a saturday
some took rope ends which they lit for torches
they stayed shut up in the third enclosure , as inexpugnable as a fortress
do you want her to pay you on the nose ?
with its great ebony staircase going straight up , the prow of a defeated galley fixed in the corners of each step , with its scarlet doors quartered with a black cross , its bronze grills as protection against scorpions below , and its trellisses of gilded rods blocking apertures above , it seemed to the soldiers , in its savage opulence , to be as solemn and impenetrable as hamilcar ’ s own features
the storeys of these prisons , as they plunged deeper into the earth , became darker and more cramped
is it the gypsy he ’ s looking at like that ?
that ’ s the best we ’ ve got
she had , moreover , quite ceased seeing , or hearing , anything of quasimodo
the crowd opened , and let through a pure , dazzling figure
to make a wide enough opening they had only to dislodge one course of stone underneath the window
that poor little dancer with her goat !
and then , did it count for nothing to have supreme authority over the sergeants of the douzaine , the keeper and watch of the châtelet , the two auditors of the châtelet , auditores castelleti , the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen districts , the gaoler of the châtelet , the four hereditary sergeants , the hundred and twenty mounted sergeants , the hundred and twenty sergeants of the wand , or catchpoles , the captain of the watch with his watch , under-watch , counter-watch and rear-watch ?
that makes quite a fair portion of my town !
the duke of egypt , without uttering a word , brought up a clay pitcher
at last they arrived on the upper platform
but the carthaginians were reluctant to obey him , finding it so enjoyable to stick their swords into the barbarians ’ bodies
they grew restive , hunching their shoulders as though being scourged – you do not even know if he is alive or dead !
the gypsy looked at the hilt , the blade , examined with adorable curiosity the cipher on the guard , and kissed the sword , telling it : you are the sword of a brave man
that gypsy , as you know , who comes to the parvis every day to dance , despite the official ’ s prohibition
the eleven steps up to the portal were packed with them
what is suitable for a legate , the stranger said rather dryly , is not suitable for a princess
he drove back the gauls and all the barbarians found themselves virtually besieged
in the light of a moonbeam escaping between the clouds spendius saw a gaping wound in the middle of the arm
gringoire blocked up his ears
the old woman treated him like a lord , and put the gold piece away in a drawer
down with the six theologians in their white surplices !
at the corner of an oleander copse her horse reared up at a man ’ s corpse lying on the ground
finding the ladders inadequate they used tollenones – devices consisting of one long beam set transversally on another , and bearing at its end a square basket in which thirty infantrymen and their weapons could find room
you must agree that i ’ m no fool
it would be better to take his revenge later through some trick ; so he signed to his soldiers and slowly withdrew
it was like some poor , sinful soul being questioned by satan beneath the crimson wicket-gate of hell
go on , go on , said the cardinal , it ’ s all the same to me
the only light that quasimodo could see was at the window of a distant building , whose vague and sombre profile stood out well above the roof-tops , over towards the porte saint-antoine
salammbo went up to the terrace of her palace , supported by a slave-girl carrying burning coals in an iron tray
cried the captain , half kneeling
that was all it needed
isn ’ t that worth something ?
adultery is curiosity about the sensual pleasure of another … oh !
however hamilcar bitterly regretted being unable to communicate with the king of the numidians , whom he knew to be behind the barbarians and ready to fall on them
behind him , higher than a catafalque , rose a huge chest , fitted with hanging rings like crowns
fleur-de-lys put her hands over her eyes so that she would not see
at utica , spendius ’ army had just gone , and the inhabitants were beginning to burn the machines
her eyes were dry and burning
pile it up and keep it !
all he did , and it was another way of interrogating the archdeacon , was to follow the direction of his line of sight , and in that way the eye of the unfortunate deaf man fell on the place de grève
from the street of khamon to the herb-market the whole perimeter path now belonged to the barbarians , and the samnites finished off the dying with their pikes ; or , with one foot on the wall , they looked down below at the smoking ruins , and the battle starting again in the distance
they couldn ’ t go after them
twelve hours later all that remained of the mercenaries was a heap of wounded , dead and dying
it is humanity ’ s mode of expression totally renewed , human thought discarding one form and putting on another , it is the complete and definitive change of skin of that symbolic serpent which , ever since adam , has represented intelligence
clopin came up to him
diamond discs were sprinkled over its long blue robe , and chains , buried under flagstones , fastened it by the heels to the ground
then the tables were covered with meat dishes : antelopes with their horns , peacocks with their feathers , whole sheep cooked in sweet wine , haunches of she-camels and buffaloes , hedgehogs in garum , fried grasshoppers and preserved dormice
in fact the soldiers recalled a loud cry ; spendius , who had fled at the head of the columns , had not heard it
for a box of grease for greasing the king ’ s boots—number deniers
the captain picked up a corner of the tapestry : who , fair cousin , is this stout soldier blowing a trumpet with all his might ?
yes , it ’ s my pruning hook
they crept along the nopal hedges bordering the paths
jehan coldly replied : here are the pebbles i pave my fob with
he armed their drivers with a mallet and chisel , so that they could smash their skulls if they stampeded in combat
there , i ’ ve put myself behind the wall
at last a man tottering , pale , and hideous with terror , pushed a child ; then a small black mass could be seen in the hands of the colossus ; it was swallowed up in the dark opening
the carthaginians had not tried to pursue the barbarians
mâtho ordered all the women to be driven away ruthlessly
a man went by , plodding along as oxen do
there were two of us
but the continual uncertainty in which he kept them eventually annoyed them more than any defeat
it was the gypsy girl
a great tumult surrounded the town
a violent conflict raged in his mind , in which , like jupiter in the iliad , he weighed up the gypsy and the goat in turn ; and he looked at them , one after the other , his eyes moist with tears , as he said between his teeth : yet i can ’ t save you both
so they were going round the world in a search and quest for this beauty , and having rejected successively the queen of golconda , the princess of trebizond , the grand khan of tartary ’ s daughter etc , etc , husbandry and trade , nobility and clergy had come to rest themselves on the marble table of the palais de justice , while they uttered before the worthy audience all the sentences and maxims which could at that time be dispensed in the faculty of arts in the examinations , sophisms , determinations , figures , and acts at which masters were capped for their degrees
a stifling atmosphere filled this mystic place
as he went towards the purple works , he passed by the slave prison , a long house of black stone built inside a square pit , with a little path all round it and four stairways at the corners
in that case it is because the people ’ s hour has not come
she was dressed in white , and had a white veil over her head
women stretched out on the corpses , mouth to mouth , brow to brow ; they had to be beaten to drive them back , when the earth was thrown over the dead
the catapult rolled to the edge of the platform ; and , carried away by the load on its shaft , it fell , smashing the lower storeys beneath it
our purple fisheries are pretty well exhausted , even pearls are becoming exorbitant ; we barely have enough unguents for the service of the gods !
he still owes me money for my epithalamium , and he came within an ace of having me hanged this evening , which i should have found most embarrassing
she relapsed into a thoughtful silence
he likewise passed through all the degrees in arts , from bachelor to master to doctor
besides , the barbarians were countless and once their weariness was past they would begin again
at night he sat beside their pit , and in their groans found something of the voice that filled his heart
how much more solid , durable , and resistant a book is a building !
there too was a big armchair and a big table , compasses , alembics , animal skeletons hanging from the ceiling , a sphere rolling on the floor , horse-heads all mixed up with jars containing quivering gold leaves , skulls lying on sheets of vellum , covered with a medley of figures and letters , thick manuscripts lying open , piled up , heedless of the brittle corners of the parchment , in short all the rubbish of science , and lying everywhere on this jumble a layer of dust and cobwebs ; but there was no luminous circle of letters , no doctor in ecstasy gazing at the flaming vision as an eagle looks at the sun
it was a daunting exordium
he is bishop of amiens , is he not ?
the captain , much more occupied with her than with that heap of riff-raff , was amorously rumpling her waist-band from behind
gringoire began eating ravenously
it seems to me , i tell you , that you heard the clatter of their clogs running off to the south , while you ran north
she just strode about the cell , stopping periodically to rip out handfuls of grey hair , and then tore them with her teeth
one of the boys had just said : it ’ s because they are going to hang a gypsy woman today
perhaps blind , added gervaise
just now slim and curving , you glide through space like a galley without masts , or in the middle of your stars you are like a shepherd guarding his flock
he said through grinding teeth
quasimodo , shaking with excitement , followed it with his eyes
then he was transported with joy at the thought of seeing salammbo again
i don ’ t just know your name , the man in the cloak went on in his sepulchral voice
from it they brought in triumph the blessed pope of fools
the inquisitive student took advantage of this to spend a few minutes examining the cell at his leisure
in the centre of the tall , gothicnumber façade of the palais was the grand staircase ; up and down it flowed continuously a double stream , breaking on the central flight of steps , and then spreading out in broad waves over its two lateral flights
without waiting for the slaves they quickly undid the baskets ; there they found hyacinth-coloured robes , sponges , scrapers , brushes , perfumes , and antimony pencils for painting the eyes ; all this belonging to the guards , rich men accustomed to such refinements
repeated salammbo ; she fell into a reverie , with her elbow resting on the ivory chair
cried the scholar in a tone as gracious as that of a hungry mastiff disturbed at its bone
beyond gades , a voyage of twenty days , there is an island covered in gold dust , greenery and birds
there was the maison-aux-piliers , opening on to the place de grève , of which we have already given the reader some idea
a clay lamp burned softly against the tent-pole , where the zaïmph shone in the panoply hanging there
more and more gaps grew in the carthaginian cohorts , their machines became stuck in the sand ; finally the suffete ’ s litter ( his great litter with its crystal pendants ) , which had been visible from the start , rocking among the soldiers like a ship at sea , suddenly sank from sight
the first impact of the clapper on the bronze wall made the timber frame on which it was mounted quiver
poor dear little shoe !
they broke through the attackers ’ line , and began to flee in every direction , leaving the parvis heaped with their dead
all that the blood-red glow from the furnace lit up throughout the room was a jumble of horrible things
meanwhile what has become of printing ?
it was the mean lamp which day and light lit up the public breviary of notre-dame , beneath its iron mesh
isn ’ t it true that my fleur-de-lys is adorably beautiful and you are madly in love with her ?
the most obstinate penetrated the suffete ’ s tent ; they tried to soften him by taking his hands , making him feel their toothless gums , their skinny arms , their wound scars
and their voices were lost in the explosion of instruments sounding all at the same time , to drown the cries of the victims
finally they recognized hamilcar ’ s trireme
right , said gringoire , without a horse you can ’ t be a man
it was a joy forbidden on pain of death in the punic armies , and they raised their cup towards carthage in derision at its discipline
by working one can bend fortune
soon they were only fifty , then twenty , then only three , then two , a samnite armed with an axe and mâtho , who still had his sword
he was still laughing as he emerged into the square
all the other tollenones were rapidly in position
he was made to kneel on the circular planks , he let them do it
i could go through flames , walk over the sea !
as soon as they went into a wood , the trees burst into flames around them ; when they drank from a spring , it was poisoned ; they found the caves walled up where they hid to sleep
spendius found a plant with large leaves abundantly full of juice , and , declaring that it was poisonous to keep the others away , fed on it
the faces were all half hidden by the helmet visors ; bronze cnemides covered all the right legs ; broad cylindrical shields came down to their knees ; and this fearful square mass moved as one , seemed to have an animal life and work like a machine
the mercenaries understood this ; so their indignation burst out into threats and excesses
leaving behind him the tournelle civile and the tour criminelle , and following the great wall of the king ’ s gardens along the unpaved river bank where the mud came up to his ankles , he came to the westernmost tip of the city , and stayed for a while looking at the little island of the cow-ferryman , passeur-aux-vaches , which has since disappeared beneath the bronze horse and the pont-neuf
you must then more than once ( and speaking for myself , i have spent whole days at it , the most profitable of my life ) have followed from bush to bush , beside a running brook , on a sunny day , some lovely green or blue dragonfly , darting in zigzag flight , kissing the tip of every branch
then the pools of water became more frequent
then gringoire saw a pretty little white she-goat come up , nimble , lively , glossy , with gilded horns , gilded hooves , a gilded collar ; he had not noticed it before , for it had remained crouching up till then on a corner of the carpet , watching its mistress dance
it was the archdeacon
come up by me , said the suffete , suspecting some fraud : how many years have you served ?
others slipped up to the enemy front-lines and came to steal food from under the tents ; the barbarians , quite dumbfounded , sometimes let them go back
she said , burying her face in her hands , and shivering as though bitterly cold
picture all the grotesque heads carved on the pont-neuf , those nightmares turned to stone under the hand of germain pilon , taking on life and breath , and coming one by one to stare at you with burning eyes ; all the masks from the venice carnival passing one after the other before your spyglass ; in a word , a human kaleidoscope
it polishes itself around you , and it is the movement of your pulsing which distributes the winds and fertile dews
however , all these nuances , all these differences affect only the surface of the buildings
mâtho still held her little hands in his ; and from time to time , despite the priest ’ s orders , she turned her face away and shook her arms in an attempt to get rid of him
all the hounds in the pack are there !
and , addressing the torturer : have the prisoner unfastened and brought back to the hearing
then they heard a noise like a bone box bursting against a wall , and saw something fall , until it was caught a third of the way down on a projection of the architecture
from all sides guffaws of laughter and obscene songs could be heard
at last night fell : a moonless night , a dark night
some even urged them not to leave the city , with calculated exaggeration and hypocritical daring
you never saw a more triumphant beast in all the woods ’
all the hideous phantoms , pierrat torterue , jacques charmolue , faded from her mind , all of them , even the priest
fleur-de-lys was his last passion but one , a pretty girl , with a delightful dowry ; so one fine morning , completely cured , and fully supposing that after two months the affair of the gypsy girl must be over and forgotten , the amorous cavalier pranced up to the door of the gondelaurier mansion
not only did messire robert d ’ estouteville have his personal right of justice as provost and viscount of paris , he also had a share , as spectator and participant , in the king ’ s high justice
elsewhere they imagined that the barbarians had entered the city
moreover , i am fortunate enough to spend all my days from morning to evening with a man of genius , namely myself , and that ’ s most agreeable
in the evening they stretched out on the tents without unfolding them ; and as they fell asleep looking up at the stars they thought back with longing to hamilcar ’ s feast

spendius called them to witness the things he said ; then he raised his fists in the direction of hamilcar

the pope of fools had been elected
it is never too late to pay a call on so notable a scholar as dom claude frollo de tirechappe , replied doctor coictier , with a franche-comté accent which dragged out every sentence as majestically as a robe with a train
as soon as the suffete was in the town the notables came to greet him
the crowd in the parvis seemed to be growing thicker every moment

my fair cousin of burgundy did not grant arms on a field of gules
they all stayed silent
that is why we call on you to hand the girl over to us if you want to save your church , otherwise we shall take the girl and sack your church
the rumour went round the university that the rue tirechappe had been especially devastated by the sickness
but she had over her face a yellow veil with black flowers and so many draperies round her body that it was impossible to guess anything about her
from egypt , said the judge
anyone can see you are from reims if you don ’ t know that !
he begged her not to permit this sacrilege
then , as they had to live , as a taste for this food had developed , as they were dying , they slaughtered the water-carriers , the grooms , all the mercenaries ’ servants
the certainty that schahabarim expressed the gods ’ will then became something of which she was fully conscious

your singing was even more enchanting than your dancing
what secret thoughts brought such a bitter smile to his lips at the same moment as his frowning brows came closer together like two bulls about to fight ?
one mother had an emperor , another a pope , another a captain
those who had received their money demanded more for their horses ; and the vagabonds , the outlaws , took the soldiers ’ weapons and claimed that they had been forgotten
suddenly he collapsed like something falling to pieces , and remained motionless on the ground , his head between his knees
already from the towers aloft came down a shower of javelins , arrows , fire-darts , masses of lead : some tried to climb up by clinging to the fringes of the caparisons
he went on speaking as he armed himself :
the colleges of pontiffs would not forgive him for seizing their treasure , and they demanded that the grand council should undertake to crucify him if he should ever come back

that was sacrilege ; but he was past caring about such trifles
then the clerk began writing ; then he handed the president a long parchment scroll
two cohorts of elephants were regularly drawn up on either side ; as they twitched they shook off the arrows sticking into their black skin

before he could make a move spendius had rushed on him , and gripping him with his arms plunged both daggers into his ribs
the barbarians picked up stones ; they all fled ; and all that could be seen on top of the mountain were the tips of the lances coming over the edge of the stockade
but the impetus had been provided , the king of tunis setting an example—it was surely the bishop defending himself , and that only made them batter at the door the more furiously , despite the stones which were shattering skulls to right and left
when day broke , they were in the mountains of ariana , at the spot where the road makes a sharp bend
old barbedienne really lays it on—deaf to argument as he is !
after all this he turned towards mankind only with reluctance

to the right the vast semicircle of the town , much more of a mixture with its gardens and monuments
paris is a splendid and attractive sight , the paris of those days especially , seen from the top of the tower of notre-dame in the fresh light of a summer dawn
you stand before three mighty sovereigns : me , clopin trouillefou , king of tunis , successor to the great coësre , supreme suzerain of the kingdom of argot ; matthias hunyadi spicati , duke of egypt and bohemia , that yellow old chap you see over there with a duster round his head ; guillaume rousseau , emperor of galilee , that fat fellow who isn ’ t listening to us , there fondling a harlot
you ’ ll be able to see all you want from the dog kennel next to it
this was a ray of light
the captain was very smartly dressed , with knots of braid at collar and cuffs—the height of elegance at the time

he was born in the gulf of syrtes
the renaissance was not impartial ; it was not content with putting up , it wanted also to pull down
if you only knew what a good boy he is !
don ’ t tell me that the undertaking is impossible !
i don ’ t know , she replied
tell me , this life that you make so delightful for yourself , who preserved it for you ?
he bellowed , foamed at the mouth , bit , and , if it had been daytime , there can be no doubt that his face alone , made even more hideous by anger , would have put the whole squadron to flight
she was accompanied by a little white goat with gilded horns , and carried a tambourine in her hand
here is the shoe , but where ’ s the foot ?
let him hang , and say thank you for it !
i ’ m a truand , christ ’ s belly !

so complaints against the rigours of the times become murmurings against the prince
children were burned on the forehead or the back of the neck with wicks of wool ; and as this means of satisfying baal brought in a lot of money to the priests , they invariably recommended it as the easiest and mildest
he rounded the tip of the îie notre-dame , and made for the landing stage at the port-au-foin
what a lovely noise !
there are halberdiers , crossbowmen , and culverineers
he caught up with another of these moving shapes and examined it
you are going to explain a lot of things to me
the gigantic shadow of the church towers went from roof to roof , from one end of the great city to the other
i have made them , said the hosier
the cardinal ’ s spirits rose a little ; he had now got even with coppenole , and also won applause for his pun
just as he caught up with them , they had changed the subject
popular genius and originality took on the task the bishops used to perform
the morning light was filtering in through cracks in the wall ; the three bodies , lying on their chests , were streaming blood like three fountains , and a sheet of blood covered the mosaics , which had been sprinkled with blue powder
meanwhile pierrat torterue was shaking out over the pavement the thongs of his whip , all reddened and soaked with blood
he brushed the dust from her boots ; he wanted her to put a segment of pomegranate between her lips ; he piled up clothes behind her head to make a cushion for her
he had thought that the mercenaries would wait for him at utica or come back against him ; and finding his forces insufficient either to launch or sustain an attack , he had driven down into the south , along the right bank of the river , which protected him immediately from surprise
she pushed the body round with the end of her sandal for a while , and the slave was amazed at her lack of emotion
at last they recognized the houses of megara
yes , i think i did , fair cousin , said the captain
what is keeping you ?
i ’ ll take you in to her
it was a vast open square , irregular and badly paved like all the paris squares at that time
i ’ d just as soon , corbœuf , gargle with a basket !
as hamilcar ’ s kitchens were not sufficient , the council had sent them slaves , tableware , beds : and in the middle of the garden , as on a battlefield when the dead are being burned , appeared huge , bright fires where oxen roasted
and yet i had thought out what i was going to say to you
but it can ’ t be helped , my reverend master
we are delighted to be able to inform our readers that during the whole of this scene gringoire and his play had stood fast
so i was an orphan at number , with nothing beween my bare feet and the pavements of paris
whether there is or not , no matter !
the slave showed her a handful of gold pieces
there was no way out !

meanwhile the other spectators were grumbling like him
he seized her arm , he was distraught , he tried to drag her along
that was just the time my husband bought the tabellionage of beru , two leagues from the town , and we didn ’ t concern ourselves with the story any more ; and on top of that there are the two hills of cernay lying in front of beru which block the view of the towers of reims cathedral
in the deserted quarters , far from the walls , the less indigent inhabitants had barricaded themselves in for fear of the others
several had red sores on their faces ; this came , they thought , from touching hanno
finally they had regained confidence , had gradually moved forward , come closer ; and now men from the eastern regions stood in the dunes of clypea , on the other side of the gulf
they think i am dead , don ’ t they ?
meanwhile the calloused hands of pierrat torterue ’ s assistants had brutally stripped the charming leg , the dainty foot which had so often filled passers-by with wonder at their grace and beauty in the streets of paris
one of the young rascals on the window suddenly cried , la esmeralda !
the gardens were empty , and the red door with its black cross remained constantly closed
this was a shrewd , intelligent , cunning face , a sort of cross between a monkey and a diplomat , towards which the cardinal advanced three paces and bowed low , and yet whose name was just guillaume rym , counsellor and pensionary of the town of ghent
she was sleeping with one hand under her cheek and the other arm straight out
gisco , their general , had however been wise enough to send them away one after another to make it easier for them to be paid , and the council had believed that they would end by agreeing to a cut
jehan then recognized his brother
so that he can lead them , someone said
fed on sacrificial meats , dressed in purple like kings and wearing triple tiaras , they spat on this pale eunuch worn out by fasting , and angry laughs shook their black beards , spread over their chests like the rays of the sun
she suddenly cried out , what ’ s that moving against my legs ?
i can stand that comparison !
he arrived right at the foot of the terrace
after all , we wish you no harm
the gesture brought gringoire back to reality
he still had to undergo the extra hour in the pillory which florian barbedienne had so judiciously added on to the sentence of messire robert d ’ estouteville ; all to the greater glory of the old physiological and psychological wordplay of john comenius : surdus absurdus [ deaf , absurd ]
monsieur the provost and monsieur the captain of the watch , who have just come from the riot , are there to give me the lie if that is not the truth
marafin sacked it …
it did not give

the resentful barber too wore a look of dismay , but with underlying satisfaction
her large eyes stared at you , and a luminous stone , set into an obscene symbol on her forehead , lit up the whole room , being reflected above the door on mirrors of red copper
mâtho walked about gesticulating in annoyance
imagine , my good friends , i thought she was dead
sculpture became statuary , imagery became painting , the canon became music
now , at the moment when the door opened for the cardinal , gringoire ’ s nine parts of self-esteem , inflated and puffed up by the breath of popular admiration , were in a state of prodigious enlargement , causing that imperceptible molecule of self-interest which we identified a moment ago in the constitution of poets , to disappear as if smothered ; a precious ingredient , moreover a ballast of reality and humanity without which poets ’ feet would never touch the ground
hey there , colette la charonne !
at last the standards of the republic appeared , that is blue wooden poles , topped by horses ’ heads or pine cones
sigeani ! —may this nail open the grave to anyone bearing the name phoebus !
at last , in a hoarse and hideous voice , he said :

abdalonim , bring me the accounts of the ships , and of the caravans ; of the farms and of the house !

the moon ’ s feeble beams gave sky and earth an ashen hue
not a single carthaginian showed himself ; they were already two thirds of the way up the rampart
he was pleased that night had fallen ; he was longing to find some dark lonely alley where he could ponder at leisure and where the philosopher could apply first aid to the wound suffered by the poet
mâtho did not hear ; he gazed at her and for him her clothes were fused with her body
he thought of all that had come about in his existence since the last time he had passed that way !
a loophole pierced in the circular staircase wall opposite enabled him to see its huge lock and mighty iron frame
libyans came in large numbers , peasants ruined by taxes , outlaws , criminals
during the day you will stay here ; at night you can go wherever you like in the church
he was followed by two pages carrying the king ’ s toilet articles and clothes ; but what struck louis xi was the fact that he was also accompanied by the provost of paris and the captain of the watch , who appeared quite dismayed
i ’ m thinking about it , sire
it is worthy of note that during all this torment the idea of dying never seriously occurred to him
that hydra of towers , a giant keeping guard over paris , with its two dozen heads always alert , its monstrous hindquarters sheathed in lead or scales of slate , glistening with metallic reflections , came as a surprising conclusion to the town ’ s western configuration
in this way the elders avoided having an extra master , and they had not failed to obey this custom in hamilcar ’ s case
mercy , which is the same as clemency , makes for loving subjects , a prince ’ s most powerful bodyguard

finally he threw his cap roughly to the ground and exclaimed : too bad !
that resentment did not lessen when she saw the captain , enchanted by the gypsy and above all with himself , spin on his heel as he repeated with the crude , naïve gallantry of a soldier : a lovely girl , upon my soul !
the ground rose again , and houses came closer together
said the king , i am really in great pain , compère
by the corbignolles of the blessed virgin !
it was the gypsy girl whom he had tried to abduct the previous night , an assault for which he dimly felt he was being punished at that very moment ; which anyhow was not remotely the case , since he was being punished only for the misfortune of being deaf and having come before a deaf judge
when they reminded him that they had been promised ships , he swore by moloch to provide them himself , at his own expense , and tearing off his necklet of blue stones , threw it into the crowd as a pledge of his oath
string up the players and the cardinal !
the two suffetes are in agreement ; this one is tricking you !
it was at this college that he had embarked on what he called his studies and from a habit acquired as an irreverent student and never given up , he never went by the façade without inflicting on the statue of cardinal pierre bertrand , carved to the right of the gate , the kind of affront of which priapus complains so bitterly in horace ’ s satire : olim truncus enim ficulus [ i was once the trunk of a fig tree ]
said agnès to gauchère , looking at the little creature exposed there , which was squealing and wriggling about on the bed , frightened by so many onlookers

the strong boy is vicious
a cloud of brown dust , stretching straight up , swirled rapidly upward ; the palm trees bent , the sky disappeared , stones could be heard bouncing off the backs of animals ; and the gaul , lips stuck to the hole of his tent , moaned with exhaustion and gloom

they clapped their hands in deafening applause , and the hall was still rocking with cheers by the time jupiter had retired behind his curtain

he was throwing himself about in an incredible frenzy
he was the high priest of tanit , the one who had brought up salammbo
one moonless night he got his elephants and soldiers across the gulf of carthage on rafts
musnier , we ’ ll rumple your wife
his real name was olivier le mauvais [ the bad ]
at night , by torchlight , he supervised the pioneers
then he cut the boat ’ s moorings , pushed it away from the bank with a long hook , and seizing a pair of oars , sat down in the bows , rowing with all his might towards the open water
the assault began again several days in succession – the mercenaries hoping to win through excessive strength and bravery

replied the officer , drawing himself up
abdalonim suddenly spoke from behind the door
such are the abbey of jumiéges , the cathedral of reims , sainte-croix at orléans
it is certain that the spirit atrophies in a defective body

the people of utica did not want to let in such well armed guests
were you not going to assault and pillage quite outrageously your lord the bailiff of the palais ?
from time to time there arrived lines of completely naked men , their arms outstretched , holding each other by the shoulders
at the same time the strange army performed some manœuvres , as if taking up position round the church
that remark was a beam of light for the others
jehan began running across the square , pulling his ladder and crying : to me , lads !
he thought of the folly of eternal vows , the futility of chastity , science , religion , virtue , the pointlessness of god
good stout mademoiselle oudarde
on that score , the great bell was his dearly beloved
coppenole , with his calm , homely composure , brought the king over to the window
people soon hurried round them , and gave them names
it was perhaps the first tear the unfortunate creature had ever shed
she murmured , so softly that no one heard her , oh , my phoebus !
he shouted , sprawled over the bosom of the girl beside him :
at the moment when the truands launched their assault on the church , la esmeralda was sleeping
but don ’ t leave the church day or night
this person , by no means reassured and shaking in every limb , came up to the edge of the marble table , with frequent bows , and the nearer he came the more they looked like genuflexions
seeing that the archdeacon had relapsed into his former immobility , he withdrew his head very quietly and made a noise as of footsteps behind the door , like someone coming and announcing his arrival
jehan , jehan , this will have a bad end
that ’ s it , thibauld , splendid !
only such towns ever become capital cities
that ’ s not our business
the soldiers clapped them on the shoulder , tried to cheer them up
a sudden jolt told them at last that the boat had reached the bank
the apprehension of the rich seemed justified when one day barbarians were seen approaching the walls
first of all i ’ m going to let you in , phoebus told his companion , then i ’ ll go and find my lovely who is supposed to be waiting for me by the petit châtelet
while spendius searched , ferreting about , mâtho , prostrate before the door , implored tanit
you say that we are not a king for reigning dapifero nullo , buticulario nullo [ without carver or butler ]
gringoire has several good ideas ins uccession in the rue des bernardins
dom claude frollo had , however , abandoned neither learning nor the education of his young brother , the two occupations of his life
well , then , she was the daughter of guybertaut , a minstrel on the boats at reims , the same who played before king charles vii at his coronation , when he went down our river vesle from sillery to muison , and madame the maid herself was in the boat
every minute there was some engagement , some fresh alarm ; the towers were burning , the unclean-eaters were jumping up at the stockades ; they cut their hands off with axes ; others ran up ; a hail of metal fell on the tents
a moment later the grave and learned robert mistricole , protonotary to the king , went by with an enormous missal under one arm and on the other his wife ( damoiselle guillemette la mairesse ) , thus having on either side his two governors , spiritual and temporal
one thing is certain : there was not a mind in the crowd , not even his , in turn hero and victim , which could draw any clear conclusion from this connection
she was absorbed in the kind of daydream that somehow prolongs a painful story , and stops only when it has spread the shockwave , vibration by vibration , to the innermost fibres of the heart
in doing wrong one must go the whole way
it ’ s a very fine sight !
he held him by the arm , tightly , as if afraid of losing him ; and the child , whom he was hurting , cried a little as he ran beside him
came a subdued murmur
to begin with , the deaf man paid no attention to him , but finally he turned his head and suddenly straightened up
he it was who refused your weapons to lutatius , still red with the blood of his slaves !
phoebus de châteaupers also came to a tragic end : he got married
despite the calm he affected a violent gesture revealed from time to time his inner turmoil
he ordered the trumpets to sound , and his whole army rushed on the barbarians
she looked in every direction
several even imposed a diet on themselves
matho ’ s memory troubled her intolerably ; it seemed to her that this man ’ s death would free her thoughts , as the cure for viper bites is to crush vipers on the wound
meanwhile the carthaginians , devoured by thirst , had rushed to the cisterns
he was seen leaving her bedroom !
he had never thought – so vast was the gulf separating the two of them – that they might have anything in common
as soon as the sun came up , they started moving over the plain in three lines ; first the elephants , then the light infantry with the cavalry behind , then the phalanx
i have got them !
the soldiers asked for provisions , promising to pay out of the money owing to them
he suspected much more magic than love in this story , probably a witch , perhaps the devil ; a piece of theatre , in short , or , to speak the language of the time , a most unpleasant mystery play , with him playing a very clumsy part , the butt for beatings and ridicule

gringoire , unsure what connection there might be between his speech and this question , was not averse to showing off his erudition
it stood on the last of the long steps leading to the great altar , with bronze horns at each corner
not one voice was raised around the unhappy victim but to mock him for his thirst

you and your word-spinning !
they were sent out of the tent so that they might deliberate
rather let ten thousand barbarians perish than one of us !

if you saw me dying you would only laugh
no one , apart from the marine suffete , could go into the admiralty
and the archdeacon added between his teeth : i ’ ll find you again !
don ’ t you know that it brings death ?
quasimodo was unfortunately not able to hear these words , pronounced with a kind of wild and sombre majesty
by the way , i was forgetting !
the hôtel de ville !
the horses were eaten
why do they give me only night ?
no answer came from inside
in front of him little pyramidal shapes rose up in the darkness , and on the near side of the river , closer at hand , lights lay motionless at ground level
and he has one eye too many , added robin poussepain
after all , the young rascal had a good heart , as any play will illustrate
stone was laid upon stone , these granite syllables were joined , language tried out a few combinations
simple , charitable oudarde , who took her last words to mean that she was still complaining of the cold , answered in all innocence : then you would like a bit of fire ?
our lady knows we have nothing to hide from our good flemish friends
caravans had gone out regularly at the winter equinox
it was early march
that ’ s right , claude answered , apparently absorbed in some profound reflection , standing with his index finger bent against the folio volume from the celebrated presses of nuremberg
he began to adjust to the atmosphere of the place
his curly hair overshadowed his curving brow

at that name the shadow ’ s claw shook phoebus ’ arm furiously
do you think so , compère coictier ?
that ’ s gilbert de suilly , gilbertus de soliaco , chancellor of the collège d ’ autun
she did not speak
according to whether the symbol to be expressed was smiling or sombre , greece crowned her mountains with a temple harmonious to the eye , india ripped open hers to carve out within them those shapeless underground pagodas borne by gigantic rows of granite elephants
the weights they put into their catapults were so excessive that the shafts broke ; the attack was put off
he doubled the advanced posts , planted pitchforks at the bottom of the rampart , buried caltrops in the ground , and ordered the libyans to bring him a whole forest to set fire to and burn carthage like a fox ’ s lair
it was she who dealt the final blow to my mystery play this morning , she who saved my life this evening
he approached his eminence , very much afraid of his displeasure , and stammered out an explanation for the people ’ s unseemly behaviour ; noon had arrived before his eminence , and the players had been forced to begin without waiting for his eminence
he added , with the expression of a profound thinker : one is obliged , sometimes to fortune , sometimes to cunning , for the happy outcome of great enterprises
jehan , jehan , my friend !
she went on through the cypress avenue , and walked slowly between the tables where the captains stood back a little as they watched her pass
am i a child ?
mâtho tried to seize it
but great scholar that you are , are you so learned that you no longer believe in science ?
it was a room at street level , quite spacious and very low , with a vaulted ceiling whose central springing rested on a massive wooden pillar painted yellow
suddenly , right in the middle of a period , he broke off , and his expression , usually quite gentle and even stupid , became thunderous : messieurs , he cried ( this time in french , for it was not in his text ) , satan is so much involved in this affair that there he is , present at our proceedings and aping their majesty
again she fell back
abdalonim followed him ; his knees were shaking
from all this seething throng rose , like steam from a furnace , a sharp , shrill , piercing , high-pitched buzz like the wings of a gnat
this was no parthenon , nor temple of olympian jupiter
the poorly armed truands foamed at the mouth and bit
the archdeacon stayed undecided for a moment ; then gave a bleak smile which seemed to belie his answer : credo in deum
sand from the sea , probably blown by the wind through the door , slightly whitened the round stones placed in the niches
the boat , left to itself , drifted for a moment or two with the stream
give me back my child !
not that we withhold from them the admiration which is their due
the crowd broke into fresh applause
he repeated : a woman , even if she were a king ’ s daughter , and i will swiftly lay your desire at your feet
go , tristan my friend !
then they demanded to be paid in cash ( in silver pieces and not leather money ) for all the corn that was owing to them , and at the highest price at which it had been sold during the war , so that for a measure of flour they demanded four times more than they had given for a bag of corn
through a long chamber they entered another similar room

he used his torch to light a miner ’ s lamp fixed to the idol ’ s cap ; the room was suddenly lit up with a blaze of green , yellow , blue , violet , purple , crimson fires

mechanically , and with a charmingly awkward gesture , she was tracing random patterns on the seat with her fingertip and looking at her finger
the lower rooms were indeed full of materials
it was like dismembering an empire on the death of its alexander , with all its provinces becoming kingdoms
a murmur ran through the crowd
down , down , you go !
it was like a layer of living monsters on top of the stone monsters of the façade
others sucked a pebble
thus all the misfortunes came from the loss of the zaïmph
pulsus creber , anhelans , crepitans , irregularis [ rapid pulse , gasping , rattling , irregular ] , the doctor continued
the rich crowded there every day to debate their interests and those of the government , from the search for pepper to the extermination of rome
for them any attempt at improvement is impiety
the level plain became motionless again
so she ran back in terror to cower in her cell , asking her pallet for a nightmare less full of horror
but most often the insults went unnoticed by priest and bell-ringer
a noisy throng of people filled the streets from morning to evening ; boys , shaking bells , cried at the door of the baths ; steam rose from hot drink stalls , the air resounded with the din of anvils , white cocks sacred to the sun crowed on the terraces , oxen bellowed in the temples as they were butchered , slaves ran carrying baskets on their heads ; and in the depths of a portico appeared a priest , draped in a dark mantle , barefoot , and with a pointed hat
bring him to me !
the hangman studied the mother ’ s fingernails and did not dare
the gypsies had gone
in this voluntary abdication of one ’ s own free will , in this fancy submitting to another ’ s quite unsuspecting fancy , there is a mixture of capricious independence and blind obedience , an indefinable middle term between slavery and freedom , which was to gringoire ’ s liking , with his essentially mixed , indecisive and complex mind , holding tenuously to every extreme , suspended between every human propensity , cancelling out one by another
the first monuments were simply chunks of rock which iron had not touched ’ , as moses puts it
then farmland became more scattered
you ’ ll see her in a minute or two at her little window on the grève
a secret desire for reconciliation came through in this gentle invitation to join her and in her careful use of his name
at the entry to khamon , hamilcar could be seen
bédieul the philosophers ’ stone means no more to me than a pebble , and i ’ d rather find an omelette of easter egg and bacon on his furnace than the biggest philosophers ’ stone in the world !
without answering she looked slowly around her , then her eyes fixed on the back of the tent where , on a bed of palm branches , lay something blue and sparkling
listen , he said , and she shuddered at the sound of that voice of ill omen which she had not heard for so long
the man in the cloak obeyed without answering a word
for more than a century the houses pressed and piled up one upon another , their level rising like water in a reservoir
the cheerful scamp ’ s face , whose sunny beams had so often brought serenity back to the priest ’ s sombre countenance , was now quite powerless to dispel the mist which lay denser every day over that corrupt , mephitic , stagnant soul
then , heedless of the example or the financial loss , hamilcar said to the servants : ’
then i fall back into the darkness
hamilcar kept walking ; the other followed him , bent , stumbling , head thrust forward
he murmured finally , this is serious indeed
the walls were chalk , the beams on the ceiling were black , there was a broken-down fireplace , spiders ’ webs in every corner , in the middle a rickety flock of unsteady tables and stools , a dirty child in the ashes , and at the back a staircase , or rather a wooden ladder , going up to a trapdoor in the ceiling
and made my cat have a kitten with six paws , yelped an old woman , throwing a tile at him
when she felt his hand she gasped : ugh !
he answered her look : oh !
the part of the rampart extending from the corner of the ports up as far as the cisterns was broken down
as he found himself once more in the places where he had already seen her , the interval of days gone by was erased from his memory
but in three days ’ time justice will take her back from there and she will be hanged in the grève
with lances extended at an angle , the phalanx cut up the barbarians ; two huge sections struggled in confusion ; the wings , with shots from slings and arrows , forced them back on the phalanx
he succeeded in finding its scattered remnants
last came the law clerks , the basoche , with maypoles wreathed in flowers , their black gowns , music fit for a witches ’ sabbath , and great candles of yellow wax
the man in black did not utter a syllable ; he held her firmly and stepped out again more quickly
and with the best of them he hurled himself at the strongpoint
it meant : the printing press will kill the church
they were deposited with the syssitia , companies of merchants who shared a common table
it has a roof almost as flat as in the east , with the result that in winter , when it snows , they sweep the roof , and roofs are assuredly made to be swept
[ truly , these roasters are something amazing ! ]
i am wrong , lights of the baals ; there are some daring men among you !
an enormous beam had just fallen from the skies , crushing a dozen truands on the steps up to the church , and rebounded on the pavement with the noise of a cannon going off , breaking another leg or two in the crowd of beggars , who were pulling back with cries of terror
he wondered what motive could have driven quasimodo to rescue her
there was a good gypsy woman of our people who died last year , and always cared for me like a foster mother
gringoire turned round with a melancholy smile
mâtho went round it , slowly
they trailed like this for three months along the eastern coast , then behind the mountain of selloum and as far as the first sands of the desert
it was appeased on the evening of the fourth day
one of them gave him a great push forward ; mâtho began to walk
their chests cracked like boxes being broken ; each of the elephants ’ steps crushed two ; their great feet sank into the bodies with a twist of the hips which made them look lame
they are cowards , and they only scratch each other with insults
what do you call that woman ?
they arrived in long companies of a hundred each , all with their arms fastened to their backs by a bronze bar which held them by the neck , and the wounded ran too , bleeding as they went ; horsemen , behind them , whipped them on
they stuck spits between their breasts ; they split open their cheeks ; they put crowns of thorns on their heads ; then they linked arms and , surrounding the children , made another large circle which contracted and expanded
who is on trial ?
mâtho quickly snatched it out ; but he was unarmed , he was naked ; finally , picking up the loaded table with both arms , he threw it at narr ’ havas in the midst of the crowd rushing between them
because you are cowardly , greedy , ungrateful , pusillanimous fools !
women , females , is there any one among you , from the witch to her cat , any bawdy wench would like to have this bawdy fellow ?
by some inconceivable inconsistency he could not forgive the young girl for following his orders – schahabarim had guessed all – and obsession with this idea fitted the jealousy caused by his impotence
when this eruption was over , he sat down again , and said with cold , concentrated rage :
then he went back to her , and asked for food
the first rank ran on it up to their backbone , the second washed back over them ; they all fell back , leaving on these dreadful branches human tatters and bloodstained hair
quickly , hide under this furnace and don ’ t breathe
so you pit yourselves against the crown of france , the sanctity of notre-dame , and the peace of this realm !
it ’ s such a tangle that it stops me in my tracks
the soldiers leaned reflectively on their lances , and the others , in the houses , sighed
standing in the middle a kind of black cross could be made out
then she half turned her lovely head and looked at the priest over her shoulder
if you had wanted , though !
the king interrupted : that ’ s enough
said compère coictier , i forgot to say in my initial confusion that the watch picked up two stragglers from the band
after a while i realized that i lacked something whatever i tried ; and when i saw that i was good for nothing , of my own free will i became a poet and composer of rhymes
they are already sufficiently detached from religion to think of their own beauty , to take care over it , to adjust incessantly their adornment of statues and arabesques
he stayed pensive for a few moments before the graceful pair of goat and gypsy girl
but as soon as his heart was vacant on that score , the image of fleur-de-lys returned
on that score , my beauty , we don ’ t agree
don ’ t let them see the clapper
you could no longer hear yourself speak
this man walking towards her attracted her to him
i have had them in the middle of attacks , under ceilings that were crumbling and while the catapult was still vibrating !
tear him to pieces !
yes , the doctor , louis xi went on , strangely goodhumoured , the doctor enjoys even more credit than you
the question startled the gypsy girl
they hung on the ropes , the capstan creaked , and the huge metal capsule slowly moved
the legless man ran
will they sing bergerettes ?
i knew where it was—under the shed of the lieutenant ’ s house—i know a girl there who thinks i ’ m as handsome as cupido—i used her to get the ladder , and now i ’ ve got the ladder , pasque-mahom ! —the poor girl came to let me in just in her nightshirt
but if you stayed there you would cause a famine ; carthage would become insolvent
as they were too hot , they began to work with bare arms , like reapers ; and when they paused for breath , their eyes followed a horseman galloping after a soldier running away in the countryside
two card-players were arguing : knave !
the gypsy had just pulled out of the bag a little shoe exactly matching the other one
barca had entered their land
the noble young ladies were dazzled despite themselves
if it was not a cart , may i be eternally damned and i deny god
but it was right , claimed the cavalrymen , that the republic should indemnify them for their horses ; one claimed to have lost three at this or that siege , another five during a particular march , another fourteen over precipices
that indeed is where the three bridges from the city discharged on the right bank , and bridges produce houses before palaces
against its base , on the ground , lay arranged in a cross large golden shields and monstrous silver vessels , with closed necks of extravagant shape and no possible use ; for it was customary thus to melt down quantities of metal so that damage and even removal were almost impossible
all the temples had just opened at the same time ; from them came out tabernacles mounted on carts or on litters carried by pontiffs
it ’ s a feast day today—thibauld , no slacking
we were to have four years ’ worth
the thought of schahabarim came back to her ; she resigned herself
i assure you , my lady the virgin , my good mistress , that she is a witch who is not worthy of your kind protection
they no longer heard hamilcar ’ s orders
that is how the marvellous art of the middle ages has been treated in almost every country , especially in france
here ’ s my cap for you , chancellor of sainte-geneviève !
there is no need to warn the reader not to take literally the metaphors we are obliged to use here to express the peculiar , symmetrical , immediate , almost consubstantial conjunction of a man and a building
they had to mount the pack-animals ; others clung to the horses ’ tails ; the strong pulled the weak along , and the ligurian corps prodded the infantry with their pikes
he was running about on the gallery quite distraught
the warm applause which had greeted the beginning of his prologue still resounded in his inmost heart , and he was completely absorbed in the kind of ecstatic contemplation with which an author sees his ideas drop one by one from the actor ’ s lips into the silence of a vast audience
the two flemings were whispering
his jealousy prevented him from helping the suffete ; he arrested his spies , hampered all his plans , compromised the scheme
hamilcar choked back a cry , as if he had been burned by a red hot iron ; and he began again pacing round the room like a madman
some people tried to hide their wealth , their goods were sold ; and to shame the avarice of others , he gave sixty sets of armour and gommors of flour , as much on his own account as the ivory-company
the republic , but for you ( he said ) would not be compelled to pay the romans tribute ; and through your excesses you have exhausted its stocks of perfumes , spices , slaves , and silphium , for you are in league with the nomads on the cyrenaican frontier !
a lamp shaped like a galley hung burning far in the depths of the room ; and three rays escaping from its silver keel trembled over the high panels , covered in red paint with black stripes
mâtho was usually one to be led , and his outbursts in the past had soon been over
such an injustice caused annoyance , but there was nothing for it but to give in
all the same he made one more effort
she was about to rise , as tall as the room with open arms
then everyone in turn sticks his head through a hole and pulls faces at the others
there ’ s only its shadow
gradually he slowed down
no doubt , since she takes her lovers from among the mercenaries !
go and rest a while
the priest went on , shaking his head , that ’ s what learning and letters have come to now
at the same time the intermittent clanging of the iron-tipped shafts of the beadles ’ halberds , gradually fading away beneath the bays of the nave , sounded like the hammer of a clock striking the condemned ’ s last hour
clemency is the only virtue which can light up the inside of a great soul
he stopped a beadle who was coming from the cloister : where is the archdeacon of josas ?
it seemed as though there came from him , so at least the exaggerating superstitions of the people held , some mysterious emanation which brought to life all the stones of notre-dame and stirred the inmost vitals of the old church
all the others were enclosed , and could not get out of these lines
the old slave was astonished at these preparations , but yet did not dare ask questions ; and the day came , appointed by schahabarim , when salammbo was to go
although mountains were dangerous for the elephants , hamilcar went into them
all the men she had seen revolted her with their laughs like wild beasts and their crude limbs
then it seemed to him on the contrary that the goddess ’ s vesture depended on salammbo , and a part of her soul floated over it more subtly than a breath ; and he fingered it , smelled it , plunged his face into it , kissed it to give himself the illusion that he could believe himself beside her
the deaf man bowed his head , then went to kneel in front of the gypsy ’ s door
i ’ m shortsighted and couldn ’ t recognize him
hamilcar , like the romans , had a ditch dug round his camp , fifteen paces wide , ten cubits deep ; and with the spoil he threw up a parapet inside on which sharp interlocking pikes were planted
you look like a tennis-ball pedlar , and you come and sit next to me !
the blessed virgin mary , at the corner of the rue mauconseil , may well have caused eustache moubon to die just to that end , and it ’ s silly of you to run away like that , helterskelter like a picard with a frenchman after him , leaving behind the very thing you were chasing after ; and you are a fool !
she surrounds me , she pervades me
once they were outside the cell , a pale moonbeam fell on the priest ’ s face
a halter for the gallows-bird ,
and in the plain , in front of the portcullis and beneath the rocks , they all immediately got up
at that , feeling everything give way beneath him , with only his stiff and weakening hands still holding on to anything , the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout
isn ’ t there a chair here ?
and keep a good hold on your head , my compère , for i swear to you by the cross of saint-lô that if you lie to us now , the sword which cut off monsieur de luxembourg ’ s head is not so chipped that it can ’ t saw yours off as well !
such was the creature who took from her abode the name recluse ’ and from her garment the name sachette ’
behind notre-dame extended , to the north , its cloister with its gothic galleries ; to the south the semi-romanesque bishop ’ s palace ; to the east , the island ’ s empty tip , known as the terrain
he went on : the love of a damned soul !
i tell you , let go of my horse , phoebus replied , losing patience
at least that is how jehan judged it as he heard him cry , with the reflective pauses of a visionary dreaming aloud :
they were seeking some place of refuge , any would do
you are the captain , let me keep my child !
the palace , built of yellow-flecked numidian marble , rose up at the back with its four terraced storeys on massive foundations
the last , narrower , floor made a kind of cube on the top of the terraces
she became confused with the goddess herself , and his love came out all the stronger , like the large lotus flowers blooming on the watery depths
the îie de la cité , in the words of sauval , whose muddled writing contains the occasional felicity of style , the îie de la cité is made like a great ship stuck in the mud and stranded with the current near the middle of the seine
djali stood up on her hindlegs and began bleating as she marched , with such charming gravity that the entire circle of spectators burst out laughing at this parody of the self-centred piety of the pistoleer captain
at least six thousand
all these symbols of fecundation , these perfumes , these sparkling lights , these breaths oppressed him
dom claude shook his wrinkled head : qui non laborat … ’
what the devil is she so interested in ?
day after day went by
i told my father , who spat his curse in my face , my mother , and the old lady fell to weeping and drooling like that log on the firedog
around his waist and his knees he had mud-caked straw and strips of cloth ; his soggy , sickly skin hung from his emaciated limbs like rags on dry branches ; his hands shook with a continual tremor and he walked leaning on a stick of olive-wood
some , however , with their more prominent cheekbones , greater height and narrower feet , betrayed an african origin , nomad ancestors
ptolemy had once refused it , talents
more than once my flesh was excited by a woman ’ s form passing by
and the stone lion standing at the door , head down and tail between his legs , like the lions of solomon ’ s throne , in the humbly submissive posture befitting strength before justice ?
they cried out to have the suffete ’ s head thrown down to them , and stretched out their robes to catch it
so , to encourage the people , the priests drew punches from their belts and tore open their faces
moonlight has that effect
meanwhile the sinister face of the recluse appeared , pressed against the window bars
i must possess , and only i , all the corn in carthage
finally he came up to the bed hanging beside an ebony stool for climbing into it
it had cost too much , and out of pride the patricians of his party gave him limp support
la esmeralda went pale , and came down unsteadily from the pillory
that gypsy steal your child !
street noises did not come that far , and as he went by hamilcar recognized the triremes which he had once commanded
a fine thing indeed !
what sort of people are these , they thought , who amuse themselves by crucifying lions !
so phoebus believed poor similar ’ to be dead , and that already since a month or two back
in the huge open space left between the crowd and the fire , a girl was dancing
sometimes , taanach , the depth of my being gives off gusts of heat , heavier than the fumes of a volcano
dusk fell , balmy perfumes wafted about
then one morning , a little before sunrise ( it was the seventh day of the month of nisan ) they heard a great shout from all the barbarians at once , the trumpets ’ leaden tubes blared , the great paphlagonian horns bellowed like bulls
one morning she woke up with her mind made up , and asked what must be done to get mâtho to return the veil
she had to be content with that explanation
are you not mine ?
to give it back to you !
fleur-de-lys ran to her and gave a start
the brighter carthaginian weapons encircled them like golden crowns ; in the middle was a seething mass , and as the sun struck the sword points it made them flicker , glinting white
they went by way of the street of the tanners , the square of muthumbal , the herb market , and the crossroads of cynasyn
if he were wounded we should hear him !
queue-en-brie was in any case a very dull place to be stationed , a village of blacksmiths and cow-girls with chapped hands , a long ribbon of mean hovels and cottages strung along both sides of the highway for half a league ; in short a queue , or tail
then a white bull was brought in , with a black ewe , symbols of day and night
he cried as he fell , and lay like a dead man with his face to the ground
little girl , get your goat to do a miracle for us
has he confessed to his magic ?
they recalled the sicilian disasters , the whole burden of his pride which they had borne for so long !
she took exorbitant taxes from them ; and executions with sword , axe , or cross were the punishment for delays and even complaint
as they came to tunis , some noticed that a troop of balearic slingers was missing
nothing to be frightened at , phoebus said casually , it ’ s trifling
the sun rose up from beneath the waves
the streets were soon astir , and everywhere soldiers began arming themselves in the midst of weeping women who flung themselves against their chests ; then they ran quickly to khamon ’ s square to fall in to ranks
but claude was no uninvolved listener )
it was an emaciated arm coming out of the window slit in the wall and holding her in a grip of iron
their hands were hacked away by cutlasses , and they fell backwards on to outstretched swords
now no one could see him ; he no longer had anything to look out for ; so he felt relief
i see that you are of monsieur de boucicaut ’ s opinion
she twisted about , heaved convulsively several times in agony and despair , but the other held her with extraordinary strength
you see , we know our greek
then quasimodo saw distinctly milling about in the parvis a frightening flock of ragged men and women armed with scythes , pikes , billhooks , and partisans , their hundreds of points all sparkling
la gaultière added , clasping her hands
indeed the tribes were providing them with ample supplies of food , and they did not themselves suspect how much their inactivity frightened the punic army
i should like to lose myself in the mists of the nights , in the water of the springs , in the sap of the trees , come out of my body , be no more than a breath , a ray , and glide , climb up to you , oh mother !
but a considerable crowd was massed all round it
this stroke of genius filled the soldiers with enthusiasm
but out of men who had set out for furthest ethiopia with excellent camels , new wineskins , and a stock of printed cloth , only one had come back to carthage – the others having died of exhaustion or gone mad from terror in the desert – and he reported seeing , well beyond black-harousch , after the atarantes and the land of great apes , vast kingdoms where the least utensils are all gold , and a river the colour of milk , broad as a sea ; forests of blue trees , spice hills , monsters with human faces , basking on rocks with eyes that spread out like flowers to look at you ; then , behind lakes covered with dragons , crystal mountains supporting the sun
she bore the same resemblance to what she had been as a virgin by masaccio to a virgin by raphael : frailer , thinner , more gaunt
you are like the château of dampmartin falling apart with laughter
through a cracked pane of glass he saw a sordid room , which awoke a confused memory in his mind
the blade went in very deep
now perhaps you understand ?
behind the cells there must be a shorter way out
the numidian king was dependent on her ; he was waiting impatiently for the wedding , and as this was to follow the victory , salammbo sent him this present to stimulate his courage
you could see between the trees the kitchen slaves running about , alarmed and half naked ; the gazelles grazing on the lawns ran away bleating ; as the sun set , the scent of the lemon trees only intensified the smell of this sweaty throng
so , cried the student , looking alternately at his brother and the alembics on the furnace , so everything here is askew , the ideas as well as the bottles
but hanno was unwilling to leave while a single screw was missing from the engines of war
no doubt la esmeralda could not think of the captain without bitterness
he would have liked to possess the veil , while abstaining from sacrilege
and if you saw the inside of the chapel !
and swore by saint george
you are to keep him with you , do you hear ?
to onlookers watching from their windows the place du palais , blocked with people , presented the appearance of a vast sea into which a dozen streets , like so many river mouths , continually disgorged fresh streams of heads
as soon as they saw the barbarians , they showed themselves
he remembered stumbling as he had come in against a bundle lying across the doorway outside
finally he went up on to the stone disc
elsewhere naked swords clashed so rapidly that only the points could be seen , and cavalry sweeps enlarged circles which closed behind them in a swirl
architecture , however , took great pains to conceal its nakedness
then , foaming at the mouth , wild-eyed , on all fours like a panther , bristling all over , she addressed tristan : come a bit nearer to take my daughter !
imagine what it ’ s like , a child playing , a child feeding at the breast , a child sleeping
the victims of the flogging had collapsed , but were held up by the bonds on their arms , and their heads lolled with closed eyes on their shoulders
she went on , clasping her lovely , wasted hands , and her chains could be heard rattling against her dress
the gold écu turned into a dry leaf
on the first , at the prow , they recognized gisco
said the captain , and unsheathed his rapier with a smile
it was that of the bald man who never took his eyes off the gypsy girl
most of the time it was some brief latin or greek motto , such as the middle ages were so good at formulating : unde ?
at news of the disaster carthage had almost shaken with anger and hatred ; the suffete would have been less execrated if he had allowed himself to be beaten from the start
narr ’ havas ’ s defection was assured ; the two sieges began again
not yet , said spendius , stopping him
yes , he told himself , she may be asleep , or praying
retorted the recluse , you must have been born
what do you take us for , gervaise ?
lads , the duke of egypt was telling his audience in falsetto tones , the witches in france go to their sabbath without a broomstick , without any grease , without anything to ride on , just with a few magic words
the ceiling was a network of beams , bearing in the middle of their gilding amethysts and topazes in the knots of the wood
it would have been a touching spectacle anywhere , this beautiful girl , fresh , pure , charming and at the same time so weak , coming thus piously to the help of so much misery , deformity , and malice
said tristan with his inquisitorial look
the unhappy deaf man went round it slowly , lifted up the bed and looked underneath , as if she might be hidden between the floor and the mattress , then shook his head and stayed bemused
the other statues , of monsters and demons , showed no hatred for quasimodo
he was not one of those swashbuckling military braggarts who take girls by storm
thus they ordered that someone should go and fetch them
there , absorbed more than ever in his beloved books , which he only left to hurry for an hour to the fief of the mill , this blend of learning and austerity , so rare at his age , had soon won him the respect and admiration of the cloister
let ’ s not cry over such a little thing , my lovely !
the lamentable voice issuing from the cage had chilled all those present , even maître olivier himself
and for the refreshment of passers-by , continued gisquette , the fountain had three spouts pouring out wine , milk , and hippocras , for anyone to help themselves
the slate-grey waves splashed gently , and the light breeze , driving their foam here and there , sprinkled them with white gashes
she sang all this in an old canaanite dialect which the barbarians did not understand
they never stopped their mocking , ironic , humiliating comments
yes , said the provincial lady , at reims
in order to retain within the city the spirit of the gods their images were covered with chains
besides i was avenging myself as i waited !
she ’ ll take your doublet , you ’ ll take her skirt
the mother offered no resistance , she just dragged herself over to her daughter and threw herself headlong over her
what do i care ?
although they had died almost at the same time , there were differences in their degree of corruption
the other was an earthenware pot , crude and common , but it had kept all its water , and the flowers in it had stayed fresh and bright red
but the principal masses discernible to the eye , once it began to adjust to this jumble of buildings , are as follows
we have our pope of fools in ghent too , and we don ’ t lag behind anyone when it comes to that , by the rood !
after so much hardship they gave you a collar of honour , like the tinkling bells they put round donkeys ’ chests to bemuse them as they walk and stop them feeling tired
the monotonous rocking of the boat and the lapping of the water had somehow numbed the unhappy claude
they talked to each other in low voices
she had recognized the sound of the golden bells worn by schahabarim on the bottom of his robe
there were also a goodly number of abbeys whose beauty was more religious and grandeur more solemn than the mansions , but no less beautiful nor less grand for that
he was the one who stole the zaïmph !
there was talk of moving on carthage en masse and of calling in the romans
he felt himself tied at hands and knees , and fell
she cried , clasping her lovely hands sorrowfully
she was a real darling !
a hail of stones drove him back ; for the suffete had captured the catapults they had abandoned at the bridge
they waited two more days ; then on the morning of the third they took their decision
but he was soon obliged to string out his regiments in a column in order to climb the mountain separating the two valleys
that done , the king of tunis turned round and ran his eyes over his army , a ferocious multitude whose eyes gleamed almost as brightly as their pikes
he had a vague feeling that he would look ridiculous
cut them down , tristan !
she ground her teeth
they did not even know where hamilcar was
some of them came forward like women , with obscene gestures ; others tripped naked to fight among the cups like gladiators , and a company of greeks danced round a vase decorated with nymphs , while a negro banged an ox-bone on a bronze shield
when this kind of cyclops appeared at the entrance to the chapel , motionless , squat , and almost as broad as he was tall , squared by the base ’ as a great man put it , his surcoat , half red , half violet , sprinkled with silver bells , and above all his quite perfect ugliness , at once enabled the people to recognize him , and they cried with one voice :
the barbarians did not stop : they went further on to find a narrower place
mind you don ’ t , maître jacques !
the libyans and the nomads composing autharitus ’ army hardly knew these mercenaries , men of italian or greek race ; and since the republic was offering them so many barbarians for so few carthaginians , it must be because the former were worthless and the others very valuable
all this had left claude saddened and disheartened in his human affections , and he had thrown himself all the more enthusiastically into the arms of science , that sister who does at least not laugh in your face and always repays you , although sometimes in rather shortweight coin , for your attentions to her
he listened with open mouth , and the bronze plates round his ribs rose as his heart leaped
her eyes burn me , i hear her voice
he saw her angry gesture , and understood her reproach
then a fruitful idea occurred to him
fines , lost property , taxes , expenses , reasonable costs , wages , damages and interests , torture , prison , gaol , stocks with costs , are so much christmas pie and midsummer marzipan for him !
i am indeed , to be sure , he said
i suspected as much , said the soldier
this time she could only nod her head
what do you say to such philosophy ?
first it was the young vicomte de cormontreuil , whose church tower is three-quarters of a league from reims ; then messire henri de triancourt , the king ’ s master of horse ; then , going down , chiart de beaulion , sergeant-at-arms ; then , still going down , guery aubergeon , the king ’ s carver ; then macé de frépus , monsieur le dauphin ’ s barber ; then thévenin le moine , the king ’ s cook ; then , going down all the time , less and less young , less and less noble , she fell as low as guillaume racine , fiddler , and thierry de mer , lamplighter
the palliasse remained master of the battlefield
the recluse went pale
the young student hurried in great alarm to the paternal home
by the ergastulum , under a palm tree , someone was crying in a voice of lamentation and supplication , murmuring : master , oh , master !
it was obvious that the bell-ringer had to serve the archdeacon for a given time , at the end of which he would carry off his soul by way of payment
it seemed to me that the marble floor slabs had risen up to my knees
he said to himself , i haven ’ t a sou
within the precincts of notre-dame , the condemned girl was in fact inviolable
we had some merry moments
everything around him is as smiling , beaming , radiant as himself , down to the breath of wind and the ray of sunlight frolicking in rivalry through his downy curls
however , he gathered up all the strength remaining to him for one last effort
( i am not sure , be it said in passing , that it is not the same into which you can still look today through a little square window , open to the east at a man ’ s height , on the platform from which the towers spring : a squalid chamber , at present bare , empty and dilapidated , the peeling plaster of the walls decorated here and there at the moment with a few sorry engravings of cathedral façades
but the basket was empty ; salammbo was upset
the children ’ s shouts reminded him that he had not had any supper either
what i saw was being seen by others as well , and yet it was not a sight intended for human eyes
mâtho however was watching spendius , who sat on a pile of sheepskins listening , nodding agreement
the luckless woman realized that everything depended on putting on a bold face , and with death in her heart she began to snigger
with the zaïmph enfolding him he looked like a star god surrounded by the firmament
the slave put on his costume again , and they left the house and the harbour together
he began by praising the gods and the republic ; the barbarians should be proud to have served it
the citizen whose window it was opened it , appeared in his nightshirt with his lamp , looked at the quay bemusedly , said a few words she could not catch , and closed his shutter again
he ordered shorter swords , stouter boots
he said in a low voice , with a finger to his lips
he stumbled several times , for the ground had levels of uneven height , forming in the room , as it were , a succession of apartments
the provincial woman held a stout lad by the hand , and he in turn held a large cake
they were no doubt being driven by hunger ; and maddened by hardships , despite their weakness , were coming to give battle
o rabbetna , baalet , tanit !
but spendius , who was listening out intently , quickly snatched up the zaïmph , threw it in a corner , and piled sheepskins on top of it there was a murmur of voices , torches shone , and narr ’ havas came in , followed by about a score of men
sometimes it suddenly broke up , extending its black swirls into the distance ; an eagle had plunged into their midst , then flew off again ; on the terraces , the domes , the tip of the obelisks and the pediment of the temples , sat , here and there , great birds clutching shreds of human flesh in their bloody beaks
the light from the candelabra deepened the colour of her cheeks , the gold of her clothes and the whiteness of her skin ; round her waist , on her arms , her hands and toes she wore such a mass of jewellery that the mirror , like a sun , reflected the rays at her ; and salammbo , standing beside taanach , leaning forward to see her , smiled at such a dazzling effect
there he did not move again
he had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded
the inside of the hovel was no less decrepit than she was
when he came to , phoebus and la esmeralda were alone , sitting on the wooden chest beside the lamp , which lit up sharply before the archdeacon ’ s eyes these two youthful figures and a wretched pallet at the far end of the garret
from time to time some shrill vibrant voice would pierce the general hubbub …
one day , as he was walking gloomily past the tour criminelle , he noticed quite a crowd at one of the doors of the palais de justice
quasimodo watched him fall
that leather bed , on which so many poor wretches had writhed , appalled her
i ’ ll have you thrashed with a full peal of rods on your back through all the crossroads of paris
twelve , replied the libyan
considering here only european , christian architecture , younger sister of the great masonries of the orient , it strikes the eye as a huge formation divided into three clearly distinct zones superimposed one upon the other : the romanesque zone , number the gothic , the renaissance , which we should like to call graeco-roman
it occurred to him to summon the captains ; then his heralds cried this order in greek–a language which , since xanthippus ’ time , had been used for commands in the carthaginian forces
monsieur le président , replied the advocate , since the defendant has confessed her crime , i have only one word to say to these gentlemen
once he looked beneath him , into the abyss ; when he raised his head again his eyes were closed and his hair standing on end
when he finally promised to kill mâtho himself , she cried :
then they found themselves in the open air again , in a transversal corridor , where a minute altar was leaning against an ivory door
to having had habitual dealings with the devil in the form of a familiar she-goat , jointly charged with you ?
yet being on duty with the beautiful fleur-de-lys was pleasant and delightful , and so it had formerly appeared to him ; but the captain had become gradually bored with it ; the prospect of a forthcoming marriage cooled his ardour more every day
finally louis xv style , with its chicory and vermicelli , and all the warts and all the tumours disfiguring that old architecture , a toothless , decaying , and still coquettish hag
hosier , at the sign of the three little chains at ghent
it makes it even better that in the chapel of saints ferreol and ferrution there are two statues , one of saint john the baptist and the other of saint antony , of solid gold , weighing altogether number gold marcs number esterlins , and the silver-gilt pedestals number marcs number ounces
mâtho profited by this to continue wreaking havoc among the numidians
i only need one sol parisis , and i need it for seven o ’ clock
aut unum bombum [ or a fart ]
at her death , at the moment of passing over to another tomb , she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to women in affliction , mothers , widows , or daughters , who had much praying to do for others or for themselves , and wished to be buried alive in great grief or great penitence
that very morning he had left hippo-zarytus with his soldiers to march on carthage
oh , if only you knew , how in the midst of war i think of you !
just one of them could destroy us !
what ’ s wrong with me ?
i could not say
she cried , feeling cornered , and in a tearful voice despite herself , i swear to you , my lord , that it was a cart that broke those bars
it is a collection of examples from several centuries , and the finest have disappeared
flamel considers that it is easier to work on terrestrial fire
but what could be done just with the sacred legion , , strong at most ?
the stones must tremble under her sandals and the stars lean down to see her !
the hydra of the romanceros bristles further on , with other hybrid forms , the vedas and the nibelungen
while they were drinking , faces plunged into the pitchers , sixty carthaginians leaped upon them , and stabbed them to death with daggers , in the back
what do you have that makes you so attached to life ?
fleur-de-lys said sharply to the captain
it was at that moment that from the back of the square a man in a white robe came forward
at the end of the fifteenth century the formidable gibbet , which dated from number , was already very dilapidated
i have long dreamed of an officer saving my life
at length , shaking his heavy , misshapen head , he said : it ’ s my misfortune still to look too much like a man
behind her on each side stood two long lines of pallid men , wearing white robes with red fringes falling right down to their feet
some managed to discover chameleons or snakes
for four days we have greatly suffered from the sun
she saw , however , at the window a face looking at her
the tribe of egypt is very fond of her…
they tried to clamber up to reach the top ; the bulging shape of these great masses prevented any foothold
the keep at etampes is an example
when they tried to remove it from the skeleton it embraced , it fell to dust
then , under the gateway , he turned towards the mercenaries and cried out that they would be sorry
what men arrange , said claude , things disarrange
tree trunks , held by cables , pounded up and down on the rams ; grapples , thrown by the balistae , tore off the roof of the huts ; and from the platform of the towers streams of flints and pebbles rained down
he showed the unrolled papyrus : look at it then !
great cries , neighing , clash of armour rose into the air , and fanfares of trumpets sounded the charge
some who had knives fell upon others
for he was so crushed by the gods ’ injustice that he had no strength left for being indignant with men
i seem to be about to hear her voice , see her face , i am dazzled by flashes of light
he was really lost this time : the multitude clapped its hands
but it keeps its leaves in winter
abdalonim fell backwards to the ground in a faint
the latter had a more complex mechanism ; on a small column , a crossbar was fixed by its centre , to which a kind of channel came in at right angles ; at the ends of the crossbar rose two pillars containing a contraption of twisted horse-hair ; two beams were fastened to them holding up the ends of a rope which led down to the bottom of the channel on to a bronze plate
but there was i taking that for hatred !
the sound of songs blended with the death-rattle of the slaves dying amid the broken cups
… so a single wretched thought , the priest went on , is enough to make a man feeble and mad !
no doubt was possible ; the child could not write
lamenting voices rose from afar , in the darkness , and like a chorus of genii incited her
they did not have enough room ; they were pushed together half rearing up , clashing their tusks against each other
you were able to see her : tell me about her !
he let himself be led off to the goddess ’ s servants : but he came back down the hill sobbing , like someone returning from a funeral
hide me in some corner where i can see whether this woman really is the one whose name you mentioned
no sooner had the toys been spread out on the matting than the child was surprised to see the goat , one of whose miracles ’ this no doubt was , pull out certain letters with its gilded hoof , and gently push them so as to arrange them in a certain order
then they advanced as far as the barbarians ’ front lines and , taking them in the flank , slaughtered them wholesale
it must be said that a permanent gallows and pillory , a justice ’ and a ladder ’ as they were then called , standing side by side in the middle of the paving , contributed not a little to making people avert their gaze from this fatal site , where so many beings full of life and health had breathed their last ; where fifty years later was to be born that saint-vallier ’ s fever , that sickness which is a terror of the scaffold , the most monstrous of all sicknesses , because it comes not from god but from man
at first he thought he was suffocating
what ’ s become of her ?
the creature i had before my eyes had that more than human beauty which can come only from heaven or hell
when the fourteenth child was brought up everyone could see him make a great gesture of horror
you will continue with your tisane , and we shall answer for your majesty
it would be better to take them to carthage !
meanwhile the bells , now forgotten , suddenly all fell silent at the same time , to the great disappointment of the lovers of bell-ringing , who were listening to the peal in all good faith from the pont-au-change , and went away as bewildered as a dog who has been shown a bone and given a stone
at that he fell back , and salammbo was astonished at his consternation : for she was not thinking of carthage but of the sacrilege in which she had some complicity
well , the archdeacon went on after a fresh silence , which maître jacques took care not to disturb , are you having any success ?
the girl had recognized the spiteful recluse
what we call police ’ today did not then exist
after a few minutes quasimodo looked round the crowd despairingly , and repeated in a still more heart-rending voice : drink !
the man went on , with a coarse laugh even more bestial than the provost ’ s , we shan ’ t have far to go
the barbarians paid no heed ; they went on listening to the maiden ’ s song
there was no lethal invention unrepresented , from wooden daggers , stone axes , and ivory tridents , to long swords serrated like saws , with thinner blades of flexible copper
a very pleasant existence , all things considered , he said , and very conducive to musing
you can laugh afterwards
when that was done , now calmer , she knelt down and prayed
may it please the court to condemn my client to that fine
first he had prevented the siege of carthage and massacre of the captives ; then he had not profited from the victory over hanno after the defeat of utica
they broke down the doors
the chimaeras had lost their wings , the pataeci gods their arms , the bulls their silver horns – and all of them with peeling paint , inert , rotten , but full of history and still giving off the tang of voyages , like wounded soldiers seeing their masters again , seemed to say to him : here we are !
an infinite dread oppressed every breast
his companion made no reply
those are the maîtres des requêtes of the king ’ s household
the wicket where the bulls of the anti-pope benedict were torn up , and from whence those who had brought them set out again , mockingly decked in cope and mitre , to make amende honorable right through paris ?
i see your eyes in the flames of the fire-arrows and the gilding on the shields !
to pass through a low door you must needs stoop
the hosier boldly answered : if this revolt is what i assume , you would want in vain , sire
he was becoming more and more engrossed in this melancholy reverie when a song , strange but sweet , suddenly tore him out of it
strips of cloth , as on a mummy , were wound round his legs , and the flesh bulged out between the crossed material
i used once to be just a soldier lost in the mass of the mercenaries , and so easy-going that i used to carry wood on my back for the others
but he was too dizzy and too bruised
complaints and grievances against our garrisons in picardy !
he casts spells on us down the chimney
each one has to bear his misfortune !
meanwhile , after some minutes of triumph , quasimodo had abruptly plunged into the church with his burden
he looked at him , and felt moved by a kind of pity
he woke her before daybreak
the goat had been trained to do this by the gypsy , who had such a rare gift for these delicate tasks that two months had sufficed for her to teach the goat to write the word phoebus with movable letters
she found it with its tail rolled round one of the silver balustrades , by the hanging bed , rubbing against it to get rid of its old , yellowing skin , while its bright , glistening body stretched out like a sword half out of its sheath
you ’ re lying , old woman !
but a bar of light rose up in the east
the girls whispered , dumbfounded ; that ’ s the captain ’ s name !
thus what it felt at that moment was absolutely vague , indistinct , and confused
he stayed in front ; and his horse , covered in yellow spots like a dragon , and throwing up spray all round him , went on through the mud with violent effort
nameless terror froze the barbarians
i don ’ t want to hurt you
for the rest , this all went with great pretensions to elegance , fine clothes , and handsome demeanour
for the rest there was no fire in the furnace , and indeed it looked as though none had been lit for a long time
and as though wearied by so much talk , she let her head drop back on her knees
so you ’ ll be able to get in
when the first preparations were complete , and it must be said to the honour of truand discipline that clopin ’ s orders were carried out in silence and with admirable precision , the worthy leader of the band climbed on to the parapet of the parvis and raised his gruff , raucous voice , standing turned towards notre-dame and waving his torch , the light from which , blown about by the wind and continually obscured by its own smoke , made the reddish façade of the church alternately appear and disappear from sight
as protection against elephants , mâtho set up a corps of cataphract horsemen , in which man and horse were covered in nail-studded armour of hippopotamus hide ; and to protect the horses ’ hooves they had shoes of woven rushes
there was a pretence of not understanding them
all i have loved !
their community of existence had established deep friendships among these men
pasque-dieu ! —i warn you that i ’ ve just been seeing king louis xi and it ’ s from him that i ’ ve caught that oath—pasque-dieu !
the nightmare image of quasimodo grinding his teeth was itself enough to bar entry
hey there , mahiet baliffre , is that where they ’ re going to hang her ?
when the philosopher felt the boat moving , he clapped his hands and kissed djali between her horns
she said , can the sorceresses have changed my daughter into this dreadful animal ?
gringoire rushed into it , hoping that his fleetness of foot would enable him to escape from the three infirm spectres clinging on to him
soon the provisions diminished
and if i am short of men , i will draw the bears down from the mountains and drive on the lions !
then they rushed with their cutlasses and spears , and beat at the gates
snuff out the children and the candles
now all they felt for their divinities was hatred and , in revenge , they tried to stop believing in them
wanting isn ’ t everything , said clopin gruffly
they were talking together in whispers , with stifled laughter , like any collection of girls with a young man in their midst
there ’ s one can ’ t get his ears through !
good-day , madame , said the boy gravely
i rose , i fled , but , alas !
do you take my horse for a gallows ?
the night was very dark
he was beginning to take himself seriously as a character in a fairy tale ; from time to time he looked around as if to see whether the fiery chariot hitched to two winged chimeras , for nothing else could have conveyed him so swiftly from hell to paradise , was still there
the chimneys of the houses , the crenellations of the walls , the carved roof-gables , the spire of the augustins , the tour de nesle , all these projections indenting the profile of the colossal obelisk , added to the optical illusion with their weird simulation of the jagged carvings of some fantastic , luxuriant sculpture
dom claude interrupted him : you are happy then ?
the priest whom the girls had noticed on top of the north tower , leaning out over the square and so intently watching the gypsy ’ s dance , was indeed archdeacon claude frollo
just as quasimodo was exhausting himself in conjectures , he seemed to see the movement reappear in the rue du parvis , which runs into the cité at right angles to the front of notre-dame
indeed the rabbetna , now bereft of her veil , was as though deprived of part of her virtue
i will not help you in this odious crime
what , baptiste croque-oison , with your fine nose , are you going to risk it against that lout ’ s great fists !
the empire of galilee was hardly more advanced ; one could just make out in its music some wretched rebec from the infancy of the musical art , still confined to re-la-mi but it was around the pope of fools that all the musical riches of the period were displayed in magnificent cacophony
drops of boiling oil were thrown at him with tubes ; shards of glass were sprinkled under his feet ; he went on walking
at the quieter hours , suddenly masses of people would rush along shouting ; and from the top of the acropolis fires looked like crimson rags laid out over the terraces , twisting in the wind
the whole horizon was coloured red as blood
all , as they saw him go , were convinced that he would not come back
this sight abruptly changed his train of thought , and congealed the flow of his musical enthusiasm as a puff of wind congeals molten resin
everything overflowed with brine , truffles , and assa foetida
the unfortunate girl , just as she was going back into the fateful tumbril on her way to her final destination , was seized , perhaps , by some anguished longing for life
the building maintained its calm , deserted air , but something froze the truands ’ courage
to demonstrate his vigilance the chief of perfumes offered the suffete an amber spoon containing a little malobathrum to taste ; then pierced three indian bezoars with an awl
hamilcar ’ s daughter is pursuing me !
he went about always surrounded by a little court of bishops and abbots of noble lineage , gallant , bawdy , and good trenchermen if need be ; and more than once the pious ladies of saint-germain d ’ auxerre , passing in the evening beneath the brightly lit windows of the bourbon residence , had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had sung them vespers in the daytime chanting to the clink of glasses the bacchic motto of benedict xii , the pope who added a third crown to the tiara : bibamus papaliter ’ [ let us drink papally ]
she cried in a rage
the war against carthage was his personal affair ; he was angry that others should become involved in it and be unwilling to obey him
it was quite an adventure
at that time anyone who was born a poet became an architect
when he had finished , dom claude took him by the hand and said to him coldly : all right
spendius , narr ’ havas , and mâtho sent off men to all the tribes on punic territory
it upsets my throat
if you only knew how much i love you !
meanwhile supplies , despite hamilcar ’ s care , dwindled terribly
and what defies explanation is that the blinder the passion , the more tenacious it is
besides , that is easier than one might think
at that despair was so intense that many people , especially women , flung themselves down , headfirst , from the top of the acropolis
and in his thirst for knowledge he had successively devoured one set of decretals after another , those of theodore [ sc
then he began promptly to read them , one after the other , made a sign to maître olivier ’ , who appeared to be acting as his minister , to take up a pen , and without informing him of the contents of the dispatches , began in a low voice to dictate answers to them , which olivier wrote down , kneeling somewhat uncomfortably in front of the table
indignant as he was at the frauds committed against him , when he noticed bundles of nard being wrapped up for countries overseas , he ordered antimony to be mixed with it to make it heavier
hanno had finished his preparations
give it here , by god , or i ’ ll search you , be you as leprous as job or scabby as caesar !
wasn ’ t she your wife ?
a large dog , solemnly sitting in the ashes , was turning a spit laden with meat before the glowing embers
she called for schahabarim and when he came no longer had anything to say to him
she understood nothing about this strange friend whom chance had given her
the furious beasts galloped through the syntagmata
i am borne away by some impulse !
it must contain a lot of nitre and sal volatile
that ’ s what you ’ ve done
thus moloch possessed carthage ; he embraced the ramparts , he rolled through the streets , he devoured even the corpses
the priest stared hard at her , with a smile that she had never seen before
i want to know all i have lost , to the last shekel , to the last cab !
jacques coictier bowed deeply and said : sire , what will save you is a repercussive
she made a sign to show that she was listening
at the coronation , that same year , number , it was she who made the king of the ribalds ’ bed !
thin chains went up from his fingers to his shoulders and came down behind , where men , pulling on them , brought up level with his elbows his two open hands which , as they came nearer , met against his belly ; they moved several times in succession , in little jerky movements
silence all round , and attend to the chorus :
my companions and yours !
it was indeed the second accused
what does that matter to us ?
maître jacques , he cried , let fate do its work !
more than a score of times already the massive door which they were assaulting so furiously had shaken beneath the weight of their oaken battering ram multiplied by the strength of a hundred men
what punishment can you fear from the gods since you will have their strength in your hands ?
he had preferred to be rebuked by her rather than distress her
then they went back northwards , aimlessly , without even knowing the roads
the clerk at once began drafting the sentence
we should stroll along covered in purple like satraps
it was none too soon
such impassivity exasperated him ; he cried :
where have you got to in gratian ’ s decretals ?
on his head he wore a kind of circular headgear , closed on top ; but it was hard to tell whether it was a child ’ s padded bonnet or a king ’ s crown , the two are so much alike
women all love that
the philosopher ’ s forecast , as he sees human thought , volatilized by the printing press , evaporate out of its theological container
no admiration could be too great for a monument which might equally well be a king ’ s palace , a house of commons , a town hall , a college , a riding school , an academy , a warehouse , a lawcourt , a museum , a barracks , a sepulchre , a temple , a theatre
for the second time they were retreating before him
she was unable even to utter a cry
exclaimed the duke of egypt
narr ’ havas , who roved about between the three armies , was just then near him
the sound of glasses , feasting , swearing , and quarrelling could be heard through the broken window panes
all this clamour attracted the cardinal ’ s attention
godmother , cried bérangère , whose constantly roving eyes had suddenly looked up at the top of the towers of notre-dame , who ’ s that man in black up there ?
one might well still have now and then , under the reign of the printing press , a column made , i suppose , by a whole army out of cannon all stuck together as , under the reign of architecture , one had iliads and romanceros , mahabharatas and nibelungen , made by a whole people from an accumulation and fusion of rhapsodies
narr ’ havas had surrounded them with his cavalry ; the suffete meanwhile was driving them back , crushing them ; and then they were beaten in advance through the loss of the zaïmph ; even those who did not care for it had felt some anxiety and a sort of enfeeblement
when claude and quasimodo went out together , which frequently occurred , and were seen in each other ’ s company , the servant behind his master , passing through the cool , narrow , dark streets adjoining notre-dame , more than one spiteful remark , more than one ironic snatch of song , more than one rude gibe pestered them as they went by , unless , as rarely happened , claude frollo walked with head erect , showing his severe and almost august forehead to silence the mockers
the first member of the audience whom messire miles d ’ isliers , doctor of decretals , saw arriving every monday morning , quite out of breath , when the doors opened at the school of chef-saint-denis , was claude frollo
the surging crowd of soldiers jostled each other
meanwhile salammbo continued on her way
in the front row , bending most closely over the bed , could be seen four women who , from their grey cowls , a sort of cassock , presumably belonged to some religious sisterhood
do i get my roof ?
sang the legless man
her lips trembled , her chest heaved
the negroes demanded white shells such as were used for trade in the african interior
exclaimed the gypsy with an expression of kindly pity
hence there were hundreds of contradictory forms of policing , that is to say none at all
for pity ’ s sake have we really drunk away all the reverend ’ s wallet ?
for himself , he resolved to go back to carthage to collect soldiers there and start the war again
their companion was got up in much the same way , but there was something about her dress and bearing which had a whiff of the country lawyer ’ s wife
all to no effect
then she shook herself , and cried out in a loud , heart-rending voice : no !
the duke of egypt at the head , on horseback , with his counts on foot , holding his bridle and stirrups ; behind them the egyptian men and women in no particular order , with their small children yelling on their shoulders ; all of them , the duke , counts , ordinary people , in rags and tinsel
at that moment he saw the people draw aside
said the mother , there are so many sorcerers about nowadays that i think they burn them without knowing their names , you might as well try to know the name of every cloud in the sky
the high , pointed shields , stuck side by side into the turf , protected the infantry
the traders at their shop doors , the workmen who went by holding a lead ruler , the brine sellers rinsing out their baskets , the clients in the baths , the hot-drink sellers , all discussed the operations of the campaign
then he replied : no !
the barbarians were weakening ; some greek hoplites threw away their arms , the others were seized with panic spendius could be seen leaning over on his dromedary , goading it with two spears in the shoulders
they surrounded hamilcar , they congratulated him ; it was like brothers meeting their brother again
whatever you will , she answered feebly , but kill me quickly
yes , knowledge meant everything to me
a wet footprint showed beyond
they ought to be attacked at once with fresh troops
passers-by going about their business did not look in through this turbulent window
that night , then , quasimodo , after glancing at his poor neglected bells , jacqueline , marie , thibault , had gone right up to the top of the north tower , and there , putting down on the leads his firmly closed dark lantern , had begun looking out over paris
but pierre l ’ assommeur [ the slaughterman ] has been slaughtered !
cried the greek , leaping up ; he strode along ; his eyes glinted and a strange smile creased his jackal face
then the lances looked like tall blades of grass , finally everything disappeared into a trail of dust ; those soldiers who turned round towards carthage could now only see the long walls , silhouetted against the horizon with their empty battlements
she repeated several times : go away !
well , burned it then ?
she has just disappeared
they were dragging it with both hands , hauling with ropes and pushing with their shoulders – for the slope rising inland from the plain , although extremely gentle , was often impracticable for machines of such prodigious weight
it was one of those spring days so sweet and lovely that all paris fills the squares and promenades to celebrate as if it were a sunday
it ’ s a woman , monsieur
a student , robin poussepain , i think , went up to laugh in his face , but came too near
have you made gold ?
the sachette knows me slightly
the light hurt so badly that she closed her eyes
i ’ m afraid of the gypsy girl seeing me
help , gentlemen of the watch !
gudule made an effort and said : above all that one
in fact , hamilcar had secretly sent back to the quirites the crews of the latin vessels captured before the defection of the tyrian towns ; and rome , as an exchange of courtesies , now sent back its captives
spendius repeated the same things to the gauls , the greeks , the campanians , the balearics
it was a poor , awkward , clumsy organism standing with bowed head and pleading eye before an intellect at once lofty and profound , powerful and superior
the gypsy was paying no heed to him
trouillefou made a sign , and the duke , the emperor , the archisuppôts , and the cagoux formed a horseshoe round him , with gringoire , still held bodily in rough hands , at the centre
nothing is going to make us die , for i haven ’ t died of joy !
he cried , clapping his hands , there ’ s a red glow in the sky over the cité
she asked the gypsy
[ noble sir , to buy a crust of bread !
under that thin canvas sack , in january , lying naked on a granite floor , without a fire , in the shadows of a dungeon whose slanting window let in from outside only the icy wind and never the sun , she did not seem to be suffering , or even to feel
then his fears came back
utica had already asked several times for help from carthage
said the provost , how greedy she is for the rack !
narr ’ havas had stopped talking ; salammbo , without answering , looked at him
renewed fury drove on the barbarians
an extension of his strength , an indefinite continuation of his person was partly revealed to him , and the slaves did not understand what had pacified him
the blind man ran
at his thundering voice the ranks of men closed up : even the lame stepped up their pace ; in the middle of the isthmus the gap narrowed
when he learned the news , he shut himself up in his cell in the cloister
at last the houses leaped over philip-augustus ’ s wall , and joyfully scattered over the plain in ragged disorder , as though escaping from captivity
you are quite right to want me one day to become a graduate and sub-monitor of the collège de torchi
the little trochilus bird makes its nest in the crocodile ’ s mouth
jumping over the ravines and bushes , they drove the fugitives like hounds hunting hares
voices call me , a ball of fire rolls and comes up into my breast , it stifles me , i am about to die ; and then something sweet , flowing from my brow down to my feet , passes over my flesh… it is a caress that enfolds me , and i feel crushed as though a god were stretched out on me
but perhaps you know of some stronger gods or some irresistible invocation ?
while the pensionary of ghent and his eminence were exchanging low bows and a few words in an even lower voice , a tall man with a broad face and powerful shoulders came up so that he entered abreast with guillaume rym , looking like a mastiff beside a fox
and when they are in your city , poor and numerous among all your wealth , it does not occur to you to weaken them by the slightest division !
he announced that , gaulish mercenaries were coming , and that the king of macedonia was sending soldiers
say something to her
she was outside society , outside life , but she vaguely felt that it might not be impossible to come inside again
as he felt the king ’ s pulse , coictier looked more and more alarmed
none of the mercenaries knew the mountains , and marching at the head of the columns they had led on the others
a great hubbub arose below
instead of the confusion they had imagined , they found everywhere a frightening order and silence
the poor bell-ringer ’ s eyes filled with tears , but not one did he let fall
meanwhile , when the sun of the middle ages had finally set , when gothic genius had faded away for ever on the horizon of art , architecture became ever more dull , colourless , nondescript
i ’ m not asking anything from anyone , but i want my child !
it is certain that he had often been seen going along the rue des lombards and furtively entering a small house at the corner of the rue des écrivains and the rue marivault
there was continual movement within it from head to tail ; for those who were at the end of the ranks ran up to the front , and the latter , from weariness or because of the wounded , fell back
saying which he pointed his finger at the little bearded hungarian , who had accosted gringoire with his facitote caritatem ’ and who , knowing no other language , observed with surprise the bad temper of the king of tunis venting itself on him
the student hardly noticed ,
nor have i—if only you knew that she ’ s all i ’ ve got , that i am old , that she ’ s a blessing sent to me by the holy virgin
the unclean-eaters at once found arms there
by the devil ’ s mercy , joannes frollo replied ; more than four hours now , and i have every hope of having them counted against my time in purgatory
let her die , that lovely , sweet , adorable creature , needful for the light of the world , more divine than god ?
there was a feeling of successive ages and , as it were , memories of forgotten lands
the parks were battered , the streams dried up , the prison doors open
come and take it
you look like that golden sheep the duke of burgundy wears round his neck
that is when the republic will take its revenge !
mâtho had relapsed into his gloom : his legs hung down to the ground , and the grass continually rustled as it flicked against his boots
they admired it , they execrated it , they would have liked to destroy it and at the same time to live there
at that the carthaginians broke out with murmuring against the suffete ’ s partiality for the mercenaries
they are about to give a peremptory flogging to maître quasimodo , bell-ringer to my brother , monsieur the archdeacon of josas , a weird bit of oriental architecture , with a dome for a back , and twisted columns for legs !
in closing it had cut off the one ray of light and joy which still penetrated quasimodo ’ s soul
it was covered in green silk , and at its centre had a large , green , glass bead , in imitation of an emerald
in number quasimodo was about number , claude frollo about number ; the one had grown up , the other had aged
which i should like to translate thus : time is blind , man is stupid
we are your judges
no doubt the church of notre-dame de paris is still today a sublime and majestic building
take care , la falourdel , that he doesn ’ t bang on your door
he installed himself in the stern , and the girl , in whom the stranger inspired an indefinable anxiety , came to sit pressed closely against the poet
they came to the cypress avenue , where they were lost among the crowd , who plied them with questions
he did not know , but at any rate he was a phoebus , and that magical name was enough to make the archdeacon stealthily follow the two carefree friends , listening to what they said and watching their slightest gesture with anxious attention
the girl hurled herself upon him like a raging tigress , and thrust him on to the stairs with supernatural strength
irreligious and superstitious , like any soldier who is only a soldier , when he questioned himself about this adventure , he was not happy about the goat , about the odd way he had first met la esmeralda , about the equally strange manner in which she had revealed to him the secret of her love , finally about the bogey-monk
i ’ d like to know what use a mill is to a bishop !
all for you , enchantress—to be more worthy of your hell !
paris since louis xi has not grown by much more than a third
during her absence a neighbour had seen two gypsy women sneak up there with a bundle in their arms , then come down again , closing the door behind them , and run away
it meant that he always had a bed and some bread
there were two or three little windows in its walls , so densely latticed with thick iron bars that the glass could not be seen
we had women to sweep out our stables in drepanum
a very pure , white light brought out vividly to the eye all the different planes which the hundreds of houses present to the east
i am not afraid of her beauty any more !
at that moment hamilcar was standing on the roof of melkarth
at that moment olivier le daim came back
women have the most depraved tastes !
dressed pretty much as a savage , said diane de christeuil , showing off her beautiful teeth as she laughed
maître , said one of them , beckoning him closer …
he did not follow out his thought to the end , stopping at the limit where it terrified him
the royal carillon of the palais casts in all directions respendent trills , on to which fall at regular intervals the heavy strokes from the belfry of notre-dame , striking sparks from them like the anvil under the hammer
first they described their good treatment by the suffete ; the barbarians listened enviously , although they despised them
the crossroads were dark
they were the fish of the barca family
his face was austere , his forehead broad , his gaze piercing
to the greeks she spoke greek , then she turned to the ligurians , the campanians , the negroes ; and as each one heard her , this voice brought back the sweetness of his homeland
i can still save you !
schahabarim , without answering , continued to walk ; and crossing the whole enclosure step by step he arrived beneath the legs of the colossus , then touched it on each side with outstretched arms , a solemn formula of worship
but you are a terrible mistress ! … it is through you that monsters are produced , fearsome spectres , lying dreams ; your eyes eat up the stones of buildings , and monkeys are sick every time you are renewed
he had almost no direct perception of them
you can now judge the effect on him of the cardinal ’ s abrupt and untimely arrival
but hatred swept away all restraint
he saw , and they all saw , paces away , on top of a ridge , more barbarians !
what is peculiar , oudarde observed , is that the sachette has the same idea about gypsies
and for fear of a countermand he rushed to the door which tristan opened for him with somewhat bad grace
reading this dismal text his sensations were those of a blind man when he feels himself pricked by the stick he has just picked up
the captain , feeling more and more ill at ease , fell back on the tapestry : that really is a charming piece of work !
listen , exclaimed quasimodo , thinking he would overcome this hesitation with a word , come , my lord !
devil choke the proctor of the german nation !
in the twinkling of an eye the enclosed area of the parvis was empty
he had just done his last rounds in the church
when you were talking to me just now it was like music !
it was as though he were hearing the song through her eyes
the people whom he had joined were walking and jostling each other in silence
basically gringoire , like monsieur despréaux , was not a very passionate man ’
she looked at him gravely
but there was enough to do with thickening up the wall and making it as high as possible without bothering about them ; they were abandoned ; all of them perished ; and though they were generally hated , this caused great revulsion against hamilcar
the poor student ’ s death filled the crowd with burning fury
so he was taking the liberty of abducting you , as if you were made for beadles !
they parted before him
that day there was to be a bonfire on the place de grève , a maypole set up at the chapel of braque , and a mystery play at the palais de justice
it meant death for carthage , victory for the barbarians
farewell to any vigour , originality , life , intelligence
he distrusted the odd ways of women
i know very well why
but you must surely realize , went on kindly oudarde , that yesterday was a holiday
however the python had fallen sick again ; and as salammbo on the contrary seemed to be cured , old taanach rejoiced , convinced that as it wasted away it was taking on its mistress ’ s languor
and when you looked past the bridges , on which the roofs were plainly turning green , mouldering before their time in the vapours from the water , and turned your gaze to the left , towards the university , the first building to strike the eye was a large , low bunch of towers , the petit châtelet , whose yawning gateway swallowed up the end of the petit-pont
in the middle of this round table of beggary , clopin trouillefou , like the doge of this senate , like the king of this peerage , like the pope of this conclave , dominated , first from being perched aloft on his barrel , then with an indefinable look , proud , fierce , and formidable , which made his eyes glint and refined on his savage profile the brutish character of the truand race
maître charmolue displayed an intimidating register , and began reading with a wealth of gesture and the exaggerated accents of advocacy a latin oration in which all the evidence of the charges was stacked upon ciceronian periphrases flanked by quotations from plautus , his favourite comic author
what used to be worth a shekel of silver is now worth three shekels of gold , and the farmland abandoned during the war produces nothing !
it was as if the sibilant voice had woken mâtho up , he seemed not to understand ; spendius went on :
he looked around him too , but in so lifeless and sleepy a way that the women only pointed him out to each other to scoff
meanwhile , the unknown man who had so magically changed the storm into calm ’ as our dear old corneille puts it , had modestly returned to the obscurity of his pillar , where he could no doubt have remained invisible , motionless and silent as before , had he not been drawn away by two young women who , from their place in the front row of spectators , had observed his conversation with michel giborne/jupiter
the crash of all the great double petards on st john ’ s day , a volley from a score of arquebuses , the detonation of that famous serpentine in the billy tower , which killed seven burgundians in one go on sunday , number december number during the siege of paris , the explosion of all the gunpowder in the magazine at the porte du temple , none of that could have split his eardrums more brutally at that solemn and dramatic moment than those few words from an usher ’ s mouth : his eminence monseigneur the cardinal de bourbon
the people of carthage began to hurl , over the numidians , spits , skewers , hammers ; men of whom the consuls had been afraid died from sticks thrown by women ; the punic people was exterminating the mercenaries
only noon had been punctual
the noises from the distant town were lost in the murmur of the waves
dom claude ’ s fame had spread far and wide
you don ’ t know where she is ?
but he shouted all the louder ; and in the name of their gods , he called on them to take him to the schalischim , bécause he had something to confide in him on which their safety depended
i certainly hope , la gaultière went on , that no one will apply for it
besides , every form , every deformity even , in them has a sense which renders it inviolable
maître , he stammered , my lord … sire … how should i address you ?
( most of these privileges , be it noted in passing , and there were better ones than that , had been wrung out of the king by revolts and mutinies
but he stopped , as though struck by a sudden idea
give me your orders !
he answered that he had sent a fleet by gades and thymiamata to try and reach eziongabar , rounding the southern horn and the spice promontory
and the priests of proserpine , conforming out of terror to carthage ’ s need , mumbled the eleusinian formula : pour down rain !
have you murdered them with the soldiers ?
well now , gentle captain , what has brought on such a spate of eloquence ?
when it was quite dark , hamilcar gently picked him up and without a torch went down the galley staircase
right then , sack the place !
bogeyman-monk , phantom , superstitions , all was forgotten at that moment
on his head was one of those overloaded fifteenth-century helmets , which would scare the enemy with the monsters on their peak
their plans are known !
lotus flowers surrounded a fountain , where fish swam , similar to salammbo ’ s ; then , at the back , against the temple wall , spread a vine with branches of glass and fruit of emerald : the precious stones shining through the painted columns made patterns of light on the sleeping feces
they could even , the man from carthage added , come a little closer , to a place he pointed out , where they would find food
then he leaned against one of the stone bollards in the gondelaurier porch , determined to wait until the captain came out
he was holding back with silver reins his dappled horse , dripping with sweat
the joiner is expensive , observed the king
she was careful in the morning to dress in the corner of her cell , for fear that someone living in the neighbouring attics might see her through the window
she often repeats it to herself in an undertone when she thinks she is alone
oh , how many nights have i spent gazing at it !
it will be hard to resist it , will it not ?
but while national antipathies and private grudges came to life again , they felt the danger of indulging in them
you may have known it
after his victory he should have destroyed the mercenaries
he said , seizing this pretext to come closer again to the lovely creature whom he had just frightened away
until morning the barbarians pushed each other in serried ranks from one end of the plain to the other
the crowd was teeming around her ; from time to time a man got up in a red and yellow tabard would push them into a circle , then go back and sit on a chair a few feet from the dancer , and take the goat ’ s head in his lap
you watched coldly as i wept !
cried all the girls , clapping their hands
however author and public for long afterwards felt resentment towards the cardinal
he did not utter a word ; only , at long intervals , a sob violently shook his whole body , but it was a sob without tears , like summer lightning which makes no sound
he hoped that this shared infirmity would arouse maître florian ’ s interest in favour of the condemned man
he did not have the strength to finish , and hamilcar stopped , quite astonished at such grief
she pulled her back violently , digging her nails into the girl ’ s neck
and the patricians deplored their contribution of fourteen shekels , the syssitia their , kikars of gold ; those who had given nothing complained as loudly as the others
but the carthaginians had piled up such a mass of material inside that the gates did not open
it suddenly caught the chest of the bronze colossus , which was divided into seven compartments closed by grills
they creaked , and that was all
gringoire turned to him majestically
it was a lamp burning in a shell on the pedestal of a statue wearing the cabiri cap
do you think their faces and their songs still touch me ?
meanwhile the balearic slingsmen who had gone round the corner of the palace in order to plunder more easily were halted by
that he had seen in the street , passing by beneath his window , some ribald fellows making fun of him , a gang of four of them going along with no shirts under their doublets , no crowns to their hats , wallet and bottle at their side ?
the suffete answered that a whole caravan of virgins was awaited for them : it was a long way , and would take another six moons
what more can i say , mesdamoiselles ?
then the instruments fell silent
you are the stronger
then he asked where were three boxes of psagas , intended for his use
the gypsy sat up gracefully on the officer ’ s saddle , rested her hands on the young man ’ s shoulders and gazed at him for a few seconds , as though enchanted by his good looks and the timely assistance he had just brought her
it was the may bundle which the law clerks had put down that morning at the door of a parliamentary president in honour of the feast day
the shadow ’ s hand came out from beneath the cloak and fell upon phoebus ’ arm as heavily as an eagle ’ s talon
monsieur , the rue galiache is a street running at one end into the rue de la verrerie , and at the other into the rue de la tixanderie
the stonecutter succeeded the sculptor
i am all yours , body , blood , soul , all is for you !
a stone smashed it near the hilt ; the samnite was killed and the wave of carthaginians closed in , touched him
in fact the servants had abandoned everything , believing that their master would never come back
he had not finished when narr ’ havas leapt up , pulled a javelin from his belt , and , resting his right foot on the table , hurled it at mâtho
they both went off striding down towards the cité
she thinks the same as you about these gypsy vagabonds who play their tambourines and tell fortunes
will you shut up , you cicada from hell ?
but if rabbetna triumphed , if the zaïmph was returned and carthage delivered , what did a woman ’ s life matter ?
no one looked at her as did a young numidian chief sitting at the captains ’ table , amongst the soldiers of his nation
her long eyelashes were lowered , shading her crimson cheeks
but this final blow was too harsh
the carthaginians pushed them and , at sunrise , they projected into the plain like the steps of some huge ruined stairway
but who cast down the two rows of statues ?
it is the ant-hill of all intellect
we must , however , give our friend jehan his due
but the springs would dry up by themselves ; the food would run out , the catapults would become worn out ; the mercenaries , ten times more numerous , would finally triumph
and he refused to appear before the princess
she repeated crazily : there ’ s no one here
frozen with terror , they stood undecided
today it ’ s a morality specially composed for madame the princess of flanders
jackals will lie down in your palaces , the plough will turn up your graves
when they had passed through the crowd out of the square , a horde of curious and idle people tried to follow them
the top of the walls at the end of the town stood out against the sky in uneven zigzags , and the sentries ’ lances all along it looked like a border of standing corn
they resumed their journey
the king turned round so sharply that he scraped the floor matting with the legs of his chair
the acropolis hill , in the centre of byrsa , was covered over with a litter of monuments
this scene of disorder , buried up till then in darkness , had suddenly flared up with light
they amounted to so many zones on a graduated scale of horror
the moon was shining bright
who set up their tolls all over the countryside , their justice and their executioner at every crossroads among our people ?
at last day broke ; and round them they saw a great white wall , rising sheer
whence three absolutely different aspects
a poor innocent philosopher , floundering in the darkness of calamity , with his empty fob ringing upon his hollow belly ?
from time to time he would cough
it was in order to make an end of it , and from despair , that he had set the libyans ’ camp on fire
gringoire ’ s three captors led him before this barrel , and the whole bacchanalia fell silent for a moment , except for the cauldron with the child inside
louis xi , that tireless workman who began the widespread demolition of the feudal edifice , continued by richelieu and louis xiv to the advantage of the monarchy , and completed by mirabeau to the advantage of the people , louis xi had indeed tried to break up this network of lordships which covered paris , by forcibly imposing right across it two or three ordinances of general police
every time i see it i feel happy
he asked for giddenem , the slave master ; and this personage appeared , parading his dignity in the richness of his dress ; for his tunic , split down the sides , was of fine purple , heavy rings pulled his ears down , and a golden thong , joining the strips of material wound round his legs , ran from his ankles up to his hips
everywhere he saw only eyes staring wide , as if to devour him , chattering teeth , shaking fists , and salammbo ’ s curses resounded as they were multiplied
he clicked his tongue and the man with the cutlass went on rapidly :
as for him , he had never known such a total blockade ; he could hear his stomach rumbling in surrender , and thought it very unfair that ill fate should starve his philosophy into capitulation
upon my soul , said dom claude at last , as he grasped the other man ’ s hand , i am glad to see you looking so well
the amethysts and topazes of the ceiling made quivering patches of light here and there , and as she walked salammbo turned her head a little to see them
and i will set you in good positions , very high , among the clouds , so that you can be near the eagles !
she ’ ll go out in your clothes ; you ’ ll stay behind in hers
you could hear beside the heavy doric dialect the celtic syllables ringing out like battle chariots , and ionian endings clashed with desert consonants , harsh as jackal-cries
she went so pale that taanach stopped
don ’ t worry , gringoire answered
the men from the north were swollen with a livid puffiness , while the africans , more sinewy , looked as though they had been smoked and were already going dry
thin threads , pulled from marine plants , hung between flax from egypt , greece , tap-robana , and judaea ; madrepores , like large bushes , bristled at the foot of the walls ; and there was an all-pervading indefinable smell , given out by perfumes , leather , spices , and ostrich plumes tied up in big bundles right up to the ceiling
sergeants of the wand , you ’ ll take this rascal to the pillory of the grève , you ’ ll flog him , and turn him round for an hour
and resting on both hands she leaned out trembling all over
phoebus , however , was not dead
claude , you are the fly too ! —you were flying towards knowledge , the light , the sun , your only concern was to reach the open air , the broad daylight of eternal truth ; but in your rush towards the dazzling window that opens on to that other world , the world of clarity , intelligence , and knowledge , blind fly , demented doctor , you did not see the subtle spider ’ s web stretched by destiny between the light and you , you rushed into it headlong , wretched fool , and now you struggle , with your head smashed in and your wings ripped off , in the iron grip of fate ’ s antennae ! —maître jacques !
their cries grew louder
i ’ m determined to hear no more of that
their army was about , men , and several times they had the pleasure of seeing the carthaginians retreat
what did it matter in any case !
i hope that settles it
a girl was humming :
the hangman took advantage of that moment swiftly to break the grip of the arms with which she clasped the condemned girl
a murmur of satisfaction broke out among the crowd
the gallery of the kings of france today stands about sixty feet above the pavement
the provincial was certainly about to lose her temper for the honour of her pillory
he spent long hours looking at the aqueduct , and so persistently that he no doubt wanted to mislead the carthaginians as to his real intentions
the balearic fastened a pick and mallet to it and went back
the person whom he designated by that name took back the register from his hands and began again reading aloud :
they dozed with their eyes only half closed
he had seen her and her goat take the rue de la coutellerie ; he had taken the rue de la coutellerie
they are your good friends , the barbarians !
the churches had their sanctity to protect them
however he did not talk of the rabbet
the former slave practised for several days shooting arrows at flamingoes on the lake
said robin poussepain , still aching and bruised all over from his fall
show me that shoe , said the gypsy , giving a start
he threw himself at the arm holding the cutlass crying : quasimodo !
such doors are only ever used for entrance
truth to tell , he was afraid of being hanged
these , men were crammed into the kind of hippodrome which the mountain formed round them
i know a finer one , she said
then she felt horror rise to the roots of her hair , and she heard the dismal laugh of the recluse whispering : ha !
o god , god , it would have been better never to have given her to me at all if you were going to take her back so soon
he answered , hitting his head with clenched fists :
it was her advocate
it would seem that claude frollo had experienced it
you ’ ll be called the blind man
the chain has been stretched across the street all night , and the chain-keeper has seen no one go by
scraps of matting closing the doors beat against the walls
the great star went down into the sea as the beating lessened ; at the last palpitation it disappeared
the three women thought she was dead
this is the little girl you won ’ t reject , who has come , come in person , to find you
you are wearing them out !
the escort lined up on either side
there was one on each rung
the trapdoor opened , a light reappeared
so it ’ s all over !
the barbarians established at hippo-zarytus saw his army as it went down the mountain
but the pontiff of eschmoûn rose , and with knees together , elbows held in , erect and with hands half open , he said :
how sad it is to think that all that once existed and now there ’ s nothing of it left !
besides , he was a man of changeable moods and , need it be said ?
poor grain of millet given over by human justice to be ground in the fearful mills of torture !
but the avoyer scharnachtal rushed on the fine duke with his club and his people , and when they clashed with these peasants in their buffalo skins , the shining burgundian army shattered like a pane of glass hit by a stone
brother , you were so right when you told me : jehan , jehan , cessat doctorum doctrina , discipulorum disciplina [ the teaching of the teachers , the discipline of the disciples has slackened off ]
it was a rather long climb
it ’ s triton , she answered
thus the unfortunate man ’ s fever or madness had reached such a degree of intensity that the outside world had become for him nothing but a kind of visible , palpable , terrifying apocalypse
round his neck could be seen gleaming the golden cockleshells of the collar of saint-michel
a wooden disc gave way , and there soon appeared along the length of the corridor several of the large lids which sealed the pits in which grain was kept
but the greek raised his voice , and recounting the crimes of hanno , whom he knew to be barca ’ s enemy , trying to move him with details of their suffering and memories of their loyalty , he spoke for a long time , rapidly , insidiously , even violently ; in the end he forgot himself , carried away by the fervour of his mind
here louis xiv ’ s palaces , long barracks for courtiers , stiff , glacial , boring
but whether from fear or hunger they all took their way homewards and disappeared
the poor devil clearly had a choice of nicknames
the monstrous bell whinnied , panting beneath him , and then it was no longer the bourdon of notre-dame or quasimodo , it was a dream , a whirlwind , a tempest ; vertigo riding on sound ; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper ; a strange centaur , half man , half bell ; a kind of horrible astolfo carried away on a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze
there was another fine part , that of dom pedro , king of mesopotamia
the archdeacon was the first to break the silence
now , giving the great bell in marriage to quasimodo was like giving juliet to romeo
her chin rested on her knees , which her two crossed arms held tightly against her chest
i ’ ve lost my notebooks
the archdeacon looked at him gloomily
they reminded each other , with roars of greedy delight , of the fine silver crosses , the fine brocade copes , the fine silver-gilt tombs , the great splendours of the choir , the dazzling festivals , christmas sparkling with torches , easter brilliant with sunshine , all those spendid solemnities at which shrines , candlesticks , ciboria , tabernacles , reliquaries made the altars look as though embossed with a covering of gold and diamonds
he picked himself up and reached the water ’ s edge
i ’ ll let you know , he stammered in a barely articulate voice
this confused mass of corpses filled the entire mountain-side from top to bottom
our philosopher stood dumbfounded , his eyes passing bemused from the goat to the girl in turn
pardon me , my lord king of tunis , replied gringoire , fighting every inch of the ground
then , when the barbarians had gone , spendius went round the plain , riding a punic stallion and with his slave leading a third horse
this sounded most doleful in the dark , and their faces paled as they looked at one another
la esmeralda picked up the ill-fated letters in an instant , beckoned to djali , and went out by one door as fleur-de-lys was carried out by the other
independently of these two main streets , diametrically cutting across the width of paris from side to side , common to the whole capital , town and university each had their own particular main street , running lengthways across them , parallel with the seine , intersecting the two arterial streets at right angles
parliament was wary of bishops , and when it came to a clash between the two robes , the magistrate ’ s cimarra was not evenly matched against the cassock
the population was jealous of the new-carthaginians who had been promised full citizenship ; and even the ligurians , who had fought so bravely , were associated with the barbarians , and equally cursed ; their race became a crime , a complicity
then stay here , she went on imperiously , and let ’ s watch to the end
she put her daughter down , for she was still carrying her , in a corner of the cell which could not be seen from outside
he stretched out his arm towards the cité
spendius , leaping from terrace to terrace and jumping over hedges and streams , had escaped from the gardens
wondered spendius ; and as he was expecting to benefit from any disorder , he was grateful to narr ’ havas for the future perfidy of which he suspected him
the man who admires caesar blames catilina
the burghers let the wind blow out the candles in their windows , and let their dogs stray ; the iron chains were only put up when the city was under siege ; the prohibition on carrying daggers changed nothing but the name of the rue coupe-gueule which became the rue coupe-gorge , an obvious sign of progress
henriet cousin grasped the girl round the middle , under her lovely shoulders
they were looked on as cruel masters , to be appeased with supplications and bribed by presents
are you sure she ’ ll come ?
when they rose to the surface again they by for a few minutes stretched out on their backs , sniffing the air in delight
they thought they would have no ropes strong enough to hoist him to the top of the cross , and nailed him to it , before it was put up , in the punic fashion
on top of the gorge stretched out a plain dotted with shrubs ; the barbarians devoured the shoots
i am , answered the man in black
orpheus ’ letters of stone were succeeded by gutenberg ’ s letters of lead
besides the barbarians might beat them
he has half risen from his immense armchair , his clenched fists are resting on the table and he is gazing , curious and terrified , at a great luminous circle , composed of magic letters , shining on the far wall , like the solar spectrum in a camera obscura
he wept with rage over all these mysteries of love , now profaned , soiled , exposed , withered for ever
he found himself in the gallery with the fearsome bell-ringer , alone , separated from his companions by a vertical wall number feet high
more than once , in choir , during the office , the occupant of the neighbouring stall had heard him mingling unintelligible parentheses into the plainchant ad omnem tonum [ in every tone ]
they wore white woollen cloaks , long daggers , leather necklets , wooden earrings , boots of hyena skin ; and they stayed at the entrance leaning on their lances like shepherds resting
lord jesus , how beautiful she is !
someone cried out that he had been poisoned
watch out , any pregnant women !
that resplendent figure standing out like something luminous in the light of the sun itself !
she draws all her fecundity from the other !
and how do you earn your living ?
the hangman , who had not loosed the girl , started up the ladder again
said gringoire and fell back on the pont-au-change
it ’ s for you to wish it
with decretals digested , he threw himself into medicine and the liberal arts
the trampled earth was covered with pools of red
meanwhile , ever since tristan had seen her daughter and all hope was lost , the recluse had not uttered a word
the quay at that point ran upwards
the numidians , covered in white cloaks , let out loud cries , raised their arms as their knees gripped their prancing stallions , turned them round suddenly , then disappeared
it was already close on seventeen years since he had , on number november number , in the year of the comet , number received from the king this fine post of provost of paris , reputed more of a lordship than an office
the microscope had not yet been invented , either for material things of for those of the spirit
the effect of this proposal on gringoire can easily be imagined ; he had seen his life running out and had begun to let it go
then they did not dare look , they could no longer see her , but they heard kisses and sighs without number mixed with heart-rending cries and dull thuds as of a head banging against a wall
he appears : he ’ s a hunchback
gringoire , following the gypsy , had entered the impenetrable maze of alleys , crossroads , and cul-de-sacs surrounding the ancient burial place of the holy innocents , which resembled nothing so much as a skein of thread tangled up by a cat
the other went on : god ’ s head !
you are lying , said the shadow coldly
i want to keep my child !
hence innumerable optical illusions , innumerable aberrations of judgement , innumerable diversions for his errant thoughts , now wild , now idiotic
the student boldly entered
they clutched each other lying on their bellies like wrestlers
these objects were of so little value that the hangman had no doubt not wanted them
the townsfolk are lighting their candles and god lights up his stars
i ’ d like to be wholly animal , like that goat
when do we start ?
bravely spoken , sir gilles lecornu , master skinner and furrier of the king ’ s wardrobe !
then , at the fence , with a leap it jumped into a palm-tree
finally mâtho looked up at him , his eyes full of distress
there were also , passim , hebrew scribbles , of which jehan , who had very little greek , understood nothing , and it was all crossed , here , there , and everywhere by stars , human or animal figures , and intersecting triangles , which went quite a long way to making the wall of the cell , covered in scrawls , look like a sheet of paper over which a monkey had been tracing a pen full of ink
trade is incompatible with nobility
quasimodo came up stealthily behind him to see what he was looking at
how happy we could be !
spendius treated his men gently , dreamed of plans ; he tried to remember stratagems which he had heard about in the course of his travels
mother , it was the dog
i know lots of very attractive tricks to teach your goat ; for instance , how to mimic that damned pharisee the bishop of paris , whose mill-wheels splash passers-by the whole length of the pont-aux-meuniers
so he hurried to get near the splendid bonfire blazing in the middle of the square
my companions , one by one , are dying around me ; the stench of their corpses wakes me up at night ; i chase away the birds that come to peck out their eyes ; and yet , not once , have i despaired of carthage !
the bell-ringer saw him still trying to cling to the gable with his fingernails
speak a word to me , i beseech you !
he supposed that it could only be him
do you see that demon going to and fro in front of the fire ?
the two of them lived in reims by the riverside , in the rue de folle-peine
he overcame that weakness , however , and said curtly : it is the king ’ s will
dear cousin , i have been recalled to garrison duty
it was a miracle from the good lord
these words , uttered in a tone of reproachful surprise , drew the attention of the archdeacon once more to this unknown stranger , from whom , truth to tell , it had not been fully diverted for a moment since he had crossed the cell ’ s threshold
i tell you it wasn ’ t !
a gigantic cross had been put up at the gate
his eyes staring fixedly at hers upset her ; and this unease , this repugnance increased so sharply that salammbo made an effort not to cry out
but he was fidgeting with shame and annoyance ; salammbo , who was eagerly helping him , was as pale as he was
i don ’ t know your mahé fédy , but he ’ s a nasty man
suddenly , just as the rotating wheel presented quasimodo ’ s mountainous back to maître pierrat , the latter raised his arm
but that image was no longer the same colour ; it was gloomy , funereal , dark as the black circle which long dogs the sight of anyone who has been unwise enough to stare at the sun
as they became progressively more drunk they increasingly recalled the injustice of carthage
i do not think that there can be anything in the world happier than the thoughts awakened in a mother ’ s heart at the sight of her child ’ s little shoe
this mass came down to the water ’ s edge
utica , at the head of a bay , was convenient for bringing in outside help to carthage
one morning in the month of tammouz !
i don ’ t know , replied one of his neighbours
fair cousin , fleur-de-lys answered in vexed tones , i ’ ve told you three times already
besides , they , especially the northerners , were vaguely uneasy , disturbed , already ill ; they tore their hands on the prickles of the aloes ; big mosquitoes buzzed in their ears , and dysentery began to afflict the army
the rich , carrying sceptres with emerald knobs , came out from megara ; the elders , wearing diadems , had assembled in kinisdo , and the masters of the finances , provincial governors , merchants , soldiers , sailors , and the numerous horde employed at funerals , all , with the insignia of their office or the tools of their trade , made towards the tabernacles which were coming down from the acropolis , between the colleges of pontiffs
he murmured , i ’ ve been crying !
don ’ t look at me
silence , the churls at the end of the hall !
we want to go away !
for having needed so much persuading
he was thinking that the goat too according to existing legislation ’ would be hanged if recaptured ; that that would be a great pity , poor djali !
louis xi went on
as a reward for your services rendered to me , narr ’ havas , i give you my daughter
the evening breeze blew ; then every chest expanded ; and as it became increasingly cool , the vermin could be seen leaving the dead , who were growing cold , to run over the hot sand
he did it to give work to those damned singers of the king of sicily !
at length she came to sit by the table and gringoire was able to contemplate her at leisure
madame de gondelaurier went on : beautiful tapestries , indeed
she shuddered ( everything frightened her now ) and looked
it ’ s true that the idea seems to repel you ; and that ’ s simply because you ordinary citizens are not used to it
the dust around them settled , and they had begun to sing when hanno himself appeared up on an elephant
some had stopped suffering , and whiled away the hours by relating to each other the dangers from which they had escaped
go in there , my dear fellow , he said to his companion
it must be said , in praise of the age-old good sense of curious parisians , that the majority of this crowd was making for the bonfire , which came very seasonably , or the mystery , to be performed in the sheltered and enclosed great hall of the palais , and that , by common consent , the curious left the poor maypole , with its scanty garlands , to shiver all alone under the january sky in the cemetery of the chapel of braque
the high society of the time scarcely knew the name of the victim passing by at the corner of the street , and it was at most only the common people who regaled themselves with such coarse fare
taanach had scarcely returned when she was going down the galley staircase
they did not wear rings , or gold crosses , and it was easy to see that in their case this was due not to poverty but quite simply for fear of incurring a fine
as for him , he thought that at the very most his hearing was a little refractory
they are books wrapped in obscurity which only initiates can decipher
there are too many gauls , they are drunkards !
suddenly she said ; they are coming closer
mâtho passed beneath him
but apollo himself served as herdsman to admetus
to see her and not embrace her !
i have climbed the steps of eschmoûn , god of the planets and the intelligences ; i have slept beneath the golden olive-tree of melkarth , patron of the tyrian colonies ; i have pushed at the doors of baal-khamon , pioneer and fertilizer ; i have sacrificed to the underground cabiri , to the gods of the woods , the winds , the rivers and the mountains : but they are all too remote , too lofty , too unfeeling , do you understand ?
devil take that one-eyed hunchback !
the archdeacon continued , now seemingly answering only his own thoughts : no , i am still crawling , scraping my face and knees on the stones of the underground path
i do not believe in astrology
how old were you when you came to france ?
claude , in the state of hallucination in which he found himself , thought he was seeing with his living eyes the steeple of hell ; the countless lights distributed along the whole height of the horrifying tower appeared to him like so many openings into the huge inner furnaces ; the voices and murmurs coming from it , like so many cries , so many death-rattles
the hairs that are missing from your whores ’ heads we find in your omelettes
he passed his hand over his brow as if to drive away the idea obsessing him
the girl answered , like the lamb in the story : alas !
said jupiter , as if waking up with a start
this first line of walls immediately sheltered malqua , the sailors ’ and dyers ’ quarter
there were some children involved in this orgy
while this hurricane of despair shattered , smashed , tore up , bent , uprooted everything in his soul , he looked at nature around him
the stranger broke it
the night is far advanced and we are closer to morning than evening
gringoire went on , trying to revert to his question in a roundabout way
anyone would think that there were six centuries between that door and those pillars
gentlemen , he said , and ladies , citizens of this town , we are to have the honour of declaiming and performing before his eminence monsieur le cardinal a very fine morality play entitled : the good judgement of our lady the virgin mary
the university too had its own
who cut that new and bastard ogive right in the middle of the central doorway ?
the two of them lying like that upon the ground , the mother on top of her daughter , made a pitiable sight
the wind , which was blowing very hard , was driving along swirls of sand ; they rose up as if snatched from the ground , climbed in great tawny streamers , then ripped apart and repeatedly formed again , hiding the punic army from the mercenaries
standing around the king uselessly like that they put me in mind of the four evangelists round the dial of the great clock in the palais , which philippe brille has just renovated
it was really fine
no , mahiette answered
where is she then ?
according to spendius , they should carefully keep their present position and starve out the punic army
salammbo turned round , a finger to her lips , as a sign to be discreet and still
the master , who knew these tricks , took a horn full of balm , brought it close to the coals and then tipped it over his robe ; a brown patch appeared , so it was a fraud
two more days passed
why are those rascals making that infernal noise , like men possessed ?
as soon as they reached the entrance to the courtyard their bearing became calm again
he swung the long axe at him ; people rushed on schahabarim ; and mâtho , losing sight of him , fell back , exhausted
every century has its st peter ’ s , rome ; in the seventeenth century the val-de-grâce , in the eighteenth sainte-geneviève
then he bent over henriet cousin ’ s ear and whispered : get it over quickly !
he said to the actors ; and if i get paid you will be
when evening came he escaped from the town with his escort , then went into the mountains to rejoin his army
they untied him and the crowd dispersed
my dear , fair child , your life is in danger , and so is djali ’ s
look at the old pig !
we shall start again , don ’ t leave me any more !
the gypsy approached the noble lady
neither their looking in nor their tears , however , had distracted the recluse
around the halles it was like a many-pointed star
what a predestined name
the crime is patent and the hour is late
we would run away—i would make you run away—we would go somewhere , look for the place on earth with the most sunshine , the most trees , the most blue sky
those aren ’ t just dreams—it is the general law of nature
jupiter , whose thunder could be heard rumbling from the dressing room , supported her , and the goddess was about to win the prize , that is , in plain terms , to marry monsieur le dauphin , when a little girl , dressed in white damask and holding in her hand a marguerite daisy ( a transparent personification of the princess of flanders ) had come to contend with venus
has she at least left me a bed ?
drinking tents had been set up
and you are often alone with her ?
it had been prepared to that end early that morning ; its rich slab of marble , scored by the heels of the law clerks , bore a frame of scaffolding of a considerable height , the upper surface of which , visible from every part of the hall , was to serve as the stage , while the inside , screened by tapestries , was to be used as a dressing room for the actors
then she went trembling to lift up a large stone and brought back an amphora of wine with fish from hippo-zarytus preserved in honey
monsieur , said the neighbour , on the right are the counsellors of the great chamber , and on the left the counsellors of the chambre des enquêtes , the maîtres are in black robes , the messires in red ones
so you fear them more than me !
meanwhile the spell was gradually working , your dance whirled round in my brain , i felt the mysterious malefice taking effect within me , all that should have been vigilant in my soul fell asleep , and like those who die in the snow i enjoyed letting sleep come
have pity , girl ; have pity on me !
my pretty little daughter !
you will fall , carthage !
it is true that no one was less interested in monuments than our good onlookers of the middle ages , and they cared very little about the beauty of a pillory
the truands put up a brave fight
he repeated , and opened his hands to clap
the other did not notice
i shan ’ t sleep until the gypsy girl has been hanged
a plague on the stupid , dim-witted girl !
the key to the red door ( continued )
and by them , liénarde went on , several bass instruments were playing most tunefully
the capital reserves of strength which human thought once spent on buildings are henceforth spent on books
she swiftly went forward
he still had , africans , , greeks , , campanians , iberians ; etruscans , samnites , gauls and a troop of naffur , nomadic bandits met with in the date country , in all , soldiers , but not a complete syntagma
it was becoming intolerable
suddenly she stopped , and they stayed looking at each other open-mouthed
each race as it passed by wrote its line in the book ; it erased the old romanesque hieroglyphs on the frontispieces of the cathedrals , and at the very most the dogma remains still visible here and there through the new symbolism overlaying it
that soul fell into darkest night
but when the bell-ringer , dishevelled and panting , put her down in the cell of refuge , when she felt his great hands undo the cord which was bruising her arms , she experienced the kind of shock which wakes up passengers with a start when their ship grounds in the middle of a dark night
then a scruple worried him
but it is not so
repeated the gypsy girl
he went red , he went white , then he loosed her and looked at her with a sombre expression
he looked her up and down , holding her between his legs , and repeated :
i ’ m going to have you hanged to amuse the truands and you ’ re going to give them your purse to drink to it
all that remained was the slight murmur always given off by a silent crowd
now that ’ s none of my business , and i ’ ll come to the point
the four characters , their bows amply rewarded by applause , embarked , amid a religious silence , on a prologue , which we gladly spare our readers
from the length of the veil which fell from the top of their pointed head-dress , all wound about with pearls , down to their heels , from the delicacy of the embroidered chemisette covering their shoulders and revealing , in the attractive fashion of the times , the cleavage of their beautiful maidenly bosoms , from the opulence of their underskirts , even more costly than their topcoats ( a wonderful refinement !
he had put down his rope on the ground , and was awkwardly rolling his hat in his hands
he tried playing at knucklebones as a distraction , and lost , one after another , the gold plates from his collar
in front of the bedstead was a copper bowl for alms
this exclamation of distress , far from exciting compassion , was added entertainment for the good parisian people round the ladder and who , it must be said , taken in the mass and as a multitude , were then scarcely less cruel and less brutalized than that horrible tribe of truands to whom we have already introduced the reader , and who were quite simply the lowest stratum of the people
you could see from the way her belt came up above her hips that she had not been long in paris
mâtho , breathing hard , stayed with his eyes gazing at the floor
people repeated the number of six thousand barbarians killed ; the rest would not hold out , the war was over ; people kissed in the streets , and smeared butter and cinnamon on the faces of the pataeci gods in thanksgiving
it was nowhere to be seen
you know that it is always the body that ruins the soul
down below he spied the harbours , the squares , the inside of the courtyards , the plan of the streets , the tiny men almost level with the paving stones
are you looking for marie la giffarde ?
once he left a broomstick on my roof-leads
all was eclipsed in the common licence
the wretched girl trembled in every limb
jehan muttered in his beard
surely you didn ’ t want the king to fall sick again ?
captain phoebus , left alone , hesitated for a moment between the two doors ; then followed the gypsy girl
my dear , fleur-de-lys continued rather acidly , you ’ ll get yourself picked up by the sergeants of the douzaine for that gilt belt of yours
and it will always be like that , so long as there are lords in the lordships , townsfolk in the towns , and country folk in the country
now it was a stealthy brat risking skin and bones for the ineffable delight of sticking a pin into quasimodo ’ s hump
there must be something really curious about this cell that my reverend brother hides like his pudendum !
finally they produced books
he rushed to hippo-zarytus , to the works in the mountains , came back , gave himself no rest
the place de grève
first they were served birds in green sauce , on red earthenware plates decorated with black patterns , then all the kinds of shellfish found on the punic shores , porridge of wheat , beans , and barley , and snails in cumin , on plates of golden amber
everyone knows that once you ’ ve ridden a bear you ’ re cured of fear , but you have a nose for a dainty morsel , like saint-jacques de l ’ hôpital
and by an optical illusion peculiar to judicial proceedings , those same spectators who had perhaps more than once applauded djali ’ s innocent tricks at street corners , were terrified by them under the vaulting of the palais de justice
that ’ s a most improper way to speak
as they put out their tongues they looked as though they were trying to force out their souls ; and every shape was to be found there , as if a seed pod had burst in a sudden explosion and emptied itself over the walls of the room
i could sob like a child , i could rip from my breast not just words , but my heart and my entrails to tell you i love you , but it would all be in vain , all of it !
we shall content ourselves with the fragments of hermes ’ books that we have here
as at times of plague , all the houses were closed ; the streets filled up , suddenly emptied ; people went up to the acropolis ; ran down to the port ; every night the grand council deliberated
in the eighteenth , after its long years of repose at louis xiv ’ s court , it takes up once more luther ’ s old sword , arms voltaire with it , and rushes tumultuously to attack the old europe whose architectural expression it had already killed
holes dug in the sand showed water : and already some were stretched out full length drinking it
i became a monk , but i wasn ’ t devout enough
worshipful citizens , he shouted with all the power in his lungs to the crowd which went on booing , we are starting at once
the road crossed a field , set with long slabs , pointed on top like pyramids , with an open hand fixed in the middle as if the dead person lying beneath had stretched it out to heaven to ask for something
two tables away a coquillart , in full pilgrim ’ s garb , was spelling out the complaint of sainte-reine , not forgetting the chant and the nasal whine
and from his chest he pulled off the antelope skin steeped in poisons so that they should fashion him a breastplate stouter than those of bronze , resistant to steel and fire
i turn round , you are not there !
the parallel beams running across the ceiling amused the eye with hundreds of strange sculptures , painted and gilded
then he was bound on to the elephant , his arms and legs in a cross ; and all who were not wounded escorted him and rushed tumultuously towards carthage
do you think you are my master ?
you ’ re going to be hanged !
phoebus , fleur-de-lys suddenly murmured , we are to be married in three months ’ time , swear that you have never loved any other girl but me
the seventh compartment gaped wide
he is anything but generous in his treatment of men of letters , and he goes in for the most barbaric cruelties
in fact i am rather poor
below , in the depths of the concert , you can vaguely make out the singing from inside the churches , seeping through the vibrating pores of their vaulted ceilings
fires , around which strange groups swarmed , glowed brightly here and there
he told spendius that if hamilcar did not arrive before three days were up , he would go forward with all his men to offer battle
his colleague gisco on the contrary wanted them to be paid
to work , bully boys !
gringoire , in this wretched state , was no doubt not very attractive
he looked successively at the impassive sculptures of the tower , like him suspended over the precipice , but feeling no terror for themselves nor pity for him
upon my soul , i could say the pater and the ave maria , and the credo in deum omnipotentem [ i believe in god the father almighty ] without her taking any more notice of me than a hen of a church
they announced that towns had been devastated , the countryside set on fire , soldiers massacred ; you were the one who destroyed them , you murdered them !
it was the goddess ’ s mantle , the holy zaïmph which no one might see
he took a little metal whistle out of his pocket
it ’ s not my fault
he was a proper devil , very unruly , which made dom claude frown , but very droll and very crafty , which made his big brother smile
imagine a series of faces successively presenting every geometrical shape , from the triangle to the trapezium , from the cone to the polyhedron—every human expression , from anger to lust—every age of man , from the wrinkles of the new-born baby to the wrinkles of the dying old crone ; every religious phantasmagoria , from faunus to beelzebub ; every animal profile , from jaw to beak , from snout to muzzle
aymoin tells of a stag , hunted by dagobert , which sought refuge by the tomb of saint-denys ; the hounds stopped dead , still baying
that ’ s the gallery of the kings of france
they got lost , turned round , came back
every moment swirling masses of men came up ; the tents cracked , collapsed ; the crowd squeezed between the ramparts shouted and swayed from the gates of the camp to its centre
they had to grow what suited the republic , provide what it demanded ; no one had the right to possess a weapon ; when villages revolted the inhabitants were sold ; governors were assessed like presses according to the quantity they extracted
it dragged itself along , pathetically begging its way round the studio from copy to copy
the respective positions of the two arts will be reversed
jacques d ’ espars would have admitted him as a physician , richard hellain as a surgeon
then the idea occurred to me of abducting you
zarxas had leaped upon it and , lighter than a leopard , ran towards the carthaginians
the same age that my daughter would be if her mother hadn ’ t eaten my daughter
a great golden cross and a line of candles moved off in the shadows
my man , will you kindly let go of my horse ’ s bridle ?
suddenly everything went black ahead of them and the speed of the water redoubled they fell
here is the greek pediment inscribed in the roman pediment , and vice versa
take away the printing press and heresy is enervated
sometimes they thought the barbarians were coming ; they had been seen behind the hot-springs mountain ; they were encamped at tunis ; and voices multiplied , swelled , mingled in a single clamour
the door opened at once and revealed to the newcomers an old woman and an old lamp , both trembling
he had carefully stopped up the light from his dark lantern
but once past the door one found oneself in a vast square courtyard , lined by arches
it ’ s quite simple , messieurs , all you respectable citizens , we treat your people in our city just as you treat ours in yours
there are the real pincers made red-hot in hell-fire !
let her mumble her phoebus as much as she likes
two days later the weather cleared and hunger seized them again
pyramidal like the lighthouse of alexandria , it was cubits high and wide , with nine storeys diminishing towards the top and defended by bronze scales , with numerous openings , full of soldiers ; on the upper platform stood a catapult flanked by two balistae
every day unknown men invaded the gardens of megara ; the slaves , fearful for themselves , did not dare resist them
you ’ re quite out of breath , old fellow !
i am innocent of this civil tempest
can you condemn a poor mother to fifteen years of such torture ?
the musicians sometimes stopped in exhaustion ; then the cries of the mothers could be heard and the sizzling of fat falling on the embers
clearly distinguishable within it , though skilfully attached to the main building by long galleries with stained-glass windows and rows of pillars , were the three mansions which charles v had amalgamated with his palace , the hôtel du petit-muce , its roof trimmed with a graceful , lacy balustrade , the hôtel of the abbot of saint-maur , with the lines of a fortress , a massive tower , machicolations , loopholes , iron moineaux [ bastions ] , and over its wide saxon gateway the abbot ’ s coat of arms between the two grooves for the drawbridge ; the hôtel of the comte d ’ étampes , the top of its round keep in ruins and jagged like a coxcomb ; here and there three or four old oaks , clumped together like huge cauliflowers , swans disporting themselves in the clear waters of the fishponds , all striped with light and shade ; numerous courtyards revealing picturesque corners ; the lion house , with low gothic arches on short saxon pillars , its iron portcullises , and continual roaring ; cutting across the whole the scaly spire of the ave-maria ; to the left , the residence of the provost of paris flanked by four delicately hollowed-out turrets ; in the centre , at the back , the hôtel saint-pol proper , with its multiple façades , its successive enrichments since charles v ’ s time , the hybrid excrescences piled on it over two centuries by the fancies of architects , with all the apses of its chapels , the gables of its galleries , hundreds of weathervanes , and two lofty , contiguous towers , whose conical roofs , with crenellations round their base , looked like pointed hats with the brim turned up
he no longer knew where he was , what he was thinking about , whether he was dreaming
the creature in its fury enclosed him with its beating wings ; he clasped it to his chest , and as it began to die he laughed louder than ever , in proud bursts like clashing swords
perhaps he had mind to offer a sacrifice
zarxas ran up , knocked him down and plunged a dagger into his throat ; pulling it out , he flung himself upon the wound – and with his mouth glued to it , with grunts of joy and spasms which shook him from head to foot , he pumped out the blood with all his might ; then he quietly sat down on the corpse , lifted up his face and threw back his head to breathe more freely , like a deer which has just drunk from a stream , and in a shrill voice intoned a balearic song , a vague tune full of extended , broken , alternating modulations , like answering echoes in the mountains ; he called on his dead brothers and invited them to a feast ; then he dropped his hands in his lap , slowly lowered his head and wept
by the way , he said , was there not someone in that cage ?
soon there was nothing there but a patch of white in the half-light ; then nothing
they only found there the bare necessities ; then , looking harder , three images of tanit , and , in a monkey skin , a black stone which had fallen from the moon
if it was a farce , that would be fine
the mother too kept her eyes closed
we ’ ll have a pretty little nest somewhere
such tiny feet that people came to see them out of curiosity from épernay , and that ’ s seven leagues distant !
she had confided her resolve to no one ; in order to carry it out more discreetly she sent taanach to buy in the suburb of kinisdo ( instead of asking the intendants for them ) all the things that she needed : vermilion , perfumes , a linen girdle , and new clothes
in the space enclosed by the tables , the python from the temple of eschmoûn lay on the ground , between flasks of rose oil , biting his tail to describe a great black circle
these women who live by love need a lover or a child to fill their hearts
his bristled with ten iron beaks , so that jehan could have challenged nestor ’ s homeric ship for the redoubtable epithet δεκέβoλos [ ten-beaked ]
the fact is that they said things to make a cardinal gasp
the only marguerites you know are the daisies that your april meadow gives your cows to graze on !
before each of the tabernacles a man balanced on his head a large jar in which incense smoked
if those stones could speak , he murmured , yes , they would say : there is a most unhappy man
yes , she said ; the executioner mocks the condemned man
strike my heart and think no more about it !
here they served jehan his supper
beside him , his doctor , standing motionless in a long yellow robe , had the bath heated up from time to time , and two boys leaning on the steps of the pool rubbed his legs
quasimido , meanwhile , had reached him , and boldly seized the horse ’ s bridle : follow me , captain !
when you appear , stillness sweeps over the earth , flowers close , the waves die down , weary men stretch out with their breast towards you , and the world with its oceans and mountains sees itself in your face , as though in a mirror
try indeed to imagine , in the middle of a theatrical performance , a yelping usher interjecting between two rhymes , and often between two hemistichs , such parentheses as these : maître jacques charmolue , the king ’ s attorney in the ecclesiastical court ! —jehan de harlay , esquire , keeper of the office of chevalier of the night watch of the town of paris ! —messire galiot de genoilhac , knight , seigneur de brussac , master of the king ’ s artillery ! —maître dreux-raguier , inspector of waters and forests of our lord the king for the île-de-france , champagne , and brie ! —messire louis de graville , knight , counsellor , and chamberlain to the king , admiral of france , guardian of the forest of vincennes ! —maître denis le mercier , keeper of the hospital for the blind of paris ! —etc , etc
true , the night was very dark , la esmeralda , if she had stayed where she was ( and he did not doubt that she had ) was a good way off , and it was as much as he could do himself to make out the lovers on the balcony
his shoulders were bleeding , his chest heaved in convulsive gasps ; and he made such an effort to break his bonds that his arms crossed on his bare back swelled up like the coils of a snake
if we assume that the poet ’ s entity is represented by the number ten , it is certain that a chemist , analysing and , as rabelais puts it , pharmacopolizing it , would find it composed of one part of self-interest to nine of self-esteem
i don ’ t know , he said
then he rubbed the horses ’ nostrils with blood to revive them
she fastened to the edge of her shoulder a purple square , weighted at the bottom with sandastrum grains ; and over all these clothes she put on a black cloak with a trailing train ; then she contemplated her , and , proud of her work could not help saying :
here is the final sentence ; add to it maître charmolue ’ s hoarse voice and breathless gestures :
the spectators in the windows could see at the bottom of the tumbril her bare legs which she was trying to tuck out of sight beneath her as though from a last feminine instinct
sometimes a gazelle could be seen , trailing scattered peacock feathers on its small black hoofs
but sentries perpetually marched round them
just imagine , master , i ’ ve seen the king
he recognized the red door with the black cross
the hangman and the sergeants entered the cell
gringoire ’ s first concern on getting into the boat was to take the goat on his knees
do you know quasimodo , mesdemoiselles ?
he calls him his child !
twelve blue crystal globes surrounded it in a circle , supported by monsters which looked like tigers
the shape of her body was of astonishing beauty
all over the plain lay lions and corpses , and the dead were mixed up with clothes and armour
in the middle a leather mattress lay almost touching the ground , and hanging above it was a strap with a buckle , fastened to a brass ring held in the jaws of a flat-nosed monster carved on the keystone of the vault
but the captains did not understand punic any more than the soldiers , although the mercenaries greeted each other in that language
he detailed all the purifications and fasts that she should perform and told her how to reach mâtho
what are you talking about , beautiful angel ?
they belong to their age
– the republic is in a sorry state !
la smeralda , phoebus said gaily
it was first agreed to ask the romans for help , and this mission was offered to spendius ; as a deserter he did not dare accept it
the mercenaries ’ hoplites were put in the front rank ; behind them the slingers and cavalry ; right at the back baggage , wagons , horses ; on the near side of this mass , paces from the towers , bristled the machines
he consulted all the soothsayers in the army , one after another , those who observe snakes ’ trails , those who read in the stars , those who blow on the ashes of the dead
a cloud of steam from the hot food rose up into the foliage mingled with the vapours exhaled by the crowd
i ’ ve even kept her shoe these fifteen years
rétif de la bretonne brings up his hod full of plaster
then could be seen laid out , in unequal sums , coins of all values , sizes , and periods – from old assyrian coins , thin as a finger nail , to old ones from latium , thicker than a hand , with buttons from aegina , tablets from bactria , short rods from ancient sparta ; many were covered in rust , or dirt , green from water or black from fire , having been picked up in nets or in the ruins of some besieged town
the runner rummaged to right and left
meanwhile , as he passed from time to time the last groups of townsfolk closing their doors , he caught some scraps of their conversations which broke the thread of his attractive hypotheses
some even came out of the ground as far as their bellies
come and see yours !
young girl , look at the heart
i assume that this hole is jointly inhabited by bats and spiders , and is consequently the scene of a double war of extermination against flies )
but hamilcar wanted first to show the mercenaries that he would punish them like slaves
do you promise it will be a fine mystery today ?
the elephants , who had run away , were roaming on the horizon with their towers on fire
it was not unlike the struggle between don juan and the statue
besides , they have a whiff of the sabbath about them
we shall know the right men from their fleetness of foot and the strength of their blow
he remained dumbfounded for some moments , finally breaking the silence with an attempt at laughter
the villages he went through were empty , the huts were searched , but nothing was found , soon the punic army became frighteningly isolated
the eye was weeping , the mouth crying , and the teeth seemed only to want something to bite
mains puer robustus ’ , says hobbes
listen , maître pierre , remember that you owe her your life
the devout , prostrate outside , were let into the enclosure
tunis belonged to him ; but the city was no more than a pile of smoking rubble
the elders nodded approval and murmured :
thought gringoire , that rather shakes my conviction
there ’ s witchcraft behind that , said a sinister voice in the crowd
his belt bristled with so many darts that it made a bulge in his full cloak secured round his brow by a leather thong
when he felt her touch upon him , quasimodo trembled in every limb
he passed by the same places , his head drooping , without speaking , without weeping , almost without breathing
sometimes flocks of birds passed by at full speed , in the open blue sky , in the freedom of the air
it was evident that fleur-de-lys saw much more clearly than her mother through the captain ’ s cold and abstracted behaviour
i am not one for rushing headlong into those clouds which break out in rumbles of sedition
it was only because he had so many reasons for keeping on good terms with doctor coictier , louis xi ’ s all-powerful physician , that he had received him thus accompanied
two scullions at number livres !
what are we coming to , said jehanne , if that ’ s the way they are making children nowadays ?
so the barbarians set themselves up on the plain just as they liked , those who were disciplined in regular troops , and the others by nations or as the fancy took them
peoples , still undecided , hesitated no longer
the other skeleton , which held the first in close embrace , was that of a man
it seems so , la bechaigne
he noticed then that he was lying pretty well in the middle of the gutter
the magnificent art produced by the vandals was killed by the academies
they had it up to the waist
at that moment she vaguely remembered hearing something about a captain mixed up in the trial of this witch
she was alone again , musing on the singular words of this almost monstrous creature , and struck by the sound of his voice , so raucous and yet so gentle
the noise increased , and suddenly the furious trumpeting of the elephants broke out as if battle was starting again
some of them stayed with the camels ; the others resumed their march
behind grills of metal or reeds the veiled women silently watched the barbarians go by
father , she asked , who are they going to hang there ?
the carthaginians had put soldiers on the aqueduct ; they began to hurl stones , shot , beams of wood
as you say , gringoire answered
her mother had sewn and embroidered them herself , she had put into it all her needleworking skills and enough spangles for a holy virgin ’ s robe
beauty can do anything ,
and those sheep behind him ?
saying which , he turned his back on the blind man and continued on his way ; but the blind man began to lengthen his stride at the same time as he did , and then up came the cripple , up came the legless man , in great haste and with a great din from the wooden bowl holding the stump of the one and from the crutches supporting the other , clattering over the stones
( for gringoire was making enough noise for four people )
the one who pulls the ugliest face , by general acclamation , is elected pope
that is the immemorial way things go
finally he came down with dignified steps and shut himself up in his tent
a child innocently blowing on the flickering fuse of a petard , and having it explode in his face , could not have been more appalled than mahiette at the effect produced by this name abruptly cast into sister gudule ’ s cell
louis xi died the following year , in august number
the recluse ’ s voice still pursued her
in the middle rose the armoured helepolis ; and from time to time huge fragments fell off it like stones from some crumbling pyramid
but no lamp and no airhole
how debauchery , so delightful in prospect , turns out ugly and sour in retrospect !
she remembered seeing them before ; but their beards were longer , their faces still blacker , their voices harsher
a second , and a third ugly face followed , then another and yet another , and each time there was renewed laughter and delighted stamping of feet
he had not offered holocausts ; he had not been able to purify his troops ; he had even refused to take augurs with him ; and scandal provoked by this sacrilege increased the violence of repressed hatred , the rage of disappointed hopes
to keep his states he needed a balance between the two peoples ; he therefore had an interest in the safety of the canaanites , and declared himself their friend as he sent them oxen and , nebels of pure wheat
the door was right beside him
did he give way to such outbursts of insatiable hate , or was it a refinement of perfidy ?
yielding to his need to rehabilitate himself and take his revenge , he listed all he had done for the mercenaries ’ cause
he ’ s the one who pushed us into it , and now he just walks out on us in the middle of the job !
they had been entrusted by their parents into the discreet and venerable keeping of madame aloïse de gondelaurier , widow of a former master of the king ’ s crossbowmen , now living a retired life with her only daughter in her house on the place du parvis notre-dame in paris
then from the gulf to the lagoon , from the isthmus to the lighthouse , in every street , on every house and every temple , there came a single shout ; it sometimes stopped , then started again ; the buildings trembled with it ; carthage was as if convulsed in a spasm of titanic joy and boundless hope
that rather amazes me
quasimodo , wrapped in darkness , watched them pass by under the torch-lit porch
first , to the east , in the part of the town still named after the marsh , marais , where camulogenus bogged down caesar , there was a dense collection of palaces
it divided into unequal masses
the nameless man replied
the others , whose hatred was not so old , did not know what to decide
there were howls of anger : he was beheaded
during the night he made all his men pass along the outer side of the lagoon , along the seashore , and entered carthage
suddenly she broke off , trembled in every limb , and cried out in a voice which came from her innermost depths : my daughter !
as wicked as he ’ s ugly , put in another
it was there , in the middle of their fief , that claude ’ s parents resided
she fell , her head back , over the back of the throne – pale , stiff , her lips open – and her unbound hair hung to the ground
but the inhabitants and the barbarians were dead , in hiding or in flight
that reminds me , you had a funny way of making a special little pout ; do you still do it ?
one night he plunged into the gulf and swam for three hours without pausing for breath
he gently struck them with the tip of his foot and listened attentively like a musician tuning a lyre
why had he ravaged the tribes ?
the sight of the zaïmph had shattered salammbo
during the commotion the cardinal , no less put out than gringoire , had taken himself off with all his suite on the pretext of having business and vespers to attend to , without the crowd , which had been so excited by his arrival , taking the slightest notice of his departure
cried the chiefs of the syssitia
they sacked his tent
after a few steps he found himself on the pont saint-michel
the gypsy girl made her little pout of impatience , and pressed the neck of the gourd to quasimodo ’ s tusky mouth
hey there , my friend , was that sore on your leg so uncomfortable that you moved it to your arm ?
their voices were drowned in the tumult of the others ; spendius added :
it is my turn , now !
and they were still expecting the army from tunis !
my dear , dame aloïise exclaimed solemnly , your parents never fished up that name for you from the baptismal font
gringoire said to the archdeacon
as long as i had money , i feasted , led a wild and merry life
once the criminal had set foot in an asylum he was sacred , but he had to take care not to leave it
in fact he saw her spring quickly up the ladder
no blood on her !
as there was no door to the walled-up cell of the tour-roland , someone had carved over the window in romanesque capital letters the two words : tu , ora [ you , pray ]
the strong avoided each other , and the fearful sought out the brave , who were however unable to save them
she said to the priest
talking about mistakes , said the king ’ s attorney , i was just studying the doorway down below before i came up ; is your reverence quite sure that it is the opening of the book of physics that is represented on the side facing the hôtel-dieu , and that among those seven naked figures at the feet of our lady the one with wings on his heels is mercury ?
the square was in total darkness , and a double crimson curtain which had dropped back behind the door just as it closed again hardly let through on to the balcony any light from inside the apartment
while the archdeacon faced death so horribly a few feet away , quasimodo wept and looked at the grève
your majesty has seen that the truand did not recognize me
meanwhile it fixed on phoebus two staring eyes full of that vague luminosity given off at night by the pupils of a cat ’ s eyes
they contained themselves , however
but seizing an iron bar he began to unseal the floor slabs like a madman
you have blood on your nails !
carthage did not have the strength to be angry with him
as food for crews amounts to minas a month for a trireme… ’
she still came forward , dressed in her long trailing white robe , with her eyes fixed on the veil
further on she could see , between the towers , the barbarians ’ movements ; on days when the siege was interrupted she could even distinguish their occupations
i hold in my hand ezekiel ’ s magic hammer !
the mourning weeds may wear out and fade ; the heart stays black
he said to our poet , so you do want to be a truand ?
at last the two armies moved
they were stripped ; and these naked white bodies stayed on the sand , in the sun
then they cried that they had been deceived : if their pay had not come within three days they would go and collect it themselves in carthage
despairing of getting anything out of the recluse , tristan l ’ hermite turned his back on her and with inexpressible anxiety she saw him walk slowly towards his horse
she threw the zaïmph round her waist , swiftly collected her veils , her cloak , her scarf
the shouts of laughter , the tramping of these thousands of feet , set up a great noise and clamour
but because of his popularity the elders loathed him ; for they feared the risk of a master , and out of terror for monarchy tried to attenuate what remained of one or might bring it back
the unarmed man falls at my knees and calls me lord and great king !
this hail of shot , arrows , and fire passed over the front ranks and described an arc which fell down behind the walls
i was alive right down to the tip of the dagger !
dawn was rising , staining the talc sheets set in the walls wine-red
corne de bceuf , what a joke !
they demolished their own battlements ; bits of wall collapsed in a great cloud of dust ; and the catapults on the terrace fired at one another so that their stones collided and burst into thousands of fragments which poured down on the combatants
in all that vast horizon , with such diverse aspects all around him , his contemplation was concentrated on a single point
that ’ s a very abrupt change of subject
but the procession took a long time to come : it walked very slowly
the reader has no doubt already guessed that this unexpected resistance which had exasperated the truands came from quasimodo
it was known by three names , explaining its history , purpose , and architecture : the maison du dauphin , because charles v as dauphin had lived there ; the marchandise , because it served as the town hall ; the maison-aux-piliers ( domus ad pilorid ) , because of a series of large pillars supporting its three storeys
all was not over for quasimodo
he was the only spectator of his play left
yes , she said so quietly that the word was covered by her breathing
her head , which had been raised in joy , sank back on her chest
it was a fearsome struggle
others stayed leaning , chin in hand , more rigid than sphinxes , gazing with their great dark eyes at the ascending army
gringoire and his philosophy were missing from this spectacle
he stood there grave and motionless , absorbed by one look and one thought
she had heard someone sigh like that before
with each step he discovered some new disaster , one more proof of the thing he had forbidden himself to learn
for one of the basic differences between towns then and now is that today it is the façades which look on to squares and streets , while then it was the gables
sirens , said liénarde
the two horses , going at walking pace , kept slipping and so they arrived at the theveste gate
paris which had , so to speak , no lighting at that period , offered to the eye a confused collection of dark masses , broken here and there by the whitish curve of the seine
the houses on the bridge don ’ t look all that fine , because they are so crammed with people , but all the same that doesn ’ t stop the butchers living there , and they are rich men married to fine women as clean as could be
unless , perhaps , you are tanit ?
they made their way back to carthage beset with all kinds of fear
what does that mean ?
anyhow , i avoided women
i tell you there is !
they took off their armour so that the sword point should go in more quickly
yes , sister , the king of tunis answered , unless you take him for a husband
this large basin , round as a cup , was lined with quays on which were built shelters for the boats
it was a spacious tent with a pole in the middle
hamilcar revelled in the sight of his vengeance ; but suddenly he gave a start
finally they demanded a reunion to celebrate one of their victories and the peace party gave way , taking their revenge on hamilcar who had given so much support to war
all sorts of sounds drifted and scattered all over the city , now half awake
distraught , she said : let me go , or i ’ ll spit in your face !
i ’ m sorry about that , the provost replied
thanks to this thicket of pikes and arquebuses , the parvis was empty
they put up screens of rush hurdles as protection against missiles
the savagery of the people was excited in advance
at the entrance , between a stele of gold and one of emerald , stood a cone made of stone ; as mâtho passed by it , he kissed his right hand
but they understood one another wonderfully well
the only door that nature had left open for him on to the outer world had suddenly been closed for ever
at the same time loud applause could be heard from outside
she approached the victim with her graceful step
what are you saying , wicked man , trying to break my heart ?
light , gold , the same thing
meanwhile the university ’ s official bookseller , maître andry musnier , bent to whisper in the ear of the furrier of the king ’ s wardrobe , maître gilles lecornu
hamilcar , in a red mantle like the priests of moloch , stood beside the baal , before the toe of his right foot
there the town could find everything that a good town like paris needs : a chapel , for prayer ; a courtroom , for hearing pleas , and , if necessary , putting the king ’ s men in their place ; and in the loft , an arsenal full of artillery
she added : what is this place you are in then ?
the power of poetry over the people is great ; i ’ ll bring them back
exhausted , she fell back against the wall , and then the fear of death took hold of her
on top of that a very cold wind was blowing , and january is not the month for a successful attempt at getting mankind to take this new step forward
the gypsy said in a low voice
those who were nearest to the defile turned back ; but the passage had entirely disappeared
the slave , who had not eaten for a long time , pounced on it ; his tears fell into the dishes
only the sea was free
sometimes in the middle of a field a mosaic would be displayed , all that remained of some vanished country house ; and the olive trees , which were leafless , looked from a distance like big thorn bushes
if i succeed i ’ ll see the blue spark fly from the head of the nail
he is trying to lie , the coward !
soon the ever-increasing uproar round the building and the anxious bleating of her goat , which had already woken up , roused her from sleep
the petit-bourbon , my dear !
it was now completely dark
at that moment clopin came back and cried in a thunderous voice : midnight !
what do you mean ?
others again stuck iron hooks into the riders ’ necks and pulled them off
when he had spent a while looking for a suitable place for haranguing the soldiers , he made a sign : the litter stopped and hanno , supported by two slaves , put his feet shakily to the ground
i will soon be a hundred , he said , i have seen agathocles ; i have seen regulus and the roman eagles marching over the crops in punic fields !
salammbo wound it round her waist , under her arms , between her knees ; then taking it by the jaw she brought its little triangular mouth to the edge of her teeth , and half closing her eyes , bent back under the moon ’ s rays
said gringoire , there ’ s the logis barbeau over there
they were slaughtered at the edge of a pit
such is notre-dame de paris , a pointed-arch building , but with its earliest pillars going down into that romanesque zone where the doorway of saint-denis and the nave of saint-germain-des-prés are deeply plunged
no doubt it was awful that he too had been mistaken , that he should have believed that impossible thing , that he should have believed a dagger thrust to have come from someone who would have given her life a thousand times over for him
her horizon was again ominous
from the time of françois ii the architectural form of the building becomes steadily less evident and makes the geometrical form stand out like the bone-structure of someone emaciated through illness
there was only one window , a long lancet latticed with brass wire and iron bars , further obscured by fine glass painted with the arms of the king and queen , each pane costing number sols
the huts ’ roofs were falling in , and inside could be seen fragments of pottery , tatters of clothing , all kinds of utensils and unrecognizable broken objects
nevertheless the simplicity , the sweetness of the faces , the gaiety of the attitudes and the draperies , and that indefinable charm which is blended with all the defects , make these figurines very cheerful and delicate , even perhaps too much so—don ’ t you find that entertaining ?
then he stayed with staring eyes and gasping as though he were going to die
mâtho tried to speak
they wheeled round in the air with loud , harsh cries , in a huge cloud which continually rolled round
captain phoebus de châteaupers ( for it is he at whom the reader has been looking since the beginning of this chapter ) slowly approached the balcony
in one of the heaps which made uneven humps over the plain something vaguer than a ghost rose up
still , i don ’ t say anything
he understood her nod
the conical roofs of the heptagonal temples , the stairs , terraces , ramparts , gradually took shape against the pale dawn ; and all round the carthaginian peninsula pulsed a girdle of white foam while the emerald-coloured sea seemed frozen in the cool of the morning
suddenly , looking down between the broad scales of slate which cover the perpendicular wall of the bell tower up to a certain height , he saw in the square a girl in a strange outfit stop , spread out on the ground a carpet on which a little goat came to stand , and a group of onlookers collecting all around
damn it all , go on !
the mendacious captain knew very well that an affair of honour always enhances a man ’ s standing in a woman ’ s eyes
quasimodo placed himself in front of the priest , flexed the muscles of his athletic fists and looked at the assailants , grinding his teeth like an angry tiger
he was known to be deaf , it was as though he were also blind
he told himself that perhaps there would be no need to take it to acquire its virtue
the whole band repeated the pun in thunderous tones , with frenzied clapping
she abruptly drew away from the adventurous officer , and casting a glance at her naked bosom and shoulders , red with confusion and speechless with shame , she crossed her lovely arms over her breast to cover it
go on , burn it !
announcing échevins and burgomasters was one thing , but a hosier … that was hard
may the devil take him !
that pane of glass beyond , that transparent obstacle , that wall of crystal harder than bronze separating all philosophical systems from the truth , how would you get past that ?
her last glimmer of hope was extinguished
a pity you haven ’ t any hair—hallo !
the soldiers admired his skill and carried out his orders
when at last , after lengthy contemplation of the university , you turned towards the right bank , towards the town , the sight before you suddenly changed in character
what is this witch ’ s name ?
between theocratic architecture and this there is the difference between a sacred and a vulgar tongue , between a hieroglyph and art , between solomon and phidias
maître pierrat torterue is the roughest groom who ever curried a rogue , and i can tell you , if that gives you any pleasure , that your bell-ringer ’ s hide got a proper tanning at his hands
it was known only that she had a secluded life of pious exercises
before you kill me , i beg you , tell me if he is still alive !
perhaps they won ’ t hang me
suddenly i hear a cry from upstairs , and something falling on the floor , and the window opening
write , clerk , said charmolue
the good lord , who is the master , didn ’ t give her back to me for nothing !
but though he was in harbour , and precisely because he was in harbour , he never recalled without disquiet the diverse fortunes of his political life , so long filled with danger and toil
the supernatural goat followed her
spendius walked continually behind him , and they returned without the dagger being drawn
the king began walking slowly round the little structure , carefully examining it , while maître olivier , who was following him , read out the memorandum aloud :
the whole lot came straight from lower egypt to reims by way of poland
however , calm had gradually been restored , the student was quiet , the beggar was counting coins in his hat , and the play once more had the upper hand
an arrow , stopped by the feathers , stuck into his ear with its great gold ring , and a streak of blood ran on to his shoulder from his tiara
then they demanded tents : they were given tents
he felt his heart beating
and turning towards the gallows with a sign of his head : gone !
they are all obliged to go out up the chimney
you know what servius says : nullus enim locus sine genio est [ for there is no place without its spirit ]
to all spendius ’ comforting talk he repeated the same words ; their nights were passed in such groaning and exhortation
the nobleman standing by the king was reading out to him some kind of lengthy memorandum to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively
but soon , resuming his stance , he crossed his arms and looked at the ground
have you ever seen him panting upon the great bell on some high whitsun holiday ?
it is a curse !
the time had come to take quasimodo back
one winter—it was that same year , number—when the two women hadn ’ t a stick of wood to burn , and it was very cold , it gave la chantefleurie such a pretty colour that men would call out to her : paquette !
come , my poor barber , things will even out
bellows burst out through the clashing of cymbals
how many systems clash in confusion as they buzz against that eternal window pane !
there was movement in the shadows
he stopped between the legs of the bronze colossus
you ’ ll let me polish your spurs , brush your tunic , dust your riding boots
quasimodo climbed the tower stairs for the sake of climbing them , to find out why the priest was climbing them
his face showed no sign of shame or blushes
no , nothing , said liénarde
sire , i beseech your majesty to hear me
a faggot for this monkey face !
from the depths of the narrowest alleys , the darkest hovels , emerged pale figures , viperish looking men , gnashing their teeth
all had now arrived and gringoire breathed again
the attention of the people , like the sun , pursued its revolution ; starting at one end of the hall , after pausing for a time in the middle , it was now at the other end
hanno was angry at their impassivity
besides , they did not think themselves guilty ; the feast had been forgotten
i will bring her back !
after all , what was a wretched dancer of the public squares to these girls of noble family ?
and he ceaselessly extolled the virtue of light
the student was yelping
the legal profession takes all the wheat for itself and leaves only the chaff for the other learned professions
come on , you big lion !
taanach returned to her side , and when she had arranged two candelabras , whose lights burned in crystal balls filled with water , she stained the inside of salammbo ’ s hands with lausonia , put vermilion on her cheeks , and antimony on her eyelids , and drew out her eyebrows with a mixture of gum , musk , ebony , and squashed flies ’ feet
she had endured everything up till then
one word , a single word , in heaven ’ s name !
the freshness slowly spread ; they breathed in the damp air , flinging their limbs about , and in this joyful intoxication an immense feeling of hope surged up
he went deaf from ringing the bells
do you think i am worried about carthage ?
then he rose , leaned on his interlocutor ’ s arm , signed to the sort of mute standing in front of the door to precede him , to the two flemings to follow , and left the room
negroes who had never seen lobsters tore their faces on the red claws
alone in his tent
then as the rosy sun spread wider , the tall houses tilted on the slopes of the ground grew taller and massed together like a flock of black goats coming down from the mountains
note that ; i think that ’ s what brought misfortune on paquette
suddenly a gaul , near to spendius , rushed over the tables and ran straight at gisco , at whom he threateningly brandished two naked swords
our readers may have observed that some time must have elapsed between the moment when jupiter went behind the curtain and that when the author of the new morality play so abruptly revealed himself to the simple admiration of gisquette and liénarde
next hamilcar sent out a galley armed with a catapult at each end
mâtho , behind her , stamped his foot
tell me , you devil ’ s own jehan , have you any money left ?
the genius scattered among the masses , kept down everywhere under the feudal system as though by a testudo of bronze shields , finding no other outlet than architecture , emerged through that art , and its iliads took the form of cathedrals
aren ’ t you eating , mademoiselle esmeralda ?
i will provide you with elephants ( my forests are full of them ) , wine , oil , barley , dates , pitch and sulphur for sieges , , foot soldiers , and , horses
the soldiers with much laughter slipped fingers through the gills and brought them to the tables
paris was born , as we all know , on that old island of the city shaped like a cradle
one evening the gypsy girl had disappeared , and had given no signs of life since then
i ’ m seeing stars and fiery spears
your spite is reserved for me alone !
it was the terror and confusion of the man of the sanctuary dazzled by the light shining from gutenberg ’ s press
or any who want to be , joannes put in
look at that little column
people from the country , riding donkeys or running on foot , pale , breathless , panic-stricken , arrived in the city
yet the place maubert is big enough !
they cooked bits on embers , on their swordpoints ; they sprinkled them with dust and quarrelled over the best morsels
and what am i then ?
the whole town slept
do be quiet , my dear liénarde , said her neighbour , pretty , fresh-faced , and a brave sight in her best clothes
he was too far away
with difficulty they pulled his bleeding hand free from the mother ’ s teeth
the priest , beside himself , pounced for it , but the girl was quicker
they were paralysed by a sort of stupor , or ebbed back , and shouts of triumph from afar seemed to drive them along like wrecks in a storm
the girl , staring vacantly at the ceiling , bent backwards , trembling and palpitating beneath that kiss
he burnt the ruins , left not a single tree or blade of grass ; the children and invalids who were encountered were tortured ; he gave his soldiers women to rape before they were slaughtered ; the most attractive were thrown into his litter , for his appalling illness made him burn with urgent desires , which he satisfied with all the frenzy of desperation
what were you going to do in this damnable sedition ?
the bailiff of the palais was a kind of amphibious magistrate , a sort of bat in the judicial order , a cross between rat and bird , judge and soldier
how , said the king , do you go about making a revolt ?
then the slave talked to her about her father
three cheers for pleasure !
to you , louis de beaumont , bishop of paris , counsellor in the court of parliament , i , clopin trouillefou , king of tunis , grand cœsre , prince of argot , bishop of fools , say : our sister , wrongly convicted of magic , has taken refuge in your church ; you owe her asylum and safekeeping ; now the court of parliament intends to take her thence , with your consent ; with the result that she would be hanged tomorrow in the grève were god and the truands not present
yes , she said
but they turned to the right ; they were fleeing
the aerial creature whose shape could be vaguely discerned through the vibrating wings seemed to you chimerical , imaginary , impossible to touch , impossible to see
as they came nearer the ground , the two jets of liquid lead spread out into showers of spray , like water spurting from the countless holes of a watering can
it was much worse than it had been shortly before
the walls were sprinkled with countless fleurs-de-lys
wait , i ’ ll show you
my soul , my life , my body , my person , all is yours , captain
they had extraordinarily dilated pupils with great black rings round their eyes , extending to the bottom of their ears ; their bluish noses stuck out between their hollow cheeks , split with deep creases ; the skin on their bodies , too big for their muscles , was covered with slate-coloured dust ; their lips stuck to their yellow teeth ; they gave off a putrid smell , like open graves , living sepulchres
look at you now , all empty , wrinkled , and limp !
cried fair-haired gaillefontaine , straightening her swan-like neck and smiling bitterly , i see that messieurs the archers of the king ’ s ordinance are easily set alight by beautiful gypsy eyes
i ought not to despise but hate you
so this is the man , she mused , the terrible man who makes carthage tremble !
then they felt alone , despite their large numbers ; and the great city sleeping beneath them , in the darkness , suddenly made them afraid , with its accumulation of stairways , its tall , black houses and its vague gods even fiercer than its people
suddenly a man of mean appearance leaped up at hanno ’ s feet , snatched a trumpet from a herald , blew it , and spendius ( for it was he ) announced that he was going to say something important
i ’ ll find expedients for you—suppose we asked the king for a pardon ?
gringoire jumped like someone touched on an open wound
if he had not been deaf , as the murmur of slumbering paris died away , he would have heard more and more distinctly , from within the gondelaurier mansion , the sound of revelry , laughter , and music
let ’ s hurry , damoiselle mahiette , said the youngest of the three , who was also the fattest , to the provincial woman
this man , because of the elevation , looked no bigger than a dwarf
sicily , where we used to find so many slaves , is now closed to us !
of somewhat vulgar tastes
but when they had come up to the first storey the crampon fell back each time that they threw it ; to discover some crevice they had to walk along the edge of the cornice ; with each row of arches they found it narrower
spendius ’ stratagem did not at first succeed as he had hoped
like that little marcandier from judaea beside you , and whom i hope one day to see nailed to a counter like the counterfeit coin he is !
let ’ s go right away
their heads blocked the feeble light in the cell , without the wretched being thus deprived apparently taking any notice of them
he must therefore be completely satiated
the man ’ s like a stone
but the dark deprived him of his most fearful weapon : his ugliness
cried bérangère , jumping for joy
when they brought you in , i was there ; when they interrogated you , i was there
throw it on the ground , she said
as for those who had been made pliable through fear of torture , the enemy ’ s weapons had been distributed among them ; and now they presented themselves to the vanquished , not so much to win them over as out of pride and curiosity
they drew further and further away , and he arrived all alone at the second enclosure at the foot of the acropolis
they loathed the legion for this reason , and some had been known to risk their lives for the inconceivable pleasure of drinking from these cups
bits of material hung here and there on the bushes ; under the lemon trees rotting flowers made a yellow pile of muck
those who found the siege most tedious , especially the gauls , did not hesitate to leave the walls to try to meet him
holy virgin , look at all those girls !
all four wore robes half yellow and half white , differing only in the kind of material of which they were made ; the first was of gold and silver brocade , the second silk , the third wool , the fourth coarse linen
they were face to face at javelin range
i have seen all the horrors of battle and the sea choked with the wreckage of our fleets !
it had however eight iron-bound wheels , and since the morning it had been going forward like this , slowly , like one mountain piled on another
the priest , in a flash , had become cold and calm again
the girl was flushed , confused , quivering with emotion
hamilcar did not turn back
as we have just said , the palace quarter , of which we have tried to give the reader some idea , while pointing out only the highlights , filled the angle formed by charles v ’ s wall meeting the seine to the east
one of his libyans offered himself
suddenly he caught the bell ’ s frenzy ; his eye became extraordinary ; he waited for the bourdon to come past , like a spider waiting for a fly , and suddenly flung himself headlong upon it
the women truands showed no great interest in the offer
now , the slightest contact with that devil ’ s gypsy would put you in thrall to satan
he ’ s making a meal of it !
abbas beati martini , scilicet rex franciae , est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam prebendam quam habet sanctus venantius et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii
his eyes flashed with lust and rage
the crowd howled with joy , and applauded
if i were to lose you ! —chantefleurie got up all of a sudden and began running round reims crying : to the gypsy camp !
i don ’ t know , she said
yes , gringoire went on , talking to himself and touching his nose with his index finger to indicate deep thought
from all this quasimodo could make out only fair hands clasped together , smiles mingled with tears , the girl ’ s eyes raised to the stars , the captain ’ s eyes lowered ardently on her
it is the mother of revolutions
others sat on their haunches , staring in front of them ; or , half hidden in their thick manes , slept curled up in a ball , and all looked replete , tired , bored
and putting their weight on the stake mâtho had brought , they managed to dislodge one of the slabs
gringoire buried his face in his hands , not being fortunate enough to have a cloak to hide his head like timanthes ’ agamemnon
the ruins came down through the breaches in the walls on to the middle of the plain ; right in the background , between the shores of the gulf , the elephants ’ corpses , driven by the breeze , collided , like an archipelago of black rocks floating on the water
the guards of the legion , in their gold-scaled armour , formed the first line , with their great horses without manes , or hair , or ears , and with a silver horn in the middle of their foreheads to make them look like rhinoceros
only the flemings and the rabble remained
yes , the gypsy answered
tristan clapped him on the shoulder : you make a good cat !
and in terror buried her head between her shoulders , like a sheep waiting for the butcher ’ s club to fall
they tied the goat ’ s hooves together , and the king ’ s attorney resumed the thread of his eloquence
in tents and houses there was the same desire , the same anguish ; everyone was wondering what was delaying hamilcar
the egyptians banged away on their balafos and african tambourines
after running at full pelt for some time , with no idea where he was going , rushing round many a street corner , stepping over many a gutter , crossing many an alley , cul-de-sac , crossroads , seeking an escape route and passage through all the twists and turns of the old cobbles of the halles , exploring in his panic what the beautiful latin of the charters calls tota via , cheminum et viaria [ every road , pathway , and thoroughfare ] , our poet suddenly stopped , first because he was out of breath , then because he was pulled up short by a dilemma which had just occurred to him
for many of them it was the first time they had seen a mercenary camp
at clypea he had received three thousand gauls
whether he be called brahmin , magus , or pope , in the hindu , egyptian , or romanesque masonry it is always the priest , nothing but the priest , of whom one is aware
they began to run , set fire to others
louis xi went back to his seat , and said with a smile : ah !
you see , my little girl , the recluse went on , punctuating each word with kisses , you see , i ’ ll love you dearly
he felt very near the underground spirits
i thought they were the six white geese sainte-geneviève pays the town for the fief of roogny
when he entered , his father and mother had been dead since the day before
this sight of carthage annoyed the barbarians
to think that they had come close to hanging the bailiff ’ s sergeants !
the saxon architect was just completing the first pillars of the nave when the pointed arch arriving from the crusades installed itself victoriously on those broad romanesque capitals designed only for round arches
next day he opened the pits where he kept corn ; his intendants gave it to the people
his illness , eating away his lips and nostrils , had scooped out a large hole in his face ; from ten paces one could see right down his throat , and he knew himself to be so hideous that , like a woman , he wore a veil over his head
pearls of different colours fell down in large bunches from her ears on to her shoulders and down to her elbows
she put her head out of the window and quickly withdrew it
flamingo wings , mounted on black-coral branches , lay about among the purple cushions and tortoiseshell combs , cedar-wood boxes , ivory spatulas
another crowd was growing around our old friend the valiant king of tunis , who was armed to the teeth
hamilcar continued on foot , alone , for the meetings of the elders were , in extraordinary circumstances , always secret , and members made their way there mysteriously
continuing his advance mâtho thought he could make out punic standards , for unmoving horses ’ heads appeared in the air , fixed to the top of stacked shafts that were invisible ; and further off he heard a great hubbub , a noise of song and clinking cups
she was very beautiful at that moment
all communication had been severed between his dramatic knot and its resolution
once the needs of worship have been met and ensured , architecture can do whatever it chooses
a ladder had indeed been set up by the permanent gibbet , and the executioner was busy adjusting the chains , rusted by the rain
the officer , who was as handsome as a noble lord , comes down again with me
it was not empty
this royal barber had three names
white slime ran from their nostrils , and their limbs were stiff , as if the night chill had frozen them all
he murmured to himself , she must be cold by now !
and seeing the profound stillness of his whole body , barely stirring at intervals in an involuntary shudder , like a tree in the breeze , his elbows , set more stiffly than the marble on which they rested , the petrified smile contorting his features , one would have said that nothing was still alive in claude frollo except his eyes
i have done nothing to you
for after my death i shall see those great men , pythagoras among philosophers , hecataeus among historians , homer among poets , olympus among musicians
you would be done for
this was , you may remember , one of the goat ’ s most charming talents
rome scorned the mercenaries ’ overtures in sardinia , and would not even recognize as subjects the inhabitants of utica
i have found my child !
they had settled at the foot of the walls , with their baggage , their servants , their whole satrap retinue and they were making merry in their handsome pearl-edged tents , while all that remained of the mercenary camp was a heap of ruins on the plain
here it is an insurrection
how rents are going up !
you have done well , iddibal !
in the gypsy ’ s place , on the same carpet whose pattern of arabesques had been concealed a moment before by the capricious movements of her dance , all the archdeacon could see was the man in red and yellow who , to earn a few coins in his turn , was parading round the circle , elbows on hips , head thrown back , face scarlet , neck extended , with a chair held between his teeth
i have worked in the quarries and i have drunk massic wine in a boat that i owned , under a golden canopy , like a ptolemy
you had that much effrontery , maître pierre ?
after all , the poor girl only sulked at him with great reluctance
we want to know why you did not come back to carthage ?
the king violently interrupted
how did you manage , then , to escape from quasimodo ’ s clutches ?
to have taken her from me like that , you can never have watched me with her , when i warmed her at my fire and she was so happy , when she smiled at me as she sucked at my breast , when i walked her little feet all the way up my chest to my lips !
the good wax candle has gone out , and all i have left is a nasty tallow wick smoking in my nose
there , in the middle of the pavement—it was noon—bright sunshine—a creature was dancing
he walked on a few steps , and noticed the two screech-owls , that is dom claude and maître jacques charmolue , absorbed in contemplation before a sculpture in the portal
with hanno ’ s camp turned upside down , he had come back at them
she crushed her nails against the precious stones on her breast
how much is it , this roof of yours ?
he said between his teeth
amid the dust the heavy millstones turned , that is two superimposed porphry cones , the upper one , with a funnel on it , turning on the lower , driven by stout bars
they fell upon the slaves ; an appalling clamour went up and a dizzy whirlwind of destruction swept over the drunken army
and spendius , appearing terrified in the gap in the wall between the clay pots , cried diese words :
and next year , if god and our lady ( here he raised his hat ) grant us life , we ’ ll be drinking our tisane out of a pewter mug !
his assistants , two square-faced gnomes , in leather aprons and canvas breeches , were moving the ironware about on the coals
it is a transitional building
look at all those fine black copes !
after much talking the following measures were decided on and immediately put into execution
they began drinking again
it was like a mountain ; and on this heap of armour and corpses a monstrous elephant known as baal ’ s wrath ’ , caught by the leg between the chains , stayed bellowing until evening with an arrow in its eye
the recluse did not want to deny everything , for fear of arousing suspicion , and replied in a tone of surly sincerity : if you ’ re talking about a tall girl they gave me to hold just now , i can tell you that she bit me and i let her go
it was this : since he could not escape the pope of fools , jehan fourbault ’ s banners , may bundles , squibs , and petards , he would boldly plunge into the very heart of the festivities and go to the place de grève
mâtho went away , making a sign to the others to hurry
in fact salammbo did not speak of gisco ; because , as words have an effective power of their own , curses reported against someone might turn against the speaker ; and she said nothing of her desire to murder mâtho , for fear of being blamed for not giving way to it
maître coppenole is putting me right
that crowd had been led to expect some sort of execution from the presence of the four sergeants posted since nine in the morning at each corner of the pillory , doubtless not a hanging , but a whipping , an ear-cropping , in a word , something ; that crowd had swollen so rapidly that the four sergeants , hemmed in too closely , had more than once needed to compress ’ it , as the expression then went , by laying about them with their cudgels and backing their horses into it
to love a woman !
musnier , we ’ ll burn your books
then , addressing the archdeacon : you have a nimble touch , dom claude , and hippocrates is hardly more of a problem to you than a nut to a monkey
if i move she comes forward ; when i stop , she rests !
hideous weapons had inflicted complicated wounds
every town in the middle ages , and up until louis xii every town in france , had its places of asylum
clopin trouillefou had placed himself at the apex , with the duke of egypt , our friend jehan , and the boldest of the sabouleux
swear on your mother ’ s womb , the archdeacon repeated violently , that you haven ’ t laid so much as a finger on that creature
suppose there ’ s a sudden puff of wind ?
all eyes turned to the tribune reserved for the flemish envoys
his unwonted clemency was a by no means unimportant sign of it
the jealous girl interrupted him : who ’ s that ?
meanwhile a man in white was walking on the edge of the rampart , impassible and indifferent to the death around him
as soon as they were alone , autharitus spoke up for the comrades who had been sacrificed , and zarxas said to spendius :
they came to the camp , without collars or belts , in open sandals , like neighbours
phoebus ’ life , that meant everything
the barbarians stopped laughing and for a long time were seized by amazement
some people ate a lot , regained strength and were no longer depressed
the truands are blocking the streets
amid all the noise , at the far end of the tavern , on the seat inside the fireplace , a philosopher was meditating , his feet in the ashes and his eyes on the burning brands
mahiette seemed to awaken from her thoughts
at that moment the fresh , joyous sound of children ’ s voices passed by the cell
crossing the macar some mules were lost
dearest brother , i ’ d like to settle down to a better life
no thief has ever stolen
at the bedside a dagger lay on a cypress wood table ; the sight of this shining blade excited her with an urge for blood
at last , when he was sure , quite sure , that she was no longer there , that it was finished , that someone had stolen her from him , he went back slowly up the tower staircase , that staircase he had scaled in such excitement and triumph the day he had rescued her
gringoire started looking for fresh solutions
one had its ears horribly split , another a large wound on the knee , the third had had its trunk cut off
at court he was politely called olivier le daim ; among the people , olivier the devil
some distance behind them two men dressed in the flemish cut conversed in low tones , and they were not so hidden in the shadows that anyone who had been present at the performance of gringoire ’ s mystery play could have failed to recognize in them two of the principal flemish envoys , guillaume rym , the shrewd pensionary from ghent , and jacques coppenole , the popular hosier
the pikes were not strong enough and broke , the elephants swept through the phalanxes like boars through tufts of grass ; they uprooted the stakes of the camp with their trunks , went through it from end to end , knocking over the tents with their chests : all the barbarians had fled
i don ’ t understand , said gervaise
imagine what an effect that would have !
by the way , jehan , don ’ t you have any money left ?
and whatever he tries , do not call out !
carthage , megara , her house , her room , and the countryside she had come through swirled in her memory in a series of tumultuous but clear images
they fly in one direction and look towards another—the priest thus passed by above quasimodo without seeing him
there are invariably two naves crossing at right angles , the upper end of which is rounded into an apse and forms the choir ; there are always side aisles for processions inside the church , for chapels , a kind of lateral ambulatory into which the main nave empties through the bays
i reckon that it ’ s rare , right enough , that anyone should stay as fiercely pure as a nun in the midst of those gypsy girls who are so easily tamed
what are the names of your two friends ?
they followed him , others came up , and like him they all went in the direction of the mappalia
if you have some mumbo-jumbo to get through first , over there in that mortar there is a very fine stone god the father which we stole from saint-pierre-aux-bœeufs
seen thus , in the half-light cast over the square by the truands ’ few torches , the long beam carried by this mass of men running to hurl it against the church made one think of some monstrous beast with hundreds of feet charging head down against the giant of stone
one half formed the earth , the other the firmament
the art has become just skin and bones
i swear by my share of paradise that i won ’ t come near you without your leave and permission ; but give me some supper
in silence he freed his feet from the folds of his robe , picked up his lantern and began slowly climbing the steps up to the door ; he opened the door once more and went out
the last to arrive , standing against the trees , looked at the low tables , half hidden under crimson coverings , and waited their turn
they broke the sycamore chest ; it was three quarters empty
and then there ’ s the character of the inhabitants
but he may very well be right , this madman , doctor jacques !
monsieur the king ’ s attorney in ecclesiastical courts , said the president , the court is ready to hear your requisitions
they are having a warm ; fine way to enjoy yourself !
thus , having no other way of declaring itself but in stone masonry , thought rushed to it from every direction
it ’ s quite true then , i shall never see her again , not even in heaven !
to love her with all the frenzy in one ’ s soul , to feel that for the least of her smiles one would give one ’ s blood , one ’ s entrails , reputation , salvation , immortality and eternity , this life and the next ; to regret not being a king , emperor , archangel , god , so that she could have a greater slave at her feet ; to embrace her night and day in dreams and thoughts ; and see her in love with a soldier ’ s uniform !
captain phoebus , you ’ re a lucky soldier !
jehan restrained him : shame on you , captain phoebus de châteaupers !
the gypsy gave him a few little taps on the mouth with her pretty hand , playfully childish , graceful , and gay
moreover , it was not only his body which seemed to have been fashioned to fit the cathedral , but his mind too
a rotten little montaigu cappette , wasn ’ t it ?
then grief , heavier than the humiliation of defeat , overwhelmed the barbarians
may the baals be favourable to you !
as for the celtic stratum , no more examples of it were being found then , even when wells were dug
a good fellow for a bishop !
you declaim like a professional orator !
there are other advantages
when he stood up again he was full of serene boldness , invulnerable to pity or fear , and as his breast was suffocating he went up to the top of the tower overlooking carthage
gold is the sun , to make gold is to be god
what will it be ?
a thousand livres parisis for a mass !
chantefleurie had pounced on the little shoe , all that remained to her of everything she had loved
she slept as lightly and restlessly as a bird ; the least thing woke her up
behind the acropolis , where the land was red earth , the mappalian way , with tombs on either side , ran straight from the shore to the catacombs ; then came large dwellings spaced out amid gardens , and this third quarter , megara , the new town , went up to the edge of the cliff , where stood a giant lighthouse which blazed out every night
we needed it , said the syssitia chiefs
sister , said the archdeacon , do you really hate gypsy women then ?
the captain was the first to break the silence : upon my word , he said in his fearlessly fatuous voice , what a charming creature she is !
for so long she had grown unaccustomed to sleep
attached to this little shoe was a scrap of parchment on which was written this verse :
how can she be saved ?
it had been ended despite all his efforts , so that , despairing of carthage , he had handed over control of the mercenaries to gisco
at last he dared to touch him with a finger , lightly , on the elbow
then , beyond the regions directly subject to carthage , extended the allies who paid only a modest tribute ; behind the allies roamed the nomads , who could always be let loose on them
some waited for the grapples from the doors to touch the wall before launching out ; in the middle of the upper platform the skeins of the balistae were wound up , and the great shaft of the catapult was lowered
the suffete had concentrated his men in a circular mass , in such a way as to offer equal resistance all round
he had come to terms with the din , and was determined to go on to the end , not abandoning the hope of regaining the people ’ s attention
he tires out pierrat torterue himself , and his hands are bigger than mine
four mansions almost touching , the hôtels de jouy , de sens , de barbeau , and the logis de la reine were mirrored in the seine , their slate roofs punctuated by slender turrets
her hair had been curled to resemble a cloud
it ’ s the sower , isn ’ t it ? —eh , master , what ’ s on your mind ?
the barbarians ’ eyes fixed on it as they shivered all over , and tears came to their eyes
it was something unintelligible and awful :
to measure a toe is to measure the giant
i have tried everything !
he was an austere , solemn , morose priest ; having the cure of souls ; monsieur the archdeacon of josas , second acolyte to the bishop , having charge of the two deaneries of montlhéry and châteaufort and a hundred and seventy-four rural incumbents
it was not that his single eye was any less able to see at long range , but there was a mass of soldiers preventing him from making out everything
then the women laughed and cried , the crowd stamped with enthusiasm , for at that moment quasimodo truly had a beauty of his own
he took sole charge of war , government , and finances ; and to forestall any accusations he asked for hanno to inspect his accounts
at last the prisoner broke the silence : who are you ?
the slave interrupted him :
that gloomy , unhappy face beamed radiantly
hitherto all he had known was humiliation , contempt for his condition , disgust for his person
here we have a keep , a tower with an alarm bell , cannon , citizens , soldiers
perhaps she is deaf , oudarde said with a sigh
i am your friend
the unhappy girl would in any case be woken soon enough to die
but hamilcar took the path by the mill , from which emanated a mournful dirge
every morning he left the truands ’ quarters , usually with the gypsy girl , he helped her collect the harvest of targes and petits-blancs at the street crossings ; every evening he went home with her under the same roof , let her bolt herself in her little room , and slept the sleep of the just
give me back my child !
he snatched the papers from the other man ’ s hands
nothing could be seen of his body , neither his face nor his hands
he came up the stairs : then he stopped at the edge of the terrace and crossed his arms
first he refused men of sedentary occupation , then those whose bellies were too fat or who looked cowardly , and he admitted men in disgrace , the scum of malqua , sons of barbarians , freedmen
he made off in that direction
jehan , master of the battlefield , pressed on in triumph : i ’ d do it too , even if i am an archdeacon ’ s brother !
she had flung the poor gypsy , half dead , into the corner of the cellar , and had resumed her position at the window , both hands resting on the corner of the ledge like a pair of talons
the tourangeau , despite the intelligence in his eyes , had seemed for some time now no longer able to understand dom claude
a few moments after passing the bell cage , he came upon a little landing , inserted into a recess in the side wall , and under the vault a low , pointed door
the ground sloped upwards , they were assailed by javelins , and turned back – and with mighty blows of their tusks and hooves they ripped , smothered , flattened the carthaginians
he gave an order in an undertone to two archers who took the truand away
in the ancestral chamber there is a golden ingot under each stone ; an underground passage leads to their graves
what did i tell you sister , that young cleric , monsieur claude frollo , is a sorcerer
at last they stopped
the mellifluous instruments of the hymns sound out , the angels ’ sweetest melodies , the wondrous song of songs ! ]
went on the soldier , flattered by the provost ’ s praise , the breaks in the iron are quite fresh !
however , some sort of noise must have issued from it , even if it were no more than the tramp of feet
the poet went on
and on the left , that big black cat ?
it caused a diversion
a crude job for a philosopher
by the cave of hadrumetum and the kingdom of the spirits !
we ’ ll go on together to spell out the façades of saint-côme , sainte-geneviève-des-ardents , saint-martin and saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie … ’
they were sent oxen , sheep , guineafowl , dried fruit , and lupins , with smoked mackerel , that excellent mackerel exported by carthage to every seaport
well spoken , cried the people ; let ’ s start the hanging with his sergeants
his name was spendius
i just love the apricot tree carved over the door with its amusing play on words : á l ’ abri-cotier
their incomplete or multiple limbs were swollen by their terrible exertions
: bailiffs , échevins , burgomasters ; burgomasters , échevins , bailiffs ; all stiff , formal , starchy in their best velvet and damask , wearing cramignole caps of black velvet with huge tassels of cyprus gold thread ; good flemish heads after all , dignified , severe features belonging to the same family as that which rembrandt brings out so powerfully and gravely against the black background of the night watch ’ ; personages every one of whom bore graven on his brow that maximilian of austria had been right , as his manifesto ran : to have full confidence in their prudence , valour , experience , loyalty , and integrity ’
she went a little red , and lowered her eyes ; her long , sweeping lashes made shadows on her cheeks
they went forward to these uncertain rays
she shook her head again , stared at oudarde and answered : water
then she saw her captain frown , and a beautiful girl , who was leaning back on him , look at him with scornful lip and angry eye , then phoebus spoke some words , which did not reach her , and the two of them hurriedly disappeared behind the balcony window , which closed behind them
he had both arms round her
this breath contracted , creating desire and the sky , and from desire and the sky emerged primal matter
in speaking of this man had not schahabarim said that she must conquer moloch ?
the captain stood leaning on the back of her chair , and in a low voice she grumbled at him affectionately :
dom claude paled again , and the student casually went on : and that word underneath , incised with the same hand , ’ aναγνεία means impurity
pierre , my friend , said the king of tunis , what the devil are you thinking about ?
which has translated it ?
meanwhile the dancer stayed motionless in the doorway
behind these palaces , there ran in every direction , now fenced , stockaded , crenellated like a citadel , now veiled with tall trees like a charterhouse , the vast , multi-form enclosure of the marvellous hôtel de saint-pol , where the king of france could provide superb accommodation for twenty-two princes of the rank of the dauphin or the duke of burgundy , with their servants and suites , not to mention great nobles , and the emperor when he came to look at paris , and the lions , who had their separate residence within the royal residence
messieurs the flemings , come and see this
your eminence , the abbot replied , is wasting his courtesies on these flemish snouts
the king only loosens his hold when the people snatch
that ’ s half as much again as in the time of the paclet brothers , but it is not a lot
the insults were atrocious , obscene , with ironic encouragement and imprecations ; and as his present pain was not enough for them , they promised him still more fearful pains for eternity
what am i saying ?
as behind owls do songbirds in full cry
others who had daubed themselves ceremoniously with vermilion looked like coral statues
it ’ s a dream that you ’ re telling me
in this enclosed space , in this sombre setting of hangings and panelling , she was incomparably more beautiful and radiant than in a public square
the word hermetics ’ suddenly brought to his mind the image of archdeacon claude frollo
do you not see her wandering round him like a woman in love running after a man in a field ?
the cloister was abandoned , the canons had fled to the bishop ’ s palace to pray there together ; the garth was empty , with a few terrified servants hiding in dark corners
the star was louis xi ’ s candle
all were placed facing the sun , towards moloch the devourer , stretched on the ground or supine , with the ones condemned to be flogged , standing against the trees , with two men by them , one counting the strokes , the other striking
may the great devil neptune stick his fork in me if i don ’ t make you the happiest creature in the world
when it had come up close to him , it stopped , and stayed as motionless as the statue of cardinal bertrand
with the death of michelangelo what did this wretched architecture do , living on as a spectre and shade of its former self ?
spendius , with , men , went to the bridge built over the macar , three miles from utica ; its corners were fortified with four huge towers provided with catapults
twelve men from greek colonies embarked at annaba on a numidian sloop
hamilcar accepted their challenge
you will rest later , won ’ t you ?
a few moments later our poet found himself in a little gothic vaulted room , nicely private and warm , sitting in front of a table which looked as if it would be only too pleased to borrow one or two things from a meatsafe hanging nearby , with the prospect of a decent bed , and alone in the company of a pretty girl
here ’ s some-thing else , added maître jacques , rummaging again in his satchel , we found in marc cenaine ’ s house
as soon as they caught sight of someone they invited him to their entertainments
he could hear his cassock , which had caught on the rainspout , tearing and coming unstitched every time he gave a jerk
go to the devil !
ceraunites engendered by thunder twinkled near chalcedonies , which are a cure for poisons
oudarde in her turn , more gently and tenderly , said : sister !
above the towers , far up in the sky , faint bird-cries could be heard
so quasimodo was in charge of the peal at notre-dame
upon my soul , the rector of the university should have done the same
proud of having forced the republic to yield , the mercenaries thought that they were at last going to return home with their blood-money in the hood of their cloaks
they ought at least to give us a morris dance or some other mummery !
i don ’ t know , monsieur , the young man replied
she seemed to fill it with her spirit
those who , like ourselves , never pass by the place de grève without sparing a look of pity and sympathy for that poor turret , squeezed between two ramshackle louis xiv buildings , can easily reconstruct in their mind ’ s eye the whole collection of buildings to which it belonged and thus recreate in its entirety the old gothic place of the fifteenth century
you stand accused before us : primo , of causing nocturnal disturbance ; secundo , of indecent assault against the person of a loose woman , in praejudicium meretricis [ to the detriment of a harlot ] ; tertio , of rebellious and disloyal conduct towards the archers of the ordinance of the king , our master
here a bell rang out , there a hammer , over there the complex clatter of a moving cart
maître olivier , seeing the king in generous mood and thinking the moment favourable , came up in his turn : sire … ’
what is to be done ? … how can i get back into carthage ?
bronze plates , silver ingots , and iron bars alternated with pigs of tin brought from the cassiterides by way of the dark sea ; gums from the lands of the negroes spilled out of their palm-bark sacks ; and gold-dust , heaped up in wineskins , leaked imperceptibly through seams worn with age
he was leaning against the corner of his fiancée ’ s house , swearing like a heathen
the man in black opened it with a key he had
i can assure you that she ’ ll have lots of men in love with her , that one !
the idea of some attempt against the gypsy girl returned to his mind
how happy you would be in great cool rooms , lying on flowers , with lyres playing , clowns , and women !
he had solicited an edict from the bishop expressly forbidding gypsy women to dance and play their tambourines in the square before the cathedral , and at the same time had been going through the official ’ s musty archives to collect cases of sorcerers and sorceresses condemned to the flames or the rope for complicity in witchcraft with he-goats , sows , or she-goats
all attempts to find her had been in vain
no king , no god !
he had only one thought left now , and that was to kneel down in front of her whom he had just saved for the second time
just then one of the braids of the salamander ’ s ’ hair came undone , and a small brass coin that was attached to it rolled on to the ground
then i glimpsed the demon ’ s snare , and i doubted no more that you had come from hell and had come thence for my damnation
what are you talking about , neighbour ?
he gave my place in the norman nation to little ascanio falzaspada , who belongs to the province of bourges , since he ’ s italian
you tell the enemy which route they are to follow , as you did with those gauls in sicily , or you put them ashore in the middle of the sea
at times he looked up into the air , as people do when they are bored
it was the first time
it was the clibanarii ’ s armour , the punic camp ; then they distinguished other , more numerous , lights round about , because the mercenary armies , now merged , extended over a wide area
human speech for him always meant mockery or curses
they accused and threatened their leaders
the waves of this human flood , constantly spreading , broke against the corners of houses projecting here and there like headlands into the irregular basin formed by the place
you don ’ t know what unhappiness is
and above all the other voices that of joannes de molendino could be heard , cutting through the hubbub like the fife in a charivari at nîmes : start right away !
and the chased ironwork which made biscornette lose heart ?
he cried , furiously seizing gringoire by the arm ; could you have been so forsaken by god as to lay hands on that girl ?
in so doing you will be performing a most noble act for our lady , and i swear to you that i am very frightened at the idea of being hanged
as you see , master
where are you going ?
but , although it was the season for sowing and ploughing , the fields were , as far as the eye could see , empty as the desert
at most she would sometimes catch a glimpse of the bell-ringer ’ s face at the top of a tower , mournfully gazing at her
his distorted voice sounded like a roar ; he said :
his hand , however , moved quite freely ; he held his nose and resigned himself
every time autharitus considered gisco he was seized with fury at the memory of his insult : he would have killed him but for the vow he had made to narr ’ havas
that was not much of a supper
everything was ready , and still hamilcar did not move
she smelled of honey , pepper , incense , roses , and something else as well
he stopped , then , in front of the statue as usual
the garden , long neglected , had grown profusely ; colocynths climbed up into the branches of cassias , asclepiads dotted the rose beds , all kinds of vegetation had entwined and formed arbours ; and the sun ’ s rays , slanting down , brought out here and there , as in a wood , the shadow of a leaf on the ground
it ’ s as densely packed as a cabbage heart !
they remembered that several of them who had left for carthage had never returned ; no doubt they had been killed
soon this resource ran out
girl , night and day , yes , night and day , does that deserve no pity ?
while you were away i had pits dug in the arsenals , the gardens , everywhere !
quasimodo regarded it all with an air of indifference and surprise
you admit to seeing the ram that beelzebub makes appear in the clouds to convene the sabbath , and is seen only by sorcerers ?
and , carried by all these shoulders gripping his sides , he repeated : what are you going to do ?
he had gone about it with such enthusiasm that the inscription eduensis episcopus [ bishop of autun ] had been almost obliterated
boy , let me be first to go up
when thinking about phoebus left her time , the gypsy sometimes thought of quasimodo
the orgy was becoming more and more flemish
meanwhile the archdeacon , who had left charmolue in utter amazement , had come close to them , stopping a short way off , and was observing the two of them without their being aware of him , so deeply absorbed were they in contemplation of the wallet
a sign from claude , and the idea of pleasing him , would have been enough to make quasimodo throw himself off the top of the towers of notre-dame
we have all been beaten !
the others were whispering
he went to open the door
a single word of forgiveness !
it was no easy matter that day to gain admission to the great hall , though at the time it was reputed to be the largest enclosed and covered space in the world
it took the thing as a whole , and honoured , venerated , if need be sanctified , but did not analyse the suffering involved and felt no particular pity for it
there she met the romans ; and like a man set upon by murderers , she felt death all around
they pulled him ; for all his weight , his feet did not touch the ground
they took away the officer , poor young man !
some of the neighbours even affirmed that they had once seen , through a grating , archdeacon claude digging , stirring , and turning over the earth in the two cellars whose buttresses had been daubed with countless verses and hieroglyphs by nicolas flamel himself
half dead she turned to the window , and saw the sachette ’ s wild face through the bars
he began striding up towards the place de grève , holding her by the hand
she thought about the possibility of a popular insurrection to snatch her from her refuge
i shall fall to the pavement if you don ’ t take pity on me , pity on yourself
but disenchanted though gringoire was , the overall scene was not without glamour and magic : the bonfire cast a harsh red glare which flickered brightly over the circle of faces in the crowd , over the girl ’ s brown forehead , and on the square behind cast a pale reflection mingled with their wavering shadows , on one side upon the black , wrinkled old façade of the maison-aux-piliers , on the other on the stone arms of the gibbet
how irreverent you are !
his breast was indeed lacerated as though by a tiger ’ s claw , and in his side was a large wound which had not properly closed
her father had not wanted her to enter the college of priestesses , nor even that she should learn anything about the tanit of the people
i cried out so much that the good lord heard me
mademoiselle will testify to the fact that we acted with all possible gentleness
why were his remaining hairs already grey ?
none of your formulas gives any real results , whereas alchemy has made discoveries
she is not like any other daughter of men !
or was it that marie had a rival in the heart of the bell-ringer of notre-dame , and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were being neglected for something more beautiful and worthy of love ?
there was a clutter of tongs , pincers , great ploughshares inside the furnace , all reddening together on the coals
if only i could just once , once more , once only , put this shoe on her pretty little pink foot , i would die , good virgin , blessing you ! —ah !
a man in black with a handsome officer
they waved their scarves from a distance ; then they came in the dark to talk to the soldiers through the gap in the wall , and the grand council learned one morning that they had all run off
it was an oryngian stallion , fed on balls of flour , which bent its knees for its master to mount
the priest was rolling on the ground in the water and banging his skull on the corners of the stone steps
from the peal in the slender spire over the crossing to the great bell over the doorway , he was fond of them all
yes , the priest answered
the syssitia , claiming their right to wreckage , demanded the younger ones to sell ; and the new-carthaginians married lacedaemonians , who were blonde
they amused themselves looking at the pillory , a very simple sort of monument consisting of a cube of masonry some ten feet high , hollow inside
the actors went bravely on
a thought had occurred to him as he was lacing up his boots , but at first he rejected it ; however , it came again , and he put his waistcoat on back to front , an obvious sign of violent inner struggle
in the distance a few lanterns glided over the harbour , and there were lights in the temple of khamon
for a long time they looked at each other in silence , and salammbo ’ s eyes , buried in her long draperies , looked out like twin stars through a break in a cloud
thus the old suffete larded his address with proverbs and apologias , nodding his head the while to invite some approval
the seine was lost to sight under the bridges , the bridges under their houses
the reader may not have forgotten that a moment before catching sight of the truands ’ nocturnal band , quasimodo , inspecting paris from the top of his bell tower , had seen only one light still shining , twinkling like a star in a window of the top storey of a tall , gloomy building , near the porte saint-antoine
salammbo , calm as a statue , did not seem to understand
some terrible astrological predictions had originated in that laboratory
on that day , just as he arrived outside the low door of the cubby-hole and was inserting in the lock the intricate little key which he always carried with him in the wallet hanging by his side , the sound of tambourine and castanets reached his ear
at that there filed in , two by two , with a gravity strongly contrasting with the exuberant ecclesiastical suite of charles de bourbon , maximilian of austria ’ s ambassadors , led by the reverend father in god jehan , abbot of saint-bertin , chancellor of the golden fleece , and jacques de goy , sieur dauby , high bailiff of ghent
however , such was his respect for the priest , his gratitude , devotion , love for the man were so deeply rooted in his heart that they held out even at that moment against the claws of jealousy and despair
but the carthaginians , placed in the middle of the syntagmata , and who had suffered less , were stamping with impatience at the vengeance that was eluding them ; they were already going off in pursuit of the mercenaries ; hamilcar appeared
one had to be content with these four rubble walls and two sandstone backplates , and a mean stone gibbet , meagre and bare , beside it
if the lions sleeping in the courtyard had come in roaring the clamour would not have been more appalling
it was priestly dread in the face of a new agent : printing
allow me to rejoin my company , because it ’ s without its captain
the sachette once more hugged her daughter
the germanies are so great and powerful that it is scarcely credible !
phoebus , the sunshine , noonday , fresh air , dancing to applause , sweet prattling of love with the officer , all that indeed still ran through her mind , sometimes as a golden , lilting vision , sometimes as a shapeless nightmare ; but now it was just a vague , horrible struggle fading into the darkness , or distant music playing up there above ground , no longer audible at the depths to which the unfortunate girl had fallen
the reply bore so little relevance to the question that the uncontrollable laughter began again , and messire robert cried out , red with fury : are you scoffing at me too , you arrant rogue ?
whereas if they continued their efforts they would obtain at once liberty , vengeance and money !
gringoire replied in such passionate tones that he himself was astonished to hear himself speak like that
the streamers fastened to the horns of his helmet flapped in the wind behind him , and he had put his oval shield under his left thigh
the priest stayed undecided
you are taking orpheus for hermes
the man in black stood up
her eyes remained cast down
he wanted the veil , not that he had any confidence in its virtues ( spendius only believed in the oracle ) , but he was convinced that when the carthaginians found they had been deprived of it they would fall into deep despondency
as he spoke , the old man had raised his head
you have come to consult me , maître , concerning which science ?
no one would have dared to do anything against me !
the priest saw him , and with his fingertip tested the point of a dagger which he kept hidden on his breast
next day they slaughtered all the mules , about forty of them
fine so far , observed the philosopher
meanwhile he forgot about drinking
so he was there , her friend , protector , support , refuge , her phoebus !
and the head farrier number livres !
his savings are like the spleen , which swells up as all the other parts grow lean
so she was la chantefleurie
they were all their own masters
they went to the right and left , hampered by the tent ropes , the wandering animals and the tripods where food was cooking
so saying the priest took her by the arm
suddenly he felt a hand laid gravely on his shoulder
a groom of the bedchamber at number livres a year !
it all comes back to me
suddenly zarxas , now handsome and vigorous , leaped like an acrobat on his friends ’ shoulders and cried :
as for the elephants , they were not sufficiently trained
—her voice , her face , her movements , her whole person bore the heart-rending expression of a shipwrecked mariner making distress signals to the ship merrily passing in the distance in a ray of sunshine on the horizon
there is his honour gilles lecornu , brother of maître jacques lecornu , provost of the king ’ s household , son of maître mahiet lecornu , head porter of the bois de vincennes , all burghers of paris , all married from father to son !
they sat down on the tombs , out of breath , then began again
at that time nothing could be simpler than putting an animal on trial for sorcery
go away , if you are afraid !
he thus became more and more learned and at the same time , as a natural consequence , more and more rigid as a priest , more and more gloomy as a man
but all this touching , the smell of the perfumes and the fasting exhausted her
he answered with a look colder and heavier than an executioner ’ s axe ; the slave , fainting , fell to the dust at his feet
hanno proposed some atrocious and impracticable measures , such as promising a large sum for each barbarian head , or burning their camp with boats and machines
now , upon how many heads had the presidency , the chancellorship , and the mastership fallen since robert d ’ estouteville had held the provostship of paris !
then , in a solemn voice : master , in tanit ’ s sanctuary there is a mysterious veil , fallen from the heavens , which covers the goddess
you can ’ t go out
you love me , don ’ t you ?
the glass globes on the temple roofs sparkled here and there like large diamonds
yes , kill him , you must !
only yesterday , for a bath attendant and four kitchen hands , i paid more than i used to for a pair of elephants !
spendius , surrounded by greeks , hid in one of the crevasses ; as he was afraid , he spread the rumour of his death
this episode had seriously distracted the audience , and a good number of spectators , with robin poussepain and all the clerks in the lead , merrily applauded the weird duet improvised in the middle of the prologue by the student with his strident voice and the beggar with his imperturbable chant
suddenly great plumes were raised , and to the rhythm of flutes a fearful song broke out
at the end of that gallery is a door , which is only ever closed on the latch ; with this ladder i climb up there , and i ’ m inside the church
it ’ s a friend of mine
a man was dragging over the pavement something white to which something black was attached
god knows where and when maître florian would have made landfall , thus launched in full sail on the high seas of eloquence , if the low door at the back had not suddenly opened to admit monsieur the provost in person
it seemed to them as though they had just gone into a church for tenebrae in holy week
the formidable quasimodo had plunged down from his litter , and women averted their gaze so that they would not see him tear the archdeacon to pieces
he had learned to read in latin
then they spent the night eating , and the remains of the meat was burned with the skin , bones , horns , and nails
on the pavement at intervals crouched enormous lions , like sphinxes , living symbols of the devouring sun
they were all laughing in his face
that ’ s going a bit far
for the burghers of paris know that it is not enough in every contingency to pray or to plead for the freedoms of the city , and always have in reserve in a loft of the hôtel de ville some good old rusty arquebus
no doubt about it , put in a third , she ’ s a witch who has dealings with the bogey-monk so as to rob officers
the dossier of the case was for him like a dog to a blind man
all that only increased the catcalls and jeers
at last hamilcar set up crosses for any who might talk of surrender ; even the women were organized into bands
seen from a bird ’ s-eye view , then , these three townships of city , university , and town each appeared as an inextricable web of weirdly tangled streets
the captain exclaimed , with a roar of laughter
then they discovered on a camel a great bronze tub : it was the suffete ’ s , for bathing in during the journey ; for he had taken all sorts of precautions , even taking along in cages weasels from hecatompylus which were burned alive to make his drink
from time to time he would stop in front of the clouded casement with its lead lattice , look , listen , and stamp his feet
he had himself transported to the arsenal , to the lighthouse , to the treasury in the temples : his great litter could be constantly seen , swaying from step to step , as it went up the stairs of the acropolis
a city was a collection of hundreds of lordships which divided it into compartments of every shape and size
you have , acting in complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in the charge , on the night of number march last , murdered and stabbed , in league with the powers of darkness , with the help of charms and practices , a captain of the archers of the king ’ s ordinance , phoebus de châteaupers
they put a lance in salammbo ’ s hands which she offered to narr ’ havas ; their thumbs were tied together with a thong of oxhide , then corn was poured over their heads , and the grains falling round them sounded like hail as they rebounded
when he saw his adversary on guard and ready to lunge : captain phoebus , he said in a tone vibrant with bitterness , you are forgetting your appointment
great bunches of feathers swayed at their corners , and rays of light came from their sharp peaks ending in balls of crystal , gold , silver or copper
you got those great big eyes from me , mademoiselle
its lowest branches disappeared beneath strips of cloth and necklaces that the faithful had hung there
hanno recognized the king of the numidians in the rearguard ; narr ’ havas bowed in greeting , and made a sign that he did not understand
meanwhile calm had been gradually restored
the barbarians were worried ; this proposal of immediate booty made them dream ; they were apprehensive of some treachery , not suspecting a trap in the suffete ’ s boastfulness , and they began to look at each other distrustfully
it suddenly caught sight of the gypsy girl , and jumping over the table and the clerk ’ s head , in two leaps was at her knee
here ’ s a way of getting off for the moment
gringoire wondered rather uneasily
others had sailed on westward for four months without landfall ; but the ships ’ prows became entangled with weeds , on the horizon there was the continuous thunder of waterfalls , blood-coloured mists hid the sun , a breeze laden with scents sent the crews to sleep ; and at the moment they could not say anything , their memory had been so impaired
and the row of dots which followed his mental reticence implied some rather pleasing vague ideas
so you know jupiter ?
a very steep set of rough stone steps , known as the ladder ’ par excellence , led to the upper platform , on which could be seen a horizontal wheel of solid oak
they came back , chasing amid the cries and dust a score or so of men distinguishable by their paler faces
from top to bottom the walls shook with it , and the two sides of the street seemed to mâtho to be coming at him and lifting him off the ground , like two huge arms choking him in the air
i ’ m going somewhere where i can see you without you seeing me
he closed his one eye , let his head drop on to his chest and looked as if he were dead
every mind is a mason
behind them thronged a ragged mob
he suddenly cried amid the expectant calm which had followed the commotion , jupiter , our lady the virgin , you devil ’ s tumblers !
make them all as deaf as i am
the truand looked at the king , swinging his arms with a dazed expression
come along , a little pity , gringoire—be generous in your turn
woe betide you if you approach that woman !
it is the fault of the rich !
with that done , he had been calmly watching , whistling from time to time when a blackbird passed by
and yet between us lie the invisible waters of a limitless ocean !
three men ’ s hearts differently made
at regular intervals stood towers , built by the carthaginians to watch over the tribes
domestic animals , reverting to wildness , ran off at the least sound
the three barbarians , hairy and covered in rags , looked at him without understanding what he was saying
thus , to sum up the points just mentioned , gothic architecture is today disfigured by three kinds of ravage
the ex-slave began to describe the manoeuvres
they told themselves ; tomorrow came and went
at this oath , louis xi ’ s favourite one , someone seemed to be waking up inside the cage , chains scraped noisily across the floor , and a feeble voice was raised , which seemed to come from the grave : sire !
and the rector ’ s stools !
amen ’ said the archdeacon
and when i ’ m old or ugly , phoebus , when i am no longer fit to love you , my lord , you ’ ll still put up with me as a servant
so he went up to the top floor of his house ; then taking from a golden shell hanging from his arm a nail-studded spatula , he opened a small oval room
the barbarians turned in that direction , and as the crowd then drew away , there appeared in their midst , moving as slowly as a phantom , a human being , bent double , thin , completely naked and covered down to his flanks by long hair bristling with dry leaves , dust , and thorns
went on the bald man ’ s voice
olivier , write without delay to monsieur the maréchal de rouault—that discipline is growing slack—that the men-at-arms of the ordinances , the nobles of the ban , the free archers , the swiss are causing endless trouble to the inhabitants—that the soldiers , not satisfied with the property they find in the farmworkers ’ houses , force them , by beating them with staves and spears , to go into town and look for wine , fish , spices and other extravagances—that monsieur the king knows this—that we intend to keep our people from harassment , theft , and pillage—that such is our will , by our lady ! —that furthermore it is not our pleasure that any minstrel , barber , or servant-at-arms should dress like a prince in velvet , silk and gold rings—that such vanities are hateful to god—that we content ourselves , we who are gentlemen , with a doublet of cloth at number sols the paris ell—that messieurs the camp-followers can very well come down to that too—order and command—to monsieur de rouault , our friend—right
he never dreamed of any other espaliers than those of the stained-glass windows always in bloom , any shade but that of the stone foliage , laden with birds , flowering in clumps on the saxon capitals , any mountains but the colossal towers of the church , any ocean but paris murmuring at their feet
do you understand , you rascal ?
he clapped his hand to his mouth to stifle his sobs , and half swooning in his intoxication he let go the halter of his dromedary , which went on with long , regular paces
abdalonim , still prostrate , told him about the barbarians ’ feast he had been unable to avoid carrying out the elders ’ order – besides , salammbo had wanted lavish expenditure to give the soldiers a better reception
as he plunged into the side aisles he saw , behind a cluster of pillars , a reddish gleam
at this point gringoire firmly believed that ever since that morning he had just been in a dream , and that this was a continuation of the same dream
quasimodo was there behind her
the very children were arming themselves , and even the legless cripples , in bard and cuirass , scuttled between the drinkers ’ legs like huge beetles
by my share of paradise , monseigneur , gringoire replied , trembling in every limb , i swear to you that i have never touched her , if that ’ s what is worrying you
there was an immense cry of imprecation , then everything went quiet , and a few unfortunate victims crawled mutilated from under the pile of dead
pour avoir mangé trop d ’ épice ,
at that moment a crowd formed under the plane-trees
after all , on the tribune as on the marble table , it was all the same spectacle : the conflict of husbandry and clergy , of nobility and trade
the barbarian army , on the other hand , had not been able to keep its alignment
in any case , the officer did not hear the unhappy girl calling him
i don ’ t see anyone in the dock
there was a tavern in the lower room , and the rest on the floors above
the wind drove him on to the roof of a house where the unfortunate man ’ s body was first smashed
he looks at you : he ’ s one-eyed
there was another silence , then he continued : what have i done with him , lord ?
what , in the words of jean de troyes , excited all the people of paris ’ on number january was the twofold celebration , combined since time immemorial , of the feast of the epiphany and the feast of fools
it was the pulpit and the manuscript , the spoken and the written word , taking fright at the printed word ; something like the stupefaction of a sparrow seeing the angel legion spreading his six million wings
people at the door tried to get in
fortunately an unexpected incident came to his rescue
his huge gnome ’ s head would lean out over the balustrade , then an enormous stone would fall , then another , then yet another
finally he made a third appearance , on top of the great bell ’ s tower ; from there he seemed to be displaying proudly to the whole town the girl whom he had rescued and his thunderous voice , the voice that was so seldom heard by anyone , and which he himself could never hear , repeated three times , in a frenzy , up into the clouds : asylum !
the poor wretch ’ s melancholy became as incurable and complete as his deformity
but your knees are shaking and you are looking at me like a drunken man !
there the noise of tumult in the air was already fainter
your desire is a sacrilege ; be content with the knowledge you possess !
try now to imagine what capital outlay would be needed to rewrite the book of architecture ; to restore to the earth those teeming thousands of buildings ; to return to the ages when the throng of monuments was such that in the words of an eye-witness : it was as though the world had shaken off its old garments to clothe itself in a white vestment of churches
at one such moment he suddenly saw opening mysteriously the french window to the balcony whose stone balustrade was silhouetted above his head
clopin trouillefou said to the three argoteers , all set to pounce on gringoire like three spiders on a fly
beside it lay an equally dusty pair of bellows , its upper leaf bearing the legend , incrusted in brass letters : spira , spera [ breathe , hope ]
the perfumes flowing from their brows wet their ragged tunics with large drops , and as they leaned with both hands on the tables , which seemed to them to be tossing about like ships at sea , they drunkenly gazed round so that they could devour with their eyes what they could not seize
he went on : one day , i was leaning at the window of my cell… what was i reading ?
the mercenaries were begged not to lose heart ; the brave men of tunis were about to come with large reinforcements
yes , said the student
with my sword and lance , i plough and reap ; i am the master of the house !
as he grew older he had found nothing but hatred around him
people were going , i went
armour , pitchforks , trumpets , bits of wood , iron and bronze , corn , straw , and clothes were scattered amongst the corpses ; here and there some nearly extinguished fire-arrow burned against a heap of baggage ; the ground , in certain places , disappeared beneath shields ; the corpses of horses lay one after another like a chain of little mounds ; one could see legs , sandals , arms , coats of mail and helmeted heads , kept in by their chinstraps and rolling about like balls ; scalps hung on thorns ; in pools of blood disembowelled elephants lay in their death throes , still carrying their towers ; there were sticky things underfoot and muddy patches , though it had not rained
i could kiss , not your feet , you wouldn ’ t want that , but the ground beneath your feet ; why !
he recognized his tent ; and his eyes were riveted on the earth as if hamilcar ’ s daughter had sunk under the ground when she disappeared
you must die , my lovely , or be mine !
and the two students , jehan du moulin and robin poussepain , sang at the top of their voices the popular old refrain :
it was a cripple , short of both a leg and an arm , and so mutilated that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which held him up made him look like a builder ’ s scaffolding on the move
her rather flattened features were as yellow as her tunic
boundless joy swept over them , they embraced each other , wept
she had grown up practising abstinence , fasting , and purifications , always surrounded by solemn and lovely things , her body drenched in perfumes , her soul full of prayers
the suffete had been unable to know anything of this ; the town , in front of him , concealed everything beyond , in the rear ; and the captains dispatched successively to the two generals had not reappeared
quasimodo saw a lot of people go in but he saw no one come out
it was quite simple
what i ’ m telling you explains it all , doesn ’ t it ?
in fact narr ’ havas only ruled over the massylians : and besides , having a custom permitting them to abandon their kings after a defeat , they had collected on the zainus , and then crossed it at hamilcar ’ s first move
and making a derisive bow in the direction of the church : thank you , canons !
the chief of sweet perfumes , as tall and pale as a wax taper , came towards hamilcar to crush a roll of metopion in his hands , while two others rubbed his heels with baccar leaves
i composed a most suitable epithalamium for mademoiselle of flanders and monseigneur the most august dauphin
poor fly who could not have budged the smallest of its stones !
and you torn to pieces in the streets !
from time to time it brought a pittance to the wretched penitent , looked into the hole to see whether the person inside was still alive , did not know his name , hardly knew how many years it had been since he had begun to die , and to a stranger enquiring about the living skeleton rotting in this cellar , the neighbours would simply answer : he ’ s the recluse ’ , or if it were a woman : she ’ s the recluse
he had the ten ambassadors crucified , side by side , on a hillock facing the town
the gypsy , without speaking a word , freed the goat
but they had to be protected against fire from the besieged garrison and first the ditch separating the walls had to be filled in
monsieur , replied the archdeacon , if that is what is in your mind , you would have done better to have saved your breath by not climbing up my stairs
he observed such happiness , such beauty , with bitterness
the bridle rubbing round their armpits had formed purulent scabs such as one sees on a donkey ’ s withers , and the loose black rag that hardly covered their loins hung down at the end , beating against their calves like a long tail
a black cowled robe fell to his feet , a caffardum of the same colour hid his face
you kept me waiting fifteen years , merciful god , but that was so she would be beautiful when you gave her back
with these two quarters , one of mansions , the other of dwelling houses , the third feature of the town ’ s appearance was a long belt of abbeys which ran almost right round it , from east to west , forming behind the ring of fortifications enclosing paris a second inner ring of convents and chapels
clopin shook his head
this reflection decided him , and he plunged resolutely under the little black doorway and began climbing the saint-gilles spiral staircase leading to the upper floors of the tower
great , dark clouds , heavy , ragged , torn , hung like crêpe hammocks from the starry arch of night
i tell you that they were served by le sec , the town sergeant , at the hôtel du petit-bourbon , and that ’ s what misled you
and what we are saying here about the façade must be said of the entire church ; and what we are saying about the cathedral church of paris must be said of all the churches of christendom in the middle ages
i adopt this child , said the priest
but the space was too cramped for him to move his elbows
he looked up with a beseeching eye , and seeing that she was drawing him close to her , his whole face radiated joy and tenderness
pomegranates and colociynths loaded the capitals
i now feel a splendid vocation for that way of life
he tried to banish from his thoughts every form , every symbol and name of the gods , the better to grasp the unchanging spirit hidden behind appearances
we shall not attempt to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose , that horseshoe mouth , that tiny left eye obscured by a shaggy red eyebrow , while the right eye lay completely hidden beneath an enormous wart
we ’ ll be selling off our plate !
quasimodo jerked up as if suddenly roused from sleep
as long as they remain in this state of primal ignorance , moral and intellectual minors , it may be said of them as of the child : that age is without pity
i took you into carthage ; i stole the zaïmph
after a silence he added : and what shall i do with the witch ?
but the priest was neither listening nor looking at any of this
talk of the rector !
he looked for ways to serve her , to humble himself , and he even spread the zaïmph over her legs like an ordinary rug
for the rest , he was appreciated by the chief sapper ’ of europe , he was familiarly involved in louis xi ’ s machinations , and often lent a hand with the king ’ s secret operations
the porphyry basin still contained a little clear water for salammbo ’ s ablutions
they filed past him , by nations , opening out their fingers to show the number of years ; they were marked in turn on the left arm with green paint ; the scribes delved into the gaping chest , and others , with a stylus , punched holes in a sheet of lead
four days later he was at gorza , on top of a pass , when spendius ’ troops appeared below
saint-roch has a doorway that can be compared in magnificence only with saint-thomas d ’ aquin
but for all the beauty it has preserved in ageing , it is hard to repress a sigh , to repress indignation over the countless degradations and mutilations which time and men have simultaneously inflicted on the venerable monument , showing no respect for charlemagne , who laid its first stone , or for philip-augustus , who laid the last
meanwhile she wept torrents , in silence , in darkness , like rainfall at night
the stranger , meanwhile , was still pulling her along as silently and swiftly as ever
as possessor of this fief claude frollo was one of the seven score and one ’ lords claiming feudal dues in paris and its suburbs , and his name could for a long time be seen inscribed in that capacity between the hôtel de tancarville , belonging to maître françois le rez , and the collège de tours , in the cartulary deposited at saint-martin-des-champs
without giving battle , the suffete maintained his advantage ; the barbarians pursued him , while he seemed to be leading them on
behind the cloister there ’ s a little door giving on to the terrain , and from there on to the water
however the machines were not demolishing the rampart
mâtho looked at him with staring eyes
as for the students , they were swearing
in that connection colombe de gaillefontaine , another beautiful fair-skinned blonde in a high-necked blue damask dress , shyly ventured a remark which she addressed to fleur-de-lys in the hope that the handsome captain would reply to it : my dear gondelaurier , have you seen the tapestries in the hôtel de la roche-guyon ?
once the gypsy heard him say to it : oh !
gringoire had apparently taken advantage of the moment of landing to slip away with the goat into the block of houses in the rue grenier-sur-l ’ eau
yesterday he told me : i want to be a soldier
the camp looked like a town , it was so full of people and movement
the suffete soaked his hand in this still warm slime , and rubbed his knees with it ; it had remedial powers
provided the accused was hanged , that was all that was required
girl , you are of bohemian race , given to malefices
it was swimming towards the cité
the effect was like that of a torch brought from broad daylight into the shadows
gringoire fell on his backside , quite appalled with joy
to the wineshop , said jehan
they could clearly make out his costume and his face resting on his hands
and maître pierre gringoire ?
our marriage was a real foris maritagium [ marriage to an outsider ]
in those days people were not keen to attack someone who prayed night and day
they would have liked to exterminate them
you are too kind , master !
carthage recovered from her dejection ; those who were not of canaanite origin were carried away by the passion of the others
the silence of these two men was frightening
from then on , feeling he had a burden to bear , he took life very seriously
then , almost piercing him with his sharp look : no one suspects anything yet ? … ’
they say that he lights up the fires of hell in there and cooks the philosophers ’ stone on a high flame
can these rogues go on with their farce ?
everyone talked , no one listened , and spendius , usually so loquacious , merely nodded his head at every suggestion
the unfortunate girl felt so thoroughly abandoned by god and man that her head fell on her breast like some inert thing with no strength of its own
since the time when he began to live in the pit , they had almost forgotten him ; troubled by old memories , they stood at a distance and did not dare lay hands on him
mâtho had lost his shoulder pieces , his helmet , his breastplate ; he was completely naked , more livid than the dead men , his hair standing straight , with two flecks of foam at the corners of his lips , and his sword wheeled so rapidly that it looked like a halo round him
what ’ s this about a sword-thrust ?
bulges and spaces had appeared along its excessive length ; all the men were panting and breathless from running
he fell silent for a moment , then went on , as though talking to himself , in a loud voice : cain , what have you done with your brother ?
hamilcar ’ s daughter worried endlessly about tanit
he expounded to her the theory of souls coming down to earth , following the same path as the sun along the signs of the zodiac
i couldn ’ t find him , quasimodo said coldly
when she had gone by he started down the stairs again , moving as slowly as he had seen the spectre move , believing himself to be a spectre , haggard , hair standing on end , his hand still holding the extinguished lamp ; and as he went down the spiral stairs , he distinctly heard in his ear a voice laughing and repeating : a spirit passed before my face ; i heard a small breath ; the hair of my flesh stood up
gringoire bit his lips
suddenly he raised his head , his sunken eyes seemed to be full of light , and his voice rang out like a bugle
captains stood all round him
he thanked providence for sending him such a good idea , but as he was about to cross the place du palais to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city , through which wind all those serpentine old sisters , the rues de la barillerie , de la vieille-draperie , de la savaterie , de la juiverie etc , still standing today with their nine-storey houses , he saw the pope of fools ’ procession also leaving the palais and rushing across his path , with loud shouts , bright torchlight , and his , gringoire ’ s , band
it is fate that took you and delivered you up to the dreadful mechanism of the apparatus that i had secretly constructed !
they began to grow deeper , put storey upon storey , climbed one upon another , spurted upwards like any sap under pressure , and each strove to lift its head higher than its neighbours for the sake of a little fresh air
as for the intended function just mentioned , it fulfils it wonderfully ; it is a bourse in france , as it would have been a temple in greece
someone had followed him , and through the darkness , for the lights of the feast were hidden by the corner of the palace , he recognized spendius
there then took place between them a strange dialogue of signs and gestures , for neither spoke
he was beautiful , he , the orphan , the foundling , the reject , he felt august and strong , he looked society in the face , that society from which he had been banished , and in which he was intervening so powerfully , that human justice whose prey he had snatched , all these tigers forced to chew on emptiness , those police agents , those judges , those executioners , all that royal might , which he had just broken , he the lowliest of the low , with the might of god
a physician for him , an executioner for everyone else
was it not louis xiv fulfilling the vow of louis xiii ?
at first sight it could be seen to divide into several peculiarly distinct masses
put them in the van ; mine will march to avenge themselves
it was infinitely surprising , bewildering
lying on his back , arms to his sides and knees together , he looked like a dead man prepared for burial
others said : your life !
but they will come back , mistress
the sex of the two male allegories was clearly indicated to every discerning spectator by their shorter robes and the cramignole ’ caps they wore , while the two female allegories , whose dresses were not so short , wore hoods
but over there , at the far end , whatever can that be , that sort of trestle with four motley puppets on top and four more beneath ?
my poor little hannibal !
he came on , head thrown back , eyes staring and open wide , chanting in a loud voice :
the swan flies both by night and day
what was that tale that archdeacon was making all that fuss about then ?
i have arranged my life … ’
he made the sign of the cross , stood up , put on his hat again and said to tristan : be quick about it , compère
she had never tasted wine , nor eaten meat , nor touched an unclean beast , nor set foot in the house of a dead person
such a death was as good as any other ; and , then , moving his soldiers aside ( for the punic standards hid the horizon from the mercenaries ) he showed them the elephants of narr ’ havas forming a single straight line and brandishing in their trunks great blades , like giants ’ arms holding axes on their heads
it was as if he made the immense building breathe
it was a man ’ s face , austere , calm , sombre
in the middle squatted a woman warming herself at a brushwood fire , the smoke from which escaped through holes in the ceiling
so , despairing of the republic , hamilcar took by force from the tribes all he needed for the war ; grain , oil , wood , animals and men
this group was mainly composed of persons of the fair sex
apparently he stayed in that posture for a long time , no longer thinking , shattered and passive under the demon ’ s hand
my word , captain phoebus , said jehan , taking him by the hand , you swear with admirable vigour
cried the archdeacon just as the tumbler , sweating profusely , passed him with his pyramid of chair and cat , what is maître pierre gringoire doing there ?
they ran to the forward posts , and the suffete ’ s baggage train arrived in the middle of the tents , pushed by the barbarians
their fortunes remained evenly matched ; but both sides were so pent up that they longed for a great battle , instead of these skirmishes , so long as it really was the last
then what do you consider true and certain ?
jehan , my friend , you ’ re drunk , the other said
returning hopes of revenge carried him away
it fell on the roofs , into gardens , and the middle of courtyards , while people were sitting down to a meagre meal with heavy hearts
but who the devil , the poet went on , had nothing better to do than apply for a decree of reintegration ?
indeed , quasimodo , one-eyed , hunchbacked , bow-legged was hardly more than a more or less ’
on these tables glistened pots dripping wine and beer , and round these pots were gathered numerous bacchic countenances , flushed from the fire and the wine
stop right there , you wretches , and let go of that wench !
the lights from the stones and the flame of the lamp were reflected in the great golden shields
the pyre that quasimodo had lit between the towers had gone out
her thoughts awoke too , and came back one by one
autharitus was not afraid of showing himself
claude had entrusted him to the same collège de torchi where he had spent his own early years in study and meditation ; and it grieved him that this sanctuary , once edified by the name of frollo , should now be scandalized by it
and i can ’ t drink too much either
you may only show your face
here ’ s something to pay with
mâtho seized her heels , the golden chain snapped , and as the two ends flew off they struck the canvas like two vipers recoiling
it was a great popular movement , and every great popular movement , whatever its cause and its aim , always releases the spirit of freedom from its final precipitate
the sixth of january number is not , however , a day commemorated by history
all the people in this crowd were themselves struck by it , and began to clap their hands and shout : noël !
he it was who had gone to fetch monsieur de nemours from the bastille saint-antoine and bring him to the halles , and to bring monsieur de saint-pol to the grève , despite the objections and protests of the same , much to the delight of monsieur the provost , who was no friend of monsieur the constable
many mixed foreign practices into their native religion
his friends were taken aside
this is the grève
that ’ s a very odd idea of yours
fleur-de-lys loved him , he was her betrothed , she was alone with him , his former feelings for her had reawakened , not quite as freshly as before , but just as ardently ; after all , it is no great crime to pluck an ear or two before the corn is ripe ; i do not know if such thoughts ran through his mind , but what is certain is that fleur-de-lys was suddenly frightened by the expression in his eyes
she picked up two swords from the ground , balanced them by the tips on her forehead and made them turn in one direction while she turned in the other
châteaupers to the rescue !
they came up against the balustrade , threw themselves back and kept beginning afresh , attracting the crowd to them in the dizziness of this movement full of blood and screams
come here , then , she cried
the sachette is in one of her crazy moods , the people murmured ; and that was as far as it went
he wears fustian breeches
the girl passed her arm through the window , the recluse threw herself upon that hand , fastened her lips to it and stayed , plunged in that kiss , showing no other sign of life than a sob which made her body heave from time to time
cheeks on fire , eyes inflamed , voice hoarse he strode rapidly through the camp ; or sitting on the shore rubbed his great sword with sand
none of his enemies risked any complaint or recrimination
mahiette went on ; as for a child , you are going to see one
[ jonah number : number—all thy billows and thy waves passed over me ]
she repeated her call three times , more loudly each time
those which first excited notice were the bernardins , with its three steeples ; sainte-geneviève , whose square tower , still existing , makes one grieve for the loss of the rest ; the sorbonne , half college , half monastery , of which such an admirable nave survives ; the beautiful quadrilateral cloister of the mathurins ; its neighbour , the cloister of saint-benoît , within whose walls they have had time to botch together a theatre between the seventh and eighth editions of this book ; the cordeliers , with three enormous gables side by side ; the augustins , whose graceful spire was , after the tour de nesle , the second sharp projection on that side of paris , counting from the west
what have they done with you ?
never has more despair been lavished on a more graceful and dainty object
everything was clear , expeditious , explicit
you ’ ll be able to replace mistigri , as an extra knave of clubs in our lord the king ’ s pack of cards
then when the shaft of the catapult rose up , when the pillar of the balista quivered with the shock of the spring , when the stones flew through the air in a steady stream and darts poured down , he leaned right forward and threw his arms in the air , as if to follow them
but salammbo , as though someone had called her , turned her head ; the people , who were watching her , followed the direction of her eyes
at last they agreed , and went back in
the sachet gave off a strong smell of camphor
finally he divided the men into two halves , told the first to wait for him ; then , leading the others , galloping off at an imperious signal , he disappeared into the horizon , towards the mountains
the voice of the same woman who had interrupted the gypsy-girl ’ s dance now interrupted her song
it was at that moment that the recluse caught sight of the gypsy on the pillory through the window of her rat-hole and hurled at her the sinister imprecation : may you be accursed , daughter of egypt !
on this point he was so jealous of his austerity and reserve that when the dame de beaujeu , the king ’ s daughter , came in december number to visit the cloister of notre-dame , he solemnly opposed her admission , reminding the bishop of the statute in the black book , dated st bartholomew ’ s eve number , forbidding access to the cloister to any woman whatsoever , old or young , mistress or chambermaid ’
everything caught the eye at once , the carved gable , the steep roof , the turret suspended at the corner of the walls , the stone pyramid of the eleventh century , the slate obelisk of the fifteenth , the bare , round tower of the castle keep , the square decorated tower of the church , the big , the small , the massive , the airy
quasimodo , far from loosing the horse ’ s bridle , was getting ready to make it turn round
the slaves were armed , the arsenals emptied ; each citizen had his post and service
charmolue asked with his imperturbable benignity
bolder ones came up ; their number increased ; there was soon a crowd
, he would go up the spiral staircase in the bell tower faster than anyone else would have come down it
autharitus , who had only fifty gauls left , was going to kill himself to put an end to it all when , on top of the mountain , he thought he saw a man
bawled robin poussepain and the other clerks perched on the window
the first was a big , slab-faced girl
then he added these mysterious words : alas !
dom claude was jealous of quasimodo !
when will you have your great bell stuck on your head and put a hundred feet under the ground , cursed ringer ?
in her temple or your house , what does it matter ?
the best captains were out there with him !
it was hardly two days since the last cavalcade of that kind , the flemish embassy sent to conclude the marriage of the dauphin and marguerite of flanders , had entered paris , much to the annoyance of the cardinal de bourbon , who , to please the king , had had to put on a welcoming smile for this rustic bunch of flemish burgomasters and treat them , in his hôtel de bourbon , to a very fine morality , satire , and farce ’ , while torrential rain soaked the magnificent tapestries hung at his door
all around they saw an infinite number of beasts , lean , panting , brandishing their claws , and mixed one on top of the other in mysterious and frightening confusion
the stacked pikes and the weapons hanging up dazzled them like mirrors
it contained stables for elephants with stores for their caparisons , their tethers and their food , then other stables for , horses with stores of barley and harness , and barracks for , soldiers with armour and all fighting equipment
but with so many interruptions it was hard to work out what he was there for
then leaning towards the window : paquette !
they had mastiffs , gazelles , or panthers following them
the scorn they felt for these traders made them still braver ; and before spendius had ordered the movement , all had understood and were already executing it
it was clopin trouillefou
we ’ ll have to leave the cake on the window ledge , then
all her past misfortunes came back to her in a flash
men , women , animals , sex , health , sickness , everything seemed to be held in common by these people ; everything went together , mingled , merged , superimposed ; everyone shared in everything
and by the lamp was an old woman spinning and singing in a quavering voice
from the archdeacon he would endure anything , insults , threats , blows , with no murmur of reproach , without complaint
listen—i am nearly at an end
he repulsed her with a vehement gesture , full of pride
i ’ ll go and fetch the sergeants
as for gisquette and liénarde , they had long since deserted
a few liards had rolled into the mud ; the captain , in his enthusiasm , stooped to pick them up
he did not know , he who wore his heart on his sleeve , who observed no other law in the world than the good law of nature , who let his passions flow according to his inclinations , and in whom the lake of violent emotions was always dry , from the many new ways he drained it every morning , he did not know how furiously the sea of human passions seethes and boils when it is denied any outlet , how it piles up , swells , overflows , how it scours the heart , bursts out in inward sobs and silent convulsions , until it has breached its dykes and burst its bed
countless other insults rained down on him , with boos , and imprecations , and roars of laughter , and now and then stones
there was applause for the kedeschim , among these women , with their painted eyelids , symbolizing the hermaphrodite nature of their deity , and , perfumed and robed like the women , these eunuchs resembled them despite their flat chests and narrower hips
as for the the vessels of the sacred legion , they were private property
to be sure , there is material for massive tomes , and often for the universal history of mankind , in these successive weldings of several arts at several levels on the same monument
then , when they were standing up again , hamilcar gave a sign ordering the man with the baldrick to speak
we have just tried to repair for the reader the admirable church of notre-dame de paris
there was a jovial-looking man with a big belly loudly kissing a fleshy , thick-set harlot
just see whether these idlers will move aside !
all of which was quite unknown to this crowd , which marvelled at the courtesies paid by the cardinal to this weedy-looking flemish bailiff
that also proves that one can be a real genius and still lack all understanding of an art which is not one ’ s own
and what more , i ask you ! —it ’ s madness !
by the eight fires of the cabiri !
i should have carried her off !
a splendid decadence , though , for the old gothic genius ; the sun setting behind the gigantic printing press at mainz still for a while sheds its final rays on that hybrid heap of latin arcades and corinthian colonnades
suddenly he struggled again in his chains in renewed desperation , which shook the whole framework supporting him , and breaking the silence which he had obstinately kept so far , he cried in a hoarse , furious voice , more like a bark than a human cry , and rising above the noise of jeers : a drink !
traditions had given birth to symbols beneath which they disappeared like a tree trunk beneath its foliage ; all these symbols , in which mankind put its faith , grew , multiplied , intersected , becoming more and more complex , so that the early monuments were no longer adequate to contain them and overflowed everywhere ; these monuments scarcely still expressed the primitive tradition , which like them was simple , unadorned and rested on the ground
nothing could break the spell put on the audience
gringoire swiftly stooped to pick it up
the splendour of her beauty casts a cloud of light around her ; and i sometimes think that i have never seen her… that she does not exist… and that this is all a dream !
several of them approached , holding palms
first , starting from the tournelle , came the bourg saint-victor , with its single-arched bridge over the bièvre , its abbey , where one could read the epitaph of louis the fat , epitaphium ludovici grossi , and its church with an octagonal steeple , flanked by four eleventh-century turrets ( there is one like it to be seen at étampes ; it has not been pulled down yet ) ; then the bourg saint-marceau , which already then had three churches and a convent
what does the amulet matter to me ?
a moment later the door-hanging was raised and the gypsy girl appeared in the doorway , red-faced , dismayed , out of breath , not daring to take another step
he stopped short : i beg your pardon , ladies !
i believed that it would always depend on me whether to continue or interrupt this case
and as he went down the winding stairs of the palais he grumbled between his teeth : these parisians are a fine lot of asses and boors ; they come to see a mystery play , and don ’ t listen to a word !
the door was made of rotten puncheon staves , which left wide cracks through which his predatory gaze could pass
from now on the field was clear for unbridled folly
he loved them , fondled them , talked to them , understood them
those who had swords held them bare in their hands ; the most defiant stood leaning against the mountain
at length the tavern door opened
jehan clapped his hands : the devil !
you will not come again when i summon you , sitting by the lake side , throwing melon seeds into your mouths !
with no check , no sharing , all the money you want , all the prisoners , all the booty , fifty zerets of land for every enemy corpse !
he interrupted himself violently : no , that ’ s not what i must say
the two girls dropped their eyes
after some moments ’ thought , he invited his two visitors with a sign to be seated , and addressed compère tourangeau
this victim ’ s body was something special for them , endowed with an almost religious splendour
as he explained their chances of success and mâtho ’ s weakness , she seemed to be rejoicing in some extraordinary hope
but most often mâtho , melancholy as an augur , went off at daybreak to roam over the countryside
the old woman was bent double , dressed in rags , a duster over her doddery head , with little slit eyes ; she was wrinkled all over , on hands , face , neck ; her lips sank in under her gums , and all round her mouth she had tufts of white hairs which made her look like a contented cat
we ’ ll help monsieur the bailiff
he was amazed at the small number of children
they were seized with renewed frenzy , and the numidians carried all the others away with them
nothing stirred ; the eternal mountain seemed to them higher every morning
messieurs , you common people of paris !
no one raised his head more proudly and radiantly than i priests consulted me on chastity , learned doctors on doctrine
as to the steps , it is time which has caused them to disappear , by slowly and irresistibly raising the ground level of the city
what do you accuse me of ?
at the end of a long stretch of grassland the lake of hippo-zarytus shone beneath the setting sun
and at the paris boucherie those scaffolds representing the fortress of dieppe !
others , who were watching , began to cry with terror , and the lions , perhaps recalling the feast , stretched out yawning against the edge of the pits
it was , in fact , a rather confused mêleé of all the philosophies , daydreams , wisdoms of mankind
however , an army was needed
but at that moment the archdeacon seemed not to be of this world
the unfortunate girl dropped her head into her hands , and the stranger began rowing furiously towards the bank
every day she sent food into the temples
dom claude gestured impatiently
all had recognized him and held their breath
the joy was delirious !
her body filled the entire ceiling
look , master , see , that group of dark roofs at peculiar angles , there , beneath that heap of low , ragged , dirty , smeared clouds , where the moon looks all squashed and spread out like an egg yolk when the shell is broken—it ’ s a fine mansion
i ’ ve just pulled you out of their hands
between the old church and him there was an instinctive sympathy so profound and magnetic , and material affinities so numerous , that he somehow adhered to it like the tortoise to its shell
others defended themselves to the end ; they were killed from a distance , by stoning , like mad dogs
spendius heard him groaning and talking to himself
in his youth he had studied at the college of mogbeds , at borsippa , near babylon ; then visited samothrace , pessinus , ephesus , thessaly , judaea , the temples of the nabataeans , lost in the sands ; and had followed on foot the course of the nile , from the cataracts to the sea
but so far no one showed himself , and the seven avenues leading from the barriers to the colossus were completely empty
so peace was going to be made , and now it would be final !
you must give it to me
the master-surgeon , to whose house the soldiers of the watch had carried him in the first instance , had feared for his life for a week , and had even told him so in latin
the rope round her neck trailed behind her
he leaned against a tree to prevent himself falling , his heart was beating so fast
they want to bring about your death !
the war , by keeping him far away , had so far prevented him from doing it ; and since they had come back to carthage he had the impression that the inhabitants suspected his scheme
to stratonicles of corinth and three merchants of alexandria , on these letters ( they have come back ) , athenian drachmae and syrian gold talents
in your defence , thought gringoire
hang my pretty djali !
good brother claude , jehan went on , encouraged by that smile , look at the holes in my boots
she looked up and saw a reddish beam shine through the cracks in the kind of door or trap set into the ceiling of the in pace
but he shook his head , and as he saw his accumulated riches he calmed down ; his thoughts , drawn by the perspective of the corridors , spread over other rooms full of rarer treasures
around the room were arranged ebony stools
it was the king on his throne
but very soon it would begin to run away or would vanish into a hole
the inadequacy of preventive measures was sufficient proof that they were deemed impossible
hamilcar is away ; the people loathe the rich ; gisco has no control over the cowards who surround him
at the very moment that i was thinking thus , i saw a goat beside you , a beast from the sabbath , looking at me and laughing
shoot at the windows , cried clopin
beneath it lay a small star , and all around a pale circle
they demanded wine , food , gold
then he would lead the west into the conquest of iberia ; and without asking why he had not come sooner , or challenging any of his lies , he kissed narr ’ havas , striking his chest three times against his own
narr ’ havas made a great gesture of surprise , then fell upon his hands and covered them with kisses
i don ’ t want to see you die !
the gypsy saw the soldiers approaching
why perpetually change your shape ?
they saw quasimodo standing on the parapet of the gallery , holding the student by the feet in one hand and whirling him over the abyss like a sling
the ground became gradually softer , their feet sank into it
then dom claude heard him go off , saying : it ’ s all the same , reason ’ s a fine thing , and my brother the archdeacon is indeed a lucky man to be wise and have money too
after a moment ’ s reflection , while he took temporary shelter beneath the small wicket-gate of the treasurer of the sainte-chapelle ’ s prison , as to where he might decide to spend the night , with all the cobblestones in paris to choose from , he remembered having noticed the week before , in the rue de la savaterie , in front of a parliamentary counsellor ’ s door , a mounting block for mule riders , which , he had thought , might , on occasion , provide an excellent pillow for a beggar or a poet
mâtho barely touched the floor encrusted with gold , mother of pearl , and glass ; and despite its polished surface , it seemed to him that his feet sank in as if he were walking on sand
since they could not be cured , they might as well be delivered from their torments ; and as soon as anyone faltered , all cried that now he was lost and ought to be of use to the others
jehan did not answer
you calling me , child-stealer !
still , one must not hold too much against him : had she not confessed her crime ’ ?
it was a trick , or the complaints were pointless ; and hanno ’ s supporters tried to discredit him by exaggerating the importance of his victory
we repeat , who can fail to see that in that form it is much more indelible ?
it ’ s a monkey gone wrong , observed gauchère
do you know , girl , what from then on i would see between the book and me ?
mâtho stayed behind the balustrade
you will be humble , do you understand , and submit to his desire , which is the order of heaven !
she stayed for a moment without speaking
the carthaginians booed and shouted that they were cowards
yes , mother , the girl went on , quite distraught , they want to kill me
that is monsieur le président
quite certainly , answered the poet
and while the archdeacon went off one way , he took himself off in another , saying to himself in an undertone : this is a fine business , maître pierre gringoire
to drive back the maniples encircling them , they pivoted on their hindlegs , continually wheeling round as they went forward
at every bush their number increased : and the carthaginians , lying on the ground , heard the tramp of their feet in the dark
qui verbum meum audit , et credit ei qui misit me , habet vitam aeternam et injudicium non venit ; sed transit a morte in vitam
a pack of dogs barked
they were as still as the mountain and the dead
it is certain that nothing less than jupiter ’ s intervention could have saved the four unfortunate sergeants of the bailiff of the palais
then , all of a tremble , i called the watch
it ’ s been known for churches to defend themselves like that , he observed with a sigh , saint sophia in constantinople , forty years ago now , threw mahomet ’ s crescent to the ground three times in succession by shaking its domes , which are like its heads
then , to right , to left , to east , to west , within the bounds of the city , narrow though they were , rose the steeples of its twenty-one churches , of every date , shape and size , from the low , decaying romanesque campanile of saint-denys-du-pas , career glaucini [ prison of glaucinus ] , to the delicate spires of saint-pierre-aux-bœufs and saint-landry
the stronger ones , at the sound of the eating vessels , pulled themselves up and cried out : that was how gisco had seen salammbo
she said , will it be soon ?
thenceforth the carthaginians attempted no more sorties – and they had no thought of surrender , certain that they would be tortured to death
gringoire hastened to give him as succinct an account as possible of all that the reader already knows , his adventure in the court of miracles and his marriage ceremony with the broken pitcher
in fact a lot of the ulcers have closed up
hanno replied that he had brought it
at that point the priest knelt down on the balustrade to have a better view
fine singers , retorted the other ; their voices are even sharper than their pointed caps !
some men rushed up
thank you , she said
they came into a narrow gorge ; narr ’ havas smilingly informed them that he no longer knew the way ; spendius found it again
he was explaining to the captains the endless burdens placed on the republic its treasury was empty
but the etruscans , fastened to their chain , did not budge ; the dead , unable to fall , formed an obstacle with their corpses ; and this great bronze line successively opened and closed up , supple as a serpent , unshakeable as a wall
he looked evil , haughty , and stiff-necked
after the shattering fiasco of his first attempt at drama he did not dare go back to his previous lodgings in the rue grenier-sur-l ’ eau , opposite the port-au-foin , having counted on what monsieur the provost was to give him for the epithalamium to pay maître guillaume doulx-sire , who farmed the tax on cloven-footed beasts in paris , the six months ’ rent he owed , that is , number sols parisis ; twelve times more than the value of all his worldly possessions , including his breeches , shirt , and bycocket hat
she rapidly threw a long yellow veil over her hair , wound a scarf round her neck , stuck her feet into blue leather boots and said to taanach :
however , the heads of a few priests in the distant choir-stalls could vaguely be seen moving about , and at the moment when the great door opened there came from the church the sound of a grave , sonorous , and monotonous chant , casting over the condemned woman ’ s head , as it were , in one gust after another , fragments of dismal psalms
then the confraternity of fools , recovering from their initial stupefaction , tried to defend their pope , who had been so rudely dethroned
what do you want ?
such an act would not just have been a small patch on the face of his reputation to embellish it , but a malignant ulcer to disfigure it
quasimodo , wholly unaware of the question addressed to him , continued to stare at the judge and did not answer
how do you know ?
how i ’ d bite you if the bars didn ’ t get in the way
you can see the separate undulations of each group of notes escaping from the peals ; you can follow the dialogue , alternately deep and shrill , of the lightest and the heaviest bell , the rattle and the bourdon : you can see the octaves leap from one belfry to the next ; you can watch them spring winged , light , and whistling from the silver bell , fall broken and lame from the wooden one ; among them you can admire the rich gamut falling and rising ceaselessly from the seven bells of saint-eustache ; you can see clear , rapid notes running across like three or four bright zigzags and vanishing like lightning flashes
the arrows flying round him did not seem to frighten him any more than a flock of swallows
dom claude heard the officer say to the student :
round the two main streams drops of this terrible rain were being sprinkled over the attackers , penetrating their skulls like gimlets of flame
look , there she is , where you see that bunch of halberds
i have had enough of their conversation !
suddenly they heard a plaintive chant , loud and soft , which rose and fell in the air like the wing-beats of a wounded bird
but such a presumptuous wish to mix with punic blood angered the people ; they were brutally given to understand that they had nothing more coming to them
at first she walked in the darkness without meeting anyone , because all were hurrying towards the fire ; and the clamour increased , huge flames reddened the sky behind ; a long terrace stopped her
she ’ s quite capable of that
he had been brought up to keep his eyes downcast and his voice low
so the carthaginians were afraid , they were fleeing !
the soldiers , clinging to the beam , pulled back
the man in black did not let him finish
were you relying on them to kill each other so as to save you the distress of keeping your word ?
to a cordelier friar for hearing a criminal ’ s confession , number sols parisis
clopin was interrupted by a fearful crash resounding at that moment behind him
[ go now , dubious soul , and may god be merciful to you ]
the great symbol of architecture , babel , is a beehive
gringoire continued in a state of exaltation
what has he engraved there on his crucible ?
the greenery of the countryside disappeared in places beneath long patches of yellow ; carobs shone like coral buttons ; vines fell down from the tops of sycamores ; the murmur of water could be heard ; crested larks hopped about , and the last rays of the sun gilded the shells of the tortoises , as they came out of the reeds to sniff the breeze
let ’ s fetch her some scraps from the public buffet
put it to the vote !
in the fifteenth century paris was still divided into three quite distinct and separate towns , each with its own physiognomy , specialities , way of life , customs , privileges , history : the city , the university , the town
an orphan , an elder brother , head of the family at number , he felt rudely recalled from his academic dreams to the realities of the world
but let ’ s be friends this evening
what are you talking about , damoiselle oudarde musnier ?
let ’ s settle for eve and her apple , said the student ; then , taking phoebus by the arm : by the way , my dear captain , a moment ago you mentioned the rue coupe-gueule
her legs went up the height of the wall
their maniples wheeled , with space between them
there was nothing mocking or ironic in the priest ’ s glance ; it was serious , calm and piercing
do you know whom you are talking to ?
there ’ s no one here !
from the fine of number sols paid by every barber who shaves on a feast day , number sols go to you , and we have what ’ s left
each one wore an iron collar , and the crowd never grew tired of coming to look at them
the two thousand barbarians were tied up against the steles of the tombs in the mappalia ; and merchants , kitchen porters , embroiderers , even women , widows of the dead with their children , anyone who wanted to , came along to kill them with arrows
do tell her , fair cousin , that it ’ s out of fashion today , and that her blazon of hinge [ gond ] and laurel [ laurier ] embroidered on her dress makes her look like a walking chimneypiece
he caught the following scrap of conversation :
a light appeared at the cracks in the door
so the historical significance of its architecture is being erased every day
it was his old friend , his old master , the archdeacon
the samnite , bending his knees , swung his axe alternately to left and right , warning mâtho of the blows aimed at him
they looked her up and down , then looked at each other , and it had all been said
the pillory leads to the gallows
spendius first read the letter three times over ; and , supported by two cappadocians who held him sitting on their shoulders , he had himself carried from place to place , and read it again
the night passed in great distress ; a number of them even got rid of their arms to mitigate the suffete ’ s anger when he appeared
i am your prisoner !
indeed fleur-de-lys was looking straight at him , deeply moved by fear , pleasure , and admiration
mâtho wanted to bear the proposal to the suffete himself
two carbuncles from egypt
the same silence , the same immobility
he turned his back on the condemned girl , his head sank back on to his chest , he folded his hands , rejoined his procession of priests , and a moment later he was seen disappearing , with the cross , candles , and copes , beneath the hazy arches of the cathedral ; and his sonorous voice gradually died away in the choir as he chanted the despairing verse :
the shrill howls of the women filled the houses , and coming through the grills made the chatting bystanders in public places turn round
don ’ t talk about him
go to the devil !
only , here , the corpse was alive
the huge beasts toppled over , falling on top of each other
it ’ s so that we can get married , she replied
at the same time the priest threw a purse at jehan which raised a big lump on the student ’ s forehead , and left him both amazed and pleased as he went away , like a dog pelted with marrow-bones
the man , who asked for nothing better than to engage them in conversation , looked at them with a smile
as for the carthaginians , they were angry at their long ordeal of terror
with every moment she discovered some new deformity in quasimodo
they went out of sight
in the court of miracles , replied a fourth spectre who had accosted them
my father was hanged by the burgundians and my mother ripped open by the picards at the time of the siege of paris twenty years ago
what do you want then ?
salammbo turned away from this unclean food , and fell asleep on the horse cloths laid out in a corner of the room
between the suburbs of the temple and saint-martin , about number toises from the walls of paris , a few crossbow shots from la courtille , could be seen on the top of a gentle , imperceptible eminence , high enough to be visible for several leagues around , a strangely shaped structure , somewhat resembling a celtic cromlech , and where human sacrifices were also made
next came all the inferior forms of the divinity
they were almost touched
gringoire , still followed by his three persecutors , and not too sure what was going to come of all this , walked in dismay among the others , turning the cripples aside , stepping over the ones with no legs , getting his feet tangled in this anthill of the disabled , like the english captain who was sucked under by an army of crabs
something like a wave of tenderness seized them
the reader has perhaps not forgotten the shameless beggar who had come to cling to the fringes of the cardinal ’ s tribune once the prologue began
by the woman ’ s side was a little goat , its bleating mingling with the final bleat of the clock
now he was on the left bank facing utica , and in a vast plain , favourable to the elephants which provided the strength of his army
the recluse did not answer , but began mumbling in a singsong tone , angry and mocking : daughter of egypt !
he repeated thoughtfully his fateful words : no one will have her !
maître jacques charmolue spoke up gently : in view of the painful obstinacy of the accused , i call for the question to be applied
maître olivier went out and came back a moment later with the two prisoners , surrounded by archers of the ordinance
everything was hustle and bustle and shouting
at the points where the currents intersect in the heavens , they produce light ; at their points of intersection within the earth they produce gold
hurry , quick , you , olivier !
their flashing eyes had a wary look , habitual experience of travel and lies , trade and command , gave their whole person an air of cunning and violence , a sort of veiled and convulsive brutality
the barbarians had tried at first to envelop him with small detachments ; he always escaped
however , the shock had , so to speak , roused the recluse
then , beyond the grand and beyond the petit châtelet a first ring of walls and towers began to encroach on the countryside on both banks of the seine
it ’ s disappointing , he said in conclusion , but it ’ s due to the fact that i was unlucky enough to marry a virgin
then with the toe of his boot he pushed into the flames any objects that spilled over , so that nothing should remain
he stood up , and as he was afraid , took the breviary lamp to light his way
the tree trunk never varies , the foliage is a matter of caprice
i will take away with me the genius of my house , my black serpent sleeping up there on lotus leaves !
at the same time as the sun she saw at the window an object which frightened her ; the unfortunate face of quasimodo
he said , and i shall have you
the nearest buildings to them were the bishop ’ s palace and the church
then , still as the corpse , they stayed listening for a time
at times he looked wildly at a kind of narrow ledge some ten feet below , formed by chance in the sculptures , and he begged heaven from the depths of his soul in distress that he might finish out his life on that space of two square feet , even if it were to last a hundred years
they had no chance of winning , not even of surviving ; but they were the better men , braver and stronger
the malice of parisians who interfere in everything , even what concerns them least , claimed that few widows had been seen there
from the other side of the town , where spurts of flame now shot out with pillars of smoke , the mercenaries ’ ambassadors were at their last gasp
the priest put his hand over his brow
what have i done to you ?
ten minutes later the horsemen of the watch were fleeing in terror before a long procession of dark , silent men going down towards the pont-au-change , through the winding streets which cut in every direction through the dense quarter of les halles
so much and so little !
i will carry out my promise… ’
the slave threw stones at it ; and they went into a high vaulted room
you are my master !
but with a cry of terror he threw himself behind them and sheltered behind their bodies ; he stammered : there they are !
at the time of which we are writing the tour-roland cell was occupied
it was she who did so first
his felt bycocket and leather jerkin stood out conspicuously amid the silk and velvet around him
that is the only science
when the memory of the earliest peoples felt overloaded , when mankind ’ s store of memories became so heavy and confused that speech , bare and fleeting , risked losing some on the way , they were transcribed on the ground in what was at once the most visible , the most durable , and the most natural fashion
as long as that headlong course lasted , the girl had been unable to regain full consciousness ; half comatose , half awake , all she had felt was going up in the air , floating , flying , being carried off by something above the earth
her pretty little shoe , lord , have you no pity for it ?
that granted , the number of chapels , doorways , steeples , spires can be endlessly modified , according to the fancy of the age , the people , the art
the barbarians found themselves crushed against the phalanx
where did you leave him , iddibal ?
just then she heard a voice saying to the provost :
i like my omelettes bald
from the master of the sentences ’ he had fallen on the capitularies of charlemagne
it could be seen from clypaea , rhades , and cape hermaeum
is the little goat with the girl ?
his flowing black cloak , fastened on his head to a gold mitre studded with precious stones , and hanging all round down to his horses ’ s hooves , merged from afar with the colour of the night
the torn canvas flapped in the wind ; sometimes its long strips passed in front of his face and he noticed a red mark , like a handprint
i know it for a fact , replied the protonotary
he ’ s probably going to look for lodgings in the rue thibautodé , cried jehan du moulin
i get up on it , and say out loud the first thing that occurs to me , what i have at heart ; and when you ’ re one of the people , sire , you ’ ve always got something at heart
then , seeing that no one was listening , he had stopped them , and during the quarter-hour or so that the interruption lasted , he had been ceaselessly tapping his foot , jumping about , hailing gisquette and liénarde , encouraging his neighbours to have the prologue resumed ; all in vain
work so highly regarded as to be considered unique !
listen , said spendius , and first of all have no fear !
he gave it a gentle push and stuck his head through the opening
greatness goes with the crown
and , sitting up all dishevelled : mercy !
at that moment a silly fly , looking for the march sun , blundered into the net and became stuck there
besides , mahiette went on , paquette ’ s baby didn ’ t only have pretty feet
it has also a calvary sculpted in the round in a cellar and a sun made of gilded wood
he kissed every finger on her hands , her arms , her feet , and end to end the long plaits of her hair
these sensual images made him clench his fists and sent a shiver down his spine
but the door had opened so quietly that nothing had made dom claude aware of his presence
you must not confuse different kinds of play
his voice fading away , he repeated several times more , mechanically , at quite long intervals , like a bell drawing out its last vibrations : because of her … because of her … !
he was forced to realize that he was not walking in the styx but in the mire , that he was not being jostled by devils but by robbers ; that it was not his soul that was at stake but quite simply his life ( since he lacked the precious intermediary which so effectively conciliates thief and honest man : a purse )
whereupon the bishop felt constrained to quote him the legate odo ’ s ordinance , making an exception for certain great ladies , aliquae magnates mulieres , quae sine scandalo evitari non possunt [ some ladies of high rank , who can not be shunned without scandal ]
when the acclamation of the men had died down , the women hid their faces with their sleeves and all together let out a weird cry , like a wolf howling , so furious and strident that it seemed to make the great ebony staircase , covered in women , vibrate from top to bottom like a lyre
curses on you who hastened her ruin by your ignominy !
he exclaimed , almost in fright
he was no less exercised about the constitution of the world then the nature of the gods ; with the armillary spheres placed in the portico at alexandria he had observed the equinoxes and accompanied as far as cyrene ptolemy ’ s land surveyors , who measure the heavens by calculating the number of their paces ; and as a result there was now growing in his mind a religion of his own , with no distinct formula and , for that very reason , heady and fervent in the extreme
i put the coin away in my drawer and say : that will do to buy some tripe tomorrow from the flayers at la gloriette
and then you conveniently get rid of them , don ’ t you ?
and first of all , how is it that we haven ’ t seen you for nearly two months now , and then find you again in the street , handsomely turned out , to be sure—half yellow and half red like a caudebec apple ?
she looked taller to him than when she had been alive ; he saw the moon through her white robe ; he heard her breathing
she couldn ’ t work any more , because her life of sensual pleasure had made her idle , and she suffered much more , because as she became idle she had become more sensual—at least that ’ s how monsieur le curé of saint-remy explains why such women feel the cold and hunger more than other poor women when they grow old
the grey dawn was just beginning
good virgin in heaven !
but when the helepolis was about thirty paces away , he ordered planks set up , above the streets , between the houses , from the cisterns to the rampart ; and people formed a line , passing from hand to hand helmets and amphorae which they emptied continually
at the same time as the arts , thought set itself free on every side
few then knew what manner of man was guillaume rym
now imagine this vast oblong hall , lit by the wan light of a january day , invaded by a motley , noisy crowd drifting round the walls and swirling round the pillars , and you will already have a vague idea of the whole scene which we shall try to depict in more precise and curious detail
at the rustle of her dress mâtho half opened his eyes , bringing his mouth forward on to her hands , and the dagger fell
the suffete jumped into his chariot and took the reins ; the two beasts , arching their necks and striking in unison the stones that flew up , galloped at great speed right up the mappalian way , and the silver vulture on the tip of the shaft seemed to be flying , such was the speed of the chariot
and they would not wait long , since the people of tunis , the whole of libya , were springing to their aid
but an abyss came up and pushed them away from her , at an infinite distance
at first they shared with the women
gudule palpitated between life and death as she watched him scanning the square with the restless look of a hunting-dog that senses the quarry ’ s lair nearby and is reluctant to move away
said compère jacques , that he is their lord
she fell to her knees , her head on the bed , hands clasped upon her head , filled with anxiety and trembling , and though a gypsy , idolatrous and pagan , she began sobbing to beg mercy of the good christian god and to pray to our lady , her hostess
he pulled mâtho behind tanit ’ s carriage , where a gap , a cubit wide , split the wall from top to bottom
the suffete opened the gates to them ; they were defectors ; they ran to their master , inspired by dread or loyalty
in palaces , in fortresses , it was a prison , sometimes again a sepulchre , sometimes both together
he spluttered in a voice choking with rage
his beard and nails were abnormally overgrown , and he swayed to right and left with the continuous rhythm of a captive beast
he saw , as he chanced to look round , a kind of shadow creeping along the walls behind him
it was one of spendius ’ ideas , which many people thought perfectly simple and practicable
perhaps it ’ s a word which she thinks is endowed with some magic and secret virtue
was this the phoebus whose accursed name , ever since his interview with gringoire , kept cropping up in his thoughts ?
how can it be done ?
they went on for another two hours towards the west when suddenly before them they saw a mass of little flames
then eschmoûn unfolded in the starry space ; khamon shone in the sun ; melkarth , with his arms , pushed it behind gades ; the cabiri went down under the volcanoes , and rabbetna , like a nurse , leaned over the world , pouring out her light like milk and her might like a mantle
she cried in tones of indescribable distress , mother !
the second was a pale , smiling figure already known to the reader
she tried to speak , to cry out , to call gringoire ; her tongue lay inert in her mouth , and no sound came from her lips
an idea occurred to him
but more reasonable attitudes were called for , times were hard – and if a master has only three olives , is it not right that he should keep two for himself ?
her sandals , cut from birds ’ plumage , had very high heels and she was extraordinarily pale , no doubt because of the cold
the gypsy girl presented it to gringoire
particularly noticeable was a little man , carefully wrapped in a cloak with his face hidden under a visor pulled down very low
yes , i love you
in the parvis there were a few groups of honest bystanders , calmly trying to guess who the madman might be who was amusing himself in such a peculiar way
for a few minutes he had run up and down along the gallery like a madman , seeing from above the packed mass of truands ready to rush upon the church , asking the devil , or god , to save the gypsy girl
the gypsy girl said sharply , as though waking up with a start
so it was a very agreeable and pleasant existence that maître robert led
no hearth , no home ,
the whole legion had closed ranks behind him , and his three beggars held him fast
the student made one more attempt : brother claude , at least give me one little parisis for some food
you two must pretend to be reading dominus in the breviary while i have a peep through the window
he fixed the number of servants and cut down the baggage ; and as roman pila were kept in the temple of moloch , he took them , despite the pontiffs ’ protests
this assault ’ had jerked her out of her reverie
it happened in a flash
they trussed him up in a new system of straps and buckles , he let them buckle and bind him
and among those monsters roused from their stone slumbers by the flame , by the noise , was one walking about , who could be seen from time to time passing across the blazing front of the pyre like a bat in front of a candle
without it they are blind men groping about in their search for god
do you know , the priest went on after a further silence , why you are here ?
the dark night made the deaf man blind
the gods ’ sanction was not lacking ; for from all corners of the sky ravens swooped down
apparently so , the compère answered , stammering , still quite dazed at the abrupt and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the mind of the king
with those which had come back from utica and others in private possession he organized a phalanx of seventy-two elephants and made them formidable
the hermaphrodite baals unveil themselves for us alone , men in spirit , women in weakness
here we give up any attempt at description
go on , mahiette , please
over a first tunic , thin and wine-coloured , she drew on a second , embroidered with bird feathers
two of my friends would like to buy baby clothes for the child of a poor haudriette widow
dominum nostrum , added compère tourangeau , making the sign of the cross
salammbo sat in a chair with ivory rungs and gave herself up to the slave ’ s attentions
and without concerning himself with cretan jupiter the hosier answered with a heavy smile , eyes fixed on gringoire : oh !
all right , go back !
round the city , outside the ramparts , the eye was lost in a great ring of fluffy vapours through which one could dimly discern the indefinite line of the plains and the graceful swelling of the hills
the gold écu turned into a dry leaf ( continued )
but his mother ought to have carried the cake herself
you did not think about it !
if it ’ s my age you want to know , said quasimodo , i think i ’ ll be number at martinmas
louis xi made paris an asylum in number
he wept with rage as he imagined how many prurient watchers had found satisfaction in the loosely fastened shift ; and in the thought that this lovely girl , this virgin lily , this cup of modesty and delights to which he would only have dared to bring his lips in fear and trembling , had just been transformed into a kind of public trough , at which the meanest rabble in paris , thieves , beggars , lackeys , had come to drink in common their shameless , impure , and depraved pleasure
the curfew had sounded long ago , and it was only at rare intervals that anyone passed by on the pavement or that a light shone at a window
the provost went on , having woken up that morning in such a bad temper , as we have said , that his fury did not need to be stirred up by such strange replies
la esmeralda smiled , sighed , and remained silent
gringoire got up on the stool , and managed , not without some wobbling of head and arms , to find his centre of gravity
the mercenaries wanted to know if he had said anything more , and the libyan added :
come up and look !
hamilcar had taken all the weapons !
it was indeed seven o ’ clock
lend an ear , then , to this chorus from all the steeples , spread over the whole the murmur of half a million people , the everlasting plaint of the river , the infinite breathing of the wind , the deep and distant quartet of the four forests ranged over the hills on the horizon like immense organ cases , damp down as in a half-tone everything too raucous and shrill in the central peal , and then say whether you know anything in the world more rich , joyful , golden , dazzling than this tumult of bells and chimes ; this furnace of music ; these ten thousand brazen voices singing at once in stone flutes three hundred feet high ; this city transformed into an orchestra ; this symphony of tempestuous sound
no , by the holy rood !
exhaustion , lack of proper weapons , the fright caused by the surprise , the musketry from the windows , the stout charge of the king ’ s men , everything overwhelmed them
listen , the priest said at last , strangely calm again
you can feel pity , i ’ m sure
curse me , as long as i hear your voice !
nothing could force the slightest movement out of him
there was nothing for it but to go along with the torrent
and whom do you rebel against like that ?
which way did she go ?
cried her lively companions ; and they all rushed to the edge of the balcony , while fleur-de-lys , preoccupied with her fiance ’ s coolness , slowly followed them and he , relieved by this incident which cut short an uncomfortable conversation , went back inside the apartment with the contented look of a soldier whose duty is over
drome-daries , smeared with pitch like boats , knocked over women carrying children at their hips
and turning with an abrupt gesture to the bold fleming : have you ever seen a revolt , maître jacques ?
a tent door opened
the unfortunate man heard them reply : no !
a breath of wind , a passing cloud , anything at the moment is enough to upset and disturb you !
then fleeing soldiers arrived with the story of the rout ; and the punic army stopped
but i ’ ve no ink left
she opened her ample cloak , and flung wide her arms to unfold the zaïmph
they were given amulets to ward off illness ; but the givers had spat on them three times to attract death , or enclosed within them jackal hairs to inspire cowardice
they struck against the shafts of the lances , but the cavalry from behind restricted their attack , and the phalanx , supported by the elephants , grew tighter and longer , presented itself in the shape of a square , a cone , a rhomb , a trapeze , a pyramid
in fact the mercenaries , to prevent their old prisoners from running away , had broken their legs with bronze bars : and they were all rotting away piled up in a pit , in the middle of all the refuse
then the two sieges were intolerably tedious ; they were getting nowhere ; it would be better to have a battle !
then he came to a desperate decision
the reader knows that it is from this tower that one can see the hôtel de ville
then he looked round quickly for schahabarim
schahabarim ’ s words came back to her memory
he said , my dear jupiter !
one of the men holding the girl turned towards him
the emerald vine glowed
there are forty most excellent proverbs about the philosopher ’ s ragged cloak
monseigneur , guillaume rym replied , let ’ s be content with having been let off half the comedy
one morning ( for all these things happened at night ) , she could no longer see it
at the same time the cassock ripped apart
printing is killing off the book trade
they set off again at a rapid pace
happy is he who is sawn between two planks , torn apart by four horses !
don ’ t you know , then , that our children come from our wombs , and that a mother who has lost her child no longer believes in god ? —ah !
i ’ d rather be a fly ’ s head than a lion ’ s tail
in the second tower were six other bells , and finally the six smallest lived in the spire over the crossing with the wooden bell , rung only from the afternoon of maundy thursday until the morning of easter eve
it was a dead body which remained hanging there , bent in half , back broken , skull empty
he spoke in punic , and those who surrounded him ( the most alert who had run up without their arms ) were campanians , gauls , and greeks , so that no one in this crowd understood him
facing him , amid the olives , palms , myrtles , and plane trees , spread out two broad lagoons which ran into another lake whose outline could not be seen
for some little time a young priest had been listening to the arguments of the haudriettes and the utterances of the protonotary
the second one , old , dark , wrinkled , hideous , ugly enough to be noticeable even in the court of miracles , walked all round gringoire
she maintained a profound silence
abdalonim turned away his head in a sign of horror , and in resignation hamilcar did not speak
the lighthouse , built at the top of the cliff at the back , lit up the sky with a great red glow , and the shadow of the palace , with its superimposed terraces , projected over the gardens like a monstrous pyramid
during that time the other two armies would try to reach him in the south , spendius from the east , mâtho from the west , so that all three should meet to surprise and encircle him
mâtho suffered a vague feeling of gloom
he went ice-cold at the thought that she might perhaps come there too ; if she had done so , he would have died of terror
was it perfidy or folly ?
they had loin cloths of bark threads , tunics of dried grass , the muzzles of wild beasts on their heads , and howling like wolves they shook rods fitted with rings and brandished cows ’ tails at the end of sticks as standards
he had braced himself against adversity
as each plain ended there invariably followed a circular plateau ; then they went down again into a valley , and the mountains which seemed to block the horizon seemed to slide away at their approach
she carefully examined the philosopher ’ s deplorable doublet
so as early as the sixteenth century the printing press , grown now to equal stature with declining architecture , fights and slays its rival
the crowd of truands , cheering loudly , pressed around its foot to go up
well , thought gringoire , there are still enough left to hear the end of my mystery
the voice of the young rascal armed from head to foot rose over the hubbub
is that the gallows we ’ re going to use for the job ?
dom claude hardly looked at his brother
we repeat , these hybrid constructions are not the least interesting for the artist , the antiquary , the historian
then came a scattering of huts made of earth , branches , and rush hurdles , all cone-shaped
but the naffur rushed to meet them
he said to himself , for gringoire , like any true dramatic poet , was given to monologues ; now they ’ re blocking me from the fire !
the poor accused seemed to be watching , but her blurred eyes no longer saw
at sunset the army went out by the western gate ; but instead of taking the tunis road or making for the mountains in the direction of utica , they continued along by the sea ; they soon reached the lagoon , where round areas , quite white with salt , shimmered like gigantic silver dishes , forgotten on the shore
master , i must tell you the story of the logis barbeau
the little goat too bleated with delight
you can only see one of its eyes , observed mademoiselle guillemette , there ’ s a wart over the other
the two of them were allowed to plunge into a dark , narrow street , where no one dared venture after them
meanwhile the archdeacon was panting
the moon had gone in
how many times did i appeal to you ?
you see , good brother claude , we know our latin
almost at the same moment he felt himself being lifted up by a powerful arm ; the cell was dark , he could not clearly make out who was holding him like that ; but he could hear teeth chattering with rage , and there was just enough light scattered in the darkness for him to see a large cutlass blade glinting above his head
he had other things on his mind
she let out a feeble cry
she stammered in her grief , hiding her face in her lovely hands , she ’ s a magician !
spendius , sitting on a dromedary stolen from hamilcar ’ s pens , caught sight of mâtho in the distance , watering his mule , bareheaded , bending down to see the water flow past , his arm in a sling on his chest
once a way through had been cleared , and that took less than a minute , she seized her daughter round the waist and pulled her into the cell
for it is always the first day for a mother who has lost her child
the pointed arch is between the two
feudalism demanded to share with theocracy , pending the inevitable arrival of the people who would , as always , take the lion ’ s share
she rejected the cake that mahiette offered her , and said : black bread
he came up to gringoire and pushed him roughly by the shoulder
hamilcar raised his head ; he did not utter a word , did not make a move
he said , now all four of us are safe
they called their men , pulled them by the cloak , beat their breasts as they cursed them , and stretched out their naked weeping infants
do you love me ?
men of that kind have nine lives
the knowledge that he was there was enough to make people believe they could see the hundreds of statues in the galleries and doorways living and stirring
he had guessed she was a carthaginian woman from the little sandastrum beads bouncing against her boots ; and , sensing some important secret , with his companions ’ help he had managed to get out of the pit ; then on hands and elbows he had dragged himself twenty paces further , as far as mâtho ’ s tent
the audience , however , began to whisper and exchange looks
then this great mass of men , after swaying to and fro for a time , stopped ; they could find no way out
he will have suffered like mummol
once he had taken that decision , he began to examine the enemy more calmly
it flowed continuously in passages of soaring lyricism , melodies , unexpected cadences , then simple phrases sprinkled with sharp , sibilant notes , cascades of scales which would have defeated a nightingale , but where the harmony was always present , then softly rippling octaves , rising and falling like the young singer ’ s breast
they were asking for the suffete
at the rate paris is going it will be renewed every fifty years
meanwhile there was nothing visible on the façade , the light from the torches not reaching as far as the top
some gypsy girl from bohemia , said fleur-de-lys , casually turning round towards the square
on the top of the highest gallery , higher than the central rose-window , rose a great flame between the two bell towers with swirls of sparks , a great , ragged , furious flame , from which at times the wind would snatch a strip into the smoke
the presence of this extraordinary being sent round the whole cathedral some indefinable breath of life
at the same time one of them took a handful of straw which he went to light from the wick in front of the good virgin
however he was inspecting her so keenly that salammbo stammered in embarrassment :
said spendius : and he repeated several times : him !
then the suffete put his hand in the hands of the ten barbarians in turn , gripping their thumbs ; after that he rubbed his hand on his clothes , because their viscous skin was rough and flabby to touch , slimy and tingling in a revolting way
you have the dossier of evidence , messieurs , the king ’ s advocate added as he sat down , and you can consult the statement of phoebus de châteaupers
she turned her back , and threw into the bowl a silver florin which rang out among the liards and made the poor sisters of the étienne haudry chapel stare wide-eyed
in your father ’ s name have mercy !
their hands and legs were tied ; then when they had been laid on the ground side by side , the elephants were brought back
where shall we go ?
salammbo leaned swooning against the cushions of the bed
they attacked half-heartedly and were repulsed
suddenly he turned towards claude as swiftly and nimbly as a wagtail :
seventy-five soldiers pulled on ropes , arranged at the base of a gigantic beam , suspended horizontally from chains coming down from a bracket , and ending in a ram ’ s head of solid bronze
but that splendid moment did not last
you are such a lovely boy !
the rabbet had tortured him for too long ; and in despair , or perhaps for want of a god completely satisfying to his mind , he finally decided for this one
zarxas , with a sling round his head , sang war songs ; autharitus brandished his great sword ; spendius breathed a word to one , gave another a dagger
ballestas de buen echar
she smiles at it , kisses it , talks to it
la esmeralda was still there , in the same place , the same posture
she did not seem to hear
from time to time a smile and a sigh met on his lips , but the smile revealed more pain than the sigh
so you still think of me !
they began others in different places ; hamilcar always guessed their direction by putting his ear to a bronze shield
then the carthaginian wings deployed to seize them ; the elephants followed them
then the barbarians , dissatisfied with their invention , improved it ; they hurled all kinds of filth , human excrement , bits of carrion , corpses
come on , to work !
but your toll dues at triel , saint-james , and saint-germain-en-laye always give a good yield
pilloried in the selfsame square where only the day before he had been greeted , acclaimed , and adjudged pope and prince of fools , in procession with the duke of egypt , the king of tunis , and the emperor of galilee
he recalled countless details , and soon no longer doubted that the archdeacon had taken the gypsy from him
so he ran off to the buffet
maître florian none the less delivered his judgements without appeal and most appropriately
my lord , said gringoire , are you absolutely set on having me break a limb ?
he runs barefoot , like a shepherd , on the edge of precipices
her old father died while paquette was still a small child ; so all she had was her mother , the sister of monsieur mathieu pradon , master brazier and coppersmith in paris , in the rue parin-garlin , who died last year
the provost of paris , a royal , not a municipal official , had jurisdiction over the whole
they went all round the back looking for a way out
this will kill that
then you ’ ll be hanged
who has got my baby ?
at dom claude ’ s unexpected proposal , the poet ’ s open , kindly face had suddenly darkened , like some smiling italian landscape when an untimely gust of wind blows up and blots out the sun with a cloud
here phoebus scratched his ear— ’ ah !
what was certain was that la esmeralda had come to france , still very young , by way of hungary
haven ’ t you had your fill ?
he attempted to pull the mother loose , for she had , so to speak , knotted both hands around her daughter ’ s waist , but she clung to the child so tenaciously that it was impossible to separate them
i see no reason why history should not transmit to posterity the names of these four discreet and venerable ladies
those who were having irons put on them tore at their faces with their nails
her sequined dress sparkled blue and star-spangled like a summer night
may you be cursed !
with this appeared the marks of the great blows they had received for carthage ’ s sake ; they looked like inscriptions on columns
the whole results in harmony
it came down slowly , like a drop of water running along a wall , crawled among the scattered garments , then , its tail stuck against the ground , reared up straight ; and its eyes , more brilliant than carbuncles , fixed on salammbo
the worst of it was that next day when i went to get the écu to buy my tripe , i found a dry leaf in its place
those who had not yet been paid grew angry
the same evening he sent the grand council a dromedary laden with bracelets collected off the dead , and with horrible threats , ordered them to send him another army
… a woman ’ s mouth is constantly pure ; it is running water , a sunbeam
they all bore him some grudge , some for his malice , others for his ugliness
everyone became brave from excess of terror
maître jacques , you are the king ’ s attorney in the ecclesiastical court , this parchment is an abomination !
do you understand me , soldier ?
the carthaginians were still horror-stricken by their arrival when they saw , coming straight towards them , what looked like monsters and buildings , with their masts , arms , rigging , joints , roofs , and carapaces , the siege engines sent by the tyrian towns : sixty carrobalistae , eighty onagers , thirty scorpions , fifty swing beams , twelve rams , and three gigantic catapults which hurled boulders weighing fifteen talents
but for her , where would you be ?
how right i am not to drink and how excellently saint benedict puts it : vinum apostatare facit enim sapientes [ wine makes even wise men go astray ]
this show was as good as any other
so it was all the rage
enormous wineskins bristling with pipes made a shrill splashing ; tambourines , beaten with the full force of the arm , rang out with dull and rapid bangs ; and , despite the frenzy of the trumpets , the salsalim clicked like the wings of a cricket
are the canons defending themselves ?
they had stuffed up the holes in their breastplates with the shoulder bones of animals and replaced their bronze boots with ragged sandals
two drinkers came out
she was in a frenzy , crying , fondling , kissing it
from time to time he went up on to the cupola of the temple of eschmoûn , by the moon-herald , and looked at the wind
besides , the cardinal would not have been much upset , for the licence on that day was quite taken for granted
the girl looked up at him now and then with eyes full of sweet delight , and their hair mingled in a ray of spring sunshine
as he cast a somewhat indifferent eye round the audience , the uproar increased
and come back at us , said another ; and from the end of the room hanno shouted :
looking at the gibbet
his bald forehead ran with sweat , his nails bled on the stonework , his knees were rubbing raw on the wall
this pré , or meadow , was famous for the uproar which went on there day and night ; it was the hydra ’ of the poor monks of saint-germain , quod monachis sancti-germani pratensis hydra fuit , clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibus [ which was the hydra of the monks of saint-germain-des-prés , since the clerks were always raising new heads of disagreement ]
next day he came himself without a sword , barehanded , with an escort of clibanarii , and told them that , having too many men to feed , he did not intend to keep them
the inquisitive child had removed the bag from round the goat ’ s neck , opened it and emptied the contents on to the matting
i am condemned for what earns you a prize
finally , as if africa had not been sufficiently emptied and , to assemble still more furies , it had been necessary to go to the dregs among races , there could be seen , behind all the others , men with the features of animals and giggling with idiot laughs ; wretches ravaged by hideous diseases , deformed pygmies , mulattoes of dubious sex , albinos with red eyes blinking at the sun ; as they mouthed unintelligible sounds , they put a finger in their mouth to show that they were hungry
he ’ s a nasty evil old king
what is sure is that djali is already almost as fond of me as of her
said the poet , finding reality , that is emptiness , at the bottom of his pocket
hasn ’ t she had any supper ?
only intermittently did a groan of rage swell every cavity in his chest
beside them a dropsy sufferer was deflating himself , and making four or five women thieves hold their noses as they squabbled at the same table over a child they had stolen that evening
abdalonim paled , and went to fetch from another rack sycamore boards threaded in bundles on leather thongs
claude frollo ’ s congratulations to jacques coictier mainly concerned the numerous temporal advantages which the worthy doctor had been able to derive , in the course of his much-envied career , from each of the king ’ s illnesses by practising a better and more reliable alchemy than the search for the philosopher ’ s stone
of the usefulness of windows looking out on to the river
hanno fell on the grass ; and he saw around him still more crosses , as if the tortures by which he was going to perish had multiplied in advance
he raised his voice : maître pierre , i have given much thought to it ; there ’ s only one way to save her
he offered to deliver hamilcar , then they would enter carthage and both be kings
at last , exhausted with struggling and anger , he fell into a wild slumber
sire , your majesty knows that simon radin is dead ?
are you going to believe all these words ?
go and fetch what you need
the water was so clear that you could see the bottom lined with white pebbles
i doubt whether the pharmacopolists and master apothecaries could keep themselves from stoning you if they were here
reduced to itself , abandoned by the other arts because abandoned by human thought , it called in labourers for want of artists
it moved forward proudly and fiercely , the yardarm straight , the sail puffed out along the length of the mast , cutting through the foam around it ; the gigantic oars beat the water rhythmically ; from time to time the end of its keel , made like a ploughshare , appeared , and under the spur at the end of the prow , the ivory-headed horse , rearing up on its hindlegs , seemed to be running over the plains of the sea
no , she answered
go , curses on you !
the moon rose ; then the cithar and the flute , both together , began to play
perhaps a quarter of an hour of the question will drag the truth out of you
you ’ ll let me keep my child when you know !
the gypsy girl is going to pass by !
it hid a sort of vault where mysterious things were kept , things without a name and of inestimable value
then it was that he had approached the unfortunate little creature , object of so much hatred and menaces
a man has a helmet on his head , a sword in his hand , and golden spurs on his heels
she shuddered and turned away ; but applause broke out , drowning the peevish exclamation
the former , the catapults , were composed of a square framework , with two uprights and a horizontal bar
it is a curse !
the witches in italy always have a he-goat waiting at their door
spendius wanted to rebuild the helepolis ; mâtho had traced an ideal line from his tent to megara , and had sworn to himself that he would follow it ; and none of their men stirred
many even did not want to go on
blessings on the republic !
then , when he came to the edge of the lake , he took off his sealskin tunic and untied the cord binding his long red hair which he then soaked in the water
oblong flames wavered over the bronze breastplates
scared of a woman !
what took place within her defies description
i heard some of them shouting : down with the bailiff of the palais !
great buildings , like great mountains , are the work of centuries
the password is : little blade on the prowl !
the actual constitution of the christian church has not been touched by it
the great doors of the church were closed , in contrast to the countless windows round the square , which , open right up to the gables , revealed thousands of heads heaped up something like piles of cannonballs in an artillery park
so he adopted an extremely gentle tone , and began : good brother , do you dislike me so much that you scowl at me for a few slaps and punches dealt out in fair fight to some boys and brats , quibusdam marmosetis ?
several waterspouts with animal faces seemed to be leaning out round her , craning their necks to see her through the window
these last ideas , which had imperceptibly led him away from himself to science , seemed to have calmed him
the gypsy saw the priest run off in the direction of the pont notre-dame
hamilcar took a torch and disappeared into the darkness
not a bit of it
what terrible men , really !
for the rest , he had still not said a word , let out a breath
hamilcar bent his head ; and both were so near the pyre that the bottom of their mantles , as it was raised , from time to time brushed it
quick , quick , said the deaf man , trying to drag the horse along
he engraved a name on a copper plate and buried it in the sand at the entrance to his tent
is it really true then—nothing can move us in a man we hate ?
the apartment they entered contained nothing but a black painting representing another woman
it was pitch dark
with staring eyes and a face as pale as the pearls on his tiara he stood panting , almost frightened at himself and his thoughts absorbed in visions of disaster
you can ’ t see her
maître jacques , rym replied , that ’ s because wine is less cruel to kings than tisane
i thought that i would be cured , like bruno of asti
i want to see her !
asked claude , surprised at the outburst
i will undertake that !
but from so much use the springs of their acharnian slings had broken and several , like herdsmen , were throwing stones by hand ; others were hurling lead bullets with the handle of a whip
to sum up what we have so far sketched very roughly , ignoring countless proofs and also countless objections of detail , it comes to this : architecture up to the fifteenth century was the principal record of mankind ; during that time no concept of any complexity appeared in the world which was not made into a building ; every popular idea like every religious law has had its monuments ; finally , the human race never had an important thought which it did not write down in stone
gringoire reflected on this bitterly in an undertone
we ’ ll take the sainte-marthe room
i know , the hosier answered gravely
then he turned his face towards autharitus and slowly said to him , with an indefinable smile :
beyond the walls a few suburbs pressed around the gates , but they were fewer and more scattered than those of the university
a tuft of white hair stuck up on his head like a crest on a bird ; and with an ironic glance he showed the disguise lying on the ground
the intention was that the army , by moving alternately from the hot-springs mountain to hippo-zarytus , should prevent the suffete approaching the tyrian towns with the possibility of returning to carthage
an idea made him start , and going behind the idol he walked straight to the wall
another time he arrived at the entrance to the cell ( he never went in ) just as la esmeralda was singing an old spanish ballad , of which she did not understand the words , but which had remained in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child
at the jangling of these frightful irons the wretched child started like a dead frog being galvanized
little blade on the prowl
then he gave her a look of profound sadness and fled
across that undulating , hair , darker than a raven ’ s wing , could be seen twisting and knotting a thick grey , coarse rope , chafing her delicate collarbones and twining round the poor girl ’ s charming neck like an earthworm on a flower
one of them had remained standing apart
i hadn ’ t foreseen torture !
the bars held firm
but the three zones merge and amalgamate at their edges , like the colours in the solar spectrum
the man stepped in last
a cloud of odorous vapour escaped
yes , beneath one of those priestly hoods were the writhings of a damned soul
[ therefore , gentlemen , in the presence of a proven vampire , the crime being patent , the criminal intention existent , in the name of the holy church of notre-dame de paris , which is seized of the right of exercising justice of all kinds , high and low , in that undeflled island of the cité , by the tenor of these presents we declare that we demand : first , some pecuniary indemnity ; second , public penance before the great portal of the cathedral church of notre-dame ; thirdly , a sentence by virtue of which this vampire , together with her goat , either in the square commonly called la grève , or where the island comes to a point in the river seine , beside the tip of the royal gardens , be executed ]
seven doors , corresponding with the seven planets , spread over the wall seven differently coloured squares
fortunately the prudent damoiselle oudarde musnier changed the subject in time
these animals were the pride of the great punic houses
i have never regretted the money
young jehan , who had all the acuteness of a spoilt child , judged this a favourable moment for venturing his request
a few carthaginian officers were usually put in the barbarians ’ armies to serve as interpreters ; after the war they had gone into hiding for fear of vengeance , and hanno had not thought of taking them with him ; besides his voice was too low and was lost in the wind
old woman , said this man , who had a most cruel face , we are looking for a witch to hang her ; we ’ ve been told you had her
with the coming of evening she found the night so beautiful , the moon so sweet , that she walked all the way round the lofty gallery encircling the church
here , tristan ! —here with us in the bastille there are the vicomte de gif ’ s fifty lances , which makes three hundred horse ; take them
those of the elders who were in command had come with purple helmets whose magnificent fringes caught in the straps of their boots
we want a lovely peal—poor guillaume !
so there ’ s no way to force that door ?
perhaps even the formidable provost felt his heart failing him
she wears an amulet round her neck which , they maintain , will one day enable her to meet her parents , but which would lose its virtue if the girl lost hers
suddenly , and as if coming from nowhere , spendius appeared
but it ’ s very difficult to get this beam pure , because of the simultaneous presence of the other stars which get mixed up in it
they slapped their right thighs to show how shocked they were , and the sleeves of their robes flapped up like the great wings of frightened birds
at each step he recognized armour , furniture , familiar objects which still surprised him , and under the vestibule there were even still , in a burner , the ashes from the perfumes lit at his departure to entreat melkarth
a book is soon finished , costs so little and can go so far !
as for quasimodo ’ s mysterious disappearance , all we have been able to discover is this
the suffete went into the deserted apartments
what are your orders , mistress ?
then he bent down , stood up , bent down , stood up again in incredible activity
they paraded along khamon ’ s street and the gate of cirta , all mixed-up , archers with hoplites , captains with soldiers , lusitanians with greeks
hamilcar wanted to unite them at once in an indissoluble betrothal
offences committed by students on the left bank , in their own pré-aux-clercs , were tried on the island , in the palais de justice , and punished on the right bank , at montfaucon
he staggered at first
i do not know what the republic will do for you , but hamilcar will not be ungrateful
number livres number sols number deniers parisis
his face all grey and drawn and hollow-eyed because he ’ s so fond of gambling and dice !
hamilcar , emerging suddenly from the bottom of the gorge , had come down on the western slope overlooking hippo-zarytus and , as there was more room at that point , had been careful to draw the barbarians there
on the thread holding her suspended over the abyss , a score of times she had thought she was about to see it snap , and she was at last beginning to breathe again and feel her feet on firm ground
and you say it is directed against the bailiff of the palais de justice ?
the greeks , strapped into their iron swordbelts , listened and tried to make out his words , while the mountaineers , covered in furs like bears , looked at him suspiciously or yawned , leaning on their bronze-studded clubs
was he trying to join the mercenaries ?
that ’ s not a child , agnès
at the back was a table covered with fleurs-de-lys , with a great carved oak armchair , which was the provost ’ s , and empty , and a stool on the left for the auditor , maître florian
he stood up on one of the horses
if they turned to the east they would join the nomads , intercept the road to cyrene and desert trade
said spendius ; and he swiftly climbed from storey to storey , as he had done the first time , helping himself up with a rope and a harpoon
when you were very small and used to cry , i would take you to my heart and make you laugh with the nipples on my breasts ; you dried them up , mistress !
meanwhile the others , like conquerors revelling in extermination , overturned , crushed , trampled , worried the corpses and wreckage
this all happened in less than no time
the barbarians appeared almost at once , but stopped in the middle of the isthmus , on the edge of the lake
i became a soldier , but i wasn ’ t brave enough
there can be no doubt that these are very splendid monuments
those who were not crying out , those who were still alive , looked—two streams of molten lead were falling from the top of the building on to the densest part of the crowd
gringoire would have liked to reply
for one full year if now i lie
this met with loud cheers
when your gypsy mother comes to claim you , i ’ ll tell her : mother , look at that gibbet !
the archdeacon went on , staring at gringoire
he gradually came to his senses ; at first he floated for a short time in a kind of half-somnolent daydream , not wholly unpleasant , in which the airy figures of the gypsy girl and the goat blended with the solid weight of quasimodo ’ s fist
let us add that it is the rule that a building ’ s architecture should be so adapted to its intended function that that function should be self-evident simply from the appearance of the building
sometimes , from end to end , broad currents flowed down , then went up again , and in the middle a heavy mass remained motionless
so you deny it ?
from time to time he looked up at the roof
from afar they recognized the markets , the crossroads ; they argued about the siting of the temples : khamon ’ s , facing the syssitia , had golden tiles ; melkarth ’ s , to the left of eschmoûn , carried branches of coral on its roof ; tanit ’ s , beyond , filled out its copper cupola among the palm-trees ; black moloch was below the water-tanks , towards the lighthouse
several times they were repulsed , but came back again ; mâtho made narr ’ havas ’ s cavalry charge them with lances ; and as the balearics cried out that they needed women :
i have also written a book which will run to six hundred pages on the prodigious comet of number , which drove one man mad
you say that so nicely
it ’ s not that other ideas did not come to me with age
finally it was said , a shocking thing for a boy of number , that his excesses many a time led him even to the rue de glatigny
his heart was brimming with all the tears he was choking back , his two fists , clenched convulsively , struck his head , and when he withdrew them each held a handful of reddish hair
yes , monsieur archdeacon ; by god ’ s gracious mercy
a few paces away stands an enormous pillar , then another and another ; seven pillars in all down the length of the hall , supporting in the middle of its width the springing of the double vaults
sergeants to burn the witches !
the sun warmed the bleached grass ; the ground was all split by cracks which divided it into what looked like monstrous slabs
he took two handfuls of this dust , the mere sight of which made all the carthaginians shiver with horror , and said :
be quiet , woman , the president answered
the slave slowly went up to it , and , with a single stroke of the dagger , cut off its head
the usher ’ s brutal monologue , however , came to an end
a crowd of truands followed to provide help or simply to watch
he saw their plumes scattered through the crowd ; they were plunging in , were going to perish ; he sped towards them ; then the vast crown of red plumes closed up , soon they were together again and surrounded him
her wantonness was beginning to bring her in no more than the haberdashery used to ; each new wrinkle meant a crown lost ; she was finding winter hard again , once more she seldom had wood in her grate or bread in her bin
he looked like his own ghost
i wandered aimlessly like you
then as his eyes turned to the palace he saw up at the top the red door with the black cross closing
as soon as the lumps of stone amassed on the outer edge were exhausted , he took more from the heap
such is the charming half-gothic chapter house of boscherville , where the romanesque stratum goes half-way up the body
at least you knew where you were going
she said in a terrible voice , standing up with flashing eyes
now under a bell tower you would catch sight of a huge head and an untidy bundle of limbs swaying furiously on the end of a rope ; it was quasimodo ringing for vespers or the angelus
the spells of which the captain had been the victim seemed to be irresistibly demonstrated , and , in the eyes of all , the gypsy girl , that delightful dancer who had so often dazzled passers-by with her grace , was just a horrible vampire
mâtho , naked as a corpse , was lying prone on a lion skin , his face in his hands ; a hanging lamp shone on his weapons , fastened above his head against the tent pole
he had come that day to spend the night at the bastille
it grew bare , its leaves fell off , it wasted visibly away , it was mean , poor , of no account
first i loved women , then animals
picture to yourself in fact , on this seat of rich cordovan leather , two knock-knees , two skinny thighs shabbily dressed in black woollen knitted hose , a torso wrapped in a fustian cloak with a fur trimming showing more hide than hair ; finally , to crown it all , a greasy old hat of the meanest black cloth with a circular band of lead figurines running round it
his chest heaved with a deep sigh
the crowd was full of admiration
the whole of this little court swooned in their cassocks with ecstasy over this pun
this was indeed all very fine
she is fond of crafty men
she made her scornful little pout , cocked her head like a bird , then burst out laughing , and the dainty little dagger disappeared as it had emerged , without gringoire being able to see where the bee hid its sting
some came to offer him sacks , containing the heads of mercenaries whom they claimed to have killed , but which they had cut from corpses ; for many had got lost as they fled , and they were found dead in various places , under olive trees or in vineyards
they melted in the heat of the candles burning near them ; the paint ran on to their shoulders and tears streamed down the faces of the living , who stood to one side chanting mournful dirges
some said that the republic ’ s treasure had been taken from the temple of moloch : others spoke of a priest murdered
what gypsy with the goat ?
the barbarians slowed down
she ’ s still got it
that is a huge mob of people
maître olivier , marshal de boucicaut used to say : the only good gift comes from the king , the only good fishing from the sea
as well as the fief of tirechappe , he had inherited from his father the fief of the mill , moulin , which was a dependency of the square tower of gentilly
could anyone be more white and fair ?
the low wall surrounding the parvis at waist height would not have sufficed to keep it clear had it not been reinforced by a solid rank of sergeants of the onze-vingts and hackbuteers , culverin in hand
grumbled louis xi , what are you getting at ?
we ’ ve plenty of time
first they licked the clotted blood from still warm stumps of flesh ; and soon they began to devour the corpses , ripping them open at the belly
with careful scrutiny one might further discern within the unintelligible pattern of this network what looked like two outspread wheatsheaves , one in the university , the other in the town , two bundles of broad streets fanning out as they led from the bridges to the gates
the old woman fell silent
the three blocks , city , university , town , veined with countless streets
spiced wine won ’ t pass my lips
they were skilled in such work
he said in a whisper , can it be possible that my life should depend on the slightest vibration of the least of these bells ?
it is ten o ’ clock in the morning
the man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside
it is the hive to which the golden bees of imagination bring their honey
but the archdeacon still protested , objecting that the legate ’ s ordinance , which went back to number , was a hundred and twenty-seven years earlier than the black book , and was consequently , as a matter of fact , abrogated by it
the towers of saint-sulpice are two huge clarinets , a shape as shapes go ; the crooked , grinning telegraph makes a pleasant contrast on their roofline
then , when he was on top , near the corpse , he let it down again
the captain of the bastille walked at their head and had the wickets opened to the sickly , stooping old king , who coughed as he walked
the enormous silhouette of the two towers , extending far over the rooftops of paris , scooped out of all this brightness a broad patch of shadow
a golden point turned through the dust on the road to utica : it was the axle of a chariot harnessed to two mules ; a slave ran at the head of the wagon pole , holding them by the bridle
devil take the canonry !
from the heights of the acropolis the army could be seen swelling in size
there is the paris of catherine de ’ medici at the tuileries , number the paris of henri ii at the hôtel de ville , two buildings still in excellent taste ; the paris of henri iv in the place royale : brick façades with stone quoins and slate roofs , tricolour houses ; the paris of louis xiii at val-de-grâce : a squat , compressed architecture , vaults like basket handles , something paunchy about the columns and humpbacked about the dome ; the paris of louis xiv at the invalides : grand , ornate , gilded and cold ; the paris of louis xv at saint-sulpice : scrolls , knots of ribbon , clouds , vermicelli and chicory , all in stone ; the paris of louis xvi , at the panthéon : a poor copy of saint peter ’ s in rome ( the building has settled awkwardly , which has not improved its lines ) ; the paris of the republic , at the école de medecine : a poor graeco-roman style as much like the coliseum or the parthenon as the constitution of the year iii is like that of minos , in architecture it is known as the messidor style ’ ; the paris of napoleon at the place vendôme : that is quite sublime , a bronze column made from cannon ; the paris of the restoration at the bourse : a very white colonnade supporting a very smooth frieze , the whole is square and cost number million
one night i made an attempt
this titan of art had heaped the pantheon on the parthenon and created st peter ’ s , rome : a great work which deserved to remain unique , architecture ’ s last piece of originality , a giant artist ’ s signature at the bottom of that colossal stone record which then closed
that ’ s in the opposite direction , said the provost
meanwhile jehan frollo raised his fair curly head above the crowd ( climbing on robin poussepain ’ s shoulders to that end ) and cried : come and look , ladies and gentlemen !
i ’ ve still got enough to pay for it
they went in by the jujube hedge , cutting down branches with their daggers
he was puffing like a hippopotamus , rolling his eyes
thus no way was open for avoiding war
however , he was beginning to get tired of coppenole ’ s behaviour , and suddenly turned on him , grinding his teeth so fearfully that the flemish giant retreated , like a bulldog before a cat
however , a wick of tow soaked in oil , burning in an iron cage at the feet of the blessed virgin at the street corner , enabled gringoire to make out the gypsy girl struggling in the arms of two men who were trying to muffle her cries
the mouth no longer eats
they were sacred beasts , whose manes were plaited by the pontiffs with gold ribbons , and who signified by their existence the movement of the sun , the concept of fire in its highest form
a very lively impression of cold in that part of his body which was in contact with the ground all at once woke him up and brought his mind back up to the surface
the more stoic stayed close to each other , sitting in a circle , in the middle of the plain , here and there among the dead ; and wrapped in their cloaks they silently surrendered to their gloom
so , once the vindicte publique [ public vengeance ] was satisfied , as the jurists of our own day still put it in their legal jargon , it was the turn of countless private vengeances
he is procurator to dame gabelle and my lord gibbet
look , phoebus , all this belongs to you , just love me !
in his place any man would have done the same
wretches that we are , that is the name that has ruined us !
no doubt he had some serious reason for not biting into it ( the cake ) , for he contented himself with gazing at it affectionately
the noonday sun gave it horns of fire
however , when our poet saw that calm had been partially restored , he conceived a stratagem which might have saved the day
nevertheless , as they all shared more or less the same degree of beauty , they were competing on an equal footing , and each of them might hope to win
others , empty-handed , gnashed their teeth
the clibanarii stayed outside and , further away , at intervals , stood the elephants
i saw it quite clearly
you must drink a little hippocras and eat this maize cake we ’ ve baked for you
from number the town had spread so far into the suburbs that a new enclosure was needed , especially on the right bank
so she was very unhappy , very miserable , and her cheeks were furrowed with tears
but did they not possess some carthaginians , twenty prisoners taken in the last encounter , whom no one so far had noticed ?
in the gondelaurier mansion it was one of those gala days which precede a wedding
the king looked him straight in the eye and said drily : i understand
he had forgotten at this moment of distress that quasimodo was deaf
godmother fleur-de-lys , come and see what the goat has just done !
our cause is just , we ’ ll sack notre-dame , and that will be that
that line of armoured backs rippling upward in the dark looked like some steel-scaled serpent rising up against the church
but they did not dare to come closer
the numidian king stood apart in a discreet attitude ; on his brow there was a little of the dust he had touched as he prostrated himself
what are you intending to do , by god ’ s horn , with this ladder ?
[ of a monstrous flock a still more monstrous keeper ]
he finally gathered up his courage , advanced on tiptoe , looked , and went in
it is like this latin petition from the nobility of france , asking us to restore what they call the great offices or charges of the crown
each of them was striving to be nearest so that they could be first to rush , once it was open , into this opulent cathedral , a vast repository in which the riches of three centuries had come to be accumulated
this young man with his gentle voice and feminine figure she found captivating to look at because of his personal grace ; he seemed to be a kind of elder sister sent by the baals to protect her
said jupiter , one of the students has just taken the ladder
the wooden screws cracked loudly ; dull thuds echoed ; sometimes a sudden piercing scream rent the air
he pulled mâtho to the far end of the terrace , and showing him the garden where the soldiers ’ swords glinted , hanging up in the trees :
dear lovely lady , i had a row with mané fédy , you know ?
this punishment no doubt terrified the barbarians , because from the height of eschmoûn they were seen striking their tents , collecting their cattle and loading their baggage on to donkeys
the dancer was not playing her tambourine at that moment
dante in the thirteenth century is the last romanesque church ; shakespeare in the sixteenth the last gothic cathedral
some of them were even up on the machicolations of the porte saint-antoine
its monuments are becoming increasingly rare , and they are , as it seems , being gradually swallowed up before our eyes , drowned in the sea of houses
hamilcar stopped when he saw salammbo
replied the gaul as he died
i tell you it wasn ’ t !
cried a toothless voice
but you can speak to me in signs and gestures
behind salammbo tanit ’ s priests , in linen robes , spread out ; the elders , on her right , made a great golden line with their tiaras , and on the other side the rich , with their emerald sceptres , made a great green line , while , right at the back , where the priests of moloch were drawn up , their mantles looked like a wall of purple
at the sound of this childish voice , clear , fresh , resonant , the recluse started
so she returned to her garret in the rue folle-peine , full of pride at bringing home a queen
then , if you looked along the bank from east to west , from the tournelle to the tour de nesle , there ran a long string of houses with carved beams , coloured windows , overhanging the pavement with one storey projecting above another , an endless zigzag of comfortable citizens ’ gables , cut frequently by the end of some street , and also now and then by the front or angle of some great stone mansion , ensconced comfortably with its courtyards and gardens , its wings and main buildings , amid this rabble of cramped , narrow houses like some great lord amid a mob of yokels
in fact hamilcar had ordered the phalanx to break its sections , and the elephants , light troops and cavalry to pass through these gaps and rapidly move over to the flanks ; he had so well calculated the barbarians ’ distance that just as they came up against him , the entire carthaginian army formed a long straight line
the crescent moon , stranded amid the clouds , seemed like some heavenly ship caught in these aerial ice-floes
you are cold , the darkness makes you blind , the dungeon envelops you , but perhaps you still have some light in your innermost depths , even if it is only your childish love for that hollow man who toyed with your-heart !
i ’ ve only just arrived
do not be afraid !
it ’ s a fine thing to be the man
it ’ s still a j , said the cheeky , red-faced , cheerful student
he walked on , the shadow walked on
from above he could see the truands , triumphant and furious , shaking their fists at the shadowy façade , and he envied , for the gypsy and for himself , the wings of the owls who were flying away in flocks over his head
but to make the walls more accessible , the retrenchment round the ditch was knocked down
the elephants swung their bleeding trunks between the stakes of their pens
just think that i hold our two destinies in my hand , that i am out of my mind—this is dreadful—that i may let everything fall , and that beneath us is a bottomless abyss , unhappy girl , down which my fall will follow yours through all eternity !
she cried , my phoebus !
the way down to it was by a low door and stairs as steep and rigid as a classical alexandrine
after all the faces , pentagonal , hexagonal , and irregular , which had succeeded each other at the window without ever achieving the grotesque ideal that imaginations fevered by the orgy had composed , it took nothing less to carry their vote than the sublime grimace which had just dazzled the assembly
abdalonim shuddered every time he saw him go near the parks
he did not have a vertical wall to deal with , but one sloping away under him
round her head , in her black tresses , were metal plates sparkling in the sun and forming on her brow a starry crown
here and there one shone out above the others like a flag among spearheads
the tarentines quickly jumped from their horses to their second ones , and went off to right and left towards the river and the town
he laid the mattress out over the stone floor , and said : sleep
wouldn ’ t your majesty like him to be kept in a cage for a bit ?
at its front section a cylinder , fitted with cables , held a large beam carrying a scoop for projectiles ; its base was fastened by a skein of twisted strands , and when the ropes were released , it rose up , striking against the bar , which , halting it with a jerk , increased its force
he offered to send for some from carthage ; then , like the others , they accepted money
they burned in the dark , here and there , like beacons half-hidden in the mist ; and nothing was to be seen moving on the plain but the rippling of the river , swollen with corpses which it was carrying to the sea
i want to know all about it
i ’ ll tear out your horrid grey hair in handfuls and throw it in your face
they have only to come here
narr ’ havas tilted his chin as a sign of disdain ; there was not one measure which he did not judge disastrous ; and he no longer smiled
but a portcullis , forty cubits high , made to fit the gap exactly , suddenly came down before them , like a rampart falling from the sky
someone had shattered it
is she your gypsy ?
its elemental atoms pour and stream continuously over the world in infinite currents
i ’ m told he is an archdeacon ’ s bastard and born of the devil
if you do not see me , come back to carthage on the first day of each month
you run in the blue of your sky and i stay motionless upon the earth
dear reader , it is pierre gringoire and his prologue
his big brother counted on a pious , docile , learned , honourable pupil
at last the baal arrived right in the middle of the square
she murmured , and felt rough hands taking her away
there was a kind of sham soldier , narquois as they are called in argot , whistling as he unwound the dressing from his sham wound , and stretching his sound , healthy knee , wrapped up since morning in countless bindings ; as the other side of the coin , a malingreux was getting his god ’ s leg ’ ready for the morning with celandine and ox-blood
this cooling-off is almost imperceptible in the fifteenth century , the printing press is as yet too feeble , and at the most draws off from mighty architecture some of its superfluous vigour
how can you ask , adorable esmeralda ?
the steeple of saint-sulpice and the three tall spires of saint-germain-des-prés rose above the horizon to his right
they dragged after them some kind of shapeless sack ; and were making enough noise with their clogs alone to wake the dead
the great machine , as though lifted convulsively , went forward perhaps ten paces : but the ground was becoming softer and softer , the mud came up to the axles and the helepolis stopped with a fearful list to one side
they came round to talking about the situation , and to lessen his fault or restore his own courage , spendius maintained that there was still hope
all , from a distance , looked at each other with their great wild eyes
he resembled them too closely for that
he was woken out of his almost lyrical ecstasy by a great double petard suddenly exploding from the blessed cabin
what have they given us in place of it all , all that gaulish history , all that gothic art ?
but what was the point , then , of breaking that poor pitcher ?
through the enthusiasm of some and the pusillanimity of others , before the time laid down , an army of five thousand men was ready
and the remedy , compère ?
they did not know however by what means they could go
rose the cry on every side
the gods were obviously declaring against carthage
haven ’ t you a single parisis left ?
then , every evening , on the pretext of some devotion , the elders went up to the temple and feasted in secret ; and they brought back under their tunics a bit for their children
what instantly struck our friend jehan ( who , as one might expect , had so disposed himself in his corner that he could see and hear everything just as he wished ) was the absolute dreariness of the newcomer ’ s dress and features
olivier , settle the matter with monsieur d ’ estouteville , and this very evening make the preparations for marrying this rascal to a gallows
it was the same crowd on the terraces , the same looks , the same anger ; but then he was walking free , everyone drew aside , a god covered him ; and this memory , gradually becoming more precise , brought him shattering sorrow
meanwhile guillaume rym , with his crafty smile , went up to the usher :
on their chests were what looked like white butterflies ; it was the tufts of the arrows which had been shot at them from below
so i ate some too
he had only kept on his military tunic , and the bronze plates tore into the purple covering of the couch
why am i not made of stone like you !
throughout the march he stayed near mâtho ; he brought him food , helped him dismount , each evening spread a rug under his head
i prefer my yellow and red surcoat to those iron and steel scales
but once he had set them swinging , when he felt this cluster of bells move beneath his hand , when he saw , for he could not hear , the palpitating octave go up and down on this scale of sound like a bird hopping from branch to branch , when the musical devil , that demon who shakes a dazzling bunch of stretti , trills , and arpeggios , had taken possession of the poor deaf creature , then he became happy again , he forgot everything , and his swelling heart brought a beam to his face
at this point another soldier arrived , shouting : my lord , the old hag is lying
some had even blindfolded themselves , and their swords swept gently through the air like blind men ’ s sticks
the book of architecture belonged no more to the priesthood , religion , rome , but to imagination , poetry , the people
the flogging was over
the look was fixed , yet turbulent and stormy
we shall say , then , that quasimodo loved the archdeacon as no dog , no horse , no elephant ever loved its master
she opened her eyes
you won ’ t have me as your slave , so you ’ ll have me as your master
dusk fell ; clouds piled up above the baal
so be it , said the poet
it looked as though the walls crammed with people were crumbling under the screams of horror and mystic pleasure
now all the country squires for thirty leagues around were soliciting this favour for their daughters , and a good many of them had already brought or sent the girls to paris
the seine runs very fast at that spot , and he had some trouble clearing the tip of the island
and just to think that these people had been on the point of rebellion against monsieur the bailiff , so impatient were they to hear his work !
he still kept on , however , and each step he took increased the rage , but the terror too
the outside world seemed much further away to him than to us
the dolt , jehan frollo du moulin said to his friend robin poussepain ( for the two students had followed the victim , as might be expected ) ; he doesn ’ t understand any more than a cockchafer shut up in a box !
finally he pictured to himself the girl wearing a shift , a rope round her neck , shoulders bare , feet bare , almost naked , as he had seen her on that last day
it was the goat that had just arrived in search of its mistress and , as it rushed towards her , had begun by getting its horns caught in the pile of material which the noble lady ’ s clothes heaped up over her feet when she was sitting down
and between these men , lying on the ground in the cypress avenue , the steward of stewards , abdalonim , wearing a white mitre , came towards hamilcar , a censer in his hand
he repeated , jangling his spurs , no doubt your dress is a bit eccentric and wild ; but with a girl as charming as you , what does that matter ?
in number nicolas flamel had built for them , over the vaulting of saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie , a room which cost him number livres number sols number deniers parisis
you are going to hang this man ?
at last a crack was heard ; a huge stone , rebounding on the lower arches , rolled to the bottom , and suddenly a cataract , a whole river fell from the sky on to the plain
to return to notre-dame
we can even form a phalanx , let us return !
this , he thought , was a ruse to gain time
all these circumstances , two centuries later , seemed so ridiculous to the court , as sauval says , that they were served up as a pastime to the king and an introduction to the royal ballet night , divided into four parts and danced at the petit-bourbon theatre
solus cum sola non cogitabuntur orare pater noster [ a man and a woman alone together will not be assumed to be saying the our father ]
but you look pretty powerful , and it ’ s safer to put off the contest until tomorrow
it was on this re-entrant angle that the wretched archdeacon was exhausting himself
and , on the right , that crocodile ?
the priest looked at her and did not answer ; she repeated her question
let me be , monsieur le capitaine !
it was peopled by marble figures , kings , saints , bishops , who at least did not burst out laughing in his face and looked on him only with serenity and benevolence
it was an alphabet with each letter separately inscribed on a little boxwood block
the slaves of the council struck him with their hippopotamus hide whips , so furiously and so long that the fringes of their tunics were soaked with sweat
the bushes , plunged in darkness , gave off warm , honeyed scents
after a few minutes the worried archdeacon emerged into the square by the door at the bottom of the tower
spin the rope for the hangman
she stopped people passing by and cried : my daughter !
first , the flight of eleven steps which once raised it above ground level ; then the lower series of statues which occupied the niches in the three doorways ; and lastly the upper series of the twenty-eight earliest kings of france , which filled the first-floor gallery , from childebert to philip-augustus , each holding in his hand the imperial apple ’
night fell ; broad bands of red streaked the western sky
he said , hands clasped together , our lady of paris , my gracious patroness , forgive me
he was indeed no longer at the window
they blackened their cheeks ; cut off their hair ; drew their own blood and poured it into the pits ; they cut themselves in imitation of the wounds disfiguring the dead
she saw the dagger strike down at phoebus and come up again reeking
murmured the priest , pressing his lips to her shoulders
this was an endless cause of quarrels , and arguments , many enticing the companions of the others with the lure or promise of their ration
on top of the aqueduct they saw a man in a torn , brown tunic
alas , what have you got against me ?
we shall send it , said the king with a false appearance of seriousness
gringoire was enraptured at feeling , seeing , fingering , so to speak , a whole assembly ( of the baser sort , true , but what does that matter ? )
some said they had seen her leave reims at dusk by the porte fléchembault ; others at dawn by the old porte basée
he needed some proof , some divine manifestation , and in the hope of obtaining it the priest thought of an enterprise which could save both his country and his faith
clopin came up to him , put the noose round his neck and clapped him on the shoulder : goodbye , friend !
they say a woman is on trial for murdering a soldier
indeed , master , he answered with a respectful smile , all the great philosophers have had their familiar animal
screeched an old woman in the crowd below the window
he said with an innocent look , as if it was the first time he had thought of it , guillaume de harancourt , the friend of monsieur the cardinal balue
there was no way to resist the rising tide of frightening faces
he stirred up all the hatred , all the malice in his innermost heart , and recognized , with the cool eye of a physician examining a patient , that this hatred and malice was nothing but vitiated love ; that love , source of every human virtue , could , in a priest ’ s heart , turn into something horrible , and that a man constituted like him , by becoming a priest became a devil
next day her hair had gone grey
monsieur the bishop of verdun
thus the gypsy ’ s reception was extraordinarily glacial
to get rid of it !
what have i done to you ?
what a graceful animal , no doubt more notable for her cleanliness than her size , but ingenious , subtle , and as well lettered as a grammarian !
he had descended into proserpine ’ s caves ; he had seen the five hundred columns of the labyrinth at lemnos turn and the candelabra at tarentum blazing in all its splendour , with as many lamps on its stem as there are days in the year ; sometimes at night he had greeks in to ask them questions
he gives everything to his doctor
continuing up the successive levels of this amphitheatre of palaces unfolding in the distance over the ground , after crossing a deep ravine cut through the roofs of the town , which marked the line of the rue saint-antoine , the eye reached—and we are still confining ourselves to the principal monuments—the logis d ’ angoulême , a vast structure from several different periods , some parts of which were quite new and very white , blending with the whole scarcely better than a red patch on a blue doublet
monsieur the bailiff is our friend
where glass had been broken from the pretty rose-window it had left open a stone circle through which , it was agreed , the contestants would stick their heads
salammbo stayed still looking at him , with bowed head and folded hands
the barbarians , as though abandoning him , closed up together ; and there was no word , no complaint
where could the carthaginians be going ?
from time to time salammbo approached its silver-wire basket ; she drew aside the purple curtain , the lotus leaves , the birds ’ down ; it stayed constantly rolled up , stiller than a withered creeper ; and from looking at it she ended by feeling a kind of spiral in her heart , like another serpent slowly coming up into her throat to choke her
but they went so confidently that the carthaginians felt bolder and mingled with the soldiers , who were overwhelmed with promises and embraces
the medley of arms was only equalled by that of clothes and peoples
hiero , who governed at syracuse , was swayed by this example
the appearance of the square , the sight astir there , the disorder of this night attack , the hideous crowd , hopping up and down like a horde of frogs , dimly spied in the darkness , the hoarse croaking of this multitude , the few red torches speeding along and passing each other against the background of shadow , like the fires to be seen at night streaking over the misty surface of marshes , the whole scene looked to her like some mysterious battle being waged between the phantoms of a witches ’ sabbath and the stone monsters of the church
he began by looking round the crowd threateningly
many deserted them in advance on the pretext of some business or delicacy they were going to buy ; the servants of moloch came along and took the children
the word signed ’ is in the text
a naked sword leaned against a stool , beside a shield ; hippopotamus-hide whips , cymbals , bells , necklets were strewn about on woven baskets ; crumbs of black bread spotted a felt blanket ; in a corner , on a round stone , copper money was carelessly piled up , and through tears in the canvas the wind brought the dust from outside with the smell of the elephants , who could be heard eating as they rattled their chains
meanwhile arrows spurted out from the top of the wooden towers and the stone ones
all that was to be seen was a very splendid folding armchair : the wood was painted with roses on a red background , the seat was of scarlet cordovan leather , decorated with long silver fringes and studded with countless gold nails
mâtho filled the gaps with stones from the houses
there are moments when a woman ’ s hands have superhuman strength
notre-dame de paris is not of pure roman stock like the first , nor of pure arab stock like the second
tunis above all execrated carthage !
he was fidgeting with impatience : he pressed mâtho ; and blinking his eyes , as though at the approach of a target which he had aimed at for a long time :
my lord , said henriet , do you call that a woman ?
phoebus answered and his passionate gaze accompanied the ring of sincerity in his voice to convince fleur-de-lys
those simple words brought down the sword glinting in the captain ’ s hand
after all , concedo , i grant that it ’ s a poor way to use my intellectual faculties , and that man was not made to spend his life banging a tambourine and biting chairs
but he demanded that ten of the mercenaries , of his choice , should be handed over to him , without arms or tunics
] ’ cried the students
all this active , organized , tranquil life , reproduced around him in countless forms , upset him
olivier opened his mouth to answer : sire … ’
besides , the birth of daughters was regarded as a calamity in the sun religions
qui non laborat non manducet
my name is pierre gringoire
magistri asserts that there are certain women ’ s names so sweet and so mysterious that it is enough to pronounce them during the operation … let ’ s read what manou says about it : where women are honoured , the divinities are overjoyed ; where they are despised , it is no use praying to god
but carthage was defended across the whole width of the isthmus : first by a ditch , then by a turf rampart , finally by a wall , thirty cubits in dressed stone , and double storied
she did not , however , lose all presence of mind : they ’ ve always been like that , she stammered
then lifting his hand over the gypsy he cried in a funereal voice :
cried the archdeacon from inside the cell , i was expecting you
the day must surely come when in france there will be only one king , one lord , one judge , one headsman , just as in paradise there is only one god !
she fed the child herself , made it swaddling clothes out of her blanket , the only one she had on her bed , and no longer felt cold or hunger
but what kept them alive was love of life
at the same time , as if an invisible hand had lifted the weight which had for so long been holding down the tears in her heart , she began to weep ; and as the tears flowed , she felt all that was most sharp and bitter in her grief going away with them
it had to be a child , because only a child could be innocent enough
very good , said gringoire
are they in force ?
the truands are good lads…
come along , quick there !
they were piled in a compact mass
he had learned from their remarks that his bride of the broken pitcher had found refuge in notre-dame , and he was very glad she had
suddenly dom claude rose , took a compass and silently incised on the wall in capital letters the greek word : ’ anáγkh
the speaker could not be seen
cried the captain , you can ’ t go off like that
he stayed walled up like this for several weeks
she was very frightened by the gypsy women and cried
the building has a thousand storeys
when he was half-way up the ladder he cast a melancholy glance down on the poor dead argoteers strewn over the steps
gradually people came to the end of the avenues ; they hurled into the flames pearls , gold vases , cups , torches , all their wealth ; the offerings became more and more splendid and numerous
they had come to reims to tell fortunes in the name of the king of algiers and the emperor of germany
muttered gringoire , am i going to be too hot now ?
the bailiff ’ s four sergeants still stood there , stiff and motionless as four painted statues
crossing the petit-pont , and striding over the rue neuve-sainte-geneviève , jehan de molendino found himself in front of notre-dame
i don ’ t mind other mothers having children , i don ’ t care about them now
the unfortunate captain was obliged to stay
it is what will enable me to find my family again if i remain worthy of it
a small door , no doubt giving access to a neighbouring cell , was being closed from the outside
at this , bursting into sobs and looking up at the priest : oh !
the night was dark , a grey mist seemed to hang heavily on the sea , which beat against the cliff with a noise of sobs and dying breaths ; and shadows gradually disappeared as though they had passed through the walls
you know , master , the secret of good health , according to hippocrates , id est cibi , potus , somnii , venus , omnia moderata sint [ that is , all things in moderation , food , drink , sleep , venus ]
i don ’ t feel comfortable with you looking at me
that memory , effaced by his other adventures that evening , came back to him
he went on with a smile : it was a most agreeable sight
but the guilty will be punished !
mademoiselle de gondelaurier knew how her mother ’ s outdated way of speaking grated on the captain
it became an egg
i can ’ t see you making the slightest noise—what are those bronze mouths that look as though they are yawning when it ’ s singing that ’ s wanted ?
may beelzebub strangle you !
a building is no longer a building , it is a polyhedron
hamilcar ’ s demands would be cruel
and the deans ’ spittoons !
she cried , hands clasped , down on her knees , dishevelled , distraught , wild with fright , madame !
the suffete was wise enough not to pursue them
schahabarim remembered hamilcar ’ s orders ; he replied :
he closed his door to everyone , even the bishop
listen , dom claude , the poet replied in consternation , you are keen on this idea , and you ’ re wrong
the girl was surrounded with such an aura of chastity , such a spell of virtue , that phoebus did not feel wholly at ease with her
statues , stained glass , rose-windows , arabesques , indentations , capitals , bas-reliefs : all such objects of imagination can be combined according to whichever logarithm is appropriate
all the more reason for getting our sister out of his clutches , the old gypsy answered
every civilization begins with theocracy and ends up with democracy
in the dark at that height , it produced a peculiar effect , and the good women would say : there ’ s the archdeacon at his bellows , hell ’ s sparking up there
the walk brought her some relief , so calm did the earth appear seen from that height
during this time , since the stones had ceased to fall , the truands had stopped looking upwards
the king , you say !
they are the hieroglyphs of feudalism , following those of theocracy
with one leap he clung to it , stiffening his arms , levering with his feet ; and at last the enormous sections came partly open
that is because at that time every building was an idea
in the compliments dom claude paid to jacques coictier there was a sardonic , sour note of subdued derision , the sad , cruel smile of an unhappy but superior person amusing himself for a moment by playing with the solid prosperity of a vulgar man
one only comes out from the cavern with white hair , but only enters it with hair still black
when you cried out i dug it into my flesh ; if you had cried a second time it would have gone into my heart !
you will be married to brand new gallows !
dom claude listened in silence
all the leaders of all the ranks appeared between long sharp weapons which overlapped them unevenly , for the first six ranks crossed their long lances , holding them in the middle , and the ten ranks behind rested them on the shoulders of the companions standing successively in front
although they disfigure and clutter up the place , says sauval in despair , our old men will not get rid of them and keep them in spite of everyone
they stopped at the bottom of the catacombs , in the first pools of the lagoon
salammbo imagined that it was out of a sense of shame for the defeated goddess , and calling her by a common name designating the moon , she poured out blessings on the sweet and fertile star
he went no further than tunis , and shut himself up in its walls
the newcomer understood , and began in a low voice to give a most terrified account , to which the king listened quite calmly , while guillaume rym pointed out to coppenole the face and dress of the newcomer , his fur-trimmed hood , caputia fourrata , his short cloak , epitogia curta , his black velvet robe , which indicated a president of the court of accounts
however , their conversation was becoming increasingly animated
in fact the republic , exhausted by war , had allowed all the returning troops to accumulate in the city
the great poem , the great building , the great work of mankind will no longer be built , it will be printed
my daughter , my daughter !
the steward-of-stewards , after a long bow , went on :
two women were sitting in the chariot
she sent back the answer that she must not receive him
people thought he was ill indeed he was
such fertile land and such ingenious inventions dazzled them
an old maid becomes a young mother
the girl looked at him in alarm : hate me !
you are the only one to have given the play a proper hearing
you have been told , master ! … ’
come now , gringoire went on , getting more and more worked up , and thinking that after all he was only dealing with a court of miracles virtue , am i not yours , sweetheart ?
in the fourth dilochy of the twelfth syntagma , three soldiers knifed each other to death fighting over a rat
brother , the duke of egypt said then , placing his hands on their foreheads , she is your wife ; sister , he is your husband
let me take the other one , madame ; that is the wish of monsieur the provost
resting on one arm , and taking careful aim , he would hurl his weapon
sometimes the rain from a storm hung down from the heavens like a long sash , while the whole countryside was covered by calm blue skies ; then a warm wind whipped up swirls of dust – and a stream came tumbling down from the heights on which sicca stood , with its golden roof on bronze pillars , the temple of the carthaginian venus , who dominated the region
the king listened in silence
besides , mâtho was observing him , and to cover up his cowardice , he made a show of anger in which he was gradually caught himself
numerous arms were raised and he disappeared from view
he had recognized the rabbet ’ s influence , being skilled in distinguishing which gods sent down illnesses ; and to cure salammbo he had her apartment sprinkled with verbena and maidenhair ; every morning she ate mandragora ; she slept with her head on a sachet of perfumes blended by the pontiffs ; he had even used baaras , a flame-coloured root which drives away evil spirits to the north ; finally , turning towards the pole star , he murmured three times the mysterious name of tanit ; but as salammbo ’ s sickness continued , his anxiety intensified
several had boldly refused ; and , determined neither to feed them nor surrender them to the grand council , he had dismissed them , ordering them not to fight again against carthage
yes , opposite the chapel of braque
he baptized his adopted child , and named him quasimodo , either because he wanted thereby to indicate the day on which he had found him , or because he wanted to signify by that name the degree to which the poor little creature was unfinished and incomplete
the wretched prisoner judged that the king was going from the fact that the torches and noise were growing more distant
djali , said the dancer , now it ’ s your turn
in the darkness of the spiral stairs his elbow bumped into something which withdrew with a grunt ; he presumed it was quasimodo , and found that so funny that he went down the rest of the stairs holding his sides with laughter
it was a glittering cavalcade , and made the roadway ring
the suffete replied disdainfully
the face of europe has changed
cried phoebus , the worthy man !
from the great shadows which fell on all sides in wide patches he realized that the hangings from that morning ’ s ceremony had not yet been taken down
then the clamour was renewed , at regular intervals , obstinately
in a moment the chapel was full of contestants and the door was closed behind them
right , i say , it ’ ll take me more than a couple of weeks to wash that floor clean
hanno , the victor , presented himself before the gates of utica
an onyx step surrounded an oval basin ; delicate snakeskin slippers remained at the edge with an alabaster pitcher
she signed to him to stay
certes ce fut un triste jeu ,
he thought that what he heard banging together in the shadows was the bundle of skeletons at montfaucon
they make one feel how primitive a thing architecture is by demonstrating , as the cyclopean remains , egyptian pyramids , gigantic hindu temples also demonstrate , that architecture ’ s greatest productions are not so much the works of individuals as of societies ; the fruit of whole peoples in labour rather than the inspiration of men of genius ; the deposit left by a nation ; the accumulation of centuries ; the residue from successive evaporations of human society ; in a word , types of formation
there was soon no wood left for the bonfires , the flames went out , all the places were filled ; and weary from crying , weak and staggering they fell asleep beside their dead brothers , those who wanted to live full of anxiety , the others not wanting to wake up
because the word espérance which is written over the great doorway was all lit up with magic glasses
as they had declared the lists to be untruthful , he did not use them
and then cast me to the demon for all eternity !
the terraces , fortifications , walls disappeared beneath the crowds of carthaginians , dressed in black
however , if these haudriettes were for the moment observing pierre d ’ ailly ’ s statutes , they were certainly transgressing to their hearts ’ content those of michel de brache and the cardinal of pisa which so harshly laid down silence for them
meanwhile the mud was getting deeper and deeper
you can see very well that she doesn ’ t know what she is doing
then she began to sing of the adventures of melkarth , god of the sidonians and father of her family
just three hundred and forty-eight years , six months , and nineteen days ago today parisians woke to the sound of all the bells pealing out within the triple precinct of city , university , and town
but he ’ s the one who married us , the poet timidly observed
she put a finger to her lip and hid the amulet in her bosom
diane and colombe eagerly spoke to the gypsy
he coughed and continued :
but gisco might return and , encircling the suburb which extended to the outer ramparts , crush them against the walls
the two animals , side by side , were now trotting , with their hooves muffled as they sank into the sand
from the smiles , the little signs of complicity of madame aloïse , the winks she directed at her daughter fleur-de-lys as she spoke quietly to the captain , it was obvious that the subject at issue was some betrothal already confirmed , some marriage doubtless forthcoming , between the young man and fleur-de-lys
she must get out of there , all the same !
it used to be solid , now it has become long-lived
no , the shot would make a noise !
can ’ t you see , sister , that the little monster is at least number years old , and would find your teats much less appetizing than something off the spit
an impartial look at the old magistracy
by the pope ’ s whiskers !
she covered her eyes in horror
a drop of water and a little pity , that ’ s more than i could repay with my life
and doubts arose in the barbarian ’ s mind
she refused the blessing of her waters , she had abandoned carthage ; she was a deserter , an enemy
the witch is under the safeguard of the church , the church is under my safeguard
it is the second tower of babel of the human race
they only marched at night ; hiding by day in olive groves
the heavy tapestry shook , and above the cord holding it up the python ’ s head appeared
he thus passed round the montagne sainte-geneviève , and finally left the town by the porte saint-victor
he began by setting down in one corner of the pillory a black hourglass , whose upper cup was filled with red sand which filtered through to the lower one
i heard the eight singing-men of the king of sicily intone the opening verse of the seven o ’ clock high mass from the sainte-chapelle
the husbands thought of rapine , the wives of rape , and they all trembled
i ’ ve got my daughter !
as for narr ’ havas , he was to return to his kingdom to collect elephants and make cavalry sweeps over the roads
pride always has ruin and shame hot on its heels
with the tip of his finger hamilcar counted them one after another ; then he hid his face under a saffron coloured veil , and falling on his knees he stretched out on the ground , with both arms extended
pour me a drink !
what became of la chantefleurie ?
immense revulsion overwhelmed them
it was the ranks of the barbarians
compère , retorted louis xi , do you think it ’ s for birds like him that we have cages made costing number limes number sols number deniers—release the whoremonger right away ’ ( louis xi was fond of that word , which with pasque-dieu !
the mother burst out laughing , flew up the stairs as if she had wings and crashed the door open as though with a cannonball , and went in
the people of tunis came up ; they brought along those of utica
compère tristan , here ’ s a man for you
you acknowledge yourself to be a member of the franche-bourgeoisie ?
besides , it was the day following a holiday , a tiresome day for everyone , and above all for the magistrate responsible for clearing all the rubbish , literal and figurative , left by a holiday in paris
finally , you admit and confess to having , with the help of the demon , and the phantom commonly known as the bogey-monk , on the night of number march past , murdered and assassinated a captain named phoebus de châteaupers ?
he began to smile a horrible smile : they won ’ t believe you—you would only be adding a scandal to a crime—answer quickly !
and a fine one at that !
he roared with laughter like a madman
now quasimodo could see him distinctly
his appearances in his good town of paris were only ever brief and rare , because he did not feel that there were enough trapdoors , gallows , and scottish archers around him there
they proceeded to vote without leaving the hall
poor child , whose life up till then had been so joyful , so smooth , so sweet , the first pain had overcome her
in the seventeenth century the printing press is already sufficiently supreme , sufficiently triumphant , sufficiently secure in its victory to entertain the world to a great age of literature
muttered phoebus , targes , grands blancs , petits blancs , mailles at a tournois for two , deniers parisis , real liards with the eagle !
he hurried thus across country until evening
everyone had long since given him up for lost ; so much so that , on learning of his victory , they experienced a feeling of stupefaction amounting almost to terror
an enormous egg hung by a thread from her navel , and she fell down over the other wall , head first , to the level of the flagged floor , where her pointed fingers reached
who is it they call the good god , then ?
carry on , he said stoically
but their unprotected bodies made them easy to wound , and the carthaginians massacred them in large numbers ; and the mercenaries were glad , doubtless from jealousy about looting
he took the name of the father in vain
thought gringoire : you don ’ t have dreams of glory and you don ’ t write epithalamia !
this outburst made him feel a bit better , and a kind of reddish reflection which he noticed just then at the end of a long , narrow alley completed the restoration of his morale
a galley anchored on the libyan sand , it maintained its position by sheer hard work
meanwhile mâtho sat on the ground , in the same spot where he had found himself when the battle had ended , elbows on knees , head in hands ; he saw nothing , heard nothing , had stopped thinking
the rich , the elders , the women , the whole crowd , were massed behind the priests and on the terraces of the houses
one night he went in
what have you done to me , gypsy woman !
it seems that they had formerly been saracens , which means they believed in jupiter , and they claimed number livres tournois from all archbishops , bishops , and abbots with cross and mitre
women went round with wineskins on their heads , bleating goats roamed around under the stacks of pikes ; sentries were relieved , they ate around tripods
it seemed to the young man that there was only one purpose in life : knowledge
yes , he said , as though talking to himself , he must surely be dead
all right , i will give you land , and land you will never leave !
the tumult increased ; some captains entered
his eyes went in turn from the zaïmph to her , and he noticed that her chain was broken
an odd name for a gentleman !
is it absolutely necessary to make you happy that i should be hanged ?
they no longer left each other
and without another word he emptied the wallet on to a marker-stone nearby with the air of a roman saving his country
usher , the cardinal said aloud , announce maître jacques coppenole , clerk to the échevins of the illustrious town of ghent
they are gilded and they don ’ t show the time ; and the hands can do without them
sometimes for several days she refused to speak
but what have i done ?
then they all rushed on the food , lying flat on their bellies
his arms fell , and he bowed his head , overwhelmed by a sudden reverie
the rabble has been put down
so you deny the influence of philtres on the blood , of unguents on the flesh !
the kings of france have always had wild beasts roaring round their thrones
finally in the evening , like a stone coming away from the cliff , suddenly a baldrick fell from above
his belt was crammed with daggers and poniards , he had a great sword by his side , a rusty crossbow on his left , and a huge jug of wine in front of him , not to mention a thick-set , dishevelled girl on his right
then , rejuvenated by fury , he began striding up and down
the tile kiln lay further away , and the rue du four which led to the communal oven [ four ] , and the mill on its mound , and the leper house , an isolated little building shunned by all
they went down the acropolis
the judges voted by raising their caps , they were in a hurry
hangings and caparisons of every kind ; some of damask , fine cloth of gold , trimmed with sable fur ; others of velvet , trimmed with ermine ; others again covered with jewellery and great gold and silver bells !
for the rest the prodigious edifice remains always unfinished
meanwhile the road stretched out endlessly
the beggar turned round ; surprise , recognition , broad smiles on the two faces , etc
but from the direction of the rocks came a cracking noise ; and the highest , after rocking on its base , came bouncing down
the soldiers ’ indignation , kept under control as long as he was speaking , burst out like a storm : they wanted to massacre the guards and the suffete
the bravest ones had soon joined the mercenaries
compère tourangeau watched him in silence
he did not appear at chapter conferences , nor at services
a balearic slinger took a step forward , put one of his clay shot in his sling , swung his arm ; an ivory shield shattered , and the two armies clashed
she murmured , this is the moment when one should die !
i took it , and left off my old black smock , which for a hermetist like me was not at all hermetically closed
and the cooks , wine-servants , grooms , runners , litter-bearers , bath-attendants , women and children , all drew up in a single line in the garden , from the counting-house to the wild beasts ’ park
above all if it is the shoe for special occasions , sundays , christening , the shoe embroidered even under the sole , a shoe in which the child has not yet taken a step
it was the abuse of impunity side by side with the abuse of punishment , two evils each trying to correct one another
after all , there ’ s nothing to worry about
that ’ ll teach you to wear gold belts !
there are lots of ways
for a good month now no one had known what had happened to la esmeralda , much to the distress of the duke of egypt and his friends the truands , or to the goat , which intensified gringoire ’ s grief
i think indeed , phoebus replied , that it ’ s not far off noon
it ’ s that horrid gypsy girl with the goat !
the only witnesses to the first were the three women whose acquaintance the reader has just made ; the spectators of the second were all the people whom we saw earlier , collecting in the place de grève around the pillory and the gibbet
the key was in the lock
her mother doted on her more fondly every day
thus it was that little by little , always developing in tune with the cathedral , living , sleeping there , almost never leaving it , subject at every moment to its mysterious pressures , he came to resemble it , to be encrusted on it , so to speak , to become an integral part of it
said the sachette in a strange voice : and will you make a bit too for the poor little girl who ’ s been under the ground for the past fifteen years ?
it ’ s quasimodo , the bell-ringer !
the bandits , panting like a pack of hounds hunting the boar down in his lair , were crowding tumultuously round the great door , battered out of shape by the ram , but still standing
said clopin , gruffly displeased , i don ’ t want to come after anyone
this was clearly a meeting between master and disciple
what he loved above all in the maternal building , what awoke his soul to spread out the poor wings which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern , were the bells
when , while still only small , he dragged himself tortuously and jerkily beneath the gloom of its vaults he seemed with his human face and animal ’ s limbs to be the native reptile of the damp and sombre paving over which the shadows of the romanesque capitals cast so many strange shapes
it was not that phoebus ’ wound had been anything but serious , but it had been less serious than the archdeacon was pleased to think
as they were all guilty , each of them soon felt reassured ; and gradually , turning their back on the suffete , they went down again , raging in their humiliation
he talked as he dreamed , back resting against a scarlet cushion ; his head fell back a little , and his small arm , thrust out from his body , remained quite straight in an imperious attitude
he had a mania for preventing curious spectators from coming anywhere near
it appeared ; spendius raised his arms and cried out
pierre l ’ assommeur [ slaughterman ] and baptiste croque-oison [ chaw-gosling ]
at last the rams broke down the gate of khamon and that of tagaste
meanwhile the bulls were wandering loose , those which the carthaginians had released into the gorge to attract the barbarians
the general , without pausing , hit him on the head with his heavy ivory baton : the barbarian fell
while he let his solitary eye drift over this misty , dark horizon , the bell-ringer felt within himself an inexpressible disquiet
wounded in the knees , they had been seized and bound with ropes , and the ends of the heavy chains on their hands dragged along the floor
he noticed the captives , and then roaring with laughter : ha , ha !
war was enough of a burden !
said salammbo , no , i do love you !
he felt lost amid all that grandeur
but we haven ’ t forgotten the old proverb : the fairest county is flanders ; the fairest duchy , milan ; the fairest kingdom , france—is that not so , messieurs the flemings ?
just as he was casually tying up his laces again , his head in the clouds , he saw the shadow approaching slowly , so slowly that he had plenty of time to observe that this shadow wore a cloak and a hat
she pounced on it , but soon became motionless again
he saw her again , undressed by the brutal hands of the torturers , letting them strip and then fix in the iron-screwed boot her little foot , her slender , shapely leg , her supple , white knee
all the details of her dismal adventure , from the nocturnal scene at la falourdel ’ s down to her condemnation at the tournelle came back to her mind all at once , not vague and confused as they had been up till then , but distinct , raw , clear-cut , lifelike , terrible
without a word she approached the victim who twisted about in vain to escape her , and taking a gourd from off her belt , she gently brought it to the poor wretch ’ s parched lips
upon my soul , went on gringoire , i can see the blind watching and the lame running ; but where is the saviour ?
from morning to night the troops paraded through the streets with their weapons ; the sound of trumpets was constantly to be heard ; carts passed by with shields , tents , pikes ; the courtyards were full of women tearing up cloth ; the enthusiasm was contagious ; hamilcar ’ s soul filled the republic
a common enemy had just arrived ; they all felt it , they all rallied together
meanwhile the pay-out continued , and the suffete found ways round every obstacle
as a franc-bourgeois you won ’ t have to pay the rates for the streets , the poor , or the lighting to which ordinary citizens are liable
but what he found most heart-rending in this spectacle , what added indignation to his frustration , was the thought of how the gypsy girl must be suffering if she could see it
the anger of their dead companions came back into their hearts and increased their vigour ; they confusedly felt that they were servants of a god dwelling in the hearts of the oppressed and , as it were , the pontiffs of universal vengeance !
the gypsy girl broke silence in her turn
it was salammbo leaving her palace ; a sigh of relief went up
time is passing , i beg you by all that is sacred , don ’ t wait for me to become stone again like that gibbet which claims you too !
and so hard that the parliamentary clerk ’ s pen froze , in the great chamber , with every three words !
the temple groves stood out like lakes of greenery in this mountain of multi-coloured blocks
their eyes were bloodshot , their ankle fetters clattered , their chests all drew breath in unison
tree-shapes , hummocks , swirls , vague animals were traced in their diaphanous thickness ; and the light came in , frightening and yet peaceful , as it must be behind the sun , in the bleak spaces of future creations
the noise is louder than ever over there !
she was alone , all alone in the world , pointed at , shouted at in the street , beaten by the sergeants , jeered at by ragged little boys
try and find anything as beautiful as that !
the wounded , sheltering with one arm under their shields , held out their swords by resting the hilt against the ground , and others , in pools of blood , turned round to bite at heels
that ’ s hard , that is
i am a lioness , i want my cub
con figuras de espantar
whence the complex monuments , buildings of nuance and transition
you saved me , me , a poor lost child in bohemia
this , however , caused no problems for the preparation of the case
a rare genius , who in time of revolution would have made a dazzling appearance on the surface of events , but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to subterranean intrigue and living in the saps ’ , as the due de saint-simon puts it
from the top of the terrace he considered this vague form rising like a ghost from the shadows of the night
in the middle was a large , black stone , half spherical , like a tambourine ; flames burned on it ; a cone of ebony rose behind it , bearing a hand and two arms
i should have seized her , torn her from her home !
stupefaction , anger , indignation left him speechless
she wonders if a foot can really be so small ; and if the child is not there , the dainty shoe is enough to bring back before her eyes the soft and fragile creature
if anyone gives me back my daughter i ’ ll be his servant , his dog ’ s servant , and he can eat my heart if he wants to
but self-interest is not the ruling factor in the noble nature of poets
whoever had climbed up to that sculpture must have risked his life
he leaped on abdalonim
darkness wrapped every object in a kind of haze
the survivors did not move any more than the dead
shouted a norman , recognizable by his nasal accent , we are as closely packed here as the saints at caillouville !
at his order olivier resumed his reading , and his majesty coldly continued his inspection of the cage
but in this whole town the archdeacon was looking at a single point on the ground : the place du parvis ; in all that crowd , at a single figure : the gypsy girl
high flames suddenly appeared ; trumpets sounded ; the soldiers on watch , thinking it was an attack , rushed in the direction of carthage
they looked at each other in amazement ; then all , as if by tacit agreement , thinking perhaps that they had understood , nodded their heads in assent
their excessive bravado disappeared ; they wanted to win , but with as little risk to themselves as possible
while all this merriment was going on , a short sturdy-looking man in the town ’ s livery climbed up on to the platform and stood by the victim
spendius noticed a narrow opening above the door
it was a phantom dressed as a priest
meanwhile she had remained kneeling and was crying out in a state of extraordinary agitation : oh !
the shoe shows the mother all this and makes her heart melt like wax before a fire
he said , the republic is like those wretches ; bent down on the edge of the oceans , it plunges its arms greedily into every shore , and its ear is so full of the sound of the waves that it would never hear the step of a master approaching from behind !
the poor of her time had given her a fine funeral with their tears and blessings ; but to their great regret the pious maid could not be canonized as a saint for want of patronage
finally taanach brought her in an alabaster phial something liquid and coagulated ; it was the blood of a black dog , slaughtered by barren women , on a winter ’ s night , in the ruins of a tomb
how far it is from this to the age when robert cenalis , comparing notre-dame de paris to that famous temple of diana at ephesus , so celebrated by the pagans of antiquity ’ , which immortalized erostratus , found the gallic cathedral more excellent in length , breadth , height , and structure ’ ! number
then the current carried them away
they rubbed the rim of their shields with oil so that arrows would more easily glance off ; the foot soldiers , who wore their hair long , cut it over their foreheads as a precaution ; and hamilcar , from the fifth hour , had all the dishes emptied , knowing that it is a disadvantage to fight with too full a stomach
what then , do you come from the other world ?
lieutenant of saint-germain-en-laye , and we tore a few strips of skin off each other
said gringoire , who was not giving up his idea , but how were you able to escape from him ?
there was nothing strange or mysterious about this cell , apart perhaps from a few glass phials abandoned in a corner , filled with a somewhat dubious powder closely resembling the powder of projection
and when he tried to picture to himself the happiness he might have found on earth if she had not been a gypsy and he had not been a priest , if phoebus had not existed , and she had loved him ; when he imagined that a life of serenity and love might have been possible even for him , that at that very moment here and there on earth there were happy couples , absorbed in long conversations under orange-trees , beside running brooks , in the presence of a setting sun , of a starry sky ; and that if god had so wished he could have formed with her one of those blessed couples , his heart melted with tenderness and despair
they were certainly the two daintiest little pink shoes you ever saw
thus he could find no explanation for her disappearance
besides , he had sources of intelligence in the town and did not want to go , sure that in a few days it would open its gates
by the devil ’ s nails !
i know they were going to take something from somebody ’ s house
cried the captain , that ’ s a word that seldom assaults the ears of a châteaupers !
little things overcome great ones ; a tooth triumphs over a whole body
with the people thus at her feet , the firmament above her , and all around the immensity of the sea , the gulf , the mountains and views of the provinces , salammbo in her splendour merged with tanit and seemed to be the very genius of carthage , her soul incarnate
i ask for nothing better , said oudarde with a sigh , but i ’ m waiting on the good pleasure of monsieur andry musnier
thus , directly beside the park of the tournelles , between the rue saint-antoine and the rue vieille du temple , lay sainte-catherine , with its vast area of cultivation , bounded only by the city wall of paris
the doctor ’ s observatory rose above the maze like a massive isolated column with a little house in place of a capital
they recognized him and came to him
and they all laughed
a large figure of christ could be vaguely discerned above the judges , and everywhere were pikes and halberds , their ends tipped with fire reflected from the candlelight
it is the ass kicking the dying lion
terror , rather than walls , defended the sanctuaries
all were feeble compared with moloch the devourer
mâtho , carrying it like this , crossed the whole plain to the soldiers ’ tents , and the people , on the walls , watched the fortune of carthage go away
the two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager
we wanted to tell our friends the flemings about it
who is that man ?
at length gervaise , the most inquisitive of the three , and consequently the least sensitive , tried to get the recluse to speak : sister , sister gudule !
her eyes seemed to look far away beyond earthly realms
however , gisco went on , the republic had respected their ethnic divisions , their customs , their religions ; they were free in carthage !
but trussed as he was , his look was quite unable to drive away these flies biting at his wound
we have briefly indicated most of the beauties it had in the fifteenth century and has no longer today , but we omitted the chief of them : the view of paris revealed at that time from the top of its towers
so they arrived , always following the quay , at a quite large square
from time to time she gathered up a little strength and said in a voice made jerky from the unevenness of the cobbles and their breathless rush : who are you ?
his massive shaggy head was sunk on his shoulders like a lion ’ s ; they too have a mane and no neck
pierre l ’ assommeur , if you give me another look like that , i ’ ll give your nose a dusting with a few flicks of my fingers
it started from the palace and took up again in the distance , in the direction of the acropolis
and the master of our exchequer , number livres , and the comptroller number !
for my part i possess the philosophy of instinct , of nature , ut apes geometriam [ as bees do geometry ]
hang him , then we can all have some fun
my daughter , my daughter !
what do you have to tell me , master ?
he turned round and shouted to his men to move aside
hallaron dentro un pilar ,
on that day the air was so pure and light that quasimodo felt some renewal of his affection for his bells
they all thought they had been poisoned
a shot from a catapult sent them back ; only the ten were taken away
he broke off : you , you devil ’ s own barmaid , bring me some supper !
meanwhile the pretty girl was there , looking at him with her huge eyes , holding out the tambourine , waiting
what did you pay ?
nervos , catenas , carceres , numellas , pedicas , boias
his horsemen went past the elephants , which were slowing down ; and all the horses , stretching out their bridleless heads , galloped so furiously that their bellies seemed to skim the ground
that was a mistake
unfortunately all the trouble-makers were all the public
he snatched off his tiara , sign of his rank – his tiara with eight mystic tiers and an emerald shell in the middle – and using both hands hurled it to the ground with all his might ; the golden circlets bounced up as they shattered , and the pearls tinkled on the floor
the university covered the left bank of the seine , from the tournelle to the tour de nesle , corresponding in the paris of today respectively to the halle-aux-vins [ wine market ] and the monnaie [ mint ]
draw your sword , phoebus , so that i can see it
they never left their hut , three days from hadrumetum , a shore full of turtles , with palm trees on the dunes
i come down again and go back to my spinning
the question with the pulley !
more than once a chorister , finding him alone in the church , had fled in terror before such strangely glaring eyes
king louis xi had in fact been in paris for two days
isn ’ t the draught of fishes fine and miraculous enough ?
she would steal my child—come along , eustache !
at most she dreamed
she often reproached herself for not having enough gratitude to make her blind to his defects , but she could absolutely not accustom herself to the poor bell-ringer
the argoteers always felt two coming at once , one at their legs , the other on their heads
it was the beginning of the stormy period of jacqueries , pragueries , leagues
his state established between them something like the equality of a common sex , and he was resentful of the girl , not so much because he could not possess her as because he found her so beautiful and above all so pure
the applause in fact so effectively wiped it from her mind that she continued her questioning of the goat
sire , his place is vacant
in front of the twenty-three towers of the fortifications rose twenty-three others of wood
fires burned in open work cylinders , stuck on to poles carried by men
i don ’ t know if that ’ s what you call a mystery , but it ’ s not much fun
dressed in huge black robes , with a tuft of hair on top of their skulls and a rhinoceros hide shield , they wielded a blade with no handle , held by a cord ; and their camels , bristling with feathers , made long , harsh , throaty sounds
what have you done with the cake ?
she sobbed very quietly , with her head in her hands and her face on the floor
then he slung the girl over his shoulder , whence the charming creature hung down gracefully , bent double over his massive head
though despising other nations , carthage had clumsily taken this new invention from them , as rome herself had done with the punic galley ; and five rows of superimposed arches , in a squat style of architecture , with buttresses at the base and lions ’ heads at the top , came out at the western end of the acropolis , when they plunged under the town to pour almost a river into the cisterns of megara
often at night a hideous shape could be seen wandering along the flimsy open-work lacy balustrade which runs along the top of the towers and round the curve of the apse ; once again it was the hunchback of notre-dame
he roared in a voice which drew the attention of the entire hall to this strange altercation
so saying he pointed to the little goat , who , seeing charmolue gesticulate , had indeed thought it appropriate to do the same , and had sat down on its rump , copying as best it could with its forelegs and bearded face the emotional pantomime of the king ’ s attorney in ecclesiastical courts
we may still get there in time
the archdeacon remained silent
here ’ s a marvellous chance to see the famous little cubby-hole of sorcery !
the numidians , libyans , all africa were poised to hurl themselves on carthage
the greatness of a house is assured by keeping the integrity of its prerogatives
when tristan , weary at never finding anything , gave up in discouragement , and he was not easily discouraged , quasimodo continued the search by himself
he ran his hand slowly over his sunken cheeks , and looked for a few moments in amazement at his fingers , which were damp
quasimodo had gripped both jehan ’ s arms in his left hand ; jehan felt so utterly lost that he did not struggle
her bloodless lips moved as though in prayer , and when the executioner ’ s assistant came up to help her down from the tumbril , he heard her repeating in an undertone the word : phoebus
what do i care about your adventure ?
that one ’ s no good
it was like a new world , unknown , unheard of , misshapen , reptilian , teeming , fantastic
the tribune stayed empty , the stage silent
then at the first words of reproach the cowards lost control ; from a distance they waved their own swords , and breastplates , inviting them with insults to come and get them
thought in the form of church doorway would have attended the punishment of thought in book form
he contained himself , and said with calm severity : compère jacques , you come in very abruptly !
at night you would appear in my dreams ; but i could not guess the silent orders of your eyes !
bell-ringer of notre-dame , answered quasimodo , thinking that he was meant to explain to the judge who he was
the barbarians livened up , and soon combat was general , rapid , terrible
the miller ’ s wife there was suckling a fine boy ; it was not far from the university
their haberdashery brought them in scarcely more than number deniers a week , that ’ s not quite number liards-à-l ’ aigle
there were so many lights on the houses that the town looked as if it were ablaze
besides it was very affecting , this protection coming from so deformed a creature upon so unhappy a being , a girl condemned to death rescued by quasimodo
his apathy left him , and gave way to an insane passion for continual action
then from the table he took a nail and a small hammer with cabalistic letters curiously painted on the shaft
two hours later , a man coming from the direction of hippo-zarytus ran up the mountainside
all his worst fears were only too well realized
so he had no hope left , except the slim chance of succeeding in the fearful exercise imposed on him
mutilations , amputations , dislocation of its limbs , restorations ’ , are the greek , roman , and barbaric work of professors quoting vitruvius and vignolo
what do you say to my scheme ?
rising up on his wrists he replied :
it was asserted that from that time on the archdeacon frequently conferred with louis xi when his majesty came to paris , and that dom claude ’ s credit caused umbrage to olivier le daim and jacques coictier who , as was his wont , gave the king a piece of his mind on the subject
olivier went on : to a joiner , for windows , bed , close-stool , and other items , number livres number sols parisis
the girl , she ’ s none of my business , but the goat ! —i don ’ t like those creatures , they have a beard and horns , they look so like a man
its rays , becoming ever more horizontal , slowly withdraw from the pavement of the place and travel up the perpendicular façade , making the countless carvings stand out roundly from their shadows , while the great central rose-window blazes like a cyclops ’ eye afire with reflections from the forge
with the reader ’ s permission , we shall now go back to the place de grève , which we left yesterday with gringoire in order to follow la esmeralda
then hurrying , and making her hurry , for he did not let her go , he made straight for the gibbet , and , pointing it out to her with his finger : choose between the two of us , he said coldly
some spectators did in fact still remain , some scattered about , others grouped round the pillars , women , old folk , and children , who had had their fill of uproar and commotion
its ears aren ’ t as long as his !
one of the guards of the legion stayed outside , stumbling among the stones
die when something so sweet is just starting ?
bellevigne de l ’ étoile nimbly climbed up on the beam , and gringoire looked up a moment later in terror to see him squatting on the crossbar above his head
did he leave his dice behind ?
suddenly the gypsy started , a tear and a flash of joy shone at the same time in her eyes , she kneeled on the edge of the roof and stretched out her arms in anguish towards the square , crying : phoebus !
stay , she said , in a low voice , curt and mournful , convulsively squeezing the hand of the gypsy , who was more dead than alive
and following your orders , master !
but i was willing to batter down its walls to reach you , to possess you !
in that case , agnès noted , it is the third since laetare sunday
what are these books of yours then ?
are you anything of that sort ?
all were drawn up on the seashore , in one long straight line
he said : do you want me to go and fetch him ?
he said , does marriage come into it ?
he gobbles up plaintiffs , gobbles up lawsuits , eats , chews , stuffs himself , crams himself to the brim
that ’ s awkward , said gringoire
certainly during the age of architecture poems , though rare , it is true , were like the monuments
the soldiers hardly had their weapons ; they had drawn themselves up at random
by the pope ’ s navel !
where is the doctor ?
her mother was a good , simple soul , unfortunately , and taught paquette nothing but a bit of sewing , haberdashery and mercery , which didn ’ t stop the little girl growing very tall and remaining very poor
these same atoms dilated according to a certain law only have to be condensed according to a certain other law !
good will never put an extra onion in the soup , and its only use is for getting into paradise ; now paradise and argot are two quite different things
tell me , said the priest , shaking him
no , comrade , the ladder ’ s mine
quasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy
the last shouts died out one by one – and the people of carthage panted , absorbed in its desire for terror
comrade , said clopin , your luck ’ s out
the streets were already dark when gringoire left the palais
he sometimes thought of the little goat , and that was all
whitish vapours drifted over it ; stinging the nose , penetrating the skin , disturbing the eyes ; and the barbarians thought they saw exhaled breaths , their comrades ’ souls
the entire history of the second half of the middle ages is written in heraldry , just as the history of the first half is written in the symbolism of the romanesque churches
the beam of light shining from the doorway glowed red for a moment over their merry faces
then narr ’ havas spread out his hand on mâtho ’ s chest , and mâtho his on narr ’ havas ’ s chest
they heard her murmur :
the case is all ready
carthage could hold out for a long time ; its broad walls afforded a series of re-entrant and projecting angles , well designed for repelling attacks
of the danger of confiding your secret to a goat
you must be a very bold rascal !
they were making the wooden towers higher , and at the same time the terrace was going up
he dropped it on the ground : spendius at once picked it up ; before his master his slave ’ s habits took over again
already half fascinated , i tried to cling to something to halt me in my fall
meanwhile sighs , dying moans reached them
the poor poet looked around him
however , since that is your wish , mesdemoiselles , i ’ ll try
at this entrance maître florian did not stop short , but turning round on his heel , and abruptly aiming at the provost the harangue with which he had been bombarding quasimodo a moment before : monseigneur , he said , i request such penalty as may please you against the accused here present for gross and wondrous contempt of court
the spurs on their chests , like the prow of a ship , tore through the cohorts , which flowed back in great waves
the priest , overcome , stopped again for a moment
quicker than a flash of lightning , the recluse had compared the two shoes , read the inscription on the parchment , and pressed her face , radiant with heavenly joy , to the window bars , crying out : my daughter !
listen , he said to gringoire , stroking his misshapen chin with a horny hand , i don ’ t see why you shouldn ’ t be hanged
the javelin whistled between the cups to go right through the libyan ’ s arm , pinning it so hard to the table that the grip quivered in the air
on the bed pierrat torterue , the sworn torturer , sat nonchalantly
then he began to describe the whole campaign
his train , what would today be called his staff of bishops and abbots , poured on to the tribune in his wake , exciting increased tumult and curiosity among the groundlings
the tambourine of the sacred harlots sounded from tanit ’ s wood , and at the tip by the mappalia the kilns for the clay coffins began to smoke
thus these four lines in her mouth expressed wild gaiety :
the gallows leads to hell
those among them who were not as pious as they ought to have been had hoped that the matter could be settled more easily in paradise than in rome , and had simply prayed to god for the deceased , instead of to the pope
you must go to the barbarians !
and tears of affection and distress ran down her cheeks , into the scars of her tattoo
what use was this thing of the gods to him ?
would you care to initiate me ?
he shot arrows at passing vultures
he simply writhed about on the spout in the most incredible efforts to climb up again
we poor philosophers are to a constable what a bed of cabbages and radishes is to the garden of the louvre
the student remained silent for a moment , his finger in his ear , his eyes fixed on the ground , his expression cross
so that as the greek believed he had as many gods as he had fountains , and the persian as many as he could see stars , the frenchman reckons he has as many kings as he can see gibbets !
at this sight the besieged left the rampart
and if you want to have an impression of the old city such as the modern one can no longer offer , go up , on the morning of some great festival , at sunrise on easter day or whitsun , go up to some high point overlooking the whole capital and experience the waking of the bells
post equitem sedet atra cura [ dark care sits behind the rider ]
fine fellows , our university people !
from every path , every ravine , men sprang up
finally the barbarians came nearer
they sprawled out on cushions , they ate squatting round great dishes , or , lying on their stomachs , pulled out bits of meat and took their fill leaning on their elbows , in the peaceful posture of lions tearing up their prey
these mighty buildings , whose method of formation and vegetation ’ we have discussed elsewhere , did not simply have foundations but , so to speak , roots , whose ramifications extended into the soil as chambers , galleries , stairways , like the building constructed above
but the light stopped at the edge – and the shadow , like a great curtain , revealed only a corner of the red mattress with the tip of a small bare foot set on an ankle
the lions were resting with their chests on the ground and both paws stretched out , blinking their eyes in the bright light , made brighter by the reflection from the white rocks
the child , in anger , bit his hand until he drew blood
you are said to be a great aesculapius and i have come to ask you for some medical advice
alas , maître claude , all that stone-masonry is costing me dear
and with her other hand tore the veils from her head
but she was condemned to continual alternation of hope and alarm
an individual sacrifice was needed , a completely voluntary oblation which was considered to bring the others in its wake
the slingers , distributed in the rear , kept shooting
now i wanted a word with him , but i couldn ’ t get to him because of the crowd , and that is most annoying , because i ’ m in need of some money
several times it almost snapped
he had assumed an air of calm
because he ’ s one of the four official booksellers of the university !
she fell upon her knees , putting her two fingers against her ears in sign of repentance ; and she sobbed , crushed by the priest ’ s words , full of anger against him , terror , and humiliation , all at once
as soon as gisco landed , the soldiers ran to meet him
meanwhile clopin trouillefou had finished distributing the arms
an indistinct murmur came to his ears
captain phoebus de chateâupers , at your service , my beauty !
although she asked tanit every day for mâtho ’ s death , her aversion for the libyan was lessening
this tartarus was simply called the question-chamber ’
the bell for vespers roused me
where is the child ?
gervaise repeated her question , shaking mahiette by the arm and calling out her name
he was indeed an exalted personage , the sight of whom was worth any stage spectacle
these flares flickered in the gusts of wind and reddened the golden combs fastening their braided hair at the neck
no one could ever know
narr ’ havas spied them from some way off in the mountains
six paces further and he fell a third , a fourth time again ; and fresh torture brought him up each time
this immense baying filled carthage with dull continuity
they seemed to ignore her presence , and spoke about her , in front of her , directly to her , aloud , as if she were something rather grubby , rather despicable , and rather pretty
now it was a béjaune ( the name given to newcomers in the university ) whom he had treated to a very rough welcome ; a precious tradition which has been carefully perpetuated to our own day
and when my situation was desperate – we drank our mules ’ urine and ate our sandal straps – when i would have liked the blades of grass to be soldiers , and to form battalions with our rotting dead , you recalled all the ships i had left !
so saying he cheerfully clapped him on the shoulder
as i ’ m doing with your gorget—girls !
i burned all their trees , sacked all their temples , and until the death of the grandsons of their grandsons…
i have never before seen my ugliness as i do now
cried the priest with a terrible look , and pushing the astonished gringoire by the shoulders , he strode away under the darkest arcades of the cathedral
how beautiful you are !
bending over , spendius finally discovered what he was watching
they slithered in the blood ; the very steep slope of the ground made the corpses roll down
meanwhile she felt that some fatality surrounded her , that she was in contact with a supreme , irrevocable moment , and with an effort she went towards the zaïmph and raised her hands to seize it
it was all that was left of claude ’ s family
tell me , robin poussepain , who ’ s that fellow ?
suddenly the girl saw his head reappear , a terrifying expression on his face , and he cried with a groan of rage and despair : i tell you he is dead !
besides , the popular hosier ’ s motion was greeted with such enthusiasm by these burghers , who felt flattered to be addressed as squires , that resistance was pointless
he cried , imitating an auctioneer ’ s tones , to the great delight of all : nobody wants him ?
although she wanted to accuse herself , she did not dare open her lips ; and yet she was choking with the need to voice her sorrow and be comforted
cried one of those on the window ledge
said tristan , what an old harridan !
the play was not due to commence until the last stroke of twelve came from the great clock in the palais
the souls of the dead , he said , are dissolved in the moon as corpses are in the earth
he fell back , drawing in his arms , gaping , almost in terror
there now , young cousin , she said , tugging at his sleeve so that she could speak in his ear
i think the lock ’ s breaking
the archdeacon and the gypsy clashed in his heart
a murmur of horror ran through the audience
i think the old girl is getting upset !
they felt the mountain with their hands , trying to find a way through
the good lady , quite obsessed by her daughter , like any poor mother , did not notice the officer ’ s lack of enthusiasm , and was taking great pains to point out to him in whispers the infinite perfection with which fleur-de-lys plied her needle or wound her thread
everything i ’ m telling you is the truth
i looked at you so hard that i suddenly shivered with terror , i felt in the grip of fate
beyond this place and this night there is nothing to be seen
while you , half wise and half foolish , empty sketch of something or other , some kind of vegetable being which believes it can walk and think , while you go on living the life of which you robbed her , useless as a candle at noonday ?
claude frollo had taught him to talk , read , write
so , as a precaution , they had been carrying arms : that was a crime ; they looked at each other in dismay
he was perhaps ten years old , and no taller than a roman sword
aren ’ t they lucky to be able to see it all , said joannes de molendino with a sigh , still perched up on the foliage of his capital
replied one of the clerks stationed on the window ledge
present-day paris has , then , no general physiognomy
gringoire did not dare breathe or raise his eyes
i shall not do it again , and i will give you a beautiful silver statue , like the one i gave last year to our lady of ecouys
excessive pain , like excessive joy , is something violent that does not last
calculating the distance from the number of steps he took , he arrived right at the place where he had noticed a slanting crack ; and for three hours , until morning , he toiled continuously , furiously , scarcely able to breathe through the chinks in the slabs above , tormented with fears and expecting to die a score of times
the dying rolled about in the bloody mud and bit their injured hands in their rage : and forty-three samnites , a whole sacred spring , slaughtered each other like gladiators
they went to look for him
her eyes were fixed on the ground
a groom came to untie the horse and led it away to the stables
i beg your pardon , my lord
he repeated : yes , i will kill her !
exclaimed fleur-de-lys , looking up with her lovely eyes brimming with tears
then he took his heavy axe , and in front and behind butchered the carthaginians like a flock of sheep
the isthmus was now completely covered with people ; and this long surface , on which the tents looked like huts in a flood , spread as far as the front lines of the other barbarians , bristling with weapons and systematically established on both sides of the aqueduct
i ’ ve had enough of that king and his coughing !
but how were they to convey the necessity of an endless struggle to all these demoralized men , still bleeding from their wounds ?
you hate me even more , i , who am their master !
besides , sire , i did not betray your majesty , it was my lord of angers
but he continued to retreat
let us go back !
it was cruel to make a tantalus of the big , chubby lad
all religions , as well as all races , were to be met with in these barbarian armies , and respect was paid to other men ’ s gods , because they were fearful too
someone fetched , from the peristyle of the temple of melkarth , the bar of a tripod red hot from the coals and , slipping it under the first chain , pressed it against the wound
he had first tried silently and with no great outward effort to burst his bonds
the answer you have just given , you rogue , deserves the halter !
she would be grown up now !
the ethiopian drew a long dagger from his belt , and the three heads fell
the grimace was his ordinary face
then came the throng of the baggage train , the animals , and stragglers
jehan did not dare add aloud : and a little money which i need even more
the hangman howled with pain
the losses had included , silver shekels , , gold shekels , eighteen elephants , four members of the grand council , three hundred of the rich , , citizens , corn for three months , a large amount of baggage and all the war machines !
hold your peace , old woman , put in a stout and stately individual holding his nose as he stood beside the fishwife ; a mass certainly had to be endowed
he kept wanting more
all right , student of antichrist , may you be strangled with your mother ’ s guts !
but what was that in the military harbour , defended by triple walls ?
monsieur , said gringoire , thank you
said the priest , letting go of her arm , you are pitiless !
to this question from the compère , dom claude was content to answer with lofty calm : whose archdeacon lam ?
claude was pacing slowly and solemnly
and while captain phoebus was twirling his burgundian moustache , she slipped down from the horse , like an arrow dropping to the ground , and made off
then a dazzling light made them drop their eyes
life was coming back
he was returning to fulfil his promises ; a hope which was by no means absurd , seeing how deep the gulf was between the fatherland and the army
yes , indeed , maître boniface disome !
the decree has to be executed within three days !
it was mâtho ’ s iberians , lusitanians , balearics , gaetulians ; narr ’ havas ’ s horses could be heard whinnying ; they spread round the hill ; then came the motley throng commanded by autharitus ; and in their midst the unclean-eaters could be recognized from the fishbones they wore in their hair
but the barbarians at each end turned out to be the weaker , especially those on the left , who had emptied their quivers , and the troop of velites , confronting them by now , made large inroads
the cardinal bit his lip
in the circular gallery into which all these corridors ran , there were stacked all along the wall blocks of algumin , sacks of lausonia ( for henna ) , cakes of lemnos earth , and tortoiseshells full of pearls
mahiette , so overcome up till then that she could not speak , made an effort
i won ’ t tell you how delighted she was
time is the architect , the whole people the builder
quasimodo was surrounded , seized , trussed up
at that moment the king raised his voice
and the surrounding crowd repeated oxen !
the music outside continued ; there were three notes , always the same , headlong , frenzied ; the strings grated , the flute boomed ; taanach kept time by clapping her hands ; salammbo , her whole body swaying , chanted her prayers , and her clothes , one after another , fell round her
if you want to know , it ’ s pierre gringoire
no one , not even of the household , must know of his existence !
as if your sacrifice were not enough , you came to me , in my sleep , draped in the zaïmph !
he said between his gums , for he had no teeth left , we are quite prepared now for the door of the sepulchre
the sky behind sparkled with stars
who gave it to you ?
mâtho stopped them , and while the carthaginian wings continued to advance , he made the three inner ranks of his line move outside them ; they soon went past his flanks and his army appeared at triple length
such things are not possible
one day , it was the third of the month of tibby , he was seen rushing down from the acropolis
he told them that it was a sick boy going to seek a cure in some distant temple
thank you , maître claude
the mystery was about to begin
you will beat your breasts , you will roll in the dust and tear your garments !
yes , there is , the hangman went on , as you know very well
at one moment she seemed like a mad woman , at the next a queen
he went on in a low voice , so that they had to listen more carefully
so there i was at my spinning-wheel
the other rams in front of the other gates began to move
these outward manifestations of joy at any piece of good news sometimes went to great lengths : thus , on the death of charles the bold , to the point of promising silver balustrades to saint-martin at tours ; on his accession to the throne , to the point of forgetting to arrange his father ’ s obsequies
behind the silver lamp he had noticed a large blue square held up from above by four ropes , and he went forward , stooping , open-mouthed
he was sullen , silent , and calm
i deny , dom claude said coldly , neither the pharmacy nor the patient
in a twinkling the great hall was empty
he made her kneel down , and keeping his right hand raised and his left stretched out , he swore on her behalf to bring back tank ’ s mantle to carthage
then she was seized with impatience ; she pressed taanach to hurry , and the old slave grumbled :
so do not judge me guilty of sedition and pillage because my clothes are out at the elbows
suddenly his deep-set eyes took on such a shrewdly penetrating expression that gringoire felt , so to speak , probed in his innermost soul by that look
oh goodness , it seems to be the turn of the windows now
they started off again
and when the slaves , in fear and trembling , confessed that they were in the hands of general gisco they cried :
she was already lisping , laughed at her mother like a little mad thing , was plump and chubby , and had lots of sweet little gestures like an angel from paradise
it isn ’ t hebrew , it ’ s latin
preparations for the sacrifice had already begun
the material gaping wide over his shoulders hid his face in shadow , and nothing showed but his blazing eyes staring ahead
hamilcar snatched the cloth strips from his hands
jehan whistling at its head completed the illusion
robin chief-de-ville , hauberk maker ! —for having been passed and admitted master of the said trade ? —that ’ s his entrance fee
it had been wrapped in ox-hides ; iron hoops ran round it at intervals ; it was three times thicker than a man ’ s body , a hundred and twenty-five cubits long , and pushed back and forth by a mass of bare arms it swung to and fro in a regular beat
several of them had tears at the bottom of their robes stopped by a strip of purple , clear evidence that they had not spared their garments in mourning the death of near relatives , and this sign of affliction prevented the rent from spreading
yes killed , all of them , all !
against the bright horizon the villages stood out darkly , in jumbled and jagged shapes
all that could be seen on the plain was a sort of black swarm , from the blue gulf to the white lagoon ; and the lake , where blood had flowed , spread out beyond like a great pool of purple
oh , it is all your fault !
here ’ s a drinking bowl , went on another man , hitting him in the chest with a broken pitcher
between the rows of these equal discs were dug holes , like those of the urns in a columbarium
he vaguely remembered this popular mob , and thought he recognized all the heads which , a few months earlier , had hailed him pope of fools
if the reader , after contemplating the lively , noisy scene being played out in every part of the square , will now turn his eyes on to that ancient half-gothic , half-romanesque house of the tour-roland , which stands at the western corner of the quayside , he will observe in the angle of the façade a large public breviary , richly illuminated , protected from the rain by a little canopy , and from thieves by a grille , which , however , leaves room to turn the pages
but what have you been up to these past two months and more , you wicked man ?
he is strong , isn ’ t he ?
in the days of jupiter ’ s pagans , when the people offered up in the churches a hundred oxen and a hundred ewes , the emperors would give a hundred lions and a hundred eagles
the vanity of science !
i have a lair and i ’ ll drag you there
she was afraid of gisco , and it seemed to her that cries and footsteps were pursuing her
the shimmer of the material , like the splendour of her skin , was something special and peculiar to her
the elephants came into this mass of men ; the spurs on their fronts divided them , the lances on their tusks turned them over as if they had been ploughshares ; they cut , chopped , hacked with the sickles on their trunks ; the towers , full of fire arrows , looked like moving volcanoes ; all that could be made out was a great mass in which human flesh formed white spots , bronze plates , grey patches , blood-red splashes ; the horrible animals , going through the middle of all this , dug out black furrows
for us kings , our dogs must be lions and our cats tigers
he cried , i ’ m going to change your nickname
she spent whole days on top of her terrace , leaning against the balustrade , passing the time by looking ahead
they were fleeing before the army
if i knew where the hem of your garment was trailing , i should cling to it with both hands , and you would have to give me back my child !
mâtho , in the middle of the ruins , turned round to call his comrades
at that moment bérangère de champchevrier , a slender little girl of number , who was looking down into the square through the trefoil apertures of the balcony , exclaimed : oh !
but hamilcar grew annoyed at such loquacity
louis xi watched him with some anxiety
without delay , the intendants of the houses and officials of the republic were strangled in the baths ; old weapons were retrieved from caves where they had been hidden ; swords were forged from ploughshares ; children sharpened javelins at the gates , and women gave their necklets , their rings , their earrings , anything that might help in destroying carthage
have you any knowledge of that ?
coictier , who had eagerly come closer to the book , could not help exclaiming it : well !
hamilcar had stopped talking
autharitus , the one he had wounded at hamilcar ’ s , addressed him
however , the child she was dragging along fell over on his knees ; she stopped , out of breath
there are always some to be found !
i imagine , said agnès la herme , that it ’ s a beast , an animal , the offspring of a jew and a sow ; in fact , something that ’ s not christian and ought to be thrown into the water or the flames
with one exception , however
he never took his eyes off the gypsy girl , and while the wild number-year-old danced and leaped about to the delight of all , his private reverie seemed to become more and more sombre
but the returning master is like tammouz resuscitated ; and beneath your gaze , father , joy and a new life will burst out everywhere !
a moment later a loaf of rye bread , a slice of bacon , some shrivelled apples , and a jug of beer lay on the table
the living being which still existed in him vaguely thought of going back
he was sure now that she had given way in a barbarian ’ s embrace ; he was shaking , raised his two fists
you will stand on tiptoe , as i said ; that will bring you within reach of the dummy ’ s pocket ; you ’ ll search it ; you ’ ll pull out a purse that ’ s in there ; and if you do all that without anyone hearing one of the bells tinkle , that ’ s fine ; you ’ ll be a truand
a few lingering stars were fading out at various points , and there was one very brilliant one in the east in the brightest part of the sky
oh , why did the baals not grant me that mercy !
a visible shudder went right through his body
he writhed on his bed at the knowledge that the brown-skinned girl was so near
you had your teeth into a very decent bit of our paris !
shrill laughter , small children squalling , women ’ s voices
we will get the rich to condemn you !
it is impossible to imagine the liberties taken by architects of that time , even towards the church
as for pierre gringoire , he managed to save the goat and had some success as a writer of tragedy
after a moment or two he stubbed his foot on an obstacle ; he stumbled and fell
he sheathed his sword again
as he uttered those last words , his manner became quite distraught
he was respected for his courage , above all for his strength
some thought they were at a feast , and sang
hamilcar went back with muffled tread , feeling the walls round him : and he arrived in the great hall where the moonlight came in through one of the gaps in the dome ; in the middle the slave , replete , slept , lying full length on the marble pavement
even the hermetics find in the symbolism of that great doorway a satisfying summary of their science , of which the church of saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie was so complete a hieroglyph
put in clopin , and truand ?
he decreed that all able-bodied citizens should be enrolled , he put catapults on the towers , he demanded exorbitant stocks of arms , he even ordered the construction of fourteen galleys that were not needed ; and he wanted everything registered , carefully written down
the clamour was heart-rending
hamilcar remained for a long while as though lost in thought ; at last he said :
i ’ m sure he goes to the witches ’ sabbath
like civilization it has turned the page , and the new spirit of the times finds it ready to write at its dictation
you will become almost immortal and invincible
i am grateful to you for letting me spend another pleasant quarter of an hour
those half-erased memories , almost wiped away by an excess of suffering , were revived by the sombre figure before her , just as invisible letters traced with sympathetic ink stand out bold and fresh on blank paper when brought close to a fire
besides , although they aroused no great wonder , examples of this kind of claustration in the midst of towns were , in fact , frequent , as we have just said
i say , sire , that you may be right , that the hour of the people has not yet come in your kingdom
i have an appointment with a woman
in quasimodo the archdeacon had the most obedient of slaves , the most docile of servants , the most vigilant of watchdogs
whence the vast quantity of cathedrals all over europe , so prodigious a number as to be hardly credible even when verified
the most honoured embassy of the duke of austria ’ brought the cardinal no such worries , but bothered him in another way
the block of stone which formed the base of this repulsive structure was hollow
the name of some big feast-day , anyhow !
at times , however , as in the case of the killers of petit-jean , the paris executioner , and in that of emery rousseau , jean valleret ’ s murderer , secular justice went over the church ’ s head and proceeded to execute its sentence ; but short of a parliamentary decree , woe betide anyone who violated a place of asylum by force of arms !
the customary of the provostry and viscounty of paris had not yet been worked on by president thibaut baillet and roger barmne , advocate to the king
torture me with one hand , but caress me with the other !
immediately he tore his clothes and rolled about on the floor with shrill cries :
the pyre alight on the platform still blazed , and lit up the town in the distance
the slave at once settled her back on the cushions
her hands were clasped together , her eyes fixed
but the play was done for
he thus returned beneath the dark vaulting of the staircase
he went to the window : oh !
sheep bleated , frightened by the storm
the altar inspired dread
to see the harlot swing
finally he knocked seven times with his thumb ; and a whole part of the wall turned as a single block
they were bound at wrist and ankle , and the sombre veils prevented them from seeing anything or being recognized
the people fleeing from arras
a merchant of samos , a certain hipponax , coming from carthage , had told them that a plot was afoot for their escape , and the barbarians were advised to be ready for anything ; the republic was powerful
go and fetch schahabarim
he had found that quite natural on the part of people who , like her , had no prospect other than charmolue and torterue , and who did not ride like him in the realm of the imagination between pegasus ’ two wings
mâtho stayed leaning against the wall ; spendius , drawing closer , went on in a low voice :
those who were moving stopped ; the dying propped themselves up on an elbow and turned round to bless her
all these gates were strong and beautiful too , for beauty does not detract from strength
i love your sword
the people ’ s murmur , continuous as the sound of the sea , floated vaguely round the feast and seemed to cradle it in some wilder harmony ; some recalled the mercenaries ’ banquet ; people gave themselves up to happy dreams ; the sun began to sink , and the crescent moon was already rising in the other part of the sky
there was not a light to be seen
they stayed a long time without speaking
kill me as well !
the gypsy , who had come as far as the entrance to the cell , saw with surprise the roles abruptly changed
in despair i went in as an apprentice carpenter in the timber trade ; but i wasn ’ t strong enough
are you sure , claude continued with his penetrating gaze , that it ’ s only a word and not a name ?
for two new sleeves on the king ’ s old doublet—number sols
his friend replied , staggering along : you like saying so , phoebus , but it has been proved that plato had the profile of a hunting-dog
we do not know if he suddenly realized all these ideas , but featherbrained as he was , he understood that he had seen what he ought not to have seen , that he had just surprised his elder brother ’ s soul in one of its most secret attitudes , and that claude must never suspect this
such a sight would have rent the heart of anyone but a judge
he would have liked to be able to bring the pillory crashing to the ground , and if the lightning in his eye could have struck her , the gypsy would have been reduced to dust before reaching the platform
what was … ’ ; he corrected himself : what is the bailiff ’ s feudal jurisdiction ?
they were beggars and truands travelling through those parts , led by their duke and their counts
carthage was beginning to suffer from thirst
thus , after such hopes , they were back in a much more deplorable situation ; but they tried not to think about it and even not to talk about it
the gypsy girl turned round again
his lascivious mouth left red marks on the girl ’ s throat
charmolue picked up the gypsy ’ s tambourine from a table and , presenting it to the goat in a certain way , asked it : what time is it ?
behind a mountain rose other mountains , and in the middle of the vast lake stood an island all black in colour and pyramidal in shape
every time children caught her eye or her ear the poor mother would rush to the darkest corner of her tomb , and it was as if she was trying to bury her head in the stone so that she would not hear them
you were not there either !
some went to billets in the houses , others camped at the foot of the walls , and the townspeople came to talk to the soldiers
some said that the women , the sick , and the old should be sent away ; others proposed abandoning the town and setting up a colony far away
zarxas seized his sling ; from prudence or savagery spendius stopped him
that question , ill-advised at the moment that eustache put it , revived mahiette ’ s attention
phoebus counted the coins , and turning solemnly to jehan : do you know , jehan , there are number sols parisis there !
that master , however , bent over an enormous manuscript , decorated with strange paintings , seemed tormented by some idea which constantly intruded on his meditations
he snatched the register from maître olivier ’ s hands , and began counting up for himself on his fingers , studying in turn the paper and the cage
then the garamantes began slowly to prowl around
as the street dancer said this , gringoire was particularly struck by her beauty , which seemed to be in perfect harmony with the almost oriental exaltation of the words
[ give of your charity !
he had long ago discovered the truth , that jupiter created men in a fit of misanthropy and throughout the wise man ’ s life his fate lays siege to his philosophy
he said , after examining the object , found apparently on the parapet of the river phlegethon !
the acropolis was covered over with coloured awnings ; the spurs of the triremes , drawn up in line outside the mole , shone like a bank of diamonds ; everywhere was a sense of order restored , a new existence beginning , immense happiness spread far and wide : it was the wedding day of salammbo and the king of the numidians
the crow flies only by day ,
without question , he answered , his thoughts elsewhere
i don ’ t know how i filled in the time between number and number here a fruit seller would give me a plum , there a baker would throw me a crust ; at night i would get myself picked up by the watch , who would put me in prison , and there i ’ d find a bundle of straw
the hôtel de ville !
and the men who own them do not even have a sword to defend them !
messire , said liénarde
didn ’ t you say his name was marc cenaine , the butler from the audit office ?
the priest saw her emerge from below like some dazzling apparition
the tribes who had abandoned the siege of carthage , were thus wandering through the provinces , waiting for a chance , some victory of the mercenaries , to come back
she tried once more to face up to this new incident
among the grotesque figures carved on the wall was one of which he was particularly fond , and with which he often seemed to be exchanging fraternal looks
for a long time his slaves had been bringing waterskins on the perimeter path , where they had built with clay two transverse bulkheads forming a kind of basin
here ’ s the stevedores ’ ladder from the port saint-landry
there ’ ll be time for them to sack the bailiff ’ s residence twenty times over , violate his authority , and hang the bailiff
and the fine doors ?
and if i make the bells jingle ?
are you not ashamed that a woman should make you suffer so much ?
you have a whole army which has not fought , and your men obey you
with the sense of security , hope had returned to her
gringoire took her by the hand , his companion picked up the lantern and walked in front
the two armies drew nearer , were about to touch
her voice failed her
thus , stone-deaf as he was , he was relishing , like a real pope , the acclamations of this crowd which he hated because he felt hated by them
their trunks , daubed with red lead , stood up straight in the air , like red serpents ; a spear was fitted on their chests , their backs were armoured , their tusks extended by curved steel blades like sabres – and to make them fiercer they had been made drunk with a mixture of pepper , neat wine , and incense
claude frollo was no longer in notre-dame when his adoptive son so abruptly cut through the fatal knot in which the unhappy archdeacon had trapped the gypsy girl and trapped himself
it was the hour after which no stranger might remain in the cloister
and a moment later she gave this verse such a tone that gringoire felt the tears spring to his eyes :
in all these different places he enjoys rights over thoroughfares , high , middle , and low justice , and is fully lord
their bodies were shamefully mutilated ; the priests burned their hair to torment their souls ; they were hung up in bits in butchers ’ shops ; some even sank their teeth in them , and in the evening , to finish it off , bonfires were lit at cross-roads
against the duke too , sometimes
and then there were some wild gossips in the crowd , simone quatre-livres , agnès la gadine , robine piédebou
no , i don ’ t , gringoire replied
in their quarter both were like the poets ’ of whom régnier speaks :
as earrings she had silver cymbals which clashed on her cheeks
he slowly climbed the tower staircase , filled with secret terror which must have communicated itself to the rare passers-by in the parvis by the mysterious light from his lamp going up at so late an hour from one loophole to the next to the top of the bell tower
here , as in the great hall , it was especially the women who burst out
it would have needed a lot of ill will not to grasp , through the poetry of the prologue , that husbandry was married to trade and clergy to nobility , and that the two happy couples were the joint owners of a magnificent golden dolphin ( dauphin ) which they intended to award only to the most beautiful of women
she always used to say to me : little one , look after this jewel
she did not want to hurt him , and trembling all over went on singing her romance
guillemette maugerepuis , just look at that bull ’ s muzzle , it ’ s got everything but horns
these words came at the most intense point of his distress , drove his despair to vengeance , revealed a quarry for his anger
the four poor devils began to go pale and looked at each other
what do you believe in then ?
its dark mass was all crisscrossed with lights hurrying from one window to another ; just as , when you have been burning paper , there remains a dark pile of ash through which live sparks run in countless peculiar patterns
when he reached the square all he could see was the fine horse tethered to the door of the gondelaurier mansion
it is a disgrace !
meanwhile the child ’ s cry had brought everyone running , the mother , the girls , the gypsy , and the officer
the goat was definitely the devil
to keep up this war narr ’ havas had exhausted his forests , taken young and old elephants , male and female , and the military power of his kingdom did not recover
when i was with my good friends the truands
timidly to which of the two he should sacrifice a man
and why the suffete did not hand out the money
they tried to split the ground on either side of the gorge : their tools broke
he panted as he repeated : hamilcar !
fifty sols for our servants ’ robes , and number livres for the clerks of our crown for their cloaks !
they are quite right to do so
this chamber , circular in shape , occupied the ground floor of one of those massive towers which still in our own day break through the layer of modern buildings with which new paris has covered the old
this man seemed to be the gypsy ’ s companion
alas , master , the other said with a sad smile , i keep on at my bellows
when he had finished , the poor wretch extended his black lips , no doubt to kiss the lovely hand that had just come to his aid
and more than one called pâquerette ! , and she was lost—eustache don ’ t let me see you biting that cake ! —we could see straight away she was lost one sunday when she came to church with a gold cross round her neck—at number , just imagine !
mâtho , if he were to be believed , was besieging carthage to retrieve the zaïmph ; and he poured out imprecations and ironies over this barbarian , who claimed the right to possess holy things
phoebus stepped back and said coldly : oh !
this greek lesson had made him thoughtful
outside the fortifications lived people of another race and unknown origin – all porcupine hunters , eaters of shellfish and snakes
what do you think of it ?
the soldiers , eye of baal
she uttered a cry and fell among her women , who busied themselves around her
no , i don ’ t know him
the master is really too kind
foul stenches rose up from the edge of the lake ; they wafted through the air with the incense smoke swirling at street corners
when they had gone by the gates were closed behind them , but the people did not come down from the walls ; the army soon spread out across the width of the isthmus
tristan , whose expression was becoming more sinister every moment , addressed the recluse : what do you have to say to that ?
then the greek officers asked for some of the fine suits of armour that were made in carthage ; the grand council voted sums to acquire them
the dog was barking
sometimes the memory of a gesture , a fold of your robe suddenly grips me and traps me like a net !
it was indeed clopin trouillefou
i won ’ t give another sol for his food
however , if they all attacked at once , they would do each other damage in the inadequate space
i can assert that he himself shared the general beatitude , and unlike la fontaine , who asked during a performance of his comedy the florentine : what bumpkin wrote that rhapsodic mess ?
everyone knows that great wealth is not to be gained from literature , and those who are most accomplished at writing good books do not always enjoy much of a fire in winter
smash these false lords !
tomorrow after sunset , you will wait for me at the foot of the aqueduct , between the ninth and tenth arches
the poet went on , voluble with enthusiasm
the ligurians , desperate with thirst , cried out to get to the river
as he penetrated this den , phoebus ’ mysterious companion pulled his cloak up to his eyes
now here we have a case which had not been foreseen by the law ’ , that of one deaf man having to interrogate another
poor saint louis , how they derided him in his own palais de justice !
by this system crops were always abundant , stud-farms skilfully managed , plantations superb
if you were less preoccupied with the fine clothes of the army , monsieur the archdeacon , i would ask you to go and look at that door
after a moment this made a word which the goat had seemingly been trained to write , for it composed it with so little hesitation , and bérangère suddenly cried out , clasping her hands together in wonder :
who cut your arm off ?
it ’ s fire , molten lead , thousands of knives in my heart !
the length of time it was taking to come , according to their conjectures , made its imminent arrival certain
at last he reached the end of the street
was it a vague premonition of the number livres number sous number deniers that the future king charles viii was going to cut from the income of the provostship ?
at the same time another voice , separate from the choir , intoned from the steps of the high altar this melancholy offertory :
he was indeed deaf
the temple of moloch was built at the foot of a steep gorge , in a sinister spot
he said , there ’ s a heap of corpses worthy of the fifth canto of the iliad !
there ’ s a face would bring about an abortion better than any medicines or pharmatics !
it was a sort of monstrous hive , humming day and night
she is the soul of carthage , the priest continued ; and although she extends everywhere , it is here that she lives , under the sacred veil
the search did indeed appear to be continuing there
one man , however , was walking imperturbably up and down in front of the rowdy tavern , constantly looking inside and straying from it no further than a pikeman from his sentry-box
he was laid low by an arquebus
from deep in their chests they produced raucous and hollow tones ; their eyes , fixed on the colossus , shone in the dust , and they swayed their bodies at regular intervals , all together , as if rocked by the same movement
that ’ s a lot of iron , said the king , to contain the lightness of a spirit !
then she sank back into her immobility and marmoreal silence
the carthaginians walked through the camp , surprised by the amount of stuff with which it was crammed
spendius murmured , i do not like these extraordinary coincidences ; the suffete comes back , narr ’ havas goes away… !
oudarde looked , and saw in the corner on which the recluse ’ s eyes were fixed in such sombre ecstasy , a little , pink , satin shoe embroidered with hundreds of gold and silver spangles
in the evening she returned home
when do we see his gallows one ?
i don ’ t see why , he said , poets shouldn ’ t be included among the truands
the king went back up to his retreat in silence , and his train followed him , terror-struck at the condemned man ’ s final groans
caritatemr sang the blind man
let ’ s be on our guard
i own a fief in the rue tirechappe , and all the women are in love with me , as true as it ’ s true that saint eloy was an excellent goldsmith , and that the five trades of the good town of paris are the tanners , the tawers , the baldric makers , the purse makers , and the cordwainers , and that saint lawrence was grilled on eggshells
the gods protect you , you will become rich
human life for the great as for us is a mixture of good and bad
narr ’ havas saw him , crossed the lake shore and came to warn hanno to send men to hamilcar ’ s assistance
once past theology he had plunged into the study of decretals
a large furnace , which he had not noticed at first , stood on the left of the chair , under the window
this man , who made the legions tremble and whom she hardly knew , terrified her like a god ; he had guessed , he knew everything , something terrible was going to happen
he was filled with fury , and filled with fear
she had miscalculated her strength in facing the question
his tent was at the end , three hundred paces from hamilcar ’ s rampart
guillaume longuejoue would beat me
the end of the world is at hand !
a lusitanian of gigantic stature , carrying a man at the end of each arm , passed along the tables spitting fire from his nostrils
she opened her lips
meanwhile the barbarians were growing impatient , they began to murmur , everyone called out to him
we must not disturb her , oudarde said in a low voice ; she is in her ecstasy , she ’ s praying
i can not do anything for you !
there came to reims one day a very odd lot of riders
clopin left the tavern
he called you cowards , thieves , liars , dogs and sons of bitches !
the death of them all was certain and imminent
he threw himself , then , into loving his little jehan with all the passion of a character already profound , ardent , and single-minded
despite their position , the extraordinary courage… ah !
then without stopping salammbo related how melkarth , having conquered masisabal , cut off his head and stuck it on the prow of his ship
the gauls , out of pride , took off their tunics ; they displayed from afar their great white bodies ; to frighten the enemy they enlarged their wounds
some traces of that ancient enclosure still existed into the last century ; today all that remains is the memory , here and there a tradition , the porte baudets or baudoyer , porta bagauda
i felt more inclined to be a schoolmaster ; it ’ s true i couldn ’ t read ; but that ’ s no bar
then the poor wretch , unable to burst the bonds which chained him like a wild animal , grew quiet again
then he gave a dreadful laugh , and suddenly paled again as he contemplated the most sinister aspect of his fatal passion , of that corrosive , poisonous , hateful , implacable love whose only outcome had been the gallows for one of them , hell for the other : she condemned , he damned
her tears suddenly ceased
the bustle increased , doors closed , all the priests took flight , and the elders disappeared beneath the pillars which formed a deep vestibule around the temple
the priest had stumbled to the stairs
he had caught it
with his eyes fixed unwaveringly on a certain spot , he remained motionless and silent ; and there was something about this silence and immobility so fearsome that the savage bell-ringer trembled before it and did not dare risk a clash
who was it then ?
and running his eyes over the document : pure magic , maître jacques !
but he remained quite silent , gazing at her fixedly , or else he spoke at length , and his reproaches were harsher than ever
you are about to learn everything
he was the first to break the silence : so you were telling me to come back ?
when the alarm bell booms , when the cannons roar , when the keep tumbles down with a great crash , when citizens and soldiers yell and kill each other , that will be the hour striking
what a blot on the name of alexander if he had had aristotle hanged !
mahiette came , very moved , in silence and on tiptoe , as one does approaching a deathbed
what had caused such a mood ?
i don ’ t even steal any more , i ’ m above all that , i kill
cried the king , that ’ s an outrageous cage !
her gaze was dull and demented
taanach , take your nebal and play very softly on your silver string , for my heart is sad !
then less out of greed than for show , and to prove to himself that he was well , he attacked cheese and tarragon stuffing , filleted fish , pumpkins , oysters , with eggs , horseradish , truffles , and kebabs of little birds
it was like a gradually increasing pyramid
the lamp made great patterns of iridescent light play over the panels
here are three sculptures in the round by jean maillevin
loaves dusted with aniseed alternated with great cheeses , weighing more than discuses , bowls full of wine , and pots full of water beside golden filigree baskets containing flowers
then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of tisane
from his skinny , wrinkled hand one could guess that he was an old man
he had let himself be led and pushed , carried , perched , bound and bound again
salammbo had taken part in this indirectly ; she was included in the same resentment ; she must be punished
it was therefore decided that the finest heads of hair among plebeian wives would be chosen
i am expecting someone
the new art takes the monument as it finds it , forms a crust upon it , assimilates it , develops it as it pleases , and completes it if it can
on top of a mast planted before spendius ’ tent a scrap of green cloth appeared : it was the signal
he answered : blessings on you !
hamilcar ’ s men found this such a good joke that they roared with laughter
hurry up , arm yourselves !
one evening as they were walking together through the streets of the camp , they noticed some men in white cloaks ; among them was narr ’ havas , prince of the numidians
these cups , adorned with an emerald vine on each of their six golden facets , belonged to a militia composed exclusively of young patricians , those who were tallest
is it a conquered town , or the palace of a chief ?
child , do you know that those tears are burning lava ?
no , my lord , the old woman replied , except that in the report they described my house as a stinking , dilapidated old hovel , which is most offensive language
what does that matter !
when he had broken the arrow , quasimodo gave a noisy snort , sprang like a grasshopper , and fell upon the student , whose armour was flattened against the wall by the blow
traders , scribes , workers in the arsenal , whole families went along to the barbarians ’ camp
the city then had five bridges : three on the right , the pont notre-dame and the pont-au-change of stone , the pont-aux-meuniers of wood ; two on the left , the stone petit-pont and the wooden pont saint-michel ; all with houses on them
the reflections resulting from such refraction were inevitably divergent and deviant
[ john number : number—he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death into life ]
the gate was raised , and the trireme disappeared beneath the deep vault
the stupefaction written on his features gave way to a mood of bitter , profound dejection
finally he came into khamon ’ s square , where the balearics had perished ; mâtho stopped , blenching like a man about to die
at the head of the pont-aux-changeurs , behind which one could see the seine foaming beneath the mill-wheels of the pont-aux-meuniers , stood the châtelet , no longer a roman tower as it was under julian the apostate , but a thirteenth-century feudal tower , of stone so hard that in three hours with a pickaxe you could not chip away a hand ’ s thickness
the president continued bluntly : then how do you explain the facts with which you are charged ?
you look like a fury ’ s breast !
at the time some kind of stories were circulating about a bogeyman-monk prowling the streets of paris by night , and he vaguely recalled them
the wall at that spot had been abandoned , because the cliff was so inaccessible
they went off in isolated detachments , or straggled with long intervals between each group
he had simply gone back to rejoin his company , in garrison at queue-en-brie , in the île-de-france , a few stages from paris
but tristan had not gone yet
his hate could now see a definite prey ; and as it became easier to imagine revenge , he thought he almost had it and was filled with delight
the archbishop took an interest in the gypsy child , he exorcised it , blessed it , carefully drove the devil out of its body , and sent it to paris to be put out on the wooden bed at notre-dame as a foundling
i don ’ t understand at all , gringoire answered
the man , the artist , the individual are erased from these great masses with no author ’ s name ; they are a summary of human intelligence and represent its sum total
among so many wonderful engravings , there is one etching in particular representing , so it is supposed , doctor faustus , which any viewer must find quite dazzling
it was quite remarkable that with all that physical strength , developed to such an extraordinary degree , quasimodo should have blindly put it at the disposal of another
that ’ s how i am made
he is the devil , added a third
in the corner of a wall a man stepped back , frightened by this sparkling thing going through the darkness
the poor girl had summoned up her courage in vain
what would there be at the end if everything came at the beginning ?
this caused quarrels and fights among them
haven ’ t you ever had a cub ?
one such may have romanesque feet , a gothic middle , a graeco-roman head
it formed , as it does today , an irregular trapezium , bounded on one side by the river quay , and on the other three by a series of tall , narrow , gloomy houses
the crowd thronged the streets
but for the present they could not disguise their anxiety , they were too pale ; the crowd awaiting them at the gates escorted them to the palace to extract some news from them
the trumpets had stopped blowing
as for the mercenaries ’ pay , it filled roughly two wicker panniers ; in one of them could even be seen some of those leather discs which the republic used to save coins ; and as the barbarians looked quite amazed , hanno told them that , since the accounting was too difficult , the elders had not had time to examine it
however , as the newcomer did not utter a word , he did not know what to think
—the maréchal de clermont was hauled off bodily ’ —and so on
he felt as if he were made of stone , too heavy to flee
rym answered with a negative gesture , accompanied by an anxious smile
we ’ ll see which will win , face-pulling or the literary arts
he looked like a giant , broken into pieces and then badly mended
with daybreak the mercenaries were amazed to see all the carthaginians thus entrenched as though in a fortress
the archdeacon did not even look up at him
o barbedienne , you clod !
beyond the tower balustrade , exactly beneath the spot where the priest had stopped , there was one of those fancifully carved stone waterspouts which bristle all over gothic buildings , and in a crevice of this spout , two pretty wallflowers in bloom , shaking and almost brought alive by the breeze , were greeting each other with playful bows
at the same time she began to speak , but in tones so beseeching , so gentle , so submissive and so harrowing , that around tristan more than one old sergeant who would have eaten human flesh was wiping his eyes
she said , the fact is i am breaking a vow… i ’ ll never find my parents again… the amulet will lose its virtue—but what of it ?
beside it could be made out the decaying roofs and unpaved precinct of the court of miracles
at that name spendius gave a start
it enclosed monsters without feeling , incoherent parts of forms to be born and which are painted on sanctuary walls
as to what you said , i did not understand ; but i saw that you wanted to drag me towards something dreadful , to the depths of an abyss
mademoiselle , went on the caressing voice of the attorney in ecclesiastical courts , for the third time , do you persist in denying the facts of which you are accused ?
it ’ s tough and stubborn !
hanged by the crowd for waiting , hanged by the cardinal for not waiting , all he could see on either side of him was an abyss that is a gallows
so the elders decided that he would go from his prison to the square of khamon , with no escort , arms tied behind his back ; and it was forbidden to strike him in the heart , so that he should live longer , to put out his eyes , so that he could see his torture to the end , to throw anything at him or strike him with more than three fingers at a time
the boy had to be dragged along , non passibus aequis [ not with even steps ] , as virgil puts it , and kept stumbling , to his mother ’ s loud protests
let me tell you then—but there ’ s no need to stop while i tell you the tale—that paquette la chantefleurie was a pretty girl of number when i was the same age , that is eighteen years ago , and it ’ s her own fault if she ’ s not like me today , a good , healthy mother of number , with a man and a boy
enter fancy and caprice
he broke off : oh yes !
are you having us on ?
the great ditch became full to overflowing ; as the living trod on them , the wounded became piled up in confusion with the dead and dying
she seized his bald head in both hands by his remaining hair , and strove to ward off his kisses as if they had been bites
the girl could find only one word : oh , my phoebus !
you are someone who looks like a kind lord !
but their trials , recalled through a drunken haze , seemed to them prodigious and ill-rewarded
some cried to him : come back !
applause and laughter broke out
gladly , but i don ’ t have any money
that voice , although full of menace , recalled to him another voice which had that morning struck the first blow at his mystery play with its nasal whine in the midst of the audience : charity , please !
that ’ s a fearfully short skirt , added la gaillefontaine
i was pure , my soul was filled with limpid brightness
you can see , eye of baal , the servant said trembling , they have not yet taken everything !
a vast silence filled megara
autharitus , guessing at his words from his expression , applauded him
some statistician or other has calculated that if all the volumes printed since gutenberg were piled one on top of another they would reach as far as the distance from the earth to the moon , but that is not the sort of grandeur we want to talk about
the very humblest stops up a hole or lays a stone
it was quite certainly at the hôtel de ville , oudarde retorted tartly , because doctor scourable gave them a latin oration which pleased them greatly
it was like a pack of elegant greyhounds circling , with flaring nostrils and blazing eyes , round some poor woodland doe which their master ’ s eye forbids them to devour
three hours later they came to a second plateau , ringed by a circle of green hills
blast it if i understand you !
gringoire had to be content with this word of praise , for thunderous applause , accompanied by a tremendous burst of cheering , cut short their conversation
olivier made a thumbmark at the article on the rogue and vagabond ’ and proceeded
do you want her to die then , she through whom you are alive ?
however his skinny ribs rose and fell , and his eyes , wide open in the middle of his dead-white face , stared continuously and unbearably
it has , to be sure , lost more in beauty than it has gained in size
last appeared the structures of the tall machines : carrobalistae , onagers , catapults , and scorpions , swaying about on wagons drawn by mules and ox-teams – and as the army deployed , the captains ran panting from right and left to pass on orders , close up ranks and keep intervals
at number i tried to find a trade
asked guillemette la mairesse
she said almost unconscious
the others did not answer – or , losing their temper , picked up a stone and threw it in their face
he continued on his way down
and you will see them again
jehan remained dignified and impassive
carthage is ours ; let ’ s throw ourselves upon it !
i reckon that no charitable person wanted anything to do with him
next they came to a field of beans ; and the whole lot disappeared as though a cloud of locusts had passed by
several turned rapidly round and round , like panthers wounded in the forehead
i have no idea
however he was hard on her , and did not spare penances and bitter words
come to the palace of the tournelles tomorrow and ask for the abbot of saint-martin of tours
what little could be glimpsed of human shape beneath that envelope of mourning made one shudder
that ’ s a long time yet !
it was indeed the archdeacon
it was none other
he went on , walking , running , taking any street at random , making no choice , simply driven on all the time by the grève , by the horrible grève , which he vaguely felt lay behind him
he had been standing there for a few minutes , thinking or unthinking , leaning in silence against the carved mantelpiece , when fleur-de-lys , suddenly turning round , spoke to him
he was not listening to her : oh !
by their fall they signified stars , sky , fire ; by their colour , darkness and night ; by their density , the cohesion of earthly things
and you want nothing to do with a man damned !
but the purple curtains were lifted : and on a wide pillow was revealed a puffy , expressionless human head ; the eyebrows resembled two ebony bows , meeting at their tips ; gold sequins sparkled in the crinkly hair , and the face was so pallid that it looked as though it had been sprinkled with powdered marble
in what fatal order had he ranged in his mind la esmeralda , phoebus , jacques charmolue , his beloved young brother , whom he had abandoned in the mire , his archdeacon ’ s cassock , perhaps his reputation , dragged along to la falourdel ’ s , all these images , all these adventures ?
a glass mask , which jehan noticed among the alchemical utensils , and which served no doubt to protect the archdeacon ’ s face while he was concocting some fearsome substance , lay in a corner , covered in dust , as though forgotten
gringoire kept on , and had soon caught up with the most sluggish of these larva-like shapes , which trailed behind the others
he had been captured , and had escaped ; recaptured , he had worked in quarries , gasped in the bath-houses , cried out under punishments , belonged to numerous masters , suffered every rage
listen , friend , you talk too much
the man did not say a word
dante could find no better scheme for his inferno
i was told she had taken refuge in notre-dame , and that she was safe there , and i ’ m delighted , and i haven ’ t been able to discover whether the goat got away with her , and that ’ s all i know about it
he covered her with slavering kisses
gringoire slashed at the table with his knife , the girl smiled and seemed to be looking at something through the wall
i have no heart left
there are soldiers everywhere
then they turned again on the captives
blood on these cobbles !
the good lord knows !
the crowd was so great that their departure was not noticed
he got work going on the ramparts , and had the old , now useless , inner walls demolished to furnish stone
their excesses became confused with his daughter ’ s shame , and he was angry with the whole household for knowing about it and not telling him
mâtho put his hand on it ; then he stuck his head through the opening , wrapped his body in it , spread out his arms to see it better
he stopped , out of breath , then went on , beside himself : all i see around me are people getting fat from my leanness !
if it is winter , he is there , crawling on the carpet , clambering laboriously on to a stool , and his mother is fearful in case he goes too near the fire
anyhow , what ’ s that got to do with your gypsy ?
one last despatch made louis xi frown : what ’ s this ?
i don ’ t want the rich eating me up
she went back into the crowd
soft and swift footsteps could be heard ; and from the direction of the portcullis and of the gorge pointed muzzles and erect ears appeared ; wild eyes shone
well then , what ’ s his tongue for , this polyphemus ?
what does it matter !
he seemed to be about number years old , and spoke in what was no human language ; the words were just not possible
however , for following passers-by ( especially female ones ) through the streets , something gringoire enjoyed doing , there is no better frame of mind
now he had stirred up a band of students , who had made a classic assault on a tavern , quasi classico excitati [ as if roused by the trumpet call ] , had then beaten the innkeeper with offensive sticks ’ , and joyfully plundered the tavern , even staving in the hogsheads of wine in the cellar
my friend , said tristan l ’ hermite , i presume that ’ s the witch we ’ ve been looking for
there too someone was awake
a word , my lovely child !
then he went up again
look out , robert poussepain !
in any case a man who knew the way would accompany her
his sight ’ s no better than his hearing
you must know , then , that my name is pierre gringoire , and i ’ m the son of the tax-farmer for the gonesse district
said the archdeacon , an alchemist ’ s crucible
its open wings extended over the wall , its elongated hands came down to the ground ; three black stones , rimmed with a yellow circle , represented three eyes in its brow , and its bull ’ s head was raised in a terrible effort , as if to bellow
quasimodo let them robe him without a flicker of protest and with a kind of proud docility
coictier tried hard to give a mocking laugh , shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly , and repeated in an undertone : a madman !
as long as the demon sent to attack me only the vague shadows of women passing occasionally before my eyes in church , in the street , in the fields , and rarely returning in my dreams , i easily overcame him
and then i plunge back into the battle !
they killed all the dogs , all the mules , all the donkeys , then the fifteen elephants brought back by the suffete
for quarter of an hour i ’ ve been waiting for the first blow , nothing happens
both wore long , slate-grey gowns , trimmed with grey squirrel fur , belted and fastened , with caps of the same material and colour
then terror came upon carthage
first there was an excellent salary , to which were attached , hanging like extra bunches on his vine , the revenue from the civil and criminal registries of the provostry , plus the revenues , civil and criminal , from the lower courts of the châtelet , not to mention some small tolls from the bridges of mantes and corbeil , profits from the duty on blacksmiths ’ iron in paris , and from the assizers of firewood and inspectors of salt
the unhappy woman had flung herself upon this shoe , her consolation and despair for so many years , and her heart was racked with sobs as on the first day
mahiette shook her head thoughtfully
the gypsy ’ s arrival abruptly upset that balance
she trembled in every limb , her voice shook , her eyes shone , she had risen to her knees
cried the children ; the ironmonger ’ s ghost !
that is being two and yet only one
shall i , wretch that i am , never see daylight again ?
a furnace was set into the thickness of the wall
coppenole added , that reminds me of when the lord of hymbercourt ’ s house was burned down
you gypsy mother , you ’ ve eaten my child !
why are you talking of rewards for these men ?
i shall do it only this once
the cardinal burst out laughing
he moreover enjoyed the friendship of messire tristan l ’ hermite , provost-marshal of the king ’ s household
what ’ s the meaning of this , sir ?
this chant , which some old men lost in the distant darkness were chanting over this beautiful creature , full of youth and life , caressed by the warm air of springtime , bathed in sunshine , was the mass for the dead
a running stream of words ! —what ’ s your plan ?
you will recall the loving curiosity with which your mind and eyes fastened on that little whirlwind , humming and whirring on its purple and azure wings , in the midst of which floated an elusive shape , veiled by the very speed of its movement
he experienced the kind of shame which our la fontaine has so admirably defined : ashamed as a fox caught by a hen ’
she walked on though , and then she stopped
he sent him fat goats , gold dust , and ostrich plumes
here and there , to be sure , were some inscriptions on the walls , but they were simply scientific or pious maxims taken from reliable authors
when gringoire finally stopped , quite out of breath , he looked up trembling at the king , who was scratching with his nail a patch on the knee of his hose
then he laughed , and his laugh was the most heartrending sound imaginable
here you have the brick houses with stone quoins of henri iv : the place royale , the place dauphine
that was her little foot
they went into caves to catch hyenas alive , then amused themselves in the evening by racing them along the sands of megara , between the steles of the tombs
i deny the physician
she must have swum across , replied the recluse , defending her ground inch by inch
the fifty tollenones , overlooking the battlements , thus surrounded carthage like monstrous vultures ; and the negroes laughed to see the guards on the rampart dying in appalling convulsions
here phoebus , not gifted with a specially creative imagination , began to wonder how on earth to extricate himself from his supposed feat of arms
do you have a heart ?
my charmer , the moon shines bright , just look through the vent up there at the wind ruffling the clouds
we don ’ t hear his laugh any more
in the whole town she believed herself to be disliked by only two persons , about whom she often talked with dread : the sachette of the tour-roland , a nasty old recluse who bore some unknown grudge against gypsy women , and cursed the poor dancer whenever she went by her window ; and a priest who never encountered her without looking and speaking to her in a way that frightened her
salammbo was then descending the galley staircase
he drew his sword , then stammering , for anger makes one tremble as much as fear : here !
i don ’ t know hebrew
in her nostrils she wore a coral button , and she stood beside the bed , straighter than a statue of hermes , with her eyes lowered
and if you have a troubled conscience , curses on your heads !
he had told her the secret of the origins in order to distract her by loftier perspectives ; but the virgin ’ s desire was rekindled by these last words , and schahabarim , half yielding , went on :
the tablets had been sent by greek soldiers from sardinia
the palsied were brought along on litters ; many had the foresight to bring food with them and stayed until evening ; others spent the night there
it was all treble rebecs , counter-tenor rebecs , tenor rebecs , not to mention flutes and brass
they are running up !
she cried ; and salammbo escaped out of sight
a massive fire burned within it , the reflection of its red glare filling the cellar and depriving a wretched candle standing in a corner of any radiance
there is in them a human quality which they constantly blend with the divine symbol under which they are still produced
finally they came beneath the walls of carthage to implore the protection of ceres and proserpine , for in byrsa there was a temple and priests dedicated to these goddesses , in expiation of the past atrocities committed at the siege of syracuse
the recluse breathed again
she saw his frightful look and tried to flee
a single pointed window , tightly set into the thick wall , let a wan beam of january daylight fall on two grotesque figures , the fanciful stone devil carved as a cul-de-lampe on the keystone of the vault , and the judge sitting at the far end of the room upon the fleurs-de-lys
his companion had disappeared during the struggle
i have studied hermetics , exclaimed coictier , and i maintain … ’
the hands and heads of the people in this crowd , standing out dark against the luminous background , were silhouetted in one weird gesture after another
your stool limps as badly as one of martial ’ s distichs : one foot is a hexameter , the other a pentameter
so , claude put in , his brow steadily clearing , it ’ s your belief , maître pierre , that this creature has never been approached by a man ?
however , it was apparent from the first glance that these three fragments of city formed a single body
then great tears fell from her eyes one by one , and ran down her furrowed cheeks like a torrent in the bed it has scoured out
the carthaginians felt their strength increased , and battle began again
when their despondency had quietened down a little they examined what provisions they had
he began to walk
didn ’ t even see that our privileges were respected on a day like this !
his heart burst out in furious words
, different in each language , was understood by all
the human body , darkness ; the stars , darkness !
besides , to be fair to him , his viciousness was perhaps not innate
in tragedy it ’ s what we call a monologue
i would like to beat her !
she did not dare to look at him and just lay inert
with some difficulty dom claude managed to hear what they were saying through the pounding of the blood in his temples
the power of the archdeacon over the bell-ringer , the bell-ringer ’ s attachment to the archdeacon defy comparison
then he began to harry them
clopin trouillefou , dressed up in his royal insignia , was no more and no less ragged ; the sore on his arm had already disappeared
monseigneur le cardinal , coppenole said without loosing coppenole ’ s hand , he ’ s a friend of mine
never , adds an eye-witness of number , have the sudden metamorphoses of the court of miracles been more felicitously depicted
that man you call the duke of egypt , is he the chief of your tribe ?
he was on the ground , kneeling in front of her ; he put his arms around her waist , his head thrown back , his hands roving over her ; the gold discs hanging from his ears shone against his bronzed neck ; great tears welled up in his eyes like silver globes ; he sighed endearments , and murmured vague words , lighter than a breeze and soft as a kiss
musnier , we ’ ll thrash your lackey
he was seized by the waist , lifted up and drawn away outside the rampart , to a spot where the terrace was high
he made as if to lunge at the captain
he watched her attentively while she was speaking
he had been able to judge how impregnable was the modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy , and he had worked out mathematically to the power of two the resistance of that chastity
he began to heap insults on them
the town penetrated even further into the countryside than the university
but his words revealed just as much agitation
who do you take me for , friend ?
i take an interest in you and wish you well
hanno denounced the unworthiness of such an insult ; he had caught the disease as a result of a chill at the siege of hecatompylus , and tears ran down his face like winter rain on a ruined wall
meanwhile the dismal cavalcade had passed through the crowd amid cries of joy and people straining to see
he used it to enter the church
with her teeth she held up the hem of her robe which hampered her , and in three leaps she found herself on the platform
they did not stop any more
monsieur the high provost , i ’ d rather have a hole in my insides than see a scratch on her finger
curses on you who robbed tanit !
for my part , i used to think that truth was dead , and had not found a confessor
this was , to be sure , one of the most irksome smiles he had ever had to assume for the sake of the king ’ s good pleasure
no , my lord , that ’ s where i stop understanding
sweat off your gold and your pox !
that immense body is empty ; it is a skeleton ; the spirit has left it
the barbarians looked at each other in silence
they slumped down , feeling an icy chill in their backs , and overwhelming heaviness in their eyes
claude carried little jehan to her himself
i ’ m cold , i ’ m afraid , and there are creatures that climb over my body
so she took her to the gypsies ; and the gypsy women were all over the child , admiring her , fondling her , kissing her with their black mouths , and marvelling over her little hand
i can not read , only spell out the letters
now and then i still compose epics and tragedies , but what brings me in most is that industry you have seen me at , master—carrying pyramids of chairs in my teeth
the whistle made a clear , shrill , piercing sound
the archdeacon began examining the vessel
one condition , the man said
anyone who could have seen the captain ’ s face blaze at that moment , the way he sprang backwards , so violently that he broke loose from the pincer grip that had seized him , the haughty expression with which his hand flew to his sword hilt , and faced so angrily the bleak immobility of the man in the cloak , anyone who had seen that would have been terrified
the exhausted mercenaries could not stand against his troops
it was to see a negro rolling on the ground , thrashing about , with staring eyes , twisted neck , foaming at the mouth
it ’ s as good a show as any
at last three samnite shepherds discovered him fifteen paces from the recent site of mâtho ’ s tent
then came a prodigious yell , in which every language , every dialect , every accent mingled
several men fell to their knees ; the others , continuing , walked over them
as he looked at the prisoners he revelled in imagining their punishment
she has indeed taken refuge in notre-dame
a great clamour rose up in the mappalia
we ’ ll go from bishop guillaume ’ s doorway and saint-jean-le-rond to the sainte-chapelle , then to nicolas flamel ’ s house , in the rue marivault , to his tomb , in the holy innocents ’ cemetery , to his two hospitals in the rue de montmorency
three , however , emerged from the crowd and came to sniff at him
these wretches were scarcely recognizable , with their faces hidden beneath vermin and filth
the idea of committing sacrilege revived the mercenaries ’ greed ; they quickly set fires under bronze pots and enjoyed watching the fine fish struggling in the boiling water
cerberus would not nibble at the honey cake
then he gently patted the thick wall of the keep , like someone stroking a charger ’ s crupper
she has probably forgotten me , and i don ’ t even know her name
then silence fell on everything , some remaining perched on the pediment of buildings , shading their eyes with their hand , while others lying flat at the foot of the ramparts listened intently
suddenly he dropped the wooden leaves and flung himself down full length , with arms outstretched , in the position of a condemned man
no roof of iron crosses , no octagonal lantern , no slender columns rising to spread out on the edge of the roof into capitals of acanthus and flowers , no chimerical and monstrous waterspouts , no carved timbers , no delicate sculpture deeply cut into the stone
my father charles vii used to say that truth was ailing
from the first step he took she had stood up ; then , involuntarily , as he drew nearer , she had gradually come further forward to the edge of the terrace ; and soon all the outside world was blotted out and she saw only mâtho
no words can describe the amazement mixed with fright which fell with this beam upon the bandits
the cool breeze blowing downstream stirred the leaves of the single tree planted at the tip of the terrain quite audibly
perhaps he had stayed behind ?
i will buy my freedom !
but now salammbo felt no fear of him
he said to the poor sleeping clerk , and went off
the beggar accepted the alms and the gibe without flinching , and went on crying mournfully : charity , please !
he had just bought this cloak from the secondhand-clothes dealer near the pomme d ’ ève , no doubt as protection against the cold march evenings , perhaps to conceal his dress
her body bounced with every jolt of the tumbril like a thing dead or broken
then from that eye , which up to then had been so dry and burnt up , a big tear could be seen slowly rolling down that misshapen face , so long distorted by despair
some tore off their amulets and spat on them
that head was very deformed
sire , the provost of paris answered , i suppose that as the people have come to snatch her out of her asylum in notre-dame , they are offended by her impunity and want to hang her
jehan observed with a sigh that there was no saucepan
but someone , under the trees , was running behind them ; and mâtho , who was carrying the veil , several times felt it being pulled very gently from below
twenty good lancers could easily have stopped them with a frontal attack on their column ; the carthaginians watched them pass by in utter amazement
she imagines she can see him , she does see him , all of him , living , joyful , with his delicate hands , round head , pure lips , untroubled eyes with the whites still tinged with blue
the story of a maize cake
we ’ ve got his palliasse , we ’ re going to make a bonfire with it !
my father ’ s a bird—my mother ’ s another ,
it had not yet then been obstructed by the tall forest of chicanery and legal procedure which these two jurisconsults planted there at the beginning of the sixteenth century
where could it be then ?
she struggled in his arms
finally mâtho murmured : beaten !
everyone tried to turn round and face the place
she would caress her , kiss her , tickle her , dress her up , almost eat her !
great flashes of lightning came from time to time ; then it became darker than ever ; and all she could see were mâtho ’ s eyes , like two embers in the night
with the power of punic money behind him , the adventurer had caused the numidian states to revolt by promising them their freedom
[ against goads , red-hot irons , crosses and shackles , fetters , chains , prisons , hobbles , foot-chains , iron collars ]
at length he fell down a second time , exhausted ; he dragged himself out of the cell on his knees , and crouched down facing the door in an attitude of astonishment
thief from egypt , you will be going up there again !
what do you need then to break it down ?
you are off to look for lodgings in the rue thibautodé , aren ’ t you , monsieur le recteur , the man who gambles with the devil ?
spendius had been right in foreseeing it
finally he stopped with a look of despair
suddenly a puff of wind blew his lamp out , and at almost the same time he saw appearing , at the opposite corner of the tower , a shadow , a patch of white , a shape , a woman
the routes he took remained always unknown
in fact , of the soundest , etruscan , libyan , and spartan mercenaries , had gone to the heights from the beginning , and had so far stayed there unsure what to do
she made one last effort and began to cry : help !
as he thus delved into his soul , when he saw what spacious provision nature had made in it for passions , he laughed all the more bitterly
that ’ s a bit much
a novice ’ s habit from the hôtel-dieu
he said hastily : oh !
serpents had feet , bulls wings , man-headed fish were eating fruit , flowers were blooming in crocodiles ’ jaws , and elephants with raised trunks passed proud as eagles through blue sky
former caravan leaders tied ropes tightly round their bellies
some insisted on following the armies
she said , flushed and anxious , i do feel warm !
but such is the king ’ s good pleasure
indeed , when after groping one ’ s way up the long , dark spiral staircase , pierced vertically through the thickness of the tower walls , one at last emerged on to one of the two lofty platforms , flooded with light and air , it was a fine picture that on every side at once unfolded before the eye ; a sight sui generis , which can be readily visualized by those of our readers who have been lucky enough to see a gothic town intact , complete , homogeneous , such as the few still remaining , nuremberg in bavaria , vittoria in spain , or even smaller specimens , so long as they are well preserved , vitré in brittany , nordhausen in prussia
as the work of demolition seemed to be making progress , the mother automatically moved back , pressing the girl more and more tightly against the wall
these preparations annoyed the barbarians
are you crazy , jehan ?
without realizing what he was asking for , she was seized with horror
he came to spendius and said :
by the pope ’ s bowels !
at that moment the cell rang with the clanking of weapons and the noise of galloping horses which seemed to emerge from the pont notre-dame and to be approaching nearer and nearer along the quay
this pile of ordinary dwellings , packed together like cells in a beehive , had a beauty of its own
many women had come there to weep , until they died , for parents , lovers , sins
then he said : i frighten you
louis ’ s face became sombre and thoughtful
the king looked straight at him : i said tomorrow morning
not that pierre gringoire felt any fear , or contempt , for the cardinal
windows are your eyes
for less than a week ago we had the miracle of divine punishment being visited by our lady of aubervillers on the man who scoffed at pilgrims , and that was the second miracle this month
the halberds of the colourfully dressed beadles rang on the floor , and a few moments later a long procession of priests in chasubles and deacons in dalmatics , chanting as they advanced gravely towards the condemned girl , came within her sight and the eyes of the crowd
he made great efforts to convince himself that he was mistaken , that there was only one cross , and even to believe that there were none at all
suddenly a light shone out , and in an instant seven or eight lighted torches cast their light over the heads , their tufts of flame flickering in the shadows
he had the trumpets sounded
oh , tower of babel !
it was quasimodo ’ s whistle
the four characters of the prologue were bemoaning their insoluble predicament , when venus in person , vera incessu patuit dea [ a true goddess was evident in her step ] appeared before them , wearing a fine cotehardie emblazoned with the ship of the town arms of paris
so nothing shows outwardly of the fire burning my heart !
when he was outside , he took the great zaïmph from around his neck , and raised it as high as he could above his head
from then on he did not stir
her thoughts were locked up in it , never to leave it until her death
all that didn ’ t stop me growing up tall and thin , as you can see
the king did not notice
the goat looked at him shrewdly , lifted a gilded hoof and knocked seven times
said the suffete scornfully
as the priests hurried , so the people ’ s frenzy increased ; as the number of victims diminished , some cried out that they should be spared , others that more still were needed
these were the flames that had been gleaming from afar on the lake
to please him she has put on the goddess ’ s robe ; and as she yields her body , she delivers up the glory of your name , the majesty of the gods , the country ’ s vengeance , the very salvation of carthage !
with one bound she leaped to the far end of the cell , stooped , and straightened up again with a small dagger in her hand before gringoire even had time to see where the dagger had come from ; angry and proud , her lips puffed out , nostrils flaring , cheeks apple-red , eyes flashing lightning
porters slept in the streets up against the entrance to the houses ; the shadow of the colossi grew longer over the deserted squares ; far off the smoke from a still-burning sacrifice escaped through the bronze tiles , and the heavy breeze carried with the scent of spices the tang of the sea and the odour of walls heated by the sun
you will be repaid in heaven
de venire inferi clamavi , et exaudisti vocem meam , et projecisti me in profundum in corde maris , et flumen circumdedit me
i discover countless things in those stars sprinkled over the black fireback
private debts were considered as public debts , men of canaanite race had the monopoly of trade ; by multiplying the profits of piracy with those of usury , by crude exploitation of the land , the slaves and the poor , some people achieved wealth
this isn ’ t what they told me
but at the top they found a second wall , composed of stones and long beams lying flat , alternating like the pieces of a chessboard
after that he opened his jaws wide , and for a few moments let out a long roar , reflected by echoes from the mountain , which finally died away in the solitude
but she mumbled : he ’ s too skinny , and went away
but he ’ s a devil of a man
did you throw many double sixes last night ?
how lucky you are to have someone who loves you !
now , hanging men of letters is a poor way of being a patron of letters
each hole contained a round , dark stone that looked very heavy
the university looked like one single block
he was jealous of this carthage that contained salammbo , as he would have been of someone who possessed her
that was a near thing !
the poet went on fondly
the two natural exits from this impasse were closed by the portcullis and by the heap of rocks
it had no depth which quasimodo had not penetrated , no height he had not scaled
you can see how i have gnawed at my arms , lord !
at last the gypsy said to him : that does not fill me with as much loathing as you do
he quickened his step
but of darkness , of flames , and not of light
we ’ ll never get in through the door
give your nonsense a rest !
do you see that row of idiotic-looking statues there above the three doorways ?
one evening i had my spinning-wheel going , there ’ s a bang at my door
examples proved that this method compelled the scourge to disappear
there ’ s a staircase for you !
at night he often left carthage , alone , and pressed on beyond the lagoon , towards the mouths of the macar
it seemed to her that the sort of veil which had shrouded her memory was being rent asunder
besides , sire , i am a man of letters
jacques charmolue brought him fully back to reality by asking him : well then , master , when are you coming to help me make gold ?
sparks flew , spurted out ; they were walking through fire
suddenly his majesty turned to the governor of the bastille
it was hardly worth sending you to the slave school at syracuse
gringoire scratched his ear with a very serious look
suddenly , as he swept the great city with that one eye which , by way of compensation , nature had made so piercing that it could almost make up for the other organs which quasimodo lacked , it seemed to him that there was something odd about the outline of the quai de la vieille pelleterie , that something was moving at that point , that the line of the parapet , standing out black against the whiteness of the water , was not straight and still like that of the other quays , but rippling as he watched like waves on a river or the heads of a marching crowd
if your church is sacred , so is our sister ; if our sister is not sacred , neither is your church
behind extended the city , its tall , cube-shaped houses rising in tiers like an amphitheatre
but a fatality dogged the poor foundling
thus in the town you could go in a straight line from the porte saint-antoine to the porte saint-honoré ; in the university from the porte saint-victor to the porte saint-germain
i ’ ve just come from there
they continued , and went on to the end
the argoteers made him stand on the stool
almost everything has disappeared
the moment was brief
which has constantly superimposed itself , without a break or a lapse , on advancing mankind , that monster of a thousand feet ?
they go for each other with their tongues , and that ’ s all
but how did the carthaginians beat you ?
two days later the mercenaries left carthage
all the ash i could wish
and at the same time , with her free hand , she swiftly opened the little bag decorated with green glass beads which she wore round her neck
thus numb , chilled , petrified , she had hardly noticed on two or three occasions the sound of a trapdoor opening somewhere above her , without letting in even a chink of light , and through it a hand throwing her a crust of black bread
in a suburb there were almost as many places of asylum as of execution
the archdeacon and the bell-ringer , as we have already said , were not greatly liked by the people , high or low , who lived near the cathedral
write down the names of the ones who seem to be the bravest , and try to find out if they are loyal to the republic !
a great tumult arose , shaking the staircases , and a mass of people : women , servants , slaves , rushed into the room with spears , clubs , cutlasses , daggers
he said , this will kill that
he added , looking around him at the place de grève : it ’ s a name with echoes around here
right away , said oudarde
so they resolved , in order to weaken barca , to give a share in delivering the republic to the one they favoured , old hanno
it was all shouting and bawling
the man stopped , turned to her and raised his hood
finally , in the intervals between these roofs , these spires , these uneven contours of the innumerable buildings which bent , twisted , and indented so oddly the outer line of the university , one caught a glimpse here and there of some great section of wall , overgrown with moss , a thick round tower , a crenellated city-gate , representing the fortress ; this was philip-augustus ’ s enclosure
on its base some ancient titles of humanity , unrecorded by architecture , have been rewritten
there was no fighting that day , everyone was too exhausted
only at intervals some ragged urchin would stretch up on tiptoe to reach the window sill and shout into the tavern the mocking old cry with which drunkards were then harried : aux houls , drunk , drunk , drunk !
besides , they had no idea how to drill and in his discouragement autharitus did not ask anything more of them
the groves of the king ’ s garden , which covered the western tip of the city , concealed the cowferryman ’ s islet
the poor woman felt her assurance slipping away more and more
our readers have certainly not waited until now to recognize in maître olivier ’ that terrible figaro whom providence , that great dramatist , involved so artistically in the long bloody play of louis xi
what have you to say in your defence ?
the sides to the north and east , defended by the sea and the gulf , remained inaccessible
above the flame , the enormous towers , each showing two sharply distinct faces , one all black , the other all red , seemed bigger still with the immensity of the shadow they projected right up to the sky
now that spirit seemed to have disappeared ; the cathedral seemed dreary and only too glad to be silent
there was one who stood motionless , head bent , not speaking ; his great white beard fell down to his fettered hands ; and the carthaginians , feeling in their innermost hearts as though the republic had collapsed , recognized gisco
the evening of the same day the whole army departed
he would have liked to envelop her , absorb her , drink her in
replied spendius , the temple is empty
besides , she might perhaps obtain the veil and not perish
for , so that others should have no occasion to laugh at him , from the moment that he realized he was deaf he firmly resolved to keep a silence which he hardly ever broke except when he was alone
recovering from his initial stupefaction , he cried with all his might to the four characters on stage : go on !
the capital is increasing only in houses , and what houses !
elephants are all afraid of the sea !
then they passed under a gallery covered over with foliage
the shepherds could be seen running down from the mountains
to think that her shoe is there and that ’ s all !
this was to force the souls to return
cowardly blabbermouth , with a slipper for a helmet !
she will obey you
the goat raised its foreleg and struck the tambourine once
and he angrily threw away the hammer
not for the sake of the house , which is plain and quite unpretentious , but for jehan fourbault ’ s paintings , which brighten up the wainscotting
women leaned over the battlements screaming
to crush them on the isthmus two armies would simultaneously have had to take them in the rear , one landing at the end of the gulf of utica , the second at the mountain of the hot-springs
some swam across , others used their shields
but their feet slipped ; they fell into deep pools
he said , the witch ! —monsieur d ’ estouteville , what were the people wanting to do with her ?
dignitas , says joannes loemnoeus , quae non cum exigua potestate politiam concernente , atque praerogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est [ a dignity which is accompanied by no small power of police , and many prerogatives and rights ]
coictier exclaimed : by heaven , dom claude , alchemy no doubt has its point , but why blaspheme against medicine and astrology ?
the moment was critical
the rich lined up along the mappalia as soon as the cock crowed ; and hitching up their robes practised pike drill
the rugged cathedral was his carapace
they were used to murderous effect ; ethiopian archers went into the baskets ; then , with the cables under control , they stayed suspended in the air shooting poisoned arrows
by the time pierre gringoire reached the place de grève he was numb with cold
talking of which , mademoiselle , that is where i should have begun
we should be bathed in perfumes ; i should have slaves in my turn !
salammbo had left the sacred rhythm
mentally he summoned salammbo to a meeting ; then waited for her
when rats eat cats
i think she ’ s gone to dance some fandango in that house opposite , where they called her in
the priest asked after a silence
let us return to paris and the fifteenth century
he suddenly noticed the long chain which was pulled to operate the gate ’ s drawbridge
captain , it ’ s not the joist that ’ s bothering us , it ’ s the door , laced all over with iron bars
the barbarian was wrong ; hanno was in one of those extremities when all considerations are lost , and besides he so detested hamilcar that on the least hope of salvation he would have sacrificed him and all his soldiers
i felt the draught from it , tête-bœuf !
phoebus planted a mighty kick in his chest with his boot
and no means of saving themselves , no hope !
in any case , these buildings which mark the transition from romanesque to gothic repay study no less than the pure types
one evening , at supper-time , a cracked and heavy sound could be heard coming closer , and far away something red appeared in the rolling landscape
then he put his foot on the ladder to go up
when one councillor remarked that they were all tired and it would be a long time to wait until the torture was finished , the president replied that a magistrate must be ready to sacrifice himself to his duty
before sunset he withdrew
i need money to go and see isabeau la thierrye this evening at the val d ’ amour
i can ’ t tell you
in the middle ages , once a building was completed there was almost as much of it in the ground as outside
the cat-faced old woman came up from the trapdoor first , then phoebus , twirling his moustache , then a third person , the beautiful and graceful figure of la esmeralda
a priest and a philosopher are two different things
aren ’ t you tired of sleeping on the hard ground , drinking the vinegar they serve in camp , always hearing the trumpet call ?
for feeding a rogue and vagabond shut up for the past six months in the cell at the flayers ’ yard , while waiting to learn what to do with him—number livres number sols
and what is this talk , then , of husband and wife ?
she cried , how can i… ?
she did not answer
lord god , i am only a vile sinner ; but my daughter made me pious
salammbo followed him through the entire camp
phoebus was delighted that the first question helped him evade the second
you want to die ?
i promise you one
they would meet next day at sunrise , on the plain of rhades
wipe away , i beseech you , the great drops of sweat streaming from my brow !
mâtho seemed insensible ; suddenly he gathered his forces , and began to run at random , his lips making the sort of noise people make when shivering with intense cold
anyhow , what am i ?
all the stewards followed him
the town of cambrai ,
he belonged to one of those families of middle rank which , in the impertinent language of the last century , were called indifferently upper bourgeoisie or minor nobility
it was getting rusty , he said as he gave it back to her
suddenly exclaimed jacques coictier , what has become of that stabbing pain for which your majesty had me summoned ?
his position was indeed becoming less and less tenable
right at the back , in the shadows of the apse , a gigantic silver cross could just be made out , spread out over a black drape hanging from the vaulting to the pavement
they were taking their revenge for the constraint to which the political ceremonial had just obliged them ; and though they had wanted hamilcar to return , they were angry now that he had not prevented their disasters , or rather had not endured them as they had
and the money it cost !
the unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp
then he put the boy on a stool , by the gold shields
meanwhile the square sparkled with a thousand torches
at least it wouldn ’ t be as dull as listening to those windbags
one of the sergeants of the wand had to draw maître charmolue ’ s attention to this , for , throughout this scene , he had been busy studying the bas-relief of the main doorway which represents , according to some , abraham ’ s sacrifice , according to others the alchemists ’ process , portraying the sun by the angel , the fire by the faggots , the operator by abraham
it is certain that the archdeacon often visited the cemetery of the holy innocents , where his father and mother had been buried , it is true , with the other victims of the plague of number ; but he seemed to pay much less devotion to the cross on their grave than to the strange figures set upon the tomb of nicolas flamel and claude pernelle , erected beside it
she cried , still from the same dark corner of the square
first , turning a blind eye to their revolt , he wanted to detach all the tribes from the barbarians ’ cause ; then , when they were isolated in the midst of the provinces , he would fall on them and wipe them out
behind every bush they met sentries in ambush
i was passing by there this evening
i swear by the holy angels in paradise
he ’ s a monstrous prince
these words were , so to speak , the point of intersection of two scenes which had up to then developed in parallel , simultaneously , each on its own stage ; the one , which you have just read , at the rat-hole , the other , which you are about to read , on the ladder of the pillory
there thus filed by in column of four , wearing the different insignia of their degrees in this strange faculty , most of them disabled in some way , some limping , some with only one arm , the courtauds de boutanche , coquillarts , hubins , sabouleux , calots , francsmitoux , polissons , piètres , capons , malingreux , rifodés , marcandiers , narquois , orphans , archisuppôts , cagoux , an enumeration to make homer weary
i love you—that little mark on your neck , do you still have it ?
it had been a long time since he had last seen the archdeacon , and dom claude was one of those solemn , passionate men an encounter with whom always upsets the balance of a sceptical philosopher
the squad of sergeants surrounding him was attended by the captain of the watch in person , bearing the arms of france embroidered on his chest and those of the town on his back
the captain ’ s one thing , but him !
exquisite scents were evaporating
as a reward he promised new-carthaginians full citizenship
the carthaginians had not yet returned to their homes when the clouds piled up ever more densely ; those who were looking up at the colossus felt large drops on their foreheads , and the rain came down
that ’ s a pity , gisquette replied
his nights were awful
you ’ ll see her hang
to prove the point , it is crowned by an attic storey such as was never seen in athens , a fine straight line , gracefully broken here and there by stove pipes
louis xi gave him a penetrating look
quasimodo made no reply
in the midst of the punic syntagmata the voice of the crier announcing the orders could no longer be heard ; the standards above the dust repeated their signals , and each one went on , carried away in the tide of the great mass surrounding him
come along then , the shadow went on
the clibanarii , whose horses were exhausted , did not try to catch them up
so that the people do not say : where are their gods now ?
eye of baal , may your house flourish !
so he climbed up inside the north tower , while down below the beadle was opening wide the church doors , which at that time were huge panels of stout wood covered in leather , bordered with gilded studs and set in a framework of most skilfully worked ’ sculptures
you ’ ll see how i love you too
but the gate of malqua , the gate of tagaste and the great gate of khamon lay wide open
their heavy cudgels bristled with bronze spikes ; cutlasses flashed against their revoltingly dirty clothes , and they opened their eyes wide in a menacing and surprised look
it was in just such a sump , in the oubliettes excavated by st louis , in the in pace of the tournelle , that they had , doubtless for fear of an escape , deposited la esmeralda , condemned to the gallows , with the colossal palais de justice over her head
from the student , who had begun to be seriously afraid that his knee was going to take on the imprint of his chin
shining and round you skim the mountain tops like a chariot wheel
nothing will unite us , not even hell !
i don ’ t want that girl accosting me in the street
show me your rat-hole , then , so i can give her her cake
they were agnès la herme , jehanne de la tarme , henriette la gaultière , gauchère la violette , all four of them widows , all four bonnes-femmes or religious from the chapel of étienne haudry , who had left their house with their superior ’ s permission , and in accordance with pierre d ’ ailly ’ s statutes , to come and hear the sermon
however , inexperienced and diffident to start with , it opened , broadened out , contained itself , and did not dare soar up into spires and lancets as it did later in so many marvellous cathedrals
the sergeants of the watch cleared a way for it through the crowd with great sweeps of their boullayes
when he could not ravage the fields , he threw stones into them to make them barren
am i a poor man then ?
cried in a voice of thunder a horseman who suddenly emerged from a crossroads nearby
this great bell was called marie
some even thought they could recognize hair , limbs , whole bodies
do you see , compère guillaume ?
he was sorry , he said , to have none of his own blood to offer : and he stared at hamilcar , facing him at the other end of the room
so far no one knew her
i feel that what i am doing is wrong
he sped off over the steps
it ’ s for seven o ’ clock , as you know
a porter , a pastrycook , a baker , two carters , each at number livres a year !
it was as though she was containing herself for fear of being driven away
said jehan to himself , that ’ s a long time to wait for a gold écu !
amid all this witches ’ sabbath he could still be seen up on his pillar , like a cabin boy in the crow ’ s nest
when , at a bend in the gallery overlooking the roof of the side-aisles , he saw the narrow cell with its little window and little door , huddled under a huge flying buttress like a bird ’ s nest under a branch , the poor man ’ s heart failed him , and he leaned against a pillar to stop himself falling
he was the son of a greek orator and a prostitute from campania
monsieur the king ’ s attorney , pierrat said brusquely , what shall we start with ?
gringoire said to him : master , my answer to you is il padelt , which is turkish for god is our hope !
it fell all night , abundantly , in a deluge ; the thunder rumbled ; it was the voice of moloch ; he had conquered tanit , and now made fertile she was opening her vast womb from the heavenly heights
the total comes to number livres number sols number deniers
he put the basket on the ground and said : eat
all the same , you will be aware that noël lescripvain was fined a week ago number sols parisis for carrying a short sword
the arrival of such help did not please the carthaginians as much as the mere sight of these powerful animals sacred to baal ; it was a pledge of his affection , a proof that he was at last going to take a hand in the war for their defence
well then , young gypsy , if neither you nor your goat have any dancing to show us , what are you doing in here ?
some of the elders had stationed themselves on the platform of the towers , and no one knew why at intervals there stood a long-bearded figure in an attitude of meditation
first he had instructed the actors , who had remained in suspended animation , to go on , and to speak more loudly
anyone who could have seen her in such a state , after seeing her laughing and singing in the sunlight , would have shuddered
it grieved him deeply
a wretched bycocket , it is true , but still good for a day of sunshine or a day of rain
hamilcar tolerated them , more from foresightedness than contempt
well now , he said , that ’ s an idea which would never have occurred to me just like that
she let out a cry of joy : oh !
do not despise me because i am weak !
they shouted out that they were soon going to empty those big bellies , brush the gold dust off their skin , and make them drink iron
no , no , he said
there was certainly an element of scorn and mockery in the graceful little grimace
we should add that his deafness to some extent made him also dumb
the poor devil said to her in a low voice
like them we shall leave jehan sleeping under the kindly gaze of the stars , and will follow too , if it please the reader
meanwhile the good lady had stood up irritably
she came forward to face the suffete and they looked at each other for a time ; suddenly hamilcar started ; at a sign of his hand the slaves withdrew
finally the three leaders and the schalischim asked themselves what they now ought to decide
suddenly he stopped , wide-eyed , as if he had discovered his death sentence among the figures
this , thought the priests of moloch , was an outrage he had come to perpetrate against their god ; with sweeping gestures they tried to repulse him
hamilcar did not want to be involved again in any government
when chantefleurie learned these horrible details she did not weep , she moved her lips as though to speak , but could not
ah ! —there ’ s a decree of parliament sending you back to the scaffold
oudarde was insistent : no , sister
with that said , like a body returning to its centre of gravity , he became motionless once more
perhaps that will stop the queen coming to paris in september , put in another
she flies , she ’ s happy , she ’ s just been born ; she seeks the spring , the open air , freedom ; oh !
the man who had acted so rashly was the individual with the bald forehead who , a moment before , blending with the group round the gypsy girl , had chilled the poor girl with his menacing and hateful words
hamilcar had recommended the taking of prisoners
first you will languish , light as a vapour hovering over the water ; and after longer trials and suffering you will depart into the centre of the sun , the very source of intelligence !
when you have children , oudarde , you will know that there ’ s nothing prettier than such tiny hands and feet
he said between his teeth
we shall not attempt to give any idea of her gestures , her tone , the tears she swallowed as she spoke , the way she clasped and then wrung her hands , her heart-rending smiles , her tearful glances , the groans , the sighs , the chilling cries of misery mingled with her muddled , crazy , incoherent words
men in scarlet cloaks removed him from the enclosure ; then , once outside , he went round all the colleges in turn , and the priest , henceforth without a god , disappeared into the crowd , which drew away at his approach
thybalde aleatorl [ thibaut the gambler ] silly old fool !
on his left he had the succentor , on his right the precentor armed with his staff of office
it ’ s because i think i recognize him
she was more cut off from the world than quasimodo !
monsieur the provost , i ’ m a soldier and it ’ s not my business to hang witches
the windows of the gondelaurier mansion , however , stayed lit up , even after midnight
he went right up to the edge , lay on his back , and , feet first , slid all the way down to the bottom ; then he swam to the cape of tombs , made a wide detour by the salt lagoon , and by evening had returned to the barbarians ’ camp
he ’ s a sponge for soaking up money laid upon the people
the king replied with a smile of satisfaction that he tried in vain to disguise
then they seated him on a gaudy litter
he returned that same evening
an old bully addressed him
it was one of those spectres , half light , half shade , such as one sees in dreams and in goya ’ s extraordinary works , pale , motionless , sinister , crouched on a grave or leaning against the bars of a dungeon
what is he called ?
pale , fists clenched , he quivered like a harp whose strings are about to snap
yet over it all lay so much sadness and gentleness that she began to get used to it
the barbarians still expected to see mâtho appear – and they were unwilling to leave the mountain from discouragement , weariness , the obstinacy of sick men who refuse to move ; finally , when provisions were exhausted , the zuaces went away
he might still land at the cape of grapes , and thence march on one of the towns
such generosity amazed the barbarians ; some were terrified , and mâtho was sorry that the spokesman had not been killed
and , going inside the building , who overthrew that colossal saint christopher , proverbial among statues just as the great hall of the palais was among halls , the spire of strasbourg among steeples ?
when he came to the porte baudoyer he made straight for the stone cross standing in the middle of the square , as if he had been able to distinguish in the darkness the figure of a man dressed and hooded in black sitting on the steps of the cross
no one had yet noticed in the gallery of the statues of the kings , carved immediately above the arches of the doorway , a strange spectator who had so far been observing everything so impassively , his neck so outstretched , his face so deformed , that but for his costume , half red and half violet , he could have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose jaws the cathedral ’ s long gutters have been discharging for six hundred years
there are some words on it that we can ’ t understand
the archdeacon could feel this pipe slowly giving way
then they pushed against the walls drills which would loosen them when applied to the joints between the blocks
from their houses the carthaginians heard the fanfare of the trumpets controlling the exercises
they told us at the châtelet that they were taking him to the pillory straightaway
she writhed , with her lovely body half naked on his knees
devil take the bishop of paris and his water-mills !
but the slope was too steep , and he had no strength left
hurry up there and pull your boy along
he thought of the wretched lot dealt him by providence , how women , love , sensual delight would everlastingly pass before his eyes , how he would only ever see the bliss of others
the bell-ringer retreated a step or two behind the archdeacon , and suddenly , rushing at him furiously , pushed him in the back with both his huge hands , down into the abyss over which dom claude was leaning
she pushed him away and clung to gringoire ’ s sleeve , while he , in his turn , busy with the goat , almost pushed her away
as long as you are completely cured , my phoebus !
in this way he could see everything that was going on in the next room
i mustn ’ t stay too long
above our heads a double ogive vault , panelled with wooden carvings , painted sky-blue , sprinkled with golden fleurs-de-lys , beneath our feet a marble pavement with alternate slabs of black and white
phoebus found the moment ’ suitable for stealing another kiss , adding to the torment of the wretched archdeacon in his corner
right , he murmured almost aloud , it is obvious that the king is unwell today
all right , my dear fellow , rejoined charmolue , leave it open
a long pile of black ashes smoked on the libyans ’ site ; the earth rippled like the sea where it had been churned up and the tents , with the canvas torn to shreds , looked vaguely like ships half wrecked on reefs
she noticed a path in the thickness of the rampart
i declare this bold metaphor to be admirable , and maintain that natural history in the theatre , on a day of allegory and royal epithalamium , has no cause for offence in a dolphin being son of a lion
they thought that some of their number , remaining behind in the city ( for they did not know how many they were ) were amusing themselves by pillaging a temple
why , there ’ s a maypole and a bonfire in the town ; a mystery play , pope of fools , and a flemish embassy in the city ; and in the university not a thing !
he said rather timidly :
but soon the barbarians set up , opposite , an immense raft to prevent the carthaginians from coming out
or was she speaking of the barbarians ?
the priest lifted up his hood
he tore his knees , broke his nails , then fell back into the water and made his way back
he clung to life
a short while ago she had been singing among the tables ; she had disappeared , and from that moment he had been continually climbing these stairs
it was , as we have said , the mother ’ s last rampart
spendius was untiring in directing them
whereupon he hurled his cap at the wall and clicked his fingers like castanets
should he rouse the gypsy ?
here alone lies truth ’ ( as he spoke he had picked up from the chest a phial full of the powder mentioned earlier ) , here alone is light !
he remembered that dom claude was the only person with a key to the staircase leading to the cell , he recalled his nocturnal attempts on the girl , the first of which quasimodo had assisted , the second prevented
a candelabra carved all over with flowers burned at the back , and each of its golden branches held a byssus wick in a diamond cup
the strange faces which came one after another to grind their teeth at the rose-window were so many brands thrown on the fire
a long shudder ran through her whole body from head to foot , her teeth chattered , she half raised her head , and , pressing her elbows tightly against her hips and taking her feet in her hands as if to warm them , she said : oh !
men wearing ragged cloaks , as a sign of despair , stood at the corners of crossroads
but for its form as a building it would have found itself being publicly burned at the hand of the executioner in the form of manuscript , had it been unwise enough to risk appearing thus
he cast a haggard eye over the tortuous double path which fatality had made their two destinies follow up to their point of intersection , where fatality again had smashed them mercilessly against each other
it was neither woman nor man , nor living creature , nor definite shape ; it was a figure ; a sort of vision where reality and fantasy intersected like darkness and daylight
well now , upon my soul , joannes went on , it ’ s clopin trouillefou
she went to pick up the hanging amphorae by the neck ; she cooled her breast beneath the large fans , or amused herself burning cinnamon in hollow pearls
he was beginning to understand
the pontiffs of moloch walked over the great slab , examining the crowd
she saw in a dream blurred stars passing under her feet
such is the cathedral of rouen , which would be entirely gothic if the tip of its central spire did not dip into the renaissance zonenumber
their huts , of seaweed and slime , clung to the cliff like larks ’ nests
he bent over and whispered in compère tourangeau ’ s ear in a voice too low to be heard by the archdeacon : i warned you that he was mad
a herald was immediately dispatched
it ’ s the end of manuscripts , the end of books !
the barrier was lowered ; she was at once in the barbarians ’ camp
his eminence is at this moment accompanying the most honourable embassy of monsieur the duke of austria ; which is being delayed at the present moment while they listen to the address of monsieur the rector of the university at the porte baudets
a moment later she put a finger to her lips and beckoned to mahiette to come and look
look out that you don ’ t finish on the cross !
every evening , for a good hour
those irregular teeth , with gaps here and there like the battlements of a fortress , that calloused lip , over which one of those teeth protruded like an elephant ’ s tusk , that cleft chin , and above all the facial expression extending over the whole , a mixture of malice , amazement , and sadness
above it you can see the very delicately pierced bell tower
his absence leaves a vacuum which is felt only too keenly today
he ’ s not a clerk , he ’ s a layman
two coals seemed to burn in place of his eyes , which had no eyebrows left ; a mass of wrinkled skin hung down over his forehead ; his two ears , standing our from his head , were beginning to swell , and the deep creases which made semicircles around his nostrils gave him a strange and frightening look , like that of a wild beast
since the death of madame rolande it had rarely been vacant for a year or two
jehan prepared for a violent clash , but the deaf man stayed motionless ; he had simply turned towards the student and was looking at him
on my way back i saw the rock white with their bones !
at about one o ’ clock in the morning the guests began to leave
the name reassured her
see , eye of baal , he said , indicating a sturdy libyan , there is one we caught with a rope round his neck
was i then such a miserable creature , lord , that you couldn ’ t look at me before condemning me ?
then , behind the town , at the back of megara , higher than the acropolis , appeared hamilcar ’ s palace
supposing the priests had hidden it ?
the domes in the ceiling filtered through their gratings a pale light which projected something like luminous discs on the water , and the darkness around , thickening against the walls , pushed further back endlessly
the general characteristics of popular masonry on the other hand are variety , progress , originality , opulence , perpetual motion
she turned her head in the direction of the call , her shining eyes fixed on phoebus , and she stopped dead
she was full of despair at having seen the zaïmph , and yet this gave her a kind of joy , an intimate pride
at that moment the clock of notre-dame slowly struck noon
what should he do ?
first of all people in the town must be dissatisfied
what have you done with her ?
soon the mass , too compressed , ceased to advance : pikes clashed in the air and the barbarians ’ arrows smashed against the walls
they say king louis xi is in paris
in three days it had completed the march from sicca , to come and exterminate everything in carthage
in the front rows numerous venerable figures are already seated , in their ermine , velvet , and scarlet hoods
lastly , a third audience , the noisiest , jolliest , and most numerous , jammed the benches and tables in the midst of which a shrill voice was perorating and swearing from beneath a set of heavy armour , complete from helmet to spurs
poland , catalonia , valogne , i always confuse those three provinces
the suffete learned this and could expect no help !
claude frollo ( for we presume that the reader , more intelligent than phoebus , has seen in all this adventure no other bogeyman-monk than the archdeacon ) , claude frollo groped about for a moment or two in the dark recess where the captain had bolted him in
agathocles , regulus , caepio , any man of courage has only to land to take it ; and when the libyans in the east come to an understanding with the numidians in the west , when the nomads come from the south and the romans from the north… ’ a cry of horror arose : oh !
with each slash he traced around him a ring of severed limbs
is all in fine array
you swell the seashells !
narr ’ havas reminded him that he had exterminated hanno ’ s last cohorts – as for elephants , they were being hunted in the forests , he was arming soldiers , the horses were on the way ; and the numidian , stroking the ostrich plume which fell down on his shoulder , rolled his eyes like a woman and smiled irritatingly
why did narr ’ havas not return ?
now in some dim corner of the church you would collide with a kind of living chimera , squatting with a scowl ; it was quasimodo thinking
may the devil squash your nose ! —this is a fine beelzebub ’ s tavern where the wenches use the forks for combs !
he became an expert on fevers and contusions , wounds and abscesses
they probed and pried with their malicious words into her poor outlandish costume of sequins and gaudy rags
as our good plautus says :
once a wretched being had been buried down there it meant farewell to daylight , fresh air , life , ogni speranza [ all hope ]
what does the word la esmeralda mean ?
it ’ s our prince from yesterday , our pope of fools , our bell-ringer , our one-eyed , grimacing hunchback !
the suffete needed soldiers : he would accept then unconditionally , so much did he admire their bravery
i ’ d rather give suck to a vampire
on his return to the sacristy he had ripped off alb , stole , and cope , tossed the lot into the hands of the astonished beadle ; he had made his escape through the concealed door into the cloister , ordered a boatman from the terrain to take him across to the left bank of the seine , and had plunged into the steep streets of the university , without any idea where he was going , at every step running into bands of men and women gleefully hurrying towards the pont saint-michel in the hope of getting there in time ’ to see the witch hanged ; he was pale , distraught , more confused , more blind , more unapproachable than a night bird released and pursued by a pack of children in broad daylight
blood showered up into the foliage , and red shapeless masses howled as they writhed at the foot of the trees
he himself tightened the skeins of the balistae
i am not the king ’ s doctor , and his majesty has not given me the daedalus garden so that i can observe the constellations from it—don ’ t lose your temper , listen to me—what truth have you drawn , i won ’ t say from medicine , which is much too foolish , but from astrology ?
she bowed her head
all those fine red copes !
at night all that could be distinguished of this mass of buildings was the dark serrated outline of the roofs unfolding their chain of acute angles round the place
never had a living creature come so close to nothingness
zarxas , among the balearics , stayed stretched out full length , hair over his arms , inert
then gradually as the sound increases they merge , blend , coalesce , all combine in one magnificent concert
that ’ s fair enough , isn ’ t it
spendius held him back ; on the morning of the sixth he left
fashions have done more harm than revolutions
advance was impossible ; it looked like a sea full of leaping red plumes with bronze scales , and the light-coloured shields rolling about like silver spray
the beer and cider vendors are rolling their barrels among the groups of people
then tortuous lines , the rues de la plâtrerie , de la verrerie , de la tixanderie , coiled over the whole
phoebus , my beloved phoebus , do you see me ?
that doesn ’ t seem as clear to me as it does to you , maître pierre
and i can put an end to it whenever i choose to put on a frown
in such misfortune , in such a dungeon , she could no longer distinguish sleeping from waking , dream from reality , day from night
this is what we do
this only made their thirst more intolerable : and they had always before their eyes the long cascade of the clear water falling from the aqueduct
yet quasimodo was still there
you are provost-marshal , you have the men of your provostry ; take them
she stood up , however , at an order from the guard , and walked quite steadily , preceded by charmolue and the priests from the officiality , between two rows of halberds , to a side door , which opened suddenly and closed behind her , making the dejected gringoire think of horrible jaws which had just devoured her
and the soldier ’ s kisses , more devouring than flames , ran over her ; she was as though swept away in a hurricane , caught in the power of the sun
she owed that nature to the wandering life she had always led
think about all that and hold your tongue
men from every nation were there , ligurians , lusitanians , balearics , negroes , and fugitives from rome
the surface of this throng was grey , dirty , muddy
this book of granite was begun in the orient , carried on by greek and roman antiquity , and the last page was written in the middle ages
he felt vaguely uneasy with this man , who was at once so cowardly and so terrible
both parties had to put up with that
what does that mean—la esmeralda ?
the king ’ s horsemen , in the midst of whom phoebus de châteaupers bore himself valiantly , gave no quarter , and the edge of the sword cut down any who escaped the thrust
a priest i don ’ t know
he came back to mâtho , took his arm
monsieur , the stout man answered with a yawn , what for ?
i have always been kind !
he understood her mime
in her inmost heart she was grateful to him for it
his tone was now sorrowful and gentle , contrasting painfully with the lofty harshness of his features
he remained for a moment without answering
the parvis was full of dense smoke which musket volleys streaked with fire
but narr ’ havas , going on , compared his desires to flowers drooping for want of rain , lost travellers waiting for the dawn
what would you say then , and what would become of your office , if i were a king like king chilperic , whose habit it was to hold his beard in his hand ?
there was quite a wide crack in the worm-eaten door to his hole
to henriet cousin , master executioner of the justice of paris , the sum of number sols parisis , taxed and ordered to him by my lord the provost of paris , for purchasing , on the orders of the said monsieur the provost , one large broadsword to be used for executing and beheading those persons condemned by justice for their misdeeds , and providing it with a scabbard and all appurtenances ; and likewise refurbishing and renovating the old sword , which had been splintered and chipped in carrying out sentence on messire louis de luxembourg , as may appear more fully … ’
for the rest it had no windows or skylight , and the sloping angle of the roof made it impossible to stand up inside
she refused the coat as she had refused the flask and cake , and answered : a sack
my lord , one of the archers said suddenly , ask the old hag why the bars on her window are all broken like that
suddenly a great galloping of horses filled the neighbouring streets , and with a long line of torches and a dense column of riders , riding with bridles dropped and lances ready , furious sounds swept through the square like a hurricane : france !
so that ’ s why my heart leaped each time you went by
the bronze arms went faster
he stayed mouth agape , head lowered , eyes fixed
they felt the need to transfer to others the surplus fury they had been unable to use against themselves
as she went past a lighted window , she made an effort , stiffened up abruptly , and cried : help !
when there were no weapons left to hold they wrestled bodily with each other ; chests cracked against breastplates and corpses hung with head thrown back between stiffening arms
by all kinds of tricks hamilcar won over the village chiefs ; and the mercenaries were driven off , repulsed , tracked down like wild beasts
don ’ t be afraid , said a voice not unknown to her , it ’ s me
she hurried to get dressed
i have been shivering now for fourteen years in an iron cage
to ensure complete equality in their twin tensions , their cords were tightened by striking alternately to right and to left , until both sides sounded the same
despite the servants , someone wanted to come in ; and as the noise increased hamilcar ordered the unknown person to be let in
he took a still smoking ember and threw it contemptuously on to the debris of his tent
gringoire could not stand it
her ardour rose at the gleam of the naked swords ; she cried out with open arms
what was strange and profound about this impression was that it was indeed the strasbourg steeple , but a strasbourg steeple two leagues high , something incredible , gigantic , immeasurable , a structure such as had been seen by no human eye , a tower of babel
he was intending to incorporate the best of them into his troops and thus to promote defections
she repeated in alarm
round their mouths , fixed by two bronze chains , they wore a muzzle , to make it impossible for them to eat the flour , and their hands were encased in fingerless gloves to prevent them taking any
sometimes a whole town which needed repopulating was temporarily made a place of refuge
so it ’ s you , maître !
at that word , which had the same effect as the order to mount on a halted regiment , all the truands , men , women , children , rushed in a body out of the tavern with a great clatter of arms and old iron
suddenly you began to sing
meanwhile good dame aloïse , delighted to see them leaning together whispering like this , said as she played with the clasps of her book of hours : what a touching love scene !
the best tried to dig mines ; the ground caved in for want of proper support
well , sister , you should rejoice , said the priest , glacial as a statue on a tomb , she ’ s the one you are going to see die
the recluse had gone to sit down by her daughter , putting her own body in front of her as a shield , her eyes staring , listening to the poor child who did not stir and whose only utterance was a low murmur : phoebus !
they stripped him of shirt and doublet down to his waist , he let them do it
it pains us to have to add that , given the rigours of the season , he was using his tongue as a handkerchief
the priest had lied !
he saw and heard nothing more
monsieur , you are the only representative of the muses here , said gringoire
assuming that he was some groom who had lost his way , the usher stopped him
the barbarians still could not climb them
he was almost as fond of the goat
from time to time the old lady addressed him in an undertone , and he replied as best he could with a clumsy and constrained sort of politeness
and now he is praising the romans !
he must have mixed up the cases !
but narr ’ havas , warned by his nurse ’ s son , had fallen upon cirta , poisoned the victors with water from their reservoirs , lopped off a few heads and restored order , so that he arrived more furious with the suffete than the barbarians
dragging out his words , he imitated salammbo ’ s voice , while his outstretched hands simulated two light hands playing on the cords of a lyre
then the barbarians heard a great cry
she was pale , she was sombre
ought i to have let them hang you ?
this was the opinion of the veterans , that of mâtho himself , and it was decided that spendius would go and attack utica , mâtho hippo-zarytus ; the third army corps , based on tunis , would occupy the plain of carthage
or rather crush your face against the ground !
none of them was the captain
that night la esmeralda had gone to sleep in her cell , filled with oblivion , hope , and sweet thoughts
once you used to obey ; now you command an army , and if carthage is not conquered , we shall at least be granted the provinces ; we shall become kings !
and if they appear i will crush them like vipers !
no , she answered ; and the eyes she had just closed out of fear she opened again out of curiosity
at night , alone in his tent , he contemplated the zaïmph
all right , oudarde went on , offering her a flask , there ’ s some hippocras to warm you up
the common people , especially in the middle ages , are to society what the child is to the family
suddenly the recluse cried out , as though the gypsy ’ s question had taken all that time to get through to her mind : what have you done to me ?
let ’ s see , my djali , have you forgotten any of your pretty tricks ?
they wanted both to be convinced of his death and share in it
he heard them bawling out the old refrain :
may god have mercy on your soul !
it is an extreme point
there was no more room for doubt ; the gypsies had held their sabbath on that heath , and had devoured the child in the company of beelzebub , as the mohammedans do
his chest heaved , his teeth were chattering
at the same time the two assistants began rummaging through their hideous arsenal
suddenly he turned round towards gringoire
i ’ ll come to the point now !
the girl looked at him again , then she flushed as though a flame had risen in her cheeks , and tucking her tambourine under her arm , she made her way through the astonished onlookers towards the door of the house from which phoebus had called to her , slowly , unsteadily , and with the troubled look of a bird surrendering to the fascination of a snake
this apparition , which had always been so fateful for her and had driven her from misfortune to misfortune as far as the torture chamber , roused her from her torpor
meanwhile impatience gave way to anger
then , the choice must fall exclusively on the great families
then he took off his parti-coloured surcoat , and they saw hanging from his right hand a thin , slender whip of long , white , shiny , knotted , plaited thongs , armed with metal hooks
that ’ s a devilish bad start , gringoire observed
he tried to soften her with soothing words , as one does with someone who is angry
then they went round the hot-springs mountain to avoid autharitus – and progressed so slowly that instead of catching the barbarians by surprise one morning , as the suffete had calculated , they only arrived in mid-afternoon on the third day
but now it was impossible to know how many mercenaries had been hired , and the elders were appalled at the exorbitant sum they would have to pay
no doubt the spokesmen had given themselves to the suffete
then he vaguely felt waken within him a jealousy he had never expected , a jealousy which made him go red with shame and indignation
schahabarim bit his lips
they had all climbed the ladder to come up on stage
she had realized that after trying to love a robber , the only man who might have wanted her ; but after a little while she saw that the robber despised her
she clung to it as to her very life
then when the sun had completely set , he disappeared behind the nopal hedge , and that evening , at the assembly of the rich , in the temple of eschmoûn , he said as he went in :
all lands toiled around you , and the plains of the sea , ploughed by your oars , cradled your harvests
in phoenician architecture one is aware of the merchant , in greek of the republican , in gothic of the citizen
compère , said louis xi , two companies of my men-at-arms and a volley from the serpentines would make short work of a mob of the common people
hell ’ s teeth , gringoire objected , i ’ ll break my neck
now , as regards the number marcs , i haven ’ t yet been able to get them together
claude with his limping companion ! ]
but the latins were grieved not to be able to collect the ashes in urns ; the nomads missed the hot sands in which bodies become mummified , and the celts missed the three rough stones , beneath a rainy sky , deep in a bay full of islands
is it because it ’ s printed ?
she said , still glacial and unmoving ; then why do you talk to me of living ?
in the middle , on an island , stood a house for the marine suffete
none of these beauties had been felt or understood
the sun is becoming a nuisance
when the boatman had taken himself off , he remained standing on the bank in a stupor , looking straight ahead and now seeing objects only through magnifying oscillations which turned everything into a kind of phantasmagoria
said gringoire , clasping his hands in despair
thirst tortured them still more , for they had not a drop of water , the waterskins being completely empty since the ninth day
mâtho slipped forward ; a stone gave under his heel , and the spheres began to turn , the monsters to roar ; a sound of music rose , melodious and booming as the harmony of the planets ; the turbulent soul of tanit streamed forth expansively
at last the truands gave in
the nile rat kills the crocodile , the swordfish kills the whale , the book will kill the building
but almost all , feeling this cold flesh on their lips , let their hands fall back ; others , on the contrary , devoured it with delight
captain , answered the deaf man , aren ’ t you going to ask who it is ?
upon my soul , exclaimed jehan , that can only be my friend captain phoebus !
how is it that you haven ’ t once been to see me ?
at length , dense though the darkness was , he saw the head of a column debouching from that street , and in an instant a crowd spreading out over the square , of which all that could be made out in the darkness was that it was a crowd
this chapel , still new , its construction dating from barely six years before , was all conceived with that delightful taste for delicate architecture , wonderful sculpture , precise and deeply incised tracery which in france marks the end of the gothic age and survives until about the middle of the sixteenth century in the magical fantasies of the renaissance
i can see what ’ s bothering you , the poet went on ; with all this noise you can ’ t hear properly
he listened to it in a kind of trance , as if oblivious of all else
then she stood up , and with a light touch of her finger raised a lock of hair which was hanging too low
oh , what is the point !
you will have to go and turn the mill in suburra and harvest the grapes on the hills of latium
then she dropped her arms in dejection , and remained sitting , with head bowed , eyes fixed on the ground , mute , continuing to tremble
he invents traps for wild beasts
his head rang on the stone floor
he still hesitated a while , however , before mounting his horse
the walls of the three old quarters , now mixed together , were still distinguishable ; they rose here and there like great reefs , or extended huge sections – half covered with flowers , blackened , widely streaked where rubbish had been thrown down , and streets passed through their gaping apertures like rivers under bridges
when he came back to the streets , the passers-by jostling in the glow from the shop fronts appeared to him like spectres going everlastingly to and fro around him
the young ladies were sitting , some inside , some on the balcony , some on cushions of utrecht velvet with gold corner pieces , others on oaken stools carved with flowers and figures
the suffete ’ s mildness was a bait to catch them
it was the cry of the prophet who already hears the clamorous swarming of emancipated mankind , who foresees intelligence undermining faith , opinion dethroning belief , the world shaking off rome
i can quite believe that you won ’ t make gold with this
then they were brought to the temple of tanit , where the priestesses were charged with the duty of keeping them occupied and fed until the solemn day
monsieur , he said , turning to one of his neighbours , a stout , patient-looking worthy , supposing they began again ?
it ’ s quite impossible , isn ’ t it ?
don ’ t you think , the archdeacon answered with an air of profound reflection , that the riders we have just seen are dressed more handsomely than you or i ?
they were marching through a kind of large gulley , flanked by two chains of reddish dunes , when a sickening stench struck their nostrils , and on top of a carob-tree they seemed to see something extraordinary : a lion ’ s head rose above the leaves
jehan , on whom his back was turned , could see only his shoulders and the back of his skull ; but he had no difficulty recognizing that bald head on which nature had imposed an eternal tonsure , as if wanting to mark by some outward symbol the archdeacon ’ s irresistible clerical vocation
and doesn ’ t she move that neck quite charmingly , like a swan ?
sparks , carried by the wind , scattered far and wide , and in the mountains whole forests burned , surrounding the valleys with a wreath of fire ; they were forced to wait before they could go through
no one had such experience of administrative affairs
from that moment on he dismissed gisquette from his mind
townsfolk , students , and law clerks had set to work
said hamilcar in a low voice
the man with the curved blade approached gisco
he hoped anyway that the affair would not become public , that in his absence his name would hardly be mentioned , and would in any case not send echoes beyond the proceedings at the tournelle
suppose i had another plan ! —i warn you that at this very instant a most luminous inspiration has occurred to me , —suppose i had an expedient idea for extricating her from this predicament without compromising my neck with the slightest slip-knot ?
however , we shall spare no pains to get at the truth
let me take the girl
they are pursuing you !
the carthaginians came down the rampart and , attacking them from the rear , killed them at leisure
then she went to fetch from a corner of the cell a big paving-stone which served her as a pillow , and hurled it at the bars so violently that one broke in a shower of sparks
others thought that he should be carried round on a dromedary , after they had first stuck into various parts of his body wicks soaked in oil – and they liked the idea of the great animal wandering round the streets with this man twisting beneath the fires like a candelabra shaken by the wind
but an unknown man came in , soaked with sweat , frightened , with bleeding feet , and belt undone ; his breathing shook his skinny ribs to bursting point , and speaking an unintelligible dialect , he opened his eyes wide , as if describing some battle
it ’ s like the doge of venice going to wed the sea
there were five or six of these mansions on the quay , from the logis de lorraine , which shared with the bernardins the great enclosure adjacent to the tournelle , to the hôtel de nesle , whose main tower marked the boundary of paris , and whose pointed roofs were privileged for three months in the year to interpose their black triangles upon the scarlet disc of the setting sun
his whole bearing expressed a feeling of discomfort and tedium which our modern subalterns on garrison duty would render admirably by : what a frightful chore !
at sunset taanach took away the black felt diamonds which closed the openings in the wall ; then her doves , rubbed with musk like tanit ’ s doves , suddenly came in , and their pink feet slid on the glass pavement among the grains of barley which she threw at them in handfuls , like a sower in a field
she could not live without the relief of his presence
the captain was so sure that the affair of la esmeralda was over that he hardly reacted to fleur-de-lys ’ s words
paris mud has a particularly nasty stench
the archdeacon nodded his head with a bitter smile
all they felt was ever increasing anger ; and one day they found themselves in the gorges of cobus , once again before carthage !
who did you rob last night in the rue coupe-gueule ?
drunkenness made him still more gloomy
from holes in the pearl there fell from time to time a tiny drop which wet her bare shoulder as it fell
at the same time the shadow spoke : captain phoebus de châteaupers !
suddenly she trembled in every limb , covered the relic with frantic kisses , and burst out sobbing as though her heart had broken
i have not seen , any more than you have , the chaldean stone buildings constructed on the sacred model of the sikra , nor solomon ’ s temple , now destroyed , nor the stone doors of the sepulchre of the kings of israel , now shattered
as for joannes frollo de molendino , as an archdeacon ’ s brother it was on the red cassock that he launched his bold assault , and he sang at the top of his voice , staring shamelessly at the cardinal : cappa repleta mero ’ [ a cope filled with wine ]
no one sits on their banner any more like that today , i swear
not so loud , master !
facing them were the people , and in front of the door and the table numerous provost sergeants in purple camlet tunics with white crosses
meanwhile all the beggars , all the lackeys , all the cutpurses had joined the students and gone in procession to fetch from the lawyers ’ wardrobe the pasteboard tiara and mock chimer kept for the pope of fools
mâtho ’ s eyes kept constantly coming back to it
said the priest , gripping her violently by the arm
matthias corvinus showed favour to jean de monroyal , the ornament of mathematics
our expenses increase every year
they are still making the devil of a row in the cité
in the middle rose a massive building with eight equal wings
it was not merely a fine town at that time ; it was a homogeneous town , the architectural and historical product of the middle ages , a chronicle in stone
that ’ s a lot of sergeants !
among his soldiers , at the edge of the tents , men slept almost naked on their backs , or with head against an arm held up by their breastplate
the duke of egypt , sitting on a marker-stone , was gazing with religious dread at the fantastic bonfire blazing two hundred feet up in the air
then paquette la chantefleurie burst out laughing like a hyena
he did not see houses , or pavements , or carts , or men and women , but a chaotic jumble of indeterminate objects merging at the edges into one another
then she examined her cell
all the other arts were obedient and submitted to the discipline of architecture
the shock brought the girl back to her senses
we have a good memory
there was not so much left as one of those wretched camichons that sell for five sous the pound
his wide jewelled collar flapped up to his ears
i think it is still bleeding
here ’ s the gypsy girl !
as for gringoire , once his initial depression had passed , he had recovered his composure
then he felt afraid , he put his hands over his ears so that he should hear no more , turned his back so that he should see no more , and strode away from the fearful vision
on the first day there was even more talk of them than of the citizens who had died
the people ran up , some of them plunged in to swim
and the cathedral was not just society to him , but the universe as well , the whole of nature
what made the situation intolerable above all was the idea that it would become worse
i am possessed by this fixed idea , and it is making my brain wither like dried clover
you will avenge yourself
the archers had left it to hunt down the witch in the cité
after a few minutes the sound of the river told them that they were on the pont saint-michel , at that time all built up with houses
meanwhile jacques coictier had heard his companion ’ s question with a resentment which dom claude ’ s reply only increased
which will be quite right
at this unfortunate question a roar of laughter went up from the clerks to the public , so violent , uncontrollable , contagious , and universal that the two deaf men could not help noticing
it ’ s a real monster of abomination , this so-called foundling , jehanne went on
cuthroat , yes , cutpurse , no
its quayside , though broken or interrupted in several places , ran along the seine , from the tour de billy to the tour du bois , that is from the place where the grenier d ’ abondance stands today to where the tuileries are
the mercenaries , learning from their defeats , did not want to risk themselves in useless engagements ; and neither side was in a hurry , knowing that a fearful action was about to commence and that the result would be either victory or complete extermination
thus churches , palaces , fortresses had earth up to their waists
there he was , clasping the spout , hardly breathing , no longer stirring , left with no other movement than that contraction of the belly we experience in dreams when we think we are falling
the whole of paris lay at his feet , with the countless spires of its buildings and its circle of gentle hills on the horizon , with its river winding under the bridges and its people flowing through the streets , with the cloud of smoke rising from its chimneys , with its steep roofs pressing round notre-dame in a close-knit chain
they defended themselves like desperate men
here and there a palm-tree leaned over on a sand-dune , pines and oaks dotted the sides of precipices
they saw in the distance a troop of horsemen galloping on horses without reins
she made her crouch down , carefully arranging her so that neither her hand nor her foot emerged from the darkness , undid her black hair and spread it over her white dress to conceal it , and put the pitcher and paving-stone , the only furniture she had , in front of the girl , imagining that the pitcher and paving stone would hide her
all they could see was his white beard , the gleam of his headdress and the triple collar of broad blue plates swinging against his chest
and with a look full of infinite adoration :
their strength , their armour , their discipline ?
their limbs struck against the sides of the canal which was too narrow
i don ’ t know , my lord , i may have been mistaken
by then the inner walls shone less brightly
or because the buckle of his old swordbelt from montlhéry had been pulled too tight , and constricted his provostial girth in too military a fashion ?
she recognized monsieur the archdeacon of josas , a saintly man
the ethiopians of bambotus hid little poison darts in their hair
so his grandfather says he ’ ll be a captain—just let me catch you again , monsieur eustache
so each sunrise found her more at peace , breathing more easily , less pale
readers will not have forgotten the mysterious cell that the archdeacon had reserved for himself in that tower
mistress falourdel , have you brought the dry leaf into which the écu given you by the demon was changed ?
what does it matter to you ?
three important things are today missing from that façade
into the ditch were thrown turf , stakes , stones , and carts with their wheels on , to fill it up faster ; before it was full , the immense throng of barbarians rippled over the plain in a single movement , and struck against the foot of the walls like a tidal wave
said the slave ; the streets were empty
noisy calls rose up , followed by a long silence
then i fell down in the window embrasure , stiffer and weaker than a dislodged statue
up there , my beauty , hold yourself up a bit , said maître pierrat as he raised her
the entire punic infantry turned back on the barbarians , and cut them in two
yet it is certain that quasimodo could have squashed the priest just with his thumb
then the ground fell away and obelisks , domes , houses appeared : it was carthage !
in the other direction , over towards the pont notre-dame , the poor condemned girl thought she could hear the sound of cavalry coming closer
you haven ’ t found anything new in his house ?
the recluse ’ s whole body shook , she stood up on bare feet and sprang at the window with such blazing eyes that mahiette , oudarde , the other woman , and the boy retreated as far as the parapet on the quay
his royal headband , half undone , dragged in the dust with his white hair
i saw him go past in his great red cloak , his arms raised , above all the dust , like an eagle flying on the cohorts ’ flank ; and each time he signalled with his head they closed in or pressed on ; the crowd pulled us towards each other : he looked at me ; i felt a chill in my heart like a sword blade
for months now he has been pursuing me , threatening me , frightening me !
that ’ s for charles vi to go through !
lex dun carminis [ law of the harsh formula ]
what could i do , wretch that i am ?
he poured perfume on his head ; put an amber necklace round his neck , and on his feet a pair of pearl-heeled sandals – his daughter ’ s own sandals !
the boat moved slowly towards the right bank
all leapt up and ran to the rampart
then he put it back on to his breast and all , as if seized with sudden anger , cried :
cried the terrified mother
every day the sun turning round the hill , forsook the bottom of the gorge from the early hours and left them in the shade
suddenly he remembered that masons had been working all day to repair the wall , the timber framework and the roofing of the south tower
they kept their mockery rather for other men
what did he do shut up like that ?
i wanted to consult you on two points , one concerning my health , the other my stars
in this way , under the pretext of building churches to god , the art developed into one of magnificent proportions
it brought back her beauty
he did not dare tell the young man that he knew his brother the archdeacon , whom he had not been back to see since the scene in the church , an omission which embarrassed him
my lord , a soldier said , he ’ s vanished
they hung on to each other by their rags
at length madame aloïse , who was no less jealous than the rest because she was jealous for her daughter , addressed the dancer : come here , little girl
it seemed to her , however , that she was going down a slope
that ’ s medicine—a formula against the bite of rabid dogs
mâtho , shattered by the disaster , had not so far thought of any way of retrieving it
the wine is better at the pomme d ’ ève
what have you done with her ?
in it were clothes which some charitable women had left for her at the entrance to the church
he cried , and brand them on the forehead with hot irons as cowards !
the streets were too narrow for the elephants
i don ’ t know why , but i was thinking of the bogey-monk that the goat had put me in mind of , and anyhow the lovely young girl ’ s get-up was a bit weird
the sun was about to come up
there are capitals interwoven with monks and nuns shamelessly coupling , as in the hall of chimneys of the palais de justice in paris
at last they suddenly charged , and the melee began again
the word for getting rid of fleas !
monsieur the duke of burgundy was a great noble , and he despised such rabble
each year , giddenem , the household must have children born !
and why did he take the ladder ?
i truly love you so much that it ’ s a miracle
and further on , at the porte-aux-peintres , there were some other people in sumptuous clothes
he asked a young man who was coming out
in number , the year of the coronation of our king louis xi , whom god preserve , paquette was so gay and pretty that she was known everywhere just as la chantefleurie
but schahabarim , because of his mutilation , could not take part in the worship of baal
he tried , however , to do as he was asked
there is one i specially hate , and whom i have cursed , she went on ; she ’ s a young one
it does you no harm , does it , if i come and look at you sleeping ?
a few moments later he came back , bringing a package that he cast at her feet
he has a hold on our entire body , and you hold us only by the chin
and with his head between her breasts he wept copiously
the mercenaries , whose baggage had been lost , hardly had enough for two days ; and all the others found themselves very short – for they were expecting a convoy promised by the villages of the south
an immense mass of shadow lay spread out before them , containing vague crests that looked like the gigantic waves of a petrified black ocean
it was as though the poor wretch was greeting the arrival of a saviour
but the suffete ’ s operations were incomprehensible
in a quarter of an hour
this cabalistic sun seems to tremble as one looks and fills the pale cell with its mysterious rays
leave it to me !
that will be better
he went up into the olive trees , and leaned out with his hand shading his eyes
when charmolue had installed himself magisterially in his , he sat down , then stood up again and said , without betraying too much vanity at his success : the accused has admitted everything
and from the back of the room filled with white steam where torches cast spots of red three barbarians were pushed in : a samnite , a spartan , and a cappadocian
whence raphael , michelangelo , jean goujon , palestrina , those glories of the dazzling sixteenth century
you are ruining your master !
now the auditor was deaf—a slight defect in an auditor
high barriers , made of planks studded with nails , stopped them ; a fourth gave way easily ; they rushed over it headlong , and rolled into a ditch where traps had been hidden
loose me , in heaven ’ s name !
be wary of travelling !
under louis xi one could in places see sticking out amid this sea of houses a few groups of ruined towers from the ancient enclosures like the tips of hills from a flood , like archipelagos of old paris submerged beneath the new
in any case , the chamber as a whole gave a general impression of neglect and decay ; and the poor state of the utensils led one to suppose that its master had for quite some time been distracted from his work by other concerns
the piety of those days , little given to reasoning and none too subtle , could not see so many facets in a religious act
you are right—it ’ s me they are attacking
it went down behind the lagoon , slowly , then suddenly disappeared in the mountains , where the barbarians were
they were quite capable of telling judas he would become pope
his long wings dipped their ends into the flame ; the unguents with which he had been rubbed flowed like sweat over his bronze limbs
from the top of the acropolis could be seen long trains of smoke rising up from the countryside into the sky ; it was the manors of the rich that were burning
the past must be reread on those marble pages
he had been appointed tetrarch at the capture of drepanum
now , as luck would have it , the master hosier from ghent , with whom the people already felt such sympathy and on whom all eyes were fixed , came to sit down in the front row of the tribune , precisely above the beggar ; they were not a little amazed to see the flemish ambassador inspect the rascal perched beneath him and then give him a friendly tap on his ragged shoulder
as you wax and wane , so cats ’ eyes and panthers ’ spots expand and shrink
mothers made a great to-do over their children once the gypsy women had read in their hands all manner of miracles written in heathen or turkish
first he went along the eastern face of the acropolis , then passed by the herb-market , the kinisdo arcades , the perfumers ’ quarters
she should have let them pull out her nails rather than extract such words from her
the priest was not listening to him
the rogue was sitting on a table , with legs crossed , finger raised , loudly imparting his knowledge of magic , white and black , to many of those standing around him with mouths agape
the lines had no rhyme , and were such as a deaf man might make up :
the hot-headed archdeacon did not let him finish : and i have studied medicine , astrology , and hermetics
i am a deserter from carthage
you will never see your houses again !
she was dancing , turning , whirling on an old persian carpet , thrown down carelessly beneath her feet ; and each time her radiant face passed before you as she spun round her great , dark eyes flashed lightning
this good bourgeois king preferred the bastille with a little bedroom and a little bed
the gypsy girl ’ s bodice slipped through his hands like an eelskin
but a loud noise of tambourines resounded on the horizon
we ’ ll have a field , a house , i ’ ll have you sleep in my bed
in the middle of the day three barbarians , dressed in animal skins , crossed their path
guillaume rym left to himself could have evaded the difficulty , but coppenole had heard the cardinal
the enterprise is impossible , said mâtho
but as his illness gave him a great appetite , there were also large amounts of food and wine , brine , meat , honeyed fish , and little jars from commagene , melted goose fat covered with snow and chopped straw
in any case , we ’ ll go down , and i ’ ll explain it to you from the text
in the wretched man ’ s tone there was so profound a sense of his wretchedness that she did not have the strength to say a single word
the other barbarians hurried to their help
a moment later she stirred , and they saw her drag herself on knees and elbows to the corner where the little shoe lay
an ashen glint dimly lit up this scene , and the gibbet stood out more and more distinctly in the square
the moment the figure realized that la esmeralda had seen it , it blew out the lamp
the girl said , finally finding enough strength to speak in her emotion , the gypsy woman did tell me
i have always seen her alone before !
the spies whom they caught disabused them
the commander made a grimace of disappointment
there ’ s also a phoebus , comte de foix
the sun was rising ; the moon herald put his hand in front of his eyes ; then grasping his trumpet firmly he blew a great brazen call over carthage
you have beaten me !
gloomy thoughts filled his mind
… fair cousin , he exclaimed , to change the subject , what ’ s all that noise in the parvis ?
the tavern , bright with countless candles , blazed from afar like a forge in the shadows
there were no more students , ambassadors , burghers , men , women ; no more clopin trouillefou , gilles lecornu , marie quatre-livres , robin poussepain
a dancer marrying an officer !
he was barely able to scramble on to a donkey ; he took flight , clutching on to the animal ’ s hair , crying , weeping , shaken about , battered , calling down on the army the curse of all the gods
doubled in four years !
it was the great helepolis , surrounded by a crowd of soldiers
then the tall bronze mass , nine storeys high , containing and occupying more than three thousand soldiers , began to sway gently like a ship
in a moment the ladder was set up , resting on the balustrade of the lower gallery , above one of the side doorways
but men with sphinx-like headdresses , armed with big staves , rushed into the crowd , hitting out right and left
during the early medieval period , while theocracy was organizing europe , while the vatican was rallying and regarding around itself the elements of a rome made from the rome lying in ruins around the capitol , while christianity was busy searching through the debris of the earlier civilization for all the stages of society and rebuilding from the ruins a new hierarchical universe with the priesthood as its keystone ; first you can hear welling up amid the chaos , then see rising bit by bit under the inspiration of christianity , under the hand of barbarians , from the rubble of the dead architecture , greek and roman , that mysterious romanesque architecture , sister to the theocratic masonries of egypt and india , unalterable emblem of pure catholicism , immutable hieroglyph of papal unity
claude , you are the spider
the court of miracles was in fact just a tavern , but a thieves ’ tavern , as red with blood as with wine
he had just retired after the office to his canonical cell in the cloister of notre-dame
that would be most strange , she murmured
muttered the young captain , twirling his moustache
i wager that those who are listening can hear him better than you—good !
this individual , we repeat , tall , lean , pallid , fair-haired , still young , though already showing wrinkles on his forehead and cheeks , with bright eyes and a smile on his lips , dressed in black serge , worn shiny with age , came up to the marble table and made a sign to the poor victim
she disappeared faster than a streak of lightning
when they had been fattened up and rubbed with benjamin , they would be put on ships and sent to balearic ports
a grotesque tiara had been put on his head , of hippopotamus hide , encrusted with pebbles
it was not the sort of look that gringoire had been fearing , ashamed as he was of having been caught unawares in this clownish costume by a grave and learned person
all the people were looking and listening
here and there you can see opening out on the ramps around it the dark caves of science , which intersect in its bowels
asked the archdeacon , who had gradually calmed down during this account
besides , he could already feel himself stretched out on his cross
the wall was stone , the roofing lead , the framework timber—that prodigious framework , so dense and complex that it was called the forest ’
hamilcar , of his own accord , went to find hanno ; and , in accordance with his plenary powers , handed over command to him
and narr ’ havas was hurrying out when salammbo appeared
to defend tunis there were the autochthonous population , , mercenaries , and all the unclean-eaters , for like mâtho they were riveted to the horizon of carthage , and the common people and the schalischim gazed from afar at the high walls , dreaming of the countless pleasures behind
he saw the other casements in the square light up one after the other ; he saw their lights go out too , down to the last one
the judge , increasingly angry , thought that he ought to continue in the same tone , hoping thus to strike such terror into the accused that it would react on the public and instil some respect in them once more
he saw jehan go to a window at the back of the room , open it , look out on to the quay where hundreds of lighted casements shone in the distance , and heard him say as he closed the window again : upon my soul !
but when the child is lost , these countless images of joy , delight , tenderness crowding round the little shoe become so many objects of horror
he heard the sound of a bolt
he went round the ramparts more than a score of times , looking for some breach through which to enter
all right , clopin , go and find a ladder !
he changed their arrangements
then , putting a foot into his hands , and another on his head , he reached up to the air vent , pushed into it and disappeared
the poor bell-ringer seemed to have disappeared from the church
saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie was wholly an opposition church
that building is colossal
the republic owed him four horses , twenty-three measures of wheat and a winter ’ s pay
all in all the philosopher put up very patiently with this sort of platonic marriage
it means being brother and sister , two souls touching but not merging , two fingers of the same hand
the captain continued , at the same time gently unbuckling the gypsy ’ s belt
he was in fact never seen again , and no one knew what had become of him
you belong to me !
go and find among the slaves a male child , eight or nine years old , with black hair and curving forehead !
round her neck she wore little square gold plaques representing a woman between two rearing lions ; and her whole costume represented the goddess ’ s attire
said one of the troopers
he ’ s stingy with men of merit
what do you want , djali ?
devil take it , said joannes de molendino , what are they chanting there , down at the end ?
my friend , and he turned towards the blind man , i sold my last shirt last week ; that is , since you only understand cicero ’ s language : vendidi hebdomada nuper transita meam ultimam chemisam
then , turning to the poet : what does it mean , phoebus ?
my brother is off his head , jehan said to himself , it would have been much simpler to write fatum
then the corpses were placed in the arms of the pataeci gods lined round the temple of khamon
these words , uttered with severity , brought back the insolent look to the resentful features of maître olivier
notre-dame de paris does not have , like the abbey of tournus , the solemn , massive build , the broad , circular vaulting , the chilly bareness , the majestic simplicity of buildings whose generating principle is the round arch
utica and hippo-zarytus refused an alliance
what have you done !
then from its base a huge ram came out ; along the sides towards the town the doors fell open , and inside appeared , like iron columns , armoured soldiers
it was the presentiment that in changing its form human thought was going to change its mode of expression , that the most important idea of each generation would no longer be written in the same material and in the same way , that the book of stone , so solid and durable , would give way to the book of paper , even more solid and durable
spendius was not far away ; he offered to explain them
give her back to me for a day , an hour , a minute , one minute , lord !
spendius and mâtho went over it
tradesmen chat and call out to each other from the doorway of their shops
the rest of the body was concealed by the sheepskins which filled the litter
we certainly owe that to the good holy virgin
it was laid down that every candidate , man or woman ( for a female pope might be chosen ) should preserve the impression of their grimace unspoiled and intact by covering their faces and staying out of sight in the chapel until it was time for them to make their appearance
a wretched cage where they only turn peasants
she looked round the room distraught
they both kept silence
what is it now ?
heedless of the country ’ s needs they cried out in wild despair when the servants of the hundred came with scissors to lay hands on them
several were still groaning ; they finished them off by sticking a heel in their mouths , or stabbing them with the point of a spear
maître philippe lheulier , advocate extraordinary to the king
but only the priest of tanit had stayed in his place ; and all hamilcar could see from a distance was his tall cap
the wind billowed out their veils , and the slim papyrus stems swayed gently
the torturer and the doctor came up to her together
but what is so awesome about this : glossa in epistolas d pauli
behind the infinite variety of their names ( which changed several times in the course of the centuries ) they could be reduced to two systems ; one group acted as slings and the other as bows
rumble grève , bay grève !
i must look like some sort of animal to you , don ’ t i ? —you are a ray of sunshine , a drop of dew , the song of a bird ! —while i am something dreadful , neither man nor beast , something harder , more downtrodden , more misshapen than a pebble !
in front could be seen a man crowned with ostrich feathers , galloping with a lance in each hand
his mouth was wide open , and from it emerged a cry that no one could hear , not that it was lost in the general clamour , intense though that was , but because it had surely gone to the limit of high-pitched audible sounds , the twelve thousand vibrations of sauveur or the eight thousand of biot
take it away , he said , do you think i care ?
at that an immense cry went up ; cymbals and crotals played louder , tambourines thundered , and the great purple canopy went in between the two pillars
spendius was not listening
he ’ ll stay two hours in the pillory
extraordinary reactions stirred within him
no , said the archdeacon , seizing compère tourangeau by the arm , a flash of enthusiasm rekindling in his dull eyes , no , i do not deny science
ice enclosed underground for a thousand years turns into rock crystal ; lead is the ancestor of all metals ( for gold is not a metal , gold is light ) —it takes lead only four periods , each of two hundred years , to pass successively from the state of lead to that of red arsenic , from red arsenic to tin , from tin to silver
very good , maître pierre , but how does it come about that you are now in the company of that dancer from egypt ?
in the centre the île de la cité , looking like a huge tortoise in shape and thrusting out its bridges , scaled with tiles , like paws from beneath its grey carapace of roofs
i ’ ll wager my head against a slipper that you will have opened that door , taken the girl and stripped the high altar before even one of the beadles has woken up !
why didn ’ t you kill him ?
at this the young gossips , becoming excited at the memory of the legate ’ s entry , both began talking at once
his people might be a collection of fools , cripples , thieves , and beggars , no matter !
the gypsy smothered her with kisses
but there were not enough ships , and day broke with nothing decided
then , while guillaume rym , a wise and crafty man ’ as philippe de commines puts it , followed both of them with a mocking and superior smile , they each went to their place , the cardinal quite put out and pensive , coppenole calm and haughty , reflecting no doubt that after all his title of hosier was as good as any other , and mary of burgundy , mother of the marguerite whom coppenole was marrying off that day , would have feared him less as a cardinal than as a hosier : for no cardinal would have stirred up the people of ghent against the favourites of charles the bold ’ s daughter ; no cardinal would have steeled the crowd with a word against her tears and entreaties when the lady of flanders came to the very foot of the scaffold to beg her people for mercy on their behalf ; while the hosier had only to lift his leather elbow to make both your heads roll , my most illustrious lords guy d ’ hymbercourt and chancellor guillaume hugonet !
master , there ’ s the moon coming out again—i only hope no one spots us !
the king remained silent for a moment , looking thoughtful , but pleased
ever since he had known the gypsy to be still alive , the chilling thoughts of spectre and tomb which had obsessed him for one whole day had vanished , and the flesh came back to goad him
he went up one of the lateral flights of steps leading to the altar , and walked on to the altar itself !
paying her fourpence : quattuor denarios
that phantom , that he-goat , that all smells of magic , said one of gringoire ’ s neighbours
in the middle of the tent , on a mat where the captains went to sit down , was a dish of steaming gourds
it was the paving of the gallery running along the cisterns
i stop work , go out of my hosier ’ s shop into the street , and shout pillage !
in fact the barbarians had no sooner come down than men , crouching behind the rocks , had tipped them over , using beams of wood as levers ; and as it was a steep slope , these enormous blocks , rolling headlong , had completely blocked the narrow opening
perhaps we are wrong to permit him to do so
i lose her , and that lasts fifteen years , then i find her again and that lasts one minute !
a waste of time
don ’ t you have your income from the gaol and palace bailiwicks , and the rent from all the houses , stalls , huts , and booths within the walls ?
already a considerable army encroached upon it , by occupying the base of the isthmus , and soon it would perish of hunger , for they could not survive without help from the provinces , since , unlike rome , the citizens paid no taxes
there ’ s the little goat with golden hooves !
they have cut into the living flesh , attacked the bone-structure of the art underneath , they have hewn , hacked , dislocated , killed the building , in its form as in its symbolism , in its logic as in its beauty
to be accepted into argot you ’ ve got to prove that you are some use , and to do that you ’ ll have to search the dummy
they had taken refuge on top of the hill
so saying , the desolate gringoire kissed the king ’ s slippers , and guillaume rym whispered to coppenole : he does well to crawl on the ground
it was like the weight of mountains on my days ; and yet something drew me on !
a papal bull granted them that right
day , which was only just breaking , still left plenty of dark corners in the rat-hole
do you know what friendship is ?
but what ’ s to be done , messire ?
one felt there the abiding presence of a spirit of noise and caprice singing out through all those bronze mouths
at the edge of her roof she could see the tops of countless chimneys from which rose , as she watched , the smoke from all the fires in paris
later on the republic will be grateful to you for such understanding
when the last passers-by had gone home , when all the windows in the other houses had gone dark , quasimodo remained alone , all by himself in total darkness
and louis xi looked almost as delighted as the hosier
dead coals go with cold ash
they went to settle down further away , all determined to lay siege to carthage
how bitterly he saw the piecemeal collapse of his whole edifice of fame and poetry !
when they came out of the gardens they found their way blocked by the wall enclosing megara
guillaume rym was the only one to notice his eminence put to flight
all that could be seen from below were high walls going up endlessly , like the sides of a monstrous tomb
the man spying on them from the shadows had also recognized them , apparently , for he slowly followed all the zigzags which the student imposed on the captain , who as a more seasoned drinker had kept a perfectly cool head
why should i obey you then ?
a few moments later the door of the retreat opened and then closed again on the five individuals whom the reader saw there at the beginning of this chapter , and who had now gone back to their places , their subdued conversations , and their attitudes
mâtho ordered wooden towers built to be as high as those of stone
she has a good memory , observed fleur-de-lys
do you persist in your denial ?
bright fires burned under hanging pots ; and the crimson reflection of their flames lit up certain places and left others completely in darkness
he was hardly in one place before he was moving on to the next
what a tiresome mood you ’ re both in !
but we have few people around us tonight—it will be time enough tomorrow morning
its fine skin , covered like the firmament with golden spots on a black background , was yellow now , flabby , wrinkled , and too big for its body ; mildew extended like fluff round its head ; and in the corner of its eyelids could be seen little red spots which seemed to move
he began by declaring that if it were a question of their courage they were worthy of them
some of them thought they were at the baths , because of the mist floating around them , or , noticing the foliage , imagined they were out hunting and ran upon their companions as though they were wild beasts
almost all were without a face or an arm ; some still appeared intact ; others were completely dried up and powdery skulls filled their helmets ; fleshless feet stuck straight out of the cnemides , skeletons kept on their cloaks ; bones , cleaned by the sun , made gleaming patches in the middle of the sand
maître pierre , it simply has to be done
a tall man went down into the water
over there is the abbey of saint-martin , singing sharp and cracked ; here the gruff , sinister voice of the bastille ; at the other end the great tower of the louvre , with its bass-baritone
no he hasn ’ t , said jehan judiciously
have them flayed alive !
till tomorrow , repeated gringoire
they ran to it
it ’ s a really bold countermine , and it will solve the problem for all of us
salammbo noticed , and pressed the amulet she wore upon her heart
not much—i have so many things—goodness , what a pretty little goat that was !
their chests heaved with great rasping breaths , and their eyes stared out from their long hair which hung down as though it had been in a bath of purple
he had divided his soldiers by even numbers , being careful to put alternately along the ranks a strong man and a weak , so that the less vigorous or more cowardly should be both led and pushed by two others
what could i do ?
you no longer have to defend you the strong men of former days , who went beyond the oceans to build temples by the shore
over to the east the morning breeze chased across the sky a few white shreds of cottonwool torn from the hazy fleece covering the hills
i tell you , clopin went on in a rage , that i ’ m not a jew , and i ’ ll have you hanged , by the synagogue ’ s belly !
a profound silence fell on the assembly , with some laughter , though muffled so that they could listen to all the ludicrous names and civic titles that each individual transmitted imperturbably to the usher , who then tossed names and titles in any order and much mangled down to the crowd
she interrupted him with a smile and a look full of the utmost sweetness : oh !
a second blow completed the collapse of the old iron crossbar which blocked the window
he was almost trembling for fear that she might want him
the girl submitted to it all , repeating at intervals , very softly and with infinite gentleness : mother !
i ’ ll let you know when you can come near
the only piece of furniture suitable for sleeping on was a fairly long wooden chest , though it had a carved lid , as a result of which when gringoire stretched out on it he felt somewhat like micromegas lying down full length across the alps
he wore black felt boots , sprinkled with silver moons
it is not very much—let us return to the real great hall of the real old palais
when mâtho arrived the moon was coming up behind her
and the cripple took up the musical phrase as he repeated : un pedaso de pan !
a hot wind blew
tristan l ’ hermite in his corner had the disgruntled expression of a mastiff which has seen but not had
a fourth small boy , squatting in the mud , was almost lost in a cauldron which he was scraping with a tile , producing a sound to make stradivarius swoon
the archdeacon silently contemplated the gigantic building for a while , then sighed as he stretched out his right hand towards the printed book lying open on his table and his left hand towards notre-dame , and looked sadly from the book to the church
said fleur-de-lys , the poor creature !
after a silence , louis xi again spoke up
remarkably enough , all the crowd , which had been in such an uproar a few minutes before , was now quite docile as it waited , trusting in the actor ’ s word , which goes to prove the eternal truth , still a matter of daily experience in our modern theatres , that the best way to get the public to wait patiently is to assure them that the play is about to begin at once
but how did she come to be by him , in his tent , at his mercy ?
meanwhile the good mother , delighted to see the betrothed pair getting on so admirably together , had just left the apartment to attend to some domestic detail
le mur murant paris rend paris murmurant
what does my mother matter ?
a woman hurled a stone at his head : that ’ ll teach you to wake us up at night with your damned ringing !
the suffete ’ s soldiers had by chance been unable to discover them , and as he had withdrawn from the battlefield , they were still in their deep pit
the attorney turned round aghast
i have just had a very narrow escape !
the man beckoned to gringoire and his companion to get into it
if all he needs for that is my curse , then i freely give it to him , his cathedral , and his mills !
my wife , according to what i was told by an old ruffian whom our people call the duke of egypt , my wife is a foundling , or a stray , which comes to the same thing
they had nothing to fear ; any change of fortune meant an end to their troubles
they had not expected such clemency ; spendius cried :
he was somewhat reassured by the fact that the condemned girl did not take her eyes off the floor of the tumbril
guillaume rym thought he should intervene : maître coppenole , you are talking to a mighty king
it was no doubt his sister
gringoire sighed , heartbroken , bassa latinitas [ alas !
or if you do not want to , i will stay
in the centre of the eastern side of the place rose a heavy , heterogeneous construction consisting of three houses in juxtaposition
they hastily took the little clubfoot away
but when some houses had caught fire the remaining dead and dying had been quickly thrown over the walls ; zarxas had kept to the reeds at the edge of the lake until the following day ; then he had wandered round the countryside , trying to find the army from footprints in the dust
the person who entered wore a black robe and a gloomy expression
she was free , she was dead
that ’ s true , by god
in the syssitia buildings there were twelve hundred nubile slaves , some of those intended for prostitution in greece and italy , and their hair , made springy by the use of unguents , was wonderful for war machines
and from the very first moments , without anyone thinking of watching him , he had firmly secured to one of the colonnets of the gallery a stout knotted rope , its end trailing down on the steps below
hamilcar , not making it a point of pride to keep the battlefield for himself , had withdrawn a little further , to the left , on to heights from where he could dominate them
, pointing to the suffete ’ s guards , motionless in their gleaming armour
the great painted stars had stopped turning ; the tabernacles had been set on the ground ; and smoke from the censers rose straight up , like gigantic trees spreading out their blue branches amid the azure
she could hear no sound , detect no sign of human movement save from the cité , in uproar and glowing red , separated from her only by an arm of the seine , and from whence her own name reached her mixed with cries of death
it ’ s a brand new morality , never been used before
huge trunks of hippopotamus hide carried , at their corners , whole rows of smaller sacks ; heaps of bullion lay in mounds on the floor ; and here and there a pile had grown too high and had collapsed , to look like a ruined column
compère jacques , you should know
it ’ s me , look at me
they hurried in pursuit
the poor deaf creature whispered , fancy refusing that !
monsieur le docteur coictier , i was delighted to learn that your nephew , my reverend lord pierre versé , had been appointed to a bishopric
when next day the mercenaries resumed their task , the top of the walls was completely padded with bales of cotton , cloth , cushions ; the battlements were closed with mats ; and on the rampart between the cranes could be made out a row of pitchforks and cleavers stuck on to poles
hamilcar had made them extravagant promises , vague , to be sure , but solemn and repeated
a moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder so violently that she sat up fully awake and furious
and what grievance do they have against the bailiff ?
margaritas ante porcos [ pearls before swine ]
however , this cry , which frightened the gypsy girl , delighted a band of children who were prowling about
the three women retraced their steps , and when they were near the house of the tour-roland , oudarde said to the other two : we mustn ’ t all look into the hole at the same time in case we frighten the sachette
you are tiring yourself out with praying too long !
come on , he added , where ’ s henriet cousin ?
he was one of the temple servants , a man schahabarim used for dangerous missions
this time , on the contrary , she sat up as if with a start and listened eagerly
he ground his teeth and raised his great hand against spendius
as soon as he recognized hamilcar he rushed towards him , crying :
i beg your majesty … ’
she knew nothing of obscene effigies , since with each god manifesting itself in different forms , cults that were often contradictory bore witness simultaneously to the same principle , and salammbo worshipped the goddess in her astral image
; sometimes a word devoid of any obvious sense : άναγνοϕαγία , perhaps concealing some bitter allusion to the regime of the cloister ; sometimes a simple maxim of clerical discipline formulated as a regular hexameter : cœlestium dominum , terrestrem dicito domnum [ call the lord of heaven dominus ’ , of earth domnus ’ ]
o florian , you oaf !
he was witty , subtle , full of ideas and words ; the barbarians grew used to his services ; he won their affections
he had his eyes fixed on the tumbril
he leaped at one of the camels of the baggage train , tore off its halter ; with the long rope he flogged the stragglers : and ran to right and left , alternately , at the rear of the army , like a dog driving a flock of sheep
they blocked their ears to the shooting , closed their shutters , barricaded their doors , let the dispute be settled with or without the watch , and next day people in paris would tell each other : last night they broke into etienne barbette ’ s house
it was formed of two walls and packed with earth ; the upper parts were knocked down
it is certain that if the soul had not yet left this inert , somnolent , lethargic body , it had at least withdrawn to hide in depths to which the perceptions of external organs no longer penetrated
my poor room with blood all over it , the captain stretched out full length with a dagger in his neck , the girl acting dead , and the goat quite terrified
but the more schahabarim felt himself doubting tanit , the more he wanted to believe in her
he needed some coastal base , so that he could bring in from the islands or cyrene provisions and soldiers , and he coveted the port of utica as being closest to carthage
finally , far off to the east , vincennes and its seven quadrangular towers ; to the south , bicêtre and its pointed turrets ; to the north saint-denis and its slim spire ; to the west saint-cloud and its keep
on two lower seats were her father and her bridegroom
he said , grinding his teeth
he was more than a brother to the child , he became a mother to it
he had been waiting for a quarter of an hour ; he felt as though he had aged by a hundred years
the rain beat on the terraces and overflowed , forming lakes in the courtyards , cascades down the steps , whirlpools at street corners
look , here it is !
the negresses ’ heads made large black spots in the line of gold plated fillets which clasped the brows of the roman women
suddenly , as she struggled , crawling on the floor , the gypsy ’ s hand touched something cold and metallic
the archdeacon spoke with authority
the small chapel facing the marble table was chosen as the scene for the face-pulling
then lying flat on him he slowly pulled out the entrails with the end of his teeth
ladders were put out for them ; they all rushed to them
in order to penetrate the deepest mysteries of her dogma , she wanted to know the old idol in the most secret recesses of the temple with its magnificent cloak on which depended the destiny of carthage – for the idea of a god did not clearly emerge from its representation , and to hold or even see its image was to remove a part of its strength and , in some way , to dominate it
but their anger with the suffete had not abated ; they shouted parting threats at him , and hamilcar replied :
it still seems as if it happened yesterday !
he ’ s yelling loud enough to deafen a cantor , continued gauchère
people were expressing annoyance , still quietly , it is true
the latter were the most violent
went on a jewish-looking marcandier
it was indeed the rector and all the university dignitaries going in procession to meet the embassy , and at that moment crossing the place du palais
he opened his cassock
the wretched woman began to laugh her wild laugh
the gypsy girl made no reply
you will be so happy !
for earrings she had two little sapphire scales holding a hollow pearl filled with liquid perfume
now there would be the frightening sight of a bizarre dwarf on top of one of the towers , climbing , wriggling , crawling on all fours , coming down the outside over the abyss , leaping from projection to projection , delving into the belly of some sculptured gorgon ; it was quasimodo dislodging crows
at last the members of the grand council made up their minds
they were in agony
they were a troop of slingers who had come in the previous day , and who , on that day , had overslept
indeed , said phoebus , as though looking for some accommodation with himself , to encounter a sword or a girl are both delightful assignations ; but i don ’ t see why i should give up one for the other when i can have both
he let her go : degrade me , hit me , be vicious !
at once the earth shook – and the barbarians saw charging , in a single line , all the elephants of carthage with their tusks gilded , their ears painted blue , armoured in bronze , and with leather towers shaking about on top of their scarlet caparisons , with three archers in each holding great open bows
finally , no longer knowing what to do or what would become of me , i denounced you to the official
a pack of beggars , who have become good friends of mine , taught me twenty kinds of herculean tricks , and now every evening i give my teeth the bread they have earned during the day by the sweat of my brow
the priest , upright , angry , menacing , imperious : quasimodo prostrate , humble , suppliant
said the whole crowd with one voice
it gave on to a narrow passage
with each step she took forward , he took one back , and that was all
gringoire stammered , i haven ’ t got so much as a denier parisis
at the same time the little goat put itself in front of her , and confronted gringoire in battle order , bristling with two pretty , gilded , and very sharp horns
then the porters , the sutlers , the slaves began to murmur , and no one , neither the people nor the grand council , sent even a hope
behind the bastille a score of poor cottages huddled round the curious sculptures of the croix-faubin and the flying buttresses of the abbey of saint-antoine-des-champs ; then came popincourt , lost among the cornfields ; then la courtille , a merry village full of taverns ; the bourg saint-laurent , with its church , the steeple from a distance looking like an addition to the pointed towers of the porte saint-martin ; the faubourg saint-denis , with the vast enclosure of saint-ladre ; outside the porte montmartre , the grange-batelière girdled with white walls ; behind , with its chalky slopes , montmartre , which at that time had as many churches as windmills , but has kept only the windmills , for all that society now demands is bread for the body
my name is pierre gringoire , and i am the poet whose morality play was performed this morning in the great hall of the palais
the men , the architects , the artists of our own day
gisco was dismissing them , but i did not want the interpreters to be able to speak
next morning she realized when she woke up that she had been asleep
then , suspended over the abyss , launched on the fearsome swinging of the bell , he seized the bronze monster by its lugs , gripped it with both knees , spurred it on with both heels and added the whole shock and weight of his body to increase the frenzy of the peal
and he fell back into his chair in an attitude of one powerful and inspired
then hamilcar went extraordinarily pale , and those who were leaning outside over the pit saw him put a hand against the wall to prevent himself from falling
you can ’ t escape now , even if you had the pope ’ s bowels to digest with
he was too ugly
the girl seemed to be taking no notice of him ; she came and went , moved a stool , talked to her goat , pouted now and then
what i say , master , is that they won ’ t hang me maybe , but will hang me indubitably
i like such plain speaking
i sent for oxen from hecatompylus , i sent out hunters into the desert !
here the louis xiii churches , heavy , squat , surbased , stocky , weighed down with a dome like a hump
no doubt this strange beacon would awaken in the distance the woodman of the bicêtre hills , terrified at seeing the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre-dame wavering over his heath
they gulped down all the greek wines that come in wineskins , campanian wines kept in amphorae , cantabrian wines brought over in casks , as well as wines of cinnamon , jujube , and lotus
he added : besides , we are old friends
i have to say men of the art ’ since there have been individuals in the past two centuries who have assumed the title of architect
unable to get rid of it , hearing your song always ringing in my heart , seeing your feet always dancing over my breviary , feeling always in my dreams at night the smooth touch of your shape upon my flesh , i tried to see you again , to touch you , to find out who you were , to see if i would find you anything like the ideal image of you which had remained with me , perhaps to break my dream with the reality
she seized it with a convulsion of hope , put it to her lips and blew with all her remaining strength
stones from the catapults and demolitions ordered for defence purposes had piled a heap of ruins in the middle of the streets
at that moment the curtain of the dressing room described earlier parted , and through it came an individual whose mere appearance stopped the crowd and as if by magic changed its anger into curiosity
as the priest drew nearer this smile became clearer , more distinct , more radiant
as for flight , what way was there ?
where ’ s the benefit for me ?
it was indeed a quite marvellous grimace that was just then beaming through the hole in the rose-window
you freed me from the prison
the elephants halted ; they swung their massive heads , loaded with ostrich feathers , and beat their trunks against their shoulders
i give you simon radin ’ s office
though his conscience rebelled he committed appalling deeds , imagining that he was obeying a god ’ s voice
he witnessed countless little scenes between the gypsy and the deaf man , whose pantomime , seen from a distance and commented on by his own passion , seemed most affectionate
she turned her head with the sharp , abrupt movement of a steel spring , her two long , skinny hands came up to push the hair back from her forehead , and she looked at the boy in bitter , hopeless amazement
she looked up at the magistrate with her large , staring eyes , and answered like a machine , without tension or tremor : yes
that is what he called coming to a tragic end ’
kyrie eleison , repeated the crowd in a murmur running over their heads like water lapping in a choppy sea
her face was covered by a white scarf wound over her mouth and forehead , so that only her eyes could be seen ; but her lips shone through the transparent material like the jewels at her fingers – for salammbo kept both hands wrapped up , and all the time they were speaking she did not make a gesture
such was the pope whom the fools had just given themselves
to be a poet and have as much success as an apothecary !
her slave slowly raised her up , for according to the rites someone had to come and tear the suppliant from her prostration ; that meant that the gods approved , and salammbo ’ s nurse never failed in this pious duty
this all happened so fast that had it been night time , everything could have been seen by the light of a single flash of lightning
that was infallibly what was going to happen
[ when the coloured birds are silent and the earth … ] ’
they stopped yards from the camp to pull out from the sheaths on their saddle-bows their round shields , broad swords and boeotian helmets
he frothed and twisted , like some marine monster being butchered on the shore , predicting that their end would be still more horrible and that he would be avenged
the student finally reached the balcony of the gallery , and swung over very nimbly to the applause of all the truandery
that is the charming turret which occupies the northern corner of the place and which , already buried beneath the ignoble coats of distemper which clog the bold lines of its carvings , will perhaps soon have disappeared , submerged by the rising flood of new buildings so rapidly swallowing up all the old façades of paris
come , said charmolue , carry her on to the cart and let ’ s get this finished !
he resolved to devote himself entirely to a future , for which he would answer before god , and never to have any other spouse , any other child than the happiness and prosperity of his brother
without constraint , with all your heart , with the intention of carrying out your promises ?
they added that people had met him one evening of the previous month , in the middle of the mappalia , led by an old man
she met monsieur le curé of saint-rémy and told him : monsieur le curé , i ’ ll plough the earth with my fingernails , but give me back my child ! —it was heart-rending , oudarde ; and i saw one very hard man , maître ponce lacabre , the prosecutor , weeping
what a tiresome , disagreeable hussy , said one old judge , having them apply the question to her when we have not yet had supper !
that same night quasimodo was not asleep
as she entered this room she was struck with horror
the rope is a death like any other , or , to be more precise , it is not like any other death
they did not know how to answer so much talking
the gypsy girl had suffered so much that all that now remained was astonishment
fortunately someone came to rescue him and assume responsibility
it was for him one of those moments of selfish , exclusive , supreme delight when the artist sees in the world only art and sees the world in art
so he was running away ; and sailing northwards , he disappeared into the haze
that ’ s all you know about her ?
then from the compartments round the wall he took two purple squares , put one on the boy ’ s chest , the other on his back , and joined them at the collarbone with two diamond clasps
envious of what , monsieur the archdeacon ?
he swept the horizon with a haughty look as if to say all that is now mine !
a warm , heavy fog , such as comes in these regions at the end of winter , fell upon the army on the fourteenth day
he cried in despair
claude frollo was no longer the simple student of the collège de torchi , loving protector of a little child , the dreamy young philosopher who knew a lot of things and was ignorant of many more
salammbo , used to eunuchs , was lost in wonder at this man ’ s power
and it ’ s now that she is beautiful , grown up , talking to me , loving me , it ’ s now they come to devour her , before my eyes , i , her mother !
exclaimed maître jehan as he came out of his hole , the two screech-owls have gone
she asked in a changed voice
the dog and his master
then , standing up on his barrel : nobody wants him ?
to the right of the tournelles , that enormous bundle of inky-black towers , running one into another , and lashed together , so to speak , by a circular moat , that keep with far more loopholes than windows , that drawbridge kept always raised , that portcullis always lowered , that is the bastille
she said , the man ’ s drunk
this figure , which looked as though it were fixed to the floor , seemed to be without movement , thought or breath
next day she took advantage of a moment when the child was asleep on her bed , for she always put it to sleep with her , very quietly left the door ajar , and hurried to tell one of the neighbours in the rue de la séchesserie that the day would come when her daughter agnès would be served at table by the king of england and the archduke of ethiopia , and lots of other surprising things
there ’ s always some broken cask lying around
go back to carthage !
swear to carry out all my orders , to follow me like a shadow !
giddenem soon came back , presenting a young boy
you ’ ve never seen anything more amorous than her eyes , more rounded than her legs , more noble than her attitude , better draped than her skirt
for the moment it is a stock exchange
a proper leech pulled off a barrel
unless it was built on piles , like notre-dame , a palace , a fortress , a church , always had a double bottom
he seemed to make it a point of honour to swallow it
beauty only loves beauty ,
we have absolutely no idea
you saw at once two long , parallel streets , running without a break , without disturbance , almost in a straight line , crossing each of the townships from end to end , from south to north , at right angles to the seine , connecting and mingling , then , constantly infusing , pouring , and decanting the people from one into the walls of another , and making the three into one
as they recognized several of the proper names which had caught their ear , the mercenaries were convinced that he was giving an exact account of the suffete ’ s speech
they were full of anxiety
one could just make out by the beams of a little light a sort of hut , shaped like a beehive , where the ferryman sheltered at night
their hands were hidden in their sleeves , their feet beneath their gowns , their eyes beneath their caps
how did he manage to be here , the old gambler ?
at last they made out a large black snake
i looked for you
meanwhile our philosopher reflected
then the soldiers ’ delegates and those of the grand council were reconciled , swearing by the genius of carthage and the gods of the barbarians
i ’ ll just tell them you escaped , that i let you go
he was now irrevocably lost
whoever can that be , standing beside the trestle with his black smock and pale face ?
surrounded by his sons , giving orders to his happy slaves , counting on the wall how many necklets of honour his country has given him ?
then he said to her aloud : girl , have you asked god ’ s forgiveness for your faults and failings ?
the story of the cake
cries rose up ; a fearful glare blazed behind the canvas
the gypsy was not indifferent to these pinpricks
they stretched out their arms over the chains , crying that he had been allowed too wide a path ; and he went , probed , pricked , ripped by all these fingers ; when he reached the end of one street , another appeared , several times he hurled himself sideways to bite them , they quickly drew away , the chains held him back , and the crowd burst out laughing
where are you going then , tybalde ad dados [ thibaut the dice ] , turning your back on the university and trotting off towards the town ?
phoebus replied , it ’ s all the same to me
we parisians are generally mistaken in thinking how much ground we have acquired since then
he was a sombre and imposing person , before whom trembled the choirboys in their alb and gown , the machicots , the brethren of saint augustine , the early morning clergy of notre-dame , as he slowly passed beneath the high arches of the choir , majestic , pensive , with his arms folded and his head bent so low on his chest that all that could be seen of his face was his great bald forehead
it is hard to convey any idea of the degree of proud and blissful satisfaction which the hideous , mournful features of quasimodo had come to express in the course of the journey from the palais to the grève
on the furnace were heaped in disorder all kinds of vessels , stone flasks , glass retorts , charcoal matrasses
the barbarians made haste to catch up with the velites ; right at the back , among some galloping oxen , other carthaginians were running in disorder
so their battlefront , if we may be permitted the expression , changed immediately , without a single word being spoken between them
the captain stood up to oblige her , scolding her with a self-satisfied smile
the poor devil , assuming that the provost was asking his name , broke his customary silence and answered in a hoarse , guttural voice : quasimodo
last month , would you believe it , he caught an eagle by surprise ; it dragged him along , and the blood of the bird and that of the boy were sprinkled in great drops through the air , like roses blowing away
our children , you see , are the very marrow of our bones—my poor eustache !
curfew had sounded an hour before , night had fallen , and there was only a flickering wax candle on the table to provide light for five individuals variously grouped around the room
moreover , it may be added , the captain had been thinking for the past few moments of the deep darkness of the night , of the supernatural ugliness , the sepulchral tones of the strange messenger , that it was past midnight , that the street was as deserted as it had been that evening when the bogey-monk had accosted him , and that his horse snorted when it looked at quasimodo
their golden bracelets leaped up and down amid the floating folds of their cloaks
which proves a new truth : great events have incalculable consequences
we say rue coupe-gorge
but in a short time all these attempts at communal legislation fell into disuse
i sampled them all , one after another
everyone was trying to point them out to his neighbour , put a name to them , be acquainted with at least one of them ; for one it was the lord bishop of marseilles , alaudet , if memory serves aright ; another the dean of saint-denis ; another , robert de lespinasse , abbot of saint-germain-des-prés , libertine brother of one of louis xi ’ s mistresses : all this with numerous errors and cacophony
for fitting six panes of white glass at the hôtel des tournelles in the place where the iron cage is—number sols
it was the only speech he could still hear , the only sound which disturbed his universal silence
he often had the assault sounded , and without waiting rushed on to the mole that they were trying to construct in the sea
now the ruling feature , the characteristic and distinctive aspect of the primate of the gauls ’ character was his courtier ’ s instinct and his devotion to those in power
about the time the sun was going down he examined himself afresh , and found that he was almost mad
sometimes a doorway , a façade , a whole church offers a symbolic meaning absolutely alien to worship , or even hostile to the church
all night long they saw fires burning on the horizon , in the direction of carthage ; these flares , like giant torches , lengthened out over the still lake
salammbo undid her ear pendants , her necklace , her bracelets , her long white gown ; she unfastened the band round her hair , and for a few minutes shook it over her shoulders , gently , to refresh herself by loosening it
the pitcher broke into four pieces
two esquires , corpus christi !
quasimodo , who could not hear , saw the naked swords , the torches , the pikeheads , all this cavalry , at whose head he recognized captain phoebus ; he saw the truands , thrown into confusion , the terror of some , the agitation of the best of them , and this unhoped-for aid so revived his strength that he hurled off the church the first attackers who were already stepping over the gallery
the priest ’ s eyes were fixed , haggard , blazing , and remained riveted to the horrible little group of the fly and the spider
she stood there aghast and stupefied
the guards of the legion galloped at random ; people went up on to houses , terraces , the shoulders of colossi and into the masts of ships
muttered phoebus , here ’ s a nasty , scruffy customer i seem to have seen somewhere before !
he continued , musing and as though talking to himself : very nice
she is sitting on wheatsheaves , and has a handsome garland round her head of ears of corn interwoven with salsify and other flowers
a cloud of grey dust drifted down
the captain had repeated that phrase so many times , in so many similar situations that he declaimed it all in one breath , with flawless accuracy
there were already several candles burning here and there on the tables , casting their beams over the heads of clerks slumped over piles of paper
one has got to stay alive , and the finest alexandrines don ’ t appease hunger like a piece of brie cheese
brothers gazed at each other with both hands clasped , lover bade lover an eternal farewell , standing weeping on his shoulder
they were lined up along the rampart , beating tambourines , plucking lyres , shaking castanets , and the rays of the sun setting behind them in the mountains of numidia struck through the strings of the harps , on which their bare arms stretched out
when would you like me to have that little enchantress picked up ?
that force of sex and blood in the grown man which , as a foolish youth i thought i had stifled for life , had more than once convulsively shaken the iron chain of vows binding me , poor wretch , to the cold stones of the altar
there was , however , a certain air of gentleness about that face , but the gentleness of a cat or a judge , an affected gentleness
it ’ s the recluse from the tour-roland , they shouted , laughing wildly , it ’ s the sachette grumbling !
the condemned girl held up in her teeth the shift which had not been properly fastened
when she withdrew her head from the window her face streamed with tears
mâtho went round the terrace , hugging the walls
opposite the tall cathedral stained red by the setting sun , on the stone balcony built over the porch of a handsome gothic mansion , standing on the corner of the place and the rue du parvis , some lovely young girls were laughing and chatting in the most delightful and light-hearted manner
they shouted , leaped up , and the most cheerful began telling stories ; the bad times were over
some resentment , however , still smouldered in the captain ’ s heart : too bad if the devil ’ s muck-cart picks you up as it goes by !
maître jacques charmolue paraded at their head
i don ’ t really know … a trifle , a horse , a remark !
who stupidly fixed that heavy stone anachronism into hercandus ’ carolingian pavement ?
let your anger go like a runaway chariot , said spendius
however soldiers were needed and there was not a government which trusted the republic
he went on , never taking his eyes off the window
looking at the gypsy
we shall do likewise
her lyre dropped , she fell silent – and pressing both hands to her heart , she stayed for some moments with her eyes closed , savouring the excitement of all these men
if i wanted … ’
feed what should be hanged !
behind rose the forest of slender spires of the tournelles palace
one of these towers had been converted by the truands into a place of entertainment
as he passed by the door of the ringing chamber , which stood ajar , he saw something that struck him ; he saw quasimodo , leaning at an opening of those slate louvres which look like huge venetian blinds , also looking down on to the square
spendius would have spat upon the images of olympian jupiter ; yet he was afraid to speak loudly in the dark , and never failed every day to put his right shoe on first
it was like a snake following her
coictier calmed down , muttering under his breath : after all , he ’ s mad
it wended its way for some while through the inside of the sombre keep , riddled with stairways and corridors running even in the thickness of the walls
over by the kitchens , amid ragged clothes and shorn hair , men blew up the embers with fans , and a smell of burning flesh rose up
the reader can take his choice ; for our part we should be inclined to believe quite simply that he was in a bad temper because he was in a bad temper
but the marine suffete , a priestly magistrate under the sun ’ s protection , was inviolable , so long as the assembly of the rich had not judged him
she looked up at him in astonishment
she ’ s in the rue de glatigny
these men , accustomed to war , found it boring to stay in a town : they were easily convinced , and the people went up on the walls to see them go away
a broad , deep moat , fast-flowing during the winter floods , washed the foot of the walls all round paris ; the seine provided the water
the greek tore from his hands a roll of papyrus filled with phoenician writing
with it she rubbed her ears , heels , her right thumb , and her nail indeed stayed slightly red , as if she had squashed a fruit
you are behaving like the rhinoceros who tramples in its own excrement : you are displaying your stupidity !
she will call , her slaves will run up and , for all your strength , you will die !
a second blow followed the first , then a third , and another , continously
each night his delirious imagination depicted la esmeralda to him in all the attitudes which had most set fire coursing through his veins
he stayed like that for over an hour without stirring , his eye fixed on the deserted cell , more gloomy and pensive than a mother sitting between an empty cradle and a full coffin
the town , the largest of the three portions of paris , had the right bank
the suffete meanwhile had breached the outer walls and got as far as the citadel
this was the bed , famous for having borne louis xi sleeping or sleepless , on which one could still gaze two hundred years ago in the home of a state counsellor , where it was seen by madame pilou , celebrated in cyrus under the name of arricidie ’ and living morality
shouted tristan , who had just posted his troops in a circle round the rat-hole , and was waiting on horseback beside the gibbet
said the former slave ; and raising his arm , he showed him the brilliant planet chabar
i ’ ve lost it , said gringoire
they were astonished at her attire ; but she looked round slowly at all of them , in horror , then with deeply bowed head and outstretched arms , she repeated several times :
the cell was still empty
it was the moment of half-light
by our lady , i ’ m not philippe brille , and i ’ m not going to regild the great vassals
all had risen to their feet
his face , flat as a mastiff ’ s , was topped by a net of bark fibre ; he wore a leopard-skin belt with all its hair on and two formidable cutlasses glinting in it
hanno contented himself with blocking the port without risking an attack
on the face of this old queen of our cathedrals , beside each wrinkle you will find a scar
the living tripod saluted him as he went by , but by raising his hat no higher than gringoire ’ s chin , like a shaving-dish , and crying in his ear : señor caballero , para comprar un pedaso de pan !
on the wall facing the barbarians , they brought up tree trunks , millstones , jars full of sulphur , tubs full of oil , and built furnaces
who could doubt it ?
at that moment of anguish he noticed , a little lower than the balustrade from whence he had been crushing the argoteers , two long stone rainspouts which discharged immediately above the main door
his broad feet seemed to stand as solidly on the pavement of the church as the heavy romanesque pillars
their fine white gorgets , their red-and-white striped tiretaine skirts , their white knitted stockings , with coloured embroidery at the ankles , pulled trimly over the leg , their square shoes of fawn leather with black soles , and especially their headdress , a sort of tinsel horn loaded with ribbons and lace , such as women still wear in champagne , in common with the grenadiers of the russian imperial guard , proclaimed that they belonged to that class of rich tradespeople which comes midway between what servants call a woman ’ and what they call a lady ’
take monsieur de châteaupers with you
explain yourself on all these points—clerk , have you written down what the accused has said so far ?
it was at megara , a suburb of carthage , in hamilcar ’ s gardens
they had lit great bright fires which both dazzled them and left the punic army beneath them in shadow
to the right , an agglomeration of white houses rose beyond a circle of walls ; then the sea stretched out , without end ; chin in hand , the barbarians sighed as they dreamed of their homelands
suddenly small stones rolled down from above
barbarians whom i once commanded chained me up by the arms and legs , like some murderous slave
he came up to gringoire , who seemed to be sunk in profound reverie , his feet up on a firedog
yes , claude , dear colleague , but that damned manor at poligny that they talk about isn ’ t worth number gold écus to me , taking one year with another
he reminded the mercenaries of the grand council ’ s promises ; the africans , of the intendants ’ cruelties ; all the barbarians of the injustice of carthage
poor jupiter , gaunt , aghast , pale under his rouge , dropped his thunderbolt , took his helmet in his hand ; then bowing and trembling he stammered : his eminence … the ambassadors … madame marguerite of flanders … ’
i suppose i am the victim of some holocaust she has promised the gods ? … she holds me fast by some invisible chain
because with us when a woman gives a soldier a drink , said the gaul , she is offering him her bed
this detonation woke up the peaceful occupants of the houses round about , several windows could be seen opening , and nightcaps and hands holding candles appeared at the casements
the archdeacon ’ s pale face blushed as red as a young girl ’ s cheek
he had frail limbs , a slanting skull , a pointed chin ; his skin looked cold to the touch , and his hollow face , furrowed by deep wrinkles , looked as if it was contracted in some eternal longing , some grief
the pointed arch , dominant from then on , constructed the rest of the church
phoebus , then , quickly put his mind at rest concerning the enchantress esmeralda , or similar , as he called her , the stabbing by the gypsy or the bogey-monk ( it mattered little to him which ) , and the outcome of the trial
his stomach overflowed on to the scarlet jacket that covered his thighs : the folds of his neck fell down to his chest like an ox ’ s dewlaps , his tunic , painted with flowers , was split at the armpits ; he wore a scarf , a belt , and a full black cloak with double laced sleeves
the spectacle is indeed a curious one , well worthy of the spectators ’ attention
one morning she found a birdcage on her window
the gates were closed
she said , mechanically repeating the words whose impression was fresh in her ear ; then , making an effort to turn her attention to the sense of those words : ah !
the unfortunate esmeralda dropped her head beneath her hair , realizing that she was not dealing with a human being
first , the great fiery star , a foot wide and a cubit high , which fell , as everyone knows , from the sky on to the palais , after midnight on number march
come now , maître pierre
in number it reached number , number livres—i have the figures in my head—in number number , number livres ; and this year , by the faith of my body !
as she considered him she was absorbed by a host of vague thoughts
the open door banged in the wind
finally on the thirteenth day of the month of schabar – at daybreak – a great crash was heard against the gate of khamon
the loveliest black eyes !
there was a light in one of the ground-floor windows
he was not laughing any more , he was terrible , pacing up and down , a fox turned into a hyena , he seemed to be so choked that he could not speak , his lips moved , and his bony fists clenched
for several days now he had been on his guard
innocent and venerable infancy of art and stage machinery !
but the care of his body did not interrupt his concern for the welfare of the state , and he was dictating a letter to the grand council and , as some prisoners had just been taken , wondering what terrible punishment to invent
the duke of egypt sadly pointed out to him the two streams of boiling lead which continuously streaked down the black façade , like two long distaffs charged with phosphorus
when quasimodo , who had never for a moment stopped fighting , saw this rout , he fell to his knees and raised his hands to heaven ; then , drunk with joy , he ran , he went up as swiftly as a bird to the cell whose approaches he had so dauntlessly defended
and he added a few vague words about the public problems which he hoped to resolve alone
it meant that one power would succeed another
from the position of the sun above the moon he concluded the predominance of baal , of whom the luminary is only the figure and reflection ; besides , all that he saw of earthly things forced him to acknowledge the male exterminating principle as supreme
it is as though it was conscious of the presence of the heavy romanesque pillars nearby
then—how can one check the hellish slide ? —then i was no longer my own master
then he retreated , head bowed , but the last to go , like a general who has fought well
when the student saw himself disarmed , stripped , weak , and naked in those redoubtable hands , he did not try to speak to the deaf man , but began laughing insolently in his face and singing in the carefree , dauntless way of a lad of number , the currently popular song :
it was a long session
gringoire heroically endured this new encounter
the slave lit the perfumes
from the cloister his reputation for learning had reached the people , where it had become slightly distorted , as frequently happened at the time , into renown as a sorcerer
come now , monsieur the archdeacon , no ill feeling between old friends !
two gentlemen among these rascals !
moloch ’ s servants were astonished that the great hamilcar was so tender hearted
isabeau , my dear , i shan ’ t be pleased with jupiter until he changes your two white tits into two black bottles , from which i can suck beaune wine day and night
then , from the time of the first line of kings , paris , too constricted on the island , no longer with room enough to turn round , crossed the water
these were the rich , held captive since the beginning of the war
it was obvious that the girl was referring to his feeble support in the critical situation in which she had been two hours earlier
the officer did not come out
in the time of architecture it became a mountain and took forceful possession of an age and a space
did your husband tell you about the accident , mademoiselle la boudraque ?
spoken like a man , mathias , said the king of tunis
but , reverend master , it ’ s not enough to spend your life , you ’ ve got to earn it
in front of each of them rose two columns , with the horns of ammon on their capitals , making a continuous range of porticoes all round the basin
this setting sun is what we take for a new dawn
now , in number , quasimodo had grown up
all the girls looked up
but he was not primitive enough to live for three hundred years , more ’ s the pity !
these are all real marvels
mâtho had said to himself that if he could pass between the walls and narr ’ havas ’ tents quickly enough for the numidians to have no time to come out , he would fall on the rear of the carthaginian infantry , which would be caught between his division and those of the inside
meanwhile maître florian , the auditor , attentively leafed through the dossier of the charges brought against quasimodo , which the clerk handed him , and once he had glanced at it , seemed to be reflecting for a moment
let him have his say , monsieur rym , my friend , said the king
there ’ s someone wants a word with you
this name phoebus ’ reached the archdeacon ’ s ear just as he was explaining to the king ’ s attorney the dragon hiding its tail in a bath from whence smoke and a king ’ s head emerge
i ’ ll take him , she said
husson le voir even played the flute there
he felt as though iron pincers had gripped his arm
on the south side of this square leaned the wrinkled , scowling façade of the hôtel-dieu , its roof covered seemingly with boils and warts
in his innermost heart remorse held him back
and he passed on
on her return , hearing no crying as she went up the stairs , she said to herself : good !
five or six men from the provostry armed themselves with picks and crowbars , and tristan made his way with them to the window
they are expensive animals , said louis xi
the abbot of saint-germain-des-prés had battlements like a baron , and spent more on bronze for bombards than for bells
carthage was full of joy – deep , universal , boundless , frenetic joy ; the holes in the ruins had been filled in , the gods ’ statues repainted , branches of myrtle were strewn over the streets , incense smoked at crossroads , and the crowd on the terraces with its multi-coloured clothes looked like heaps of flowers opening out in the air
if i had , the archdeacon replied , pronouncing the words slowly , like a man reflecting , the king of france would be called claude and not louis
and to the scorpions : pierce them to the heart !
suddenly she felt the stranger ’ s hand upon her own
is there anyone there to see that i ’ ve got my daughter ?
my lodgings are in the rue jean-pain-mollet , in vico johannis-pain-mollet—you are cornier than a unicorn if you say otherwise
clopin trouillefou was chewing his huge fists with rage
everyone is not obliged to know greek
– spendius took the lamp to light his way
the men came next , and tortured them from the feet , which they cut off at the ankles , to the brow , from which they took circlets of skin to wear on their heads
it had been dug only to put off robbers , and hid nothing
a hundred yards further on they saw two more , then there suddenly appeared a whole line of crosses with lions hanging on them
i ’ ll take care of placating monsieur the bailiff , and he ’ ll placate the cardinal
you will find my answer written on the wall
she added after a silence : it ’ s a holiday , people forget me
only the king appeared not to have heard it
the archdeacon went on after a silence : so she saved your life ?
they read your hand and told you the most amazing prophecies
that side of the seine was , for the rest , the less commercial of the two ; noise and crowds came from the students rather than the artisans , and the quay , strictly speaking , ran only from the pont saint-michel to the tour de nesle
it was the only profane link to combine with this pious chain of monastic establishments
salammbo went forward to the edge of the terrace
this rare creature seemed to extend even over the court of miracles the sovereign power of her charm and beauty
the crowd occupied the steps of the acropolis
women understand and respond to each other ’ s instincts more swiftly than men to each other ’ s intellects
this incident , this last proof , produced a great effect
there could be no doubt about it , there he was , handsome , alive , dressed in his dazzling uniform , plume on head , sword at side !
spendius , with the money from his dromedary , had bought a slave
it was very high , in solid oak , with iron nails and lined with bronze
human justice called that forgetting ’
thus , in number , the inhabitants were ordered at nightfall to light candles in their windows and keep their dogs shut in , under pain of the halter ; the same year , came the order to close streets every evening with iron chains , and a prohibition on carrying daggers or offensive weapons at night in the streets
they ’ ve been playing dice
they were too weak to bring down the crows flying above by throwing stones at them
she went on slowly , staring fixedly at her daughter
leaving aside here the less important peculiarities of old paris , and the caprices of right of way , we may say in general , taking only the overall pattern and major features in the chaos of communal jurisdiction , that the island belonged to the bishop , the right bank to the provost of merchants , the left bank to the rector of the university
only one tent remained
the captain , emboldened by her docility , put his arm round her waist without meeting any resistance , then began very quietly unlacing the poor child ’ s bodice , and disarranged her gorget to such an extent that the priest , breathing heavily , saw the gypsy ’ s bare shoulder emerge from the gauze , round and brown , like the moon rising on a misty horizon
spendius , autharitus , and zarxas , four italiots , a negro , and two spartans offered themselves as spokesmen
first of all don ’ t talk to me about your phoebus
with a veil over his face , brandishing torches , he had cast a black cock on a fire of sandarac , before the sphinx ’ s breast , the father of terror
such was the vengeance of carthaginian peasants when they caught a wild beast ; they hoped to terrify the others by such examples
the king of tunis frowned
exclaimed the poor unhappy child , at the same time clinging to the captain and making him sit beside her
and they would have hanged it too , wouldn ’ t they ?
on top of the acropolis , the dungeon door , cut into the rock at the foot of the temple , had just opened ; and in this black hole a man stood at the entrance
of the kingdom of argot
meanwhile maître philippe lheulier , advocate extraordinary to the king , intervened again : may i remind you , messieurs , that in the deposition taken down at his bedside , the murdered officer , while declaring that the thought had vaguely occurred to him at the moment when the man in black accosted him that he might very well be the bogey-monk , added that the phantom had keenly pressed him to enter upon familiar relations with the accused , and on his observing , i mean the captain , that he had no money , had given him the écu with which the said officer had paid la falourdel
and i ’ ve no money left !
from time to time a river came into sight with the green of tamarisks , only to disappear as it went round the hills
in former times this cell had been constructed almost on top of the tower , among the crows ’ nests , by bishop hugo of besançon , number who had practised the black arts there in his time
it was like a hurricane whirling round him
they wielded cutlasses split into several branches like antelopes ’ antlers , pruning hooks fastened to the end of a rope , iron triangles , clubs , punches
spendius beckoned to him , and led him to a fold in the ground where zarxas and autharitus were hiding
others had silver arrows in their hair , emerald butterflies , or long needles fanning out in the sun
quia nominor leo [ because i am called lion ]
with the tip of his boot he pushed a carpet under his head
let ’ s try once more , went on the truand ,
their tears provide its moisture ; it is a dark place full of mud , ruins , and storms
i have it from my husband , who is a cinquantenier at the parloir-aux-bourgeois , and this morning he was comparing the flemish ambassadors with the ones from prester john and the emperor of trebizond who came from mesopotamia to paris in our late king ’ s time , and wore rings in their ears
the pointed steeple of saint-sulpice marked one of the corners of the bourg
the barbarians jostled each other and shouted
the sky was low and cloudy
it was an obsession
of the twin sounds that a church makes , the organ within , the bells without , only the organ was left
i hope so , she said
she was alone in the south tower with her sister jacqueline , a smaller bell , enclosed in a smaller cage beside her
there are only a few , but it is a superior kind of audience , an educated audience
this gigantic man , master of the zaïmph , dominated the rabbetna as much as baal did and appeared to her surrounded by the same lightning flashes ; then the gods ’ souls , sometimes , visited men ’ s bodies
bowing his head with its assyrian mitre , he looked at the gold plate on his breast covered with fateful stones , to which the reflection of the flames imparted irridescent gleams
he thought of how the meadows smelled on autumn mornings , of snowflakes , of how the aurochs lowed when they were lost in the mist , and closing his eyes , he imagined he could see the fires of the long , straw-roofed huts , flickering over the marshes , in the depths of the woods
the compère answered in the same low tones , with a bitter smile
however , under so many different names , they were still only two streets , but two parent streets , the two generators and arteries of paris
the archdeacon put in
ropes of pearls fastened to her temples fell to the corners of her mouth , rose red like a half-open pomegranate
the president bent over to a man at his feet , wearing a gold cap and a black robe , a chain round his neck , and a staff in his hand
he had clung to it , embodied himself in it , identified himself with it
cried salammbo , i shall see her , shan ’ t i ?
but gringoire only tried harder and cried still more loudly : start again !
at the cardinal ’ s entrance it seemed as though a magic , invisible thread had suddenly drawn every eye from the marble table to the tribune , from the southern end of the hall to its western side
very well , comrades , cried out the marcandier , on to notre-dame !
no character so unexpected , no twist of plot , no dramatic suspense but had to climb this ladder
in the middle he put the etruscans , all linked together with a bronze chain ; the archers were behind , and on the two wings he distributed the naffur , mounted on shaven camels , covered with ostrich feathers
and a salvo from crossbows and arquebuses was fired at the front of the church
put it all together as best you may
they shook it , it gave , and they found themselves on the steps of a staircase
do you know , phoebus , that reminds me of my young days , the entry of king charles vii , when there was such a crowd too—i don ’ t recall the year any more
mâtho meanwhile was besieging hippo-zarytus
master , just now the carthaginians are sure of their victory
yes , i do , madame
the city , which occupied the island of that name , was the oldest , the smallest , and mother of the other two , squeezed between them , if we may be allowed the comparison , like a little old woman between her two tall beautiful daughters
i am suffering too much , my poor child ! —it is something worthy of compassion , i assure you
a stone was set upright , and that was a letter , and each letter was a hieroglyph , and each hieroglyph carried a group of ideas like the capital on a column
she was down to the last sou of her gold piece
but then he would be between the two armies , a piece of imprudence he could not commit with scanty forces
the poor cicada stopped dead
they ran , calling to each other to welcome the elders
one more day like this and the war would be over !
with one blow he split mâtho ’ s chest , then tore out his heart , put it on the spoon , and schahabarim , raising his arm , offered it to the sun
it made him swell out like a bird in the sunshine
we have tried everything we ’ ve got , as the old comedian plautus has it :
as for those who went to buy chalcedony along the road of syrtes and the temple of ammon , they had doubtless perished in the sand
very well , follow me
but beneath that thought , no doubt the first and simplest one , there was in our view another , newer one , less easily perceived and more easily challenged , a view just as philosophical , no longer that of the priest alone , but of the scholar and the artist
such criminal acts were quite extraordinary
the rainspout above which he had been leaning broke his fall
at any rate , that is the opinion of maître nicolas and the hermetics…
protesting his devotion to the gods , he heaped curses upon the carthaginians
has it got to be dragged out of you with forceps ?
the little rascals were just as scared of you as you were of them
in most cases the neighbours became involved only if looting actually reached their doorstep
the devil take you , said gringoire , and me with you , if i know what you mean !
jehan frollo and robert poussepain were laughing up their sleeves
then one of the lions began to walk , silhouetted with his monstrous shape as a black shadow against the background of the crimson sky ; when he was close to the man he knocked him down with a single blow of his paw
he decided to risk it , but not without first addressing a fervent prayer to the dummy which he was about to rob and which would have been easier to soften up than the truands
the private retreat where monsieur louis of france says his hours
what more did she need , naïve and credulous as she was ?
now i am more than a man
the door fell back behind him
mothers cry your name in the pangs of childbirth !
but his efforts were in vain ; the thread of his memory and his thoughts was broken ; and doubting everything , drifting from what he saw to what he felt , he asked himself the insoluble question : if i am , does this exist ?
above her cell was a sculpture which frightened her
the soldiers whom he had commanded in sicily were treating themselves to a great feast to celebrate the anniversary of the battle of eryx , and as their master was away and there were a large number of them , they ate and drank in complete freedom
when he saw these men , he made the captains a sign to move back , then leaned forward to examine them
widen it , tristan said angrily
with her terrible laugh growing even louder she cried : what does your king matter to me ?
monsieur , phoebus answered in some embarrassment , many thanks for your courtesy
you have either got to wed a truand woman or the rope
as he passed the trading house , he took a basket of grapes and a jar of pure water ; the child woke up before the statue of aletes , in the jewel vault ; and he smiled – like the other one – on his father ’ s arm at the blaze of brilliance around him
but in her shame , her wantonness , and her abandonment , it seemed to her that she could be less shameful , less wanton , less abandoned if there was something or someone in the world whom she could love and who could love her
someone cried : how much did they pay you to defend them ?
they could be seen from afar taking fat from the dead to oil their machines , and others tore the nails off corpses , and sewed them together end to end as breastplates
a memory that he could not identify went through his mind
the extreme in crime brings delirious joy
in front of the central portal it stopped
he pushed him away with a caress
the slaves were about to hurl themselves on him
let her have time to see the sun !
at the very most he would watch anxiously when dom claude went up the tower staircase , but the archdeacon had of his own accord refrained from appearing again before the gypsy ’ s eyes
being stunned , petrified , as though asphyxiated by the immeasurable tirades continually erupting from every part of his epithalamium
the little open-work rose-window pierced over the doorway was in particular a masterpiece of lightness and grace ; it looked like a star woven from lace
holy father , you are the most beautifully ugly thing i ’ ve ever seen in my life
what , sir , she went on , you ’ ve eaten it all up ?
sometimes a viper passed , eagles flew over ; the slave kept running ; salammbo dreamed beneath her veils , and despite the heat did not discard them for fear of soiling her fine clothes
the noble damsel herself was more charming than ever
if eustache had been shrewder , that is less greedy , he would have waited longer , and only when they were back home in the university , at maître andry musnier ’ s house in the rue madame-la-valence , with the two arms of the seine and the five bridges of the city between the rat-hole and the cake , would he have ventured to ask timidly : mother , now may i eat the cake ?
going to bed with no supper is tiresome enough ; it is even less fun to go without supper and no prospect of a bed for the night
it was from people in khamon ’ s square crying out for arms
wondered gringoire , looking at what she was looking at : it can ’ t be that grinning dwarf carved on the keystone that ’ s absorbing all her attention
i have long been hesitating ; i am devoured by curiosity about her shape
by worshipping aptouknos , god of the libyans , he was afraid of offending moloch ; and he asked spendius
it was on this bedstead that foundlings were customarily exposed to public charity
down with the rector , the electors and the proctors !
one of them , bouncing amid the debris of the feast , jumped into the pool , and floated there for a while , with open mouth and staring eyes
next day , two leagues from reims , on a heath between gueux and tilloy , they found the remains of a big fire , some ribbons which had belonged to paquette ’ s child , some drops of blood , and some goat droppings
he realized it too late
i am only a poor girl … ’
i must buy some more ; no quills left , i must buy some more ; no paper , no books , i must buy some more
does your majesty believe that at the hour of death it is a great satisfaction for a king to have let no offence go unpunished ?
gringoire , ready with noble classical comparisons , mentally compared him with vulcan ’ s living tripod
he was the son of the lion of france
spendius leaned out over the terrace ; with teeth chattering he repeated :
at that name the accused stood up
the slave , trembling horribly , stammered :
i don ’ t know , the unhappy child replied , but i have been condemned to death
a fine of a hundred livres parisis to the king !
gringoire , seeing him sunk in thought , left him and went to admire the porch of a house nearby
add to that the pleasure of displaying as he rode about the town his fine fighting dress ( which you can still admire today carved on his tomb at the abbey of valmont in normandy ) , and his helmet , badly dented at montlhéry , all this contrasting with the half-red , half-tan robes of the échevins and quarteniers
she stared for a few minutes at this kind of spectre
he came forward with his arms crossed , and with such a terrible look that she was at once rooted to the floor
hamilcar barred their road to carthage ; they were caught between his soldiers and narr ’ havas ’ s provinces ; the tyrian towns would join the victors ; they were going to find themselves with their backs to the sea , and all these forces together would crush them
that is how people saw everything in those days , without metaphysics , without exaggeration , without a magnifying glass , with the naked eye
his pupils blazed like candles through the cracks in the door
independently of the original , individual contribution of each writer , there are collective shares
what ’ s making me so chilly ?
the other repeated , breathing rapidly
an old woman explained to maître coppenole that quasimodo was deaf
you are wearing your mother round your neck
the door was a great flat slab of stone , as in a tomb
she threw herself upon it , tried to hold it back , dug her nails into the stone , but the massive block , set moving by six men , escaped from her and slid gently to the ground along the iron bars
they called out in the darkness , and the army followed them at a distance
despite their redwood ornaments , the dirt on their black skin made them look like blackberries that have been rolling about in the dust
he looked at her anxiously as if trying to guess what she was saying
how many sages come fluttering from afar only to dash their heads against it !
for the rest , there was in the audience a merciless observer of his deeds and action in the person of our friend jehan frollo du moulin , the young student of the day before , that rambler whom one was always sure to meet anywhere in paris except in front of the professor ’ s chair
the girl ’ s light touch as she withdrew her foot from under him made him come round
she suddenly asked mahiette
tristan turned his head , and signalled to his troop to prepare to move off again
then , looking around him again as intently and anxiously as a fox returning stealthily to its earth : no matter !
the barbarians tried to put out their eyes , to cut their hamstrings ; others slid under their bellies , drove a sword in up to the hilt and were crushed to death ; the boldest clung to their harness ; under flame , shot and arrows they kept sawing at the leather , and the wicker tower collapsed like one built of stone
then came the masters of the finances , the provincial governors and all the rich
but the conviction of their helplessness soon plunged them back into the same gloom
yesterday you saw the flemings ; today you must see the gypsy girl
she said in a low voice , trembling with anger and terror
the church he found as dark and silent as a cave
my brave men from sicca !
when the prisoner was unshod ’ , the attorney in ecclesiastical courts examined her foot , still numb from the pain
imagine , then , crowning a mound of plaster , a huge parallelepiped of masonry , number feet high , number feet wide , number feet long , with a door , an outside ramp and a platform : on this platform stand sixteen enormous pillars of rough stone , number feet high , arranged in a colonnade round three of the four sides of the massive structure supporting them , connected at the top by stout beams from which chains hang at intervals ; on all these chains , skeletons ; nearby on the plain , a stone cross and two secondary gibbets , which seem to be growing like shoots around the central fork ; above it all , in the sky , crows perpetually circle
the cell was not , however , deserted
then came the realm of argot , thieves ’ cant ; that is to say , all the thieves of france , ranked in order of dignity , the lowest going first
gringoire was reverently examining its external sculptures
order prayers to be offered !
said the compère in surprise
he cried , running his sunken eyes over the register
the unfortunate prologue was cut short for the second time
chteaupers to the rescue !
nations , like the waves , roared around it , and the slightest storm rocked this formidable craft
she did not come ; this seemed to him a fresh betrayal – and henceforth he execrated her
they jumped into the crowd and never came back
la esmeralda stayed silent for a moment , then a tear fell from her eyes , a sigh from her lips , and she said : o my lord , i love you
then clopin , pointing to a rickety old stool placed beneath the dummy , told gringoire : get up there
in fourteen days he pacified the region between thouccaber and utica , with the towns of tignicabah , tessarah , vacca , and others away to the west
the cloud returned blacker than ever to quasimodo ’ s brow
the girl heard him weeping
we should say here that at that time a prince ’ s apartment consisted of no fewer than eleven rooms , from the audience room to the oratory , not to mention the galleries , baths , steam rooms , and other superfluous places ’ with which each apartment was provided ; not to mention the private gardens of each of the king ’ s guests ; not to mention kitchens , storerooms , pantries , general household refectories ; backyards , with twenty-two general workshops , from the bakehouse to the butlery ; games of innumerable kinds , mall , tennis , tilting at the ring ; aviaries , fishponds , menageries , stables , cattle-sheds ; libraries , arsenals , and foundries
they shut their eyes to avoid seeing them
they had all fought fiercely
yes , yes , all the others answered , it ’ s him , it ’ s him all right , maître thibaut , the rector
that is a sound i can hear
one evening when they were sitting opposite each other like this taanach arrived in great dismay
but salammbo was sobbing ; the slave cried :
greeks could be recognized by their slender figures , egyptians by their hunched shoulders , cantabrians by their sturdy calves
i agree , master , that it ’ s better to philosophize and poeticize , blow the flame in the furnace or receive it from heaven , than to carry cats in triumph
or it might be a band of students and soldiers playing hopscotch rising in a body and greeting them classically with some latin jeer : eia !
but how will we get into notre-dame ?
he was , as far as the dim lamplight enabled one to judge , an elderly man of some number years , of average height , looking rather ill and bent
he followed him all the same
this decadence is what is called renaissance
there the elders laid down their sticks of narwhal horn – for a law always observed imposed the death penalty on anyone coming to a meeting with a weapon of any kind
this is the end of the world then , murmured andry , stopping up his ears
in all their petitions to parliament , compère jacques went on , they claim that they have but two masters , your majesty and their god , who is , i believe , the devil
tambourines and cymbals were hung from top to bottom of their cedar columns
deportations , massacres , and epidemics did not weaken tunis
several people made a lot of money by hiring out bows
… by tomorrow evening … they ’ ll be only too pleased
and i mean the execution to be performed by you
i saw you undressed and handled half naked by the torturer ’ s infamous hands
it looked as if some other church had sent to the assault of notre-dame its gorgons , its mastiffs , its dragons , its demons , its most fantastic sculptures
the suffete had invited all the captives to serve in his troops
they were so happy in their work that they made jokes about the names of the machines
at last the high priest of moloch passed his left hand beneath the children ’ s veils , and tore from each head a lock of hair which he threw on the flames
masses of men pushed them , clinging to their bases ; with every step they shook and shuddered ; and so they arrived facing the walls
he cried out to be helped out of the bath
she tore the knife out of quasimodo ’ s hands , and burst out into furious laughter
la creatura bella bianco vestita ( dante ) [ the lovely creature robed in white ]
your pity is about as well placed as a feather in a pig ’ s arse !
by my grandmother ’ s warts , jehan , that ’ s pushing nonsense too far
this jacqueline was so called after the wife of jean de montagu , who had given it to the church , but that had not prevented him from appearing without his head at montfaucon
then , talking to himself : they will all perish !
the archdeacon had promptly resumed his original severity : i ’ ll send you some new boots
he lay down flat on his face ; he dug his nails into the ground and wept ; he felt wretched , miserable , abandoned
on such bright , warm , tranquil days there is a certain hour especially for admiring the portal of notre-dame
suddenly a hundred torches , which made the soldiers ’ helmets sparkle , spread over the church , at every height , on the towers , on the galleries , under the flying buttresses
his genius had never been so impetuous and fertile
meanwhile the slaves , with their tunics tucked up , went round on tiptoe ; from time to time the lyres played a hymn , or a chorus of voices rose
come , she said to him gently
he accused her of being the cause of the war
the news of the victory had reached there , inexplicably , already by the third hour of the night ; the clepsydra of khamon had poured out the fifth hour as they arrived at malqua ; then mâtho opened his eyes
then bursting into sobs : oh !
the girl sitting in front of him watched him in silence , obviously preoccupied with some other thought , at which she smiled from time to time , while her hand gently stroked the goat ’ s intelligent head , pressed softly between her knees
at last , weary of her thoughts , she got up , and dragging her small sandals , with the sole clapping against her heel at every step , she walked at random about the great silent room
at my whistle , he will follow ; and if i take ship he will run in the wake of my vessel over the foaming waves
mâtho muttered to himself
bronze scales covered the walls ; in the middle , on a granite pedestal , stood the statue of a cabirus called aletes , discoverer of mines in celtiberia
he came up beside the negroes who carried the torches
chameleons crawled over the broad cactus leaves
there ’ s no doubt that the bogey-monk , who was over by the temple last year , is now prowling about in the cité
the sort of living creature which lay on those boards that quasimodo morning in the year of our lord number seemed to be arousing intense curiosity among the very considerable group collected round the bed
that brought a glint to the priest ’ s sunken eyes
do you recognize me ?
you make me boil , gringoire
a nasty little page amusing himself spattering students by riding his horse through the mire !
the word , the accent , the sound of his voice made her shudder
one after another , my ewe lambs !
for such was provost tristan ’ s custom at executions
send help before morning !
the king knew that better than anyone
there was nothing lacking , not even the rope , which swung gracefully from the crossbar
i told him not to , he didn ’ t listen , so then i had a bite too , you see !
it was in fact a very fine piece of work , and in our view might well be turned to good account even today , subject to a few alterations
then he would go back into his tent , drink a mixture of barley and cumin until he fell in a drunken stupor – and then wake up in full sunlight , tormented by a horrible thirst
the nave was completely deserted
the tumbril had entered the parvis
what we are doing here
suddenly , above phoebus ’ head , she saw another head , a livid , green , convulsed face , with the eyes of a damned soul
often he saw clearly that she was growing weary trying to follow his thoughts
however , in this crowd over which the four allegories competed in pouring out streams of metaphor , no ear was more attentive , no heart palpitated with more emotion , no eye was more distraught , no neck more intently craned than the eye , ear , heart , and neck of the author , the poet , the good pierre gringoire , who a moment before had not been able to resist the pleasure of telling two pretty girls his name
i have not forgotten the insolence of your great calm eyes and how you crushed me with the loftiness of your beauty !
salammbo waited ; her horse , in fright , turned round snorting
so he kept to his bell tower , on the alert , musing in his musery ’ as rabelais has it , his eye alternately on the cell and on paris , keeping careful watch , like a faithful dog , his mind filled with mistrust
permanent anxiety troubled the colleges of pontiffs
every illusion had been dispelled
if only you knew how full the cellars were and how the ploughshares gleamed !
two hours later mâtho arrived
a grizzled old sergeant of the watch stepped forward and addressed the provost : mad , indeed , my lord !
from time to time they passed over high ground lit up by the moon ; then a star trembled at the tip of the pikes , the helmets glinted for a moment , everything disappeared , others came up , continually
ah , that ’ s different , answered liénarde
gringoire tried to take the sachet
that , said diane , is a terrible name for a young lady !
the captain ’ s body , drenched in his own blood , was being carried away , the priest had vanished , the window at the back of the room , looking on to the river , stood wide open , someone was picking up a cloak , supposing it to belong to the officer , and she heard them say around her : she ’ s a witch who has stabbed a captain
men ’ s existence , their very flesh , belonged to him ; thus , to save this existence , the carthaginians were accustomed to offer him a portion to still his fury
finally he took a dagger from his belt and put it at her throat
the spectacle provoked a special kind of giddy elation , it had a certain power of intoxication and fascination , of which it would be hard to convey any idea to a modern reader and modern drawing-room society
but at least we ’ d get a stay of execution
he took an interest in me , and it ’ s thanks to him that today i am a real scholar , knowing latin from cicero ’ s offices to the mortuology of the celestine fathers , and no barbarian in scholastics , poetics , rhythmics , or even hermetics , the wisdom of wisdoms
the stout furrier , without answering a word , strove to escape the eyes gazing at him from every side , but he sweated and puffed in vain ; like a wedge being driven into wood , the only result of his efforts was to clamp still more tightly between his neighbours ’ shoulders his great apoplectic face , purple with vexation and rage
poor woman , said oudarde , full of pity , would you like a bit of fire ?
fortunately for him , the moon had just come up in the last few moments
this catastrophe falling in the moment of their victory stupefied them
the movement seemed to be coming towards the cité
gringoire and everyone in the court of miracles were desperately worried
i swear it , fair angel !
do i love you , angel of my life !
the courses of dressed stone were all cracked at their joins , and grass grew on the platform where feet never trod
now , mahiette replied
long lines of barbarians were running down the mountain , and the punic squares were advancing against them in heavy , regular waves
pimp , slave , son of slave !
the heart of a handsome young man is often misshapen
i assure you , said charmolue , looking at him but not understanding , that i won ’ t touch it
so the écu is a coin from hell
i ’ m not surprised any more , added gervaise , that you are so obsessed with fear of gypsies !
there were ammonians , with limbs wrinkled by the water from the hot springs ; atarantes , who curse the sun ; troglodytes , who bury their dead with laughter beneath the branches of trees ; and the hideous auseans , who eat locusts , achyrmachides who eat lice , and gysantes , daubed with vermilion , who eat monkeys
she would certainly have struck
from the top of their stockade they hurled arrows , earth , dung , pebbles torn from the ground , while the six catapults constantly rolled the length of the terrace
why do we need such a prodigious household ?
you see before you , brother , a guilty man , a criminal , a wretch , a libertine , a heinous person !
at that moment he felt someone tug at the hem of his surcoat ; he turned round in some annoyance , and had some difficulty in smiling
for a much-needed moral lesson
said the king anxiously
they wanted to fight at once
they had fled like the slave , one despite his cruelty , the other despite his bravery
we shall come back , said spendius ; go in front
i am very ugly , aren ’ t i ?
where did the watch encounter the mob ?
then , in obvious embarrassment : listen , maître pierre gringoire
quando las pintadas aves
do not touch it !
i already have to make promises to him , and i only came to carthage to buy him a dagger with a silver handle surrounded by pearls
hamilcar passed by it ; then , bending down , he pushed a very heavy millstone back on its rollers and through the opening entered an apartment built in the shape of a cone
hamilcar was not jealous of hanno ’ s success
he seemed indirectly to have offended salammbo
flocks of sheep grazed among the stones ; a woman , with a blue fleece round her waist , was tending them
you need only to be handsome on the outside !
listen , master , i ’ m a man with imagination
some of them stood trembling and sobbing as if in a daze ; others called out to their friends to shoot at the barbarians
the first effect of this fatal organism was to disturb the way he looked at things
they are coming now to take me
they would have liked a kind of death in which the whole city could participate , in which every hand , every weapon , everything carthaginian , down to the paving stones and the waters of the gulf , could tear , crush , destroy him
bundles of lances piled up in the townships like sheaves of corn
they are determined rascals
my dear colombe , put in dame aloïse , don ’ t you mean the hôtel which used to belong to monsieur de bacqueville in charles vi ’ s time ?
she looked at him for a moment with pity , then dropped her eyes , made a pleat in her skirt and remained undecided
another man accompanied him , a sort of giant who went about bareheaded
as he had supposed , the gypsy was still in the same place
the said iron weighing in all number , number livres ; besides number large iron braces serving to fasten the said cage , with clamps and nails weighing together number livres of iron , not counting the iron lattice over the window of the room where the cage has been placed , the iron bolts of the door to the room , and various other items … ’
claude did not open
but his pride revived with the pain
now , if it was me , i wouldn ’ t say that , but her , a child of number !
there ’ s a chapel crowned by a little vault full of nicely carved decorations
the artist builds in his own way
once i saw they were intending to hang someone , i threw in my hand
suddenly she stood up , pushed her long grey hair away from her forehead and without saying a word began shaking the bars of her cell with both hands more furiously than a lioness
meanwhile , although the sun was not yet up , it was broad daylight , a fine rosy tint brightened up the rotten old chimneys of the maison-aux-piliers
how does maître jacques charmolue go … ?
my lordship of poissy hasn ’ t brought in anything this year
the carthaginians were halted by the river
but if you were driven on by your shameless frenzy you could at least have behaved like wild animals who do their coupling in secret , and not display your shame right under your father ’ s eyes !
that was claude frollo
these four points at which the seine cut the capital ’ s ring-wall , the tournelle and the tour de nesle on the left , the tour de billy and the tour du bois on the right , were called par excellence the four towers of paris ’
i followed you into the chamber of pain
in the dying rays of the sun the bronze plates covering it from top to bottom shone dazzling bright ; it seemed to the barbarians that they saw a trail of blood there
it was the little goat crying
that day it might have been july
they drank urine cooled in bronze helmets
from the tower where we are standing the hôtel saint-pol , almost half of it hidden by the four large residences we have just mentioned , was still a very considerable and wonderful sight
it no longer expressed anything , not even the memory of the art of former days
poor , yes ; unhappy , no
in the nineteenth century it will rebuild
tailors embroidered cloaks , others wove nets , combed cushions , cut out sandals , egyptian workers were polishing papyri with a seashell , the weavers ’ shuttle rattled , the armourers ’ anvils rang
you ’ ll hang it for me
give me nothing but salt and black bread if i may only have my daughter to warm me up like a sun !
he turned towards the door , then , with the utmost graciousness ( so well did he apply himself ) , when the usher resoundingly announced : messieurs the envoys of monsieur the duke of austria
are you willing to be one of us ?
at the moment when he arrived panting at the place du parvis he recoiled and did not dare look up at the fatal building
you have an interest in this girl , in my wife , i mean , that ’ s fine
in the middle of the hall , set up against the western wall , a large and magnificent tribune of gold brocade , which a procession of solemn personages , announced in turn by the strident voice of an usher , is entering through a small gothic doorway
hercules did not scorn the title of musagetes
a ladder , artlessly placed outside , afforded communication between stage and dressing room , and its steep rungs had to serve for exits as well as entrances
you mean jupiter ’ s part ?
then , pointing out with his right hand stretched out some of the people crawling about outside the mole , looking for gold dust on the sand :
listen , my dear similar … esmenarda—forgive me , but you have such a prodigiously saracen name that i can ’ t get it out straight
the first two women walked with the step peculiar to parisians showing provincials around paris
her broad-sleeved hyacinth robe was tight at the waist and flared out below
the priest looked at her with the eye of a kite which has long been hovering in circles high up in the sky around a poor lark cowering in the corn , which has long been silently contracting the formidable circles of its flight , has suddenly fallen upon its prey like lightning , and holds it quivering in its claws
then there was a terrible collision , like the crash of two fleets engaging
yes , but how am i to go about it ?
why should the world think of me when i don ’ t think of it ?
finally on that evening , as the surroundings of khamon looked deserted , he had rapidly crossed the bar , and landed near the arsenal , entry to the port being clear
the two men from ghent came up
but they discovered a breach in the massive wall , and went through
it was as though that hand were riveted to her arm
belleforêt , father le juge , and corrozet assure us that next day it was collected with great ceremony by the local clergy and borne to the treasury of the church of sainte-opportune , where up to number the sacristan made a tidy income from the great miracle of the statue of the virgin on the corner of the rue mauconseil who had , by the mere fact of her presence , on the memorable night of number to number january number exorcized the deceased eustache moubon who , to trick the devil , had , as he died , cunningly hidden his soul in his palliasse
granted , said the president
that was the jewel that caused her downfall , in ’ number
even if i had seen ranged against her all the armies on earth , and the flames of siege rise higher than the temples , i would still have believed her eternal !
the girl felt her elbow roughly seized
science all by itself is well able to emaciate , wither , and dry up human faces ; it does not need old age to bring to it faces already wrinkled
there it was that quasimodo , after his frantic and triumphant dash over the towers and galleries , had set down la esmeralda
when the din became too great , gisco put his elbow on his ivory sceptre and stayed motionless , looking at the sea , fingers plunged into his beard
for his part , the priest had groped his way back to his cell
a few people stood around
the wind blew from the direction of the ravine
subject of the kingdom of argot ?
hamilcar ordered the numidians to advance
it was a crowd of old men , the sick , children of fifteen , and even women , who , yielding to their anguish , had come out from carthage and , wanting the protection of something formidable , had taken from hamilcar ’ s palace the only elephant still owned by the republic – the one whose trunk had been cut off
i have seen all that , replied the former slave , in syria , in the town of maphug ; ’ and they went up a flight of six silver steps into the third enclosure
then , when he had covered two thirds of the mountainside , he drew gisco ’ s head from his chest and holding it by the beard whirled it several times round with his arm – and when the mass was finally thrown it described a long parabola and disappeared behind the punic rampart
giddenem answered that it was necessary in order to tame them
imagine salvator rosa ’ s battle picture turned into bacchanalia
standing like that , shaken by sobs , he was more wretched and imploring than on his knees
a moment later he had to lean over again , and dame aloïse said : have you ever seen a more attractive and cheerful figure than your betrothed ?
you won ’ t give me any money ? —no ? —in that case i ’ m going to become a truand
he studied the science of herbs , the science of unguents
so you are very unhappy ?
in the people ’ s minds this debt was confused with the , talents demanded by lutatius and they were , like rome , an enemy of carthage
some , thinking that they needed to eat a lot to become strong , gorged themselves , others , hampered by their corpulence , wore themselves out with fasts in order to lose weight
then with her elbows against her sides , forearms straight out and hands open , throwing back her head beneath the moonbeams , she said :
tristan , keep your eyes on this man !
the vague idea of some immolation soon circulated among the people
it hardly roused her , but she tied her hair over her ears to shut it out and went back to gazing on bended knees at the inanimate object which she had been worshipping for the past fifteen years
his strength , so extraordinarily developed , was a further cause of viciousness
i love my captain
notre-dame de paris is not , however , what can be called a complete , definite , classifiable monument
she would be a beauty , a virtue , a queen
the poor little devil had a wart over his left eye , his head down between his shoulders , his spine all bent , his breastbone sticking out , his legs crooked ; but he looked lively ; and although it was impossible to tell what language he was mouthing , his cry betokened a certain health and strength
then he saw again the lemon-groves , goatherds on the grey mountains ; and his heart leaped at the idea of another carthage established there
when quasimodo saw that the cell was empty , that the gypsy was no longer there , that while he was defending her she had been abducted , he gripped his hair with both hands and stamped the ground in surprise and grief
as there seems to be some sorcery involved in the affair , the bishop and his official have intervened in the case and my brother , who is archdeacon of josas , spends all his time on it
the ten fingers were cut off
she would slip them into the little shoes , take them out , admire them , marvel at them , look at the light through them , feel sorry when she tried walking them across her bed , and would gladly have spent the rest of her life on her knees covering and uncovering those feet as if they had belonged to a baby jesus
the archdeacon had just sat down by the light from a triple brass candleholder in front of a huge chest laden with manuscripts
a brief silence ensued
he had to tilt his head back in order to see
although of most noble birth , he had in the course of his military service contracted more than one of the common soldiery ’ s habits
threw in kapouras , a very illustrious merchant
she made her lovely hand taut so that she could bruise his face : go away , you devil !
there ’ s another on my left with such long teeth that they hide his chin
i tried to come to you !
then sticking out her lower lip , she pouted slightly in what seemed like a familiar expression with her , turned on her heel , and began collecting the crowd ’ s contributions in a tambourine
but it was too late
with each wave it plunged under the foam ; but the sun embalmed it ; it became harder than gold ; yet the eyes never stopped weeping , and the tears fell continuously into the water
the barbarians were suddenly alone
you won ’ t take her from me , i ’ m sure
taanach disappeared , and schahabarim , raising an arm in the air , began :
they were waiting with a shudder of excitement for the ultimate blow , the one that would rip it open
the executioner likes that
moreover , there was no fracture of the vertebrae of the neck , and it was obvious that he had not been hanged
i ’ ve spent fifteen years in this cellar , without a fire in winter
if it is summer , he is creeping about in the yard , in the garden , pulling up grass from between the paving stones , looking innocently at the big dogs , the big horses , quite unafraid , playing with the ornamental shells , the flowers , and making the gardener grumble at finding sand in the flowerbeds and soil on the paths
it was their day , their feast of fools , their saturnalia , annual orgy of law clerks and students
meanwhile , four mounted sergeants who have just stationed themselves at the four corners of the pillory have already concentrated around them a fair proportion of the populace scattered across the square , who condemn themselves to boredom and immobility in the hope of seeing some minor punishment executed
clemency is a fine royal virtue and stems the flow of anger
the king appeared quite unperturbed by such a display
in the fields both far and wide
salammbo did not understand how this young man could ever become her master !
this had been autharitus ’ idea ; but mâtho disapproved
however , neither stags nor bulls existed in carthage
that ’ s true enough , little girl , said la montmichel
the arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means made him let go , and while prelates and ambassadors packed into the stalls of the tribune , as tightly as real flemish herrings in a barrel , he had made himself comfortable , boldly crossing his legs on the architrave
he read out the list of their punishments ; they will be sent to work at paving the streets , fitting out ships , embellishing the syssitia , and the others will be sent to scratch the earth in the cantabrian mines !
they are just as entertaining as animals and women , and not so treacherous
the effort was mighty , prodigious , desperate ; but the provostry ’ s old restraints held out
but the three beggars would not let him go , and tore him away from the others , shouting : he ’ s ours !
they made a special fuss over the pretty feet and the pretty shoes
are its horns really made of gold ?
you don ’ t come from france ?
it drove everything else from his mind , even his literary interests , even his great work de figuris regularibus et irregularibus ’ [ on regular and irregular figures ’ ] , which he intended to have printed as soon as he was next in funds
then he struggled in his bonds , and his frenzied convulsions made the old pillory wheel creak on its boards
this tabard was on offer
they prepared to die
the girl was sitting by the window , still embroidering her neptune ’ s grotto
since then the great city has suffered more and more disfigurement , day by day
and the chaplains of the sainte-chapelle with their grey amices , cum tunicis grisis !
i don ’ t trust the sort of gentleness that has pinched nostrils and thin lips
he presented himself there as a saviour , with six thousand men , all carrying flour under their cloaks , and forty elephants laden with forage and dried meat
he plunged down it
these symptoms of some violent moral preoccupation had reached a particularly high degee of intensity by the time of our story
supposing you were to come with me , father ?
this did not increase her fright , but transformed it
but shaven greeks , whiter than marble , threw behind them the peelings from their plate , while shepherds from bruttium , dressed in wolf skins , munched in silence , heads bent over their food
a dog was running along the wall
the suffete and the slave went off into a distant corner of the room
the hearing was suspended
all the stewards stood with arms crossed , heads bowed , while abdalonim proudly lifted his pointed mitre
the whole band burst out : ho there !
the carthaginians too were preparing
no , said spendius , take me to the temple of tank
there were temples with twisted pillars , bronze capitals , and metal chains , cones of dry stone with azure stripes , copper cupolas , marble architraves , babylonian buttresses , obelisks balancing on their points like upturned torches
could she have killed herself ?
most people had been content to hold rolande ’ s memory sacred and make relics out of her rags
who would ever believe it ?
as for phoebus , he laughed and took the gypsy ’ s part with a mixture of impertinence and pity
they were driven back with arrows , so great was the terror
fair cousin phoebus , suddenly said fleur-de-lys , as you know that little gypsy , signal to her to come up
at his feet a few hens were pecking as they foraged in the undergrowth , enamelled beetles ran about in the sunshine ; above his head a few clusters of dappled-grey clouds were scudding across a blue sky ; on the horizon the steeple of the abbey of saint-victor thrust its slate-covered obelisk across the curving contour of the hillside , and the miller of the butte copeaux whistled as he watched the sails of his windmill diligently spinning round
dogs were roaming about with their black muzzles stained with red
djali , said the girl
quite out of breath he went into the great bell ’ s airy chamber ; gazed at it for a moment in loving reverence ; then spoke softly to it , stroked it with his hand , like some good horse about to run a long race
there , sitting above them , gringoiure went on , who is that stout , red-faced man all in a sweat ?
it ’ s a fine way for a king to be lavish
you must have good eyesight if you can recognize him from here !
mâtho seemed to see them and grew angry
in your place you left me , my fair one , went on the captain , whose tongue was loosened now that he was speaking to a girl from the streets , a pretty surly rascal , one-eyed and hunchbacked , the bishop ’ s bell-ringer , as i believe
what does it matter to you ?
all kinds of people follow behind poets
we have only to draw the curtains
mothers have that kind of strength
before he had even finished his exordium the sweat was already running off his brow and his eyes were bulging
he observed how attentive the ugly , deaf creature was , how obedient , how delicate and submissive his behaviour to the gypsy
there was no doubt in people ’ s minds that the day had come when , in accordance with their pact , quasimodo , that is the devil , was to carry off claude frollo , that is the sorcerer
here and there along its length vague , shapeless masses crawled , all moving towards the light flickering at the end of the street , like those heavy insects which at night drag themselves along from one blade of grass to the next towards a shepherd ’ s fire
what did you do with it ?
he stopped for a moment , leaned against a marker-stone like a drunken man , then again took up the trail of the two merry rascals
i know that phoebus isn ’ t dead !
dramatic surprise , reversal of fortune
and she heard a still more bitter voice tell her in her inmost heart : she ’ s a rival !
dom claude , sunk deep in his own thoughts , was no longer listening
said dom claude , this is the last money you will get from me
i don ’ t know , answered gringoire
… nothing easier—a sudden raid—under cover of the disorder , she can easily be snatched away
i want you to tell me if you love me
said clopin , here are men afraid of a joist
it is not a virtue of which the finest examples are to be found among men
but the nearer she came to it , the slower her steps
alas , he said as if hesitating to finish the phrase : the fact is … i ’ m deaf
don ’ t go lying to me , you old spectre , he went on
he swore to himself , since his companions had appointed him schalischim , to wage war ; the certainty that he would not come back alive drove him to make it ruthless
the three men in black robes were waiting for him in the great hall , standing against the stone disc
hamilcar had done this to gratify his army ’ s instincts and , by this treachery , to bind them to himself
i am only a historian
the archdeacon replied unmoved : there are certain things which i think about in a certain way
but why was he sending it off ?
djali , she said , how i had forgotten you !
half-eaten corpses blocked the streets
it is notre-dame the people are besieging
but the town was protected by a lake communicating with the sea
there will in fact still be time tomorrow for us to cut slashes and buttonholes in each other ’ s birthday suits
but the poor deaf ringer heard
others have thought , the archdeacon continued pensively , that it would be better to work with a beam from sirius
the king spoke so quietly that the flemings could not hear anything of his dictation except occasional isolated scraps like : … maintain fertile areas by trade , and infertile ones by manufacture … show the english lords our four bombards , the london , the brabant , the bourg-en-bresse , the saint-omer … artillery is the reason why war is waged now more judiciously … to monsieur de bressuire , our friend … armies can not be maintained without tribute … etc
she had been wanting a child for a long time
she stuck out her lower lip in her pretty little pout
meanwhile daylight continued to fade
finally , right at the back , near the door , there stood in the dark , still as a statue , a sturdy , thick-set man , in military equipment , and an emblazoned tunic , whose square face , with eyes sticking out from his head , split by a huge mouth , ears concealed beneath two wide screens of flattened hair , with no forehead , took after both dog and tiger
then a garamant came through the crowd , brandishing a sickle ; everyone understood his intention ; their faces flushed deeply and full of shame they shouted : yes !
older than the metropolis , it could not forgive the latter ’ s greatness ; it stood facing its walls , squatting in the mud at the water ’ s edge , like a poisonous beast watering
but taanach set up in front of her a copper mirror of such height and breadth that she could see all of herself in it
the few lights went out , the broader streets fell silent , then shadows slipped through the darkness
but there they are , pursuing you
it ’ s a book of peter lombard , the master of the sentences
to soften him salammbo said plaintively :
and as he spoke the young rascal was stealthily getting his crossbow ready
in the midst of his reverie there was a knock at the door
gringoire suddenly exclaimed , we are as bright and cheerful as [ if we had all been changed into owls like ] ascalaphus !
in a few minutes i felt gross earthly things recede into the distance , and i was calm , dazzled , and serene again in the presence of the tranquil radiance of eternal truth
what have the years , what have men done to these marvels ?
the young student jehan frollo du moulin cried out from his corner
with their tent poles they built a great fire ; fire could not burn the mountain
hamilcar had a fire of wet straw lit on the roof of khamon : and blinded by the smoke they fell back to the left and swelled the dreadful throng driving into malqua
when someone asked cercidas of megalopolis if he would die gladly , he answered : why not ?
there was no hurry yet , thought hamilcar ; and he went down into the prison
[ where are you going , man ?
however the god ’ s appetite was not appeased
her hair fell over her shoulders as it had that morning
a smile parted his teeth , gleaming amid his black beard , and in his half-closed lids there was a silent and almost outrageous gaiety
was he contriving a final plan , of death for her and damnation for himself ?
but then she would have had to have left by the porte de vesle , and that doesn ’ t fit in
these two great thoroughfares , intersecting with the first two , formed the canvas backing on which lay the labyrinthine street network of paris , knotted and pulled in every direction
it was jehan du moulin who struck the first spark
the aforesaid dolphin , then , was young , handsome , strong , and above all ( magnificent origin of all the royal virtues ! )
as the house goes up i am being ruined
meanwhile the clerk , just as maître florian barbedienne was reading over the sentence in his turn before signing it , felt moved by pity for the poor devil who had been condemned and , in the hope of obtaining some mitigation of the punishment , came as close as he could to the auditor ’ s ear and said to him , pointing to quasimodo : that man is deaf
the moon was rising at sea level , and specks of light , of whiteness shone out over the town , still plunged in darkness ; a wagon shaft in a courtyard , a scrap of cloth hanging up , the corner of a wall , a golden collar on a god ’ s chest
he had returned to a position a few yards from them , behind his pillar , where he listened , watched , relished
and to you , mighty men in shining armour who have set me free !
the other barbarians , encamped away on the isthmus , were surprised at these delays ; they muttered ; and they were let loose
wrinkles and warts on its skin are the work of time ; marks of violence , brutality , contusions , fractures , the work of revolutions from luther to mirabeau
for a time he hesitated
they thought how empty their courage was
he said , what a big letter !
hamilcar was in despair ; all were going to perish thanks to mâtho ’ s genius and the mercenaries ’ invincible courage !
it came from a dummy which the truands were suspending with the rope round its neck , a kind of scarecrow , dressed in red , and laden with enough jingling , tinkling little bells to provide the harness for thirty castilian mules
in the sixteenth century the wall seemed to be visibly withdrawing , buried deeper and deeper in the old town , so dense already was the new one beyond it
where were the days when father guybertaut could earn number sols parisis with a song at a single coronation ?
but narr ’ havas was weak and would not take the risk alone ; and the suffete had the rampart raised by twelve palms , had all the material from the arsenal piled in the acropolis and once more had the machines repaired
what say you , maître guillaume rym ?
then mâtho , raising his arm towards the planet of chabar , cried :
mighty carthage , mistress of the seas , splendid as the sun and terrible as god , there existed men who dared to attack her !
but he was not even tempted to go and see her there
quasimodo could not hear the laugh , but he saw it
yes , from that day on there was a man in me whom i did not know
this very night , do you hear ?
said gringoire , because she is my wife and i am her husband
the flames were stifled by bloodsoaked cloaks thrown over their faces from a distance
my mother ’ s a bird—my father ’ s another
no , i have nothing more to teach you !
however , he risked a look at the church
autharitus ’ army still remained in front of tunis
little girl , little girl , la christeuil went on with an implacable smile , if you wore decent sleeves on your arms they wouldn ’ t get so sunburnt
but the narrower ranks slipped under the longer ones , returned to their place , and the phalanx turned round against the barbarians , as deadly from the side as it had just been from the front
thus an immense mass , what the romans called insula , an island , of private dwellings , flanked to right and left by two blocks of palaces , one crowned by the louvre , the other by the tournelles , bordered on the north by a long belt of abbeys and cultivated enclosures , the whole amalgamated and fused as one watched ; above these hundreds of buildings whose roofs of tiles and slates stood out against one another to form so many strange ridges and chains , the tattooed , embossed , guilloched steeples of the forty-four churches on the right bank ; innumerable streets crisscrossing ; bounded on one side by an enclosure of high walls with square towers ( that of the university had round towers ) ; on the other by the seine , which was intersected by bridges and bore a heavy traffic of boats : such was the town in the fifteenth century
that ’ s his whole court
he was counting on some event , something decisive and extraordinary
the soldiers took the money from the bags to pelt hanno with
then he stretched his bow with all his might , resting the bottom of it against the toe of his left foot ; he aimed , the arrow sped off
the white-feathered creature , disturbed by the noise , would break off , look all round as calmly as a cormorant on a rock , then plunge in its hideous yellow beak again ; and the desperate man would fall back into the dust
it splintered against the corner of a wall
i suspected as much , said gringoire
i think it ’ s young smeralda doing her mummeries with her goat
but the fires , in too confined a space , set fire to neighbouring walls , and long flames suddenly shot out of the houses like blood spurting from an artery
they had just left when a commotion arose outside the door
their innumerable carvings of devils and dragons took on a macabre appearance
she broke off abruptly and started fondling djali
in this year fifty-six cries to the sound of a trumpet have been made by judicial order at the crossroads in paris—account to be settled
anyone today curious to visit this door will recognize it from the following inscription , carved in white letters on the black wall : i adore coralie number signed ugéne
here and there were dotted about tents where in the daytime were sold depilatory pastes , perfumes , clothes , moon-shaped cakes , and images of the goddess with models of the temple , hollowed out of a block of alabaster
the suffete ordered that thirty-two of the elephants should stand in the river a hundred paces further on , while the others , downstream , would stop the lines of men swept away by the current ; and all of them , holding their weapons above their heads , crossed the macar as if between two walls
certainly at that moment he was even more grotesque and repulsive than pitiable , with his streaming , purple face , his distraught eye , his mouth frothing with rage and pain , his tongue half lolling out
at the end , beside a tall chimney breast emblazoned with coats of arms from top to bottom , in a sumptuous red velvet armchair , sat the dame de gondelaurier , whose number years were written no less clearly on her clothes than on her features
once up in the lofty cage of the bell chamber , quasimodo , sadly shaking his head , contemplated for a time the six bells there , as if bemoaning some alien intruder which had interposed itself in his heart between them and himself
she was holding the blade up high
these horrible missiles bore letters engraved on them which imprinted themselves on the victim ’ s body ; and on corpses insults could be read , like swine , jackal , vermin , and sometimes jokes : catch !
he sent for horses from cyrenaica , armour from bruttium , and he began the war again
have you kept some by for the corpses ?
clopin trouillefou preaches like our holy father the pope , cried the emperor of galilee , smashing his pot to prop up his table
her eyes and her diamonds flashed ; her polished nails were a continuation of the fine jewels on her fingers ; the two clasps of her tunic raised her breasts a little and brought them closer together , and in his imagination he was lost in the narrow cleft between them , down which hung a thread holding an emerald plaque , which could be seen lower down under the violet gauze
the fact is that he was king ’ s counsellor for the jurisdiction of the treasury
as you wish , so i can do
anyway , beside the door there ’ s a vine in the sun that cheers me up when i ’ m drinking
so gothic paris was complete only for a minute
he gathered him into his cassock and carried him off
there were cries and calls ; hobbled horses stood in long straight lines in the middle of the tents , which were variously round , square , leather , canvas ; there were rush huts and holes in the sand such as dogs make
the poet ’ s already ailing doublet gave its last gasp in the struggle
maître coppenole himself applauded ; and clopin trouillefou , who had been a competitor , and goodness knows the intense degree of ugliness his face could attain , confessed himself beaten
we have come on a matter known to you… your son !
he thought of the unfortunate girl who had caused his ruin , and whom he had ruined
cried the wretched girl
this was not how he had hoped to return !
they want to hang you again
the zaïmph sparkled , covered with radiance
aren ’ t her hands just perfect ?
i am racked by remorse and creditors
the priests of ceres , dressed in blue robes , had wisely stopped in the street of satheb , and were chanting in a low voice a thesmophorion in megarian dialect
her pure , rose-red lips were half smiling ; her calm , innocent forehead was at times overclouded by her thoughts , like a mirror by a breath ; and from her long , dark , lowered eyelashes shone a kind of ineffable light which gave her profile that ideal sweetness which raphael later found at the mystic point of intersection of virginity , maternity , and divinity
a skirt with variegated stripes , tight at the waist , hung down to her ankles , where two pewter rings clashed together
this central , generative church is a kind of chimera among the old churches of paris ; it has the head of one , the limbs of another , the rear of a third ; something of all of them
but instead of keeping his position to cover the infantry , narr ’ havas turned sharply to the right , as though he wanted to be crushed by hamilcar
this last of the barbarians represented to them all the barbarians , all the army ; they avenged themselves on him for all their disasters , terrors , opprobrium
one second more and it would all be over
down with the chancellor of sainte-geneviève !
said salammbo : the spirit of the gods lives in sweet savours
beat swords , keep on beating !
mâtho , who could not understand such indifference , suspected the greek of having a genius he did not want to talk about
at this point jacques coictier , who had been unseated by the archdeacon ’ s fiery replies , put himself back in the saddle , and interrupted him with the triumphant tone of one scholar correcting another : erras , amice claudi [ you are mistaken , friend claude ]
it ’ s in your interest that we thrash you , so as to harden you against beatings
and as she sat down , she gracefully held out her tambourine to the goat
he sat breathing heavily on the cushions , looking at her almost tenderly , as if he found in that sight some relaxation from his weariness
she cried , quite overcome
from the height at which he stood all the torches on their bronze stems seemed like a huge wreath of lights , set level with the floor ; the black smoke which they gave off rose up into the darkness of the ceiling ; and for some minutes the silence was so profound that the noise of the sea could be heard in the distance
it had at first been proposed that he should be flayed alive , that molten lead should be poured into his insides , that he should be starved to death ; that he should be tied to a tree and that a monkey , behind him , should hit him on the head with a stone : he had offended tank , tank ’ s baboons would avenge her
he felt humiliated at having defended them ; and as he could not avenge himself on the soldiers , or the elders , or on salammbo , or on anyone , and as his anger was looking for someone , at one blow he condemned all the garden slaves to the mines
what do i intend to do with it , august king of tunis ?
between the rues saint-martin and saint-denis extended the enclosure of the trinité
maître pierrat… i mean maître jacques , you take care of marc cenaine
sun , she repeated
you have thought up a stratagem for getting her out of notre-dame safely , but your plan is extremely unpleasant for me , for gringoire
spendius recognized them ; he held back a cry
mâtho , like a drunken man , slept lying on his side , with one arm projecting over the edge of the couch
it was while he was still lying on a sickbed at the surgeon ’ s house that he had undergone the first interrogation of philippe lheulier and the official ’ s inquisition , which he had found very tiresome
here ’ s her shoe , all that i have left of her
finally they were allowed to go , and in a kind of homage to moloch or from some vague destructive urge , they tore down great cypresses in the temple woods , and lighting them from the cabiri ’ s torches , carried them through the streets singing
salammbo walked beneath it , slowly ; then she crossed the terrace to go and sit at the back , on a kind of throne cut out of a turtle-shell
the doves seemed to be coming down towards the sea , gradually ; then they disappeared as though swallowed up and falling of their own accord into the sun ’ s maw
you have come back to see us perish , haven ’ t you ?
but if the siege of the towns was lifted , their inhabitants would come out , attack them from behind , and they would have the carthaginians in front of them
that ’ s no drink for january
human thought discovered a means of perpetuating itself not only more durable and more resistant than architecture , but simpler and easier
said the former slave , if your heart is bold , i will lead you into carthage
its huge muzzle drooped on to its chest , and its two forepaws , half concealed under its luxuriant mane , were widely separated like the wings of a bird
some of them kissed his hands ; others , bowing low , came up to him to ask for orders ; for now he was the real , sole leader of the barbarians ; spendius , autharitus and narr ’ havas were discouraged , and he had shown such boldness and obstinacy that everyone obeyed him
[ the abbot of saint-martin , that is the king of france , is by custom a canon and holds the minor prebend held by saint venantius and should sit in the treasurer ’ s seat ]
its tenor was brief and simple
quasimodo saw the windows of the gondelaurier mansion light up from top to bottom of the façade
phoebus felt the stranger ’ s cold hand slip a large coin into his own
how cruelly dice , pots of beer , and venus have gutted you !
after all , ran his thoughts , more or less , she must live somewhere ; gypsy women are kind-hearted—who knows ?
in front of each corridor elephant tusks , set upright with their points together , formed an arch above the door
he stiffened up on the spout , pushed away from the wall with both knees , clung by his hands to a crack between the stones , and managed to climb up a foot , perhaps ; but this commotion caused the lead spout supporting him suddenly to bend over
said mâtho , moloch ’ s curse weighs heavy on me
at night the gates were closed , the river at each end of the town was barred with great iron chains , and paris slept peacefully
he found dom claude much changed , pale as a winter ’ s morning , hollow-eyed , hair almost white
the hôtel de ville , i tell you
animals and money were despatched
since she had been down there she had been neither awake nor asleep
do you have the password ?
all the hidden treasures in the louvre will melt away in such a blaze of expense !
the internal opening of these spouts was in the floor of the platform
i ’ m going to see it !
michelangelo , who already in the sixteenth century no doubt felt that it was dying , had one last idea , an idea born of despair
i am not telling lies
his income equalled that of the barcas
there was the sumptuous square steeple of saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie , its angles all rounded with sculptures , already admirable in the fifteenth century though still unfinished
summon up your will and stop imploring the gods , for they do not turn aside for the cries of men !
i had my gold écu
mâtho facing him could find nothing to answer
this was the fearsome formula which customarily concluded these sombre ceremonies
they all rushed off to the maison-aux-piliers
every cathedral is a thousand million francs
they cried out for women
said the archdeacon , with a nod of his head
the barbarians could catch them up , crush them all
then a faint white curve showed up vaguely , and they found themselves on the bank of the macar
then he turned to his acolytes from the officiality : there at last justice is enlightened !
and the gilded chamber ?
the barbarians broke through their lines ; slaughtered them with their swords ; they tripped over the dying and the dead , blinded by the blood spurting from their faces
the provinces quake at your fury , the furrows are full of corpses !
with one hand he seized hannibal , tore off with the other the edging of a garment lying about , bound his feet , his hands , stuffed the end into his mouth as a gag and hid him under the ox-hide bed , under a wide drapery hanging down to the floor
] ’ then he began to sing , with a faraway look as if in ecstasy , in the tones of a canon chanting vespers : quae cantica !
the soldiers recognized this recumbent figure as the suffete hanno , the man who by his slowness had helped to lose the battle of the aegates islands ; and as for his victory over the libyans at hecatompylus , if he had acted mercifully , it was out of greed , the barbarians thought , for he had sold all the captives on his own account , though he had declared their death to the republic
that does no one any harm , and it makes number deniers parisis for the matrons , who are poor women
his wild eye bore a singular expression ; a look both enchanted and gentle
then they wandered round , lost in the complications of the architecture
it was a great purple litter , with bunches of ostrich feathers decorating the corners
and the man answering : i have fewer years to live !
how i envy you sometimes !
you , the hundred members of the council of carthage , you lied when you accused my daughter !
i have got everything ready
these were the canaanite baalim , doubles of the supreme baal , going back to their principal , to be humbled before his power and brought to naught before his splendour
a fig for aristotle !
but for the gods , would i ever have dared ! … let us go away !
he muttered between his teeth
the return of the zaïmph , vaguely reported , completed the miracle
the judge thought it had been answered , and continued :
cried the suffete ; and through the smoke his eyes flashed like torches at this tall man who began to understand
a few students had stayed astride the window ledges and were looking out on to the place
from their gestures of mimicry , their roars of laughter , the banter and jeering cries they exchanged with one another from one end of the hall to the other , it was obvious that these young clerks did not share the boredom and weariness of those present , and knew very well how to turn the sight before their eyes into an entertainment for their private pleasure which gave them patience to wait for the other
and to you , gods hidden beneath the mountains and in the caverns of the earth !
needless to say , they picked up the money first , and the archdeacon followed them
he seemed stupefied by their daring ; he called his captains
nego [ i deny that ] , retorted the advocate
the old louvre of philip-augustus , that building out of all proportion whose massive tower grouped around it twenty-three major towers , not counting turrets , seemed from a distance to be inset into the gothic rooftops of the hôtel d ’ alençon and the petit-bourbon
it did not matter that one did not worship the stars , believing certain constellations to be favourable or fatal , one still sacrificed to them ; some unknown amulet , found by chance amid some danger , became a divinity ; or it could be a name , merely a name , which one repeated without even trying to understand what it might mean
this great noise and great glare had drawn the barbarians to the foot of the walls ; clinging to the wrecked helepolis to get a better view , they watched , aghast with horror
then using both hands she finished breaking and pushing clear the rusty stumps of the bars
you can open your eyes again
the gate of malqua opened
so , changing his mind , he sent him by taanach the best things from the kitchens ; a joint of goat , beans , and pomegranate preserve
i know one girl who is dying of rage because of it… ’
the unfortunate bell-ringer dropped to his knees in the doorway , and clasped his great shapeless hands beseechingly : oh !
by the hundred torches of your intelligences !
he ’ s bald , he added , stooping down ; he ’ s an old man !
however , some people at cabaret-les-vantes said they had seen her go by on the paris road , walking barefoot on the stones
don ’ t beat the picards , noli , joannes , verberare picardos
there ’ s something i must tell you
they rushed headlong to the carthaginian prisoners
hide in that corner
in this corridor , against the cliff wall , ladders had been set out in advance ; and protected by the diversions of the crevasses , the velites , before being caught , were able to seize them and climb up
has been left without one ;
he found the strength to look
what good are these old ones to me ?
the moon herald who watched every night on top of eschmoûn ’ s temple , to give signals on his trumpet about the movements of the celestial body , noted one morning , over to the occident , something like a bird skimming the surface of the sea with its long wings
come to me , taanach , kroûm , ewa , micipsa , schaaoûl !
so saying , she turned round to phoebus
what is this then ?
there was still a somewhat sulky tone in fleur-de-lys ’ s brief words
hamilcar went down the three steps ; from a silver basin he took a llama skin floating in some black liquid
it caused , therefore , no little surprise and alarm when just as quasimodo , in this state of semi-intoxication , was passing triumphantly before the maison-aux-piliers , a man was seen suddenly to dart from the crowd , and with an angry gesture tear from quasimodo ’ s hands the gilded wooden crozier , emblem of his fools ’ papacy
alas , no , maître jacques replied , still smiling sadly
a poor man found her little golden cross hung on the stone cross in the field where they hold the fair
now i ’ m trembling and shivering , i ’ m failing at the decisive moment , i feel something supreme enfolding us , and i stammer
salammbo had parted the canvas , held it up at the end of her arm , and , without answering him , was looking in the direction of hamilcar
a child , i say ! —a pretty little girl ! —my agnés , she went on , distraught , kissing some object in the shadows
don ’ t condemn us both
between these two patches of white , the left bank of the seine , at which he was gazing , thrust forth its dark mass , and dwindling steadily in perspective , plunged into the hazy horizon like a black arrow
more arrived every moment
he carried a basket under one arm and a mattress under the other
from his earliest steps among men he had felt , then seen himself the object of jeers , condemnation , rejection
he mended old breastplates
it was said that he had tasted successively all the apples from the tree of knowledge and , whether from hunger or disgust , had ended by biting the forbidden fruit
the vermilion on her lips made her teeth look whiter , and the antimony on her eyelids made her eyes look longer
spendius hesitated ; he was trembling ; finally , addressing the libyans , who were most numerous , he said :
but not vicious on that account
and she began pacing up and down before the bars of her window , dishevelled , eyes blazing , banging her shoulder against the wall , with the wild look of a caged she-wolf which has long been hungry and feels feeding time draw near
the carts ’ axles sometimes became caught in the streets ; the devout would then profit from the opportunity to touch the baalim with their clothes , which they would subsequently keep as holy objects
they did not have beards , or hair , or eyebrows ; in their hands , sparkling with rings , they carried immense lyres and they were all singing , in shrill voices , a hymn to the divinity of carthage
he never pulls a tooth from me but it turns out to be a diamond
the guards drove off the mob of soldiers with their whips ; and soon the captains of the spartiate phalanxes and the leaders of the barbarian cohorts arrived , with their rank badges and the armour of their nations
it opened on to a huge square , where a thousand scattered lights flickered in the hazy night fog
she had begun making blunders , and realized with terror that she was not saying what she should have said
she will give in !
finally the tumult died down and the soldiers went away to begin again
then he dived back under the twisting vault of the spiral staircase and went down again
he cherished them like parts of his own person , of his hatred , and it made his spirits rise , his arm feel stronger ; all that had to be accomplished appeared clearly to him
have you seen her great eyes under the wide eyebrows , like twin suns beneath triumphal arches ?
the canons of sainte-geneviève !
thus in france you can still read over the wicket of the seigneurial prison at tourville : sileto et spera [ be silent and hope ] ; in ireland , under the shield placed on top of the main gate of the castle of fortescue : forte scutum , salus ducum [ a strong shield , the safety of leaders ] ; in england , over the main entrance to the hospitable manor of the earls cowper : tuum est [ it is yours ]
the nomads ’ wives swayed in their square , dun-coloured dresses of dromedary hair ; musicians from cyrenaica , swathed in violet gauze and with painted eyebrows , sang squatting on rush mats ; old negresses with pendulous breasts picked up for fuel animal droppings which they dried in the sun ; syracusan women had gold plates in their hair , the lusitanians seashell necklaces , the gauls wolfskins on their white breasts ; and sturdy children , verminous , naked , uncircumcised , butted passers-by in the stomach , or came up behind like tiger cubs to bite their hands
it was not death that made them go pale , but the horrible compulsion to which they were reduced
she had dragged herself along on her hands , then iron rings had cut into her ankles and there had been a clanking of chains
thunder rolled in the distance
the chief of perfumes admitted that he knew nothing about it , soldiers had arrived with knives , yelling : he had opened the boxes for them
a genius , she went on , is driving me on to this love
the panels cracked , the carvings flew in splinters , at each shock the hinges jumped on their hooks , the planks were dislodged , the wood was falling , ground into sawdust , between the iron ribbing
he walks : he ’ s bandy-legged
let me fish you back from the abyss !
a forest of lances , pikes , and swords bristled at its base
all the barbarians lay apathetically about on the ground
there was initial hesitation
the girl with the goat
the trees caught fire one after another , and the towering masses of greenery , from which emerged long white spirals , looked like volcanoes beginning to smoke
young man , went on the archdeacon , the last time the king made a solemn entry there was a gentleman called philippe de commines , who bore embroidered on his horse ’ s housing his motto , which i advise you to meditate upon : qui non laborat non manducet [ he who does not work , let him not eat ]
for the rest , the poor bellringer did not know what he , quasimodo , would do , what he would say , what he wanted
they made the same protestations in signs to the carthaginians standing by at sea
reverend master , he said gravely , your fame has reached even me , and i wanted to consult you
i am your majesty ’ s faithful vassal
jehan gave him a knowing , capable look , and clicked his fingers like castanets
then , the women of the neighbourhood would say , the whole church took on some element of the fantastic , supernatural , horrible ; eyes and mouths opened here and there ; you could hear barking from the stone dogs , wyverns , tarasques which keep watch day and night , neck outstretched and jaws open , round the monstrous cathedral ; and if it was a christmas night , while the great bell seemed to growl as it summoned the faithful to the blazing lights of midnight mass , the atmosphere spread over the sombre façade was such that the great doorway seemed to be swallowing up the crowd and the rose-window watching it
it was a room of some six square feet , with a little window and a door on to the gently inclined plane of the roof of flat stones
then , after one of these thuds , so violent that it made all three of them reel , they heard nothing more
gringoire would gladly have asked his neighbour : who wrote this masterpiece ?
no torches to be lit until we reach notre-dame !
they looked tired through long anxiety
here and there windows were beginning to sparkle like glowing embers
meanwhile la esmeralda remained standing
it has to be said that she was not too upset by this voluntary absence of the poor hunchback
the stranger approached the balustrade
meanwhile , for the past few minutes , unnoticed , bérangère had enticed the goat into a corner of the room with a bit of marzipan
it was the barbarians ’ army advancing on carthage
ordinary soldiers were known to have worn the diadem , and the fame of collapsing empires made the gaul dream in his oak forest , the ethiopian in his sandy wastes
hamilcar turned round , and saw beside him an abject-looking man , one of the wretches who lived as best he could in the household
revolt and brigandage have no part in apollo ’ s company
do you still have , he said , those little gazelle horns on which you hung your necklets ?
maître andry , jehan went on , still hanging on to his capital , shut up , or i ’ ll drop on your head !
i ’ m going to tell you what up till now i hardly dared to tell myself when i furtively examined my conscience during those deep hours of the night when it is so dark that it seems as though god can no longer see us
she fell down in a faint
as if there were not enough misfortunes at the same time , it was learned that the mercenaries of sardinia had crucified their general , seized the fortresses and everywhere slaughtered men of canaanite race
but a cavalry force , debouching from a wood , drove them with pike and sabre back to the others ; and soon all the barbarians were down on the plain
isn ’ t the mystery ended ?
they are laying siege to our lady , my good mistress , in her own cathedral ! —get up , olivier
they yelled at the top of their voices , old eustache moubon , the ironmonger on the corner , has just died
you must follow me !
this witty sally made the wench laugh , and jehan left
by the pope ’ s belly !
a quarrel , a sword-thrust ; what is it to you ?
the captain , drunk with desire , pressed his ardent lips on those lovely african shoulders
coppenole grumbled , i am tired of standing
what is our brother the emperor asking for ?
he looked down on her trembling at his feet , he felt a kind of joy as he saw her suffer for his divinity , which he too could not completely embrace
claude ’ s compassion was increased by such ugliness ; and he vowed inwardly to bring up this child for love of his brother , so that , whatever faults jehan might commit in the future , there should stand to his credit this act of charity , performed for his sake
she would , despite her hatred , have liked to see mâtho again
my friends , i ’ d like someone to speak to me—the human voice comes as music to the human ear
seu de pellibus grisis fourratisl [ or lined with grey fur !
if she were not hamilcar ’ s daughter… ’
spendius envied his strength ; but for the dispatch of spies , the choice of sentries , skill in using machines and all defensive means , mâtho listened docilely to his companion ; and they no longer spoke of salammbo – the one did not think about it , the other was held back by a sense of shame
quasimodo would have needed only to stretch out his hand to haul him back from the gulf , but he simply did not look at him
and you enjoy that ?
suddenly he straightened up and his whole body trembled
she ’ s my daughter , do you see ?
they were all , however , oppressed by the same worry : they were afraid that the barbarians , seeing their own strength , would take it into their heads to stay on
once he raised his voice : pasque-dieu !
if you had been as fond of me as of him there would be great joy in carthage now !
what can i do ?
he said , spying in the darkness a lopsided sort of figure jerkily running towards him
we must put an end to it !
… beside which , to a mason who made the holes for setting in the grills over the windows , and the floor of the room where the cage is , because the floor would not have been strong enough to bear the cage because of its weight , number livres number sols parisis … ’
a barrel stood by the fire , and on the barrel sat a beggar
only the beardless priests understood salammbo
spendius emplaced the three largest catapults facing the three main angles ; in front of each gate he placed a ram , a balista in front of each tower , and carrobalistae would move round in the rear
it was an angel !
pour out gold by the ton !
several abandoned their companions ; they chose their army according as the fancy took them , and the gauls with autharitus went over to join the men from the cisalpine province whose language they understood
that reminds me , exclaimed dom claude , how is your royal patient ?
what can we do to rouse her ?
this first enclosure contained a wood of plane-trees , as a precaution against plague and infection from the air
has the good god no pity ? —oh !
and anyhow , i will soon know what you want from the movement of your lips and your eyes
now that their first joy was past they began to feel some anxiety
they waited for the thrice-holy feast when , from the top of a pyre , an eagle flew off into the sky , symbol of the year ’ s resurrection , the people ’ s message to their supreme baal , which they saw as a kind of union , a way of attaching themselves to the sun ’ s strength
spendius felt the ground and recognized that it was carefully carpeted with lynx-skins ; then they seemed to feel a large damp , cold , slimy rope slide between their legs
all we have to do then is thrash you for a week
muttered gudule , rummage in your devilish amulet !
camp to recover the zaïmph !
a few ashes on the coals !
he sang a nasal song , he swept the scythe ceaselessly out and back
there he adjusted the noose
such confidence would calm them
job appears on the philosophers ’ stone , which must also be tried and tormented to become perfect , as raymond lull says : sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima [ under the conservation of the specific form the soul is safe ]
they had forgotten the veil now , and were going to crush him
she was panting , dishevelled , a frightening sight , and the fire blazing in her eyes dried up any tears
such an enterprise as the truands were at that moment attempting against notre-dame was by no means rare in medieval towns
an architect of good taste ( number ) amputated it and thought it enough to conceal the wound with that large leaden patch that looks like a saucepan lid
it is a holy place which would be defiled by your eyes
he stressed the word someone ’ , and loosing the horse ’ s bridle said : off with you !
her soul was filled with silence , one of those abysses in which the whole world disappears beneath the pressure of a single thought , memory , look
from within carthage he had come to an understanding with masgaba , a gaetulian brigand who was trying to build an empire for himself
leaving the bastille , gringoire went down the rue saint-antoine with the speed of a runaway horse
then they resumed their march , in blazing sun , over hot ashes
quasimodo saw the truands scatter as the beam fell like ash blown by a child
phoebus once more seized the opportunity to bestow on her lovely neck as it bent over a kiss which made the girl straighten up , scarlet as a cherry
the money-changers at the crossroads rolled up the awnings of their booths
he also took from there the double ladder , which he set up right against the gibbet
the children sprawling about their legs would have scared a monkey
no ’ , coming after the oh !
do you know that my name is florian barbedienne , monsieur the provost ’ s own deputy , and , what is more , commissioner , investigator , comptroller and examiner with equal powers in the provostry , bailiwick , conservancy and presidial courts ?
thus , during the first six thousand years of the world ’ s existence , from the most immemorial pagoda of hindustan down to cologne cathedral , architecture was the great script of the human race
they had to be left outside
it was further remarked that for some little time his horror of gypsy women and zingari seemed to have intensified
yes , we have , said maître jacques , rummaging in his wallet
mâtho commanded his companions with the iberians , the lusitanians , the men from the west , and from the islands , and all those who spoke greek had asked for spendius , because of his intelligence
at that , she emerged from the state of collapse into which she had fallen for a few moments , and cried out , and while she spoke her voice at one moment rent the ear like a saw , at the next stammered as if every possible malediction had crowded upon her lips to burst out simultaneously
come to me , my phoebus !
two other rows of smaller basins extended on each side in parallel
from time to time the priests plucked muffled chords on their lyres , and in the intervals of the music could be heard the faint sound of her golden chain and the regular clacking of her papyrus sandals
mâtho whipped the canvas aside
he stopped , the shadow stopped
cohorts of infantry appeared ; they closed in ; and at the same time all the others saw foot soldiers running up with galloping horsemen
from behind the old woman spat out a curse
mâtho cried out as if wounded by a sword
the greeks dug pits with their sword points
now i can crush men like cockleshells , i can throw myself at the phalanxes , brush aside the sarissae with my hands , stop stallions with my hand in their nostrils ; even a catapult would not kill me !
all the steps are hollowed out underneath
added the old woman
and he sat down quite out of breath , wiping off great drops of sweat which fell from his brow like tears , soaking the parchments spread out before him
no one knew hamilcar ’ s plans
from all these countries the girl had brought back scraps of weird jargons , songs , and outlandish ideas , which made her way of speaking as motley as her costume , half parisian , half african
he kept it out of pride , or the fear of putting an end to uncertainty ; and he looked her in the eyes , with all his might , trying to grasp what lay hidden in the depths of her heart
his profile , although its lines were in no way noble , had a certain power and severity , his very deep-set eyes sparkled like a light in the depths of a cave , and beneath the cap pulled low over his face one could sense a genius ’ s brow turning over far-reaching plans
most of them went off on white mules
what the cell contained nobody knew ; but at night , from the shore by the terrain , there had often been seen , at a little window it had at the back of the tower , a strange , intermittent red glow , appearing , disappearing , reappearing at short , regular intervals , which seemed consistent with the puffing of a bellows and to come from a flame rather than a light
squatting in irregular groups they looked at each other in a daze and did not speak
instead of her sweet little agnès , so rosy and fresh , who was a gift from god , a kind of little monster , hideous , lame , one-eyed , misshapen , was dragging itself across the floor squawking
he even asked her whether , by chance , someone had not driven her into it ; and , with a nod of her head , she answered no , so proud was salammbo of having saved the zaïmph
but what particularly drew the eye , and held it long fixed on that spot , was the abbey itself
the presence of that gibbet was enough to impart to all its surroundings the most sinister air
he has some funny name , ember days , palm sunday , shrove tuesday , i don ’ t recall !
there was no head of any distinction which had not passed through his hands before falling to the executioner
with the fifteenth century everything changed
finally , and above all , it was gratitude
it was inaccessible , inexhaustible , infinite
the question gave the king thought
since the troop had ridden past , the archdeacon betrayed a certain agitation beneath his icy exterior
fair cousin , didn ’ t you tell us about some little gypsy girl you rescued from the hands of a dozen robbers one night two months ago , when you were on the counterwatch ?
this increased every evening when all went up on the terraces and let out a great cry , bowing nine times , to greet the sun
they were nearly all old women
thus , until the coming of gutenberg , architecture was the main , the universal form of writing
suddenly phoebus snatched off the gypsy ’ s gorget
breathing hard , with clenched teeth , she went on :
leave my beauty alone , and answer
phoenician colonies like carthage , they were self-governing and in treaties concluded by the republic had clauses inserted each time to distinguish them from it
there was indeed a man leaning on the topmost balustrade of the north tower , looking on to the grève
when they played at the discus , they conspired to crush his feet , and in boxing , with the first exchange of blows , smashed his jaw
she remained thoughtful for a moment , then she said with an odd expression : i shall soon know
beside the tumbril rode some officers of the police and the law , recognizable by their black costumes and their awkwardness in the saddle
the young man realized that it was essential to say something in her ear , some piece of nonsense , gallantry , anything
salammbo ’ s guide led her up past the lighthouse , towards the catacombs , then down through the long suburb of molouya , full of steep alleys
they were burned in the middle of the courtyards
they were closed like tombs
i have looked at you for so long !
they apologized to the dead for not being able to honour them as the rites prescribed : for , because of this deprivation , they would circulate for infinite periods , through all kinds of hazards and metamorphoses ; they called on them , asked them what they wanted ; others heaped insults on them for allowing themselves to be beaten
others walked right through the dishes on their crimson cloths and kicked to pieces the ivory stools and glass tyrian phials
mâtho imagined that the veil was the exclusive concern of men of canaanite race , and with his barbarian subtlety told himself : so the zaïmph will not do anything for me ; but since they have lost it , it will do nothing for them
it was an impenetrable place , communicating with the shore by a tunnel known only to him , and as he looked all round he took in a great draught of air
louis xi ’ s grave features contracted , but what could be seen of his emotion passed in a flash
he had no regrets , he was not sorry ; all he had done , he was ready to do again ; he would rather see her in the executioner ’ s hands than on the captain ’ s arm , but he was suffering ; suffering so much at times that he tore out handfuls of hair to see whether it had gone white
so saying he held out his cutlass to the priest
gringoire shook his head
finally the suffete went towards him and gravely said :
before trying anything , it was good to test the god ’ s arms
the student huddled under the furnace
this question brought a gleam of hope into jehan ’ s eyes
then the citizens of hippo-zarytus , on the pretext of an alarm , made hanno ’ s three hundred men go up on to their walls ; then , coming up behind them , they suddenly took them by the legs and heaved them over the ramparts
scatterbrain , muttered the archdeacon
it was like watching those young roman ladies who would amuse themselves by sticking gold pins into the breast of some beautiful slave girl
cried the suffete , what you don ’ t have on your face you must have on your shoulders !
although he was dying she saw him again in her tent , on his knees , with his arms around her waist , stammering gentle words ; she yearned to feel those arms , hear those words again ; she did not want him to die !
he has a fine beard !
very well , said colombe , the goat must entertain us in its turn and do a miracle for us
and from his purplish lips escaped a breath more noisome than the stench of a corpse
you are very moving , he said , wiping away a tear
and then , as he plunged further down the street , legless men , blind men , cripples , swarmed round him , and men with one arm , or with one eye , and lepers with their sores , some coming out of the houses , some from little side streets , some from the cellar openings , shouting , bellowing , yelping , all hobbling , bobbing along , hurrying towards the light , wallowing in the mire like slugs after rain
not one will be sold !
below sat the clerk of the court , scribbling away
three thousand feet of timber cut down at maschala , and at ubada granaries burst open and cisterns filled up !
her lovely features followed every caprice of her song with peculiar mobility , from the wildest inspiration to the chastest dignity
come along , said the priest
he said ; and they went off at a rapid pace , side by side , without speaking
suddenly , at the moment when the executioner ’ s assistants were preparing to carry out charmolue ’ s phlegmatic order , he climbed over the balustrade of the gallery , gripped the rope with feet , knees and hands , then they saw him slither down the façade , like a raindrop sliding along a window pane , run towards the two executioners as swiftly as a cat fallen from a roof , lay them low with his two huge fists , pick up the gypsy in one hand , like a child with its doll , and in a single bound leap back into the church , lifting the girl over his head and crying in a formidable voice : asylum !
what do you want with my religion ?
besides , now full of hate , they naively turned to moloch the killer , and all abandoned tanit
which has expressed , not only its literary and scholastic obsessions , but its vast , deep , universal movement ?
he said to a slave who stood writing in the hollow of his hand
in egypt he would have been taken for the temple ’ s god ; the middle ages thought he was its demon ; he was its soul
it ’ s the devil who made them in the image of his fork !
look at you weeping like a coward !
it sometimes happened that a solemn decree of parliament violated the asylum and delivered the condemned back to the executioner ; but that was rare
spendius urged them to give in
my lord , he said returning to the provost , which one am i to take ?
this tower was the most lively , and thus the most hideous , spot in the truanderie
to obey you i would go down through the cave of hadrumetum into the kingdom of the shades… forgive me !
in front and behind the grey ground sloped up , covered with stones speckled with occasional bits of lichen , and over their heads the continuously clear sky spread out , smoother and colder to the eye than a metal dome
now , clopin trouillefou went on , as soon as i clap my hands , andry-le-rouge , you push the stool over with your knee ; françois chante-prune , you hang on to the rogue ’ s feet ; and you , bellevigne , jump on his shoulders ; all at the same time , do you hear ?
his face was convulsed by unspeakable anguish , and he was choking as he held back his sobs , he wanted so much both to ask questions and cry mercy !
by his calling and by his character he had always kept away from women ; he seemed to hate them more than ever
it ’ s all spinning round in my head ! —i was reading
kings are like the cretan jupiter , they have ears only in their feet
this time the girl fell back once more , exhausted , broken , her eyes already glazed like someone in the grave
if only hanno had not arrived too late that morning at the aegates isles !
a mother tigress is not too particular about such details
moreover he was due to hold a sitting at the grand châtelet
the elders felt relieved of a great anxiety when he left carthage
all her women came behind her ; and at each step she took , they took one too
down with the mace-bearers !
what have you done !
a man was sitting in the armchair , bent over the table
is it true , father ?
his scouts came to tell him that a convoy had been sighted going towards the lead mountain
the crowbars raised the heavy stone course
down with the beadles !
however , ships had gone up the scythian rivers , penetrated into colchis , to the jugrians , to the estians , carried off virgins in the archipelago and sent to the bottom all foreign ships sailing past cape oestrymon , to prevent the secret of their courses being known
each section of this grotesque procession had its own particular music
her head rose clear of the crowd
the soldiers ’ blood ran cold
he deliberately tied the tongue which claude frollo had taken such pains to loosen
hamilcar , unable to speak , thanked her with nods of his head
saint hugh , an english bishop , allowed king edward to seize a magician in his church
it was so high that the red of the walls , as it rose nearer the ceiling , turned into black , and the idol ’ s three eyes appeared right at the top , like stars half hidden in the darkness
who ’ s that with you ?
… a woman ’ s name must be pleasing , sweet , imaginative ; it must end in long vowels , and resemble words of benediction
do you know why he followed you ?
how he stares at the little dancing girl !
little jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast
there were too the bones of dromedaries and mules
get up there , will you !
he snatched at his sword , threw it on the ground
meanwhile they could glimpse at an infinite depth below streets , marching soldiers , swaying swords : and the tumult of battle came to them vaguely , like the sound of the sea to shipwrecked sailors dying in a ship ’ s rigging
narr ’ havas was the finest of them all ; straps studded with pearls clasped his slim arms ; the golden circle which fastened his long garment round his head held an ostrich feather which hung down behind his shoulder ; a continual smile revealed his teeth ; his eyes seemed as sharp as arrows , and in all his person there was something alert and nimble
she had a he-goat with her , a big one , black or white , i forget now
anyone who has ever tossed a stone into a pond full of frogs or fired a gun at a flock of birds can imagine the effect of such unseemly words when the attention of all was fixed elsewhere
go back to carthage !
the king sprang outside and called his horsemen
as he could no longer sit , he remained lying by the door , half hidden in the fringes of the high tapestry ; and when the pontiff of moloch asked them if they would agree to giving up their children , his voice , suddenly , boomed out from the shadows like a genius bellowing from the depths of a cave
men bent over a windlass ; the great beam rose , became horizontal , rose up almost vertically , and , overloaded at the end , bent like a huge reed
the palais of the légion d ’ honneur is also a most distinguished piece of confectionery
the heavy surbased arches of monsieur de brosse , the clumsy architect of the portail saint-gervais , so much for art ; and as for history , we have the garrulous memories of the great pillar , still echoing with the patrus ’ gossip
with what thoughts did the unfortunate man wrestle ?
but they caught sight of a small lake , divided into a number of pools by blue stone walls
the orator delivered it with a marvellous range of actions
my name is tristan l ’ hermite and i ’ m the king ’ s compère
he looked up at the roof of the church
provided the priest had his basilica and his altar , he had no more say
the priest resumed his look of sombre gravity , made a sign to quasimodo , and silently withdrew
he returned to notre-dame , lit his lamp and climbed back up the tower
cried robin poussepain , throwing into his face a sponge that had been dragged through the gutter
when they were out of the last enclosure , they made for hamilcar ’ s palace , spendius realizing that it was no good attempting to divert mâtho from it
ashes of your sons and the ashes of your ancestors ’ brothers , with which i now mingle my own !
the boot , he said in the end
the good lord has restored her to me
why do they call you la esmeralda ?
even poor poetry , properly so-called , that which went on obstinately vegetating in manuscripts , found itself obliged , if it were to count for something , to become incorporated into the framework of the building in the form of hymn or prose sequence ; that after all was the role played by aeschylus ’ tragedies in the religious festivals of greece , by the book of genesis in solomon ’ s temple
suddenly a long arrow whistled , then another , and stones thudded : but the ill aimed shots ( for they were afraid of hitting the zaïmph ) passed over his head
i ’ m not talking about that , maître jacques charmolue , but about the case of your magician
the adventure had a touch of magic about it
streets emptied at his approach , and this torrent of men in flight burst up on either side up to the tops of the walls
a little further away there was a food-warmer , and a prie-dieu in crimson velvet , set off with small gold studs ; finally , at the far end , a simple bed of pink and yellow damask , with no tinsel or braid ; the fringes quite plain
these old pirates ploughed up the countryside , these profiteers fitted out ships , these landowners supported slaves who practised crafts
he was unable to conceal his delight , though he tried from time to time to compose himself
gringoire , who had not yet quite reached that state , half rose
hamilcar interrogated the chief of the ships
his harangue went on for seven hours
exclaimed gringoire , there ’ s a great king !
but three hours later a more extraordinary piece of news was circulating : the suffete had found springs at the foot of the cliff
do you know , oudarde , he ate all the cherries off the tree in our orchard at charlerange , all by himself
thus , having duly ruminated over quasimodo ’ s case , he threw back his head and half closed his eyes , to appear more majestic and impartial , with the result that at that moment he was at once deaf and blind—twin conditions without which no judge is perfect
hamilcar meanwhile was ranging over the eastern territories
i am teaching him to hurl javelins and drive teams of horses
what is certain is that they are gypsies
what was that inner fire which sometimes flashed in his eyes , so much so that they looked like holes pierced in a furnace wall ?
what difference does it make to you , your majesty , by whom every eye is dazzled , that there should be one more poor man on earth ?
he ran to it as to a star
taanach , with a smile like an old monkey ’ s grimace , went back to her task
that is indeed a frightful story , said oudarde , enough to make a burgundian weep !
at the sight of that ugly face appearing in the middle of her song , the girl broke off with an involuntary gesture of fright
she ’ s the gypsy with the goat
quasimodo , remaining on his own in the vastness of notre-dame , a moment before under such tumultuous siege , made his way back to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many weeks with him as her guard
mâtho the libyan leaned towards her
mâtho , as he walked ahead of her , drove them aside with a gesture of his arm which lifted his red cloak
and many people simply preferred to see them living , breathing , moving , jostling , in flesh and blood , in this flemish embassy , this episcopal court , in the cardinal ’ s robes , in coppenole ’ s jerkin , rather than painted and dressed up , speaking in verse and , so to speak , stuffed like dummies beneath the yellow and white tunics in which gringoire had rigged them up
it is a birch leaf , said maître jacques charmolue ; further evidence of magic
the child was not yet one year old
two men at once jumped on his back ; he leaped back against a door and crushed them
here and there a young man could be seen saying to a greybeard : no , no !
messieurs the sergeants , one word !
number sous number deniers parisis for wearing two sets of beads !
she repeated her question
first of all she said more than a year , observed the soldier
the man with the lantern walked straight to the tip of the terrain
whatever is without beauty is wrong to exist ,
and that all came from quasimodo
hamilcar ’ s return had not surprised the mercenaries ; as they saw it , this man could not die
daedalus is the foundations , orpheus the walls , hermes the building
on the peristyle of the temples the priests in despair were wringing their arms
there was obviously a great commotion going on inside the palace
it ’ s a spendid thing to die as one has lived
he had a sort of platform built of sacks and declared that he would not go before he had paid them all in full
do you know what it is to have a child ?
they had seen his eye blaze , his muscles tense , his limbs gather themselves , and the straps and chains stretch
and the crowd applauded even louder
the vertical section of this kennel , as phoebus had so aptly described it , would have made a triangle
i have not crawled on my belly for so long with my nails in the earth through the cavern ’ s countless ramifications without glimpsing far ahead , at the end of the dark tunnel , a light , a flame , something , no doubt a reflection from the dazzling central laboratory where wise and patient men have caught god unawares
there are indeed some quite superb high-warp tapestries there
and ate her with their teeth
these places of asylum , amid the deluge of penal laws and barbaric jurisdictions which flooded the city , were like islands rising above the level of human justice
how innocent she is , that poor la herme !
hippocrates , a dream , urania , a dream , hermes , an idea
she turned round , begging him with a smile : please leave me alone , phoebus !
you demanded horses , women , land , judicial office , no doubt , and priesthood !
comrade , is there any reason , because you bored us this morning , for not hanging you this evening ?
then he began to run over the platform from end to end – and like a charioteer triumphing in the olympic games , spendius , exultant with pride , lifted up his arms
it was a large dogheaded ape , one of those which lived freely in the goddess ’ s enclosure
that did not stop quasimodo reappearing from time to time those first few days
he kept seeing , prowling ceaselessly around the church , sinister-looking men who never took their eyes off the girl ’ s place of refuge
he dismounted from his horse ; and spurring it on the rump with the sword in his hand sent it into the barbarians
several people fainted ; others became inert and petrified in their ecstasy
she nodded assent and said : yes
and leaning over the balcony balustrade he began shouting : little girl !
the court of miracles lay in total darkness
he went on still louder : mademoiselle esmeralda !
but then came the crusades
it is certain that if ravaillac had not assassinated henri iv there would have been no documents from ravaillac ’ s trial to be deposited in the registry of the palais de justice ; no accomplices with an interest in making the said documents disappear ; hence no arsonists obliged , for want of any better method , to burn down the registry in order to burn the documents and to burn down the palais de justice in order to burn the registry ; in short , therefore , no great fire in number the old palais would still be standing with its old great hall ; i could say to the reader go and see it ’ , and we should both be spared the trouble , i of composing , he of reading , any detailed description of it
it occurred to her that someone might hear ; so she fell silent
then he said : i don ’ t know
but something drove him to plunge deeper into his misfortune ; and seized with a frenzy of inquiry he inspected under the sheds , behind the warehouse , the stocks of pitch , timber , anchors , and ropes , of honey and wax , the reserves of food , the marble workshop , the silphium store
and she called them by their names , the names of the months :
cried the amorous captain
only utica and hippo-zarytus had not betrayed them ; but hamilcar surrounded these two cities
some of them prayed , turning towards different constellations
the old woman was la falourdel ; the girl a common whore ; the young man , his young brother jehan
are you going to… ?
the human heart can not long remain at an extreme
this damage , less than the rest , had annoyed him ; for in spite of his efforts to put them out of his mind , he kept coming upon the barbarians
at this the venerable lady stood up and went to the window
he rose to his feet , threw the palliasse back at the urchins and fled
the memory of this fresh meat was very painful on the following days
the front part of the hall was occupied by the public ; to left and right were lawyers sitting at tables ; at the back , on a dais , numerous judges , their back rows buried in the shadows : sinister faces without movement
but a people existed which was always ready to use bravery ; the thief expelled from his tribe , the parricide wandering aimlessly , the sacrilegious man pursued by the gods , all the hungry , the desperate tried to reach the port where the carthaginian agent was recruiting soldiers
as for me , i come expecting to see faces and see nothing but backs !
he shouted ; the slave-master fled
spendius climbed up on to their frame
on the chair he had tied a cat , lent by a woman nearby , which was swearing with terror
the suffete soon calculated whether the sums present corresponded with the profits and losses he had just been told ; and he was leaving when he caught sight of three bronze jars completely empty
he looked for some phrase , a way round
i was fully hoping to lay you out in the gutter and still arrive in time for the lady , all the more so , as it ’ s good form to keep a woman waiting a bit in such cases
that is , the whole
and then , in this matter , did not appearances tell much more against her than against him ?
perhaps i would have given it up , perhaps my hideous idea would have withered in my brain without bearing fruit
and tearing open his tunic , he revealed a back covered with bloody sores ; he was a labourer from hippo-zarytus
she could not help smiling
their hearts could not stand seeing them again
mâtho tried to stupefy himself with wine
salammbo then appeared on the platform of her terrace
you ’ ll come along with us
whereas i carry my dungeon within me , within me is winter , ice , despair
every country has its st peter ’ s , rome
the aqueduct of which he spoke crossed the whole isthmus at an angle – a considerable work later enlarged by the romans
the flames of the candelabra , at a level below his sandals , flickered at the movement from his cloak and his steps threw up a fine dust which hung all around him , waist-high
meanwhile they were waiting for an ambassador from carthage , who was to bring them on mule-back baskets laden with gold ; and constantly repeating the same sum , they drew figures on the sand with their fingers
the suffete will escape us !
on the platform of the aqueduct guards of the legion were posted as sentries ; and by them , at intervals , stood bronze vats in which boiled quantities of pitch
however , if you are driven by a desire to put yourself to school at your age and decipher the fearsome alphabet of the sages , come to me , all right , i ’ ll try
hamilcar did not answer but clapped his hands ; three men appeared ; and all four together , straining their arms , pulled from its sockets the enormous bar closing the door
the cathedral was already dark and deserted
you should have waited all night !
a good many knights were killed there by knaves ; and monsieur de château-guyon , the greatest lord in burgundy , was found dead with his great grey horse in a little marshy field
the military harbour was completely separated from the city ; when ambassadors arrived , they had to pass between two walls , into a corridor which came out on the left , in front of khamon ’ s temple
moloch ’ s servants were becoming impatient
he pushed the door : it opened
i know that i need money , jehan repeated for the third time
then a negro ( the same one who carried his parasol in battle ) leaned over to his ear
sometimes horrible barks rose up and the man did not come back
for anyone who knows how to read it , heraldry is an algebra , a language
each of them had been given a gold piece , on condition that they went to camp out at sicca , and they had been told in the most flattering way :
several partitions , planks , and trapdoors made for the lions ’ enclosure near saint-paul—number livres
authority tottered , unity was split
it was like some gigantic stone chessboard
that always happens here , at noon
the sixteenth century shattered religious unity
the elephants , frightened by these flames , took flight
it was more than a chain , more than a shackle , more than an iron ring : it was living , intelligent pincers emerging from a wall
i followed the trail of your fires as if i were walking behind moloch !
coppenole went on , most unhappy at being thus obliged to lower his voice , i feel a great itch to sit on the floor , legs crossed like a hosier , as i do in my own shop
here and there heaps of corn were spread out ; elsewhere rusty barley was dropping
the people made no mistake about it either ; for anyone with a little sense quasimodo was the demon , claude frollo the sorcerer
the mere rustle of a silk petticoat brought his hood down over his eyes
what can i do for you , mademoiselle ?
gringoire was frightened by his expression
sacks of wheat could be seen strewn around in the open store-houses , and under the gate a dense line of wagons piled high by the barbarians : peacocks roosting in the cedars spread out their tails and began to screech
in my time they would have been thrashed with a big stick and then burned with it
clumps of trees spiked out against the long lines of the walls
gradually these hallucinations were succeeded by a vision less distraught and less exaggerating
pride will destroy you , compère
those who had no arms ran off into the woods to cut themselves sticks
on his return to the cloister the archdeacon found waiting at the door of his cell his brother jehan du moulin , who had been whiling away his boredom while he waited by making a charcoal sketch on the wall of his older brother ’ s profile enhanced by an outsize nose
that , with a grimy skullcap which barely let a single hair show , was all that could be made out of the person seated
for the abbey of saint-antoine-des-champs , said fleur-de-lys without looking up
that ’ s different , replied the king
it seems , said gringoire , that this one talks too ; but it ’ s a harsh tongue , and he is more fortunate than i if he understands it
he was reserving her for some match that might serve him politically , with the result that salammbo lived alone in the midst of this palace ; her mother was long since dead
but jehan maintained his right and was first to put his foot on the rungs
in winter i ’ d warm myself in the sun , under the porch of the hôtel de sens , and i thought it quite absurd that the great bonfire on midsummer ’ s eve should be kept for the dog-days
he ’ s a lucky painter , that jehan fourbault !
then they groaned ; some quietly wept , like small children
sometimes two men stopped , streaming with blood , fell into each other ’ s arms and died kissing
he had never before commanded in such enterprises
, it did not prevent the archdeacon being regarded by the learned heads in the chapter as a soul who had ventured into the antechamber of hell , lost in the caverns of the kabbala , groping in the darkness of the occult sciences
the sight opened up again the lacerating injuries inflicted on his self-esteem : he fled
and he boasted of knowing the right things to say to save the army
those of megara were the strongest in carthage
salammbo repeated in a dream
she had shown as much more than once in front of quasimodo
the egyptian girl had better look out !
her provisions were replenished by an invisible hand while she was asleep
quasimodo seemed to feel some of the same modesty
quasimodo vibrated with the bell
the crowd was so compact , the dust so thick , the din so loud , that it was impossible to distinguish things ; the cowards who offered to surrender were not even heard
then he raised his eyes and looked at tanit , whose slender crescent shone in the sky , and he felt stronger than the baals and full of scorn for them
this inertia concealed skilful moves
you know , monsieur jehan , that our fief of tirechappe brings in only , taking altogether the quit-rents and income from the twenty-one houses , number livres number sols number deniers parisis
cry , blaspheme , ravage , and slay
the lines of soldiers marching along below them made ripples in the dark
cried people on every side
he declared that he had come to join the mercenaries , for the republic had long since been threatening his kingdom
there was no trace of the baby left , except for one of her pretty little shoes
but the girl , perhaps somewhat wary , remembering the violent attempt of the night before , withdrew her hand with the frightened gesture of a child afraid of being bitten by an animal
when her daughter was inside the cell , she gently laid her on the ground , then picked her up again , and carrying her in her arms as though she was still the baby agnès , walked up and down in the harrow cell , intoxicated , out of her mind with joy , shouting , singing , kissing her daughter , talking to her , roaring with laughter , bursting into tears , all at the same time , in a frenzy
he continued to flee for as long as he could see , when he turned his head , the ring of the university ’ s towers and the scattered houses of the suburbs , but when at last a fold in the ground completely hid that hateful paris from his sight , when he could feel that he was a hundred leagues away , in the country , in a desert , he stopped and seemed able to breathe again
to allay the need they put on their tongues the metal scales of their belts , ivory pommels , sword blades
so he had gone back to his tent , thrown off his breastplate and put on his lion-skin , more suitable for battle
i tried once , said gringoire , scratching his ear
spendius was astounded at such an air of authority
i assure you that we were all weeping too
students talking like that to a respectable citizen !
even women contributed ; payment was made on behalf of children , and , something monstrous by carthaginian standards , he forced the priestly colleges to provide money
said the philosopher each time he just missed falling ; it ’ s often our best friends who cause our downfall !
you see , they are after you , and i ’ m not lying
there was saint-gervais , since spoiled by a doorway in good taste ’ ; saint-méry , whose old gothic arches were still almost round romanesque ones ; saint-jean , whose magnificent spire was a byword ; there were a score of other monuments which did not disdain to bury their marvels amid this chaos of dark , narrow , cavernous streets
i am studying the way these stones have been cut , and the undercutting of this bas-relief
from every path they poured forth endlessly , like streams rushing into a lake
at each step mâtho expected to die
the ugly monkey , said one
in number we made you groom of the bedchamber ; in number warden of the castle of the bridge of saint-cloud at a salary of number livres tournois ( you wanted livres parisis )
then she walked up and down , irked at the time still left
it ’ s an egg , with another devil , just like him , inside , with another little egg containing another devil and so on
until then , take me !
mâtho quickly paid the mercenaries their back pay , and this idea of spendius ’ won him appointment as general in chief , schalischim of the barbarians
i should be seen… but i have probably not brought enough chains ?
and splitting these three series into two , you will find in the three elder sisters , hindu , egyptian , and romanesque architecture , the same symbol : namely theocracy , caste , unity , dogma , myth , god ; and in the three younger sisters , phoenician , greek , and gothic architecture , whatever diversity of form may be inherent in their nature , there is also the same significance : freedom , the people , man
in the egyptian east poetry has the same grandeur and tranquillity of line as the buildings ; in ancient greece beauty , serenity , calm ; in christian europe the majesty of catholicism , the simplicity of the people , the rich , luxuriant vegetation of an age of renewal
a rampart of turf enclosed the army in a high wall , unshakeable by catapult fire
everyone took something from the pile , one a helmet , another a rapier , a third a misericord , a dagger with a cross-shaped hilt
that will be fun for us
it would certainly be unfair and in poor taste to boo a cardinal for keeping everyone waiting at the show , when he is a fine-looking man and wears his red robe so well
his unhappy voice was indeed drowned by the din going on around him
said the captain , getting them to tighten quasimodo ’ s bonds , i ’ d rather have kept the wench
the drizzle falling on the corpses softened them , and soon turned the whole plain into a large rotting pile
oh yes… yes… master !
maître coppenole , struck with wonder , approached him
some had been dead for so long that nothing remained on the wood but the remnants of their skeletons ; others half eaten away had their faces contorted in hideous grimaces ; some of them were enormous , the tree of the cross bent beneath them and they swayed in the wind , while flocks of crows wheeled ceaselessly above their heads
djali , how does maître guichard grand-rémy , captain of the municipal pistoleers , behave in the candlemas procession ?
suddenly she began singing in a scarcely articulate voice :
hamilcar impassively picked up the tablets ; and his lips parted and his eyes widened when he saw , for a single day ’ s expenditure , an exorbitant consumption of meat , fish , birds , wines , and spices , with dishes broken , slaves dead , and carpets lost
and for a haudriette ’ s child ?
that ’ s not such a very unusual story , said gervaise , and i don ’ t see anything in it to do with gypsies or children
the mob repeated with a frenzied cheer
he , for his part , noticed nothing in the hall ; he kept nodding his head , as unconcerned as any neapolitan , repeating from time to time , amid the general noise , as if from mechanical habit : charity , please !
he tried to invent fearful machines such as had never been built before
but you are brave , they will obey you
these people with their peaceful occupations met every outrage with bent head and attempted smiles
reverend sir , replied compère tourangeau , i am a sick man , very sick
in their fury the carthaginians began to sack the provinces ; they filled in water-tanks ; burned houses
well , mahiette went on , i call her paquette la chantefleurie
i ’ m a poor harlot
what hungarian jewish lingo are you singing now ?
good-night , madame the electress !
the blades fell on the exact target , then were jerked up again , with a limb following
then it curled up gracefully over its mistress ’ s feet , inviting a word or a caress : but the accused stayed motionless , and poor djali herself was spared not a glance
good-day , monsieur the elector !
now , how precarious is the immortality of a manuscript !
kyrie eleison , said the priests who had remained beneath the arched doorway
as a punishment they had been required to pay , talents , , oxen , bags of gold dust , considerable advances of grain , and the tribal chiefs had been crucified or thrown to the lions
hanno gesticulated with his spatula ; those who tried to silence the others by shouting louder added to the din
said salammbo , and stiffening against herself , she suddenly revived
that is how the soldiers of african race thought
in the suffete ’ s garden , i was the one who pushed the gaul !
so the suffete ’ s stratagem had worked
the terrace was now so laden with corpses that it might have been built of human bodies
i tell you , it ’ s the gypsy women who stole her from me , do you hear ?
don ’ t turn your head away like that
at night , when all the rest of the beggars ’ realm was asleep , when not one window in the grubby façades of the square remained lit , when there was not a cry to be heard from the hundreds of households , those swarms of thieves , harlots , and stolen or bastard children , the pleasure tower could always be identified by the noise coming from it and from the scarlet glare which , radiating at once from air-vents , windows , and fissures in the cracked walls , leaked out , so to speak , from all its pores
he talks to that creature in her own language !
phoebus exclaimed : a purse in your pocket , jehan , is like the moon in a bucket of water
she stammered , you are looking for your child
two thousand young men carried slings , a dagger , and sandals
i am the author … ’
was it to betray them , or perhaps the republic ?
quasimodo was no more affected by it than if it had scratched king pharamond
saint michael the archangel , as the paternoster puts it
the bed-curtains , hanging straight down , enveloped her in a bluish penumbra , and as she breathed , the movement stirred the cords so that she seemed to sway in the air
the old suffete hesitated for a few minutes between his rancour and appetite for authority
something rather similar to faust ’ s cell presented itself to jehan ’ s eyes when he ventured to put his head round the half-open door
one morning , she saw , as she awoke , two vases filled with flowers on her window
the river , water ruffling against the arches of so many bridges , the tips of so many islands , was all a-shimmer with silvery pleats
he supported his opinion , and he even blamed the libyan for wanting to abandon their project out of excessive courage
now all this multitude had been waiting since morning
then on the following days , while she let the conviction grow upon her that she was more disposed to help tanit , the python was cured , grew fatter , seemed to revive
then he straightened up
they were marching side by side , to the right of the army , on the side of a hill ; the plain stretched out below , hidden in the mist of the night
said the king , gripping the arms of his chair with both hands , i knew i had come here to the bastille for something
nudus vinctus , centum pondo , es quando pendes per pedes
the lions in moloch ’ s temple had become enraged , and the temple slaves no longer dared approach them
dom claude went on with a disdainful smile
he paled in dismay
with scythes , pikes , hackbuts , picks
she was indeed quite simply a gypsy
cried the poor girl , on the contrary , i need air
i remember there was a lot of laughter because next to amanyon de garlande , who was very short , was sir matefelon , a knight of gigantic stature , who had killed heaps of englishmen
dead drunk , jehan went on
at length the torturer stamped his foot
they will rise up at a word
a mass can be demolished , but how can ubiquity be eradicated ?
that was something very fine and savage
my pretty little daughter !
why , the mystery , said gringoire
to the southeast the montagne sainte-genèvieve formed an immense bulge , and it was a sight to see from the top of notre-dame that throng of narrow winding streets ( the latin quarter of today ) , those clusters of houses , spread out in all directions from the summit of that eminence , tumbling in disorder , almost vertically , down its slopes to the water ’ s edge , looking as if some were falling and others climbing back again , all holding on to each other
no , sire , there ’ s a mistake
fury made these savage faces gleam ; their grubby foreheads streamed with sweat ; their eyes flashed
then again from time to time this mass of sublime sounds leaves an opening through which comes the stretta of the ave-maria , bursting and sparkling like a plume of stars
the truands , with whom he had remained , judging that in the last analysis they offered the best company in paris , the truands had continued to take an interest in the gypsy girl
he ’ ll pay for it , by god !
there is no reason why one deaf man talking to another should ever stop
besides , the stones that hit him explained the laughter
mâtho cried out an order : all the shields fell back on the helmets : he jumped on them , seeking a foothold somewhere to re-enter carthage : and , brandishing his terrible axe , he ran over the shields , like so many bronze waves , as a sea god might run over the water shaking his trident
in that case , according to epicurius [ sic ] , i lack some-thing or other made of something else that has no name
she passed her head through the window bars , and managed to see into the corner on which the unfortunate woman ’ s eyes were invariably fixed
next mâtho divided the army into large semicircles , so as to envelop carthage more effectively
children from the petits-carreaux
i have dark night in my soul
meanwhile there could be heard in the background a great noise of marching feet , dominated by the shrill notes of trumpets being blown furiously
in his ring-laden fingers he held a jet necklace to recognize men liable to scrofula
they all greeted each other with close embraces
as he said that he glanced at the silver goblet sparkling on the table
but in the arid desert of his life salammbo was like a flower growing from a crack in a tomb
he attached a sort of harpoon to the end of a cord , whirled it round rapidly like a sling , the iron device caught ; and they began , one behind the other , to climb along the wall
it ’ s a real shame that man is looking at her like that , added amelotte de montmichel , she ’ s a marvellous dancer
tunicam dechiraverunt says the complaint
the fact is … duty … and , besides , charming cousin , i have been ill
however they respected their stronger sister , who protected them , and they did not believe that a horde of barbarians was capable of beating her ; on the contrary , they would be exterminated
it ’ s a lovely sunny day
the warmth of the room had misted over the glass front , but through it could be seen scores of hazy figures milling about , and breaking out now and then with a burst of resounding laughter
it was really him
everything lay still in extraordinary silence and exhaustion
in his palace at night , as he could not sleep , in preparation for battle he shouted out combat commands in a terrible voice
god will cough some latin in her face !
but why doesn ’ t your friend speak ?
the soldiers lit up their way with torches , but still stumbled over the sloping ground , which had been deeply ploughed
they were blamed for all the mercenaries ’ crimes : their gluttony , their thefts , their impiety , their scorn , and the death of the fish in salammbo ’ s garden
twelve hundred of the deserters survived , the suffete made them all captains ; and carpenters , armourers , blacksmiths , and goldsmiths were put in charge of machines
the washerwomen made a lot of noise there , shouting , talking , singing from morning to night along the water ’ s edge , and banging away at their washing as they do today
from the height where he stood , claude frollo could not make out his features
cried phoebus , and roughly shoved the drunken student , who slid down the wall and fell limply on philip-augustus ’ s paving-stones
it is likely that this strange procession , which seemed so keen to conceal itself in profound darkness , was observing an equally profound silence
then they all stopped
the child is still asleep
he knew where to find the key of the red door connecting the cloister to the church , and he always had on him , as we know , a key to the tower staircase
this marc cenaine is an ignoramus !
i ’ m going to decide your life ; you , my soul
round the circular slab on which his feet rested , the children , swathed in black veils , formed a motionless circle ; and his disproportionately long arms stretched their palms down to them , as if to seize this crown and bear it up to heaven
everyone played his own game , with comments and oaths , paying no heed to his neighbour
others as well as he missed their homeland , although it was not so far away
this bohemian law , weird though it may seem to the reader , is still today written down in full in the old english statute books
i ’ ll go and bring him to you , he said in a faint voice
beyond the tournelles , and up as far as charles v ’ s wall , stretched a velvety carpet of gardens and royal parks , with rich compartments of greenery and flowers , in the midst of which could be identified , from its labyrinth of trees and paths , the famous daedalus garden which louis xi had given to coictier
she said countless other extravagant things to her , to which the tone alone lent beauty , disarranged the poor girl ’ s clothing to the point of making her blush , smoothed out her silken hair with her hand , kissed her foot , her knee , her forehead , her eyes , went into raptures about everything
their wet sandals made no noise : spendius , with eyes brighter than torches , searched the bushes at every step – and he walked behind mâtho , hands upon the two daggers which he carried on his arms , fastened below the armpits with a leather band
the question , i don ’ t mind
he had first made his money by selling women ; then , ruined by a shipwreck , he had fought with the samnite shepherds against the romans
i would like to sell myself and become her slave
undoubtedly a vague , indeterminate desire to please the handsome officer animated them one and all , his splendid uniform was the target for all their coquetry , and ever since he had been there , there had been a certain secret rivalry between them , which they scarcely admitted even to themselves , but which was none the less continually manifested in their gestures and words
with the sudden pounce of the spider which we saw hurling itself on the fly when its web was shaken , she rushed to the window which , as we know , looked out on to the place de grève
they were all versed in religious disciplines , skilled in stratagems , ruthless and rich
spendius struck his hand against the bars of a grill
on each of its concentric enclosures the priests could read the word translated and made manifest to the eye , and could thus follow its transformations from sanctuary to sanctuary until in the final tabernacle they grasped it in its most concrete form , which was still architectural : the ark
he said sorrowfully , i beg you , go on and don ’ t send me away
each of them held on her knees a section of a great needlework tapestry , on which they were working together , while a goodly length of it trailed over the matting covering the floor
then all of them , with cries like ravenous beasts rushed upon the flour , and devoured it , burying their faces in the heaps
yes , master , and fearless too !
here the priest stopped , and the prisoner heard rending sighs come from his chest like a death-rattle
to demolish the constructed word it takes a social , a terrestrial revolution
just a moment , gervaise !
i ’ d swear it on my father ’ s head too , for the two things are connected in more than one way
gringoire answered enthusiastically : upon my honour , yes !
no one in carthage knew as much as he did
perfumes , flowers , pieces of silver were showered on them
if we had been fortunate enough to invent this most truthful story and consequently to have to answer for it before our lady of criticism , we could not at this moment be charged with the classical precept : ne deus intersit [ let there be no divine intervention ]
he was indeed everywhere , multiplying himself to be at every point in the monument at once
mercy ! —i had never realized as i do now how much i loved you—oh !
from the bleary gallows ,
being something of an armourer , i worked on that great bombard of jean maugue , which , as you know , burst on the pont de charenton the day they tried it out , and killed twenty-four spectators
i hear your voice in the clashing of cymbals !
we get together a crowd , like here
a shower of fat crackled in the dripping pan , filling up with its constant sputtering the gaps in the hundreds of dialogues going on across the room from one end to the other
paquette would never part with it , however great her need
there was no other sound in the boat but the oars going in and out , mingled with the constant rippling of the water against the sides
here the priest looked directly at the prisoner and added coldly :
so the gypsy women had not eaten her !
he had a cloak pulled up to his nose
he knows what he hasn ’ t got
there , at the very edge of the water , were the decaying remains of a fence made of stakes with laths laid across them to which a low vine clung with a few meagre branches sticking out like the fingers of an open hand
as for ships chartered in common , as the cargoes have often had to be thrown overboard , the unequal losses have been shared out per head of those associated
besides , as still happens today , the public was much more interested in the costumes worn by the actors than in the part they were reciting ; and indeed this was only right
and running his eyes over the missive , punctuating his reading with interjections : to be sure !
all , except the king , had their heads uncovered
tiratha ! … by the hidden symbols – by the sounding lutes – by the furrows of the earth – by the eternal silence and by the eternal fecundity – ruler of the dark sea and the azure shores , o queen of all things moist , greetings !
around the tribune , where quiet and dignity prevail , below , in front , everywhere , a great crowd and a great buzz of noise
cut these rogues down !
soon the blood spurted , and could be seen trickling in countless streams over the hunchback ’ s black shoulders , and the slender thongs as they whirled slashing through the air sprinkled drops of it over the crowd
it is killing me !
a tumbril , drawn by a powerful norman horse , and completely surrounded by cavalry in violet uniform with white crosses , had just come out on to the place from the rue saint-pierre-aux-bœufs
i ’ ll learn gratian off by heart , i ’ ll really believe in god , i ’ ll be a proper pythagoras of science and virtue
a man who had neither the dress nor the bearing of the soldiers stepped out of their ranks
phoebus , who as far as beauty was concerned had seen nothing since the cowherds of queue-en-brie , was intoxicated by fleur-de-lys , which made our officer so gallant and attentive that his peace was made straight away
she replied in broken tones : i have already said , i don ’ t know
so , one fine morning , feeling better , he had left his golden spurs as payment for the pharmacopolist , and made himself scarce
muttered gringoire , the king of this place must be a he-goat
she looked at him like an idiot
it went straight to the point , and you could see at once , at the end of every path , without the complication of undergrowth or sidetrack , the wheel , the gibbet , or the pillory
the roman people threatened the republic with immediate hostility unless it paid talents and the whole island of sardinia
in fact the carthaginians had fallen back behind the bridge , and to deceive the barbarians the suffete had established numerous posts on the other bank
quasimodo walked in front of him , scattering the crowd as he went along
hippo-zarytus did not listen to his summons , nor to those of the barbarians ; but every morning the inhabitants lowered baskets of food to them and cried down from the towers , making the republic ’ s demands their excuse and begging them to go away
a sorceress had bewitched bruno of asti , he had her burned and was cured
young girl , the pine tree is not beautiful ,
mâtho sprang on to the horse which the slave held by the door
well then , he said , i am not yet as successful in cupid as i thought
the moment was critical
what is it to me ?
and when the legate went by , you know , gisquette , they launched their assault and all the english had their throats cut !
the rues saint-denis and saint-martin , with their countless ramifications , rose side by side like two great trees mingling their branches
come now , said gervaise , feeling charitable in her turn , and undoing her woollen smock , here ’ s a coat that ’ s a bit warmer than yours
even in this extremity she saw him stare at her nakedness with an eye glittering with lust , jealousy , and desire
this strange creature , unhappy though the gypsy ’ s plight was , still aroused in her a feeling of compassion
it was , they thought , a way of hiding the inadequacy of his troops
there was another moment when , while laughing diabolically at himself , he simultaneously pictured esmeralda as he had first seen her , lively , carefree , joyful , all dressed up , dancing , winged , harmonious , and the esmeralda of her last day , in a shift , the rope round her neck , slowly climbing , barefoot , the sharp steps up to the gibbet ; this double image was so vivid that he let out a terrible cry
he suddenly asked himself
they express a nuance of the art which would be lost without them , that is to say the grafting of the pointed on to the round arch
and how fortunate you are to be a man , you wicked young libertine !
between their squadrons , young men , wearing small helmets , weighed an ash-wood spear in each hand ; the long pikes of the heavy infantry brought up the rear
but there was not time , or money , to acquire other mercenaries
bands kept arriving in large numbers
i ’ ll speak to him !
at that moment the sound of footsteps came from the stairs
since then , on all his visits to the gondelaurier mansion , he had been very careful to make no further mention of that woman , whose memory , after all , was a painful one for him ; and for her part fleur-de-lys had not judged it politic to tell him that the gypsy girl was still alive
to the rear of the gaps between them could be seen the cohorts of the light infantry , beyond them the great helmets of the clibanarii , with swords flashing in the sun , breastplates , plumes , waving banners
he pushed them away ; they were cyrenians of scandalous morals , but prized because of their secrets
quasimodo staggered in his bonds
the devil if i understand you !
their hooded heads could be seen in the shadows being uncovered one after the other as the president put the lugubrious question to them in a low voice
a troop of riders could be heard from over there
la buona mancia , signor !
in fact , from the origin of things up to the fifteenth century of the christian era inclusive , architecture was the great book of mankind , the principal expression of man at his different stages of development , whether as strength or as intelligence
he leaned over to his neighbour , the abbot of sainte-geneviève , and said in an undertone : monsieur the archduke has sent us a fine lot of ambassadors to herald madame marguerite !
the truande replied , turning her back on him
( it is true that sauval had not yet measured the great hall of the castle at montargis )
now and then you can see passing by sounds of every shape emanating from the triple peal of saint-germain-des-prés
but the gold dust from his hair had fallen on to his shoulders , where it shone in two bright patches , while his hair looked white , fine and curly as wool
her voice swelled , her cheeks flushed crimson
he was simultaneously gripped by a nobler affection and devoured by a keener desire
deaf quasimodo looked at her
the captains , in their bronze buskins , had occupied the central path , under a purple , gold-fringed awning , which stretched from the stable wall to the first terrace of the palace ; the bulk of the soldiers were spread out under the trees , where numerous flat-roofed buildings could be seen , presses , cellars , stores , bakeries , and arsenals , with a yard for the elephants , pits for the wild beasts , a prison for the slaves
these pillars were arranged in such a way as to reproduce in their circular rows , one inside another , the saturnian period containing the years , the years the months , the months the days , and finally met against the wall of the sanctuary
the white light seemed to envelop her like a silver mist , her wet footprints glistened on the floor , stars shimmered in the depths of the water ; it tightened round her its black coils striped with golden patches
greetings , eye of the baals , eternal glory !
it follows that we have both remained very virtuous
there were some mighty blows , and those who survived spoke of them long afterwards
but spendius calmed him down , and mâtho let himself be directed by the slave – always irresolute and incurably apathetic , like someone who has taken some draught from which he must die
his knees gave way from under him , and he collapsed on the pavement , thinking of her who had died that day
the carthaginians ’ teeth fell out of their mouths , and their gums became discoloured like those of camels after too long a journey
finally , it is certain that the archdeacon had fitted out for himself , in that one of the two towers that overlooks the grève , right beside the bell cage , a very secret little cell which no one , not even the bishop , so it was said , could enter without his leave
i ’ ll be reading my breviary the while
as he uttered those monstrous words , he assumed the air of ajax , expecting to see a thunderbolt come down on his head
in witness thereof i hereby set up my banner , and may god keep you , bishop of paris
the immense multitude seemed to be forming itself into a column
she was like a dead person holding in reserve a key to her tomb
to make him stay quiet salammbo tried to frighten him with lamia , an ogress of cyrene
distant tocsins sounded their plaints
who is singing that song ?
solomon ’ s temple , for instance , was not simply the binding of the sacred book , it was the sacred book itself
the tone in which she uttered that word made even henriet cousin shudder
perhaps he really did see hell beyond
answered the nameless one
they answered with a burst of sinister laughter
it was the voice of the slaves in the ergastulum
but knowing her to be alive , and phoebus too , meant the tortures beginning again , the shocks , the alternatives , life itself
old woman , said the provost in a stern tone , hand over that girl to us without any fuss
it is true that ravaillac may quite possibly have had no accomplices , and then that his accomplices , if perchance he had any , had nothing to do with the fire of number there are two other , quite plausible explanations for it
abdalonim hesitated , surprised at such generosity
he had smashed down the door and was there
at last they reached cape hermaeum , where ships came to pick them up
but as it rose , so the rampart also grew higher ; what was knocked down by one side was almost immediately rebuilt by the other
well now , monsieur , said gringoire , what are all these good people doing here ?
… something awful , oudarde !
or say they do ! —and supposing by chance she looks like you , with your screech-owl face ? —tell the one who sent you that i ’ m about to get married , and she can go to the devil !
i do not know , said spendius
if you were willing !
an enormous cedar occupied the middle of it
where did he get that broad , bare forehead , that head always bent forward , that chest always heaving with sighs ?
he allotted punishments with reproaches to giddenem ; and giddenem , like a bull , bowed his low forehead , where the broad eyebrows met
such was the room known as : the private retreat where monsieur louis of france says his hours ’
the mystery , and to hell with the flemings !
under clumps of turpentine-trees could be seen little buildings of varying shapes
his deputies for civil , criminal , and private cases were doing his job for him , as was customary , and since eight o ’ clock in the morning some scores of townsfolk , men and women , packed and squashed in a dark corner of the lower court of the châtelet , between a stout oak barrier and the wall , had been blissfully looking at the varied and delightful spectacle of civil and criminal justice being dispensed by maître florian barbedienne , auditor at the châtelet , deputy to monsieur the provost , a little confusedly and quite at random
hamilcar looked at giddenem ; he wanted to strangle him
suddenly , as they were all grouping together round the battering ram for a final effort , each man holding his breath and flexing his muscles so as to lend his whole strength to the decisive blow , a screaming even more awful than that which had broken out and then expired beneath the beam , went up from their midst
exclaimed salammbo , you will never wipe out what is irreparable !
they dragged him off
perhaps the others are stronger ?
he had kept all the pain for himself
scoundrel , were you not apprehended by the watch in that bad companty ?
meanwhile the curve of the carthaginians gradually flattened out , it became straight , then bent in ; thereupon the two sections of the velites came closer together in parallel , like the arms of a compass closing
the muzzle fitted on to his head so that his face was surrounded by a row of teeth ; the two forepaws crossed on his chest , and the hind paws hung down with their claws below his knees
monsieur , gringoire asked one of his neighbours , who are all those people sitting in rows over there like prelates at a conclave ?
the continuous babble of voices was dominated by the cry of the water carriers sprinkling the streets ; hamilcar ’ s slaves offered in his name toasted barley and bits of raw meat ; people came up to each other , kissed and wept ; the tyrian towns had been taken , the nomads scattered , all the barbarians destroyed
so , gringoire , you have never felt envious of those handsome lads in their military actons ?
people looked like corpses as they slept
so here i am then in actor ’ s garb , like saint genestus
i must explain that my house has a ground floor and one above ; at the back it looks out on to the river , like the other houses on the bridge , and the window on the ground floor and the one on the upper floor open on to the water
for making a great new wooden cage with big joists , ribs and string-pieces , number feet long by number feet broad , number feet high between the boards , smoothed and bolted with large iron bolts , which has been installed in a room , belonging to one of the towers of the fortress of saint-antoine , in the which cage is kept and detained , by command of our lord the king , a prisoner who lived previously in an old , worn-out and decrepit cage—in the making of the said new cage there have been used number horizontal joists and number upright ones , number string pieces number wises long ; and number carpenters have been employed in squaring , working , and shaping all the aforesaid wood in the yard of the bastille for twenty days … ’
and from now on , if architecture should accidentally revive , it will no longer be sovereign
what kind of heart is mine !
many carthaginians had wanted to accompany him ; they were important men and all of the war party
all the servants ran up
its ribs stuck out , one by one , beneath the taut skin ; its hind legs , nailed one on top of the other , rose a little ; and black blood , flowing through the hair , had collected in stalactites at the bottom of its tail , which hung straight down along the cross
he himself led tristan l ’ hermite to all the possible hiding places , opened secret doors for him , false altar backs , inner sacristies
hamilcar turned on his heel
all these details , here exposed for the reader ’ s edification , were so submerged in the general tumult as to be lost before they reached the reserved tribune
but not daring to compromise themselves , they answered with vague words , compliments and excuses
by the time the eighteenth century draws to its close the printing press has destroyed everything
the pretty embroidered shoe is now just an instrument of torture everlastingly crushing the mother ’ s heart
either from exhaustion or despair , she let him do it
meanwhile rumours of war had gone beyond the bounds of the punic empire ; and from the pillars of hercules to beyond cyrene shepherds dreamed about it as they guarded their flocks , and they talked about it at night in the caravans , by starlight
i hurry over to my window , which is just underneath , and i see a black shape go past my eyes and fall into the water
if this exists , am i ?
what ’ s that to me ?
the spire over the crossing , the two towers were for him like three great cages in which the birds , trained by him , would sing for no one else
i took him in , i brought him up , i fed him , i loved him , i idolized him , and i killed him !
by the age of number he had gone through all four faculties
you speak to him : he ’ s deaf
it ’ s old , and its cartilages have hardened , said another
in a moment the awakened carthaginians appeared on the walls , the houses , the temples
start now , or we ’ ll start up again !
the rich left their doors open ; the town echoed with the rattling of tambourines ; the temples were lit up every night , and the goddess ’ s servants came down from malqua and set up sycamore trestles at street corners , where they prostituted themselves
i will , she stammered
andry the red was laughing like an idiot : notre-dame is making work for the hôtel-dieu , he said
i ’ ll take you to the parisians ’ great musters at the barn at rully
i ’ m a proper wrecker !
then , in the half-light from the wavering torches something dreadful could be dimly seen
the ceiling echoed , as if to a roll on the drums
each one strained to crane his head over his neighbour ’ s shoulder
the old woman shook her head , and said , gazing at the embers :
she recognized it and saw where she was
the fire had put itself out
comrade , it ’ s your last resort
but when at last the dragonfly rested on the tip of a reed and you were able to examine with bated breath the long gauzy wings , the long enamel body , the two crystal globes , how utterly astonished you were and how afraid to see the form once more disappear into shadow and the living creature into a chimera !
everyone wanted a better view of him
she said , it ’ s that nasty man !
but reaching into his sleeves hamilcar drew out two broad cutlasses ; and half bending , left foot forward , eyes flashing , teeth clenched , he stood defying them , motionless beneath the golden candelabra
sometimes he broke off , uttered a harsh , guttural cry ; mâtho ’ s mule increased its speed ; the others hurried to catch them up , then spendius began again , always torn by his anguish
drunkards carried off wineskins , those greedy for food took hunks of meat , cakes , fruit , butter wrapped in fig leaves , snow in linen bags
the priest had remained motionless , finger still pointing at the gibbet , holding his gesture , like a statue
i ’ ll take you to see the lions of the hôtel du roi ; they ’ re wild animals
like a devil astride a gaping muzzle
i don ’ t even know your name
this time it was wide , and the west wind had not blown
you won ’ t even look at me !
no way to get in !
but there are not very many of you , and they will give you nothing !
what ’ s she done to you ?
now all he could see was backs
quasimodo hurried to that tower
this time too she shrugged her white shoulders
the archdeacon put his chin in his hand , and seemed to be reflecting for a moment
naked men were kneading pastes , pounding herbs , stirring up coals , pouring oil into jars , opening and closing the little oval holes hollowed out all round the wall , in such numbers as to make the apartment look like the inside of a beehive
all were full , and the water spread out in one continuous sheet the whole length of the cisterns
hatred , vengeance , massacre and pain !
you know that the official has decided that our twentyone houses depended on the bishopric in full fief , and that we could only redeem that homage by paying the reverend bishop number marcs of silver-gilt to the value of number livres parisis
neither of those things , gervaise
he put his cap on again and sat down
he ’ ll have a taste of that
but for some time now something has been worrying him
; to the right a score of others from conflans to ville-l ’ évêque
the smoking lamp gave barely any light , and he even believed that salammbo was asleep
pomegranate and almond trees , cypresses and myrtles , as still as if their leaves had been of bronze , alternated regularly ; the path , paved with blue pebbles , grated under their steps , and roses in full bloom hung as an arbour over the whole length of the avenue
come here , let me whisper it to you
yes , yes , dom claude
i agree with king edward : save the people and kill the lords—go on , olivier
a tear still showed in her eyes , but it did not move and was so to speak frozen
iddibal came in , without prostrating himself
i ’ ve a good mind to drop this witch hunt and take you in
you are not damned yet , as far as i know
her eyes closed again in terror
around her everyone gazed open-mouthed ; and in truth , while she danced like that , to the thrumming of a tambourine held above her head by her two pure , shapely arms , slim , frail , lively as a wasp , with her golden unpleated bodice , her brightly coloured dress swirling out , her bare shoulders , her slender legs uncovered now and then by her skirt , her dark hair , her blazing eyes , she was a supernatural creature
in a pool of water !
he struck the pavement with his tall stick , with bells on its pommel , and in front of each apartment cried out hamilcar ’ s name , accompanied by praise and blessings
it was a very much finer crowd than nowadays
they both remained silent for some minutes , crushed by the weight of their emotions , he out of his mind , she in a daze
then men brought up and spread out in the middle of the garden fetters , iron collars , knives , chains for those condemned to the mines , leg irons , shoulder shackles , and scorpions , triple-thonged whips with bronze claws at the tip
next to the chair , right by the window , stood a table covered by a cloth with a pattern of birds ; on the table an inkhorn stained with ink , a few parchments , a few quills , and a goblet of chased silver
it was a formidable harangue
fleur-de-lys added in an undertone , her resentment growing with every moment
traces of the mercenaries ’ feast were still to be seen everywhere
later on words were formed
you will never agree !
we already had you in our grasp when that wretched officer turned up
it is because carthage possesses it that carthage is powerful
a huge cellar had been excavated within , closed by an old , broken-down iron grating , and into it were thrown not only the human remains which came off the chains at montfaucon , but the bodies of all the wretches executed at the other permanent gibbets in paris
he no longer believed that the earth was made like a pine cone ; he believed it to be round , and to be falling continuously through the immensity of space , at such prodigious speed that we do not feel it falling
may gurzi , god of battles , tear you to pieces !
the poor girl was quite overcome
two men , one carrying a lantern , had just entered her cell
i remember once knowing a girl who only ever swore by phoebus
this spendid costume , where the light played on it , seemed glazed with flame in every fold
then he stood up
since they had been walking side by side he had not said a word
the poor gypsy shuddered at seeing herself alone with this man
all human justice expired on its threshold
bbs os para golpes
they ’ ve all been despatched
you ’ ve got four minutes to cast your soul at his head
its boundary scooped a large piece out of the countryside where julian had built his baths
one day—another day of bright sunshine—i saw a man pass by who spoke your name , and laughed , and whose eyes were full of lust
if it could be given to us , men of number , to mingle in thought with these fifteenth-century parisians and join them as they go , tugged , jostled , shoved into this immense hall in the palais , so cramped on that number january number , the spectacle would not prove to be without interest or appeal , and everything around us would be so old as to strike us as a novelty
and once you can read , asked the compère , will you make gold ?
hamilcar had quickly reassured them by declaring that there was still enough water in the cisterns for days
the heresiarchs of the middle ages had already made large inroads into catholicism
oh , yes , that is right , repeated the suffete , i am not to die of it !
his heart beat faster still
that to have two females condemned to death clinging to him like this was really too much ; that anyhow his companion would be only too happy to take on the gypsy
sometimes he held his right hand up to his eyes as though looking for someone
the slaves who were meant to throw stones had chosen excessively large ones , which fell down near them
the day their companions had gone the zuaces had returned , pushed down the rocks and fed them for a while
the crowd repeated , and the clapping of ten thousand hands made quasimodo ’ s one eye sparkle with joy and pride
the extreme point of the town ’ s enclosure ( that of charles v ) was at the porte saint-denis and the porte saint-martin , whose site has not changed
finally all recognized that the town was impregnable , until a long terrace was built up to the same height as the walls , enabling them to fight on the same level ; its top would be paved so that the machines could run along on it
the doctor is in front of this table , wearing his heavy greatcoat and his fur cap pulled down over his forehead
humanity obliges me to tell you , observed the king ’ s attorney , that by confessing you must expect the death penalty
three cheers for fun !
i come to you full of contrition
sire , continued olivier le daim with the malicious expression of a man delighted at having to strike a violent blow , it is not at the bailiff of the palais that this popular uprising is directed
you can see that you must die
the witch didn ’ t escape by the rue du mouton
it seemed to me that the goddess had left her garment for you , that it belonged to you !
this dwelling place was his
stick your head through the window
it was indeed jehan , running up as fast as his heavy paladin ’ s costume and a long ladder , which he was valiantly dragging along the pavement , would allow , more out of breath than an ant harnessed to a blade of grass twenty times longer than itself
you do not love me any more !
the long lances , the battle axes , the spears , the felt caps and the bronze helmets , all swayed together in a single movement
he imagined that she might perhaps have returned , that some good spirit had no doubt brought her back , that the little cell was too peaceful , too safe , too delightful for her not to be there , and he dared not take another step for fear of shattering his illusion
what need have i now of father and mother ?
as claude frollo had from his early youth completed the whole circle of positive , external , and lawful human knowledge , he was obliged , short of stopping ubi defuit orbis [ where the circle came to an end ] , to go further and seek other food for the insatiable activity of his intellect
they observed each other ’ s words and actions ; sudden terror woke them up at night
they exchanged their necklets and earrings , presents they had once given each other , after some great danger , in drunken moments
the ships had to go out into the open sea ; who was stopping you ?
he smeared his cheeks with vermilion , to hide his pallor , buckled on his leg armour and his breast plate , swallowed a bowl of neat wine and ran after his troops , who were hurrying towards those from utica
i must confess , maître jacques went on with his shy , awkward smile , that i have tried it on the furnace , but i had no better result than with my own
he said between clenched teeth
he resolved to be ruthless
the hearing , however , had begun without him
i love you and i ’ ve never loved anyone else but you
she could be heard sobbing in the shadows
in that way the archdeacon was the only human being with whom quasimodo had maintained communication
monsieur the king of sicily seals his letters with yellow wax , like a king of france
the officer replied with an air of superior and distinguished gallantry , despise you , god ’ s head !
great kings add a jewel to their crown by being patrons of letters
hamilcar was so angry with carthage that he felt an urge to run to the barbarians and lead them against the city
in certain places they overlooked the height of the ramparts
do you know her name ?
now one of two things must have happened : either they have made themselves scarce , in which case the palliasse they must have forgotten in their terror is precisely that hospitable bed you have been chasing after since this morning , and which our lady the virgin miraculously sent you as a reward for composing in her honour a morality accompanied by triumphs and mummeries ; or the children have not made themselves scarce , in which case they have set the palliasse alight , and there you will find the excellent fire you need to cheer you up , dry you , and warm you
an aromatic smell spread through the streets
there is one big tawny lion i really like for his tricks—have you seen him , maître guillaume ? —princes need to have some of these wonderful animals
but many as they swore at her pitied her ; she was still cherished , perhaps more profoundly
it ’ s not every engagement which ends with a wedding
it is true that the architect found it quite hard to conceal the clock-face which would have destroyed the purity of the façade ’ s fine lines ; but to make up for that there is the colonnade going right round the building , beneath which on high days of religious solemnity the procession of stockbrokers and jobbers can wend its majestic way
yet i could really do with a fireside corner
you ’ ve heard that this man saw it
one morning , let us suppose , someone comes into my shop and says : the lady of flanders wants to save her ministers , the high bailiff is doubling the tax on vegetables , or something
this setback suddenly reversed the volatile mood of the barbarians
then , putting her finger to her lips , she made a sign to the astounded oudarde to put her head through the window and look
wanting to make the most of the little time allowed them , the women ran from one to another , hesitating , palpitating ; then , leaning over these poor bodies , they hit them with all their might like washerwomen beating linen ; screaming the names of their husbands , they tore at them with their nails ; they gouged out their eyes with their hairpins
three palaces around khamon at kesitahs a month !
the balearics went pale as they learned how their companions had perished
the richness of his dress , his great necklace of blue stones , his gold clasps , and heavy earrings only served to make his deformity more hideous
i am a truand , an argoteer , a franc-bourgeois , a petite-flambe , anything you like
she added after a pause :
hamilcar lowered his head , dazzled by these signs of future greatness
but after pillaging temples , seeing numerous nations and massacres , many finished by believing only in fate and death ; and every evening they fell asleep with the same placidity as wild beasts
jehan displayed the wallet , simply and majestically , for the captain to see
finally the people were called together in khamon ’ s square , and it was decided to put things in the hands of hanno , victor of hecatompylus
next day spendius drew him to the bank of the lake
in front of him a strip of canvas stuck on a pole , trailing at the bottom , covered a jumble of baskets , rugs , a lion-skin
tell me the virtues of the vertical boustrophedon , the discoveries made from the numbers ziruph and zephirod
it must be said too that had there been in the throng any charitable soul , any respectable man or woman of the town , who might have felt tempted to bring a glass of water to this wretched creature in distress , there reigned about the infamous steps of the pillory such a prejudice of shame and ignominy as would have repelled the good samaritan
or rather , i believe that she did in fact leave by the porte de vesle , but left this world
as soon as it was dark spendius went to rouse the libyans
you ’ re going to search the dummy and take its purse from it ; if a single bell moves while you ’ re doing so you ’ ll be hanged
the turn of fortune , though delightful , was indeed violent
soon the unfortunate creature saw through the cloud spreading over her eyes the boot approaching , soon she saw her foot enclosed between the iron-bound boards and disappear into the fearful apparatus
a sergeant had to shake her mercilessly , and the president had to raise his voice solemnly , to arouse her :
i always forget her infernal name
that last part of his sentence remained unspoken
then all three , jostling close behind gringoire , began singing their song at him :
an immense clamour came vaguely to him and lying on his back he looked up at the stars
can ’ t you see that i am one of them ?
in love as in everything else he was all for temporizing and the middle course ; and a good supper , in friendly intimacy , seemed to him , especially when he was hungry , an excellent interlude between the prologue and dénouement of an amorous adventure
if the one we are after is , as i believe , the little dancer with the goat , she hates her above all
what does he want , this rascal hanging on to my charger ’ s reins ?
then , as soon as the sun appeared , the temple slaves pushed him towards the square of khamon
this is the time for living , or jupiter is just a rogue !
he had kept on his strong swordbelt , in which gleamed a double-bladed axe , and with his great sword in both hands he had rushed impetuously through the breach
and how will we get out ?
they laughed a lot at such an idea , then continued on their way
the town ’ s three judges appeared , on top of a tower , in a recess of the battlements
fourteen of those who were on the far right , maddened by their wounds , turned on the second rank ; the indians seized their mallet and chisel , and drove it with all their might into the head joint
the deaf man was leaning with his elbows on the balustrade in the place where the archdeacon had been a moment before , and there , never taking his eyes off the only object there was for him in the world at that moment , he stayed unmoving and dumb like a man struck by a thunderbolt , and a long stream of tears flowed silently from that eye which until then had only ever shed a single tear
for a while they remained standing
he flung himself to his knees before her to receive in adoration the word , perhaps of pity , about to come from her lips
down with the mystery !
is that really our venerable rector , maître thibaut ?
meanwhile gringoire , without knowing why , felt somewhat more hopeful at recognizing in the king of the court of miracles his cursed beggar from the great hall
when she disappeared a plaintive bleating was heard
therefore he must follow along the base of the ariana , then turn left , to avoid the mouths of the macar and come straight to the bridge
he advanced like that into the thick of the cavalry , with the calm , slow pace , the swaying head and regular hard breathing of a harvester cutting into a field of corn
and not only the form of the buildings , but also the site chosen for them reveals the thought they represented
the girl , overcome by this violent scene , fell exhausted on her bed , and began weeping and sobbing
they waited one , two , three , five minutes , a quarter of an hour ; nothing came
sometimes they went even further than animals
in any case , as his preoccupied expression showed , he had another cause for concern , which followed hard on his heels and came on to the tribune almost at the same time as he did
what has become of the bedroom in the chancellery where st louis consummated his marriage ’ ?
do i frighten you ?
you could almost say that he had taken its shape , as the snail takes the shape of its shell
they swore to fight for each other to the death
so i denounced you
those things projecting like black beaks between the battlements , which you might from a distance take for waterspouts , are cannon
i ’ ll have to talk all by myself
your head is very grey !
the priests leaned forward on the edge of the great slab – and a new chant burst out , celebrating the joys of death and rebirth in eternity
at this fine hour , cagoux and malingerers , henchmen and rifodés were certainly thinking much less about freeing the gypsy than plundering notre-dame
she was dark , but one could see that in daylight her skin would have the fine golden glow of andalusian and roman women
diamonds sparkled on the black clothes ; but the rings were too big , and slipped off the emaciated hands – and nothing could have been more lugubrious than this silent crowd , with earrings swinging against pale faces , and golden tiaras encircling brows racked with atrocious despair
the dragonfly had become a wasp and would be only too happy to sting
we shall apply to the small of your back the great defensive , consisting of cerate , bole armenie , white of egg , oil , and vinegar
only one of them risked going out , the high priest schahabarim
by the thirst of the desert and the salt of the ocean !
but the bottom of the tent was raised , and a monstrous form appeared
compère tourangeau obeyed , and read this inscription carved on the wall above his head : medicine is the daughter of dreams—jamblichus
as soon as he came up to the workmen abdalonim tried to divert his wrath and make him annoyed with them by muttering complaints about their work
leave me in peace
but the later loss would be too considerable
a fine uniform is fine all the same
at last hamilcar beckoned salammbo and said to her in a low voice :
plain glass replaced stained glass in the windows
a bundle of horrible instruments was thrown to them and each one chose his torture
try and walk straight , monsieur the bachelor of arts
that variety is rare
in both cases the honour of the magistracy remained intact ; for it is much better that a judge should be reputed imbecile or profound than deaf
the linnet has flown , we ’ re left with the bat
wolfs flesh needs dogs ’ teeth , as p matthieu says
they pushed her away quite brutally , and noticed that her head fell back heavily on the paving
once the initial surprise had passed , jehanne de la tarme whispered in la gaultière ’ s ear :
after all , he went on after a silence , who knows ?
jacques charmolue raised his voice
i ’ ll get a sermon , but i ’ ll get an écu too
their chests were crushed by air more oppressive than a tomb , and with their heads under their arms , knees together , stretched to their fullest extent , they shot like arrows through the darkness , choking , groaning , almost dead
it was heavy fire which riddled these wretches with a hail of countless burning drops
the mood was one of ferment
when the swords came they held out their throats and closed their eyes
ask them on the plains of bruttium , the ruins of locri , meta-pontum , and heraclea !
asked jehan frollo du moulin , who could not see what was going on outside from the inside pillar to which he clung
finally hamilcar drew from his chest a little three-headed statuette , blue as sapphire , and set it down before him
at last she said :
the man reading continued :
two long porticoes , whose architraves rested on squat pillars , flanked a square tower , with a crescent moon decorating its platform
whatever am i eating , jupiter !
then he shuddered , seized by a terrible suspicion
but another , keener , desire excited their impatience ; mâtho ’ s death was promised for the ceremony
then , mademoiselle , how do you explain the circumstances with which you are charged ?
they were lances in towers , on terrifyingly armed elephants
youth , however , had gained the upper hand ; and , as often happens , notwithstanding prognoses and diagnoses , nature had amused herself by saving the patient to spite the doctor
they thus added complexity to the whole without disrupting it , completed it without overloading it
that is where mâtho was waiting for him
mistress… anyhow there is no one waiting for you !
they congratulated her ; it was her work
but how are we to extract from science the secret of that general law ?
he was about to be caught between fire and water ; he made a superhuman effort , like a counterfeiter about to be boiled alive trying to escape
saturnalitias mittimus ecce nuces [ here we send some saturnalian nuts ]
clopin interrupted him : i think you are trying to hoodwink us with your patter
then he examined in the tattoos on his arm a horizontal line with two other perpendicular ones , which expressed the number thirteen in canaanite figures
it is true that the clergy did not like to leave them empty , which would imply a lack of fervour among the faithful , and lepers were put in when there were no penitents
then the priest felt a huge hand dragging him by the foot out of the cell
quasimodo fell back in exhaustion
then , as she kept her eyes closed , she heard a rough voice saying very gently : don ’ t be afraid
to go and see la esmeralda , jupiter pathetically replied
later , the first time he clung automatically to the rope in the towers , hung on it , and set the bell swinging , the effect it produced on claude , his adoptive father , was of a child whose tongue is loosened and who begins to talk
this he knew well , he who had commanded them over there and who had returned with the last cohort in the last galley !
then , leaving on the left the gobelins mill with its four white walls , you came to the faubourg saint-jacques , with the handsome carved cross at the crossroads , the church of saint-jacques , which was then a gothic one , pointed and charming , saint-magloire , with a fine fourteenth-century nave used by napoleon as a hay barn , notre-dame des champs , with some byzantine mosaics
prove that i was wrong and that you were telling the truth
how was it to be discovered ?
gringoire was deeply moved by the loyalty of his sole spectator
the slender thongs hissed sharply through the air like a bunch of snakes and came down furiously on the poor wretch ’ s shoulders
the first man who falls back , i ’ ll cut him in two !
the crowd could not control their mirth when they saw quasimodo ’ s naked hump , his camel ’ s chest , his calloused , shaggy shoulders
he wants to make himself king
you ’ ll change clothes with her
there were still more in many places where their traces can be found in traditions , in the absence of any monuments
i had to stay to the end
thus a lot of men disbanded themselves and roamed over the countryside
he had judged that it must come directly towards him , against the most invulnerable part of the wall , which for that very reason , was short of sentries
they were our brothers !
the women made loud protests at this decision ; they coveted the punic ladies ’ jewels
bellevigne de l ’ étoile , andry le rouge , fraçois chante-prune came closer to gringoire
in the mornings he hid in caves ; in the evening he started off again , with his wounds bleeding , starving , sick , living on roots and carrion ; at last one day he saw lances on the horizon and followed them , for his reason was disturbed by terror and privation
is it not enough that all my property has been given to my judges , my plate to monsieur de torcy , my library to maître pierre doriolle , my tapestry to the governor of roussillon ?
today there remains only one quite imperceptible trace of the place de grève as it then existed
the zaïmph fell down , covered her ; she saw mâtho ’ s face bending over her breast
clopin stamped his foot
that damned perrette callebotte !
however , the peculiarly high and steeply pitched roof of the modern palace , bristling with carved gargoyles , covered in lead sheets over which glittering incrustations of gilded copper twisted in a thousand fantastic arabesques , this oddly damascened roof sprang gracefully from amid the brown ruins of the ancient building , whose massive old towers , bulging with the years like casks collapsing with age and splitting from top to bottom , looked like fat bellies released from the support of buttons
he had just wet his lips at the goblet , and spat the liquid out again , saying : ugh !
it will be lovelier still today , their interlocutor finally put in , his patience apparently tried as he listened to them
the danger was imminent and a decision urgent
she embraced his knees
quite so , answered gringoire
he sent out zarxas to mâtho , went through the woods , rallied his men ( losses had not been heavy ) – and furious at having been beaten in battle , they reformed their lines , when someone discovered a vat of paraffin , no doubt abandoned by the carthaginians
when i had seen you twice , i wanted to see you a thousand times , i wanted to see you always
the goat skipped after them , so happy to see gringoire again that she kept making him stumble by sticking her horns between his legs
i protest that it was not i who wrote that to my lord of guyenne , but monsieur the cardinal balue !
three times a month they had their beds set up on the high terrace bordering the wall of the courtyard : and from below one could see them at open air tables , without boots or cloaks , with diamonds on their fingers as they prodded the food and their great earrings leaning against the pitchers – all big and fat , half naked , happy , laughing and eating under the blue sky , like great sharks playing in the sea
she opened her mouth to answer
but next to him was a figure dressed in black and veiled from head to foot who struck her dumb
his sword rose and fell
i tell you she ’ s my daughter !
the unhoped-for testimony of the archer put new spirit into the recluse for whom this interrogation was like crossing over an abyss on a knife-edge
how could anyone imagine , continued dom claude , that every beam from a star is a thread attached to a man ’ s head ?
he tried some other questions but she barely answered
he was seen , and a clamour arose
his army amounted to , men , about twice as many as the barbarian army
what is death , when you come down to it ?
they went on a few steps , and the temple façade spread before them
his eminence ’ s entrance had a shattering effect on the audience
it was obvious that everything in her was shattered
there is noah ’ s misadventure carved in explicit detail , as in the great doorway at bourges
the first had a big , stupid face , drunk and dumbfounded
hamilcar was counting with the beads ; they rattled under his fingers
hamilcar , back at last with salammbo , untied hannibal
she had drawn back into a corner ; but she took a step towards him , and stretching out her bare arm :
from the movement of her lips quasimodo thought she was sending him off : so he stood up and limped away , slowly , hanging his head , not even daring to look up at the girl with his eye full of despair
the feathered bolt whistled and stuck in the hunchback ’ s left arm
his head was on fire
i ask you , oudarde , putting the devil with the foundlings !
a poor old woman now , but used to be a pretty girl , my lords
and there was i thinking it was all to do with the bailiff !
the girls laugh at me
landlady , my love , some other wine !
some devout men had at first tried to count them , to see if their number corresponded to the days of the solar year ; but others were added and it was impossible to distinguish them in the dizzy movement of the horrible arms
the same silence as before
the little island appeared in the shadows like a dark mass on the far side of the pale strip of water separating him from it
every toad that is baptized should be dressed in red or black velvet , with a little bell round its neck and another on its feet
she told how he climbed the mountains of ersiphonia , of the journey to tartessus , and the war against masisabal to avenge the serpent queen :
but vague ruins , heaps of black earth , gardens made darker masses in the shadows , and down in malqua fishing nets stretched from one house to another , like gigantic bats spreading their wings
it is never more solid than when it lacks all reason
they looked like two statues facing each other
this something , or rather someone , was a blind man , a little blind man with a bearded jewish face , who , as he swept the area round him with a stick , with a big dog towing him along , said in a nasal hungarian accent : facitote caritatem !
just remember : when she appeared , how all the torches paled
you can not imagine his joy on the days of a full peal
the forty-two colleges were distributed fairly evenly , and were to be found everywhere ; the varied and amusing summits of these fine buildings were products of the same art as the simple roofs they dominated , and amounted to no more than the same geometrical figure multiplied by its square or its cube
from inside the wall a throaty laugh responded to these bloodthirsty words
the state of that soul , the habits it had contracted , the shape it had taken beneath that constricting envelope , leading so unsociable a life , such questions would be hard to determine
with considerable difficulty he was torn away from this contemplation , but at last he turned round , and at a sign from him two men in yellow , the executioner ’ s assistants , came up to the gypsy to fasten her hands again
if utica alone were captured , hippo-zarytus , six hours further along the coast , would replace it , and the metropolis , thus provisioned , would prove impregnable
the archdeacon returned to his cell dumbfounded , finally realizing the identity of compère tourangeau , and recalling this passage from the cartulary of saint-martin of tours :
during the night following la esmeralda ’ s execution , the executioner ’ s men had taken down her body from the gibbet and carried it , according to custom , into the cellar at montfaucon
he put a hand on the arrow , tore it from his arm , and calmly snapped it over his huge knee
but their position made them indispensable
or on your knees , said rym
it was mere chance that he was at the feast – his father had made him live in the barca household , according to the custom of kings who sent their children to stay with the families of the great in order to prepare marriages ; but in the six months that narr ’ havas had been there , he had not yet seen salammbo ; and , squatting on his heels , beard bent over the shafts of his javelins , he watched her , with nostrils flaring , like a leopard crouched in bamboo
the palais bailiff is obliged to deliver the malefactor after sentence to be executed , if it ’ s a lay person to the provost of paris ; if a clerk , to the bishop ’ s official
isn ’ t it so , master ?
he went off immediately to the western provinces , to take his revenge in the very places which had seen his shame
at regular intervals they came upon small square temples , used as stages for the pilgrims going to sicca
what would the throne of france mean to me when i could rebuild the empire of the orient !
it was truly a sight worthy of a more intelligent spectator than phoebus to see how these lovely girls , with their poisonous , angry tongues , coiled , slithered , and twisted round the street dancer
then , suddenly , narr ’ havas marched resolutely towards a sentry
the abbadirs , stones which had fallen from the moon , swung in slings of silver wire ; little loaves , in the shape of a woman ’ s sex , were borne on baskets by the priests of ceres ; others brought their fetishes , and their amulets ; forgotten idols reappeared ; and the mystic symbols had even been taken from the ships , as though carthage wanted to give herself up totally to thoughts of death and desolation
nothing makes a man more adventurous than an empty feeling behind his waistband
so they freed themselves , threw off the yoke of architecture and each went its own way
he demanded prerogatives for his men and set them up in important posts ; and the barbarians all looked wide-eyed when they saw the numidians on the towers
what must one be to please you ?
then jehan had hidden himself behind one of the stone kings , not daring to breathe , staring at the monstrous hunchback with a look of terror , like the man who , paying court to the wife of a menagerie keeper , went one night to keep a tryst , climbed over the wrong wall and suddenly found himself confronting a polar bear
let ’ s bet those are pebbles !
baal-samin , god of the heavenly spaces ; baal-peor , god of the sacred mountains ; baal-zebub , god of corruption , and those of neighbouring countries and related races : the iarbal of libya , the aldrammelech of chaldea , the kijun of the syrians ; derceto , virgin faced , crawled on her fins , and tammouz ’ corpse was drawn on the middle of a catafalque , among torches and shorn hair
you hide your sorrows from me , you despise your old nurse !
cried the girl , burying her face in her hands
all around him was stone ; before his eyes the gaping monsters ; below , at the very bottom , in the square , the pavement ; above his head quasimodo weeping
the recluse did not stir
hamilcar , carried away by some spirit , continued , standing on the topmost step of the altar , quivering , terrible ; he raised his arms , and the rays from the candelabra burning behind him , shone through his fingers like golden spears
he went out into the fields to gather herbs for the sick
come on , he said between his teeth , on our way !
that gave me something to think about
her teeming crowds are as though lost in the dust of your sandals , and all its treasures , together with the provinces , the fleets and the islands do not move me with desire like the coolness of your lips and the curve of your shoulders
let them talk , little girl !
quasimodo gasped for the third time
the slave said to him
the mighty city had burst successively four rings of walls like a growing child splitting its last year ’ s clothes
besides mâtho , who was a brave man , would not abandon them
surprised , intoxicated , spellbound , i let myself go on looking at you
it looked like a veil hiding your face ; you looked through at me ; your memory was mingled with its rays ; i could no longer distinguish between the two of you !
he said ; i was forgetting … it ’ s our custom not to hang a man without asking if there ’ s a woman who wants him
then he prostrated himself in sign of slavery , and as evidence of his loyalty recalled all his behaviour since the beginning of the war
the night before , as a precaution , they had made a wide detour
i can tell you , i gave the carter a piece of my mind !
they all had rights over the public highway
she no longer had any hope , she no longer knew what she wanted , but she did not want them to take her daughter away from her
april turns her back on january
the gypsy crouched down on her knees , and rested the goat ’ s head against her cheek as it caressed her
hamilcar listened hard for a few minutes , still afraid of seeing them return
the moon glided between two clouds
there was some booing , for the tyranny of the male principle prevailed that day in the consciousness of all , and the goddess had even been forgotten to such an extent that the absence of her pontiffs had passed unnoticed
the idea of yet again losing life , hope , phoebus , whom she still glimpsed in her future , the absolute void in which her weakness left her , all escape cut off , unsupported , abandoned , isolated , all these thoughts and countless others overwhelmed her
went on fleur-de-lys ; don ’ t you remember ?
that of charles iv ?
taanach lit in the corners of the apartment four tripods full of strobus and cardamom ; then she unfolded some big babylonian tapestries and stretched them on cords all round the room , for salammbo did not want to be seen , even by the walls
it was in fact the king ’ s troops arriving
the veil itself is divine , because it is part of her
the space that the barbarians had in front of them , full of swirling confusion , drew them on like a whirlpool ; some threw themselves in
i had a child !
the hall was spacious and gloomy , which made it look all the more spacious
then mâtho , frightened by the silence , said to spendius :
gradually the flood of houses , constantly driven outwards from the heart of the town , overflowed this enclosure , eroded it , wore it down , erased it
his immobility had something of the hawk who has just discovered a sparrows ’ nest and is watching it
a street opened in front of him ; he found it so dark and deserted that he hoped to escape there from all the echoes and illuminations of the festival
bring in the others !
he had sat down again , in gloomy silence , in his big armchair , his elbow back in its usual position on the table , his forehead against his hand
then , advancing with great care , they felt the wall to find a way out
the eunuchs , the slaves , the women had been carefully removed ; no one could know the mystery that was being prepared
muttered maître andry musnier
at the hôtel saint-pol you will find forty archers of monsieur the dauphin ’ s new guard , take them ; and with all those men hasten to notre-dame
then the church could be seen in all its length , stretching into the deep interior , dark , hung with mourning , dimly lit by a few candles twinkling in the distance on the high altar , opening like a cave mouth in the middle of a square filled with dazzling light
he had acquired the general viciousness
they implored him ; and as the word treachery ’ began to recur in their speeches he lost his temper
here ’ s one , said the archdeacon
i do not believe in medicine
gringoire gave a start
nothing , phoebus answered
the young lady appeared to be begging the officer to make no further demands on her
he paused once more , then continued :
he took the cup and was raising it to his lips when a gaul , the same one whom gisco had wounded , clapped him on the shoulder , jovially uttering jesting remarks in his native tongue
some could be seen climbing up and down the two stairways connecting storeys
if we were not in the fifteenth century , we should say that gringoire had descended from michelangelo to callot
some who did not die were pursued and went to drown in the sea
they asked for anything they found beautiful : a ring , a belt , sandals , the fringe of a dress , and when the denuded carthaginian cried : but i have nothing else
the night , as already mentioned , was extremely dark
the young cavalier wore the dazzling uniform of captain of archers of the ordinance of the king , much too closely resembling jupiter ’ s costume , which the reader has already been able to admire in the opening book of this story , for us to inflict on him a second description
a yellow wax candle lit up this scene of voracity and reflection
his jehan , his beloved brother , his spoilt child , came to his door more than once , knocked , swore , said a dozen times who he was
if you knew how pretty you were at four months !
the ladder , hurled backwards , for an instant stayed straight and upright , seemed to waver , swayed , then suddenly , describing a terrifying arc number feet in radius , crashed down on the pavement with its load of bandits more swiftly than a drawbridge when its chains snap
they lived , these people , without employment , far from the apartments , slept at night in the gardens , ate up the kitchen scraps – a human mildew sprouting in the shadow of the palace
the moment she saw what was inside , a profound pity was depicted on all her features , and her cheerful , open face changed expression and colour as abruptly as if it had gone from sunshine to moonlight
quasimodo had stopped beneath the great portal
they are to be found in every age , always the same , that is always in tune with the age
three sorts of damage can be distinguished on the ruins , and they all affect it at different depths : first is time , which has chipped it away imperceptibly here and there and left rust all over its surface ; then political and religious revolutions which , blind and angry by their very nature , have hurled themselves upon it in tumult , rent its rich array of sculptures and carvings , smashed its rose-windows , broken its necklaces of arabesques and figurines , torn down its statues , sometimes for wearing a mitre , sometimes a crown ; finally fashions , increasingly silly and absurd , which after the splendidly anarchic deviations of the renaissance , have succeeded one another in the inevitable decline of architecture
now we have observed that judges generally arrange things so that the day when they are sitting is also the day when they are in a bad temper , in order always to have someone on whom to vent their spleen conveniently , in the name of the king , the law , and justice
wait , she said
then the suflete ’ s slaves went forward to look for the markers which , on his orders had been placed at intervals
claude put him out to nurse
it reappeared on the first floor
the king of france himself , for knocking thoughtlessly one evening on the thaumaturge ’ s door , sank up to his knees into his own paris pavement—that happened less than three hundred years ago
they came to an oval opening , protected by a gate
why didn ’ t i think of it before ?
some had squeezed between the stones ; other , bolder ones , had let themselves down with ropes
she was subjugated , quivering , shattered , in his arms , at his mercy
i want to go away !
rumble grève , bay grève !
he preened himself as he replied : it ’ s a latin word meaning sun
phoebus was no longer there
from the end of the fifteenth century it was encroached upon , superseded , and the suburbs ran still further out
clopin climbed on to a big stone
no , no , i won ’ t listen
take that off , mâtho told him , i know that you are a brave man !
the priests of khamon , in fawn woollen robes , lined up in front of their temple , under the columns of the portico ; those of eschmoûn , in linen mantles , with coucoupha-headed necklets and pointed tiaras , took up position on the steps of the acropolis ; the priests of melkarth , in violet tunics , took up the western side ; the priests of the abbadirs , tightly wrapped in bands of phrygian stuff , placed themselves to the east ; and on the southern side were drawn up , with the necromancers tattooed all over , the ranters in the patched cloaks , the attendants of the pataeci gods and the yidonim , who foretold the future by putting in their mouths a bone from a corpse
the people are trying to recover her by force
he raised his cap again , and went on still musing , with the look and tone of a huntsman urging on and launching his pack : good !
but that ’ s no distance , sir
i am the son of an impoverished family , my dear fellow
then the king dismissed rym and coppenole with a gesture : god keep you , messieurs , my good friends the flemings
he speaks when he wants to , said the old woman
then the sun rose ; it struck at the back of her head and she involuntarily became a little drowsy
whence the prodigious external variety of these buildings where so much order and unity are essentially lodged
they choked men with their trunks , or tore them from the ground and delivered them to the soldiers in the towers ; they used their tusks to disembowel them , and threw them up into the air , so that long entrails hung round their ivory teeth like bundles of rigging on a mast
gringoire was more dead than alive
his foot struck a sword
women and children went to collect stones on the shore , picked up earth in their hands and brought it to the soldiers
the dying could be seen writhing , half charred to ashes , roaring with pain
interfacings , lozenges , lines of pearls alternated on the walls , and a railing of silver filigree formed a wide semi-circle in front of the bronze stairway coming down from the vestibule
it was indeed the king ’ s doctor , a man of about number , whose hard features were tempered only by his crafty look
narr ’ havas had already let loose his cavalry ; the barbarians all threw themselves on the ground face downwards ; then when the horses were three paces away , they leaped up under their bellies and slashed them open with a dagger thrust ; half the numidians had perished when barca arrived
sometimes a group of squalid old women , spread out squatting over the steps of some shady porch , loudly grumbling as the archdeacon and bell-ringer went by , and mumbling their malice with some such encouraging welcome as : hm !
he had sent narr ’ havas to carthage to bring news of the victory ; and the numidian king , proud of his success , presented himself to salammbo
i nunc , anima anceps , et sit tibi deus misericors !
the archdeacon , as though waking up with a start , held back his arm with convulsive violence
one must take what comes
i ’ ll have him buckled back on the leather bed when i get back
forgive me then this time , our lady of paris
however , gervaise spoke to her : and did they ever find out what became of la chantefleurie ?
the gods execrate her !
they turned through narrow streets , amidst the darkness
after a moment ’ s pause : forward , lads !
later , at sicca , i made them all furious with fear of the republic !
just as you like , replied the neighbour
i thank you , monsieur
what are you saying ?
most of them did not even know what they wanted
at your service , said the captain
she had missed nothing of the scene between gudule and tristan , and each of her mother ’ s fits of anguish had found an echo in her
what a memory the good lady has for bygone things !
a roar of laughter from all the students greeted the unfortunate name of the poor skinner-furrier of the king ’ s wardrobe
but his mind working as lucidly as in the heat of battle , he recalled hundreds of odious things , ignominies from which he had turned aside ; and in the fire of his anger , as in the lightning of a storm , he saw in a flash all his disasters simultaneously
it was the poor goat , the agile djali , who had escaped after her , just as quasimodo was scattering charmolue ’ s brigade , and who had been lavishing caresses on her feet for the best part of an hour without being able to get so much as a glance from her
his eyes followed her every movement ; it was his last ray of hope
they were already surrounded
it was like a cabirus ’ s joy ; and the great rays of light striking his face seemed to him like the end of an invisible network which spanned abysses to attach him to the centre of the world
well said , upon my soul !
they were unsure , disconcerted as the barbarians always were at being confronted with walls
the cloister door was closed
now it was the priest who was threatening , quasimodo who was begging
and then i ’ m like the maréchal de gié at the siege of pontoise , my right is resting on a little bulge in the contours
the unanimous testimony of the men of the watch confirmed the old sergeant ’ s words for the provost
but now he seemed at once calmer and deadlier ; an arrogant will flashed in his eyes , like the flame of a sacrifice
on the left , right down below , the canals of megara began to wind their white coils across the greenery of the gardens
the individual who had thus screwed a whole panoply on to his body was so completely hidden beneath his battle order that nothing could be seen of him but an impudent , snub , red nose , a lock of fair hair , a pink mouth and bold eyes
it is the goddess ’ s mantle !
this perhaps ’ , so dear to philosophers , emboldened gringoire
he liked to compare himself to mahomet ’ s tomb , attracted in opposite directions by two lodestones , eternally hesitating between high and low , ceiling and floor , falling and rising , zenith and nadir
the old slave seemed to know the danger that was alarming hamilcar , and went on :
they had carried ancestors about , triumphed in wars , and were worshipped as favourites of the sun
these turned round and ran straight at the carthaginians : they overturned , then crushed them underfoot , and driving them back like this came up to hanno ’ s tent , where he was at that moment with thirty carthaginians , the most illustrious of the elders
they hurried down the tower stairs , crossed the church , all dark and lonely , but echoing with the uproar , which made a dreadful contrast , and came out into the cloister garth by the red door
do you know where you are going ?
look , he said in an undertone to his companion , robert poussepain , who sniggered beside him as he gave a commentary on the scenes being enacted before their eyes , there ’ s jehanneton du buisson , the pretty daughter of that idle dog at the marché neuf
spendius had recovered his courage
an old man with a child was there , in the courtyard , and wanted to see the suffete
however utica and hippo-zarytus were free , since the mercenaries had lifted their siege
the women showed the small children their fine robes hanging in tatters on their emaciated limbs
associated with each of these typical monuments by similarity of style , manner , and attitude are a certain number of houses scattered through different districts , which the connoisseur ’ s eye can easily pick out and date
an individual , who stood within the balustrade in the space left clear round the marble table , had so far gone unnoticed , so completely was his long , slender person protected from every line of sight by the diameter of the pillar on which he was leaning
it was the agreed signal from the priest to the executioner
we were kind enough to change your name from le mauvais [ the bad ] , which is too much like your appearance
they had believed phoebus to be dead , and there was no more to be said
the girl said tenderly
he stuck his hand in his pocket in such a daze that she stopped
so communication between him and them had been rapid , electric , and , so to speak , on an equal footing
maître andry looked up , seemed for a moment to be gauging the height of the pillar , the weight of the young rascal , mentally multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity , and shut up
he drank a long draught
the city , then , first struck the eye with its stern to the east and its prow to the west
a pretty woman , upon my word—and who must love me madly to have taken me as she did
after a second attempt , it was explained that the cups were locked up in a temple
clopin trouillefou , having arrived before the lofty portal of notre-dame , had indeed formed his troops into battle order
from that moment on maître coppenole enjoyed in paris , as he did in ghent , high esteem with the people ; for men of such stature do so , says philippe de commines , when they are thus unruly
it is not unusual for the weariness caused by extreme grief to have this effect on the mind
a breach opened in it
but for the fiery blush on her cheeks , seeing her thus silent and motionless , one would have taken her for a statue of modesty
spendius understood that he was full of immense anxiety ; he did not dare say any more
that will do , went on the imperturbable auditor when he assumed that the accused had completed his third answer
buildings belonging exclusively to one of these three strata are perfectly distinct , unified , and complete
kiss me , foolish girl !
plunder them , hang them , sack them !
no , phoebus , no , i ’ ll be your mistress , for your amusement , pleasure , whenever you like , a girl who ’ ll be yours , that ’ s all i was made for , soiled , despised , dishonoured , but , what of it ? —loved
thus , to sum up what we have said so far in an inevitably incomplete and abbreviated form , mankind has two books , two records , two testaments : masonry and printing , the stone bible and the paper bible
thus carthage lay revealed to the soldiers established on the plain
camp followers with slings were spaced out on the flanks
she ’ s our sister ; —we must get her out of there
they spread out in a long straight line , which overlapped the wings of the punic army in order to envelop it completely
the day a woman spurned such a love i should have thought the mountains would move
taking excessive precautions he now went on foot , near her and between the two horses ; and he kept whipping them with the end of a leather thong rolled round his arm , or took from a bag hanging on his chest balls of wheat , dates and yolk of egg , wrapped in lotus leaves , which he offered to salammbo , without speaking , as he ran along
jehan interrupted , i ’ d like to be the demon sidragasum
spendius talked to him of his journeys , of the peoples and temples he had visited , and he knew a great deal : he could make sandals , spears , nets , tame wild beasts , and cook fish
she turned on her heels , right and left at random , looking for a ladder , a rope , a stone , something to help her
next to it , the enormous towers of notre-dame , seen thus from behind with the long nave over which they rise , silhouetted in black against the vast , red glow filling the parvis , looked like the two gigantic firedogs of a cyclopean fire
it was a squadron of the king ’ s troop on counter-patrol by order of robert d ’ estouteville , keeper of the provostry of paris
it is certain that this monastery , of imposing appearance both as a church and as a manorial seat , this abbatial palace , where the bishops of paris counted themselves lucky to spend even one night , this refectory on which the architect had conferred the appearance , the beauty , and the splendid rose-window of a cathedral , this elegant lady chapel , this monumental dormitory , vast gardens , portcullis , drawbridge , enveloping battlements , cutting out notches from the view of the green meadows around them , courtyards where men in shining armour mingled with gold copes , all grouped and gathered round the three tall romanesque spires set firmly on a gothic apse , made an altogether magnificent figure on the horizon
this flight from nature , life , himself , mankind , god , from everything , lasted all day
just look at that face !
at the idea of clasping her in my arms a frenzy of joy seizes me , and yet i hate her , spendius !
but there were nasty rumours going round about them stealing children and cutting purses and eating human flesh
then he slumped so low over the chair and table that jehan could not see him behind the huge chair-back
he ’ s probably dead , someone replied
she said that the schalischim looked furious , that he had shouted a lot , had then fallen asleep
king of the two zones , self-begetting creator , father and mother , father and son , god and goddess , goddess and god !
cried the people for their part , and this immense acclamation could be heard on the opposite bank of the seine , amazing the crowd on the grève and the recluse who was still waiting with eyes fixed on the gibbet
we ’ ve no resistance to fear in the church
a big dog sat on its rump , looking at the fire
gudule ’ s heart , so horribly compressed , now dilated , and she murmured , casting a glance at her daughter whom she had not yet dared to look at since the men ’ s arrival : saved !
fornication is a most licentious thought
djali , went on the girl , emboldened by her growing success , how does maître jacques charmolue , the king ’ s attorney in the ecclesiastical court , look when he preaches ?
gringoire had passed from the love of an idea to love of the form of that idea
i beseech you , he cried , if you have feelings , do not reject me !
he cried : a carthaginian !
so you can see that she came of good family
then the abundance that carthage had enjoyed made them furiously jealous
gringoire leaned over and whispered in the archdeacon ’ s ear , glancing anxiously up and down the street , though no one was passing by
he cried , with a laugh that bared his teeth and made his face look like a wolfs muzzle , two mice in the mouse-hole !
her eyes were dark and splendid , in the midst of her black hair a few loose strands shone as bright as gold thread where the sun had penetrated
where their hair had been torn out in tufts the sores on their heads were exposed , and they were so thin and hideous that they looked like mummies in tattered shrouds
they are rogues from the court of miracles
said the student ; this must be it
what does it matter to you if i am there when your eyes are closed ?
then the servant busied himself reading out all the proceeds of the iron mines of annaba , the coral fisheries , the purple works , the farming of the tax on resident greeks , the export of silver to arabia , where it was worth ten times as much as gold , captured vessels , less a tithe for the goddess ’ s temple
men were pushing with chest and arms , while others pulled , in harness
i ’ m very cold , she answered
they did not lose heart , and marched behind him
gervaise went on , and the little one with little eyes , with red-rimmed eyelids , all plucked and jagged like a thistle-head ?
dom claude just had time to fling himself to the ground to avoid a meeting , face to face , with his brother and being recognized by him
gisco slipped his fingers under the man ’ s jaw , for the helmet chinstrap eventually produced twin calloused patches there ; these were called carobs , and to have carobs ’ was an expression for a veteran
once he turned up just as she was fondling djali
involuntarily she drew nearer to him , and moved to acknowledge his pride she poured him a long stream of wine into a golden cup to reconcile herself with the army
meanwhile the man began climbing the ladder
they killed them with their lances ; they ate them , and with full stomachs their thoughts were less gloomy
the crescent moon , which had just taken off above the horizon , stopped at that moment on top of the right-hand tower and seemed to be perching , like some luminous bird , on the edge of the balustrade , with its pattern of cut-out trefoils
in the middle of the terrace was a small ivory bed , covered with lynx skins , with cushions of parrot feathers ( a soothsaying creature sacred to the gods ) , and in the four corners rose four long burners full of spikenard , incense , cinnamon , and myrrh
that ’ s a fixed fee
a large head bristling with red hair ; between his shoulders an enormous hump , the effects of which were also visible in front ; an assemblage of thighs and legs so strangely distorted that they touched only at the knees and , from the front , looked like two sickle blades joined at the handle ; big feet , monstrous hands ; and with all that deformity a certain air of fearsome energy , agility , and courage ; a strange exception to the eternal rule which says that strength , like beauty , results from harmony
it was the first time for many hours that he felt no pain
each of them felt somehow injured in her own beauty
by the way , brother claude , a florin for not breathing
as for the little one—smelarda as they call her—i shall await your orders
you , priest , you are old !
then he went up to salammbo ’ s palace
those on the other hand who did not know hamilcar were quite delirious in their delight at having him in their grasp
cut off all their hands , and bring them to me in baskets !
first of all , to give only a few major examples , there are assuredly few finer pages in architecture than that façade where successively and simultaneously the three recessed , pointed doorways , the embroidered and serrated band of the twenty-eight royal niches ; the immense central rose-window , flanked by the two side windows like the priest by deacon and sub-deacon , the lofty , slender gallery of trefoiled arches supporting a heavy platform on its delicate small columns ; finally the two dark , massive towers with their slate eaves , harmonious parts of a magnificent whole , rising one above the other in five gigantic storeys , all unfold before one ’ s eye , multitudinous and unconfused with their innumerable details of statuary , sculpture , and carvings , adding powerfully to the calm grandeur of the whole ; a vast symphony in stone , so to speak ; the colossal work of a man and a people , at the same time one and complex , like its sisters the iliads and the romanceros , the prodigious result of contributions made from all the resources of an age , where every stone displays in hundreds of ways the workman ’ s imagination disciplined by the artist ’ s genius ; a kind of human creation , in a word , as mighty and fruitful as the divine creation whose dual character it seems to have abstracted : variety , eternity
do not break out into thunder over such a nonentity as myself
listen , jehan , he added in a low voice , be sure you never speak of what you see and hear here
and leaning over the carvings with the dazzled look of someone demonstrating living phenomena : don ’ t you think , for example , that this metamorphosis in basse-taille has been executed with much skill , delicacy , and patience ?
some epirote shepherds ran to the left hand wing of the clibanarii and seized the horses by the mane as they whirled their staves ; the animals , throwing their riders , ran off over the plain
it was a sort of investment of good works made on his young brother ’ s account ; a parcel of good deeds which he wanted to put together for him in advance , in case the young rascal might one day find himself short of such currency , the only one accepted at the toll gate of paradise
at that thought , the eyes she was running over the populace filled with grief
spendius did not admit his terror and persisted in claiming that his leg was broken
the mercenaries ’ bad faith was not as complete as their enemies thought
she found herself all alone
at last he shook his head and swung into the saddle
i don ’ t want to wreck my religion on his metaphysics !
some of them had pennons and some banners
panting with terror she tried to pull free
i know , said mâtho
usually the murmur that comes from paris in the daytime is the city speaking ; at night it is the city breathing ; here it is the city singing
bellevigne de l ’ étoile , the king of tunis said to a huge truand who stepped forward , get up on the crossbar
civilization has not yet reached the point where one can go about naked , as old diogenes wanted
the colleges , as they arrived , ranged themselves in the temple courtyards , on the outer galleries and along the double stairways which went up against the walls and met at the top
he expressed his sympathy for the trouble she was about to suffer
this time , however , its burning greed had led it into disgrace and danger
a number , from laziness or prudence , had stayed at the entrance to the defile
grève bay , grève rumble
i left the key in the door on purpose
they say she ’ s a witch , and that her goat performs quite miraculous tricks
he spent whole days with his face pressed against his window panes
and the great hall , with its gilding , its azure colouring , pointed arches , statues , pillars , the immense vault fretted with carvings ?
you are ruining us !
the road snaked up and down over small hills
quasimodo looked at him , was seized with trembling , let go of the priest and drew back
so—for fifteen years now i ’ ve been here , fifteen years i ’ ve been suffering , fifteen years i ’ ve been praying , fifteen years i ’ ve been banging my head against these four walls
one should always lend , and at different rates of interest , according to people ’ s wealth
here , you deaf rascal !
the priest thought of midday
for the rest , the people in the districts she frequented loved her for her gaiety , her kindness , her lively ways , her dancing and singing
some fine mansions also projected magnificently over the picturesque attics of the left bank , the logis de nevers , the logis de rome , the logis de reims which have since disappeared ; the hôtel de cluny , which still remains for the artist ’ s consolation , and whose tower was so stupidly pollarded a few years ago
the gypsy girl had stirred no more than he had
then you send them off with their wives and children , every one , without keeping a single hostage !
besides , all this floated around in her head in a melancholy haze like the memory of an oppressive dream ; and she could not have found the means or the words to express it
from time to time she asked if they would soon be there
my herd of swine did us more good than a phalanx of spartans
however , when she saw her captain come in , she found him looking so fine , with his new acton , his gleaming baldrick , his passionate air , that she blushed with pleasure
whence the countless swift transformations of this architecture , only three centuries old , so striking after the stagnating immobility of romanesque architecture , which was six or seven centuries old
there was a clattering of rakes and furnaces
besides , using the veil as a shield , he held it out to left , to right , in front , behind ; and they could think of no expedient
he said in a muffled voice
with time an indefinable close bond had been formed uniting the bell-ringer and the church
but here are strong men whose hatred has been aroused !
but he clapped his hands three times
and as the cauldron and the frying pan were not listening but continued their duet , he jumped down from his barrel , gave the cauldron a mighty kick , which sent it rolling ten yards away with the boy inside , kicked over the frying pan , spilling all the fat on to the fire , and then solemnly climbed back on his throne , paying no heed to the child ’ s muffled sobs nor to the old woman ’ s grumbling at the sight of her supper going up in a fine sheet of white flame
he was silhouetted against the sky
at notre-dame it was a cell constructed in the roof space of the side-aisles beneath the flying buttresses , facing the cloister , exactly at the spot where the wife of the present concierge of the towers has contrived for herself a garden , which is to the hanging gardens of babylon what a lettuce is to a palm tree , or a porter ’ s wife to semiramis
the barbarians had leaped outside the fences
jacques charmolue intervened : if it please you , messieurs , we shall proceed with the interrogation of the goat
this was termed turning ’ a criminal
it passed like a cloak under the idol ’ s face , sweeping up to spread over the wall , fastened up by the corners , all at once blue as the night , yellow as the dawn , crimson as the sun , manifold , diaphanous , sparkling , light
gringoire pressed on none the less
he suddenly felt a coolness on his face and found himself beneath the door of the topmost gallery
their boldness is quite amazing , and angers us greatly
the fires of the forward posts shone like lost stars
we ’ ll show you , pasque-dieu , whether we are a king or not !
he stood bare-headed , holding a long scroll , behind the armchair on which sat , inelegantly doubled up , knees crossed , elbow on the table , a very meanly turned-out individual
the girl listened to him , looked at him
great wings made shadows hover round them , croaking rent the air ; and as spendius ’ cross was the highest one , it was on his that the vulture came down
finally , between the rue saint-denis and the rue montorgueil , the filles-dieu
the sun was going down behind the waves ; its rays like long arrows struck the crimson heart
he ’ s the one who cast me into this abyss
libyan women , riding on donkeys , reviled negresses who had abandoned the brothels of malqua for the soldiers ; a number of them suckled children slung round their necks on a leather strap
yet he had received from his family some education and some manners ; but he was too young when he had started to roam the country , too young when he had begun garrison duty , and with every day more of the gentlemanly veneer was rubbed away by the harsh pressure of his soldier ’ s baldric
from which clock , if you please ?
in doing so he began your misfortunes , and mine , and his own
it was louis xl
calm gradually returned to la esmeralda ’ s soul
there was , however , no shortage of light
the stolen child cried and yelled
for some moments , the girl , absorbed in her delightful thoughts , had been dreaming to the sound of his voice without taking in the meaning of his words
meanwhile men sent by the suffete were arriving in the streets
often , on the hilltops , black tents collapsed as though blown over by the wind , and large discs with gleaming edges , recognizable as cartwheels spinning with a mournful sound , gradually plunged into the valleys
then the horde of merchants , all the sellers of wine and oil , furious at not being paid , grumbled at the republic ; spendius declaimed against it
by the way , my lovely , what ’ s your name ?
it ’ s crazy to stop half-way in what is monstrous !
suddenly narr ’ havas quietened them , and turning their backs they trotted back towards the hills
all resistance had been made impossible for him by what was then termed , in the style of the criminal chancellery , the vehemence and firmness of his bonds ’ , which means that the thongs and chains were probably cutting into his flesh
you are not shouting so loudly today !
is that you , master ?
bell-ringer of notre-dame at number , a new disability had come to make him complete : the bells had ruptured his eardrums ; he had become deaf
she listened , deeply touched
at that critical moment , he took counsel within himself , with a better and speedier line of reasoning than might have been expected of so ill-organized a brain
aiglet de soins , hutin de mailly
to have succeeded only in laying her down on the leather bed !
on the judges ’ part it was the hope of being soon able to sit down to supper
thus , to give only a summary statement of a law which it would take volumes to develop , in the high orient , cradle of primitive times , after hindu architecture came phoenician architecture , opulent mother of arab architecture ; in antiquity , after egyptian architecture , of which the etruscan style and the cyclopean monuments are only a variation , came greek architecture , of which the roman style is simply an extension , with the carthaginian dome put on top ; in modern times , after romanesque architecture came gothic
made of red leather , and covered in embroidery with three diamond stars , it bore stamped in its middle the grand council ’ s mark : a horse under a palm-tree
do you hear , usher ?
she looked up , and indeed recognized the poet
phoebus , quite put out , followed
he came in then , greeted the audience with the hereditary smile which the great bestow on the people , and advanced with measured step towards his scarlet armchair , looking as though his thoughts were elsewhere
the moon shone red as blood in a pale circle and their scarlet tongues , formed like fishing harpoons , stretched out , curling to the edge of the flame
besides the expense was bound to be excessive ; he would be liable for almost all of it
he was a poor child , both thin and puffy ; his skin looked as grey as the filthy rag hanging round his waist ; his head was sunk on to his shoulders , and with the back of his hand he rubbed his fly-infested eyes
in wooden bowls from tamrapanni great lumps of fat floated in saffron
she ran away with loud cries as soon as she saw the soldiers ’ pikes through the rocks
the rustling of the veil as it brushed against the stones reminded him of his new power ; but excessive as his hopes were , he now no longer knew what he ought to do ; this uncertainty unnerved him
they shone in the depths of an amphitheatre
captain phoebus ’ heart , like the physics of the time , abhorred a vacuum
at each stage some of them died ; several times they thought they were lost
among others there was a group of these merry devils who , after smashing the glass , had boldly ensconced themselves on the entablature of a window , and thence stared and jeered outside and inside in turn at the crowd in the hall and the crowd in the place outside
this was to push back the slaves curious to see their master , so that he should not be overwhelmed by their numbers and inconvenienced by their smell
how could he make quasimodo recognize him ?
the great hall was now just a vast furnace of shameless merriment , where every mouth was a shout , every eye a sparkle , every face a grimace , every individual a posture
what a terrible child , said the mother , smiling and scolding at the same time
let the spider get on with it !
how is she to be saved ?
the base of the triangle rested on the far end of the square , so as to block the rue du parvis ; one side faced the hôtel-dieu , the other the rue saint-pierre-aux-bœufs
they were a man and a woman
they won ’ t recognize his rights either as justiciary or over the highways
some of them were peeling bloody strips of material from their legs
he ventured a delicate question
there it is , he said , let us begin !
others walked about excitedly ; some were as pale as if they had been waiting for their own execution
he had observed temperatures , soils , stars , planted at the winter solstice , inspected the slaves , taken care over their clothes
don ’ t say that name !
the sick groaned on dromedaries ; others limped along , supported on the stump of a pike
if i had understood i should have hastened to you : i would have abandoned the army ; i would never have left carthage
jehan , accept your punishment at your master ’ s discretion
it was a city formed of two strata only , the romanesque and the gothic , for the roman stratum had long since disappeared , except for julian ’ s baths , where it still broke through the thick medieval crust
it was the month of schebaz , in mid-winter
amid this pile of houses one could also make out , by the tall , open-work stone mitres on the roof itself which then crowned the topmost windows of palaces , the hôtel given by the town , under charles vi , to juvénal des ursins ; a little further on the tarred sheds of the marché-palus ; elsewhere again the new apse of saint-germain-le-vieux , extended in number by taking in a bit from the rue-aux-febves ; and then , here and there , a crossroads thronged with people , a pillory standing at a street corner , a fine section of philip-augustus pavement , magnificent flagstones scored in the middle to stop horses ’ hooves slipping , and so poorly replaced in the sixteenth century by those wretched cobbles known as league paving ’ , a deserted backyard with one of those transparent staircases they used to build in the fifteenth century , one of which can still be seen in the rue des bourdonnais
clopin intervened , your name , rogue , and no more
they had been called out against carthage , and now they were going away from it !
what does this fellow think he ’ s doing ?
monsieur , the girl said , will they be going on ?
before he endowed a mass for st john , the king should have found out whether the worthy st john enjoys latin chanted with a provençal accent
mouldy cheese into the bargain !
then , he was so hard of hearing that he did not catch a word of what the clerk said ; however , he wanted to give the impression that he had heard , and replied : aha !
if i wish to see them !
this conclusive remark seemed to dispel all doubts in the mind of gringoire and other sceptics in the audience
i ’ m going back there—by the way , where ’ s that little student jehan who had all that scrap-iron round him ?
the hosier , despite the signals that guillaume rym was sending him , appeared determined to stand up to the king
the priest , who was heaping gestures of anger and rebuke on the deaf man , bade him with a violent sign to withdraw
among the hundreds of faces stained scarlet by this glow , there was one which seemed even more absorbed than all the others in contemplating the dancer
and he signed the sentence thus modified
every time that young viper goes past my cell , she makes my blood curdle !
if instead of characteristic monuments like those we have just mentioned we examine the general picture of architecture from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century , we observe the same phenomenon of decline and emaciation
besides , you know that a priest of eschmoûn is watching the cruel stars around the dog from which your illness derives
her pretty djali followed her
that ’ s odd , the priest said thoughtfully
outside the infantry , near the velites , he placed the clibanarii , beyond them the numidians ; when day broke both sides were thus drawn up face to face
he hastened off with the veterans
i saw her when she was only four months old
at once furious resistance began
non timebo millia populi circumdantis me : exsurge , domine ; salvum me fac , deus !
pinker than the satin shoes !
gringoire returned her caresses
and who would command them ?
that serves him right , said robert poussepain , who still bore a grudge againt quasimodo ; that will teach him to be rough with people
mâtho pulled them to the rear
the old trull with her white whiskers won ’ t give me credit
he had been seen along the gulf with the mercenaries , by the lagoon with the numidians , on the lake shore with the negroes , and from the end of the plain he drove on masses of soldiers who came up unceasingly against the lines of fortifications
there were gauls on the eridanus who needed a push , canaanites at cyrene who would have come , and while the romans send ambassadors to ptolemy… ’
he added , with an effort : a woman who loves you
when they find me in that cell , got up so grotesquely in skirt and coif , perhaps they ’ ll just roar with laughter
the child smiled , dazzled by such splendour , and growing bolder he was even beginning to clap his hands and jump about when hamilcar led him off
it is still the pantheon in the parthenon , st peter ’ s , rome
but tanit is your enemy , spendius replied : she is persecuting you , and you are dying from her anger
every eye remained riveted there , and the new arrivals , their cursed names , their faces , and their costumes constituted a continual distraction
those stars are worlds too
back there , master ’ ; and throwing off the veils she rubbed her face with her sleeve ; the dark colour , the servile trembling , the bent back , all disappeared
yes , it is me !
he had himself taken to the baths , and called for his cooks
she opened her eyes , and saw the gaunt arm of the stone gibbet stretched out above her head
formidable shouts of derision broke out from the barbarian troops , and spendius , mounted on his dromedary , cried : ha !
they went forward slowly , because of their enormous weight
then they went back to the pay slaves and started killing again
her eyes were just visible beneath her half-closed lids
the blazing sun came down hot on bare heads
he would have sacrificed twenty times more for such an enterprise to succeed
a sort of idiot grin uncovered his pale gums ; his great wild eyes looked at the crowd of barbarians around him
we must admire and ceaselessly leaf through the book written by architecture ; but we must not deny the grandeur of the building raised in its turn by printing
he would have driven her mad
the birds were already singing , a cold wind blew , little clouds scudded across the paling sky
i am a wretch , viler than scorpions , viler than mud and dust !
it took much trouble and much patience before claude frollo managed to teach him to talk
so the witch girl escaped !
three hours later he was still plunged in the cinnamon oil with which the bath had been filled ; and as he bathed , he ate , on a stretched out ox hide , flamingo tongues with poppy seed seasoned with honey
you ’ re very kind , messieurs the sergeants , i love you all
they went up slowly , and as the smoke swirled away in high eddies , they seemed from a distance to be disappearing into a cloud
if the witch is still in notre-dame , should she be seized there in spite of the asylum ?
he was in touch with only two things in the world , notre-dame and claude frollo
at his first distant sight of this mule and this priest the poor victim ’ s face softened , the fury contracting it gave way to a strange smile , full of ineffable gentleness , docility , and affection
perhaps he chose the day ?
the bewildered , unfortunate girl seemed to have lost all sight and reason within the dark interior of the church
pour all your sound out into the square
brother , jehan has treated your gracious counsels like straw and dung to be trampled underfoot
you are suffering , aren ’ t you ?
he made a tour of the cell
the king ’ s good humour , ever since he had been informed of the revolt against the bailiff , came through in everything
in silence they reached the rue des bernardins , which was more or less deserted
then the men in red mantles intoned the sacred hymn
there ’ s one over in the shed at the maison-aux-piliers , the man answered
the stranger did not answer a word
to limit ourselves to the cell in the tour-roland , we have to say that it had never been short of recluses
can any sweeter pleasure be imagined than that of passing sentence and judgement , as messire robert d ’ estouteville did every day in the grand châtelet , beneath philip-augustus ’ s broad , flattened arches ?
i feel quite robust
there still remained sixty of them
there he is dismounting ! —he ’ s about to go into that house ! —phoebus ! —he can ’ t hear me !
he added , with hands clasped together , bells , don ’ t bell !
and paid for from the tax on salt-water fish sold in the paris market , what ’ s more !
the water was flowing imperceptibly on to the terrace and hamilcar , extraordinarily enough , did not seem concerned about it
it grew still darker
with some difficulty quasimodo managed to recognize in the man the handsome captain , and in the woman the young lady whom he had seen that morning , welcoming the officer from that very same balcony
it was an image of truth , the very spirit of his words
bit of old rag , she muttered , and , turning to gringoire : let ’ s see your cape !
far from damping down her mystic desires , he excited them , and even seemed to delight in grieving her by the revelations of a merciless doctrine
and i was all those things before , monsieur , king of tunis , for i am a philosopher : and omnia in philosophic , omnes in philosopho continentur [ all things are contained in philosophy , all men in the philosopher ] , as you know
do not be upset !
anyone would think that woman has upset you !
first filed past the priests of the pataeci gods , then those of eschmoûn , those of melkarth and all the other colleges in succession , with the same insignia and in the same order as they had observed for the sacrifice
in cathedrals it was , as it were , another cathedral underground , low , dark , mysterious , blind and dumb , beneath the upper nave flooded with light and resounding day and night with organ and bells ; sometimes it was a sepulchre
sometimes , when a bearded vulture , perched on a corpse , had been tearing it up for a long time , a man would begin crawling towards it with a javelin in his teeth
it was the jackals coming to eat up the remains
he had remained kneeling , hands folded as though in prayer , attentive , scarcely breathing , eyes fixed steadily on the gypsy ’ s shining pupils
but once the lecture was over he none the less calmly resumed his lawless and outrageous ways
when it was full of blood they plunged their arms into it
gringoire himself was not far from finding the whole business frightening and probable
i tell you she ’ s my daughter !
architecture came back from the crusades with the pointed arch , as the nations did with their freedom
at the last moment everything could have been saved : there was no need to flee
he will go mad !
misfortune should help to make us cleverer
he was dressed in rags , and was walking with one knee bent and the foot dragging
hamilcar did not worry about it
he leaned panting against the wall to keep himself from falling
i am a wretch !
come of it what may , i ’ ll go to my brother
gringoire had scarcely raised to his lips this heady cup of joy and triumph when a dash of bitterness was mixed into it
master , one day you will enter carthage , between the colleges of the pontiffs , and they will kiss your sandals : and if tanit ’ s veil still weighs on you , you can put it back in her temple
being a robber doesn ’ t make you a jew
the men from the parliament will be properly caught tomorrow when they come to fetch her !
he seized his head , and resting it on his knee sawed at it rapidly ; it fell ; two great jets of blood made a hole in the dust
then they advanced like swirls of sand raised by the wind
at dawn and at dusk prowlers sometimes roamed along the walls
taanach , i wish i could dissolve in my prayers like a flower in wine !
the routed escort galloped at his side
they stopped for a moment in front of this body of soldiers massed around the rat-hole , gazed in amazement , and went on their way
but strange cries , at once hoarse and shrill , could be heard in the room , above hanno ’ s voice and the clattering of the dishes being set round him
that ’ s treating epidaurus and chaldea very summarily , replied the doctor with a sneer
but so great was the rage driving them that they rushed upon it
by then , poor chantefleurie , she was fair game for anyone
i have a particular devotion to saint-eustache
more from astonishment than pity , no doubt , they were allowed to finish the dish
there are signs everywhere of the day after a public holiday
we could boil him alive at the marché-aux-pourceaux before he said anything
and he ’ s a kind king too !
he thought that some plot was being hatched against the unfortunate refugee
how intently you are looking at that officer !
no doubt , looking at these two bibles so widely open through the centuries , one may be permitted to regret the loss of the visible majesty of that granite writing , those gigantic alphabets formulated as colonnades , pylons , and obelisks , those man-made mountains , as it were , covering the earth and the past from the pyramid to the steeple , from cheops to strasbourg
that ’ s a trade you can always take up when you are a vagrant , and it ’ s better than stealing , as some of my larcenous young friends advised me to do
do not ask hindu , egyptian , romanesque masonry for a corrected design or improved statuary
then he secretly accused the rabbet of his life ’ s misfortune
the wretched man repeated
( gringoire had known that since the beginning of winter )
what have you done with my phoebus ?
that ’ s not up to much !
he added , looking around : where is she ?
one step outside the sanctuary and he fell back into the water
gisco spread out the syssitia accounts , entered in violet paint on sheepskin ; he read out everything that had come into carthage , month by month , and day by day
a gentleman holding the king ’ s commission with letters of appointment going back to the time of the marriage of louis xi ’ s natural daughter to the bastard of bourbon was something wondrous in number the same day that robert d ’ estouteville had replaced jacques de villiers as provost of paris , maître jean dauvet replaced messire hèlye de thorettes as first president of the court of parliament , jean jouvenel des ursins supplanted pierre de morvilliers in the office of chancellor of france , regnault des dormans relieved pierre puy of the post of master of requests in ordinary in the king ’ s household
it was believed to be born of the earth ’ s clay , since it emerges from the earth ’ s depths and does not need feet to move over it ; its progress recalled the rippling of rivers , its temperature the ancient , viscous darkness full of fertility , and the circle it describes , as it bites its own tail , the planetary system , eschmoûn ’ s intelligence
number livres number sols number deniers !
then they risked themselves in the water channel
the two armies , emerging from their tents , watched ; the people of utica pressed on to the ramparts for a better view
captain phoebus de châteaupers , you are lying !
maybe they ’ ll hang you , but she ’ ll be saved
so saying , he threw , deft as a monkey , a small coin into the greasy hat that the beggar held out with his affected arm
don ’ t rot away like an illiterate donkey on the straw of the lecture-room floor
he could not help shaking his head sorrowfully
do you persist in your denial ?
the reprisals after such a murderous attack would be fearful
justice at that time was very little concerned with precision and propriety in criminal trials
some , their temples transfixed by a javelin , swayed their heads like bears
in the hollow tread-wheels men could be seen going up rung by rung
asked the archdeacon , fixing a penetrating stare on coictier ’ s companion
un cofre de gran riqueza
unfortunately hardly anything remains of these monuments in which gothic art drew the line so precisely between riches and economy
they were no longer afraid
he approached them on tiptoe , and heard the archdeacon say in a very low voice to charmolue : it was guillaume de paris who had a job carved on that lapis-lazuli coloured stone , with gilded edges
he had had her after the death of several male children
he sometimes questioned her about her journey to the mercenaries ’ camp
do whatever you like !
but there was no longer a rope round her neck , her hands were no longer bound
he was rubbing his hands together and laughing with that inward laughter which makes the face beam
she was not very tall , but her slim figure stood so boldly straight that she seemed to be so
the students , pressing at the window , greeted them as they passed by with sarcastic sallies and ironic applause
learned doctor , i make mock of learning ; gentleman , i besmirch my name ; priest , i use the missal as a pillow for lust , i spit in the face of my god !
the carthaginians shut themselves up inside ; they did not move out again
he made one more effort with trouillefou
and i come to you , brother , with a heart full of contrition
what do you want with me ?
a bird ’ s-eye view of paris
let me run away !
business is bad enough as it is !
suddenly he heard the boards of the wooden staircase creaking
salammbo rapidly recoiled , she was so afraid of this loathsome creature , hideous as a mask and terrible as a phantom
do you love me ?
there was only one entrance , a modern door , set in a surbased arch , furnished on the inside with a tapestry , and on the outside with one of those irish wood porches , frail structures of curiously worked joinery , which one could still see a hundred and fifty years ago in many old houses
it was filled with much noise and many people
hosier is fine enough !
the men , on the contrary , were delighted and applauded
then they turned their desire on to the wounded and sick
non cuiquam datum est habere nasum [ it is not given to everyone to have a nose ] —you ’ re truly divine , jacqueline ronge-oreille !
from françois ii to louis xv the disease has grown worse in geometrical progression
the numidian king arrived in hamilcar ’ s tent ; and he said , pointing to his men who had stopped still at a distance :
they made him drink some wine , and he wept ; then he burst out in a torrent of words
i must have a very eleemosynary look about me for anyone to ask for my charity with my purse as lean as it is
independently of the missiles that he had piled up on the balustrade , he had built up a heap of stones on the platform itself
this priest was the archdeacon , dom claude frollo
i show the girl and the captain to the upstairs room , and i leave them on their own , that is , with the goat
they imagined that the republic was always trying to deceive them
it ’ s the gypsy who escaped
in india , vyasa is complex , strange , impenetrable as a pagoda
the poor mother poured out in streams over this adored hand the deep , black well of tears within her , into which all her grief had filtered drop by drop for fifteen years
then , when they happened to lift their heads and look at each other , they choked with sobs as they discovered how horribly ravaged their faces were
there , i know who he is , said one ; he ’ s maître andry musnier
soon they stumbled and had to swim
let us come back to the façade of notre-dame , as it still appears at the present day , when we go piously to admire the solemn and mighty cathedral which , according to its chroniclers , inspires terror : quae mole sua terrorem incutit spectantibus [ which by its mass strikes spectators with terror ]
he came up , went away , and , constantly renewing this manoeuvre , gradually detached them from their camps
that ’ s the clerk to the court of parliament
gringoire said to himself with a sigh , the others are listening
then , as she stayed still , he cried out to ask what she wanted
and then , claude went on shrewdly , what sort of children ’ s clothes are going to cost number florins ?
then he stiffened and said : oh !
spendius was obliged to follow them ; mâtho in the end gave way likewise
when he came out at daybreak , his interpreters , who slept outside , did not stir ; they lay on their backs , eyes staring , tongues protruding , faces blue
[ popular revelry of a people revelling !
and the girl , not even properly dressed
phoebus ! —how unkind of that woman to speak to him at the same time as me ! —phoebus !
i admit , answered mahiette , that it ’ s only in paris that you see flemings like that
they had lost their way
he saw clearly again into his soul , and shuddered
every night she goes up on the terrace of her palace , doesn ’ t she ?
this for-l ’ evêque had a charming fourteenth-century chapel with an apse giving on to the street
in any case i hoped that a new impression would wipe out the original one , and that first impression had become unbearable
it was much worse when the king ’ s attorney emptied on to the floor a certain leather pouch full of movable letters which djali wore round her neck , and they saw the goat pull out with her hoof from the scattered alphabet the fateful name : phoebus
the military accounts were handed over to the captains , read out to the soldiers , definitely approved
quasimodo then looked up at the gypsy , whose body he could see in the distance , hanging from the gibbet , shuddering in her white dress in the last twitches of the death agony , then he looked down again at the archdeacon stretched out at the foot of the tower , no longer in human shape , and said with a sob that made his deep chest heave : oh !
the man on the tower at saint-gervais has just called out half-past one in the morning
there ’ s also a pleasant garden , consisting of a pond , an aviary , an echo , a mall , a maze , a wild animal house , and a good many leaf-shaded walks most agreeable to venus
as spendius looked at him , he recalled the young men who used to beseech him , jars of gold in their hands , when he paraded his band of harlots through towns ; he was moved with pity , and said :
art , however , took giant strides
then spendius had pigs collected from the farms , smeared them with pitch , set light to it and drove them towards utica
he lived in one of the pearl-edged carthaginian tents , drank cool drinks from silver cups , played cottabus , let his hair grow and conducted the siege without haste
suddenly she stretched out her wan skinny hand towards the child who looked at her in amazement : take that child away !
they mended their weapons , greased their hair , or washed their bloody arms in the sea ; the tents were closed ; the pack animals fed ; and in the distance , the sickles on the chariots , all drawn up in a semicircle , looked like a silver scimitar stretching out at the base of the mountains
all that time you have enjoyed the warmth of the sun
meanwhile the other did not stir
you all heard the horrible threats of this man !
their services , the price of their blood , as they call it !
what are they doing there , i ask you ?
thus he saw what the priest was looking at
my poor dear little child !
it will enable you to find your mother again
give me back my little agnès !
it ’ s your fault if it ’ s a bad law
the town had the halles , the city the hôtel-dieu , the university the pré-aux-clercs
the virgins of the great families were brought up to respect these fetters as something almost religious , and salammbo flushed as she rolled round her legs the two broken bits of the golden chain
go to your appointment , the stranger went on
a movement of terror went through the crowd
sometimes he ’ s dressed in a fine golden robe figured in the turkish fashion
after some debate , venus , marguerite , and those in the wings had agreed to abide by the judgement of the holy virgin
but the carthaginian army , a force of , men , seemed scarcely to contain them , for it formed a long rectangle , narrow on the flanks and tightly compressed
have you ever seen anyone put in the pillory , my dear mahiette ?
i came to look at you sleeping
do you recognize this weapon ?
where have you got to in latin humanities ?
the striker used both arms ; as the thongs swished they made the bark fly from the plane-trees
tristan l ’ hermite , do you hear ?
go on , then , the provost went on
women slept outside the cells , stretched out on mats
let your general give it to you !
it is hamilcar burning autharitus ’ camp !
he laid them down at hamilcar ’ s feet , put in his hands a wooden frame fitted with three inner wires with beads on them of gold , silver , and horn , and began :
a tear for a drop of water
what do you think of her , fair cousin ?
as her inner wounds healed , so her grace and beauty flowered again on her face , but more thoughtful now and calmer
he was in the grip of a strange fear : every minute he kept drinking large cups of water
salammbo gasped beneath this weight , too heavy for her , her back bent , she felt she was dying ; and with the tip of its tail it gently flicked her thigh ; then as the music ceased , it dropped down again
when i ’ m with you , my phoebus !
but what should happen but that maître coppenole , the hosier , suddenly stands up , and gringoire hears him deliver , amid the attention of all , this abominable harangue :
it ’ s going to strike seven
then it seemed to the carthaginians that their fatherland , abandoning its walls , was coming to bid them die for it
then the yelling , ragged procession moved off on the traditional inner circuit of the galleries of the palais before parading through the streets and crossroads
a pretty creature , upon my soul , that dancer is !
gradually , however , the first vapours of fear cleared away ; the noise , constantly increasing , and several other signs of reality , made her realize that her besiegers were not spectres but human beings
to subjugate the kings of the firmament to the sun and stop their particular influences from disturbing his , stars of variously coloured metal were brandished on the end of long poles ; and they were all to be found there , from black nebo , spirit of mercury , to hideous rahab , which is the crocodile constellation
melkarth ’ s pavilion , of fine purple , sheltered a petroleum flame ; on that of khamon , hyacinth in colour , rose an ivory phallus , with a ring of jewels encircling it ; between eschmoûn ’ s curtains , blue as the ether , a sleeping python coiled its tail in a circle ; and the pataeci gods , held in their priests ’ arms , looked like great swaddled infants , whose heels brushed the ground
the half-light came in through the narrow slits , and broken chains could be seen hanging on the walls inside
here in short is what it ’ s all about
three cheers for pleasure !
but architecture will no longer be the social , the collective , the dominant art
this huge black obelisk thus isolated between the two white sheets of sky and river , very broad at that spot , made a peculiar impression on dom claude , comparable to that which a man would experience if he were to îie on the ground , on his back , at the foot of the steeple of strasbourg and look up at the huge spire above his head plunging into the shadowy twilight
in the middle of the isthmus the throng halted , as the mercenaries positioned in front of them , near the walls , would not move
some who were not wounded stayed motionless , stiffer than stakes , with mouths wide open and arms outstretched
the leading barbarians were marching in the dust of the carthaginians
i recognize her by her goat
at times too he riveted his gaze on the holes in his doublet , in order to cling to reality and not completely to lose contact with the earth
the captain felt very sheepish about it
the tall , fair young man took a step back , but the two girls were curious and did not want to let him go
the gypsies stole her from me , they hid her from me for fifteen years
the elders did not want to provide any , thinking such an effort pointless ; others , who had gone off without a general , had been massacred
do you see , daughter of egypt ?
but with that a certain bitterness had mingled with such sweet pleasures
he threw up opposite utica a long rectangular earthwork
the priest was vehement
he arrived at the bottom of the mappalia , and tried to scale the cliff
he spread out his arms ; spendius , with a slipknot , tied him by the wrists : someone else knocked him over , and he disappeared amid the unruly mob collapsing on the sacks
she fixed her eyes on him : away with you , demon !
let ’ s go on down , take our big brother ’ s wallet and convert all these coins into bottles !
i am going back to carthage
for dom claude the last word had been spoken on this earth
said the gypsy , for whom these words revived memories of the scene at the pillory
however , somehing huge continued to come on
this was the house built by nicolas flamel , where he had died in about number , and which , empty ever since , was already beginning to fall into ruin , thanks to all the hermetics and alchemists of every land who had worn away the walls just by carving their names upon them
tristan l ’ hermite bowed and went out
by the rood sire !
directly in front of notre-dame three streets debouched on to the parvis , a fine square of old houses
monsieur , it ’ s the custom
it was then that i terrified you when we met
every day a new course is added
there would have been punches you could hear out in the street !
all that remained on the wall were the delicate fleurs-de-lys , intertwined with rose bushes , painted in number by mathurin biterne
said gringoire , stunned , in the midst of all his emotions , at how suddenly that magic word knitted together all his memories of that day
you scoff at the provostship , you wretch !
meanwhile the captain , swearing the while like a saracen , hastened to make the sun shine on a gold piece ’ as our admirable régnier puts it
the soldiers , without suspecting that they were being cheated , accepted the syssitia accounts as correct
this meant vowing oneself to the god , offering oneself as a holocaust
there was a white robe with a white veil
the archdeacon , as he remarked all round the choir the pallid tips of these lancets , thought he was seeing the mitres of bishops consigned to damnation
he continued , pointing to the stone gibbet
just look how i eat !
between la courtille and saint-laurent , on the summit of some high ground squatting above the empty plains , your eye had already noticed a structure of some sort , looking from a distance like a ruined colonnade standing on an exposed base
in the midst of the servants and pedlars women of every nation circulated , brown as ripe dates , sallow as olives , yellow as oranges , sold by sailors , chosen from hovels , stolen from caravans , taken at the capture of towns , worn out by love-making while they were young , constantly beaten when they were old , dying by the roadside in retreats , among the baggage , with the abandoned pack animals
in the fateful cart sat a girl , arms bound behind her back , but no priest beside her
the windows closed again forthwith , and the poor burghers , who had scarcely had time to cast an appalled glance on this scene of flaring lights and uproar , went back to îie sweating with fear beside their wives , wondering if the witches ’ sabbath was being held now in the parvis notre-dame , or if the burgundians were attacking as in ’ number
