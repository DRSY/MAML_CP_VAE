the rain of the preceding day had not , as yet , entirely run off , and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom , and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water
a hasty rush troubled the deserted street ; they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus , and gavroche bounded into the barricade , all breathless , saying : -my gun !
these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly ; hence life and death
les bonapartistes a la lanterne !
what a fierce old fellow !
tis a book of pierre lombard , the master of sentences
it cut more often short
the reader will , perhaps , recall the critical situation in which we left quasimodo
young men have such bad taste nowadays !
the sound of the latch roused him
before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery , the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder , without uttering a word , seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands , raised them , pushed them out from the wall , balanced the long and pliant ladder , loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment , in the midst of shrieks of anguish , then suddenly , with superhuman force , hurled this cluster of men backward into the place
the porter 's lodge was closed
he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table , turned the chisel in the brazier , set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish , then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope , and bent down as though to examine something
it was high time
monsieur , said the clerk , do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning
the abyss is subject to these treacheries
nevertheless , he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong and earnest character
he had passed lillois and bois-seigneur-isaac
this spectacle had a terror of its own
for in his own mind , he agreed with the restoration , and like it , did not recognize his father 's claim to the title of either colonel or baron
as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil , he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan , depositing a burden on the ground , then taking it up and setting out again
these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive
jean valjean began by committing a blunder
or on his knees , said rym
they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front
hardly had the light been extinguished , when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay
he plunged to his heart ’ s content in evil thoughts , and in proportion as he sank deeper , he felt a satanic laugh burst forth within him
he kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile , and very worthy of care
filled is exactly the word ; certainly the bishop 's day was quite full to the brim , of good words and good deeds
when he had advanced fifty paces , he was obliged to halt
this gave each man fifteen rounds to fire
to have succeeded only in stretching her upon the leather bed !
he did not understand in the least , and opened it
perhaps this was only a rough draft
it was he who possessed the wit
in the bride 's trap
i shall call her catherine , she said
the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys
i am the poet whose morality was presented this morning in the grand hall of the courts
it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously , and who was now bowing to the earth before him
of all , an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention , and from which he had not yet recovered , had added to his state of alarm
he took a fold of cosette 's sleeve and kissed it
i do not blame the law , but i bless god
he had before him that deaf and implacable house , six stories in height , which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window ; he had on his right the rather low barricade , which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie ; to pass this obstacle seemed easy , but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible
javert gazed at m madeleine with his candid eyes , in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible , and said in a tranquil voice : -mr mayor , i can not grant you that
it sometimes happens that , even contrary to principles , even contrary to liberty , equality , and fraternity , even contrary to the universal vote , even contrary to the government , by all for all , from the depths of its anguish , of its discouragements and its destitutions , of its fevers , of its distresses , of its miasmas , of its ignorances , of its darkness , that great and despairing body , the rabble , protests against , and that the populace wages battle against , the people
it has its buttercups and its daisies ; the grass is tall there ; the cart-horses browse there ; cords of hair , on which linen is drying , traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head ; one walks over this uncultivated land , and one 's foot dives into mole-holes
suppose a case : i am a traveller ; i say to the diligence , i will go on in advance ; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass
there are fathers who do not love their children ; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson
he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall , for fear of alarming her
let us inform ourselves of the trap
during the second year , precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached , it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted , without marius himself being quite aware why , and nearly six months elapsed , during which he did not set foot in the alley
she did not wake
and then , to face the worst , there was danger only for himself , and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys
besides this , the monarchy sometimes was in need of children , and in that case it skimmed the streets
he loved books ; books are cold but safe friends
the words passive obedience indicate this
is there , then , no way of forcing this door , exclaimed the king of thunes , stamping his foot
for the people against the people , that is the question
he resembled them too much for that
it had happened to him to hold his own against m de bonald , and even against m bengy-puy-vallee
we have arms , but there is no work !
he dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows , always in flower ; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out , loaded with birds , in the tufts of the saxon capitals ; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church ; of no other ocean than paris , roaring at their bases
that i will explain to you
they could see nothing remarkable about it , except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver , for they were hall-marked , an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns
was that he was also accompanied by the provost of paris and the chevalier of the watch , who appeared to be in consternation
he inquired of him : -what does hercle mean ?
each man had taken up his position for the conflict
it even struck him that the aged cynic , as he hobbled along past him , addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink , as though some chance had created an understanding between them , and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together
in the midst of his torments , and long before this , he had discontinued his work , and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work ; it is a habit which vanishes
you saved my life , said the man
waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century
every good quality tends towards a defect ; economy borders on avarice , the generous man is next door to the prodigal , the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart ; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted ; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in diogenes ' cloak
the gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively
the two little ones followed mechanically , holding each other by the hand
the one who was in advance was trying to get away , the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other
a sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality , and that they feel , even among thinkers and dreamers , some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of
i get down at vernon , in order to take the branch coach for gaillon
the result of this council held by the watch dogs was , that they had been mistaken , that there had been no noise , that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer , that it would only be a waste of time , but that they ought to hasten towards saint-merry ; that if there was anything to do , and any bousingot to track out , it was in that quarter
then he said to himself : but this signifies nothing ; there is nothing written here
retorted the boy , where 's my father ?
i was obliged to renounce the profession of author
however , apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch , boulatruelle put things together and made calculations

all the young girls raised their eyes
each creature had his pasture or his mess

the crowd hurled itself towards them , and they already beheld the frail wooden railing , which separated them from it , giving way and bending before the pressure of the throng
father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting
the big girl approached and laid her hand in her father 's
hence he took great care to conceal his deafness from the eyes of all , and he generally succeeded so well that he had reached the point of deluding himself , which is , by the way , easier than is supposed
bury a crown to unearth a sou !
two large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride , the first for m gillenormand , the other for jean valjean
by a good distribution , not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood
a woman with gray hair said to us : i was there
in order to extricate himself from the predicament , he took the simplest course ; he lied abominably
the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half-filled by a fence of rotten boards , shored up by five stone posts
the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones , and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
the immensity of night was facing this tiny creature
this book was on one of the upper shelves
and then , gringoire held the position of her brother , if not of her husband
montparnasse watched him with amazement , as he disappeared in the dusk
these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony
he found dom claude greatly changed ; pale as a winter ’ s morning , with hollow eyes , and hair almost white
i offer you a cutlet and you answer me : by the way , i want to marry
my friends , long live women !
but in proportion as his youth disappeared , gayety was kindled ; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries , his hair with mirth , his health with irony , his weeping eye laughed incessantly
i like this better , said m gillenormand
he said to himself with a sort of joy that -- it was certainly the least he could do ; that it was an expiation ; -- that , had it not been for that , he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father , and such a father !
there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing
cosette drew from the envelope its contents , a little notebook of paper , each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting , as cosette thought
at every blow dealt by the formidable rabbi , from the depths of his cell , upon this nail , that one of his enemies whom he had condemned , were he a thousand leagues away , was buried a cubit deep in the earth which swallowed him
a word was sufficient for him , sometimes a sign ; the mastodon obeyed
if you succeed in removing the purse without our hearing the bells , you are a vagabond , and you will be thrashed for eight consecutive days
the streets were invested , the church backed on the river
and he offered the two newspapers , unfolded , to marius , the reader is acquainted with these two papers
was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist , and who would come to visit his butterfly ?
if your majesty does not send prompt succor to the bailiff , he is lost
his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light
without doubt , this strange beacon light would awaken far away , the woodcutter of the hills of bicêtre , terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre-dame quivering over his heaths
then there would be an unpleasant scene ; a recrudescence of family questions , a confrontation of positions , every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time , fauchelevent , coupelevent , fortune , poverty , a stone about his neck , the future
i can bear the comparison !
it was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child , not yet six years old , shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen , full of holes , sweeping the street before daylight , with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands , and a tear in her great eyes
thus it will be easily understood that that grating , so obligingly opened to jean valjean , was a bit of cleverness on thenardier 's part
what was it that he did ?
she was conscious of marius ' will in the direction of monsieur jean , she conformed to it
he appeared to have grown thin and pale
what shall i do until then ?
it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard , when they ran short of children , took those who had fathers
at the same time , a sort of pale , thin , small , freckled , and youthful artisan , clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet , and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man , emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman 's voice : -monsieur marius , if you please
sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher 's shop on the corner , in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him , an awkward young man , carrying big books under his arm , who had a timid yet angry air , who , on entering , removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration , made a profound bow to the butcher 's astonished wife , asked for a mutton cutlet , paid six or seven sous for it , wrapped it up in a paper , put it under his arm , between two books , and went away
my soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas
a few moments later , the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents , who had taken refuge at the top of the house

have a care , nemorin , thou art too handsome !
fantine , by appearing thus abruptly in his revery , produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light ; it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect : he exclaimed : -ah !
she told herself that she was not sure of anything , that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost ; and the idea that marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful
and she began to pace up and down with long strides before the grating of her window , her hair dishevelled , her eyes flashing , with her shoulder striking against the wall , with the wild air of a female wolf in a cage , who has long been famished , and who feels the hour for her repast drawing near
the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm , the others turned away , each according to his nature
fantine had become terrible
volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth
they say she is a sorceress , and that her goat executes very miraculous tricks
the little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing
did those thenardiers keep her clean ?
then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking , moving , becoming endued with animation , that it was alive ; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw , which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula , and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious elephant , which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet , its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings
at that moment , a ragged child who was coming down through the rue menilmontant , holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville , caught sight of an old holster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-a-brac merchant 's shop
it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with laffitte , with this peculiar feature , that they were always at his immediate disposal , so that , it was added , m madeleine could make his appearance at laffitte 's any morning , sign a receipt , and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes
in a bee-line , through the underbrush , which is peculiarly dense , very thorny , and very aggressive in that locality , a full half hour was necessary

she refused the cake which mahiette offered to her , and said , black bread

the worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions , without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze
the good woman appeared as usual

mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him
his name was ultime fauchelevent
thus , -- and in the exaggeration of anguish , and the optical illusion of consternation , all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced , and society , and the human race , and the universe were , henceforth , summed up in his eyes , in one simple and terrible feature , -- thus the penal laws , the thing judged , the force due to legislation , the decrees of the sovereign courts , the magistracy , the government , prevention , repression , official cruelty , wisdom , legal infallibility , the principle of authority , all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security , sovereignty , justice , public truth , all this was rubbish , a shapeless mass , chaos ; he himself , javert , the spy of order , incorruptibility in the service of the police , the bull-dog providence of society , vanquished and hurled to earth ; and , erect , at the summit of all that ruin , a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow ; this was the astounding confusion to which he had come ; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul
one evening during that same month of april , jean valjean had gone out ; cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown
you were among them
; make him sing the marseillaise , and he will free the world
it was difficult to divine why
she went on , you have a hole in your shirt
to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds ?
the light fell full on m madeleine 's face
this is neither a fair nor a market day
a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face , burned and tanned by sun and wind , and dripping with perspiration
this was the idea : -it is barely midnight , the rue de l'homme arme is not far off ; i will go and deliver the letter at once , and i shall get back in time
a sudden light made them blink ; gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats
then , again , from time to time , this mass of sublime noises opens and gives passage to the beats of the ave maria , which bursts forth and sparkles like an aigrette of stars
not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim , except to jeer at his thirst
towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn , a man turned from the rue saint-antoine at a run , made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july , and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant
louis philippe having been severely judged by some , harshly , perhaps , by others , it is quite natural that a man , himself a phantom at the present day , who knew that king , should come and testify in his favor before history ; this deposition , whatever else it may be , is evidently and above all things , entirely disinterested ; an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere ; one shade may console another shade ; the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it ; it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile : this one flattered the other
only , a civilizing people should remain a manly people

the coachman drew up in front of the carters ' inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey , to give his horses a breathing spell
said he , have no more fear of me than i have for you !
but then , why had he permitted that man to leave him alive ?
then his fears returned to him , the idea of an attempt against the gypsy presented itself once more to his mind
nevertheless , there was one human creature whom quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others , and whom he loved even more , perhaps , than his cathedral : this was claude frollo
we are at the top ; let us have a superior philosophy
the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze
that done , she laid it in her arms , and sang to it softly , to lull it to sleep
the plateau of mont-saint-jean was captured , recaptured , captured again
she was , on the contrary , somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual
what we are doing is not wholly innocent
when facts , the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady , move heavily , the slightest complication stops and entangles them
to have taken her from me thus ; you could never have looked at me with her , when i was joyously warming her at my fire , when she laughed as she suckled , when i made her tiny feet creep up my breast to my lips ?

the rue plumet , the rue plumet , did you say ? -- let us see ! -- are there not barracks in that vicinity ? -- why , yes , that 's it
and without the mother even having seen her child once more , almost without the child 's having known her mother ; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who , most assuredly , has deserved the galleys for something else , if not for that ; fine scruples , indeed , which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent , which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most , and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel , and which sacrifice a whole population , mothers , wives , children
the circling dances of the numberth of july effaced the enthusiasms of the numberth of march
amen , said fauchelevent , who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma , whenever he heard latin
her person seemed made of a shadow ; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex ; a little matter enclosing a light ; large eyes forever drooping ; -- a mere pretext for a soul 's remaining on the earth
aumarais lane was called maugout lane ; the rue droit-mur was called the rue des eglantiers , for god opened flowers before man cut stones
he placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger , crossed his arms and said : -i am the one to pay !
but there might have been some one there
although a bourgeois , m gillenormand was received in society
they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house
that gypsy girl you know , who comes every day to dance on the church square , in spite of the official ’ s prohibition !
the smile was still mingled with it for a time , but was bitter , discouraged , profoundly sad

this what i wanted to say ; i could not find words for it at first

that which we admire above all , in an encounter of the nature of waterloo , is the marvellous cleverness of chance

this was the situation of marius ' mind
this species of weather-vane which looked upon the pavement was the signboard
neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment
i tell you , sir , that the end of the world has come
then he added : perhaps my thoughts reach her also
joy never , ecstasy forever
the most puzzled were the school-master and thenardier , the proprietor of the tavern , who was everybody 's friend , and had not disdained to ally himself with boulatruelle
it was mistaken ; it formed a part of the past , but the whole past was france
item , one must live !
are not her hands perfect ?
he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan
no light in the windows ; the shades were drawn ; the third floor was totally dark
no , replied the girl , but as his key is in the door , he must be out
the printed book , the gnawing worm of the edifice , sucks and devours it
the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul , and never of love , very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame
like him , she had a mustache
this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything
that he had thus two condemned creatures attached to him ; that his companion asked no better than to take charge of the gypsy
it 's i , said he
this should not be , gamins
i feel that her whole soul lies within it !

a little street , the rue du chemin-vert-saint-antoine , opened out between two timber-yards enclosed in walls

jean valjean loved to haunt these fields
he threw himself into one of the arm-chairs
the trousers would go next
he replied with some embarrassment : -ah !
thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts , he dropped his head

when he had , not without difficulty , repassed the fence , and found himself once more in the street , alone , without refuge , without shelter , without a roof over his head , chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel , he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone , and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim , i am not even a dog !

he had , nevertheless , received from his family some education and some politeness of manner ; but he had been thrown on the world too young , he had been in garrison at too early an age , and every day the polish of a gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his gendarme ’ s cross-belt

it will be remembered that the fundamental point in javert , his element , the very air he breathed , was veneration for all authority
isolation , detachment , from everything , pride , independence , the taste of nature , the absence of daily and material activity , the life within himself , the secret conflicts of chastity , a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation , had prepared marius for this possession which is called passion

phoebus , said fleur-de-lys suddenly , in a low voice , we are to be married three months hence ; swear to me that you have never loved any other woman than myself
then , in order to prevent cosette eating black bread , jean valjean ate white bread
recommended by the eighty francs , they were well cared for , as is everything from which profit is derived ; they were neither badly clothed , nor badly fed ; they were treated almost like little gentlemen , -- better by their false mother than by their real one
she tried to smile and could not
the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver
however , as we have just pointed out , brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom , or folly , or , as it often happens , in both at once , are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life
she licked the pavement
and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor
on the following day , which was the third , ma'am bougon was thunderstruck
this is what he thought : i am struck all of a heap
you know not what unhappiness is
he was too ugly
meanwhile , the lugubrious cavalcade has traversed the crowd amid cries of joy and curious attitudes
where do you live ?
now , to give the big bell in marriage to quasimodo was to give juliet to romeo
jean valjean , without replying , helped the insurgent whom he was saving to don his uniform
and then they have made it over ; a presumption of which neither time nor revolutions at least have been guilty
the supreme floating visions are abject
between eleven o'clock and midnight , you will come with your iron bar
still , i do not say -- you are rich ; you have the air of a very good man , -- if it were for her happiness
all those places which you no longer behold , which you may never behold again , perchance , and whose memory you have cherished , take on a melancholy charm , recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition , make the holy land visible to you , and are , so to speak , the very form of france , and you love them ; and you call them up as they are , as they were , and you persist in this , and you will submit to no change : for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother
the redoubt had been cleverly made over , into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside
for the one party , to advance meant death , and no one dreamed of retreating ; for the other , to remain meant death , and no one dreamed of flight
and now there 's the other one !
what do you want me to say to you ?
tis only necessary to be handsome on the outside !
meanwhile , the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold
finally , quite at the end of the room , near the door , in the dark , stood , motionless as a statue , a vigorous man with thickset limbs , a military harness , with a surcoat of armorial bearings , whose square face pierced with staring eyes , slit with an immense mouth , his ears concealed by two large screens of flat hair , had something about it both of the dog and the tiger
i am neither denounced , nor pursued , nor tracked , you say
good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones
she is my sister , she answered
from that moment , master coppenole enjoyed in paris as in ghent , great favor with the people ; for men of that sort do enjoy it , says philippe de comines , when they are thus disorderly
she approached , without uttering a syllable , the victim who writhed in a vain effort to escape her , and detaching a gourd from her girdle , she raised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man
what we have just written seems strange , and yet it is true
collectors of petty details , who become herbalists of anecdotes , and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin , know that there was in paris , during the last century , about number , two attorneys at the chatelet named , one corbeau ( raven ) , the other renard ( fox )
it seemed to him too , that , in one instant , he had become deaf
you should have completed it when you conceived it
guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men
i am to nail up the coffin
now listen to this ; we have a good memory
his gnome ’ s eye , fastened upon her , inundated her with tenderness , sadness , and pity , and was suddenly raised filled with lightnings
she retreated into the crowd
the little girl with the goat
at the time of the insurrection of number , in the rue saint-martin a little , infirm old man , pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored rag , in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid , went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade , offering his glasses of cocoa impartially , -- now to the government , now to anarchy
my brother is so good
of course i shall give it to you , said the mother
a large , deep moat , with a brisk current during the high water of winter , bathed the base of the wall round paris ; the seine furnished the water
they also might descend into that well and search it
it is faithful , brave , chivalric , loving , devoted
i have bread enough for her and for myself
after the lapse of four years !
by the way , added gringoire , looking at the archdeacon in a half bantering way , are you still thinking of her ?
then she went to seek in the corner of her cell a huge paving stone , which served her as a pillow , and launched it against them with such violence that one of the bars broke , emitting thousands of sparks
some one has passed through the sewer
and can you get a lever ?
get off that bed , you lazy thing !
we are equally far removed from the hosanna of joseph de maistre , who wound up by anointing the executioner , and from the sneer of voltaire , who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross
it was an impression which vanished speedily , but which was irresistible at the moment
at times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing , so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths
it was gribier 's voice
a long shiver traversed her frame from head to foot ; her teeth chattered ; she half raised her head and said , pressing her elbows against her hips , and clasping her feet in her hands as though to warm them , --
a fire was burning there ; which indicated that jean valjean 's reply : i will remain below , had been foreseen
the priest fancied that he perceived the form of quasimodo
by bending over , one could have readily recognized a coin , -- no doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little savoyard
what was quite unprecedented , she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her
surprised , intoxicated , charmed , i allowed myself to gaze upon thee
if the old woman could have seen him at that moment , she would have been frightened
all this work was performed without any hindrance , in less than an hour , and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance
no one has ever found out
i have not seen you for a long time
let us come to an explanation about the emperor
i see stars and lances of fire
the nile rat kills the crocodile , the swordfish kills the whale , the book will kill the edifice
the sewer has , nowadays , assumed a certain official aspect
meanwhile , mahiette was gazing with ever-increasing anxiety at that wan , withered , dishevelled head , and her eyes filled with tears
god produces his miracles as seems good to him
when javert laughed , -- and his laugh was rare and terrible , -- his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth , but his gums , and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold , as on the muzzle of a wild beast
hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting , when the child , with surprise , beheld the goat ( one of whose miraclesthis was no doubt ) , draw out certain letters with its golden hoof , and arrange them , with gentle pushes , in a certain order
they sealed each tradition beneath a monument
this last happiness now constituted his whole future ; after that , gloom
opposite this tree , which was an ash , there was a chestnut-tree , suffering from a peeling of the bark , to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing
he knew , from the diminution in the jolting , when they left the pavements and reached the earth road
i will conduct you to see the lions of the hôtel du roi , which are wild beasts
the saint-antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders ; the barricade of the temple was silence
the heap of stones , destined for no one knows what employment , which was visible there thirty years ago , is doubtless still there
a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the court-house , in verses that limped a little : -maitre corbeau , sur un dossier perche , [ number ] tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire ; maitre renard , par l'odeur alleche , lui fit a peu pres cette histoire : he !
a heap of dead bodies in the upper part , a river of blood in the lower part -- such was that road on the evening of the numberth of june , number
the young girl allowed phoebus to have his way
in the second place -- is the cabriolet for monsieur le maire ?
i have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the rue plumet
when she became silent tristan l ’ hermite frowned , but it was to conceal a tear which welled up in his tiger ’ s eye
there were griffins which had the air of laughing , gargoyles which one fancied one heard yelping , salamanders which puffed at the fire , tarasques which sneezed in the smoke
the recluse had gone and seated herself by her daughter , covering her with her body , in front of her , with staring eyes , listening to the poor child , who did not stir , but who kept murmuring in a low voice , these words only , phoebus !
down with the mystery !
master simon sanguin , the elector of picardy , with his wife on the crupper !
in this unknown , every step that he risked might be his last
wathier 's column alone had suffered in the disaster ; delort 's column , which ney had deflected to the left , as though he had a presentiment of an ambush , had arrived whole
such was this curious house
every day , she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience , she found marius there , she felt herself unspeakably happy , and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean : -what a delicious garden that luxembourg is !
i have enjoyed still other successes
as they approached the earth , these two jets of liquid lead spread out in sheaves , like water springing from the thousand holes of a watering-pot
on the first day he ate the meat , on the second he ate the fat , on the third he gnawed the bone
the revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke
he walked with no less indecision than cosette
his legs alone were motionless
she took note of the hour
when the wind cuts your face , when it freezes , it is all the same ; you must still wash
sister perpetue was a robust nun from marines near pontoise , who chattered her patois , droned , grumbled , sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid , treated her patients abruptly , roughly , was crabbed with the dying , almost flung god in their faces , stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage ; was bold , honest , and ruddy
such a thing can not be refused
besides , what was the use of seeing each other ?
by the giants of 'number
fear stunned the young girl
it was a perfect delirium
the flag on the dome of the tuileries was white
i should really like to know what your secret is , thought fleur-de-lys
yes , truly , replied the young man , and fell back into his glacial and absent-minded silence
jean valjean had not uttered a single word
and it was you who found it !
it seemed to her as though she beheld advancing from all quarters towards her , with the intention of crawling up her body and biting and pinching her , all those hideous implements of torture , which as compared to the instruments of all sorts she had hitherto seen , were like what bats , centipedes , and spiders are among insects and birds
when the prisoner 's right arm was free , thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him
this is a child whom i have reared
that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul
he added , after a silence , and what shall i do with the sorceress ?
the rue rambuteau has devastated all that
why is it so solid ?
all this was so rapidly executed , that it was all over when those about the wine-shop noticed it
no , you are mistaken !
she beheld a large troop of armed men , both horse and foot , drawn up on the grève
this makes heaps in my room
a cobbler opposite called them to him , and delivered to them a paper which their mother had left for them
all , with the exception of laigle , were from the south
on the numberth of april , number , a passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the rue sainte-marguerite and shouted : i am a babouvist !
he had thick eyelashes , enormous black whiskers , prominent eyes , the lower part of his face like a snout ; and besides all this , that air of being on his own ground , which is indescribable
jean valjean had , in fact , returned home , and had said to cosette : we set out this evening and we go to the rue de l'homme arme with toussaint
the barricade was ten times attacked , approached , assailed , scaled , and never captured
i took that from the monkeys
kekcaa signifies : quest que c'est que cela a ?
a guttural laugh replied from the interior of the wall to these bloody words -- hah !
moreover , and we must not forget this , interests which are not very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way
the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation
m gillenormand 's mobile face was no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature
it appears , said gringoire , that this one can also talk ; but tis a rude language , and he is more fortunate than i if he understands itthen , smiting his brow , in a sudden transition of ideas : by the way , what the deuce did they mean this morning with their esmeralda ?
she repeated her question
then he went away
combeferre , surrounded by students and artisans , was speaking of the dead , of jean prouvaire , of bahorel , of mabeuf , and even of cabuc , and of enjolras ' sad severity
he heard the sound of a bolt
was this another hallucination ?
let this serve you as a lesson , you dealer in second-hand secrets , merchant of mysteries , rummager of the shadows , wretch !
the prisoner resumed : -do what you please with me
in the rue sainte-croix-de-la-bretonnerie , twenty young men , bearded and with long hair , entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later , carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape , and having at their head three men armed , one with a sword , one with a gun , and the third with a pike
javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad
he had a vague feeling that he should play a ridiculous figure in it
all who served b-u-o-naparte were brigands !
a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away
it is mingled with the air
enjolras , who had just re-loaded his , handed it to him
after which , i nail her up
pay for the poor people and give them five francs , and do not tell them that it was i
the two problems must be combined and made but one
expensive drugs are required
and m mabeuf fell into a delicious revery
can the soul be completely made over by fate , and become evil , fate being evil ?
when he beheld him in broad daylight , striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death , he recognized him
jean valjean 's inclination led him , as we have seen , to the least frequented spots , to solitary nooks , to forgotten places
this incident , this last proof , produced a great effect
is not a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays ?
the elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants ' hall , and which the nuns called the buttery
the beggar turned round ; there was surprise , recognition , a lighting up of the two countenances , and so forth ; then , without paying the slightest heed in the world to the spectators , the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a low tone , holding each other ’ s hands , in the meantime , while the rags of clopin trouillefou , spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais , produced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange
the cake was wet ; but they were hungry and thirsty
as he was handing it to him , he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp
then he heard his soul , which had become terrible once more , give vent to a dull roar in the gloom
cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father
nothing , replied liénarde , in great confusion ; it is my neighbor , gisquette la gencienne , who wishes to speak with you
it is for a woman , but it 's for the people
in the winter she did not undress , in order that she might not be so cold
on another occasion , continued the poet , with a smile , i peeped through the keyhole , before going to bed , and i beheld the most delicious dame in her shift that ever made a bed creak under her bare foot
when i caught sight of your little ones , so pretty , so clean , and so happy , it overwhelmed me
to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice
we were not made -- here she paused , fixed her dull eyes on marius , and burst out laughing , saying , with an intonation which contained every form of anguish , stifled by every form of cynicism : -bah !
this was almost indignantly refused
monseigneur , said a soldier , he has disappeared
she laid down the book , caught up a pen , and exclaimed : -and i know how to write , too !
a hundred years ago , the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence , the pickpocket in danger slipped thither ; the forest had its cave , paris had its sewer
with the exception of the patrol , no one had passed through the street since he had been there
his bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable
and then , cosette , in whom the woman was beginning to dawn , was delighted to be a baroness
the man 's head was bent down , and he did not see him approaching
the bourgeoisie then , as well as the statesmen , required a man who should express this word halt
these clamors attracted the attention of the cardinal
nothing was to be heard but this
in the meantime , all the beggars , all the lackeys , all the cutpurses , joined with the scholars , had gone in procession to seek , in the cupboard of the law clerks ’ company , the cardboard tiara , and the derisive robe of the pope of the fools
do you know what that torture is , which is imposed upon you for long nights by your burning arteries , your bursting heart , your breaking head , your teeth-knawed hands ; mad tormentors which turn you incessantly , as upon a red-hot gridiron , to a thought of love , of jealousy , and of despair !
she uttered a cry of joy
impressed solely with the child 's gown and the old man 's hair , he had dubbed the daughter mademoiselle lanoire , and the father , monsieur leblanc , so that as no one knew them under any other title , this nickname became a law in the default of any other name
cosette always moved as little as possible
on the stroke of nine , do you understand , i shall be in the garden
what lay below was not water , it was a gulf
that set me to thinking
to the abbey of ascend-with-regret , [ number ] replied gavroche
some of these faubourgs were important : there were , first , starting from la tournelle , the bourg saint-victor , with its one arch bridge over the bièvre , its abbey where one could read the epitaph of louis le gros , _epitaphium ludovici grossi_ , and its church with an octagonal spire , flanked with four little bell towers of the eleventh century ( a similar one can be seen at etampes ; it is not yet destroyed ) ; next , the bourg saint-marceau , which already had three churches and one convent ; then , leaving the mill of the gobelins and its four white walls on the left , there was the faubourg saint-jacques with the beautiful carved cross in its square ; the church of saint-jacques du haut-pas , which was then gothic , pointed , charming ; saint-magloire , a fine nave of the fourteenth century , which napoleon turned into a hayloft ; notre-dame des champs , where there were byzantine mosaics ; lastly , after having left behind , full in the country , the monastery des chartreux , a rich edifice contemporary with the palais de justice , with its little garden divided into compartments , and the haunted ruins of vauvert , the eye fell , to the west , upon the three roman spires of saint-germain des prés
the uproar still filled the city
toussaint was busy in her kitchen , which opened on the back yard
my father , charles the seventh , was accustomed to say that the truth was ailing ; i thought her dead , and that she had found no confessor
he took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit , considering it something to hold his own against europe , but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner
the one who is singing ?
she added , as though with an effort : -the address -- you know very well !
he was harsh for a time towards the former , because , holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes , the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape
it was the poor goat , the agile djali , which had made its escape after her , at the moment when quasimodo had put to flight charmolue ’ s brigade , and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly an hour past , without being able to win a glance
you will not crumble so easily , will you , my good bastille ?
hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace , when all of a sudden , and without transition , he made a strange movement , which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror , had they witnessed it
let them talk , little one !
now , if there are any fathers among you , fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their child 's tiny hand in their robust hand , let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own
the death of the poor scholar imparted a furious ardor to that crowd
this , as the reader knows , happened from time to time , at very long intervals
it is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all , that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries , and that from the moment he presented himself , there existed among them a secret , suppressed rivalry , which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves , but which broke forth , none the less , every instant , in their gestures and remarks
but he did not abuse his knowledge
he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs , and his handkerchief
then he continued : from the tuileries to the luxembourg , there is but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage ; that is not far
a full month elapsed , during which marius went every day to the luxembourg
i became vagrant and wandering like yourself
in this state of revery , an eye which could have cast a glance into marius ' interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul
however , he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of father six-fours , the water-carrier , and would have thought no more about it
its wall included a large part of that plain where julian had built his hot baths
said the soldier , ah !
now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers , a fantastic dwarf climbing , writhing , crawling on all fours , descending outside above the abyss , leaping from projection to projection , and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon ; it was quasimodo dislodging the crows
as long as i had money , i feasted , i lead a mad and joyous life
tis a thing deserving of compassion , i assure you
he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of , and he walked on tiptoe
we are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons , and the sublimity of prayer
the frail glass door gave passage to two persons , and closed noiselessly behind them ; it was a man and a woman
the river is the true grave
i am not related to cosette
and finally , i am at your orders , i and my wits , and my science and my letters , ready to live with you , damsel , as it shall please you , chastely or joyously ; husband and wife , if you see fit ; brother and sister , if you think that better
i do not see the accused
the thickets of the king ’ s gardens , which covered the western point of the city , masked the island du passeur
en capote bleue , la poule au shako , voici la banlieue !
take away time is money , what remains of england ?
he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one 's self , all of a sudden , face to face , in the dark , with a tiger
on the face of this aged queen of our cathedrals , by the side of a wrinkle , one always finds a scar
in the meantime , boulatruelle 's manoeuvres in the forest ceased ; and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending ; and people gossiped of something else
in proportion as the situation grew gloomy , the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade more and more
gentlemen , my father always detested me because i could not understand mathematics
the angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew
then , by way of dinner , he tried to sleep
good heavens , how pretty that little goat was !
he must watch it , cheek it , repress it , and obey it only at the last extremity
get it well fixed in your noddles , my children , that you are in the true road
thanks to the sand , there was not a speck of mud ; thanks to the rain , there was not a grain of ashes
while he was discussing this modest dinner , he had , twice or thrice , noticed in a confused way , toussaint 's stammering words as she said to him : monsieur , there is something going on , they are fighting in paris
better , is it not ?
et je n ’ ai moi , par la sang-dieu ! ni foi , ni loi , ni feu , ni lieu , ni roi , ni dieu
i am willing that they should cut my throat , and i am ready to swear that i never said either you , thou , or i , in my life , if i do not know that parisian
my knees have been worn for fifteen years in praying to thee , my god !
its entrance was guarded by a force of halberdiers with the armorial bearings of the bishop
that done , he had a fainting fit
the poor mother bowed her head
would you wish the king to fall ill again ?
he resumed his dainty , caressing air
to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism
then she felt a pang at her heart
there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation ; he was eloquent with that eloquence
it certainly was singular that the stoker of order , that the engineer of authority , mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road , could be unseated by a flash of light !
whence had issued that fulminating convict , who almost without taking breath , and with the same set of combatants in hand , pulverized , one after the other , the five armies of the emperor of germany , upsetting beaulieu on alvinzi , wurmser on beaulieu , melas on wurmser , mack on melas ?
hill , having been weakened , had come up to the support of wellington ; picton was dead
not a drop of water !
he was entirely nude , of the hue of ashes , and mounted on a horse which was earth color
_corne-de-boeuf_ , what a jest !
is it possible that irony is derived from it ?
any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in number a congregation of bernardines-benedictines , with salamanca for the head of the order , and alcala as the branch establishment
thenardier was cunning , greedy , slothful , and clever
probity , sincerity , candor , conviction , the sense of duty , are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed ; but which , even when hideous , remain grand : their majesty , the majesty peculiar to the human conscience , clings to them in the midst of horror ; they are virtues which have one vice , -- error
[ number ] -- there 's a festive programme , there 's a good one , or else i know nothing of such matters , deuce take it !
do not be vexed , marius , give me permission to speak ; i say no evil of the people as you see , i am always harping on your people , but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie
i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge , as it is my duty to do
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket , drew out a sort of a pass-key , opened the door , entered , closed it again carefully , and ascended the staircase , still carrying cosette
one thing is certain , that la esmeralda had come to france while still very young , by way of hungary
moreover , m mabeuf had continued his downward course
he recalled his former companions : how wretched they were ; they rose at dawn , and toiled until night ; hardly were they permitted to sleep ; they lay on camp beds , where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick , in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year ; they were clothed in frightful red blouses ; they were allowed , as a great favor , linen trousers in the hottest weather , and a woollen carter 's blouse on their backs when it was very cold ; they drank no wine , and ate no meat , except when they went on fatigue duty
a biscuit , in the shady symbolism of prisons , signifies : nothing to be done
finally , no longer knowing what to do , and what was to become of me , i denounced you to the official
he was on the point of swooning ; he saw marius through a dazzling light
this chapel , quite new , having been built only six years , was entirely in that charming taste of delicate architecture , of marvellous sculpture , of fine and deep chasing , which marks with us the end of the gothic era , and which is perpetuated to about the middle of the sixteenth century in the fairylike fancies of the renaissance
toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other
some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there ; m thibord du chalard , m lemarchant de gomicourt , and the celebrated scoffer of the right , m cornet-dincourt
this is what marius read in it : -madame la comtesse : it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old
marius heard his heart beating in his temples , he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears , his bleeding father , vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him , and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him
it had rained on the preceding night ; the soil was soaked
thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase : the fortunate and the unfortunate
in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation , there was acceptance of peril
the ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows , but the vessel has its soul , its compass , which counsels it and always shows it the north
marius lived in a state of delight
you must inspire confidence !
are you not intending to take her away from us ?
he said of the crucifix : there is a gibbet which has been a success
they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat
we do not know that which it is necessary to know , and we know that which we should ignore
it was at the moment when he was returning , on quasimodo day , from saying his mass at the altar of the lazy , which was by the side of the door leading to the nave on the right , near the image of the virgin , that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for foundlings
it is true , nevertheless , that grave-diggers do die themselves
i am your friend
you want me to swear ?
i am called lesgueules , by contraction lesgle , and by corruption l'aigle
in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked
there was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys , and whose name was sister agatha
she had a confused consciousness of something horrible
he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood !
one of them said to us one day , the sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot
what have they given us in return for all this gallic history , for all this gothic art ?
the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime ; they called jean valjean the other fauvent
it has already been put into verse
will you deny , said coictier , the sympathetic force of the collar bone , and the cabalistics which are derived from it ?
the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable , tortuous , colossal citadel
for a space of fifteen years , those great principles which are so old for the thinker , so new for the statesman , could be seen at work in perfect peace , on the public square ; equality before the law , liberty of conscience , liberty of speech , liberty of the press , the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions
they were heard to say : thanks for royalism !
the big big girls -- those over ten years of age -- called her agathocles
to no there is only one reply , yes
jean valjean had labored over cosette
did you notice how i played that game on him , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of february ?
the beautiful candle is extinguished and i have henceforth , only a wretched tallow dip which smokes in my nose
the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat , a gesture characteristic of the vulture , and replied with an augmented smile
and you kept a pot-house at montfermeil
they touched each other , they gazed at each other , they clasped each other 's hands , they pressed close to each other ; but there was a distance which they did not pass
he got as far as the rue pavee , shook his head and turned back ; then he went no further than the rue des trois-pavillons ; then he did not overstep the blancs-manteaux
that is suspicious , said the provost
all night long i have seen white things , and persons who smiled at me

one might almost say that he had assumed its form , as the snail takes on the form of its shell
the gardener , spade on back , replied in the most unconcerned tone : -it is the riots
still the white-haired man and the girl advanced
to you , louis de beaumont , bishop of paris , counsellor in the court of parliament , i , clopin trouillefou , king of thunes , grand coësre , prince of argot , bishop of fools , i say : our sister , falsely condemned for magic , hath taken refuge in your church , you owe her asylum and safety
the abyss was there below him
cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her ; she turned round
in her early childhood she must even have been pretty
thus he proceeded in the gloom

who was this jean valjean ?
brushing one 's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one 's soul

he was full of resources
happily , if he saw the lantern well , the lantern saw him but ill
the thicket , bristling as it was , struck him as the best road
javert followed jean valjean

admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed of a wrath and of an enigma , one divined in the first barricade the dragon , and behind the second the sphinx
in the second year of his work , bruneseau engaged the assistance of his son-in-law nargaud
manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself , buried but still alive
perhaps he was above compensation , but no one is above gratitude
all at once , cosette paused ; she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers ' doll , which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table
men , women , children , hurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses , and hung there like cats , with teeth , finger nails and toe nails

they were waiting with a quiver for the great blow which should split it open
at that epoch , the northern extremity of the rue saint-louis was in process of repaving
he had probably been through the campaign of number , and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor , it would seem
all at once , without himself knowing what was in him , and what impulse he was obeying , he sprang to his feet , stretched both arms out of the window , gazed intently into the gloom , the silence , the infinite darkness , the eternal immensity , and exclaimed : long live the emperor !

the work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome
what do you want with me ?

such wastes of riches do occur
the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna ; the tolbiac of clovis and the austerlitz of napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water

he told himself that it was plain , that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever , and that cosette had written that to some one
the second article , which enters a little more into detail , is an extract from the journal de paris , of the same date
moreover , he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris ; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the cafe lemblin , and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire , that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the ermitage , on the boulevard du maine , spatchcocked chickens at mother sauget 's , excellent matelotes at the barriere de la cunette , and a certain thin white wine at the barriere du com pat

to be prince equality , to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution , to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power , therein lay the fortune of louis philippe in number ; never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event ; the one entered into the other , and the incarnation took place
great perils have this fine characteristic , that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers
again he paused ; marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder
if you were to see me die , you would laugh
he recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin , as though he wished the man to understand , without advising him directly and harshly , that this would afford him a refuge
the sorbonne was the bucolic spot where i adored thee from eve till morn
the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen , the police agent against the mayor , the man who is down against the man who is up in the world , is what i call false kindness

but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m madeleine
after the departure of the ruffians , the rue plumet resumed its tranquil , nocturnal aspect
and he continued to advance
nevertheless , there were people of the cabaret les vantes , who said that they had seen her pass along the road to paris , walking on the pebbles with her bare feet
he continued : -i said to myself , the moon is bright : it is going to freeze
this gentleman of property was very shy , -- never coming out except in the evening , speaking to no one , except , occasionally to the poor , and never allowing any one to approach him
roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women , that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible

consider that i knew the sergeants very well
the husband was both master and mistress

the passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it , without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths
he replied : i wanted to know
his memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly , losing their proper forms , becoming disproportionately large , then suddenly disappearing , as in a muddy and perturbed pool

in any case , and in spite of whatever may be said , the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
about an hour later , jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard , and with his arms
andry the red laughed in an idiotic way : notre-dame is making work for the hospital , said he

the restoration had placed him on half-pay , then had sent him into residence , that is to say , under surveillance , at vernon
this oddity had attracted customers to his shop , and brought him young men , who said to each other : come hear father hucheloup growl
it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows
he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people , over what we now call the idea of the nationality , had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case
two strongholds of slavery ; but in the first , deliverance possible , a legal limit always in sight , and then , escape

he no longer boxed the maids ' ears ; he no longer thumped the landing-place so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in opening the door
madame my mother , said fleur-de-lys gently , that gate is now called the porte d ’ enfer
the lantern of the labyrinth of the jardin des plantes is also very ingenious
as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table , there came a knock at the door
marius had not even seen him
we have not always been as we are now
he fell to thinking
he did not love his grandfather much , as the latter 's gayety and cynicism repelled him , and his feelings towards his father were gloomy

upon my word , said he , in his tone of intrepid fatuity , here is a charming creature !

the archdeacon , on perceiving these wan spots all around the choir , thought he beheld the mitres of damned bishops
in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty , when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal , bewildered , furious , exasperated at having to yield , disputing the ground , hoping for a possible flight , seeking an escape , what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear !
go to the devil !
she belongs not to the king !
two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers
at length gervaise , the most curious of the three , and consequently the least sensitive , tried to make the recluse speak :
exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag , he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps , who were holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived , and who were allowing the insurrection to fry in its own fat , to use the celebrated expression of one of them
the first street on the left
fleur-de-lys ran up and trembled
she pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor ; he entered
she is well , works as you would wish , and loves me
what , then , is progress ?

it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple
we will go to see the savages
she lay down again , with the nun 's assistance , helped the nun to arrange her pillow , and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck , and which sister simplice had given her
two of these women were dressed like good _bourgeoises_ of paris
the obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation of level

however things might stand , -- and it was to this point that he reverted constantly , -- one fact dominated everything else for him , and that was , that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law
all of a sudden , he could see nothing
at night he swam off again , and reached the shore a little way from cape brun
i shall watch over your departure , you ruffian , and at that moment i will count out to you twenty thousand francs
he had been waiting for fantine to awake
teeth and claws fear what they can not grasp
when gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballets , babet took thenardier aside
if any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery , there was but one way for him to get out -- his grave-digger 's card furnished by the department of public funerals
the incomprehensible had just made its entrance into fauchelevent 's hut
she moved the chairs about , she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode , she handled marius ' clothes , she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners
she is hungry , said gringoire , charmed to enter into conversation
pray walk a little , that i may see you at full height , and that i may hear your spurs jingle
well , you can do to-day for me that which i did for you in the olden days
at the same time , the usher handed him the paper
guillaume rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene , --
gavroche must have delivered my letter to him
now , these parents groan , these old folks implore us , these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons ; they desire our return , and offer to kill calves for usbeing virtuous , we obey them
the hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity

he gazed with terror on this beauty , which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him , beneath his very eyes , on the innocent and formidable brow of that child , from the depths of her homeliness , of his old age , of his misery , of his reprobation
only he grew colder and colder ; laconic at meals , and rare in the house
a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips , as though on a piano where some notes are missing
it was the terror and dazzled amazement of the men of the sanctuary , in the presence of the luminous press of gutenberg

mother thenardier released her daughters , made them descend from the swing , and said : -now amuse yourselves , all three of you
yes , an ineffable something which wounded fleur-de-lys
replied the lad , as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him
the density , which was his support , was also an obstacle

the fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse , torn trousers of coarse velvet , bare feet , and something which resembled a pool of blood

if it is eight o'clock , at eight o'clock and at all hours !
it was the house which nicolas flamel had built , where he had died about number , and which , constantly deserted since that time , had already begun to fall in ruins , -- so greatly had the hermetics and the alchemists of all countries wasted away the walls , merely by carving their names upon them
do not say that even in jest ! if you were to cease to love me , i would spring after you , i would scratch you , i should rend you , i would throw you into the water , i would have you arrested
some days later , one morning , when the sun was shining brightly , and they were both on the steps leading to the garden , another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself , and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt , cosette , in a wrapper , was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star ; and , with her head bathed in light , rosy after a good sleep , submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man , she was picking a daisy to pieces
i have travelled twelve leagues
i don ’ t even know your name
comrade , this is your last resource
look at him , the pig ! -- come !

courfeyrac and bossuet , whose brave good humor increased with the peril , like madame scarron , replaced nourishment with pleasantry , and , as wine was lacking , they poured out gayety to all
it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man ; he had his big arm-chair carried to marius ' bedside ; he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages
nevertheless , it remains a riot
finally , the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd , who served the member of the convention in his hovel , had come in quest of a doctor ; that the old wretch was dying , that paralysis was gaining on him , and that he would not live over night -- thank god !
come , said he , you must have a little pity
now , in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table , we can not do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle baptistine 's letters to madame boischevron , wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minuteness
he walked in an enigma

twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july , the year number had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening
the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle , which was wide open ; the breezes of february are not warm ; as the fishwife , clad in a low-necked gown , replied to the spaniard , she shivered , laughed and coughed

of all pitched battles , waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants
this respite , which was thus prolonged , was a sign that the government was taking its time , and collecting its forces
a useful and graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls

the spire of saint-sulpice , and the three lofty needles of saint germain-des-prés , rose above the horizon on his right
he wasted a tolerably large allowance , something like three thousand francs a year , in doing nothing
children disappeared in paris ; the police carried them off , for what mysterious purpose no one knew
jean valjean , bewildered , let her have her own way
he was the marble lover of liberty
three pieces of a hundred sous , said fauchelevent
let us not apply a flame where only a light is required
this man was at the barricade , said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself
then she added with a pitiless expression , well aware that she was about to pierce the priest ’ s heart with thousands of red-hot irons , --
i have said that i would put earth in it
he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk , which was very near , then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl
cosette had slept only a few hours , but soundly
chapter v the two men clothed in black
my piece of money !
he made some remarks about a door which shut badly , and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman ; then he entered fantine 's chamber , approached the bed and drew aside the curtains
who is there who is not fifty years old ?
extreme as was the crisis , inevitable as was the catastrophe , there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man , who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water
he took advantage of their fright , and while they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had fallen from heaven , and while they were putting out the eyes of the stone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and buckshot , quasimodo was silently piling up plaster , stones , and rough blocks of stone , even the sacks of tools belonging to the masons , on the edge of the balustrade from which the beam had already been hurled
he extended his hands
at that word which jean valjean had just uttered once more , all that was swelling marius ' heart found vent
it resembled the faint , vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures
outside the pale of that holy thing , justice , by what right does one form of man despise another ?
do you know , my dear , that parliament hath full jurisdiction over all places of asylum , and that you were running a great risk in your little chamber at notre-dame ?
no one was ever able to discover how , and by what connivance , he succeeded in procuring , and secreting a bottle of wine , invented , so it is said , by desrues , with which a narcotic is mixed , and which the band of the endormeurs , or sleep-compellers , rendered famous
marius , said m gillenormand , you will set out for vernon to-morrow
just let me see you , you good-for-nothing !
she was dressed in white and had a white veil on her head
chopin quitted the dram-shop
after the lapse of a few minutes , he was no longer blind
it was there that bauduin was killed
_cornutus et hirsutus_ , horned and hairy , another went on
in the same way that one says of corneille : where did he find the means of dying ?
all armed protests , even the most legitimate , even that of the numberth of august , even that of july numberth , begin with the same troubles
history neglects nearly all these particulars , and can not do otherwise ; the infinity would overwhelm itnevertheless , these details , which are wrongly called trivial , -- there are no trivial facts in humanity , nor little leaves in vegetation , -- are useful
he did not even start , but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark : it is perfectly simple
as the reader perceives , the pillory of the grève was far from presenting all the recreations of the pillory of the halles
the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this
give me twenty francs
that was the number which i counted , said the bishop
on the crest of the highest gallery , higher than the central rose window , there was a great flame rising between the two towers with whirlwinds of sparks , a vast , disordered , and furious flame , a tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind , from time to time
their nerves have turned to bone ; their bones have turned to stone
that is different ; but go to the inn all the same , and get an extra horse ; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads
before the right gets set free , there is foam and tumult
he is better dressed , that is all !
until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded , war , that at least which is the effort of the future , which is hastening on against the past , which is lagging in the rear , may be necessary
the earth was thus better lighted than the sky , which produces a particularly sinister effect , and the hill , whose contour was poor and mean , was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
he had done nothing if he did not do all this ; his whole life was useless ; all his penitence was wasted
the man was montparnasse
this man , we will state at once , was a former member of the convention
the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance

ever since you were wounded , she has passed her time in weeping and making lint
dampness was invading it , the flowers were deserting it
the good man entered
it now seemed probable that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person
the orgy grew more and more flemish
all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices
we do not need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the tour de l'horologe , to find out the number of degrees of cold ; we feel our blood congealing in our veins , and the ice forming round our hearts , and we say : there is no god !

and then , when all was said , although the president was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man , he was , at the same time , a devoted and almost an ardent royalist , and he had been shocked to hear the mayor of m sur m say the emperor , and not bonaparte , when alluding to the landing at cannes
we still cherish a hope that they will not dare
he almost trembled lest she should want him
at least , that is the way in which monsieur the cure of saint-remy explains why these women are colder and hungrier than other poor women , when they are old

jehan did not allow him to finish
you can not go to see them without sinking into the earth
as we have seen , prayer , the celebration of the offices of religion , alms-giving , the consolation of the afflicted , the cultivation of a bit of land , fraternity , frugality , hospitality , renunciation , confidence , study , work , filled every day of his life
that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree !
how do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand ?
ou vont les belles filles , lon la
from scruples , the mother proceeded to uneasiness : but what if the police were to annoy us ?
jean valjean 's purse was of no use to m mabeuf
these sudden congealments in the state of revery , which a single word suffices to evoke , do occur
the doctor dismissed her
the sewers of rome , says liebig , have absorbed all the well-being of the roman peasant
the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators
there was in tholomyes a district attorney , and in courfeyrac a paladin
all we shall then have to do , will be to thrash you soundly for the space of a week
for them , the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness
would you like to have her pay you in the face ?
then the poor man fell to sobbing
he had kept all the pain to himself
marius stepped up to the doctor
ask of me anything you wish !
no one was present excepting the nun and the mayor
his coat was of the best cut , but threadbare
the latter , of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorbeau house , was a very cunning and very adroit young spark , with a bewildered and plaintive air
lacenaire made this response , enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned , but clear to the police : perhaps it was patron-minette
marius was seized with a shudder
in vain did he struggle , he was reduced to confess , in his inmost heart , the sublimity of that wretch
his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him i-deny-god ( je-nie dieu , chenildieu )
monsieur , said jean valjean , i should like to say a word to you in private
curled , pomaded , with laced waist , the hips of a woman , the bust of a prussian officer , the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him , his cravat knowingly tied , a bludgeon in his pocket , a flower in his buttonhole ; such was this dandy of the sepulchre
a cloud swept across marius ' brow
and they will look at your hands
the adventure smacked of enchantment
in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman , and in that garden , a passable apple-tree
no more than yourself !
after some hesitation , he decided to apply to this man , not without having first glanced behind and in front of him , as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put
it was three days since she had seen marius
while , if he accomplished his sacrifice , a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys , the post , the iron necklet , the green cap , unceasing toil , and pitiless shame
there was no piece of furniture adapted to sleeping purposes , except a tolerably long wooden coffer ; and its cover was carved , to boot ; which afforded gringoire , when he stretched himself out upon it , a sensation somewhat similar to that which micromégas would feel if he were to lie down on the alps
that is very lucky , said the old man , in a reproachful tone
the archdeacon had just seated himself , by the light of a three-jetted copper lamp , before a vast coffer crammed with manuscripts
i will lie in wait for him better another time , he said , dropping his head
i had had an idea for a long time ; a resemblance ; inquiries which you had caused to be made at faverolles ; the strength of your loins ; the adventure with old fauchelevant ; your skill in marksmanship ; your leg , which you drag a little ; -- i hardly know what all , -- absurdities !
nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle , senile palsy , offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught
the two young girls dropped their eyes
the shades , those sombre hatchers of primitive christianity , only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light
i ’ m afraid lest the bohemian should see me
jondrette thenardier , vile rascal !
but this confusion vanished ; a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly ; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage
loud laughter everywhere , and obscene songs
can they have gone out ?
he told himself that he must do his duty ; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it ; that if he allowed things to take their own course , if he remained at m sur m , his consideration , his good name , his good works , the deference and veneration paid to him , his charity , his wealth , his popularity , his virtue , would be seasoned with a crime
so marius possessed cosette , as spirits possess , but he enveloped her with all his soul , and seized her jealously with incredible conviction
in the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the english camp were audible
at that moment he was sublime
a problem presented itself
they had stolen , violated , pillaged , murdered , assassinated
i know what it is
but be in love gayly then , what the deuce !
they were no longer than my thumb , and one had to see the child ’ s little feet come out of them , in order to believe that they had been able to get into them
such was the condition of the country when fantine returned thither
they have gone for the nearest , to flachot 's place , where there is a farrier ; but it makes no difference ; it will take a good quarter of an hour
and , if it was a christmas eve , while the great bell , which seemed to emit the death rattle , summoned the faithful to the midnight mass , such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng , and that the rose window was watching it
the stars are like the lamps in illuminations , one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out , i am bewildered , as though horses were breathing in my ears ; although it is night , i hear hand-organs and spinning-machines , and i do not know what all
every army has a rear-guard , and it is that which must be blamed
he uplifts his hands , utters furious groans , clenches his nails on the beach , tries to cling fast to that ashes , supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath , and sobs frantically ; the sand mounts higher
in nailing up the coffin ?
but little by little that patience which had borne up under the lash of the torturer , yielded and gave way before all these stings of insects
but what proof was there that that thief had been champmathieu ?
mother hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account
an oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by god , but that adam looked upon her when she was unfolding , and shewas ashamed and turned crimson
what a reason for lasting !
the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned gavroche of the presence of the policeman , contained no other talisman than the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms
the person who had climbed up to that carving must have risked his life
nothing now remained to him of his life 's work
even when he had thought himself lost , he had not drawn back
the passer-by can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet
he surveyed him from head to foot , while that personage made exaggerated bows , and demanded in a curt tone : what do you want ?
at this name , the shadow ’ s grasp shook the arm of phoebus in a fury
when we got home , we could not find it anywhere
they talked to him about it for one day ; it was a moment , a flash , as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved ; then all closed again
hah ! -- the gypsy watched the priest retire in the direction of the pont notre-dame
i swear to you , that it is indispensable that we should be alone
i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in bad part ; mohammed had his good points ; respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques !
there he beheld more than ever the star , and less than ever savigny and gans
these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them
she was in unison with father gillenormand ; while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims , she exhaled goodness like a perfume
it is a language
his intonation admitted of no deliberation
it was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people , who called to him from her threshold , in an angry way : a good mayor is a useful thing
you can not be even a curate
he began to distinguish something
corinthe created an obstacle , the rue mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left , no attack was possible except from the rue saint-denis , that is to say , in front , and in full sight
thanks to this precaution , which he always was careful to take at the moment when on the point of beginning an examination , he knew beforehand the names , titles , and misdeeds of the accused , made cut and dried responses to questions foreseen , and succeeded in extricating himself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his deafness to be too apparent
that congregation of bourgeois habitations , pressed together like the cells in a hive , had a beauty of its own
truly , these roastings are a stupendous thing !
shouted the furious pedestrian
you must know my name
in the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities , rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia , employing everything , not losing a single dream , not a single slumber , sowing an animalcule here , crumbling to bits a planet there , oscillating and winding , making of light a force and of thought an element , disseminated and invisible , dissolving all , except that geometrical point , the i ; bringing everything back to the soul-atom ; expanding everything in god , entangling all activity , from summit to base , in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism , attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth , subordinating , who knows ?
quasimodo , whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to him , continued to stare intently at the judge , and made no reply
the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him
mon ami pierrot , tu babilles , parce que l'autre jour mila cogna sa vitre et m'appela , ou vont les belles filles , lon la
mother sainte-mechtilde , intrusted with the singing and the choir , was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter
he followed it , then lost it
coictier tried to grin , shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly , and repeated in a low voice , --
he pondered ; he examined the slopes , noted the declivities , scrutinized the clumps of trees , the square of rye , the path ; he seemed to be counting each bush
the base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles
at reichenau , he gave lessons in mathematics , while his sister adelaide did wool work and sewed
i want to keep my child !
and she felt herself lifted from the ground
you shall never leave us again
a few moments after the formation of the battle-array , in the midst of that profound silence , like that which heralds the beginning of a storm , which precedes engagements , the emperor tapped haxo on the shoulder , as he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders , detached by his orders from the corps of erlon , reille , and lobau , and destined to begin the action by taking mont-saint-jean , which was situated at the intersection of the nivelles and the genappe roads , and said to him , there are four and twenty handsome maids , general
about two o'clock in the morning , they reckoned up their strength
small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented , one the abbe of chaliot , bishop of saint claude ; the other , the abbe tourteau , vicar-general of agde , abbe of grand-champ , order of citeaux , diocese of chartres
decazes and deserre were members : -- pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base , [ number ] il faut changer de sol , et de serre et de case
at length he released jean valjean , straightened himself stiffly up without bending , grasped his bludgeon again firmly , and , as though in a dream , he murmured rather than uttered this question : what are you doing here ?
whispered the young girls , stupefied : tis the captain ’ s name !
the outcasts , badly armed foamed and bit with rage
it is remarkable that these performances , tolerated and encouraged , no doubt , in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit , were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars
and you went to the barricades , and you got yourself killed out of malice !
she continued to talk to herself , with her head resting on the pillow : how happy we are going to be !
phoebus was no longer there
he said of them : they are peasants and not bourgeois ; that is the reason they are intelligent
it is well that he has placed himself there
the gypsy advanced towards the noble dame
one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up , and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether

a cloister , caught in the very act of asceticism , in the very heart of the city of 'number and of number and of number , rome blossoming out in paris , is an anachronism
the first bucketful emptied , the girl drew a second , then a third
madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time
and you are to be turned out of this one
every time that the city cuts a street , the sewer stretches out an arm
often , in the midst of his gravest souvenirs , after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent , he returned at night to his apartments , and there , exhausted with fatigue , overwhelmed with sleep , what did he do ?
pierre l ’ assommeur and baptiste croque-oison
marius , i have an idea
and so cold that the pen of the registrar of the parliament froze every three words , in the grand chamber !
patience for a little while longer
the night was starless and extremely dark
but , in any case , whatever may be the future of architecture , in whatever manner our young architects may one day solve the question of their art , let us , while waiting for new monument , preserve the ancient monuments
since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood , my son shall take it and bear it

to betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce community something of his own personality
no one has ever beheld such outbreaks among the students !
she had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of charles x , an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat , and the man 's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning
she said to him , she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed , will she not , sir ?
be easy , said bigrenaille to thenardier
the dinner , as we have said , was drawing to its close
marius waited for them all day in vain
he took a step and entered the room
the personage in black rose
this is the case with passive natures
then she examined her cell
fauchelevent 's confidence was perfect
nothing remained of the child , but one of her pretty little shoes
the royalists were becoming liberals , liberals were turning democrats
for cosette laughed now
there was no way of refusing
the law is only the law when entire
they are greatly in advance to be dead , he exclaimed
however , he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb , nor any man as much as an elzevir
they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise , a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it
the matter is very private
cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent
the archdeacon did not hear him
this caused another loss of twenty minutes ; but they set out again at a gallop
i will not come often
a moment more , and they would be gone
it seemed that this garden , created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries , had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries
the case opened by the pressure of a spring
neither were the people deceived thereby ; with any one who possessed any sagacity , quasimodo passed for the demon ; claude frollo , for the sorcerer
so he will come at six o'clock !
but one must practise a bit of hermetic science when one is only procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court , at thirty crowns tournois a year
but , from the very first day , that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl 's person , wounded jean valjean 's sombre eye
during the night which followed the execution of la esmeralda , the night men had detached her body from the gibbet , and had carried it , according to custom , to the cellar of montfauçon
when we select from it some one figure at random , and attempt to make it live again in thought , it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge
it is a matter easily understood
then she began to laugh again , and added : -do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today ?
the poor gypsy shivered when she beheld herself alone with this man
one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth , beyond which an open grave was visible
bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates
jean valjean fumbled in marius ' coat , pulled out his pocket-book , opened it at the page which marius had pencilled , and held it out to javert
it has just occurred to me !
the doctor had arrived too late
he has been recognized by four persons ; the old scamp will be condemned
he accorded him a little lofty pity
and while speaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing glance from the physician to his companion
the bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs ; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else
no one knows that this man is a gulf
the farm buildings border the courtyard on the south
he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue polonceau
he was an oracle everywhere
matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers
let 's have an end of this !
quasimodo contented himself with taking him by the girdle , and hurling him ten paces off amid the crowd ; all without uttering a word
that is why we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church , or we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church , which will be a good thing
he must have been very thirsty : for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink , two hundred paces further on , at the fountain in the market-place
gringoire tried to slip in some excuse between these curt words , which wrath rendered more and more jerky
i warn you so that you may be prepared
you will render me an account of it
fantine had remained alone
nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret
wellington felt that he was yielding
must we then retreat in pitiful fashion , like highwaymen ?
a passage broken , less than a minute was required for her to seize her daughter by the middle of her body , and draw her into her cell
thus the communication between him and them had been prompt , electric , and , so to speak , on a level
she was handling the flower instinctively , innocently , without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart
i have arranged my mode of life
she still cherishes , after her own number and our number , the feudal illusion
my own insult belongs to me , i think
have you done that , you wretch !
but the poor deaf man heard
this something or , rather , some one was a blind man , a little blind fellow with a bearded , jewish face , who , rowing away in the space about him with a stick , and towed by a large dog , droned through his nose with a hungarian accent : _facitote caritatem_ !
not one paving-stone projects beyond its neighbor
later on , this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten , and all this grace ends , with the bourgeois , on two legs , and with the tomcat , on four paws
we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the n 's from the bridge of jena !
had cast the stain of darkness into his heart , and had made a cain of this abel
on her side , cosette languished
jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man : charming !

if one succeeded in passing the porter , which was not easy , -- which was even nearly impossible for every one , for there was an open sesame !
the windows were immediately closed , and the poor bourgeois , who had hardly had time to cast a frightened glance on this scene of gleams and tumult , returned , perspiring with fear to their wives , asking themselves whether the witches ’ sabbath was now being held in the parvis of notre-dame , or whether there was an assault of burgundians , as in number then the husbands thought of theft ; the wives , of rape ; and all trembled

i want the superfluous , the useless , the extravagant , excess , that which serves no purpose
the man seemed engaged in prayer , according to his custom , and was much bent over
it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella
and the priest ’ s brow clouded over again
meanwhile , la esmeralda had remained standing
fantine was beautiful , without being too conscious of itthose rare dreamers , mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection , would have caught a glimpse in this little working-woman , through the transparency of her parisian grace , of the ancient sacred euphony

in the meantime a serious incident occurred
the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century , which here simulates an arcade , everything else having fallen prostrate around it
but the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time ; and , behold !
he refused the cross , he was appointed mayor

i will writhe on the earth , i will break the stones with my forehead , and i will damn myself , and i will curse you , lord , if you keep my child from me !
perhaps it would be wise to go abroad , if only for a few months , and to set out for london
the parvis was resplendent , and cast a radiance on the sky ; the bonfire lighted on the lofty platform was still burning , and illuminated the city far away
by one of those singular effects , which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies , in proportion as his revery continued , as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes , so did jean valjean grow less and vanish

the young girl ’ s attention had been attracted to him for the last few moments ; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness ; she had even once come to a standstill , and taking advantage of a ray of light which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently , from head to foot , then , having cast this glance , gringoire had seen her make that little pout which he had already noticed , after which she passed on

there is , then , an _i_
as it drew nearer , it assumed a form , and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition ; the mass grew white ; the day , which was slowly dawning , cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living , the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses , and this is what it proved to be : -seven wagons were driving in a file along the road
if he were splitting wood , he cut off a finger
enjolras , whose blue eye was not fixed on any one , and who seemed to be gazing at space , replied , without glancing at marius : -france needs no corsica to be great
remain gaping ; they hardly recognize him

marius paid attention to the manner of this man 's speech

in the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied : javert
are you going far ?
it was as though he had received a galvanic shock
marius had just emerged from his : night was falling
happy , even in the midst of anguish , is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness !
the fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass
he descended in all haste , and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du petit-banquier , on its way back to paris

he had been walking for about half an hour , at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind , and he had not yet thought of rest ; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius

still , she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair , beautiful eyes , handsome teeth , a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades , that he held himself badly when he walked , if you like , but with a grace that was all his own , that he did not appear to be at all stupid , that his whole person was noble , gentle , simple , proud , and that , in short , though he seemed to be poor , yet his air was fine
he knew italian , latin , greek , and hebrew ; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets : dante , juvenal , aeschylus , and isaiah
a sort of mud was found in his stomach
what did he say to her ?

the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases , hard to define , in which there is fatigue , buzzing , murmurs , sleep , tumult , and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place
i am quite sure that no charitable person wanted it
he who says love , says woman
abuses existed , i combated them ; tyrannies existed , i destroyed them ; rights and principles existed , i proclaimed and confessed them
and a tear trickled slowly down enjolras ' marble cheek
yes , replied the mother
i know not what is the matter with me

beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a poverty-stricken universe
greece crowned her mountains with a temple harmonious to the eye ; india disembowelled hers , to chisel therein those monstrous subterranean pagodas , borne up by gigantic rows of granite elephants
the police are on our heels
i simply require the discharge of inspector javert
and then he fell to weeping bitterly
what a far grander thing it is to love !
he advanced a step , in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay

he had become bankrupt , and was not to be found
it was in its place
he added , pointing to the stone gibbet

now , to our mind , in history , where kindness is the rarest of pearls , the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great
i order it , cried enjolras
i may meet them
the pavement is covered with rubbish ; ribbons , rags , feathers from tufts of plumes , drops of wax from the torches , crumbs of the public feast
by degrees , we will admit , a certain horror seized upon him
will you keep my child for me ?
it is the language of wretchedness
cosette had been obliged to give way
they might reply : that is because our barricade is made of good intentions

it is true that the night was very dark , that la esmeralda , if she had remained at her post ( and he had no doubt of this ) , was very far away , and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish the lovers on the balcony
the words which he uttered the most frequently were : the sensible man , and nature
they talked of one thing and another , without passion and with noise
on the one hand , he said , the functionary can make no mistake ; the magistrate is never the wrong
he covered his eyes with his large hand and retired once more , but slowly
that makes a lump that can be seen , said the inspector
and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders , and an indescribably exquisite pout , she glanced at marius
we will have a royal feast !
the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of judgment
fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality ; terror is mixed with it , an extenuating circumstance

a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages ; in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it
it was the face of the man with the butcher 's axe
jean valjean , with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of this departure , had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumet only at dusk , which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius
the forces of the gloom know each other , and are strangely balanced by each other
germany is the lymph , italy is the bile
little by little , the tide of houses , always thrust from the heart of the city outwards , overflows , devours , wears away , and effaces this wall
if he is jean valjean , he has his previous conviction against him
under the rue saint-denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii
he found himself , all at once , in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls , and beneath a vault which his head did not touch
this is what took place
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men , as we have already pointed out , and which , on occasion , extended even to things
la esmeralda , said the dancer , never taking her eyes from him
i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others
when she re-entered the audience hall , pale and limping , she was received with a general murmur of pleasure
her eyes were black and splendid ; in the midst of her black locks , some hairs through which the sun shone glistened like threads of gold

this ought , in fact , to render him recognizable
the inspector stared still more intently at marius , and continued with sententious solemnity : -there , you speak like a brave man , and like an honest man
the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes , and answered : -a gentleman of property , like yourself
a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips , and she had a black hole in her mouth
gisquette glanced at her and did the same
she could not endure that terrible face ; she felt her life quitting her ; she hid her face in both hands , and shrieked in her anguish : -monsieur madeleine , save me !
he was on the point of turning round , when a paper folded in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head
still , in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau , he thought he felt certain that no one was following him

make its contour float in a winter ’ s mist which clings to its numerous chimneys ; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices ; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers ; or take that black silhouette again , enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables , and make it start out more toothed than a shark ’ s jaw against a copper-colored western sky , -- and then compare
and then he runs the risk of getting crushed !
and this soul , found and tested , is a woman

thoughts made their appearance on these faces ; it was a terrible moment ; visible demons with their masks removed , fierce souls laid bare
tholomyes replied to none of them

the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin , and it is probable that this personage , who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians , would be no less fine a prize for the authorities
the sister dared not question the mayor ; but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there
had himself sculptured on his knees before the virgin , and whither he caused to be brought , without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of royal statues , the statues of charlemagne and of saint louis , two saints whom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven , as kings of france

four virgins walked in advance
as for mother hucheloup , she 's an old warrior
you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champmathieu affair , that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury , that the name of fauchelevent had been given to me by fauchelevent himself , out of gratitude for a service rendered to him , and that i might assuredly keep it , and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me , that i should not be in any one 's way , that i should be in my own little corner , and that , while you would have cosette , i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her

at certain points , there were precipices
after the expiration of a few moments , do what he would , he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened , saying that which he would have preferred to ignore , and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear , yielding to that mysterious power which said to him : think !

charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous grimace of a poet in search of a rhyme
he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building ; he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise
apart from the revolution , which , taken as a whole , is an immense human affirmation , 'number is , alas !
he retraced his steps , he called , he did not find them ; he reflected that they must already be far away , put the package in his pocket , and went off to dine

some abominable fright that will make us shudder , probably !
what he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age , it was the mysterious mark of death
then he withdrew behind the cart , with his men in livery surcoats
compassion , which is the same thing as clemency , causeth the love of subjects , which is the most powerful bodyguard to a prince
in the good humor of that winter of number , paris had disguised itself as venice
did not he fall into the trap !
a huge cellar had been constructed there , closed by an old iron grating , which was out of order , into which were cast not only the human remains , which were taken from the chains of montfauçon , but also the bodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent gibbets of paris
the woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart , which is infallible
brother , replied the scholar , making an effort to assume a decent , pitiful , and modest mien , and twirling his cap in his hands with an innocent air ; i am come to ask of you --
he recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the rue polonceau eight years before , and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape ; it was difficult then , to-day it was impossible
mutilations , amputations , dislocation of the joints , restorations ; this is the greek , roman , and barbarian work of professors according to vitruvius and vignole
he had a pocket-book about him ; the same one which had contained the note-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for cosette
the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning ; after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock and midnight , nothing more has taken place ; the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak ; but that makes no difference , from the moment when that man is concerned in this war , he is lost ; he is caught in the gearing
it 's you , you scamp ?
he cast his eyes about him ; but there was no hope : all were laughing
however , manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg saint-marceau
they retraced their steps
leave me alone a little !
was it a fortress ?
if it were thus , -- as there comes in all human society a moment when the sacred symbol is worn out and becomes obliterated under freedom of thought , when man escapes from the priest , when the excrescence of philosophies and systems devour the face of religion , -- architecture could not reproduce this new state of human thought ; its leaves , so crowded on the face , would be empty on the back ; its work would be mutilated ; its book would be incomplete
has monsieur le maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter ?
from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which , arrested there in its passage , no doubt , had floated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart
she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance
this had given her , when very young , and even a little later , a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband , a scamp of a certain depth , a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar , coarse and fine at one and the same time , but , so far as sentimentalism was concerned , given to the perusal of pigault-lebrun , and in what concerns the sex , as he said in his jargon -- a downright , unmitigated lout
he proposed , and she agreed
bind me as you please , but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man
in truth , i think a great deal of that child
a national guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras , lowered his gun , saying : it seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower
enjolras was the chief , combeferre was the guide , courfeyrac was the centre
how could you go to live in a street like that , which is sickly , which is disagreeable , which is ugly , which has a barrier at one end , where one is cold , and into which one can not enter ?
a moment later he turned the corner of the rue des precheurs
from that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could
how am i to pay them ?
he wrote the following letter to fantine 's dictation , and made her sign it : -you will deliver cosette to this person
what do you mean to say ?
and the cathedral was not only society for him , but the universe , and all nature beside
there is one thing sadder than to see one 's children die ; it is to see them leading an evil life
that which had been merely illustrious , had become august
there are thoughts which play us the same trick ; they nestle awayin a corner of our brain ; that is the end of them ; they are lost ; it is impossible to lay the memory on them
he is not responsible to men
in what way did you go thither ?
the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner ; it devours , it eats flesh , it drinks blood ; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter , a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
in a relative measure , and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled , the exception is just
and he thought no more about it
take a few steps , and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe , where ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of ivry to the sound of thunder , as in the melodramas
in the gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede a wedding
mon coeur un beau jour s'envola
a strange shade , gradually drawing nearer , extended little by little over men , over things , over ideas ; a shade which came from wraths and systems
tiny feet that people came even from epernay , which is seven leagues away , to see !
it is a serious matter
but not a spark of gold
one of the survivors of this expedition , an intelligent workingman , who was very young at the time , related curious details with regard to it , several years ago , which bruneseau thought himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police , as unworthy of official style
he had no children
then he returned to the barricade and said : it is done
he was very gay , but one felt the force of government in him ; there was dictation in his joviality ; his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of nankeen , with straps of braided copper wire ; he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand , and , as he treated himself to everything , a strange thing called a cigar in his mouthnothing was sacred to him ; he smoked
paris alone has this in its natural history
he had entered in despair ; he emerged gloomy
that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
and he seated himself , utterly breathless , wiping away the great drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched , like tears , the parchments spread out before him
cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed
jean valjean tottered , dropped the blotter , and fell into the old arm-chair beside the buffet , with drooping head , and glassy eyes , in utter bewilderment
at the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to traverse
the tavern-keeper is there , said montparnasse
with this he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes
it is not time
however , the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety , her daintiness , her lively manners , her dances , and her songs
they do not consent to be black
if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind , you are deserving of pity ; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and of peace , you are more worthy than any one of us
at the moment when that name , which he had buried beneath so many layers , was so strangely articulated , he was struck with stupor , and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny ; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks
an ashy gleam dimly lighted this scene , and the gallows grew more and more distinct in the square
i love you -- do not open your mouth ; refrain from speaking to me rather , if it be only to tell me that you hate me
from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which , ten years before , cosette had quitted montfermeil ; first the little gown , then the black fichu , then the stout , coarse child 's shoes which cosette might almost have worn still , so tiny were her feet , then the fustian bodice , which was very thick , then the knitted petticoat , next the apron with pockets , then the woollen stockings
she had a great deal of fever that day
the raven flies only by day , the owl flies only by night , the swan flies by day and by night
this is what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous
marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him
do you think so ?
monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money
he was utterly upset , he would have liked to be very handsome , he would have liked to own the cross
there was no means of opening the gate
by dint of ransacking his memory , he recalled in a vague way that he had already , many years before , had a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect that he might well be this very individual
the eye was , for a long time , wholly lost in this labyrinth , where there was nothing which did not possess its originality , its reason , its genius , its beauty , -- nothing which did not proceed from art ; beginning with the smallest house , with its painted and carved front , with external beams , elliptical door , with projecting stories , to the royal louvre , which then had a colonnade of towers
since that time , two powerful romancers , one of whom is a profound observer of the human heart , the other an intrepid friend of the people , balzac and eugene sue , having represented their ruffians as talking their natural language , as the author of theday of a condemned man did in number , the same objections have been raised
well , what of that ?
god preserve me from it !
the sky had been overcast all day long
they form a part of his laboratory
monseigneur , he asked , where am i to enter ?
among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds , there was one sceptic
happily , an unexpected incident came to his rescue
his father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence , but by whom ?
the courageous took to arms , the poltroons hid
that is to say : enter
the priest interrupted him : is it agreed
the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window , and shouted to her in a thundering voice : -quick !
all at once , she burst into tears
they would not allow the child to come into the printing office , because he was in the way , they said
that is legal and delightful
now , according to local tradition , this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered number-number on the boulevard de l'hopital
we do not know where we are to sleep , replied the elder
j'ai froid , ma mere
the elder of the two children , who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood , uttered this exclamation : -it 's queer , all the same
this struck him as strange ; usually , there was no noise in m madeleine 's chamber until he rose in the morning
he 's in the first carriage
but the author is far from regarding as accomplished , the task which he has voluntarily imposed on himself
; bailiffs , aldermen , burgomasters ; burgomasters , aldermen , bailiffs -- all stiff , affectedly grave , formal , dressed out in velvet and damask , hooded with caps of black velvet , with great tufts of cyprus gold thread ; good flemish heads , after all , severe and worthy faces , of the family which rembrandt makes to stand out so strong and grave from the black background of his night patrol ; personages all of whom bore , written on their brows , that maximilian of austria had done well in trusting implicitly , as the manifest ran , in their sense , valor , experience , loyalty , and good wisdom
this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent
one of the sergeants of police was obliged to notify master charmolue of the fact , as the latter , during this entire scene , had been engaged in studying the bas-relief of the grand portal which represents , according to some , the sacrifice of abraham ; according to others , the philosopher ’ s alchemical operation : the sun being figured forth by the angel ; the fire , by the fagot ; the artisan , by abraham
twas he who pushed us on hither , and he has deserted us in the very middle of the job !
that 's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way !
will not that suffice you ?
these fishwife vehicles , in which one feels one knows not what shadows , set the philosopher to thinking
the one is magnificent , the other sublime
for , let us insist upon this point , masonry must not be thought to be powerful only in erecting the temple and in expressing the myth and sacerdotal symbolism ; in inscribing in hieroglyphs upon its pages of stone the mysterious tables of the law
it is worth the journey
he did that to spite me !
he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story , which ended in the abduction of a child
these lofty deeds of rascality have no future
but a humid warmth near his ear , which the mouth of the wounded man touched , indicated respiration , and consequently , life
all at once , towards the end of february , number , it was discovered that brujon , that somnolent fellow , had had three different commissions executed by the errand-men of the establishment , not under his own name , but in the name of three of his comrades ; and they had cost him in all fifty sous , an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal
good , you can laugh , you are not speaking seriously
a very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways
what my brother does is well done
they entangled him under a fresh system of thongs and buckles ; he allowed them to bind and buckle him
he started , for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the rue plumet
when they had finished , when they had told each other everything , she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him : -what is your name ?
by the way , dom claude , i bring you a colleague who has desired to see you on account of your reputation
one can almost see distinctly there
have you no longer any kind feeling for your father ?
fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent
they laid gavroche on the same table with mabeuf , and spread over the two corpses the black shawl
what was the number ?
and , then , they drive at a walk
destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences , differing in age , alike in sorrow
absorbed in cosette , he had not even clearly put it to himself that this eponine was named eponine thenardier , and that she bore the name inscribed in his father 's will , that name , for which , but a few months before , he would have so ardently sacrificed himself
nevertheless , he advanced as rapidly as possible
hence we accept it and we adopt it , like all the rest of the world , to characterize the architecture of the second half of the middle ages , where the ogive is the principle which succeeds the architecture of the first period , of which the semi-circle is the father
this was a touching and august instant , all heads uncovered , all hearts beat high
this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable ; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion
he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment , and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated ; but if he had been strongly pressed , it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican
there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the baker 's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary 's
he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring
his eyes were deep , his lids a little red , his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful , his brow was lofty
this recurred to his mind unceasingly
it certainly was not ursule
i always thought there was some evil history back of all that
from time to time she heard the loud laughter , the noisy voice of quasimodo in her ear ; she half opened her eyes ; then below her she confusedly beheld paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and tiles , like a red and blue mosaic , above her head the frightful and joyous face of quasimodo
on the same day when the papal nuncio , on the one hand , and the cardinal de la roche-aymon on the other , both devoutly kneeling , were each engaged in putting on , in his majesty 's presence , a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry , who had just got out of bed
as soon as enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end , the din of strife ceased in the room , and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity
he inquired of another pupil , a charming brunette with rosy cheeks , who stood near him : -who is that ?
they aimed at him constantly , and always missed him
behold him in the sand up to his belly , the sand reaches to his breast , he is only a bust now
she was learned , erudite , wise , competent , curiously proficient in history , crammed with latin , stuffed with greek , full of hebrew , and more of a benedictine monk than a benedictine nun
the reader has probably not forgotten that a part of the cour de miracles was enclosed by the ancient wall which surrounded the city , a goodly number of whose towers had begun , even at that epoch , to fall to ruin
the years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment
under the axle-tree hung , like drapery , a huge chain , worthy of some goliath of a convict
that shoe has so much grace and daintiness , it is so impossible for it to walk , that it seems to the mother as though she saw her child
one morning , this spy saw jean valjean , with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar , entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel
what do you want ?
a subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable
the archdeacon and the gypsy had come into conflict in his heart
when he cried , sinite parvulos , he made no distinction between the little children
by any other route than that below plancenoit , the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery , and bulow would not have arrived
hide in your chamber , so that you may be supposed to have gone out
the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him
the recluse remained for several moments motionless and petrified , then she moved her head in sign of doubt , and suddenly giving vent to a burst of laughter , but with that terrible laugh which had come back to her , --
and then , as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back , there is no longer any one at faverolles who knew jean valjean
a terrible moment ensued , during which the poor portress felt as though she should faint
resumed gringoire , growing warmer and warmer , and supposing that , after all , he had to deal merely with a virtue of the cour des miracles ; am i not thine , sweet friend , art thou not mine ?
he raised his glance to the crucifix
there were some people standing about
some people maintained that he was a mysterious person , and that no one ever entered his chamber , which was a regular anchorite 's cell , furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of dead men !
and without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him !
he did not kill javert , but he is a murderer
when one knows how to look , one finds the spirit of a century , and the physiognomy of a king , even in the knocker on a door
he must rest for two days at least
there , trembling lest the aunt should turn round , concealed behind a pillar , motionless , not daring to breathe , he gazed at his child
some said that she had been seen to quit reims at nightfall by the fléchembault gate ; others , at daybreak , by the old basée gate
ask that demagogue of a marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a cosette
there is a spectacle more grand than the sea ; it is heaven : there is a spectacle more grand than heaven ; it is the inmost recesses of the soul
he loved the word citizen , but he preferred the word man
the road was so narrow at the braine-l'alleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart , as is proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery , and which gives the name of the dead , monsieur bernard debrye , merchant of brussels , and the date of the accident , february , number
her magnificent blond hair was plaited in a ravishing manner , she was dressed entirely in that sky blue which becomes fair people so well , a bit of coquetry which she had learned from colombe , and her eyes were swimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better
said robin poussepain still all bruised with his fall
even family names have disappeared
the same sack on their backs , the same rope around their loins
to lie is the absolute form of evil
the old man exclaimed , without either waiting for or hearing her response : -what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor , and that i cando nothing for you !
the aspect of the locality has changed
this , replied fauchelevent , is so that i may be avoided
at last i behold happiness close beside me !
said gringoire , to the archdeacon
as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle , it is called without distinction , to make reparation or to be at the post
the edifice had also sounds fraught with such benediction and such majesty , that they soothed this ailing soul
it 's idiotic ; you looked like a calf
then the women laughed and wept , the crowd stamped with enthusiasm , for , at that moment quasimodo had a beauty of his own
in good faith , perchance , and deceiving itself , devotee that it is
for the due de modena , speaks slang
without a card , he could not get back into the cemetery
the immaculate one is there , and very fierce
from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers
the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy
the arms of mothers are made of tenderness ; in them children sleep profoundly
bareheaded , he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house
in plain sight , on the open boulevard , he placed one knee on the ground , shouldered his weapon , fired , killed the commander of the squadron , and turned away , saying : there 's another who will do us no more harm
this perhaps , so dear to philosophers , emboldened gringoire
the escort troop cursed , the men in chains did not utter a syllable ; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls ; some of these men were yawning ; their rags were terrible ; their feet hung down , their shoulders oscillated , their heads clashed together , their fetters clanked , their eyes glared ferociously , their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses ; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter
he has been in the galleys , said thenardier
his father had ended by owning a house and a field ; but he , the son , had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation
but the task of sages is one thing , the task of clever men is another
as for convents , they present a complex problem , -- a question of civilization , which condemns them ; a question of liberty , which protects them
this impression had even one stronger and more profound point about it , that it was indeed the tower of strasbourg , but the tower of strasbourg two leagues in height ; something unheard of , gigantic , immeasurable ; an edifice such as no human eye has ever seen ; a tower of babel
enjolras was a chief , combeferre was a guide
the retort was a harsh one , but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel
that must have been blachevelle 's idea , resumed favourite
beside her shadow , the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow , which was particularly startling and terrible , a shadow which had a round hat
i think i should have done better to strain my onions
before he had finished the exordium , the perspiration was starting from his brow , and his eyes from his bead
this wall hears , sees and will not
according to the philosophers , the eternal father ; according to the jacobins , the supreme being
his mouth is unstopped at last
he perceived from the king ’ s cold and indifferent mien that there was no other resource than something very pathetic , and he flung himself at the feet of louis xi , exclaiming , with gestures of despair : --
the hell where you are , shall he paradise ; the sight of you is more charming than that of god !
the dinner is paid for
a satin pelisse , a velvet bonnet , boots , and everything ; more than two hundred francs ' worth of clothes !
to-day , it is my turn ; i am going to eat the gypsy -- oh !
a series of faint , sharp noises resounded confusedly along the wall of paving-stones
if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history , the one would have been the just , the other the wise man
it would be a good thing to have two men for it
the flour is no fault of ours
that 's why we get on well together , my coat and i
in houses where people are among themselves , i am superfluous
at this oath , which was the favorite of louis xi , some one seemed to awaken in the interior of the cage ; the sound of chains was heard , grating on the floor , and a feeble voice , which seemed to issue from the tomb was uplifted
the advocate ’ s trade taketh all the grain , and leaveth only straw to the other scientific professions
rosier than the satin of the shoes !
marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father , and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying
when the door was barricaded , enjolras said to the others : let us sell our lives dearly
accordingly , he assumed an extremely soft tone and began , --
but he suffered ; he suffered so that at intervals he tore out handfuls of his hair to see whether it were not turning white
you shall come when you will , he continued , turning to tourangeau , i will show you the little parcels of gold which remained at the bottom of nicholas flamel ’ s alembic , and you shall compare them with the gold of guillaume de paris
the populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence
there is also a rascal of a tree which is called the lewd , because it favored the pleasures of a famous princess and a constable of france , who was a gallant and a wit -- alas !
these poor living beings , these creatures of god , henceforth without support , without guide , without refuge , wandered away at random , -- who even knows ? -- each in his own direction perhaps , and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies ; gloomy shades , into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads , in the sombre march of the human race
one day , the air was warm , the luxembourg was inundated with light and shade , the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning , the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees
i know not , said he
it is a perpetual i love you
he did not succeed in this
and how about food ?
shrieked boulatruelle , shaking his fist at the horizon
said the king , between two swallows of his ptisan
between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference -- that its logic may end in war , whereas its philosophy can end only in peace
he was barricading himself against possibilities
the ensemble was glacial , regular , hideous
the government sends a coffin
and they would rush off !
the reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the _i_
enjolras held a pistol in his hand
let me climb up , m'sieu le gendarme , said the gamin
with that poor marius
she was declared an orphan , both father and mother being dead
why , argot is horrible !
cosette , this paper will be found ; this is what i wish to say to thee , thou wilt see the figures , if i have the strength to recall them , listen well , this money is really thine
nothing was known about her , save that she was mad , and that in the world she passed for dead
he paid no heed to the portress 's words , but went to bed and to sleep
maskers abounded on the boulevard
what i can do , by the way , is to come in the afternoon , when night is beginning to fall
this attack , which was more furious than serious , irritated enjolras -- the fools !
he stood motionless , and did not relax his hold on montparnasse
one has assuredly the right , after all , to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse
i drink water -- i am overwhelmed with remorse and with creditors
he waited , in the hope of some incident , no matter of what nature , since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide
to escape him , but immediately suppressed it , and shaking montparnasse 's hand : -well , good evening , said he , i am going off to my elephant with my brats
i leave this very evening , aunt
there is will in thought , there is none in dreams
what was there to be seen there ?
all the female servants in his house were called nicolette ( even the magnon , of whom we shall hear more farther on )
then he set to work
there was no reply
not at all , said jehan wisely
the adorable young girl , whom marius , in his heart , called his ursule , approached her hastily
fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her : reflect , my beauty !
however , the peril was urgent , the last bounds of delay had been reached ; thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner
which do you prefer , descartes or spinoza ?
the man raised his eyes
we are but a poor country here
the love of a damned soul
two men who have been friends become two chance passers-by
how old is she ?
nature , as we have elsewhere said , looks before her
there was a celebrated fourier at the academy of science , whom posterity has forgotten ; and in some garret an obscure fourier , whom the future will recalllord byron was beginning to make his mark ; a note to a poem by millevoye introduced him to france in these terms : a certain lord baron
ask nicolette , who has not left you for a moment , if there was any possibility of having a woman here
thereupon he set out again on a run
the barricade will probably be blockaded , all the streets will be guarded , and you will not be able to get out
there is a divine right in louis xvi , there is because a bourbon in louis philippe ; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right , and , in order to clear away universal insurrection , they must be combated ; it must be done , france being always the one to begin
the carriage drove off
the recluse rushed upon her daughter with a roar of agony
to measure the great toe of the foot is to measure the giant
on the way thither , he encountered courfeyrac , and pretended not to see him
the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented ; a ray of vivid light , a ray of the true light of the living , suddenly penetrated within him
quasimodo , the object of the tumult , still stood on the threshold of the chapel , sombre and grave , and allowed them to admire him
only , the wounded man did not stir , and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse
he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds , who was coming there to live with his little daughter
meanwhile , enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his embrasure
the night promised to be as arid as the day had been
it was high time , for all the devotees were already licking their chops over the fine , flaming fagot
an assassin , because he assassinated police-agent javert
monsieur , said gringoire , i thank you !
the tone in which she pronounced these words made even henriet cousin shudder
the coachman humbly represented to monsieur l'inspecteur , that the utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the assassinated man , and with mire from the assassin
it is the liberty of architecture
there was nothing before them , nothing behind
nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother , who had also just fallen asleep
at last it reached the ground , the horrible cry arose , and the black beam , as it rebounded from the pavement , resembled a serpent leaping
only at a distance , at the summit of that one of the towers of notre-dame which commands the grève , two men outlined in black against the light morning sky , and who seemed to be looking on , were visible
as they advance themselves , they cause their satellites to progress also ; it is a whole solar system on the march
quasimodo who did not hear , saw the naked swords , the torches , the irons of the pikes , all that cavalry , at the head of which he recognized captain phoebus ; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts , the terror of some , the disturbance among the bravest of them , and from this unexpected succor he recovered so much strength , that he hurled from the church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery
death has a fashion of harassing victory , and she causes the pest to follow glory
said charmolue to pierrat
m gillenormand began to pace back and forth , his hands in his pockets , talking aloud , and twitching , with his irritated old fingers , at the two watches which he wore in his two fobs
they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death , and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows
at first sight one took her for a spectre ; at the second , for a statue
but how was she to get the letter to the post ?
on the contrary , he reassured her
magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves
jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent , a pile of fagots , and , behind the fagots , directly against the wall , a stone statue , whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom
the author of this book , who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself , has been absent from paris for many years
nevertheless , the grand hall was anything but olympus , and gringoire ’ s poor jupiter knew it better than any one else
at bottom , she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father ; but she loved her husband still more dearly
the bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people
i am examining the chiselling of these stones , and the manner in which yonder bas-relief is thrown out
so saying , she turned to the inspector again : -and yet , you see , mr

the other did not perceive it
all at once , jondrette lifted up his voice : -by the way !
just see if those boobies will put themselves out !
this secret is worth massive gold
his massive couch , all covered with gilding , with great branches of lilies painted on the panels , thundered noisily along
he had allowed himself to be led , pushed , carried , lifted , bound , and bound again
the bearded man had on a fez , the other 's head was bare , and the snow had lodged in his hair
the passers-by stared at him in surprise , and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister
grouchy hoped for , blucher arriving
he counts for something with them ; they are what a philosopher would call , bespattered with the title , and that flatters them
hence phoebus believed poor similar to be dead , and that a month or two had elapsed since her death
one might as well seek the name of every cloud in the sky
fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name of the victim who passed by at the corner of the street , and it was the populace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare
thought gavroche , that name is a perfect farce
who was that child ?
why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons ?
jean valjean was hurt by this sadness , and heart-broken at this gentleness
it was high time ; one minute more , and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss
besides , observed a voice in one group , it is easy enough to talk about leaving
quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled
he called his species of work , for which he possessed special aptitude , shaving barbers
the obstacle was invincible
she dared make herself no promises , and she did not wish to refuse herself anything
a joyous ray of the rising sun entered through her window and touched her face
it is the country of jet
fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter ; how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing 's worth of millet every two days ; how to make a coverlet of one 's petticoat , and a petticoat of one 's coverlet ; how to save one 's candle , by taking one 's meals by the light of the opposite window
there is a revolt !
it strikes me , i say , that you heard the clatter of their wooden shoes fleeing southward , while you were fleeing northward
love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages
the case has been taken to the assizes at arras
he bristled up in hideous wise ; nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy ; their terrified air evokes terror
then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench , to m leblanc and his daughter , and went home
he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard , and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him
then he continued his ascent
sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on
what , -- all this was real !
that was the greatest of sacrifices , the most poignant of victories , the last step to take ; but it must be done
the steps of the patrol became more and more distinct
where , then , is the ship ?
then he raised his voice : -citizens !
the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long
if perpetual motion is impossible , can perpetual self-sacrifice be exacted ?
this sufficed him for his living
i have nothing to sell but cart-wheels
there are _voulgiers , cranequiniers_ and hand _couleveiniers_
she dropped her eyes , and he pursued his way
during thunder storms , he felt his pulse
all are bound to go out through the chimney
moreover , this is an offence which concerns me
the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned
the man recovered his animation as he ate
i tell you that you must try to learn for me what that wedding is , who that old cove belongs to , and where that wedding pair lives
it also frequently happened , that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar , and in that case , woe to the sewermen
let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated
what are your wrongs with regard to me ?
two gentlemen among these knaves !
louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century , and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little , and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful
all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age , which are decrepitude , decay , ruin , and sadness
that is , at least , what was supposed , whether rightly or not
one of them holds possession of the tuileries , one of them is giving philibert delorme a scar across the middle of his face ; and it is not , assuredly , one of the least of the scandals of our time to see with what effrontery the heavy architecture of this gentleman is being flattened over one of the most delicate façades of the renaissance !
hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of messire robert
come along , said courfeyrac
the cloud of spectators followed , jesting , in a paroxysm of delight
his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation
how do you know that it was the same fiacre ?
chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks
good brother claude , resumed jehan , emboldened by this smile , look at my worn out boots
the emperor , greatly pleased , shouted to him : you are a colonel , you are a baron , you are an officer of the legion of honor !
my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days , four persons and my spouse ill
there is one yonder , under the shed of the pillar-house , replied the man
the house was occupied , in fact
madame magloire , said he , fetch me a chair
we have all forgotten him completely
javert replied , his face incorruptible , and as melancholy as ever : -mr mayor , the truth is the truth
the criminal advocate , monsieur philippe lheulier , nevertheless , knows a little hebrew , which he learned in that matter of the jews of the rue kantersten , at brussels
when he had any one to dinner , madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table
he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger
here objections spring up afresh
i am bought by the government for to-day
we shall be at peace here for to-day ; but i will not answer for to-morrow
i am going to make a confession to you
you do not know that i am an old coward
he felt that he had been uprooted
to realize one 's dream
do these women think ?
she always occupied it alone because this gallery , being on the level of the first story , the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen , which was interdicted to the nuns
when he descended from the scaffold , there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass
they set off once more in the direction of the bastille
in this chamber , nothing was to be found of what furnishes ordinary apartments , neither benches , nor trestles , nor forms , nor common stools in the form of a chest , nor fine stools sustained by pillars and counter-pillars , at four sols a piece
now , we ask , which of the three arts has really represented human thought for the last three centuries ?
as you please , monseigneur
a battalion of the numberth light came at a run from saint-denis , the numberth of the line arrived from courbevoie , the batteries of the military school had taken up their position on the carrousel ; cannons were descending from vincennes
the insignificant testament , the last dotage of a decrepit grand art falling back into infancy before it dies
marius thought he had encountered a wag , the beginning of a mystification in the open street
sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy , and haughty condescension and malevolent looks
a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience
are you scoffing at me ?
this grating , made of stout , transverse bars , was about two feet square
poor jupiter , haggard , frightened , pale beneath his rouge , dropped his thunderbolt , took his cap in his hand ; then he bowed and trembled and stammered : his eminence -- the ambassadors -- madame marguerite of flanders --
he took her up and carried her again
his breathing was hoarse , his face livid , his limbs flaccid , his belly prominent
the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d'etat
alike in appearance , fundamentally different in reality ; the swiss defend the false , bonaparte defends the true
in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy , the egotism of priviliged authors , may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre , for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which new-comers are treated
there was logic in his nature , as there is in ours
he returned towards the marble table , and saw that the representation had been interrupted
he felt that , since such men were to die , their death ought to be a masterpiece
first it was the young vicomte de cormontreuil , who has his bell tower three leagues distant from reims ; then messire henri de triancourt , equerry to the king ; then less than that , chiart de beaulion , sergeant-at-arms ; then , still descending , guery aubergeon , carver to the king ; then , mace de frépus , barber to monsieur the dauphin ; then , thévenin le moine , king ’ s cook ; then , the men growing continually younger and less noble , she fell to guillaume racine , minstrel of the hurdy gurdy and to thierry de mer , lamplighter
i catch a glimpse , i do not contemplate !
the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne
that was the day of the galland indies
and behold , that terrible hand , the police , darts from the darkness , and abruptly tears off my mask !
one would have said that something dark was descending upon her
he sat there on the post of his door , motionless as a form of ice
i do not read , i spell out !
we have seen , of the flowers , and the swallows , the setting sun and the rising moon , and all sorts of important things
somewhat as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg , and with the most delicate impertinence
however , it is the same nowadays ; every wise man ’ s mouth complimenting another wise man is a vase of honeyed gall
every one took him for the judge , and with good reason
the gypsy walked slowly towards the door , without making any reply
he raised his eyes , and at the extremity of the vault , far , very far away in front of him , he perceived a light
when she passed the factory in working hours , when the workpeople were at the door , she affected to laugh and sing
his breakfast was served ; he seized the bread , took a mouthful , and then slowly replaced it on the table , and did not touch it again
the policemen trooped in in force , and in a few seconds javert 's order had been executed
jehan prepared himself for a rough shock , but the deaf man remained motionless ; only he had turned towards the scholar and was looking at him
make of it , soiling not , spoiling not , a petticoat fair with its bodice fine , which i will embroider and fill with flowers
why do you say , ah ?
if the decision has been to go barefoot , all go barefoot
she has not even trousers
the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs
progress is an honest man ; the ideal and the absolute do not filch pocket-handkerchiefs
in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron , ornamented above with two garlanded vases , and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf , which was a sort of episcopal luxury ; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper , with the silver worn off , fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen ; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand , loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes ; before the table an arm-chair of straw ; in front of the bed a prie-dieu , borrowed from the oratory
it was mother crucifixion
this bandit refused to defend himself
but he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold , because he could not afford a carriage , and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors
but , in the first place , what is power ?
the prisoner uttered not a syllable
if nature calls itself providence , society should call itself foresight
the real human division is this : the luminous and the shady
the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery
let us enter , nevertheless
this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans , his combinations , his scaffoldings , his projects for the future
conclusion : we remain , said laigle
as yet , nothing had come
to be a false signature in flesh and blood , to be a living false key , to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock , never more to look straightforward , to forever eye askance , to be infamous within the _i_ , no !
as he passed the door of the bell chamber , which was ajar , he saw something which struck him ; he beheld quasimodo , who , leaning through an opening of one of those slate penthouses which resemble enormous blinds , appeared also to be gazing at the place
marius had momentarily forgotten all this ; in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning , what he had done , where he had breakfasted , nor who had spoken to him ; he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought ; he only existed at the hours when he saw cosette
there is at least that much gained
they entered the carriage once more , and the coachman mounted his box
yes , sir , i am
and for the sake of obeying her father , she resumed her walks in the garden , generally alone , for , as we have mentioned , jean valjean , who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence , hardly ever went there
i said to myself hastily : here 's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out
cosette ventured to emerge from her hole
to paint with words , which contains figures one knows not how or why , is the primitive foundation of all human languages , what may be called their granite
the other end , which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of chelles , found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope , near the road to chelles , about a quarter of an hour from montfermeil
who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her ?
they were cruel and graceful ; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel
bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow
farewell all sap , all originality , all life , all intelligence
gavroche , completely carried away and radiant , had undertaken to get everything in readiness
it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed , which suddenly comes to a dead stop
do not get mad , come with us , let 's go drink a bottle of old wine together
at this abrupt query , the man started
at last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied , but which was triumphant , in reality
when you utter that name , unhappy girl , it is as though you crushed all the fibres of my heart between your teeth
you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready
an ancient burgundian coin
there are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot
he took the candlestick in his right hand ; holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread , he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room , occupied by the bishop , as we already know
maitre renard was less lucky ; all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r , and to call himself prenard ; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first
a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head , descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor , where it stopped
then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge ?
i know not , said fleur-de-lys ; it appears that a witch is to do penance this morning before the church , and thereafter to be hung
she had recognized the fact that all around her was wall , that below her there was a pavement covered with moisture and a truss of straw ; but neither lamp nor air-hole
the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden
you are an honest man , and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you
at certain hours , everything seems impossible , at others everything appears easy ; jean valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours
if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore , what is it in a cess-pool ?
at the same time , the priest flung jehan a purse , which gave the scholar a big bump on the forehead , and with which jehan retreated , both vexed and content , like a dog who had been stoned with marrow bones
he said , the faults of women , of children , of the feeble , the indigent , and the ignorant , are the fault of the husbands , the fathers , the masters , the strong , the rich , and the wise
marius ' two arms were passed round his neck , and the former 's feet dragged behind him
replied coppenole , tis not very difficult
they will give back cosette , for they have been paid ; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay
the old witch with a white moustache would not trust me
he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile , and he exclaimed , without , however , raising his tone : apropos of that quagmire , you are a hearty animal
a quarter of a league further on , he arrived at the bottom of alittle valley , where there is water which passes beneath an archmade through the embankment of the road
one word resembles a claw , another an extinguished and bleeding eye , such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab
est modus in rebus
joly deposited a kiss on mame hucheloup 's fat , red , wrinkled neck , and said to grantaire : my dear fellow , i have always regarded a woman 's neck as an infinitely delicate thing
these young folks are on the way to be married ; they are about to enter the serious part of life
before entering the restaurant room , the visitor read on the door the following line written there in chalk by courfeyrac : -- regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses
jean valjean resumed : what do you say to that ?
good virgin , have pity upon me
is not this second infinite , so to speak , subjacent to the first ?
and the grandfather says : that 's a simple matter
he looks and is on the verge of laughter ; he is on the verge of something else also
here thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door , and added with a shudder : -when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler !
her ailing brain comprehended nothing , but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her
there is an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell tower
here he has been pursuing me , threatening me , terrifying me for months !
the painter who says : my grinder , the notary who says : my skip-the-gutter , the hairdresser who says : my mealyback , the cobbler who says : my cub , talks slang
marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory
but i do not like the benches in the galleries
moreover , cosette was not very timid by nature
and so it goes on
all was stone around him ; before his eyes , gaping monsters ; below , quite at the bottom , in the place , the pavement ; above his head , quasimodo weeping
i may , perhaps , be in haste
in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck , he admitted the active principle , he admitted the passive principle , and he tried to reach a balance
i swear it to you by the angels of paradise
she wrote often , and this was noticed
sometimes at eventide , in the twilight , at an hour when the garden was deserted , he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel , in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival , and turned towards the spot where , as he knew , the sister was making reparation , prostrated in prayer
on its brow it bore the star , liberty
the living perceive the infinite ; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead
babylon has no ideal ; carthage has no ideal
now , get away with you
scepticism , that caries of the intelligence , had not left him a single whole idea
in the meantime , public minor had informed the archdeacon of the miraculous manner in which the gypsy had been saved
down with jupiter and the cardinal de bourbon !
we are going to fling the government to the earth
you are a wheelwright ?
at that moment fleur-de-lys noticed a little bag of embroidered leather suspended from the neck of the goat , -- what is that ?
the spanish convent was , above all others , the catholic convent
i kissed thy fresh round arms in haste
a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house
he lent an ear
you are small , said enjolras , you will not be seen
in questions of famine , riot , buzancais , for example , holds a true , pathetic , and just point of departure
beside the bed , three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out
the sun had set
it was the scholar , who , ill at ease , and greatly bored in his hiding-place , had succeeded in discovering there a stale crust and a triangle of mouldy cheese , and had set to devouring the whole without ceremony , by way of consolation and breakfast
quite recently , at villette , when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the saint-martin canal without interrupting navigation or emptying the canal , a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal , water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel , which was beyond the power of the pumping engines ; it was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin , and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped up
one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory
thought on any subject whatever , outside of the restricted circle of his functions , would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue ; thought on the day which had just passed was a torture
all that is the ceremony of dying
how do you know that i have not been an assassin ?
those cherubs are devils
how does he manage to be here , the old gambler ?
poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of france
monsieur le comte as big as my arm , assassins of september
he was the predestined constructor of the french group , succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe
he has villainous teeth , because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers , and handsome eyes because he has wit
she knew that hand , that arm , the sleeve of that coat
hold , this is what they put on this passport : jean valjean , discharged convict , native of ' -- that is nothing to you -- has been nineteen years in the galleys : five years for house-breaking and burglary ; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions
in the first case , the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys , in the second , a convict rose above the law , and set his foot upon it
the candle was on the chimney-piece , and gave but very little light
one fixed idea possesses me , and sears my brain like fire
are the canons defending themselves ?
m leblanc did not interrupt him , but said to him when he paused : -i do not know what you mean to say
twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement , through the whole length of the street
the first time that javert beheld m madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town , he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master 's clothes
he abounded in pleasantries , which were more peculiar than witty , says benjamin constant
twice a year , on the first of january and on st george 's day , marius wrote duty letters to his father , which were dictated by his aunt , and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula ; this was all that m gillenormand tolerated ; and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread
he passed those same places once more with drooping head , voiceless , tearless , almost breathless
there you will find m bossuet
besides , since our despair has this peculiarity , that it envelops others as well as ourselves , it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to die
jean valjean remained inert beneath javert 's grasp , like a lion submitting to the claws of a lynx
rot not like an unlettered ass , _quasi asinus illitteratus_ , on the straw seats of the school
judges , clerks , gendarmes , a throng of cruelly curious heads , all these he had already beheld once , in days gone by , twenty-seven years before ; he had encountered those fatal things once more ; there they were ; they moved ; they existed ; it was no longer an effort of his memory , a mirage of his thought ; they were real gendarmes and real judges , a real crowd , and real men of flesh and blood : it was all over ; he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him , with all that there is formidable in reality
almost at the same instant with the children , another couple approached the great basin
the irregular , the unforeseen , the disordered opening of chaos , the possible slip over a precipice -- this was the work of the lower regions , of rebels , of the wicked , of wretches
then she prostrates herself ; a great black veil is thrown over her , and the office for the dead is sung
this man did not belong in the country-side
as for the six hundred thousand francs , you do not mention them to me , but i forestall your thought , they are a deposit
on the chimney-piece , under a glass globe , stood a woman 's head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers
revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the parisian character , generosity , devotion , stormy gayety , students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence , the national guard invincible , bivouacs of shopkeepers , fortresses of street urchins , contempt of death on the part of passers-by
continuation of the crown which was changed into a dry leaf
under the rue saint-denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii
mahiette made no reply
javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner
that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence
go on , go on !
two boon companions came forth
monseigneur , he said , returning to the provost , which am i to take ?
gringoire flew thither , hoping to escape , by the swiftness of his legs , from the three infirm spectres who had clutched him
thenardier was the first to break the silence
they are coming to seize me
the same day on which robert d ’ estouteville took the place of jacques de villiers in the provostship of paris , master jehan dauvet replaced messire helye de thorrettes in the first presidency of the court of parliament , jehan jouvenel des ursins supplanted pierre de morvilliers in the office of chancellor of france , regnault des dormans ousted pierre puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king ’ s household
he paused , smote the table with his fist , and added , as he ground his teeth : -oh !
why did achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances ?
is it indeed true ?
listen , master pierre gringoire
who certainly , added gervaise , have teeth long enough to eat little children
a little rosebush which she had , had dried up , forgotten , in one corner
he protected her , and she strengthened him
be so good as to take a seat , monsieur
to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence !
i see your cabriolet pass my window
i do not wand to ged a gold
she was conquered , palpitating in his arms , and in his power
the house of the petit-picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated
like the nuns , the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor
people stood aside respectfully
it 's all right , he resumed , casting a glance at the beggar-girl , as she coiled up under the shawl , she 's got a famous peel
she put them into the tiny shoes , took them out , admired them , marvelled at them , looked at the light through them , was curious to see them try to walk on her bed , and would gladly have passed her life on her knees , putting on and taking off the shoes from those feet , as though they had been those of an infant jesus
therefore , she did not know what name to give to what she now felt
it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer
night had fully come
the hearse was still advancing
you ask why i speak ?
i believe that it is true , and i feel that it is true
but one must do something for the good god 's sake
with the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm of mont-saint-jean , and of vivian 's and vandeleur 's brigades , which flanked the left wing , wellington had no cavalry left
he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated
these symptoms of a violent moral preoccupation , had acquired an especially high degree of intensity at the epoch when this story takes place
this could only be the head of a column ; and of what column ?
your name has reached me in a confused manner , it is true , and very badly pronounced , i must admit ; but that signifies nothing : clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman , the people
marius continued : you are also jondrette the workman , fabantou the comedian , genflot the poet , don alvares the spaniard , and mistress balizard
we have spoken of this singular place in detail , but with respect , in so far , at least , as detail and respect are compatible
this is instructive at the same time
and then , thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls
a little peasant girl , all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle , was offering flowers to the travellers
to open it , to scale the frame , to bestride it , was the work of a second only
cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory ; marius perceived cosette on an altar
something of that sort
the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower , and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time
nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age
perhaps she is there among them !
ambition was at that time , in the direct acceptation of the word , a race to the steeple
he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair
jean valjean , in the thick cloud of the combat , did not appear to see marius ; the truth is , that he never took his eyes from the latter
he never said to himself : what if i were to go to such a place ?
i know what you mean
montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance ; the fact is , that these four men , with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other , had prowled all night long about la force , great as was their peril , in the hope of seeing thenardier make his appearance on the top of some wall
nevertheless , with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously , messire robert d ’ estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of january , number , in a very surly and peevish mood
it was little gavroche on his way to the wars
be happy , be in heaven , be the angel of an angel , exist in the sun , be content therewith , and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth ; you have before you , sir , a wretched man
venerate the man , whoever he may be , who has this sign -- the starry eye
well , mother hucheloup , we are avenging you
utopias travel about underground , in the pipes
but he did not know it
are not chains which are endless above human strength ?
an honorable man is gilles lecornu , brother of master jehan lecornu , provost of the king ’ s house , son of master mahiet lecornu , first porter of the bois de vincennes , -- all bourgeois of paris , all married , from father to son
moreover , all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars , even the attic windows in the roof
then i like it better too
in the meantime , a cloud had risen ; it had begun to rain
said she , you have a mirror !
with clenched fists , with arms outspread at right angles , like a man crucified who has been un-nailed , and flung face down on the earth
no one must see me , the whole point lies there , father fauchelevent
i think people are flinging stones at me , i flee without knowing whither , everything whirls and whirls
the son , regretting the swans , turned his head back toward the basin until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him
poor survincent , the poacher , who had gone through the prison-cellar of the chatelet , said : it was the rhymes that kept me up
after leaving behind him the civic tournelle and the criminal tower , and skirted the great walls of the king ’ s garden , on that unpaved strand where the mud reached to his ankles , he reached the western point of the city , and considered for some time the islet of the passeur-aux-vaches , which has disappeared beneath the bronze horse of the pont neuf
what was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place !
and then she stared at him with a bewildered air
brevet , said the president , you have undergone an ignominious sentence , and you can not take an oath
the man seemed to have received an electric shock
what truth have you deduced , i will not say from medicine , which is too foolish a thing , but from astrology ?
that is precisely the idea of which i was in search
the spot was absolutely solitary
a tear swam in the eye of the bellringer , but did not fall
the insurgents , surprised but not terrified , had rallied
marius , dreamer as he was , was , as we have said , firm and energetic by nature
it is well , said jean valjean
this cavern knows no philosophers ; its dagger has never cut a pen
he was murdering , morally murdering , a wretched man

the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall , in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him
i followed him ; you know the rest
not to consider here anything except the christian architecture of europe , that younger sister of the great masonries of the orient , it appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three well-defined zones , which are superposed , the one upon the other : the romanesque zone , the gothic zone , the zone of the renaissance , which we would gladly call the greco-roman zone
is that what you want ?

on reflecting upon this , he fell into perplexity
she dipped her pen in the ink , and turning to marius : -do you want to see ?
during the king ’ s absence , several despatches had been placed on his table , and he broke the seals himself

the urchin 's profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and good sense
the bishop remained silent for a moment ; then he raised his grave eyes , and said gently to madame magloire : -and , in the first place , was that silver ours ?
one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole , like the rhone ; then , as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper , he smote the table with his fist , and shouted : -and with his goody-goody air !
no one could have told what was passing within him , not even himself
that done , he grasped le cabuc by the hair , as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked , and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear

m madeleine , who had taken up the docket again several moments before this , resumed with an air of perfect indifference : -and what reply did you receive ?

he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight , and in the other case for its pitiless foresight ; and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess , a default of work and an excess of punishment
here is her shoe , all that is left me of her
and you also , you pardon me !
gringoire began to eat eagerly

he took her by the hand , and they both went out

there was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman
he was still in the same posture , with his breast bent over the table , his head lying flat on his arms , surrounded by glasses , beer-jugs and bottles
he meditated of nothing else ; he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat , and that his new coat was growing old , that his shirts were wearing out , that his hat was wearing out , that his boots were giving out , and he said to himself : if i could but see her once again before i die !
he still held the same opinions
my heart is full
he is the son of one of those brigands of the loire , but children are innocent of their fathers ' crimes
that gallows is for me !
but this lasted only for a moment
he only thought of m gillenormand in an amiable light , but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father
the two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager
he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover , and succeeded , by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented , in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival , and that the man was deceiving her
exclaimed the captain , that ’ s not the way to depart
cambronne 's reply produces the effect of a violent break
he went on , and where will the advocate of the crown be tried ?
you split our head !
the first room , opening on the street , served him as dining-room , the second was his bedroom , and the third his oratory
oh , come now , cried the student , gazing in turn at his brother and the alembics on the furnace , everything is preposterous here , both ideas and bottles !
it was an overturned wagon ; his foot recognized pools of water , gullies , and paving-stones scattered and piled up
once , having confidence in a fine september sun , marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac , bossuet , and grantaire , hoping , what a dream !
cosette , my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little
let us make another trial , resumed the vagabond
is it a werewolf child ?
these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles
in the meantime , clopin trouillefou appeared to hold a momentary conference with the duke of egypt , and the emperor of galilee , who was completely drunk
certain success would attend the experiment of employing the city to manure the plain
then from the captain , his thought passed to the people , and there came to him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort
she became beautiful once more , in consequence of it
yes , for any one but jean valjean
the first comer is a wretch , femme -- woman -- rhymes with infame , -- infamous
life was no longer there , it was something else
and he added , deep in his own mind , i owe him a visit
go to the devil !
m mabeuf opened his bookcase , took a long look at all his books , one after another , as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice , then seized one hastily , put it in under his arm and went out
an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room
it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people , whose reasoning is hollow
i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend , a fruit-seller whom i know in the rue chemin-vert , who is deaf , and who has a little bed
write , clerk , said charmolue
the student watched his brother with surprise
the first , conscious that he was the more feeble , avoided the second ; but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious ; any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight , and all the menace that fear contains
i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette
these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the child 's mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart , and when they were all there , seated in a circle around a dying fire , sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green , with their severe profiles , their gray or white hair , their long gowns of another age , whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished , dropping , at rare intervals , words which were both majestic and severe , little marius stared at them with frightened eyes , in the conviction that he beheld not women , but patriarchs and magi , not real beings , but phantoms
it certainly was fantine 's signature ; thenardier recognized it
we shall be this evening in the rue de l'homme arme , no
that dazed me a bit
the old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter ; and henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics
in the winter i warmed myself in the sun , under the porch of the hôtel de sens , and i thought it very ridiculous that the fire on saint john ’ s day was reserved for the dog days
in the first place , i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is , that you have not uttered the faintest cry
these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individual anxieties
in what manner had enjolras subjugated him ?
a moment later he heard ma'am bougon take her departure , locking the door of the house behind her
it 's not the dying so much ; you die , for one must die , and that 's all right ; it 's the abomination of feeling those people touch you
nevertheless , he began to grow impatient with coppenole ’ s behavior , and suddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth , that the flemish giant recoiled , like a bull-dog before a cat
it is bonaparte 's fatal number
like dogs ; ah , this is abominable !
no violent remedy is necessary
the baker demands a settlement , and says , no money , no bread
quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat ; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell , breathed in this overwhelming breath , gazed by turns at the deep place , which swarmed with people , two hundred feet below him , and at that enormous , brazen tongue which came , second after second , to howl in his ear
nature had made her a lamb , religion had made her an angel
when doth it please you that i shall apprehend the little sorceress ?
you may , it seems to me , suppose that i have something which resembles a heart
as he proceeded , bruneseau drew , directed , and completed considerable works ; in number he lowered the arch of the ponceau , and , everywhere creating new lines , he pushed the sewer , in number , under the rue saint-denis as far as the fountain of the innocents ; in number , under the rue froidmanteau and under the salpetriere ; in number under the rue neuve-des-petits-peres , under the rue du mail , under the rue de l'echarpe , under the place royale ; in number , under the rue de la paix , and under the chaussee d'antin
it appears that gringoire had taken advantage of the moment of debarcation to slip away with the goat into the block of houses of the rue grenier-sur-l ’ eau
his face was the same color as his trousers
it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes
he conformed to the bourgeois 's directions , and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people , and where groups , intermingled with lawyers in their gowns , were whispering together here and there
one day , the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence : to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned ?
they lived nameless , designated only by numbers , and converted , after a manner , into ciphers themselves , with downcast eyes , with lowered voices , with shorn heads , beneath the cudgel and in disgrace
reduced to itself , abandoned by the other arts , because human thought is abandoning it , it summons bunglers in place of artists
human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance , a third lower floor
there are thoughts which play us the same trick ; they nestle away in a corner of our brain ; that is the end of them ; they are lost ; it is impossible to lay the memory on them
their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite
fex urbis , exclaims cicero ; mob , adds burke , indignantly ; rabble , multitude , populace
you shall see how i love you also
brother what father of the church is it , who says that the errors of heretics have always had for their lurking place the thickets of aristotle ’ s metaphysics ?
nothing easier , replied the host
as for us , all our glorification goes to the english soldier , to the english army , to the english people

the bailiff de ferrette , with his short breeches and his thin legs , sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de talleyrand

jehan , you have no soul
hence his possession was in good faith
more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said : where the devil are my two children ?
their prayer audaciously offers discussion
several hours before the barricade was attacked , he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon , with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice
he had finally grown bold , and approached the bench
the one who is on the point of departure is a saint
it is necessary , for the sake of the forward march of the human race , that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights
do you know who little father lenoir is ?
souls which blossomed out yesterday , and are faded to-day , like those flowers let fall in the streets , which are soiled with every sort of mire , while waiting for some wheel to crush them
he goes to the spectacles which god furnishes gratis ; he gazes at the sky , space , the stars , flowers , children , the humanity among which he is suffering , the creation amid which he beams
it was a dead body which remained hanging there , bent double , its loins broken , its skull empty
there was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church
you hear the bell
her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from god , -- laughter
she alone could accuse her lover , and destroy him by her confession
we live in times of terrible confusion
the cure of this big church ?
she is the first awake , the last asleep
it makes use of death , a serious matter
a tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room , deposited his thirty sous and selected , according to the part which he wished to play , the costume which suited him , and on descending the stairs once more , the knave was a somebody
that very evening , the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure , and some time afterwards m myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of d -- -what truth was there , after all , in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m myriel 's life ?
her glance fell upon the water which stood before her ; such was the fright which the thenardier inspired in her , that she dared not flee without that bucket of water : she seized the handle with both hands ; she could hardly lift the pail
marius disengaged his head from his grandfather 's arms , and said gently : but , father , now that i am quite well , it seems to me that i might see her
learn this in addition ; the wineshops of the ragpickers are called bibines ; the most celebrated are the saucepan and the slaughter-house
the district-attorney 's persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one , of the public , of the court , and of the jury
this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him , and , taking it all in all , he accepted it ; but he was none the less bewildered
some of the scoffed-at did , nevertheless , penetrate thither on sufferance
these be-ribboned and be-flowered tumbrils of mire are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public
but he was too late
they gave the petticoat to eponine
i heard the eight singers of the king of sicily intone the first verse of seven o ’ clock mass in the sainte-chapelle
they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal
the enigma was more impenetrable than ever
it had rained the night before , and even a little in the morning
the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched
it sometimes happened that kind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him
in others , any one entered who wished , and the room was so full that they were forced to stand
besides , what is danger in comparison with the right ?
marius gazed intently at him : i know your extraordinary secret , just as i knew jean valjean 's name , just as i know your name
he no longer knew where he was , what he thought , or whether he were dreaming
at length the archdeacon , giving quasimodo ’ s powerful shoulder a rough shake , made him a sign to rise and follow him
the barricade had been put in order , the tap-room disencumbered , the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance , the dressing of the wounded completed , the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up , bullets run , cartridges manufactured , lint scraped , the fallen weapons re-distributed , the interior of the redoubt cleaned , the rubbish swept up , corpses removed
there were corpses lying prone there , and phantoms standing erect
marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle
besides brevet , there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean ; they are cochepaille and chenildieu , and are sentenced for life
as soon as cujas had taken his departure , gamacho entered
they are all alike !
jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering ; he emerged impassive
what was i thinking of to thrust myself into that stone gimlet which pierces the sky ; all for the sake of eating bearded cheese , and looking at the bell-towers of paris through a hole in the wall !
they attached themselves , without intermediate shades , to incorruptible right and absolute duty
this would enjoin us from consigning something sublime to history
a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade
this last member of his phrase remained unuttered
this was the moment when eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard
you , your shade , the image of the luminous apparition which had one day crossed the space before me
he was a man of whom his superiors said , he tries to make himself of use
gringoire fell backwards , quite thunderstruck with joy
how do i know ? -- a mere nothing , a horse , a remark !
whether monsieur your father comes in that category , i do not know !
enjolras did not appear to be listening , but had any one been near him , that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice : patria
was he , in short , the man whom thenardier thought that he recognized ?
the bride 's garter is cousin to the girdle of venus
the besieged man , alas !
he shouted : long live the republic !
in closing , it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of quasimodo
i am going to suppress the candelabra
i hastened to thee , thou wert no longer there
gringoire was on the point of taking the bag in his hand
simplice of sicily , as we know , is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse -- a lie which would have saved her
from that moment forth , all was over ; the ogre of corsica , -- the usurper , -- the tyrant , -- the monster who was the lover of his own sisters , -- the actor who took lessons of talma , -- the poisoner of jaffa , -- the tiger , -- buonaparte , -- all this vanished , and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone , at an inaccessible height , the pale marble phantom of caesar
so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs , monsieur pontmercy
what say you , messieurs les bourgeois ?
these squares were no longer battalions , they were craters ; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry , they were a tempest
replied the fat magistrate , half aroused , it ’ s tolerably jolly , that ’ s a fact
what will become of her , poor creature ?
only , he felt that he could not do otherwise , now that he used thou to cosette , than say you to eponine
thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall , in order to preserve it from the rats , as he said
let us inflict punishment , since we are history : old blucher disgraced himself
jean valjean tore up his shirt , bandaged the young man 's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood ; then bending over marius , who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing , in that half light , he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred
philosophy should be an energy ; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man
it was falling into ruins ; every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it
hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house
favourite was the first to break the silence
nevertheless , the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the modern palace , bristling with carved eaves , covered with sheets of lead , where coiled a thousand fantastic arabesques of sparkling incrustations of gilded bronze , that roof , so curiously damascened , darted upwards gracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice ; whose huge and ancient towers , rounded by age like casks , sinking together with old age , and rending themselves from top to bottom , resembled great bellies unbuttoned
i must inform you that i have just seen the king , louis xi , and that i have caught this oath from him , -- _pasque-dieu_ !
are you set on the death of that spy ?
terrible , toad-like tongue which goes and comes , leaps , crawls , slobbers , and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night , of hunger , of vice , of falsehood , of injustice , of nudity , of suffocation , and of winter , the high noonday of the miserable
villager , retorted the man , i ought not be a grave-digger
then he turned to cosette
this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods
one would have said that they were two criminals
marius ' emotion was profound
the waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him
if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life , it is probable that we should behold the forms of night , the winged unknowns , the blue passers of the invisible , bend down , a throng of sombre heads , around the luminous house , satisfied , showering benedictions , pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed , sweetly terrified , and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
in the meanwhile , she wept in torrents , in silence , in the dark , like a rain at night
human actions are taken by two handles
have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand , if you can
they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order
a redoubtable method , and one which , united with genius , rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years
virtue , granted , but madness also
he exclaimed : it is immoral that a mattress should have so much power
well , said she , it 's the lark !
he had been a terrible man
but let us leave the soldier , especially the contemporary soldier , out of the question
he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette
no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play ; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting , the president that he was there to preside , the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend
so saying , he handed the stranger the three bank-bills
he is resisting , fluttering his tiny wings , and still making an effort to fly , but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air
but i still owe the thenardiers over a hundred francs ; do you know that , monsieur inspector ?
she ventured to ask : -is it true , madame ?
dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march
tumultuous and stagnant gulf
madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest : -we say that this house is not safe at all ; that if monseigneur will permit , i will go and tell paulin musebois , the locksmith , to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors ; we have them , and it is only the work of a moment ; for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer-by ; and i say that we need bolts , monseigneur , if only for this night ; moreover , monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in ' ; and besides , even in the middle of the night , o mon dieu !
he felt that icy breath close to him , on his heels
in the brotherhood of gamins voltaire is not known , but papavoine is
what was she doing ?
these men did not astonish each other
he reflected that had he not given his five francs to the jondrette girl in the morning , he would have followed m leblanc 's fiacre , and consequently have remained ignorant of everything , and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the jondrettes and that m leblanc would have been lost , and his daughter with him , no doubt
but his whole nature revolted ; his aged paternity would not consent to this
no one would have dared to mention them ; no one would have dared to recall them
and , with an imperious motion , the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed , and brought him to his knees in the mire
they had wit ; they had silence ; their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance ; they should have succeeded
what did he think of this dogma , or of that mystery ?
he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her , he owed her his happiness , and yet , it was embarrassing to him to meet her
eponine and azelma had passed hours in contemplating it , and cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it , on the sly , it is true
hartwell 's pine table took its place in front of the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of louis xiv
it is a pity
a man for nothing !
jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction
nevertheless , it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them
the profile had a rose in its mouth
at the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride , he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots , and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness
properly speaking , he did not enter
he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago , when i was adjutant-guard of convicts at toulon
that face had clung to his mind
it will be a lesson to the bonapartists !
in populous cities , especially in capitals , there existed no single , central , regulating power
he has just committed a fresh theft ; it is a case of a second offence ; condemn him for the fresh deed ; later on he will be judged for the old crime
do you know , young girl , what i saw thenceforth between my book and me ?
captain , pursued the man , to-morrow , the day after to-morrow , a month hence , ten years hence , you will find me ready to cut your throat ; but go first to your rendezvous
the barber in his shop , which was warmed by a good stove , was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy , that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets , but whose mind was evidently unsheathed
the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time
in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion ; and it irritated him to have that within him
cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor , on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse ; and sometimes , when the day had been a good one , and they had assisted many in distress , and cheered and warmed many little children , cosette was rather merry in the evening
but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish , which one need but skirt ?
consider that i pray you on my knees , as one prays to jesus christ !
a full hour passed in the most profound silence
it 's true that i became bankrupt , that i am in hiding , that i have no bread , that i have not a single sou , that i am a villain !
moreover , he was a sad , grave , serious child , who studied ardently , and learned quickly ; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour , mixed but little in the bacchanals of the rue du fouarre , did not know what it was to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_ , and had cut no figure in that revolt of number , which the annalists register gravely , under the title of the sixth trouble of the university
jean prouvaire was in love ; he cultivated a pot of flowers , played on the flute , made verses , loved the people , pitied woman , wept over the child , confounded god and the future in the same confidence , and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head , that of andre chenier
the one who is in the shadows
such was the paris which the ravens , who lived in number , beheld from the summits of the towers of notre-dame
_nudus vinctus , centum pondo , es quando pendes per pedes_
the man , who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself , observed the child with peculiar attention
you will not take her from me , i am sure
the austere and glacial envelope of claude frollo , that cold surface of steep and inaccessible virtue , had always deceived jehan
what did cosette 's soul contain ?
oh , this is hell !
for the space of nearly two years we have made you happywe bear you no grudge for that
if one opened it , one found one 's self in a little chamber about six feet square , tiled , well-scrubbed , clean , cold , and hung with nankin paper with green flowers , at fifteen sous the roll

henceforth , it is apt at all roles , it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter , covered with verdigris by the forger , blacked by the soot of the incendiary ; and the murderer applies its rouge
the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to complain of their lot

he had made up his mind about the tumult , and was determined to proceed to the end , not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public
said he , now we are safe , all four of us
it was a dog scanning a thief
he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
the furnace was being heated
why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit-picpus ?
meanwhile , jehan was shouting in a hoarse voice :
she must be a big girl now ; she is seven years old ; she is quite a young lady ; i call her cosette , but her name is really euphrasie
the symbol is not the number
cosette was intoxicated , delighted , frightened , in heaven
i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop
the man bowed lower at that harsh voice
it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand , all cracked with chilblains , and kissed it
it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him , and he wished , before entering joyously into the future , to obtain a quittance from the past
you shall see what fun we will have
methusalem is a street arab beside cupid
you follow me , do you not ?
these young men formed a sort of family , through the bond of friendship
and turning to madame hucheloup , he added : -woman ancient and consecrated by use , draw near that i may contemplate thee !
we have so many expenses
by dint of toil , perseverance , courage , and will , he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year
no , said the gypsy
murmured marius , how beautiful you are !
my dear , continued fleur-de-lys , with decided sharpness , you will get yourself taken up by the sumptuary police for your gilded girdle
the charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled
farewell to mystery , myth , law
the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of number was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness , and which contains a little shame ; it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams ; it was the halt
the spiral staircase , hewn asunder with the axe , lay in the middle of the tap-room , a few wounded men were just breathing their last , every one who was not killed was on the first floor , and from there , through the hole in the ceiling , which had formed the entrance of the stairs , a terrific fire burst forth
in one of these moments he suddenly beheld the long window on the balcony , whose stone balustrade projected above his head , open mysteriously
perhaps it was tuesday
the gypsy was not insensible to these pin-pricks
what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards thenardier , was the idea of the distress into which he knew that thenardier had fallen , and which had engulfed the latter

as she performed this service , she was conversing with mademoiselle baptistine
then paquette la chantefleurie burst into hyena-like laughter
you would have to buy it to begin with , because no one knows you
now , at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal , the nine parts of self-esteem in gringoire , swollen and expanded by the breath of popular admiration , were in a state of prodigious augmentation , beneath which disappeared , as though stifled , that imperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets ; a precious ingredient , by the way , a ballast of reality and humanity , without which they would not touch the earth
they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns , and with kicks , shouting , calling , entreating , wringing their hands
fantine did not seem to hear it
we have just seen the head of the procession pass , joly and i
she cried , with an appalling laugh ; tis the egyptian who is calling me !
i think i actually did meet monsieur personally , several years ago , at the house of madame la princesse bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his lordship the vicomte dambray , peer of france
jean had no work
what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor
the doctor examined marius , and after having found that his pulse was still beating , that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast , and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils , he had him placed flat on the bed , without a pillow , with his head on the same level as his body , and even a trifle lower , and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration
and then a struggle arose as to who should remain , and who should find reasons for the others not remaining
at the moment when the cart moved off , he admitted that he had felt , a moment previously , a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding
moreover , he had in the audience , a pitiless censor of his deeds and gestures , in the person of our friend jehan frollo du moulin , that little student of yesterday , that stroller , whom one was sure of encountering all over paris , anywhere except before the rostrums of the professors
so the monk 's widow was good for something
it was now the mother 's turn to start up and exclaim : -just see there !
the roll was called
on that same night , then , when little gavroche picked up the two lost children , brujon and guelemer , who knew that babet , who had escaped that morning , was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse , rose softly , and with the nail which brujon had found , began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood
what do i owe you , madame , he added
my friends , there is a morrow ; you will not be here to-morrow , but your families will ; and what sufferings !
the landlady 's red and violent face brightened up hideously
was it you who killed the artillery sergeant ?
the woman remained motionless
to see her once again ; he still aspired to this , but he no longer expected it
a glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler 's wagon with a fluted wicker hood , harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted , hidden , as it were , behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to nivelles , at the angle of the road from mont-saint-jean to braine l'alleud ; and in the wagon , a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages
like it , it is the divine spark ; like it , it is incorruptible , indivisible , imperishable
it was there , that , about number , was committed that mysterious assassination , called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier , whose authors justice was never able to discover ; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated , a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled
he felt , even in the very roots of his hair , the immense reawakening of egotism , and the _i_ in this man 's abyss howled
any one who was hungry could present himself there , and was sure of finding employment and bread

if a flood comes , the mountains will have long disappeared beneath the waves , while the birds will still be flying about ; and if a single ark floats on the surface of the cataclysm , they will alight upon it , will float with it , will be present with it at the ebbing of the waters ; and the new world which emerges from this chaos will behold , on its awakening , the thought of the world which has been submerged soaring above it , winged and living
he shut his eyes , and when he opened them again , he thought they were a circle of pale visages gazing at him
at the same time the strange army executed several evolutions , as though it were taking up its post around the church
he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk
a man has a hemlet on his head , a sword in his hand , and golden spurs on his heels
at that moment the crowd broke into applause : old convict-sergeants among them wept , and women embraced each other on the quay , and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage , pardon for that man !
but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss
what is the matter ?
he was transparent but impenetrable
meanwhile , the archdeacon was panting
the man ceased speaking , and remained standing
room for a brief parenthesis
hardly the sound of a breath was audible
did i exist before my birth ?
you shall see , gentlemen , that i , in my turn , can say : it is impossible
claude , in the state of hallucination in which he found himself , believed that he saw , that he saw with his actual eyes , the bell tower of hell ; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the terrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior furnace ; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many shrieks , so many death groans
gringoire scratched his ear , with a very serious air
we are going to bring him back , to take him with us , whether he is willing or not , he shall never leave us again
but you , mahiette -- why do you run so at the mere sight of them ?
and again she offered him her brow

here , i have burned my coat
each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from gringoire ’ s loins , and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook , began to be established in rough fashion
for a moment he thought himself lost
he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom , painted by jordaens , executed with great dashes of the brush , with millions of details , in a confused and hap-hazard manner
marius directed his steps towards that red light
courage was necessary ; she possessed it , and held herself firm
for his part , he thought the barricade ripe , and as that which is ripe ought to fall , he made the attempt
javert interrupted him : -you will say that i might have handed in my resignation , but that does not suffice
a very white and very pure light brought out vividly to the eye all the outlines that its thousands of houses present to the east

and with health , there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his grandfather
are you sure , persisted claude , with his penetrating glance , that it is only a word and not a name ?
it weighs upon the woman , that is to say , upon grace , weakness , beauty , maternity

jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day ; he had merely had the glass door leading to cosette 's dressing-room replaced by a solid door

to behold thee going and coming from dawn in thy chemise , gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror !
the whole barricade gave vent to a cry ; but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy ; for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth ; gavroche had fallen only to rise again ; he remained in a sitting posture , a long thread of blood streaked his face , he raised both arms in the air , glanced in the direction whence the shot had come , and began to sing : je suis tombe par terre , i have fallen to the earth , c'est la faute a voltaire ; 't is the fault of voltaire ; le nez dans le ruisseau , with my nose in the gutter , c'est la faute a
he was a man of lofty stature , half peasant , half artisan

as long as there was any danger , m gillenormand , seated in despair at his grandson 's pillow , was , like marius , neither alive nor dead
it was an odd moment when cosette 's rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll
at first sight , this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution ; the father , when he hired the chamber , had stated that his name was jondrette
what is this dead-room ?

this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me , and who is , no doubt , blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers ; those peoples are rascals ; and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures ; and i was going off to denounce myself ; and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly !

the deaf man gazed at her
a filousophe [ philosophe ] , a scientific thief
he held both these arms with one hand , and groped along the wall with the other
thenardier exclaimed : -are you mad !

father fauchelevent rattled in the throat , and shrieked : -i am strangling !

how true it is that the beloved being becomes god
a disagreeable moment , a toll-gate , the passage of little to nothingness

then the bourgeois shouts : long live the people !
pay attention to what i am saying to you , swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know !

fires , around which swarmed strange groups , blazed here and there
there were moments when he looked as if not daring to touch her , even with his breath
thirdly : the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance , is good , but , on important occasions , it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other , so that , in case one agent should , for any cause , grow weak in his service , the other may supervise him and take his place
he did not know what had become of his wife and children
she remembered that she had been condemned to death for murder committed on the person of phoebus de châteaupers
who gave me such a father as that ?
if i continued to be monsieur fauchelevent , that would arrange everything
this man , this rash individual , was the man with the bald brow , who , a moment earlier , standing with the gypsy ’ s group had chilled the poor girl with his words of menace and of hatred
her glory consisted in her caps , which were always white
all at once the gypsy started , a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes , she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the place with anguish , exclaiming : phoebus !
the bars held firm
she was born at m sur m of what parents ?
his nature was thus constituted

it is only such cities that become capitals
in the meantime , the recluse had not uttered another word since tristan had seen her daughter and all hope was lost

he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract
alexander called him my sleeplessness
the anterior portion of the ball was occupied by the crowd ; on the right and left were magistrates and tables ; at the end , upon a platform , a number of judges , whose rear rank sank into the shadows , sinister and motionless faces

this person carried a package -- something square , like a large box or a small trunk
there is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye , and become roses all at once

marius resumed : -now that i think of it , you ought to know my address : something might happen , one never knows ; i live with that friend named courfeyrac , rue de la verrerie , no

this fanaticism was neither a dogma , nor an idea , nor an art , nor a science ; it was a man : enjolras
so they emancipate themselves , break the yoke of the architect , and take themselves off , each one in its own direction
he did , indeed , catch an inkling of illegitimacy , the history of fantine had always seemed to him equivocal ; but what was the use of talking about that ?
in fact , he had , for some time past , been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on cosette 's sweet face
he went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety , and because , as he loved the faces of men , but hated their noise , he found them assembled and silent only in church
the exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack

the idea of living in a mountainous country , and not even having lights in the streets at night !
the past is very strong , it is true , at the present moment
they ate each other somewhat , it is true , which is the misery of evil mixed with good ; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach

at the sight of this line of cuirassed backs , undulating as they rose through the gloom , one would have pronounced it a serpent with steel scales , which was raising itself erect in front of the church
he merely noticed that she had grown sad , and he grew gloomy
it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday , our breakfast of yesterday , our dinner of to-day , and all that at once , and this morning
and she has so sweet and good an air !
the successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we renounce all attempts at depicting
she patched her bodice , which was old and worn out , with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement
we must admit that she was not much grieved by this voluntary absence on the part of the poor hunchback
he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago
passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom

there appears , in the humid mist , the rat which seems the product to which paris has given birth
his heart contracted within him
jean valjean felt completely reassured
the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street ; it afforded shelter from the bullets , the grape-shot , and all eyes , and a few square feet of space
m agier laid down the law in them
he was in sympathy with but two things in this world : notre-dame and claude frollo
enjolras brought the square coffer , and courfeyrac opened it
and what makes you think that he will come ?

at the prefecture of police in paris
when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there
in number , five years after his arrival in m sur m , the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling , the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous , that the king again appointed him mayor of the town
this road , through which cosette had passed , excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary

death of the devil !

every time that that young viper passes in front of my cell , she sets my blood in a ferment

a moment later , squarely planted in the very middle of the street , astride of the gutter , the piece was ready for action
after so doing | | | | || you will tear it up
jean valjean set out on a run , in the direction which he had first taken
this man , whose costume was concealed by the crowd which surrounded him , did not appear to be more than five and thirty years of age ; nevertheless , he was bald ; he had merely a few tufts of thin , gray hair on his temples ; his broad , high forehead had begun to be furrowed with wrinkles , but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary youthfulness , an ardent life , a profound passion
he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man
the sun is on the point of setting
why , i am covering my melons , of course !
he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother
the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger , the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become re-absorbed , and consequently , to kill the sick man , under certain atmospheric conditions ; at every change of weather , at the slightest storm , the physician was uneasy

the difference between the visible and the palpable , between the fluid and the solid in the same substance , between water and ice , nothing more
at half-past three o'clock in the morning , he lost one illusion ; officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any movement
therapontigonus miles could walk arm in arm with vadeboncoeur the grenadier , damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among bric-a-brac merchants , vincennes could grasp socrates in its fist as just as agora could imprison diderot , grimod de la reyniere discovered larded roast beef , as curtillus invented roast hedgehog , we see the trapeze which figures in plautus reappear under the vault of the arc of l'etoile , the sword-eater of poecilus encountered by apuleius is a sword-swallower on the pontneuf , the nephew of rameau and curculio the parasite make a pair , ergasilus could get himself presented to cambaceres by d'aigrefeuille ; the four dandies of rome : alcesimarchus , phoedromus , diabolus , and argyrippus , descend from courtille in labatut 's posting-chaise ; aulus gellius would halt no longer in front of congrio than would charles nodier in front of punchinello ; marto is not a tigress , but pardalisca was not a dragon ; pantolabus the wag jeers in the cafe anglais at nomentanus the fast liver , hermogenus is a tenor in the champs-elysees , and round him , thracius the beggar , clad like bobeche , takes up a collection ; the bore who stops you by the button of your coat in the tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two thousand years thesprion 's apostrophe : quis properantem me prehendit pallio ?
the bal mabile is not the polymnia dance of the janiculum , but the dealer in ladies ' wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes , exactly as the procuress staphyla lay in wait for the virgin planesium

he had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron
she made the movement of a bird , which thrusts its head out of its nest , glanced first at her husband , then at jean valjean , and cried to them with a smile , so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose : i will wager that you are talking politics
the sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood
no one paid any attention to him
rome said : you shall not take clusium
hence phoebus ’ s mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress esmeralda , or similar , as he called her , concerning the blow from the dagger of the bohemian or of the surly monk ( it mattered little which to him ) , and as to the issue of the trial
they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets ; the blows of their gun-stocks against the stones ; javert 's appeals to the police spies whom he had posted , and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished
rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla
if the man had not his card , he mentioned his name , the porter , who was sometimes in bed and asleep , rose , came out and identified the man , and opened the gate with his key ; the grave-digger stepped out , but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs
he drew his sword , then stammering , for anger as well as fear makes a man tremble : here !
the flash passed , the night closed in again ; and where was he ?
at the end of another minute , the carriage-load of maskers had their hands full , the multitude set to yelling , which is the crowd 's caress to masquerades ; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades , and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace
this signature is fairly well imitated , he growled between his teeth ; however , let it go !
this sound , faint at first , then precise , then heavy and sonorous , approached slowly , without halt , without intermission , with a tranquil and terrible continuity
it was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem , whose numerous branches , bristling and leafless and as fine as threads , were covered with a million tiny white rosettes ; this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowersthere was always an admiring crowd about it

its explosions , its days , its masterpieces , its prodigies , its epics , go forth to the bounds of the universe , and so also do its cock-and-bull stories
stupefied , he turned round
as he spoke all tongues , he entered into all hearts
he dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city , far from any hamlet , far from any road , in some hidden turn of a very wild valley , no one knew exactly where
it 's a joke that they are playing on you , is not it
you are to explain many things to me
romulus carried off the sabines ; william carried off the saxon women ; caesar carried off the roman women
the bishop almost regretted having come , and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken
there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town to-night
sometimes he rides a hideous horse
he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles ; that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope , he would arrive , in less than a quarter of an hour , at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the pont-neuf , that is to say , he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris
he replied in so low a tone that cosette hardly heard him : -i did not understand what you said
happy is he who , when the hour strikes , takes a heroic resolve , and abdicates like sylla or origenes

and all at once , a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time , was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords , through the rue bassompierre and the boulevard bourdon , sweeping all before them
he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred

they waited for it with a smile
at genappe , an effort was made to wheel about , to present a battle front , to draw up in line
all the most august , the most sublime , the most charming of humanity , and perhaps outside of humanity , have made puns
he must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries , bent over , weighed down , in the dark , in the cess-pool , -- more than a league and a half , sir , with a corpse upon his back !
the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons , but in the nations
but what the drama would gain thereby , truth would lose
some seem to be still smoking
marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking
what do you want with me ?
he allots the imposts , taxes each person conscientiously , judges quarrels for nothing , divides inheritances without charge , pronounces sentences gratuitously ; and he is obeyed , because he is a just man among simple men
all at once , the drum beat the charge
i ’ m above that ; i kill
on the first floor , hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase
the secret is the thing above all others
i do not know what was the matter with him to-day
he has not a sou to pay for a supper
a frenzied whirl enveloped them
growled thenardier , pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand

it is necessary that society should look at these things , because it is itself which creates them
the first has the whole heavens in his eyes ; the last , enigmatical though he may be , has still , beneath his eyelids , the pale beam of the infinite
he cast a glance towards the roof from time to time ; the gypsy did not stir any more than himself
she was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark
the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him ; he was occupied only in finding for himself , and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve

about seven o'clock in the morning , he had just risen and breakfasted , and was trying to settle down to work , when there came a soft knock at his door
on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the claws of the thenardiers , he returned to paris
the four young women looked at each other
it was customary for bishops in former days
worn out with fatigue , and no longer entertaining any hope , he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office
he was seen to run out along the yard : on arriving at the point , he fastened the rope which he had brought to it , and allowed the other end to hang down , then he began to descend the rope , hand over hand , and then , -- and the anguish was indescribable , -- instead of one man suspended over the gulf , there were two
later on , this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten , and all this grace ends , with the bourgeois , on two legs , and with the tomcat , on four paws

you are in a sorry case , my good fellow !
several moments after passing the bell chamber , he came upon a little landing-place , built in a lateral niche , and under the vault of a low , pointed door , whose enormous lock and strong iron bars he was enabled to see through a loophole pierced in the opposite circular wall of the staircase
this seemed profane , and the prioress forbade it
the king could not refrain from saying : good !
marius , more intent on the outside than on the interior , had not , up to that time , taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the tap-room
one evening , after he had followed them to their dwelling , and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate , he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter : -is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor , who has just come in ?
without her knowing why herself , and without his having any cause to accuse her of it , her soul had become so wholly her husband 's that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius ' mind became overcast in hers
he had been a mousquetaire , and then , he was said to be very coquettish , that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head , and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire , and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world
for paris is a total
yes , remarked gervaise , but the gypsies ?
no one in the garden ; no one in the house
this gloom pleased him ; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley , in order there to meditate at his ease , and in order that the philosopher might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet
it will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army ; he was in the habit of relating with exuberance , how , being a sergeant in the numberth or the numberth light something or other , at waterloo , he had alone , and in the presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars , covered with his body and saved from death , in the midst of the grape-shot , a general , who had been dangerously wounded
the lovers saw each other every day
that is what it is like
when , at the conclusion of all the ceremonies , after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses , after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy , after having exchanged their rings , after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer , they arrived , hand in hand , admired and envied by all , marius in black , she in white , preceded by the suisse , with the epaulets of a colonel , tapping the pavement with his halberd , between two rows of astonished spectators , at the portals of the church , both leaves of which were thrown wide open , ready to enter their carriage again , and all being finished , cosette still could not believe that it was real

after a silence , the priest resumed , --
madame magloire was , in fact , just putting the last touches to the table
it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius , and asked him : what is your grandson doing ?
then , there will be nothing more like the history of old , we shall no longer , as to-day , have to fear a conquest , an invasion , a usurpation , a rivalry of nations , arms in hand , an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings , on a birth in hereditary tyrannies , a partition of peoples by a congress , a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty , a combat of two religions meeting face to face , like two bucks in the dark , on the bridge of the infinite ; we shall no longer have to fear famine , farming out , prostitution arising from distress , misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword , and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events

he did not know , he who wore his heart on his sleeve , he who observed only the good old law of nature in the world , he who allowed his passions to follow their inclinations , and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry , so freely did he let it off each day by fresh drains , -- he did not know with what fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress is denied to it , how it accumulates , how it swells , how it overflows , how it hollows out the heart ; how it breaks in inward sobs , and dull convulsions , until it has rent its dikes and burst its bed
what 's that you are gabbling about there ?
do you hear me ?
but guillaume rym , with his polished smile , approached the usher
i was going to tell you some news
without uttering a cry , she raised herself erect with a terrible expression ; then she flung herself upon the hand of the executioner , like a beast on its prey , and bit it

he may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary ; that is to say , a participant in his own person in that revolution , that he should have lent a hand to it , that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein , that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it

i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair ; that one must be on one 's guard ; that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris ( there the imagination of the police , that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable ) ; that a battery had been established in the rue aubry le boucher ; that lobau and bugeaud were putting their heads together , and that , at midnight , or at daybreak at latest , four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising , the first coming from the bastille , the second from the porte saint-martin , the third from the greve , the fourth from the halles ; that perhaps , also , the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ-de-mars ; that no one knew what would happen , but that this time , it certainly was serious

some traces of this geometrical plan still exist to-day
silent tears , terrible tears
jean valjean stammered : it was i who told basque to remove them
an irresistible magnet seemed to hold her

while the two women were whispering together , with their backs turned to fantine 's bed , the sister interrogating , the servant conjecturing , fantine , with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies , which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death , had raised herself to her knees in bed , with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster , and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains , and was listening

no , the persons have moved away
it is understood , of course , that the rue neuve-sainte-genevieve is an old street , and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years

there , you deaf villain , i ’ m your debtor
and being convinced himself , he was persuasive
it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street
and then , she had so often been told that she was homely ; jean valjean alone said gently : no indeed !

why did you not kill the man ?
at the hôtel-de-ville , i tell you !
i see plainly that you do not love me !
as he opened his mouth , doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired , the man rested both hands on his staff , directed his gaze at the old man and the two women , and without waiting for the bishop to speak , he said , in a loud voice : -see here

when you have ascended the rue saint-jacques , left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance , you reach the rue de la sante , then the glaciere , and , a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins , you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris , where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down

this hosier was an equal , who had just held his own before monsieur the cardinal
but if one remained near him for a few hours , and beheld him in the least degree pensive , the fine man became gradually transfigured , and took on some imposing quality , i know not what ; his broad and serious brow , rendered august by his white locks , became august also by virtue of meditation ; majesty radiated from his goodness , though his goodness ceased not to be radiant ; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings , without ceasing to smile
fantine heard the gossips say , as they looked at her child : who takes those children seriously !
a big voice , a good fellow
she had just dazzled herself

at intervals , as he combated his lassitude , he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind
it is certain that gringoire was enduring cruel perplexity
legend says they were not
but to-day , you see , i cried because it hurt me
it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne , and the mitre in the name of the attar ; it is to ill-treat the thing which one is dragging , it is to kick over the traces ; it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics ; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry ; it is to insult through excess of respect ; it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish , that the king is not sufficiently royal , and that the night has too much light ; it is to be discontented with alabaster , with snow , with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness ; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy ; it is to be so strongly for , as to be against
it bears the date of july number , number
upon the furnace were accumulated in disorder , all sorts of vases , earthenware bottles , glass retorts , and mattresses of charcoal
a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers
thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and says : phew !
cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen
he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform : the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion
these words touched m gillenormand ; uttered a little sooner , they would have rendered him tender , but they came too late
do come to my assistance : is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star ?
the cart was conquered , the drunken man was taken prisoner
in a moment they constituted a word , which the goat seemed to have been trained to write , so little hesitation did it show in forming it , and bérangère suddenly exclaimed , clasping her hands in admiration , --
does he think i can make it ?
he was no further advanced than at the beginning
one day , he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs : the father must give them some education
here , replied a black gown whom she had not before noticed

the fact is , that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet
what matters it , after all ?
m gillenormand , clutched by the throat by his own phrase , could not proceed
la vesle , replied mahiette , with a melancholy smile , is the river
madame thenardier was vicious with cosette
he had discovered , by dint of industry , or , at least , by dint of induction , he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer
she made haste to dress herself
does any body want me here ?
they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that
there was at toulon a school for the convicts , kept by the ignorantin friars , where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them
it was rapid but majestic
then , addressing the soldiers : -say , you fellows , did you see how i spit in his face ?

this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will ; it is a box
one day when blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the rue guerin-boisseau , he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up , which displayed her legs
moreover , -- and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur , -- she had grown used , without being herself aware of it , to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny

what a good night to leg it !
a brave little bird , probably a lover , was carolling in a distractedmanner in a large tree
the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels , the fellies , the hub , the axle , and the shaft , a layer of mud , a hideous yellowish daubing hue , tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals
the band of thieves applauded clopin ’ s words , and arranged themselves in a circle round the gibbet , with a laugh so pitiless that gringoire perceived that he amused them too much not to have everything to fear from them

his mother is dead
he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel
the errand-boy next door has a little pointed beard , i have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm ; to-day i saw him pass , and he had a gun on his arm
in order to provide more arms , one man took the gun , the other the bayonet
the old woman was in the chamber , putting things in order

marius held his peace ; she remained silent for a moment , then exclaimed : -but if i choose , nevertheless , i could force you to look glad !

what is this place ?
she will only be a baroness , which is a come down for her ; she was born a marquise

the senator above mentioned was a clever man , who had made his own way , heedless of those things which present obstacles , and which are called conscience , sworn faith , justice , duty : he had marched straight to his goal , without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest
it was the man with the axe , who was growing merry
the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit-picpus , a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud , whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise , and , consequently , worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall
wellington perceived it , and thought of his cavalry
none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man
he had said , i see yonder a cloud , which seems to me to be troops

he carried his head thrown backwards ; his shirt , widely opened and turned back , displayed his bull neck , white and bare
poor creature , he said in a low tone , and speaking to himself , he is hungry
then , although it was still broad daylight , -- it was summer , -- he lighted them
why had not javert arrested jean valjean ?
i ask nothing better , dom claude ; but what if i entangle myself in some villanous affair ?
m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading , with the aid of his glasses , two books of which he was passionately fond and in which , a serious thing at his age , he was interested

the whole thing was compact , overwhelming , and misshapen
moreover , as she knew nothing , she could say nothing , and then , she would not have said anything in any case
on recovering from his first stupefaction , he bestirred himself to shout , to the four personages on the stage , go on !
i do not ask for your secrets , you need not tell them to me , but i may be of use , nevertheless
they assembled in paris in two localities , near the fish-market , in a wine-shop called corinthe , of which more will be heard later on , and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue saint-michel called the cafe musain , now torn down ; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman , the second to the students
the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside , being concealed , as we have stated , beneath the elephant 's belly , and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it
he walked very near the street-posts , and guided himself along the walls of the houses
the sun had succeeded to the chandelier , and made its way gayly into the drawing-room

and all the reflections which that strange spectacle would awaken in us to-day ; that horrible cell , a sort of intermediary link between a house and the tomb , the cemetery and the city ; that living being cut off from the human community , and thenceforth reckoned among the dead ; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the darkness ; that remnant of life flickering in the grave ; that breath , that voice , that eternal prayer in a box of stone ; that face forever turned towards the other world ; that eye already illuminated with another sun ; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb ; that soul a prisoner in that body ; that body a prisoner in that dungeon cell , and beneath that double envelope of flesh and granite , the murmur of that soul in pain ; -- nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd
the reader has divined , no doubt , that thenardier 's pursuer was no other than javert
but , sad to say , from time to time , the exceptional becomes necessary
marius was now a thoroughly roused man
she sewed seventeen hours a day ; but a contractor for the work of prisons , who made the prisoners work at a discount , suddenly made prices fall , which reduced the daily earnings of working-women to nine sous
tis more than a year since the tail of a stone cart dashed against my window and broke in the grating
a few paces distant , an enormous pillar , then another , then another ; seven pillars in all , down the length of the hall , sustaining the spring of the arches of the double vault , in the centre of its width
the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees , cosette was meditating ; an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little , that invincible sadness evoked by the evening , and which arises , perhaps , who knows , from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour
i am here to do anything you wish
this is what i imagine , messire
this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable ; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion
cosette sufficed for his happiness ; the idea that he , perhaps , did not suffice for cosette 's happiness , that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness , did not even present itself to his mind
and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread
the child , whose thoughts were still on the thenardier , shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible
the door opened instantly , and allowed the new-corners to see an old woman and an old lamp , both of which trembled
yes , monsieur le maire
a pause ensued , as though both sides were waiting
and she went on : this is what i call being good : being nice and coming and living here , -- there are birds here as there are in the rue plumet , -- living with us , quitting that hole of a rue de l'homme arme , not giving us riddles to guess , being like all the rest of the world , dining with us , breakfasting with us , being my father
but every evil thought is inexorable , and insists on becoming a deed ; but where i believed myself to be all powerful , fate was more powerful than i alas !
marius , vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place , asked this passer-by : -- what is the name of this spot ?

why do you wear old hats like this !
he draws his feet out of the sand , he tries to retrace his steps , he turns back , he sinks in more deeply than before

exclaimed the entire crowd , in one voice
two lackeys of the official torturer bathed the bleeding shoulders of the patient , anointed them with some unguent which immediately closed all the wounds , and threw upon his back a sort of yellow vestment , in cut like a chasuble

that , in the first place , it is very rare for any one to die of hunger , literally ; and next , that , fortunately or unfortunately , man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much , both morally and physically , without dying ; that it is therefore necessary to have patience ; that that would even have been better for those poor little children ; that it had been an act of madness for him , a miserable , unfortunate wretch , to take society at large violently by the collar , and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft ; that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters ; in short , that he was in the wrong

at dessert , m gillenormand , rising to his feet , with a glass of champagne in his hand -- only half full so that the palsy of his eighty years might not cause an overflow , -- proposed the health of the married pair
twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras , and silently made ready their guns
she had always been predestined to gentleness ; but faith , charity , hope , those three virtues which mildly warm the soul , had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
at that moment , a distinct cry arose in the buzzing throng which surrounded him , let ’ s take him to the king !
she owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led
superposed , the one upon the other ?
the man is well pinioned
fortunately , the doctor had been warned , and he now made his appearance
enjolras expressed its divine right , and combeferre its natural right
she gazed about her on all sides
towards the middle of the day , after having , from time to time , for the sake of resting herself , travelled , for three or four sous a league , in what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris , the little suburban coach service , fantine found herself at montfermeil , in the alley boulanger
once outside of the house , he made for the rue du petit-banquier
the children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle
sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest , he said : look at the people of embrun !
she thought herself victorious , and continued , --
have no fear of me
he wrote slowly the few following lines : cosette , i bless thee
he was filled with regret and remorse , and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb
he came , examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken
i hope that he will not consent to it
you have dressed up
now , these parents groan , these old folks implore us , these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons ; they desire our return , and offer to kill calves for usbeing virtuous , we obey them
shrieked the hair-dresser , who from white had turned blue , that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it
from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow , and he had followed , all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death
night was falling ; the square was dark ; the wine-shop , full of candles , flamed afar like a forge in the gloom ; the noise of glasses and feasting , of oaths and quarrels , which escaped through the broken panes , was audible
he put all these questions to himself without replying to them
he said to me : no , give me your address , my daughter has some purchases to make , i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do
come along and drink , he cried , since it is i who pays the bill
his daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace , the elder engaged in dressing the younger 's wounded hand
this liberty goes very far
the man turned round
said the archdeacon , a crucible for alchemy
invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street ; snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night
a revolt was , in its eyes , no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths , and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril
a simple matter , nevertheless --
he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man , who was , in his eyes , both equivocal and imposing
the moment has arrived , it seems to me ; let us discuss the question
you are an inn-keeper , are you not ?
she shall be brought hither
i was house-surgeon in that hospital
monseigneur is what they call him
so he resembles me !
they are becoming extinguished
each one felt herself , in some sort , wounded in her beauty
fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich , while he , a lawyer , was being ruined
he made up his mind to save m madeleine
at the age of twenty , by special dispensation of the holy see , he was a priest , and served as the youngest of the chaplains of notre-dame the altar which is called , because of the late mass which is said there , _altare pigrorum_
go to filspierre , between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil , and you will find work
and besides , the light might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochere , and all the bobbies need to do is to see it
he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger
people who have ascended the towers of notre-dame know that there is a swell of the stone immediately beneath the balustrade
people would drive away the graces as being too low in the neck
the whole of progress tends in the direction of solution
with cosette 's garter , homer would construct the iliad
i assure you that we were all weeping also
you can get as much as you want
in this open-air society , it is the rag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes
gieffroy mabonne , gendarme bearing the crossbow
all is over then
my drawing-room , which contains no furniture , and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing , is fifteen feet in height , eighteen square , with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded , and with beams , as in yours
la esmeralda was sleeping at the moment when the outcasts assailed the church
a whole political school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun , we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
on another occasion , alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry , he wrote in connection with a political criminal , who is one of the most generous figures of our day : his pardon is granted ; it only remains for me to obtain it
how was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the cannon-balls ?
said he , there 's the wick giving out
enjolras , pale , with bare neck and dishevelled hair , and his woman 's face , had about him at that moment something of the antique themis
cosette had meant to scratch , and she lacerated
the wretched man tries to sit down , to lie down , to climb ; every movement that he makes buries him deeper ; he straightens himself up , he sinks ; he feels that he is being swallowed up ; he shrieks , implores , cries to the clouds , wrings his hands , grows desperate
in the incomprehensible plan of these streets , one distinguished likewise , on looking attentively , two clusters of great streets , like magnified sheaves of grain , one in the university , the other in the town , which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates
at moments , in that dizzy depth , a gleam of light appeared , and undulated vaguely , water possessing the power of taking light , no one knows whence , and converting it into a snake
to cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries , to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire , to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army , to make its legions fly forth over all the earth , as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer , to dominate , to strike with lightning , to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory , to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of titans , to conquer the world twice , by conquest and by dazzling , that is sublime ; and what greater thing is there ?
i have lost it , replied gringoire
he replaced the pocketbook in marius ' pocket
that volley of grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick building on the right of the road at a few minutes ' distance before you enter genappe
how i do lie !
he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou
the wise people said to the foolish : don ’ t go there !
i have that fatality hanging over me that , not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration , that consideration humiliates me , and crushes me inwardly , and , in order that i may respect myself , it is necessary that i should be despised
one can consent to it for the first hour ; one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron , one places on one 's head the crown of hot iron , one accepts the globe of red hot iron , one takes the sceptre of red hot iron , but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned , and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering ?
cosette , who only understood in a very confused manner , redoubled her caresses , as though she desired to pay marius ' debt
it was not easy to see these two men , except from the quay opposite , and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance , the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling , tattered , and equivocal being , who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse , and the other like a classic and official personage , wearing the frock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin
great things had been accomplished , with it alongside
the hydra at the beginning , the angel at the end
marius lowered his head in his turn ; that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel , and he felt it vanishing within him
i have read a great deal of plato , but nothing of it remains by me ; better than malebranche and then lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me , i obeyed thee , thou didst submit to me ; oh gilded garret !
terror chilled the very marrow of her bones ; she stood there bewildered and stupefied
he has an astonished air , he pretends to be stupid ; it is far better
what if you should meet them !
in number , in a number of streets , in the rue de l'etoile , the rue saint-louis , the rue du temple , the rue vielle-dutemple , the rue notre-dame de nazareth , the rue folie-mericourt , the quai aux fleurs , the rue du petit-muse , the rue du normandie , the rue pont-aux-biches , the rue des marais , the faubourg saint-martin , the rue notre dame des-victoires , the faubourg montmartre , the rue grange-bateliere , in the champs-elysees , the rue jacob , the rue de tournon , the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw
condemn the victim and to spare the assassin !
noonday alone had arrived on time
the archdeacon , who was very much embarrassed by such a visit in such a place , trembled in his arm-chair
on the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people
j'ai fort lu platon , mais rien ne m'en reste ; mieux que malebranche et que lamennais , tu me demontrais la bonte celeste avec une fleur que tu me donnais
it is not permitted to fall asleep , either in the shadow of a machineel tree , nor in the shadow of an army
on the numberth of june , number , the rains had still farther increased this acclivity , the mud complicated the problem of the ascent , and the men not only slipped back , but stuck fast in the mire
the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals
good old folks , let us smash with our crutches that louvre where the monarchy displayed itself in furbelows
certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape , ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined
fine gentry are our people of the university , not to have caused our privileges to be respected on such a day as this !
i leave you , madame , they are waiting for you
he sought to collect his faculties , but could not
the sainte-marthe chamber , said he
then she struck him with the fury of a child
they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast , under his shirt , which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon
he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering , and he accepted , as the process of civilization , social damnation
no , it was not you who came to montfermeil , to my inn , eight years ago , on christmas eve , number !
he made no reply
one would have said that this hand was riveted to her arm
the father exclaimed : -go in , nevertheless
the installation over , the town waited to see its bishop at work
fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts
if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo , this was the means employed by charles the fifth , desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication
at recreation hours , jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance , and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest
no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus ; he was some unknown blouse-wearer , a stranger , a man forgotten , a passing hero , that great anonymous , always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who , at a given moment , utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word , and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute , in a lightning flash , the people and god
sometimes even several of them at a time
the royalty of july reared up , in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets
the ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household
boulatruelle , accustomed to taking crooked courses , was on this occasion guilty of the fault of going straight
i , the person who is speaking to you , was present
he told him the best truths , which are also the most simple
the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth , and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes
it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak
that which is on high at the summit , at the crest , at the zenith , that which sends down so much light on the earth , sees but little , sees badly , sees not at all ?
is it not the sower ?
in this manner she reached the spring
she began to laugh
can one be more white and blonde ?
there was no longer anything in the street ; there was nothing in the garden
this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer ; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it
nevertheless , whatever may be the contrast , all these toilers , from the highest to the most nocturnal , from the wisest to the most foolish , possess one likeness , and this is it : disinterestedness
her candle had burned all night , and was almost entirely consumed
the matter is simple
you must go there after you are married
was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres , sixteen sous , eight farthings , which the future king charles vii
then his chest sank in , his head wavered , as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him
in the tenth year his turn came round again ; he again profited by it ; he succeeded no better
he did not stir
he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire
was the fire wholly extinct there ?
this man has insinuated himself into your confidence , and almost into your family under a false name
he said to himself : there may still be a glimpse of life there , perchance ; i will risk my own existence for that miserable spark !
the poor children , including gavroche , were famished
it was not an affirmation that he made , but a question which he put to himself : is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert ?
the generous quarrel began afresh
the little fellows nudged each other , the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time , and then , it was raining very hard
she set about arranging the table ; her husband paced the room
some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach , and that he had already , on the previous day , made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village , for he had not been seen in the village itself
the wretched woman began to laugh in her wild way
one must resign one 's self
his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes
he was even the author of the monumental window
he could not refrain from clapping his hands
from the question of the scaffold to the question of war , their works embraced everything
his hands , which rested on his knees , began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers
an intercepted letter read : the day is not far distant when , within four hours by the clock , eighty thousand patriots will be under arms
jean valjean , armed with his bar of iron , walked slowly up to fantine 's couch
these voices had this strange characteristic , that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted
his face , an inexhaustible repertory of masks , produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale
could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid ?
pontmercy fought at spire , at worms , at neustadt , at turkheim , at alzey , at mayence , where he was one of the two hundred who formed houchard 's rearguard
it is not hard to meet him
enjolras said : joly is ill , grantaire is drunk
he looked at it , and recognized a wooden shoe , a frightful shoe of the coarsest description , half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud
he thought to himself
everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open
and so have i , said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror , i have something to say to the very reverend mother
as she spoke thus , with her other arm extended through the window , she showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe
she never made a mistake about anything , and she saw things justly
the english barricaded themselves there ; the french made their way in , but could not stand their ground
i do not understand you , said gervaise
and one day i saw a bishop there
they let me out !
but in a few days fantine disarmed them
it was not long in presenting itself
you owe me reparation
the name of a woman should be agreeable , sweet , fanciful ; it should end in long vowels , and resemble words of benediction
this jean valjean instantly comprehended
on the evening before , in the darkness , the barricade had been approached silently , as by a boa
said he , adjusting himself as well as possible , i must resign myself
ever since number , petty partial revolts had been going on here and there , which were quickly suppressed , but ever bursting forth afresh , the sign of a vast underlying conflagration
progress infallibly awakes , and , in short , we may say that it marches on , even when it is asleep , for it has increased in size
had i been able to tear out that thread , to break it , to undo the knot or to cut it , to go far away , i should have been safe
this communicates with the abyss
repeated marius in a rage
this had its disadvantages
she had not been there on the preceding evening , and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said : it appears that there is a row
the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity
the indefinite , which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite , escapes them
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
all of a sudden , he would burst out laughing
the first auditor whom messire miles d ’ isliers , doctor in decretals , saw arrive every monday morning , all breathless , at the opening of the gates of the school of the chef-saint-denis , was claude frollo
must men be cold and feel uncomfortable ?
it is art which has changed its skin
in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard , he saw the four lines which follow : -my dearest , alas !
of course , continued the small imp on the capital , what are they laughing at ?
mr marius , are you there ?
two surtouts are a good thing , murmured fauchelevent , who really was a little hard of hearing
exclaimed the archdeacon , at the moment when the juggler , perspiring heavily , passed in front of him with his pyramid of chair and his cat , what is master pierre gringoire doing here ?
does your arm hurt you ?
inquiry was made at that convent ; the very best information and the most respectable references abounded ; the good nuns , not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity , and not attaching any importance to the matter , had never understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter
i do not want your angel , i want my child !
as he plunged into the side aisles , he perceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars
they sang their little ca ira : -- ah !
and when a village curate came to d -- -- , the bishop still found means to entertain him , thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire , and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine
as he spoke , he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron , and he continued : -hold , i know now
said the poor girl , and i thought my name pretty because of its singularity !
we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present
courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf
a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house
fantine was beautiful , and remained pure as long as she couldshe was a lovely blonde , with fine teeth
this was lugubrious in the darkness , and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other
the abbe de la trappe replies to horace
woman , resumed tholomyes ; distrust her
let us tell the truth , we who are initiated , and who have raised the veil of isis : there is no such thing as either good or evil ; there is vegetation
at every blow he traced around him a great circle of severed limbs
these flowers were his occupation
you see , my benefactor , no bread , no fire
the captain was the first to break the silence
it was a new lodger who has come into the house , said the old woman
when she recovered her senses , she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain , bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared ; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open ; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her ,
the corridor was long , the staircase steep , jondrette was talkative , m leblanc had , no doubt , not yet regained his carriage ; if , on turning round in the corridor , or on the staircase , he were to catch sight of him , marius , in that house , he would , evidently , take the alarm , and find means to escape from him again , and this time it would be final
this solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes : monstrous opulence , monstrous wretchedness
when the nettle is young , the leaf makes an excellent vegetable ; when it is older , it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax
its quay , broken or interrupted in many places , ran along the seine , from the tour de billy to the tour du bois ; that is to say , from the place where the granary stands to-day , to the present site of the tuileries
the priest saw it , and tested with the tip of his finger the point of a poniard which he wore concealed in his breast
sent two hundred phials of it to the pope
the man , without making any reply , fumbled in his pocket , and thenardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more
the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum-beats , clamors , platoon firing , and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon
he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it , with the rigid rapidity of a projectile ; the alley of l'homme arme became silent and solitary once more ; in a twinkling , that strange child , who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream , had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses , and was lost there , like smoke in the dark ; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished , had there not taken place , a few minutes after his disappearance , a startling shiver of glass , and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois
by the way , my dear captain , you just mentioned the rue coupe-gueule that is a very bad form of speech ; people are no longer so barbarous
he put his pocketbook back in his pocket , then he called gavroche
two or three times
cut-throat , yes ; cutpurse , no
he had remained , therefore , for several minutes , leaning in silence against the carved jamb of the chimney , and thinking or not thinking , when fleur-de-lys suddenly turned and addressed him
these men do not recognize me !
an iron neck-collar was hanging in one of these cells
you make me boil , gringoire
it fills the first-comer with the force of events ; it converts everything into projectiles
he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account
he is napoleon 's stay and danton 's resourceis it a question of country , he enlists ; is it a question of liberty , he tears up the pavements
they began to wander aimlessly through the streets
my dear fellow , then in order to please her , you must be elegant , and produce effects with your knees
is this your little girl ?
what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation ?
a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there , swelling hearts and enlarging souls
he made no reply
the thenardier inquired of the traveller
independently of the original and individual contribution of each writer , there are collective contingents
a bourgeois had the air of a flower , a marquis had the air of a precious stone
whispered courfeyrac to jean prouvaire
in this unknown , every step that he risked might be his last
in truth , said gringoire to himself , she is a salamander , she is a nymph , she is a goddess , she is a bacchante of the menelean mount !
the song died away
at the shock of the beam , the half metallic door sounded like an immense drum ; it was not burst in , but the whole cathedral trembled , and the deepest cavities of the edifice were heard to echo
we shall not try to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose , that horseshoe mouth ; that little left eye obstructed with a red , bushy , bristling eyebrow , while the right eye disappeared entirely beneath an enormous wart ; of those teeth in disarray , broken here and there , like the embattled parapet of a fortress ; of that callous lip , upon which one of these teeth encroached , like the tusk of an elephant ; of that forked chin ; and above all , of the expression spread over the whole ; of that mixture of malice , amazement , and sadness
having never had any money , i never acquired the habit of it , and the result is that i have never lacked it ; but , if i had been rich , there would have been no more poor people !
she comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you
and he held out the envelope containing the four letters
he had a pointed thing , made of gold , on his head ; it glittered in the bright light of midday
enjolras brought the square coffer , and courfeyrac opened it
to mingle with one 's life a certain presence of the sepulchre , -- this is the law of the sage ; and it is the law of the ascetic
all these things , realities full of spectres , phantasmagories full of realities , had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable
the windows had short curtains , a sign that there was a woman about
the man was sitting there , and letting cosette get somewhat rested
nevertheless , in spite of all this , and because of all this , his passion augmented and grew to madness
monsieur pontmercy , you pardon me !
he had eaten nothing all day ; it is probable that he was feverish
in the meantime aunt gillenormand , a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties , had finally hunted up marius ' abode
the sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side , the priests of the officiality on the other
his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him
it is because it was six hundred years in building
it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors : people avoided him when he went out ; he perceived the fact
i have been robbed , said the officer ; i am sorry for that
and turning to marius : -my brother is here
this was his axiom : there is but one certainty , my full glass
got rid of is the word
was he seized at the age of forty-six with a supreme madness ?
you are finely taken aback , and really , you are excessively ignorant
marius entered , his head well up , his mouth smiling , an indescribable light on his countenance , his brow expanded , his eyes triumphant
that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card , and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings , since it was in fauchelevent 's pocket
it seemed , from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth , -- incoherent , impetuous , pell-mell , tumbling over each other , -- as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once
when they were exhausted , when these formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball , each grasped in his hands two of the bottles which enjolras had reserved , and of which we have spoken , and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs
they , on their side , did not appear even to see him
the king looked him full in the face
hesitations , scruples , particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand
at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted ; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope , which traversed the street from side to side , and was adjusted in a groove of the post
but can not you get out by the way in which you entered ?
the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second
ou vont les belles filles , lon la
he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty , if being at liberty is to be hunted , to turn the head every instant , to quake at the slightest noise , to be afraid of everything , -- of a smoking roof , of a passing man , of a barking dog , of a galloping horse , of a striking clock , of the day because one can see , of the night because one can not see , of the highway , of the path , of a bush , of sleep
jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece , where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint
he was directing his course towards the belt sewer ; he was on the right path
we were attached to the same chain for five years
no , phoebus , no ; i will be thy mistress , thy amusement , thy pleasure , when thou wilt ; a girl who shall belong to thee
the insurgents did not reply to this musketry , in order to spare their ammunition the fusillade broke againstthe barricade ; but the street , which it filled , was terrible
m madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures
it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth , to confide themselves to that black gloom , and to trust to providence for the outcome
it is certain that the provincial was on the point of taking offence , for the honor of her pillory
he took a circuit , turned into the passage des patriarches , which was closed on account of the hour , strode along the rue de l'epee-de-bois and the rue de l'arbalete , and plunged into the rue des postes
but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again
and you will come out at fifty !
they were alone in the garden
monsieur fabantou , he said , these five francs are all that i have about me , but i shall now take my daughter home , and i will return this evening , -- it is this evening that you must pay , is it not ?
the lawyer left him
a fine pleasure to produce , when you walk , the same noise as the quay of old iron , in an earthquake !
all four were madly pretty
it seems to me at times that you are a dream
they passed the bakeshop , but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch
it was joy , splendor , riches , happiness , which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery
in the second place , are you the discharged convict , jean valjean -- yes or no ?
the revolution of july had been a fine popular gale , abruptly followed by blue sky
on emerging upon the place , he laughed yet more heartily
paris is the centre of two sheets , a sheet of water and a sheet of air
the central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages , whose birds , reared by himself , sang for him alone
when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom
then turning to the elder : -there now !
-- and the house assumes the air of a tomb
it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts , you shall give her your arm , you know , as you used to , in the luxembourg
they had stopped crying
who will plant the flag on the barricade again ?
a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle
at the same time , over his childish countenance which was , at once so impudent and so serious , so giddy and so profound , so gay and so heart-breaking , passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify : ah bah !
the soldiers fly from him , shouting , long live marshal ney !
the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms
who thus soils the triumph ?
he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette , where they could both hide themselves
she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier : -may i , madame ?
no idiom is more metaphorical than slang : devisser le coco ( to unscrew the nut ) , to twist the neck ; tortiller ( to wriggle ) , to eat ; etre gerbe , to be tried ; a rat , a bread thief ; il lansquine , it rains , a striking , ancient figure which partly bears its date about it , which assimilates long oblique lines of rain , with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers , and which compresses into a single word the popular expression : it rains halberds
and of the dean , m delvincourt : what a monument !
but how was it to be done ?
the man resumed tranquilly , put me in the stable
the priest ’ s eye was staring , wild , flaming , and remained riveted on the horrible little group of the spider and the fly
their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness
when one heard her speak , one said , that is a gendarme ; when one saw her drink , one said , that is a carter ; when one saw her handle cosette , one said , that is the hangman
but there came a moment when the child trembled ; madame thenardier raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove , then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern

he never went about otherwise than surrounded by a small court of bishops and abbés of high lineage , gallant , jovial , and given to carousing on occasion ; and more than once the good and devout women of saint germain d ’ auxerre , when passing at night beneath the brightly illuminated windows of bourbon , had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had intoned vespers for them during the day carolling , to the clinking of glasses , the bacchic proverb of benedict xii , that pope who had added a third crown to the tiara -- _bibamus papaliter_
