just three hundred and forty-eight years , six months , and nineteen days ago today parisians woke to the sound of all the bells pealing out within the triple precinct of city , university , and town .
the sixth of january 1482 is not , however , a day commemorated by history .
there was nothing very special about the event which thus launched the bells and the people of paris into movement from early in the morning .
it was not an attack by picards or burgundians , not a procession of relics , not a student revolt in the laas vineyard , not our aforesaid most dread sovereign lord the king ’ making his entry , not even the fine spectacle of men and women being hanged for robbery at the palais de justice in paris .
nor was it the arrival of some embassy , a frequent occurrence in the fifteenth century , all bedizened and plumed .
it was hardly two days since the last cavalcade of that kind , the flemish embassy sent to conclude the marriage of the dauphin and marguerite of flanders , had entered paris , much to the annoyance of the cardinal de bourbon , who , to please the king , had had to put on a welcoming smile for this rustic bunch of flemish burgomasters and treat them , in his hôtel de bourbon , to a very fine morality , satire , and farce ’ , while torrential rain soaked the magnificent tapestries hung at his door .
what , in the words of jean de troyes , excited all the people of paris ’ on 6 january was the twofold celebration , combined since time immemorial , of the feast of the epiphany and the feast of fools .
that day there was to be a bonfire on the place de grève , a maypole set up at the chapel of braque , and a mystery play at the palais de justice .
the news had been publicly proclaimed with trumpet calls at all the crossroads by the provost ’ s men , in their handsome tunics of purple camlet , with big white crosses on the front .
from early morning the crowd of townsfolk , men and women , had begun to come in from all directions , leaving houses and shops closed up , making their way towards one of the three appointed places .
everyone had made a choice , some for the bonfire , some for the maypole , some for the mystery .
it must be said , in praise of the age-old good sense of curious parisians , that the majority of this crowd was making for the bonfire , which came very seasonably , or the mystery , to be performed in the sheltered and enclosed great hall of the palais , and that , by common consent , the curious left the poor maypole , with its scanty garlands , to shiver all alone under the january sky in the cemetery of the chapel of braque .
the flood of people was particularly dense in the roads leading to the palais de justice , because it was known that the flemish ambassadors , who had arrived two days earlier , intended to be present at the performance of the mystery play and the election of the pope of fools , which was also to take place in the great hall .
it was no easy matter that day to gain admission to the great hall , though at the time it was reputed to be the largest enclosed and covered space in the world .
to onlookers watching from their windows the place du palais , blocked with people , presented the appearance of a vast sea into which a dozen streets , like so many river mouths , continually disgorged fresh streams of heads .
the waves of this human flood , constantly spreading , broke against the corners of houses projecting here and there like headlands into the irregular basin formed by the place .
in the centre of the tall , gothic1 façade of the palais was the grand staircase ; up and down it flowed continuously a double stream , breaking on the central flight of steps , and then spreading out in broad waves over its two lateral flights .
the shouts of laughter , the tramping of these thousands of feet , set up a great noise and clamour .
now and then this noise and clamour grew louder , the current driving the whole crowd towards the grand staircase ebbed , broke into turbulence and eddies .
it was an archer thumping somebody , or the horse of one of the provost-sergeants kicking out to restore order—an admirable tradition bequeathed by the provost ’ s men to the constabulary , by the constabulary to the mounted police , and by the mounted police to our modern paris gendarmerie .
at doors , windows , skylights , on the roofs , swarmed thousands of citizens , with good , solid , honest faces , just looking at the palais , looking at the throng , and perfectly satisfied to do so , for plenty of people in paris are quite content with the spectacle of spectators , and curiosity is easily aroused by a wall behind which something is going on .
if it could be given to us , men of 1830 , to mingle in thought with these fifteenth-century parisians and join them as they go , tugged , jostled , shoved into this immense hall in the palais , so cramped on that 6 january 1482 , the spectacle would not prove to be without interest or appeal , and everything around us would be so old as to strike us as a novelty .
with the reader ’ s permission we shall try to recreate in imagination the impression he would have shared with us as he crossed the threshold of the great hall amid this throng of people dressed in surcoat , tunic , and kirtle .
first of all we feel a buzzing in our ears , our eyes are dazzled .
above our heads a double ogive vault , panelled with wooden carvings , painted sky-blue , sprinkled with golden fleurs-de-lys , beneath our feet a marble pavement with alternate slabs of black and white .
a few paces away stands an enormous pillar , then another and another ; seven pillars in all down the length of the hall , supporting in the middle of its width the springing of the double vaults .
round the first four pillars stand traders ’ stalls , sparkling with glass and tinsel ; round the last three are set oaken benches , worn smooth and polished by the breeches of litigants and the robes of lawyers .
all round the hall , along the lofty walls , between the doors , between the windows , between the pillars , is an endless range of statues of every king of france since pharamond ; the do-nothing kings , arms slack and eyes downcast ; the valorous warrior kings , head and hands raised boldly up to heaven .
then , in the tall pointed windows , stained glass of countless hues ; at the spacious arches leading to the hall , finely carved and splendid doors ; and the whole , vaults , pillars , walls , window frames , panelling , doors , statues , all covered from top to bottom with splendid gold and blue illumination , already slightly faded by the time we are looking at it , and almost completely hidden beneath dust and cobwebs in the year of grace 1549 when du breul still admired it as tradition demanded .
now imagine this vast oblong hall , lit by the wan light of a january day , invaded by a motley , noisy crowd drifting round the walls and swirling round the pillars , and you will already have a vague idea of the whole scene which we shall try to depict in more precise and curious detail .
it is certain that if ravaillac had not assassinated henri iv there would have been no documents from ravaillac ’ s trial to be deposited in the registry of the palais de justice ; no accomplices with an interest in making the said documents disappear ; hence no arsonists obliged , for want of any better method , to burn down the registry in order to burn the documents and to burn down the palais de justice in order to burn the registry ; in short , therefore , no great fire in 1618. the old palais would still be standing with its old great hall ; i could say to the reader go and see it ’ , and we should both be spared the trouble , i of composing , he of reading , any detailed description of it .
which proves a new truth : great events have incalculable consequences .
it is true that ravaillac may quite possibly have had no accomplices , and then that his accomplices , if perchance he had any , had nothing to do with the fire of 1618. there are two other , quite plausible explanations for it .
first , the great fiery star , a foot wide and a cubit high , which fell , as everyone knows , from the sky on to the palais , after midnight on 7 march .
[ it was indeed poor sport when dame justice in paris took too much spicy food/in bribes and set all her palate/palais ablaze . ]
whatever one may think of this triple explanation , political , physical , poetical , for the conflagration of the palais de justice in 1618 , the one unfortunately certain fact is the conflagration .
almost everything has disappeared .
what has become of the bedroom in the chancellery where st louis consummated his marriage ’ ?
the garden where he dispensed justice , wearing a camlet tunic , a sleeveless linseywoolsey surcoat , with a black sendal cloak on top , reclining on carpets with joinville ’ ?
that of charles iv ?
where is the staircase from which charles vi promulgated his edict of mercy ?
the slab on which marcel , in the dauphin ’ s presence , murdered robert de clermont and the maréchal de champagne ?
the wicket where the bulls of the anti-pope benedict were torn up , and from whence those who had brought them set out again , mockingly decked in cope and mitre , to make amende honorable right through paris ?
and the great hall , with its gilding , its azure colouring , pointed arches , statues , pillars , the immense vault fretted with carvings ?
and the gilded chamber ?
and the stone lion standing at the door , head down and tail between his legs , like the lions of solomon ’ s throne , in the humbly submissive posture befitting strength before justice ?
and the fine doors ?
and stained-glass windows ?
and the chased ironwork which made biscornette lose heart ?
and the delicate joinery of du hancy ?
what have the years , what have men done to these marvels ?
what have they given us in place of it all , all that gaulish history , all that gothic art ?
the heavy surbased arches of monsieur de brosse , the clumsy architect of the portail saint-gervais , so much for art ; and as for history , we have the garrulous memories of the great pillar , still echoing with the patrus ’ gossip .
it is not very much—let us return to the real great hall of the real old palais .
one end of this gigantic parallelogram contained the famous marble table , so long , broad , and thick , according to the old registers , in a style to whet gargantua ’ s appetite , that never had there been seen such a slab of marble anywhere in the world ’ .
the other end contained the chapel where louis xi had had himself sculptured kneeling before the virgin , and to which he had transferred , heedless of the two niches left empty in the row of royal statues , those of charlemagne and st louis , two saints who , he supposed , must enjoy much favour in heaven as kings of france .
this chapel , still new , its construction dating from barely six years before , was all conceived with that delightful taste for delicate architecture , wonderful sculpture , precise and deeply incised tracery which in france marks the end of the gothic age and survives until about the middle of the sixteenth century in the magical fantasies of the renaissance .
the little open-work rose-window pierced over the doorway was in particular a masterpiece of lightness and grace ; it looked like a star woven from lace .
in the middle of the hall , opposite the great door , a tribune of gold brocade had been set up against the wall , with its own entrance contrived through a window in the passage leading to the gilded chamber ; this was for the flemish envoys and other important persons invited to the performance of the mystery play .
according to custom the mystery was to be performed actually on the marble table .
it had been prepared to that end early that morning ; its rich slab of marble , scored by the heels of the law clerks , bore a frame of scaffolding of a considerable height , the upper surface of which , visible from every part of the hall , was to serve as the stage , while the inside , screened by tapestries , was to be used as a dressing room for the actors .
a ladder , artlessly placed outside , afforded communication between stage and dressing room , and its steep rungs had to serve for exits as well as entrances .
no character so unexpected , no twist of plot , no dramatic suspense but had to climb this ladder .
innocent and venerable infancy of art and stage machinery !
four sergeants of the bailiff of the palais , whose duty was to stand guard over all popular entertainments , whether holidays or executions , stood at the four corners of the marble table .
the play was not due to commence until the last stroke of twelve came from the great clock in the palais .
that was certainly late for a theatrical performance , but the time had to be set to suit the ambassadors .
now all this multitude had been waiting since morning .
a good number of these honest spectators had been shivering since daybreak in front of the great steps of the palais ; some even claimed to have spent the night lying in the great doorway to be sure of entering first .
the crowd grew denser all the time , and like water overflowing its level , began rising up the walls , surging round the pillars , spilling over the entablatures , cornices , window ledges , over all the architectural projections , all the protrusions of the sculptures .
so discomfort , impatience , boredom , the liberated feeling of a day devoted to licence and folly , the quarrels continually breaking out over too sharp a nudge or a kick from a hobnailed boot , the tedium of a long wait , all this well before the hour appointed for the ambassadors ’ arrival , lent a sour and bitter note to the clamour of this mass of people cribbed , cabined , confined , trampled , suffocated .
all that could be heard were curses on the flemings , the provost of merchants , cardinal de bourbon , the bailiff of the palais , madame marguerite of austria , the sergeants with their wands , the cold , the heat , the bad weather , the bishop of paris , the pope of fools , the pillars , the statues , this closed door , that open window , all to the great amusement of the bands of students and lackeys scattered through the mass , who stirred into all this discontent their own teasing and mischief , adding pinpricks to exacerbate the general ill humour .
among others there was a group of these merry devils who , after smashing the glass , had boldly ensconced themselves on the entablature of a window , and thence stared and jeered outside and inside in turn at the crowd in the hall and the crowd in the place outside .
from their gestures of mimicry , their roars of laughter , the banter and jeering cries they exchanged with one another from one end of the hall to the other , it was obvious that these young clerks did not share the boredom and weariness of those present , and knew very well how to turn the sight before their eyes into an entertainment for their private pleasure which gave them patience to wait for the other .
upon my soul , it ’ s you , joannes frollo de molendino , one of them cried out to a little fair-haired devil , with a comely , mischievous face , clinging to the carved acanthus leaves of a capital .
you are well named jehan of the mill ; your arms and legs look like four mill-sails turning in the wind .
how long have you been here ?
by the devil ’ s mercy , joannes frollo replied ; more than four hours now , and i have every hope of having them counted against my time in purgatory .
i heard the eight singing-men of the king of sicily intone the opening verse of the seven o ’ clock high mass from the sainte-chapelle .
fine singers , retorted the other ; their voices are even sharper than their pointed caps !
before he endowed a mass for st john , the king should have found out whether the worthy st john enjoys latin chanted with a provençal accent .
he did it to give work to those damned singers of the king of sicily !
screeched an old woman in the crowd below the window .
i ask you !
a thousand livres parisis for a mass !
and paid for from the tax on salt-water fish sold in the paris market , what ’ s more !
hold your peace , old woman , put in a stout and stately individual holding his nose as he stood beside the fishwife ; a mass certainly had to be endowed .
surely you didn ’ t want the king to fall sick again ?
bravely spoken , sir gilles lecornu , master skinner and furrier of the king ’ s wardrobe !
a roar of laughter from all the students greeted the unfortunate name of the poor skinner-furrier of the king ’ s wardrobe .
cornutus et hirsutus [ horned and hairy ] , added another .
there is his honour gilles lecornu , brother of maître jacques lecornu , provost of the king ’ s household , son of maître mahiet lecornu , head porter of the bois de vincennes , all burghers of paris , all married from father to son !
the stout furrier , without answering a word , strove to escape the eyes gazing at him from every side , but he sweated and puffed in vain ; like a wedge being driven into wood , the only result of his efforts was to clamp still more tightly between his neighbours ’ shoulders his great apoplectic face , purple with vexation and rage .
finally one of these neighbours , short , stout , and respectable like him , came to his aid :
the whole band burst out : ho there !
who is singing that song ?
who is that screechowl of ill omen ?
there , i know who he is , said one ; he ’ s maître andry musnier .
because he ’ s one of the four official booksellers of the university !
everything in that dump goes in fours , cried a third ; four nations , four faculties , four holidays , four proctors , four electors , four booksellers .
well then , jehan frollo put in , we ’ ll have to play four kinds of merry hell with them .
musnier , we ’ ll burn your books .
musnier , we ’ ll thrash your lackey .
musnier , we ’ ll rumple your wife .
good stout mademoiselle oudarde .
as fresh and merry as if she were a widow .
devil take you !
muttered maître andry musnier .
maître andry , jehan went on , still hanging on to his capital , shut up , or i ’ ll drop on your head !
maître andry looked up , seemed for a moment to be gauging the height of the pillar , the weight of the young rascal , mentally multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity , and shut up .
jehan , master of the battlefield , pressed on in triumph : i ’ d do it too , even if i am an archdeacon ’ s brother !
didn ’ t even see that our privileges were respected on a day like this !
why , there ’ s a maypole and a bonfire in the town ; a mystery play , pope of fools , and a flemish embassy in the city ; and in the university not a thing !
yet the place maubert is big enough !
replied one of the clerks stationed on the window ledge .
down with the rector , the electors and the proctors !
we must make a bonfire this evening in the champ-gaillard , the other continued , with maître andry ’ s books .
and the scribes ’ desks !
and the beadles ’ wands !
and the deans ’ spittoons !
and the proctors ’ sideboards !
and the electors ’ chests !
and the rector ’ s stools !
down with them all !
little jehan chimed in with the chorus ; down with maître andry , the beadles and the scribes , the theologians , doctors , and canon lawyers ; the proctors , the electors , and the rector !
this is the end of the world then , murmured andry , stopping up his ears .
talk of the rector !
here he comes , down in the place !
everyone tried to turn round and face the place .
is that really our venerable rector , maître thibaut ?
asked jehan frollo du moulin. , who could not see what was going on outside from the inside pillar to which he clung .
yes , yes , all the others answered , it ’ s him , it ’ s him all right , maître thibaut , the rector .
it was indeed the rector and all the university dignitaries going in procession to meet the embassy , and at that moment crossing the place du palais .
the students , pressing at the window , greeted them as they passed by with sarcastic sallies and ironic applause .
the rector , riding at the head of his company , took the first broadside : it was a rough one .
good-day , monsieur le recteur !
good-day to you !
how did he manage to be here , the old gambler ?
did he leave his dice behind ?
look at him trotting along on his mule !
its ears aren ’ t as long as his !
good-day , monsieur le recteur thibaut !
god save you !
did you throw many double sixes last night ?
his face all grey and drawn and hollow-eyed because he ’ s so fond of gambling and dice !
where are you going then , tybalde ad dados [ thibaut the dice ] , turning your back on the university and trotting off towards the town ?
he ’ s probably going to look for lodgings in the rue thibautodé , cried jehan du moulin .
the whole band repeated the pun in thunderous tones , with frenzied clapping .
you are off to look for lodgings in the rue thibautodé , aren ’ t you , monsieur le recteur , the man who gambles with the devil ?
then came the turn of the other dignitaries .
down with the beadles !
down with the mace-bearers !
tell me , robin poussepain , who ’ s that fellow ?
that ’ s gilbert de suilly , gilbertus de soliaco , chancellor of the collège d ’ autun .
here , here ’ s my shoe ; you are better placed than i am , throw it in his face .
saturnalitias mittimus ecce nuces [ here we send some saturnalian nuts ] .
down with the six theologians in their white surplices !
are they theologians there ?
i thought they were the six white geese sainte-geneviève pays the town for the fief of roogny .
down with the doctors !
down with all disputations , the regular ones and the occasional ones too .
here ’ s my cap for you , chancellor of sainte-geneviève !
you did me down—yes , it ’ s quite true !
he gave my place in the norman nation to little ascanio falzaspada , who belongs to the province of bourges , since he ’ s italian .
that ’ s not fair , said all the students .
down with the chancellor of sainte-geneviève !
maître joachim de ladehors !
devil choke the proctor of the german nation !
and the chaplains of the sainte-chapelle with their grey amices , cum tunicis grisis !
seu de pellibus grisis fourratisl [ or lined with grey fur !
masters of arts !
look at all those fine black copes !
all those fine red copes !
that makes a fine tail for the rector .
it ’ s like the doge of venice going to wed the sea .
the canons of sainte-geneviève !
abbot claude choart !
doctor claude choart !
are you looking for marie la giffarde ?
she ’ s in the rue de glatigny .
making the bed for the chief inspector of bawds .
paying her fourpence : quattuor denarios .
aut unum bombum [ or a fart ] .
do you want her to pay you on the nose ?
maître simon sanguin , elector of picardy , with his wife on the pillion .
post equitem sedet atra cura [ dark care sits behind the rider ] .
bold man , maître simon !
good-day , monsieur the elector !
good-night , madame the electress !
aren ’ t they lucky to be able to see it all , said joannes de molendino with a sigh , still perched up on the foliage of his capital .
meanwhile the university ’ s official bookseller , maître andry musnier , bent to whisper in the ear of the furrier of the king ’ s wardrobe , maître gilles lecornu .
i tell you , monsieur , it ’ s the end of the world .
the students ’ behaviour has never been so outrageous .
it ’ s all these damnable modern inventions that are the ruin of everything .
it ’ s the end of manuscripts , the end of books !
printing is killing off the book trade .
the end of the world is at hand !
i can see that from the way velvet material is coming in , said the furrier .
at that moment the clock struck twelve .
said the whole crowd with one voice .
the students fell silent , then there was a great bustling about , a great moving of heads and feet , a great explosion of coughs and nose-blowing ; everyone settled in their chosen positions , stood on tiptoe , bunched together ; then a great silence fell ; every neck remained outstretched , every mouth open , every eye turned to the marble table .
the bailiff ’ s four sergeants still stood there , stiff and motionless as four painted statues .
all eyes turned to the tribune reserved for the flemish envoys .
the door remained closed , the tribune empty .
this crowd had been waiting since early morning for three things : noon , the embassy from flanders , the mystery play .
only noon had been punctual .
this was really too much .
they waited one , two , three , five minutes , a quarter of an hour ; nothing came .
the tribune stayed empty , the stage silent .
meanwhile impatience gave way to anger .
people were expressing annoyance , still quietly , it is true .
came a subdued murmur .
the mood was one of ferment .
a storm , as yet only rumbling , hovered over the surface of the crowd .
it was jehan du moulin who struck the first spark .
the mystery , and to hell with the flemings !
he yelled with all the strength of his lungs , writhing like a serpent round his capital .
the crowd clapped their hands .
they repeated , and to hell with flanders !
we want the mystery , and we want it now , went on the student , or methinks we should hang the bailiff of the palais by way of comedy and morality .
well spoken , cried the people ; let ’ s start the hanging with his sergeants .
this met with loud cheers .
the four poor devils began to go pale and looked at each other .
the mob moved towards them , and they could already see the flimsy wooden balustrade separating them from it begin to bend and bulge under pressure from the crowd .
the moment was critical .
string them up !
rose the cry on every side .
at that moment the curtain of the dressing room described earlier parted , and through it came an individual whose mere appearance stopped the crowd and as if by magic changed its anger into curiosity .
this person , by no means reassured and shaking in every limb , came up to the edge of the marble table , with frequent bows , and the nearer he came the more they looked like genuflexions .
meanwhile calm had been gradually restored .
all that remained was the slight murmur always given off by a silent crowd .
gentlemen , he said , and ladies , citizens of this town , we are to have the honour of declaiming and performing before his eminence monsieur le cardinal a very fine morality play entitled : the good judgement of our lady the virgin mary .
i play jupiter .
his eminence is at this moment accompanying the most honourable embassy of monsieur the duke of austria ; which is being delayed at the present moment while they listen to the address of monsieur the rector of the university at the porte baudets .
as soon as the most eminent cardinal appears we shall begin .
it is certain that nothing less than jupiter ’ s intervention could have saved the four unfortunate sergeants of the bailiff of the palais .
if we had been fortunate enough to invent this most truthful story and consequently to have to answer for it before our lady of criticism , we could not at this moment be charged with the classical precept : ne deus intersit [ let there be no divine intervention ] .
besides , lord jupiter ’ s costume was most handsome and had helped considerably in calming the crowd by attracting all its attention .
jupiter wore a coat of mail covered in black velvet , with gilt studs ; on his head was a bycocket decorated with silver-gilt buttons ; and but for the rouge and bushy beard which each covered half his face ; but for the scroll of gilded pasteboard , sprinkled with sequins and bristling with strips of tinsel , in his hand , easily recognized by expert eyes as thunderbolts ; but for his flesh-coloured feet , sporting ribbons in the grecian style , he might have borne comparison , for the severity of his appearance , with a breton archer of monsieur de berry ’ s corps .
in the course of his oration , however , the satisfaction and admiration unanimously aroused by his costume diminished as he spoke , and when he reached the unfortunate conclusion : as soon as the most eminent cardinal arrives we shall begin ’ , his voice was drowned by thunderous booing .
the mystery right away !
cried the people .
and above all the other voices that of joannes de molendino could be heard , cutting through the hubbub like the fife in a charivari at nîmes : start right away !
the student was yelping .
down with jupiter and the cardinal de bourbon !
bawled robin poussepain and the other clerks perched on the window .
the morality now !
repeated the crowd .
string up the players and the cardinal !
poor jupiter , gaunt , aghast , pale under his rouge , dropped his thunderbolt , took his helmet in his hand ; then bowing and trembling he stammered : his eminence … the ambassadors … madame marguerite of flanders … ’ .
he did not know what to say .
truth to tell , he was afraid of being hanged .
hanged by the crowd for waiting , hanged by the cardinal for not waiting , all he could see on either side of him was an abyss that is a gallows .
fortunately someone came to rescue him and assume responsibility .
an individual , who stood within the balustrade in the space left clear round the marble table , had so far gone unnoticed , so completely was his long , slender person protected from every line of sight by the diameter of the pillar on which he was leaning .
but the other was too stunned to notice .
he said , my dear jupiter !
the other did not hear .
finally the tall , fair-haired man lost patience , and shouted almost directly into his face :
who ’ s calling me ?
said jupiter , as if waking up with a start .
i am , answered the man in black .
start at once , the other went on .
satisfy the crowd .
i ’ ll take care of placating monsieur the bailiff , and he ’ ll placate the cardinal .
jupiter breathed again .
worshipful citizens , he shouted with all the power in his lungs to the crowd which went on booing , we are starting at once .
cried the people .
they clapped their hands in deafening applause , and the hall was still rocking with cheers by the time jupiter had retired behind his curtain .
meanwhile , the unknown man who had so magically changed the storm into calm ’ as our dear old corneille puts it , had modestly returned to the obscurity of his pillar , where he could no doubt have remained invisible , motionless and silent as before , had he not been drawn away by two young women who , from their place in the front row of spectators , had observed his conversation with michel giborne/jupiter .
maître , said one of them , beckoning him closer …
do be quiet , my dear liénarde , said her neighbour , pretty , fresh-faced , and a brave sight in her best clothes .
he ’ s not a clerk , he ’ s a layman .
messire , said liénarde .
the stranger approached the balustrade .
what can i do for you , mademoiselle ?
he asked , as if anxious to oblige .
nothing , said liénarde in embarrassment , it ’ s my neighbour , gisquette-la-gencienne , who wants a word with you .
no , no , replied gisquette , blushing , it was liénarde who said : maître ; i told her she should say : messire .
the two girls dropped their eyes .
the man , who asked for nothing better than to engage them in conversation , looked at them with a smile .
so you have nothing to say to me , mesdemoiselles ?
nothing at all , replied gisquette .
no , nothing , said liénarde .
the tall , fair young man took a step back , but the two girls were curious and did not want to let him go .
messire , burst out gisquette eagerly , with a rush , like a lock-gate opening or a woman making up her mind , so you know that soldier who is to play the part of our lady the virgin in the mystery ?
you mean jupiter ’ s part ?
the nameless man replied .
oh , yes , said liénarde , isn ’ t she stupid !
so you know jupiter ?
answered the nameless one .
he has a fine beard !
is it going to be lovely , what they are going to say up there ?
gisquette asked timidly .
very lovely , mademoiselle , the nameless one replied without the slightest hesitation .
what will it be ?
the good judgement of our lady the virgin , a morality , if you please , mademoiselle .
ah , that ’ s different , answered liénarde .
a brief silence ensued .
it ’ s a brand new morality , never been used before .
so it ’ s not the same , said gisquette , as the one they put on two years ago , the day monsieur the legate made his entry , when they had three lovely girls representing … ’
sirens , said liénarde .
and stark naked , added the young man .
liénarde modestly dropped her eyes .
gisquette looked at her and did the same .
he went on with a smile : it was a most agreeable sight .
today it ’ s a morality specially composed for madame the princess of flanders .
will they sing bergerettes ?
said the stranger , in a morality ?
you must not confuse different kinds of play .
if it was a farce , that would be fine .
that ’ s a pity , gisquette replied .
that day , at the ponceau fountain , there were wild men and women fighting and striking different attitudes while they sang little motets and bergerettes .
what is suitable for a legate , the stranger said rather dryly , is not suitable for a princess .
and by them , liénarde went on , several bass instruments were playing most tunefully .
and for the refreshment of passers-by , continued gisquette , the fountain had three spouts pouring out wine , milk , and hippocras , for anyone to help themselves .
and a bit down from the ponceau , liénarde went on , at the trinité , there was a passion play without words .
don ’ t i remember !
cried gisquette : god on the cross , and the two thieves to left and right !
at this the young gossips , becoming excited at the memory of the legate ’ s entry , both began talking at once .
and further on , at the porte-aux-peintres , there were some other people in sumptuous clothes .
and at the holy innocents ’ fountain that huntsman chasing a deer with a great noise of hounds and hunting horns !
and at the paris boucherie those scaffolds representing the fortress of dieppe !
and when the legate went by , you know , gisquette , they launched their assault and all the english had their throats cut !
and at the châtelet , against the gate , there were some other lovely-looking actors !
and on the pont-au-change , which was all covered in hangings !
and when the legate went past they released more than two hundred dozen birds of every kind ; it was really lovely , liénarde .
it will be lovelier still today , their interlocutor finally put in , his patience apparently tried as he listened to them .
do you promise it will be a fine mystery today ?
absolutely , he answered ; then he added with some emphasis , mesdemoiselles , i am the author .
said the girls , quite astounded .
the poet answered , rather preening himself : that is there are two of us : jehan marchand who sawed the boards and put up the framework for the theatre and all the woodwork , and i , who wrote the play .
my name is pierre gringoire .
the author of the cid could not have said pierre corneille ’ more proudly .
our readers may have observed that some time must have elapsed between the moment when jupiter went behind the curtain and that when the author of the new morality play so abruptly revealed himself to the simple admiration of gisquette and liénarde .
remarkably enough , all the crowd , which had been in such an uproar a few minutes before , was now quite docile as it waited , trusting in the actor ’ s word , which goes to prove the eternal truth , still a matter of daily experience in our modern theatres , that the best way to get the public to wait patiently is to assure them that the play is about to begin at once .
however , the student joannes was not asleep .
he suddenly cried amid the expectant calm which had followed the commotion , jupiter , our lady the virgin , you devil ’ s tumblers !
are you having us on ?
start now , or we ’ ll start up again !
that was all it needed .
from inside the scaffolding came the sound of music from instruments both treble and bass ; the curtain was raised ; four characters in motley and make-up emerged , climbed the steep ladder up to the stage , and once on the upper platform lined up before the public , to whom they bowed low ; at that the music stopped .
the mystery was about to begin .
the four characters , their bows amply rewarded by applause , embarked , amid a religious silence , on a prologue , which we gladly spare our readers .
besides , as still happens today , the public was much more interested in the costumes worn by the actors than in the part they were reciting ; and indeed this was only right .
all four wore robes half yellow and half white , differing only in the kind of material of which they were made ; the first was of gold and silver brocade , the second silk , the third wool , the fourth coarse linen .
the first character held a sword in his right hand , the second two golden keys , the third a pair of scales , the fourth a spade ; and to help those of sluggish intelligence who had failed to see clearly through such transparent attributes , one could read embroidered in big black letters : at the bottom of the brocade robe my name is nobility ; at the bottom of the silk robe my name is clergy ; at the bottom of the woollen robe my name is trade ; and at the bottom of the linen robe my name is husbandry .
the sex of the two male allegories was clearly indicated to every discerning spectator by their shorter robes and the cramignole ’ caps they wore , while the two female allegories , whose dresses were not so short , wore hoods .
it would have needed a lot of ill will not to grasp , through the poetry of the prologue , that husbandry was married to trade and clergy to nobility , and that the two happy couples were the joint owners of a magnificent golden dolphin ( dauphin ) which they intended to award only to the most beautiful of women .
so they were going round the world in a search and quest for this beauty , and having rejected successively the queen of golconda , the princess of trebizond , the grand khan of tartary ’ s daughter etc. , etc. , husbandry and trade , nobility and clergy had come to rest themselves on the marble table of the palais de justice , while they uttered before the worthy audience all the sentences and maxims which could at that time be dispensed in the faculty of arts in the examinations , sophisms , determinations , figures , and acts at which masters were capped for their degrees .
this was indeed all very fine .
however , in this crowd over which the four allegories competed in pouring out streams of metaphor , no ear was more attentive , no heart palpitated with more emotion , no eye was more distraught , no neck more intently craned than the eye , ear , heart , and neck of the author , the poet , the good pierre gringoire , who a moment before had not been able to resist the pleasure of telling two pretty girls his name .
he had returned to a position a few yards from them , behind his pillar , where he listened , watched , relished .
the warm applause which had greeted the beginning of his prologue still resounded in his inmost heart , and he was completely absorbed in the kind of ecstatic contemplation with which an author sees his ideas drop one by one from the actor ’ s lips into the silence of a vast audience .
worthy pierre gringoire !
it pains us to say so , but this initial ecstasy was very soon disturbed .
gringoire had scarcely raised to his lips this heady cup of joy and triumph when a dash of bitterness was mixed into it .
a ragged beggar , unable to ply his trade , lost as he was amidst the crowd , and who had no doubt failed to find sufficient compensation in his neighbours ’ pockets , had conceived the idea of perching in some conspicuous spot so as to attract attention and alms .
he had therefore , during the opening lines of the prologue , hoisted himself up by means of the pillars of the reserved tribune as far as the cornice running along the lower edge of its balustrade , and had sat down there , soliciting the attention and pity of the multitude with his rags and a hideous sore covering his right arm .
for the rest , he uttered not a word .
his silence allowed the prologue to proceed without hindrance , and no noticeable disorder would have occurred had not mischance caused the student joannes , high up on his pillar , to catch sight of the beggar and his grimaces .
helpless laughter overcame the young rascal , and unconcerned at interrupting the play and disturbing everyone ’ s concentration he cheerfully bawled : look at that fellow , faking sickness and asking for alms !
anyone who has ever tossed a stone into a pond full of frogs or fired a gun at a flock of birds can imagine the effect of such unseemly words when the attention of all was fixed elsewhere .
gringoire started as if from an electric shock .
the prologue was stopped short , and amid uproar all heads turned towards the beggar , who , far from being disconcerted , saw in this incident a good opportunity to reap a profit , and began with doleful look and half-closed eyes to call : charity , please !
well now , upon my soul , joannes went on , it ’ s clopin trouillefou .
hey there , my friend , was that sore on your leg so uncomfortable that you moved it to your arm ?
so saying , he threw , deft as a monkey , a small coin into the greasy hat that the beggar held out with his affected arm .
the beggar accepted the alms and the gibe without flinching , and went on crying mournfully : charity , please !
this episode had seriously distracted the audience , and a good number of spectators , with robin poussepain and all the clerks in the lead , merrily applauded the weird duet improvised in the middle of the prologue by the student with his strident voice and the beggar with his imperturbable chant .
gringoire was extremely put out .
recovering from his initial stupefaction , he cried with all his might to the four characters on stage : go on !
damn it all , go on !
without even deigning to spare a scornful glance at the two interrupters .
at that moment he felt someone tug at the hem of his surcoat ; he turned round in some annoyance , and had some difficulty in smiling . he had to , however .
it was gisquette-la-gencienne ’ s comely arm pushed through the balustrade which thus invited his attention .
monsieur , the girl said , will they be going on ?
certainly , gringoire answered , rather taken aback by the question .
in that case , messire , she went on , would you be kind enough to explain … ’
what they are going to say ?
no , said gisquette , what they ’ ve said so far .
gringoire jumped like someone touched on an open wound .
a plague on the stupid , dim-witted girl !
he said between clenched teeth .
from that moment on he dismissed gisquette from his mind .
meanwhile the actors had obeyed his injunction , and the public , seeing them speaking again , had begun again to listen , not without the loss of much beautiful poetry in the sort of soldered patch effected to join the two parts of the piece so abruptly cut off .
gringoire reflected on this bitterly in an undertone .
however , calm had gradually been restored , the student was quiet , the beggar was counting coins in his hat , and the play once more had the upper hand .
it was in fact a very fine piece of work , and in our view might well be turned to good account even today , subject to a few alterations .
the exposition , rather long and rather hollow , that is to say within the rules , was simple , and gringoire , in the candid sanctuary of his inmost heart , admired its clarity .
as may well be supposed , the four allegorical characters were rather weary after travelling three parts around the world without managing to dispose acceptably of their golden dolphin .
whereupon came a eulogy of the marvellous fish , with numerous delicate allusions to marguerite of flanders ’ young fiancè , then in dreary seclusion at amboise , scarcely suspecting that husbandry and clergy , nobility and trade had just gone round the world for his sake .
the aforesaid dolphin , then , was young , handsome , strong , and above all ( magnificent origin of all the royal virtues ! )
i declare this bold metaphor to be admirable , and maintain that natural history in the theatre , on a day of allegory and royal epithalamium , has no cause for offence in a dolphin being son of a lion .
it is precisely such rare , pindaric hybrids which prove real enthusiasm .
none the less , to give criticism its due as well , the poet could have developed this fine idea in something less than two hundred lines .
it is true that the mystery was meant to last from noon until four in the afternoon , according to monsieur the provost ’ s decree , and the actors had to say something .
besides , the audience were listening patiently .
suddenly , in the middle of a quarrel between mademoiselle trade and madame nobility , just as maître husbandry was pronouncing the wonderful line :
you never saw a more triumphant beast in all the woods ’
the door of the reserved tribune , which had so far remained inconveniently closed , was still more inconveniently opened , and the usher ’ s resounding voice abruptly announced : his eminence monseigneur the cardinal de bourbon .
monsieur le cardinal
the crash of all the great double petards on st john ’ s day , a volley from a score of arquebuses , the detonation of that famous serpentine in the billy tower , which killed seven burgundians in one go on sunday , 29 december 1465 during the siege of paris , the explosion of all the gunpowder in the magazine at the porte du temple , none of that could have split his eardrums more brutally at that solemn and dramatic moment than those few words from an usher ’ s mouth : his eminence monseigneur the cardinal de bourbon .
not that pierre gringoire felt any fear , or contempt , for the cardinal .
he was neither so weak nor so arrogant .
a genuine eclectic , as we should say today , gringoire was one of those spirits , at once elevated , firm , moderate , and calm , who always manage to preserve a balance ( stare in dimidio rerum ) full of reason and liberal philosophy , while paying cardinals their due .
wisdom , like a second ariadne , seems to have given this precious , unbroken line of philosophers a ball of thread which they have been unwinding since the world began through the labyrinth of human affairs .
they are to be found in every age , always the same , that is always in tune with the age .
setting aside our pierre gringoire , who would be their representative in the fifteenth century if we succeeded in restoring to him the renown he deserves , it was certainly their spirit which inspired father du breul in the sixteenth century when he wrote these sublimely simple words , worthy of any century : i am a parisian by nation and a parrhesian by speech , since parrhesia in greek means liberty of speech ; thus have i dealt even with my lords the cardinals , uncle and brother of my lord the prince de conti ; albeit respecting their greatness and without offending anyone in their entourage , no mean feat .
there was thus no dislike of the cardinal , nor scorn for his presence , in the disagreeable impression it made on pierre gringoire .
quite the contrary ; our poet had too much common sense and too threadbare a smock not to feel particularly keen that many of the allusions in his prologue , especially the glorification of the dolphin , son of the lion of france , should be picked up by so eminent an ear .
but self-interest is not the ruling factor in the noble nature of poets .
if we assume that the poet ’ s entity is represented by the number ten , it is certain that a chemist , analysing and , as rabelais puts it , pharmacopolizing it , would find it composed of one part of self-interest to nine of self-esteem .
now , at the moment when the door opened for the cardinal , gringoire ’ s nine parts of self-esteem , inflated and puffed up by the breath of popular admiration , were in a state of prodigious enlargement , causing that imperceptible molecule of self-interest which we identified a moment ago in the constitution of poets , to disappear as if smothered ; a precious ingredient , moreover a ballast of reality and humanity without which poets ’ feet would never touch the ground .
gringoire was enraptured at feeling , seeing , fingering , so to speak , a whole assembly ( of the baser sort , true , but what does that matter ? )
being stunned , petrified , as though asphyxiated by the immeasurable tirades continually erupting from every part of his epithalamium .
i can assert that he himself shared the general beatitude , and unlike la fontaine , who asked during a performance of his comedy the florentine : what bumpkin wrote that rhapsodic mess ?
gringoire would gladly have asked his neighbour : who wrote this masterpiece ?
you can now judge the effect on him of the cardinal ’ s abrupt and untimely arrival .
all his worst fears were only too well realized .
his eminence ’ s entrance had a shattering effect on the audience .
every head turned towards the tribune .
you could no longer hear yourself speak .
the unfortunate prologue was cut short for the second time .
the cardinal paused for a moment at the entrance to the tribune .
as he cast a somewhat indifferent eye round the audience , the uproar increased .
everyone wanted a better view of him .
each one strained to crane his head over his neighbour ’ s shoulder .
he was indeed an exalted personage , the sight of whom was worth any stage spectacle .
charles , cardinal de bourbon , archbishop count of lyons , primate of the gauls , was related both to louis xi , through his brother , pierre , lord of beaujeu , who had married the king ’ s daughter , and to charles the bold , through his mother , agnès of burgundy .
now the ruling feature , the characteristic and distinctive aspect of the primate of the gauls ’ character was his courtier ’ s instinct and his devotion to those in power .
one can imagine the countless problems which these double family connections had caused him , and all the temporal shoals through which his spiritual barque had had to tack , lest it be wrecked either on louis or on charles , that scylla and charybdis which had swallowed up the duke of nemours and the constable of saint-pol .
heaven be praised , he had survived the passage rather well , and arrived in rome without mishap .
but though he was in harbour , and precisely because he was in harbour , he never recalled without disquiet the diverse fortunes of his political life , so long filled with danger and toil .
thus he used to say that 1476 had been a black and white ’ year for him ; meaning that in one year he had lost his mother , the duchess of bourbonnais , and his cousin , the duke of burgundy , one bereavement consoling him for the other .
he enjoyed a cardinal ’ s life , liked getting merry on the royal wine of challuau [ chaillot ] , was not averse to richarde la garmoise and thomasse la saillarde , gave alms to pretty girls rather than to old women , and for all these reasons went down very well with the ordinary people of paris .
he went about always surrounded by a little court of bishops and abbots of noble lineage , gallant , bawdy , and good trenchermen if need be ; and more than once the pious ladies of saint-germain d ’ auxerre , passing in the evening beneath the brightly lit windows of the bourbon residence , had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had sung them vespers in the daytime chanting to the clink of glasses the bacchic motto of benedict xii , the pope who added a third crown to the tiara : bibamus papaliter ’ [ let us drink papally ] .
it was no doubt this well-deserved popularity which saved him , as he entered , from any hostile reception from the throng , which had been so disgruntled only a moment before and not at all in the mood to show respect for a cardinal on the very day when they were going to elect a pope .
but parisians rarely harbour a grudge ; and then , by having the performance begin on their own authority , the good citizens had scored over the cardinal , and that triumph was enough for them .
besides , monsieur le cardinal de bourbon was a fine figure of a man , he had a fine red robe and wore it very well ; in other words , he had all the women on his side , and consequently the better part of the audience .
it would certainly be unfair and in poor taste to boo a cardinal for keeping everyone waiting at the show , when he is a fine-looking man and wears his red robe so well .
he came in then , greeted the audience with the hereditary smile which the great bestow on the people , and advanced with measured step towards his scarlet armchair , looking as though his thoughts were elsewhere .
his train , what would today be called his staff of bishops and abbots , poured on to the tribune in his wake , exciting increased tumult and curiosity among the groundlings .
everyone was trying to point them out to his neighbour , put a name to them , be acquainted with at least one of them ; for one it was the lord bishop of marseilles , alaudet , if memory serves aright ; another the dean of saint-denis ; another , robert de lespinasse , abbot of saint-germain-des-prés , libertine brother of one of louis xi ’ s mistresses : all this with numerous errors and cacophony .
as for the students , they were swearing .
it was their day , their feast of fools , their saturnalia , annual orgy of law clerks and students .
on that day their entitlement to the vilest behaviour was something sacred .
and then there were some wild gossips in the crowd , simone quatre-livres , agnès la gadine , robine piédebou .
couldn ’ t they at least be left to swear in peace and utter the odd profanity on such a fine day , in the excellent company of churchmen and harlots ?
so they went to it with a will ; and amid the general clamour came a fearful chorus of blasphemies and obscenities from all these unbridled tongues of clerks and students , restrained for the rest of the year by fear of saint louis ’ s branding irons on their tongues .
poor saint louis , how they derided him in his own palais de justice !
each of them had marked out a target among those who had just arrived on the tribune , a black , or grey , or white , or violet cassock .
as for joannes frollo de molendino , as an archdeacon ’ s brother it was on the red cassock that he launched his bold assault , and he sang at the top of his voice , staring shamelessly at the cardinal : cappa repleta mero ’ [ a cope filled with wine ] .
all these details , here exposed for the reader ’ s edification , were so submerged in the general tumult as to be lost before they reached the reserved tribune .
besides , the cardinal would not have been much upset , for the licence on that day was quite taken for granted .
in any case , as his preoccupied expression showed , he had another cause for concern , which followed hard on his heels and came on to the tribune almost at the same time as he did .
not that he was a profound politician , fussing about the possible consequences of the marriage of madame his cousin , marguerite of burgundy , to monsieur his cousin , charles , dauphin of vienne ; how long the understanding patched up between the duke of austria and the king of france would last , how the king of england would take this slight to his daughter , that worried him very little , and every evening he paid tribute to wine from the royal vineyard at chaillot without ever suspecting that a few flasks of that same wine ( slightly revised and amended , it is true , by the physician coictier ) cordially presented to edward iv by louis xi would one fine morning rid louis xi of edward iv .
the most honoured embassy of the duke of austria ’ brought the cardinal no such worries , but bothered him in another way .
it was indeed a bit hard , as we have already mentioned on the second page of this book , that he , charles de bourbon , should be obliged to entertain and welcome mere burghers : he , a cardinal , they échevins [ sheriffs ] ; he , a frenchman , fond of the table , they flemish beer-swillers ; and in public at that .
this was , to be sure , one of the most irksome smiles he had ever had to assume for the sake of the king ’ s good pleasure .
he turned towards the door , then , with the utmost graciousness ( so well did he apply himself ) , when the usher resoundingly announced : messieurs the envoys of monsieur the duke of austria .
at that there filed in , two by two , with a gravity strongly contrasting with the exuberant ecclesiastical suite of charles de bourbon , maximilian of austria ’ s ambassadors , led by the reverend father in god jehan , abbot of saint-bertin , chancellor of the golden fleece , and jacques de goy , sieur dauby , high bailiff of ghent .
a profound silence fell on the assembly , with some laughter , though muffled so that they could listen to all the ludicrous names and civic titles that each individual transmitted imperturbably to the usher , who then tossed names and titles in any order and much mangled down to the crowd .
there was maître loys roelof , échevin of the town of louvain ; messire clays d ’ étuelde , échevin of brussels ; messire paul de baeust , sieur de voirmizelle , presiding magistrate of flanders ; maître jehan coleghens , burgomaster of antwerp ; maître george de la moere , first échevin of the kuere [ court ] of ghent ; maître gheldof van der hage , first échevin of the parchons of the aforesaid town ; and the sieur de bier-becque , and jehan pinnock , and jehan dymaerzelle , etc. , etc. , etc .
: bailiffs , échevins , burgomasters ; burgomasters , échevins , bailiffs ; all stiff , formal , starchy in their best velvet and damask , wearing cramignole caps of black velvet with huge tassels of cyprus gold thread ; good flemish heads after all , dignified , severe features belonging to the same family as that which rembrandt brings out so powerfully and gravely against the black background of the night watch ’ ; personages every one of whom bore graven on his brow that maximilian of austria had been right , as his manifesto ran : to have full confidence in their prudence , valour , experience , loyalty , and integrity ’ .
with one exception , however .
this was a shrewd , intelligent , cunning face , a sort of cross between a monkey and a diplomat , towards which the cardinal advanced three paces and bowed low , and yet whose name was just guillaume rym , counsellor and pensionary of the town of ghent .
few then knew what manner of man was guillaume rym .
a rare genius , who in time of revolution would have made a dazzling appearance on the surface of events , but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to subterranean intrigue and living in the saps ’ , as the due de saint-simon puts it .
for the rest , he was appreciated by the chief sapper ’ of europe , he was familiarly involved in louis xi ’ s machinations , and often lent a hand with the king ’ s secret operations .
all of which was quite unknown to this crowd , which marvelled at the courtesies paid by the cardinal to this weedy-looking flemish bailiff .
maître jacques coppenole
while the pensionary of ghent and his eminence were exchanging low bows and a few words in an even lower voice , a tall man with a broad face and powerful shoulders came up so that he entered abreast with guillaume rym , looking like a mastiff beside a fox .
his felt bycocket and leather jerkin stood out conspicuously amid the silk and velvet around him .
assuming that he was some groom who had lost his way , the usher stopped him .
hey , my friend !
the man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside .
what does this fellow think he ’ s doing ?
he roared in a voice which drew the attention of the entire hall to this strange altercation .
can ’ t you see that i am one of them ?
asked the usher .
hosier , at the sign of the three little chains at ghent .
the usher recoiled .
announcing échevins and burgomasters was one thing , but a hosier … that was hard .
the cardinal was in torment .
all the people were looking and listening .
for two days now his eminence had been striving to lick these flemish bears into rather better shape for public appearances , and this piece of bad manners went too far .
meanwhile guillaume rym , with his crafty smile , went up to the usher :
announce maître jacques coppenole , clerk to the échevins of the town of ghent , he said in a very low whisper .
usher , the cardinal said aloud , announce maître jacques coppenole , clerk to the échevins of the illustrious town of ghent .
that was a mistake .
guillaume rym left to himself could have evaded the difficulty , but coppenole had heard the cardinal .
do you hear , usher ?
no more , and no less .
by the rood !
hosier is fine enough !
my lord archduke has gone looking more than once for his gauntlet [ ghent-let ] in my hose .
in paris a pun is picked up at once , and thus always applauded .
it should be added that coppenole was a man of the people , and the audience around him was of the people .
so communication between him and them had been rapid , electric , and , so to speak , on an equal footing .
the flemish hosier ’ s proud outburst , by humiliating the courtiers , had stirred up in all those plebeian souls a certain sense of dignity , in the fifteenth century as yet vague and undefined .
this hosier , who had just stood up to monsieur le cardinal , was their equal—a comforting thought indeed for poor devils accustomed to show respect and obedience to the servants of the bailiff of the abbot of sainte-geneviève , the cardinal ’ s train-bearer .
coppenole bowed proudly to his eminence , who bowed back to this all-powerful burgher so feared by louis xi .
then , while guillaume rym , a wise and crafty man ’ as philippe de commines puts it , followed both of them with a mocking and superior smile , they each went to their place , the cardinal quite put out and pensive , coppenole calm and haughty , reflecting no doubt that after all his title of hosier was as good as any other , and mary of burgundy , mother of the marguerite whom coppenole was marrying off that day , would have feared him less as a cardinal than as a hosier : for no cardinal would have stirred up the people of ghent against the favourites of charles the bold ’ s daughter ; no cardinal would have steeled the crowd with a word against her tears and entreaties when the lady of flanders came to the very foot of the scaffold to beg her people for mercy on their behalf ; while the hosier had only to lift his leather elbow to make both your heads roll , my most illustrious lords guy d ’ hymbercourt and chancellor guillaume hugonet !
however , that was not yet the end of it for the poor cardinal and he had to drain to the dregs the cup of finding himself in such bad company .
the reader has perhaps not forgotten the shameless beggar who had come to cling to the fringes of the cardinal ’ s tribune once the prologue began .
the arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means made him let go , and while prelates and ambassadors packed into the stalls of the tribune , as tightly as real flemish herrings in a barrel , he had made himself comfortable , boldly crossing his legs on the architrave .
this exceptional piece of insolence had at first gone quite unnoticed , since the attention of all was directed elsewhere .
he , for his part , noticed nothing in the hall ; he kept nodding his head , as unconcerned as any neapolitan , repeating from time to time , amid the general noise , as if from mechanical habit : charity , please !
and indeed he was probably the only person out of all those present who had not deigned to turn his head towards the altercation between coppenole and the usher .
now , as luck would have it , the master hosier from ghent , with whom the people already felt such sympathy and on whom all eyes were fixed , came to sit down in the front row of the tribune , precisely above the beggar ; they were not a little amazed to see the flemish ambassador inspect the rascal perched beneath him and then give him a friendly tap on his ragged shoulder .
the beggar turned round ; surprise , recognition , broad smiles on the two faces , etc .
the novelty of this unusual scene aroused a wave of such wild merriment in the hall that the cardinal was soon aware of it ; he half leaned forward , but from the point at which he was sitting he had only the most imperfect view of trouillefou ’ s disreputable mantle and quite naturally assumed that the beggar was asking for alms ; outraged at such a liberty he cried : monsieur the bailiff of the palais , have this rascal thrown into the river .
monseigneur le cardinal , coppenole said without loosing coppenole ’ s hand , he ’ s a friend of mine .
cried the audience .
from that moment on maître coppenole enjoyed in paris , as he did in ghent , high esteem with the people ; for men of such stature do so , says philippe de commines , when they are thus unruly .
the cardinal bit his lip .
he leaned over to his neighbour , the abbot of sainte-geneviève , and said in an undertone : monsieur the archduke has sent us a fine lot of ambassadors to herald madame marguerite !
your eminence , the abbot replied , is wasting his courtesies on these flemish snouts .
margaritas ante porcos [ pearls before swine ] .
say rather , answered the cardinal with a smile : porcos ante margaritam [ swine before marguerite/pearl ] .
the whole of this little court swooned in their cassocks with ecstasy over this pun .
the cardinal ’ s spirits rose a little ; he had now got even with coppenole , and also won applause for his pun .
now we should like permission from those of our readers with the power to generalize an image or idea , as the modern style puts it , to ask whether they have a clear picture of the scene presented by the vast parallelogram of the great hall of the palais at the moment on which our attention is focused .
in the middle of the hall , set up against the western wall , a large and magnificent tribune of gold brocade , which a procession of solemn personages , announced in turn by the strident voice of an usher , is entering through a small gothic doorway .
in the front rows numerous venerable figures are already seated , in their ermine , velvet , and scarlet hoods .
around the tribune , where quiet and dignity prevail , below , in front , everywhere , a great crowd and a great buzz of noise .
from the crowd countless eyes gaze at every face on the tribune , countless comments are whispered over every name .
the spectacle is indeed a curious one , well worthy of the spectators ’ attention .
but over there , at the far end , whatever can that be , that sort of trestle with four motley puppets on top and four more beneath ?
whoever can that be , standing beside the trestle with his black smock and pale face ?
dear reader , it is pierre gringoire and his prologue .
we had all completely forgotten him .
which is exactly what he had feared .
from the moment the cardinal had made his entrance gringoire had been constantly busy trying to save his prologue .
then , seeing that no one was listening , he had stopped them , and during the quarter-hour or so that the interruption lasted , he had been ceaselessly tapping his foot , jumping about , hailing gisquette and liénarde , encouraging his neighbours to have the prologue resumed ; all in vain .
no one could be diverted from the cardinal , the embassy , and the tribune , the single centre of this immense circle of visual radii .
it also seems likely , and we say so with regret , that the audience was beginning to be slightly bored with the prologue just as his eminence came in to divert attention so drastically from it .
after all , on the tribune as on the marble table , it was all the same spectacle : the conflict of husbandry and clergy , of nobility and trade .
and many people simply preferred to see them living , breathing , moving , jostling , in flesh and blood , in this flemish embassy , this episcopal court , in the cardinal ’ s robes , in coppenole ’ s jerkin , rather than painted and dressed up , speaking in verse and , so to speak , stuffed like dummies beneath the yellow and white tunics in which gringoire had rigged them up .
however , when our poet saw that calm had been partially restored , he conceived a stratagem which might have saved the day .
monsieur , he said , turning to one of his neighbours , a stout , patient-looking worthy , supposing they began again ?
said the neighbour .
why , the mystery , said gringoire .
just as you like , replied the neighbour .
this half-approval was enough for gringoire , and taking matters into his own hands he began crying out , merging as much as possible into the crowd : start the mystery again !
devil take it , said joannes de molendino , what are they chanting there , down at the end ?
( for gringoire was making enough noise for four people . )
what about it , comrades ?
they want to start it up again .
that ’ s not right .
cried all the students .
down with the mystery !
down with it !
but gringoire only tried harder and cried still more loudly : start again !
all this clamour attracted the cardinal ’ s attention .
monsieur the bailiff of the palais , he said to a tall , dark man standing near him .
the bailiff of the palais was a kind of amphibious magistrate , a sort of bat in the judicial order , a cross between rat and bird , judge and soldier .
he approached his eminence , very much afraid of his displeasure , and stammered out an explanation for the people ’ s unseemly behaviour ; noon had arrived before his eminence , and the players had been forced to begin without waiting for his eminence .
the cardinal burst out laughing .
upon my soul , the rector of the university should have done the same .
what say you , maître guillaume rym ?
monseigneur , guillaume rym replied , let ’ s be content with having been let off half the comedy .
there ’ s that much at least to our credit .
can these rogues go on with their farce ?
asked the bailiff .
go on , go on , said the cardinal , it ’ s all the same to me .
i ’ ll be reading my breviary the while .
the bailiff came forward to the edge of the tribune , silenced them with a gesture and cried : citizens , villeins , inhabitants , to satisfy those who want it to start again and those who want it done with , his eminence orders the play to continue .
both parties had to put up with that .
however author and public for long afterwards felt resentment towards the cardinal .
the characters on the stage resumed their commentary , and gringoire hoped that at least the remainder of his text would be heard .
this hope soon went the way of his other illusions ; silence in the audience had indeed been more or less restored , but gringoire had failed to notice that at the moment when the cardinal gave the order to continue , the tribune was far from full , and after the flemish envoys had come other persons belonging to the procession , whose names and titles , intermittently projected by the usher ’ s cry amid the continuing dialogue , was wreaking considerable havoc with it .
try indeed to imagine , in the middle of a theatrical performance , a yelping usher interjecting between two rhymes , and often between two hemistichs , such parentheses as these : maître jacques charmolue , the king ’ s attorney in the ecclesiastical court ! —jehan de harlay , esquire , keeper of the office of chevalier of the night watch of the town of paris ! —messire galiot de genoilhac , knight , seigneur de brussac , master of the king ’ s artillery ! —maître dreux-raguier , inspector of waters and forests of our lord the king for the île-de-france , champagne , and brie ! —messire louis de graville , knight , counsellor , and chamberlain to the king , admiral of france , guardian of the forest of vincennes ! —maître denis le mercier , keeper of the hospital for the blind of paris ! —etc. , etc .
it was becoming intolerable .
this strange accompaniment , which made it hard to follow the play , made gringoire all the more indignant as he could not disguise from himself the fact that it was becoming more interesting all the time and the only thing wrong with his work was that no one was listening to it .
it would indeed be hard to imagine a more ingenious and dramatic construction .
the four characters of the prologue were bemoaning their insoluble predicament , when venus in person , vera incessu patuit dea [ a true goddess was evident in her step ] appeared before them , wearing a fine cotehardie emblazoned with the ship of the town arms of paris .
she came herself to claim the dolphin promised to the most beautiful of women .
jupiter , whose thunder could be heard rumbling from the dressing room , supported her , and the goddess was about to win the prize , that is , in plain terms , to marry monsieur le dauphin , when a little girl , dressed in white damask and holding in her hand a marguerite daisy ( a transparent personification of the princess of flanders ) had come to contend with venus .
after some debate , venus , marguerite , and those in the wings had agreed to abide by the judgement of the holy virgin .
there was another fine part , that of dom pedro , king of mesopotamia .
they had all climbed the ladder to come up on stage .
none of these beauties had been felt or understood .
at the cardinal ’ s entrance it seemed as though a magic , invisible thread had suddenly drawn every eye from the marble table to the tribune , from the southern end of the hall to its western side .
every eye remained riveted there , and the new arrivals , their cursed names , their faces , and their costumes constituted a continual distraction .
it was heart-rending .
except for gisquette and liénarde , who turned away from time to time when gringoire pulled at their sleeves , except for the stout , patient neighbour , no one was facing the poor abandoned morality .
all gringoire could see were faces in profile .
how bitterly he saw the piecemeal collapse of his whole edifice of fame and poetry !
and just to think that these people had been on the point of rebellion against monsieur the bailiff , so impatient were they to hear his work !
now that they had it , no one cared about it .
the same performance which had begun with such unanimous applause !
eternal ebb and flow of popular favour !
to think that they had come close to hanging the bailiff ’ s sergeants !
what would he not have given to return to that hour of sweetness !
the usher ’ s brutal monologue , however , came to an end .
but what should happen but that maître coppenole , the hosier , suddenly stands up , and gringoire hears him deliver , amid the attention of all , this abominable harangue :
messieurs , burghers and squires of paris , i don ’ t know , by the rood !
what we are doing here .
i can quite clearly see over there , in that corner , on that trestle , some people who look as if they want a fight .
i don ’ t know if that ’ s what you call a mystery , but it ’ s not much fun .
for quarter of an hour i ’ ve been waiting for the first blow , nothing happens .
they should have brought over some fighters from london or rotterdam ; and then , my goodness !
there would have been punches you could hear out in the street !
they ought at least to give us a morris dance or some other mummery !
they promised us a feast of fools , with the election of a pope .
we have our pope of fools in ghent too , and we don ’ t lag behind anyone when it comes to that , by the rood !
the one who pulls the ugliest face , by general acclamation , is elected pope .
would you like us to make your pope as we do at home ?
at least it wouldn ’ t be as dull as listening to those windbags .
if they want to come and pull a face at the hole they ’ ll be in the competition .
what do you say , messieurs the burghers ?
there ’ s a good enough choice of gargoyles of both sexes for us to have a good flemish laugh , and enough ugly mugs to hope for a splendid grimace .
gringoire would have liked to reply .
besides , the popular hosier ’ s motion was greeted with such enthusiasm by these burghers , who felt flattered to be addressed as squires , that resistance was pointless .
there was nothing for it but to go along with the torrent .
gringoire buried his face in his hands , not being fortunate enough to have a cloak to hide his head like timanthes ’ agamemnon .
in less than no time everything was ready for carrying out coppenole ’ s idea .
townsfolk , students , and law clerks had set to work .
the small chapel facing the marble table was chosen as the scene for the face-pulling .
where glass had been broken from the pretty rose-window it had left open a stone circle through which , it was agreed , the contestants would stick their heads .
all they had to do to reach it was to clamber up a couple of barrels , which had been brought from somewhere and precariously balanced one on top of the other .
it was laid down that every candidate , man or woman ( for a female pope might be chosen ) should preserve the impression of their grimace unspoiled and intact by covering their faces and staying out of sight in the chapel until it was time for them to make their appearance .
in a moment the chapel was full of contestants and the door was closed behind them .
from his place on the tribune coppenole organized , directed , and arranged everything .
during the commotion the cardinal , no less put out than gringoire , had taken himself off with all his suite on the pretext of having business and vespers to attend to , without the crowd , which had been so excited by his arrival , taking the slightest notice of his departure .
guillaume rym was the only one to notice his eminence put to flight .
the attention of the people , like the sun , pursued its revolution ; starting at one end of the hall , after pausing for a time in the middle , it was now at the other end .
the marble table , the brocaded tribune had had their moment ; it was now the turn of louis xi ’ s chapel .
from now on the field was clear for unbridled folly .
only the flemings and the rabble remained .
the face-pulling began .
the first face to appear at the hole , with eyelids turned inside out with rouge , mouth agape like a monster ’ s jaws , and brows all wrinkled like our empire cavalry boots , set off such peals of uncontrollable laughter that homer would have taken all these villeins for gods .
however , the great hall was anything but olympus , as gringoire ’ s poor jupiter knew better than anyone .
a second , and a third ugly face followed , then another and yet another , and each time there was renewed laughter and delighted stamping of feet .
the spectacle provoked a special kind of giddy elation , it had a certain power of intoxication and fascination , of which it would be hard to convey any idea to a modern reader and modern drawing-room society .
imagine a series of faces successively presenting every geometrical shape , from the triangle to the trapezium , from the cone to the polyhedron—every human expression , from anger to lust—every age of man , from the wrinkles of the new-born baby to the wrinkles of the dying old crone ; every religious phantasmagoria , from faunus to beelzebub ; every animal profile , from jaw to beak , from snout to muzzle .
picture all the grotesque heads carved on the pont-neuf , those nightmares turned to stone under the hand of germain pilon , taking on life and breath , and coming one by one to stare at you with burning eyes ; all the masks from the venice carnival passing one after the other before your spyglass ; in a word , a human kaleidoscope .
the orgy was becoming more and more flemish .
teniers could give only a very imperfect idea of it .
imagine salvator rosa ’ s battle picture turned into bacchanalia .
there were no more students , ambassadors , burghers , men , women ; no more clopin trouillefou , gilles lecornu , marie quatre-livres , robin poussepain .
all was eclipsed in the common licence .
the great hall was now just a vast furnace of shameless merriment , where every mouth was a shout , every eye a sparkle , every face a grimace , every individual a posture .
the strange faces which came one after another to grind their teeth at the rose-window were so many brands thrown on the fire .
just look at that face !
that one ’ s no good .
guillemette maugerepuis , just look at that bull ’ s muzzle , it ’ s got everything but horns .
it can ’ t be your husband , then .
by the pope ’ s belly !
what sort of grimace is that ?
that ’ s cheating .
you may only show your face .
that damned perrette callebotte !
she ’ s quite capable of that .
i ’ m choking !
there ’ s one can ’ t get his ears through !
we must , however , give our friend jehan his due .
amid all this witches ’ sabbath he could still be seen up on his pillar , like a cabin boy in the crow ’ s nest .
he was throwing himself about in an incredible frenzy .
his mouth was wide open , and from it emerged a cry that no one could hear , not that it was lost in the general clamour , intense though that was , but because it had surely gone to the limit of high-pitched audible sounds , the twelve thousand vibrations of sauveur or the eight thousand of biot .
as for gringoire , once his initial depression had passed , he had recovered his composure .
he had braced himself against adversity .
then striding round in front of the marble table he had a notion to go in his turn and appear at the chapel window , if only for the pleasure of pulling faces at these ungrateful people .
the power of poetry over the people is great ; i ’ ll bring them back .
we ’ ll see which will win , face-pulling or the literary arts .
he was the only spectator of his play left .
it was much worse than it had been shortly before .
now all he could see was backs .
i am mistaken .
the patient , stout man , whom he had already consulted at a critical moment , still faced the stage .
as for gisquette and liénarde , they had long since deserted .
gringoire was deeply moved by the loyalty of his sole spectator .
he went up and spoke to him , gently shaking him by the arm ; for the good man was leaning on the balustrade in a light doze .
monsieur , said gringoire , thank you .
monsieur , the stout man answered with a yawn , what for ?
i can see what ’ s bothering you , the poet went on ; with all this noise you can ’ t hear properly .
but don ’ t worry , your name will go down to posterity .
what is your name , if you please ?
renault château , keeper of the seal at the châtelet , in paris , at your service .
monsieur , you are the only representative of the muses here , said gringoire .
you are too kind , monsieur , answered the keeper of the seal at the châtelet .
you are the only one to have given the play a proper hearing .
what do you think of it ?
the stout magistrate answered , pretty lively , to be sure .
gringoire had to be content with this word of praise , for thunderous applause , accompanied by a tremendous burst of cheering , cut short their conversation .
the pope of fools had been elected .
cried people on every side .
it was indeed a quite marvellous grimace that was just then beaming through the hole in the rose-window .
after all the faces , pentagonal , hexagonal , and irregular , which had succeeded each other at the window without ever achieving the grotesque ideal that imaginations fevered by the orgy had composed , it took nothing less to carry their vote than the sublime grimace which had just dazzled the assembly .
maître coppenole himself applauded ; and clopin trouillefou , who had been a competitor , and goodness knows the intense degree of ugliness his face could attain , confessed himself beaten .
we shall not attempt to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose , that horseshoe mouth , that tiny left eye obscured by a shaggy red eyebrow , while the right eye lay completely hidden beneath an enormous wart .
the acclamation was unanimous .
from it they brought in triumph the blessed pope of fools .
but it was then that surprise and wonder reached their peak .
or rather his whole person was grimace .
a large head bristling with red hair ; between his shoulders an enormous hump , the effects of which were also visible in front ; an assemblage of thighs and legs so strangely distorted that they touched only at the knees and , from the front , looked like two sickle blades joined at the handle ; big feet , monstrous hands ; and with all that deformity a certain air of fearsome energy , agility , and courage ; a strange exception to the eternal rule which says that strength , like beauty , results from harmony .
such was the pope whom the fools had just given themselves .
he looked like a giant , broken into pieces and then badly mended .
when this kind of cyclops appeared at the entrance to the chapel , motionless , squat , and almost as broad as he was tall , squared by the base ’ as a great man put it , his surcoat , half red , half violet , sprinkled with silver bells , and above all his quite perfect ugliness , at once enabled the people to recognize him , and they cried with one voice :
it ’ s quasimodo , the bell-ringer !
it ’ s quasimodo the hunchback of notre-dame !
one-eyed quasimodo !
bandy-legged quasimodo !
the poor devil clearly had a choice of nicknames .
watch out , any pregnant women !
shouted the students .
or any who want to be , joannes put in .
the women were indeed hiding their faces .
the ugly monkey , said one .
as wicked as he ’ s ugly , put in another .
he is the devil , added a third .
i ’ m unlucky enough to live near notre-dame ; all night long i hear him prowling about in the guttering .
with the cats .
he ’ s always up on our roofs .
he casts spells on us down the chimney .
the other evening he came to make faces at me through my attic window .
i thought it was some man .
i was so scared !
i ’ m sure he goes to the witches ’ sabbath .
once he left a broomstick on my roof-leads .
what a horrid-looking hunchback !
the evil soul !
the men , on the contrary , were delighted and applauded .
quasimodo , object of the uproar , still stood at the chapel door , sombre and serious , letting them admire him .
a student , robin poussepain , i think , went up to laugh in his face , but came too near .
quasimodo contented himself with seizing him round the waist and hurling him ten yards into the crowd .
maître coppenole , struck with wonder , approached him .
holy father , you are the most beautifully ugly thing i ’ ve ever seen in my life .
you deserve to be pope in rome as well as paris .
so saying he cheerfully clapped him on the shoulder .
quasimodo did not stir .
coppenole went on .
quasimodo made no reply .
said the hosier ; are you deaf ?
he was indeed deaf .
however , he was beginning to get tired of coppenole ’ s behaviour , and suddenly turned on him , grinding his teeth so fearfully that the flemish giant retreated , like a bulldog before a cat .
then terror and respect cleared round this strange personage a circle at least fifteen geometrical paces in radius .
an old woman explained to maître coppenole that quasimodo was deaf .
said the hosier with his coarse flemish laugh .
he ’ s the perfect pope !
i know who he is , cried jehan , who had finally come down from his capital for a closer look at quasimodo ; he ’ s my brother the archdeacon ’ s bell-ringer .
devil of a man !
said robin poussepain , still aching and bruised all over from his fall .
he appears : he ’ s a hunchback .
he walks : he ’ s bandy-legged .
he looks at you : he ’ s one-eyed .
you speak to him : he ’ s deaf .
well then , what ’ s his tongue for , this polyphemus ?
he speaks when he wants to , said the old woman .
he ’ s not dumb .
and he has one eye too many , added robin poussepain .
a man with one eye is more imperfect than a completely blind one .
he knows what he hasn ’ t got .
meanwhile all the beggars , all the lackeys , all the cutpurses had joined the students and gone in procession to fetch from the lawyers ’ wardrobe the pasteboard tiara and mock chimer kept for the pope of fools .
quasimodo let them robe him without a flicker of protest and with a kind of proud docility .
then they seated him on a gaudy litter .
twelve officers of the confraternity of fools lifted him on to their shoulders ; and a kind of bitter , contemptuous pleasure spread over the cyclops ’ sullen face as he saw beneath his misshapen feet the heads of handsome , straight-limbed , well-made men .
then the yelling , ragged procession moved off on the traditional inner circuit of the galleries of the palais before parading through the streets and crossroads .
we are delighted to be able to inform our readers that during the whole of this scene gringoire and his play had stood fast .
his actors , with him spurring them on , had not left off declaiming his comedy , and he had not left off listening .
he had come to terms with the din , and was determined to go on to the end , not abandoning the hope of regaining the people ’ s attention .
this glimmer of hope revived when he saw quasimodo , coppenole , and the deafening procession escorting the pope of fools noisily leave the hall .
the crowd rushed eagerly after them .
good , he thought , there go all the trouble-makers .
unfortunately all the trouble-makers were all the public .
in a twinkling the great hall was empty .
some spectators did in fact still remain , some scattered about , others grouped round the pillars , women , old folk , and children , who had had their fill of uproar and commotion .
a few students had stayed astride the window ledges and were looking out on to the place .
well , thought gringoire , there are still enough left to hear the end of my mystery .
there are only a few , but it is a superior kind of audience , an educated audience .
after a moment a symphony , intended to produce a striking effect as the holy virgin arrived , failed to materialize .
gringoire realized that his band had been taken off by the procession of the pope of fools .
carry on , he said stoically .
he approached a group of citizens who , he thought , were discussing his play .
he caught the following scrap of conversation :
you know , maître cheneteau , the hôtel de navarre , which used to belong to monsieur de nemours ?
yes , opposite the chapel of braque .
well , the tax people have just let it to guillaume alixandre , the decorator , for 6 livres 8 sous a year .
how rents are going up !
gringoire said to himself with a sigh , the others are listening .
one of the young rascals on the window suddenly cried , la esmeralda !
la esmeralda ’ s in the place !
these words had a magical effect .
all those left in the hall rushed to the windows , climbing up the walls to see , and repeated : la esmeralda !
at the same time loud applause could be heard from outside .
what does that mean—la esmeralda ?
said gringoire , clasping his hands in despair .
oh goodness , it seems to be the turn of the windows now .
he turned round towards the marble table , and saw that the performance had been interrupted .
this was just the moment when jupiter was meant to appear with his thunderbolt .
but jupiter stood motionless below the stage .
michel giborne , the poet cried angrily , what are you doing there ?
is that your part ?
said jupiter , one of the students has just taken the ladder .
it was only too true .
all communication had been severed between his dramatic knot and its resolution .
and why did he take the ladder ?
to go and see la esmeralda , jupiter pathetically replied .
he said : well now , here ’ s a ladder no one is using !
and took it .
this was the final blow .
gringoire accepted it with resignation .
devil take you !
he said to the actors ; and if i get paid you will be .
then he retreated , head bowed , but the last to go , like a general who has fought well .
and as he went down the winding stairs of the palais he grumbled between his teeth : these parisians are a fine lot of asses and boors ; they come to see a mystery play , and don ’ t listen to a word !
they took an interest in everyone , clopin trouillefou , the cardinal , coppenole , quasimodo , the devil !
but not a bit of interest in our lady the virgin mary .
if i ’ d known , i ’ d have given you virgin marys , you nosy idlers !
as for me , i come expecting to see faces and see nothing but backs !
to be a poet and have as much success as an apothecary !
it ’ s true homerus went round the greek villages begging , and naso died in exile among the muscovites .
but may the devil flay me if i understand what they mean with their esmeralda !
what sort of word is that anyhow ?
from charybdis to scylla
night comes early in january .
the streets were already dark when gringoire left the palais .
he was pleased that night had fallen ; he was longing to find some dark lonely alley where he could ponder at leisure and where the philosopher could apply first aid to the wound suffered by the poet .
philosophy was in any case his only refuge , for he did not know where he could stay .
after the shattering fiasco of his first attempt at drama he did not dare go back to his previous lodgings in the rue grenier-sur-l ’ eau , opposite the port-au-foin , having counted on what monsieur the provost was to give him for the epithalamium to pay maître guillaume doulx-sire , who farmed the tax on cloven-footed beasts in paris , the six months ’ rent he owed , that is , 12 sols parisis ; twelve times more than the value of all his worldly possessions , including his breeches , shirt , and bycocket hat .
after a moment ’ s reflection , while he took temporary shelter beneath the small wicket-gate of the treasurer of the sainte-chapelle ’ s prison , as to where he might decide to spend the night , with all the cobblestones in paris to choose from , he remembered having noticed the week before , in the rue de la savaterie , in front of a parliamentary counsellor ’ s door , a mounting block for mule riders , which , he had thought , might , on occasion , provide an excellent pillow for a beggar or a poet .
he thanked providence for sending him such a good idea , but as he was about to cross the place du palais to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city , through which wind all those serpentine old sisters , the rues de la barillerie , de la vieille-draperie , de la savaterie , de la juiverie etc. , still standing today with their nine-storey houses , he saw the pope of fools ’ procession also leaving the palais and rushing across his path , with loud shouts , bright torchlight , and his , gringoire ’ s , band .
the sight opened up again the lacerating injuries inflicted on his self-esteem : he fled .
in the bitterness of his dramatic misadventures , anything that reminded him of the day ’ s celebration soured him and made his wound bleed again .
he intended to take the pont saint-michel ; children were running about on the bridge with squibs and rockets .
a plague on all fireworks !
said gringoire and fell back on the pont-au-change .
on the houses at the approach to the bridge had been hung three banners representing the king , the dauphin and marguerite of flanders , and six smaller banners portraying the duke of austria , the cardinal de bourbon , monsieur de beaujeu , madame jeanne de france , monsieur the bastard of bourbon , and someone or other besides ; all lit up by torches .
the crowd was full of admiration .
he ’ s a lucky painter , that jehan fourbault !
said gringoire with a deep sigh , and turned his back on the banners , large and small .
a street opened in front of him ; he found it so dark and deserted that he hoped to escape there from all the echoes and illuminations of the festival .
after a moment or two he stubbed his foot on an obstacle ; he stumbled and fell .
it was the may bundle which the law clerks had put down that morning at the door of a parliamentary president in honour of the feast day .
he picked himself up and reached the water ’ s edge .
leaving behind him the tournelle civile and the tour criminelle , and following the great wall of the king ’ s gardens along the unpaved river bank where the mud came up to his ankles , he came to the westernmost tip of the city , and stayed for a while looking at the little island of the cow-ferryman , passeur-aux-vaches , which has since disappeared beneath the bronze horse and the pont-neuf .
the little island appeared in the shadows like a dark mass on the far side of the pale strip of water separating him from it .
one could just make out by the beams of a little light a sort of hut , shaped like a beehive , where the ferryman sheltered at night .
thought gringoire : you don ’ t have dreams of glory and you don ’ t write epithalamia !
what do kings ’ weddings and duchesses of burgundy matter to you !
and i , a poet , am booed , and stand shivering with cold , and owe 12 sous , and the soles of my shoes have worn so thin that they are transparent enough to serve as glass for your lantern .
thank you , cow-ferryman , your cabin is a restful sight and makes me forget paris !
he was woken out of his almost lyrical ecstasy by a great double petard suddenly exploding from the blessed cabin .
it was the ferryman contributing to the day ’ s celebrations and letting off a firework .
this petard made gringoire bristle .
are you going to pursue me everywhere ?
even to the ferryman ’ s !
then he looked down at the seine at his feet , and was seized with a horrible temptation .
he said , how gladly would i drown myself if the water weren ’ t so cold !
then he came to a desperate decision .
it was this : since he could not escape the pope of fools , jehan fourbault ’ s banners , may bundles , squibs , and petards , he would boldly plunge into the very heart of the festivities and go to the place de grève .
at least , he thought , i may find there a brand from the bonfire to warm me up , and find a crumb for supper from the three great coats of arms worked in royal sugar they are bound to have set up there on the buffet offered to the public by the town .
the place de grève
that is the charming turret which occupies the northern corner of the place and which , already buried beneath the ignoble coats of distemper which clog the bold lines of its carvings , will perhaps soon have disappeared , submerged by the rising flood of new buildings so rapidly swallowing up all the old façades of paris .
those who , like ourselves , never pass by the place de grève without sparing a look of pity and sympathy for that poor turret , squeezed between two ramshackle louis xiv buildings , can easily reconstruct in their mind ’ s eye the whole collection of buildings to which it belonged and thus recreate in its entirety the old gothic place of the fifteenth century .
it formed , as it does today , an irregular trapezium , bounded on one side by the river quay , and on the other three by a series of tall , narrow , gloomy houses .
in the daytime one could admire the variety of its buildings , all carved in stone or wood , and already offering complete samples of the different types of medieval domestic architecture , going back from the fifteenth through to the eleventh century , from the casement which was beginning to oust the ogive , back to the round romanesque arch which the ogive had supplanted , and which still occupied , beneath the ogive , the first floor of that ancient house of the tour-roland , in the corner of the place giving on to the seine , on the rue de la tannerie side .
at night all that could be distinguished of this mass of buildings was the dark serrated outline of the roofs unfolding their chain of acute angles round the place .
for the past two centuries houses have turned about .
in the centre of the eastern side of the place rose a heavy , heterogeneous construction consisting of three houses in juxtaposition .
it was known by three names , explaining its history , purpose , and architecture : the maison du dauphin. , because charles v as dauphin had lived there ; the marchandise , because it served as the town hall ; the maison-aux-piliers ( domus ad pilorid ) , because of a series of large pillars supporting its three storeys .
there the town could find everything that a good town like paris needs : a chapel , for prayer ; a courtroom , for hearing pleas , and , if necessary , putting the king ’ s men in their place ; and in the loft , an arsenal full of artillery .
for the burghers of paris know that it is not enough in every contingency to pray or to plead for the freedoms of the city , and always have in reserve in a loft of the hôtel de ville some good old rusty arquebus .
the grève then already had the sinister aspect still preserved today by the execrable image it evokes , and dominique boccador ’ s gloomy hôtel de ville , which has replaced the maison-aux-piliers .
it must be said that a permanent gallows and pillory , a justice ’ and a ladder ’ as they were then called , standing side by side in the middle of the paving , contributed not a little to making people avert their gaze from this fatal site , where so many beings full of life and health had breathed their last ; where fifty years later was to be born that saint-vallier ’ s fever , that sickness which is a terror of the scaffold , the most monstrous of all sicknesses , because it comes not from god but from man .
it is a comforting thought , be it said in passing , that the death penalty which , three hundred years ago still cluttered up with its iron wheels , its stone gibbets , its whole apparatus of punishment permanently fixed into the pavement , the grève , the halles , the place dauphine , the croix-du-trahoir , the marché-aux-pourceaux , the hideous montfaucon , the barrière des sergents , the place-aux-chats , the porte saint-denis , champeaux , the porte baudets , the porte saint-jacques , not to mention the countless ladders ’ of the provosts , the bishop , the chapter , the abbots , the priors with rights of jurisdiction ; not to speak of judicial execution by drowning in the river seine ; it is comforting to think that today , having lost one by one all the pieces of her armour , her profusion of torments , her imaginative and fanciful punishments , her torture for which she had a new leather bed made every five years at the grand châtelet , that old sovereign ruler of feudal society , almost expelled from our laws and our towns , hunted from code to code , driven from place to place , has nothing left in all our vast city of paris but one dishonoured corner of the grève , one wretched guillotine , furtive , anxious , ashamed , seemingly always afraid of being caught red-handed , to judge by the haste with which it disappears once it has done its job .
by the time pierre gringoire reached the place de grève he was numb with cold .
he had gone by way of the pont-aux-meuniers to avoid the throng at the pont-au-change and jehan fourbault ’ s banners ; but the wheels of all the bishop ’ s water-mills had splashed him as he went by and his smock was wringing wet .
so he hurried to get near the splendid bonfire blazing in the middle of the square .
but a considerable crowd was massed all round it .
he said to himself , for gringoire , like any true dramatic poet , was given to monologues ; now they ’ re blocking me from the fire !
yet i could really do with a fireside corner .
devil take the bishop of paris and his water-mills !
i ’ d like to know what use a mill is to a bishop !
does he expect to change from being a bishop into a miller ?
if all he needs for that is my curse , then i freely give it to him , his cathedral , and his mills !
what are they doing there , i ask you ?
they are having a warm ; fine way to enjoy yourself !
they ’ re watching a hundred faggots burn ; a fine entertainment !
looking more closely , he realized that the circle was much wider than it needed to be for enjoying the warmth of the bonfire and that such a mass of spectators had not been attracted merely by the beauty of a hundred faggots blazing away .
in the huge open space left between the crowd and the fire , a girl was dancing .
whether this girl was a human being , a fairy , or an angel was something that gringoire , sceptical philosopher , ironic poet though he was , could not decide straight away , so fascinated was he by the dazzling vision .
she was not very tall , but her slim figure stood so boldly straight that she seemed to be so .
she was dark , but one could see that in daylight her skin would have the fine golden glow of andalusian and roman women .
her small foot too was andalusian , for it fitted both snugly and easily into her dainty shoe .
she was dancing , turning , whirling on an old persian carpet , thrown down carelessly beneath her feet ; and each time her radiant face passed before you as she spun round her great , dark eyes flashed lightning .
around her everyone gazed open-mouthed ; and in truth , while she danced like that , to the thrumming of a tambourine held above her head by her two pure , shapely arms , slim , frail , lively as a wasp , with her golden unpleated bodice , her brightly coloured dress swirling out , her bare shoulders , her slender legs uncovered now and then by her skirt , her dark hair , her blazing eyes , she was a supernatural creature .
truly , thought gringoire , she ’ s a salamander , a nymph , a goddess , a bacchante from mount maenalus !
just then one of the braids of the salamander ’ s ’ hair came undone , and a small brass coin that was attached to it rolled on to the ground .
he said , she ’ s a gypsy .
every illusion had been dispelled .
she started to dance again .
but disenchanted though gringoire was , the overall scene was not without glamour and magic : the bonfire cast a harsh red glare which flickered brightly over the circle of faces in the crowd , over the girl ’ s brown forehead , and on the square behind cast a pale reflection mingled with their wavering shadows , on one side upon the black , wrinkled old façade of the maison-aux-piliers , on the other on the stone arms of the gibbet .
among the hundreds of faces stained scarlet by this glow , there was one which seemed even more absorbed than all the others in contemplating the dancer .
it was a man ’ s face , austere , calm , sombre .
this man , whose clothes were concealed by the crowd around him , did not look more than 35 years old ; yet he was bald ; at his temples he had scarcely more than a few scanty tufts of hair already grey ; his broad , high forehead was beginning to be furrowed with wrinkles ; but in his deep-set eyes shone an extraordinary youthfulness , ardent vitality , intense passion .
he never took his eyes off the gypsy girl , and while the wild 16-year-old danced and leaped about to the delight of all , his private reverie seemed to become more and more sombre .
from time to time a smile and a sigh met on his lips , but the smile revealed more pain than the sigh .
out of breath , the girl stopped at last , and the people applauded her warmly .
djali , said the girl .
then gringoire saw a pretty little white she-goat come up , nimble , lively , glossy , with gilded horns , gilded hooves , a gilded collar ; he had not noticed it before , for it had remained crouching up till then on a corner of the carpet , watching its mistress dance .
djali , said the dancer , now it ’ s your turn .
and as she sat down , she gracefully held out her tambourine to the goat .
djali , she continued , what month of the year is it ?
the goat raised its foreleg and struck the tambourine once .
it was indeed the first month of the year .
djali , the girl went on , turning the tambourine round , what day of the month is it ?
djali raised her little golden hoof and struck the tambourine six times .
djali , the gypsy continued , once more moving the tambourine about , what hour of the day is it ?
djali tapped seven times .
at the same moment the clock on the maison-aux-piliers struck seven o ’ clock .
the people marvelled .
there ’ s witchcraft behind that , said a sinister voice in the crowd .
it was that of the bald man who never took his eyes off the gypsy girl .
she shuddered and turned away ; but applause broke out , drowning the peevish exclamation .
the applause in fact so effectively wiped it from her mind that she continued her questioning of the goat .
djali , how does maître guichard grand-rémy , captain of the municipal pistoleers , behave in the candlemas procession ?
djali stood up on her hindlegs and began bleating as she marched , with such charming gravity that the entire circle of spectators burst out laughing at this parody of the self-centred piety of the pistoleer captain .
djali , went on the girl , emboldened by her growing success , how does maître jacques charmolue , the king ’ s attorney in the ecclesiastical court , look when he preaches ?
the goat sat down on its rump and began bleating , waving its forelegs about so quaintly that , apart from the bad french and bad latin , it was jacques charmolue to the life , gestures , accent , posture , and all .
and the crowd applauded even louder .
went on the bald man ’ s voice .
the gypsy girl turned round again .
she said , it ’ s that nasty man !
then sticking out her lower lip , she pouted slightly in what seemed like a familiar expression with her , turned on her heel , and began collecting the crowd ’ s contributions in a tambourine .
all sorts of small coins rained down , grands blancs , petits blancs , targes , liards-à l ’ aigle suddenly she passed in front of gringoire .
he stuck his hand in his pocket in such a daze that she stopped .
said the poet , finding reality , that is emptiness , at the bottom of his pocket .
meanwhile the pretty girl was there , looking at him with her huge eyes , holding out the tambourine , waiting .
gringoire was dripping with perspiration .
if he had had all the riches of peru in his pocket he would certainly have given it all to the dancer ; but gringoire did not have peru , and anyhow america had not yet been discovered .
fortunately an unexpected incident came to his rescue .
will you go away , you egyptian locust ?
cried a shrill voice from the darkest corner of the place .
the girl turned round in fright .
this was not the bald man ’ s voice now ; it was a woman ’ s voice , pious and malicious .
however , this cry , which frightened the gypsy girl , delighted a band of children who were prowling about .
it ’ s the recluse from the tour-roland , they shouted , laughing wildly , it ’ s the sachette grumbling !
hasn ’ t she had any supper ?
let ’ s fetch her some scraps from the public buffet .
they all rushed off to the maison-aux-piliers .
meanwhile gringoire had taken advantage of the dancer ’ s confusion to disappear .
the children ’ s shouts reminded him that he had not had any supper either .
but the little rascals ran faster than he did ; when he got there they had cleared the board .
there was not so much left as one of those wretched camichons that sell for five sous the pound .
all that remained on the wall were the delicate fleurs-de-lys , intertwined with rose bushes , painted in 1434 by mathurin biterne .
that was not much of a supper .
going to bed with no supper is tiresome enough ; it is even less fun to go without supper and no prospect of a bed for the night .
gringoire had come to that .
no bread , no bed ; he saw necessity hemming him in on every side , and found necessity most unmannerly .
he had long ago discovered the truth , that jupiter created men in a fit of misanthropy and throughout the wise man ’ s life his fate lays siege to his philosophy .
as for him , he had never known such a total blockade ; he could hear his stomach rumbling in surrender , and thought it very unfair that ill fate should starve his philosophy into capitulation .
he was becoming more and more engrossed in this melancholy reverie when a song , strange but sweet , suddenly tore him out of it .
it was the gypsy girl singing .
the same qualities held good for her voice as for her dancing and her beauty .
it was indefinable and charming ; something pure , resonant , airy , winged , so to speak .
it flowed continuously in passages of soaring lyricism , melodies , unexpected cadences , then simple phrases sprinkled with sharp , sibilant notes , cascades of scales which would have defeated a nightingale , but where the harmony was always present , then softly rippling octaves , rising and falling like the young singer ’ s breast .
her lovely features followed every caprice of her song with peculiar mobility , from the wildest inspiration to the chastest dignity .
at one moment she seemed like a mad woman , at the next a queen .
she sang words in a language unknown to gringoire , and apparently unknown to her too , so little did the expression she gave to her song relate to the sense of the words .
thus these four lines in her mouth expressed wild gaiety :
un cofre de gran riqueza
hallaron dentro un pilar ,
and a moment later she gave this verse such a tone that gringoire felt the tears spring to his eyes :
yet her song breathed joy above all , and she seemed to sing , like a bird , out of serene and carefree happiness .
the gypsy ’ s song had disturbed gringoire ’ s reflections , but in the same way as a swan disturbs the water .
he listened to it in a kind of trance , as if oblivious of all else .
it was the first time for many hours that he felt no pain .
the moment was brief .
the voice of the same woman who had interrupted the gypsy-girl ’ s dance now interrupted her song .
will you shut up , you cicada from hell ?
she cried , still from the same dark corner of the square .
the poor cicada stopped dead .
gringoire blocked up his ears .
he cried , cursed toothless saw , come to break the lyre !
meanwhile the other spectators were grumbling like him .
more than one was saying .
and the invisible old spoil-sport might have had cause to regret her attacks on the gypsy if at that very moment they had not been distracted by the pope of fools ’ procession , which after wending its way through many a street and crossing was now debouching into the place de grève with all its torches and clamour .
that procession , which our readers saw leaving the palais , had been organized as it went along , and had recruited all that paris had to offer by way of rogues , idle thieves , and available vagabonds , so that it was looking of respectable size when it reached the grève .
first came egypt .
the duke of egypt at the head , on horseback , with his counts on foot , holding his bridle and stirrups ; behind them the egyptian men and women in no particular order , with their small children yelling on their shoulders ; all of them , the duke , counts , ordinary people , in rags and tinsel .
then came the realm of argot , thieves ’ cant ; that is to say , all the thieves of france , ranked in order of dignity , the lowest going first .
there thus filed by in column of four , wearing the different insignia of their degrees in this strange faculty , most of them disabled in some way , some limping , some with only one arm , the courtauds de boutanche , coquillarts , hubins , sabouleux , calots , francsmitoux , polissons , piètres , capons , malingreux , rifodés , marcandiers , narquois , orphans , archisuppôts , cagoux , an enumeration to make homer weary .
in the midst of the conclave of cagoux and archisuppôts , the king of argot , or the great coësre , could just be made out , squatting in a little cart drawn by two big dogs .
after the kingdom of the argoteers came the empire of galilee .
guillaume rousseau , emperor of galilee , marched majestically in his purple , wine-stained , robe , preceded by mummers hitting each other and doing a war dance , surrounded by his mace-bearers , his henchmen and clerks from his counting-house .
last came the law clerks , the basoche , with maypoles wreathed in flowers , their black gowns , music fit for a witches ’ sabbath , and great candles of yellow wax .
in the middle of this crowd the high officers of the confraternity of fools bore on their shoulders a litter more heavily laden with candles than the reliquary of sainte-geneviève in time of plague .
each section of this grotesque procession had its own particular music .
the egyptians banged away on their balafos and african tambourines .
the argoteers , an unmusical race , had progressed no further than the viol , the buccina , and the gothic rebec of the twelfth century .
the empire of galilee was hardly more advanced ; one could just make out in its music some wretched rebec from the infancy of the musical art , still confined to re-la-mi but it was around the pope of fools that all the musical riches of the period were displayed in magnificent cacophony .
it was all treble rebecs , counter-tenor rebecs , tenor rebecs , not to mention flutes and brass .
our readers will recall that this was gringoire ’ s orchestra !
it is hard to convey any idea of the degree of proud and blissful satisfaction which the hideous , mournful features of quasimodo had come to express in the course of the journey from the palais to the grève .
it was the first time he had ever enjoyed any feeling of self-esteem .
hitherto all he had known was humiliation , contempt for his condition , disgust for his person .
thus , stone-deaf as he was , he was relishing , like a real pope , the acclamations of this crowd which he hated because he felt hated by them .
