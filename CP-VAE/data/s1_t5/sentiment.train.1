where is the land that apollo calls us wanderers to , the land of our return ?
what do you think ?
then on they came , the ausonian ranks in arms , sicanian tribes and time and again the land of saturn changed its name
how can you hope to garner all the gifts at once ?
or athena 's shrine where the noble trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over ?
tending his flocks one day bucolion took the nymph in a strong surge of love and beneath his force she bore him twin sons
if you have no use for humankind and mortal armor , at least respect the gods
each sacrificed to one or another deathless god , each man praying to flee death and the grind of war
under his weight the boat groans and her stitched seams gape as she ships great pools of water pouring in
and just outside the wall we must dig a trench , a deep ditch in a broad sweeping ring to block their horse and men and break their charge — then these headlong trojans can never rush our armies
but the chief mourners stayed in place , piled timber and built a pyre a hundred feet in length and breadth and aloft it laid the corpse with heavy , aching hearts
but i who walk in majesty , i the queen of the gods , the sister and wife of jove—i must wage a war , year after year , on just one race of men !
so , was it right for a mortal hand to wound , to mortify a god ?
and marshal agamemnon took his lead : pray god you are right , dear brother menelaus !
but glistening-footed thetis reassured him : o my child , wipe these worries from your mind
agamemnon warmed with pleasure as he came up but menelaus lord of the war cry ventured first , why arming now , my brother ?
you know it all so well
long as apollo held the storm-shield firm in his grasp the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
but to lengthen out one ’ s fame with action , that ’ s the work of courage
among the crowds , aeneas addressed them all with : hear me now , mark my words and fill your hearts with joy
fools , erecting their rampart !
well we have strong arms too , arms to defend those ships — and long before that your city packed with people will fall beneath our hands , plundered to rubble
he had just finished dinner , eating , drinking , and the table still stood near
true enough , he came to mycenae once but not at war with us — a guest , a friend , with the royal polynices raising troops that time they geared to attack the holy walls of thebes
then all night long , ringing the great runner achilles , myrmidon fighters mourned and raised patroclus ' dirge
let the games begin !
his tremendous back relaxed , he sags to earth and sprawls over all his cave , his giant hulk limp
seven tripods never touched by fire , ten bars of gold , twenty burnished cauldrons , a dozen massive stallions , racers who earned him trophies with their speed
behind them rank and file withdrew to achaea 's ships
that monster — lycurgus cut him down by stealth , not force at all , on a footpath so cramped his iron club was useless fending off his death
but polites swept up close to deiphobus ' side , caught his brother around the waist with both arms and dragged him clear of the heartbreaking skirmish , far downfield till they reached his team of racers standing behind the rear lines and rush of battle , their driver and handsome chariot held in tow
not with you would it be my fate to search for italy ’ s shores and destined fields and , whatever it may be , the italian river tiber
they both refuse to move , saddled down with grief
three times they drove their full-maned stallions round the body , myrmidon soldiers mourning , and among them thetis stirred a deep desire to grieve
come on , my friend , stand by me , watch me work !
and worse yet , the grim predictions of ancient seers keep terrifying her now with frightful warnings
i have no heart to be left behind , not even if zeus himself would swear to scrape away the scurf of age and make me young again
if we were the same age , i tell you , just as the same fury fills us both — at a single stroke he would bear off glory now or i would bear it off myself !
wing my spears through the air !
what good would protest do ?
patroclus was first to hurl his glinting spear , right at the center mass — the fighters milling round the stern of protesilaus ' blazing ship — and hit pyraechmes , firebrand who led the paeonians , the master riders from amydon , from axius ' broad currents
so come , alone as we are , find the best way out : how do we pull the body clear and save ourselves from the trojan uproar , flee our death , our fate ?
atrides , end your anger — look , it 's nestor !
and in their command sailed eighty long black ships
they will erect for you nomentum , gabii , fidena town and build collatia ’ s ramparts on the mountains , pometia too , and inuis ’ fortress , bola and cora
his task accomplished , the father turned his mind to another matter , set to dismiss juturna from her brother ’ s battles
pray god such grief will never reach my ears
— the cool meriones blazed up in his own defense — they crowd my ship and shelter , hoards of trojan plunder , but out of reach just now
for now , a crushing end awaits an innocent man , unless i ’ m lost to the truth and swept away
on and on they raced , passing the lookout point , passing the wild fig tree tossed by the wind , always out from under the ramparts down the wagon trail they careered until they reached the clear running springs where whirling scamander rises up from its double wellsprings bubbling strong — and one runs hot and the steam goes up around it , drifting thick as if fire burned at its core but the other even in summer gushes cold as hail or freezing snow or water chilled to ice
but ares killed them all and all he left me are these , these disgraces — liars , dancers , heroes only at beating the dancing-rings , you plunder your own people for lambs and kids !
the goddess reached and tugged at her fragrant robe , whispering low , for all the world like an old crone , the old weaver who , when they lived in lacedaemon , wove her fine woolens and helen held her dear
hearing that , the son of atreus strode on
as ajax raised the rim , the archer would mark a target , shoot through the lines — the man he hit dropped dead on the spot — and quick as a youngster ducking under his mother 's skirts he would duck under ajax ' shield and the gleaming shield would hide him head to toe
but sprinting close to king odysseus ' fleet where the argives met and handed down their laws , the grounds where they built their altars to the gods , there he met eurypylus , euaemon 's gallant son , wounded , the arrow planted deep in his thigh , and limping out of battle
but ares swept down to the trojans , helmet flashing , and pacing him went phoebus with long hair streaming and artemis showering arrows , leto and river xanthus and goddess aphrodite strong with eternal laughter
and trampling his chest achilles tore his gear off , glorying over him now : lie there with the dead !
twelve cities of men i have stormed and sacked from shipboard , eleven i claim by land , on the fertile earth of troy
they loosed from harness the horses and the mules , they led the herald in , the old king 's crier , and sat him down on a bench
rumor , already in flight with the first alarms of sorrow , fills evander ’ s ears , evander ’ s walls and palace , rumor that just had trumpeted pallas ’ latian triumph
and atreus ' son himself , powerful agamemnon seized your right hand , shouting out your name : you are mad , my prince !
he flipped the lid of his quiver , plucked an arrow fletched and never shot , a shaft of black pain
how that fellow sleeps !
as a wolf prowling in wait around some crowded sheepfold , bearing the wind and rain in the dead of night , howls at chinks in the fence , and the lambs keep bleating on , snug beneath their dams
we will never shame your kingdom , nor will your fame be treated lightly , no , our thanks for your kind work will never die
agamemnon rose to his feet
the wife of promachus , alegenor 's son , will never thrill to her dear husband striding home from the wars that day the sons of achaea sail from troy !
soon the dawn had raised her light that gives men life , wretched men , calling them back to labor and mortal struggle
stop this fighting , now
euanthes the phrygian , mimas too , a comrade of paris just his age
come , shall we march against them ?
my heart grieves for hector
and diores backs him up with loud appeals : he finished third , but no third prize for him if the victor ’ s prize returned to salius ’ hands
agamemnon turned to the sacred herald : quick , talthybius
break your pacts of peace !
why don ’ t you look first where you left your father , anchises , spent with age ?
now , at last , drive this killing plague from the armies of achaea !
cursing each other here like a pair of nagging women boiling over with petty , heartsick squabbles , blustering into the streets to pelt themselves with slander , much of it true , much not
why on the road ? —in armor !
nestor sat down again
and now he might have gutted the ships with fire , blazing fire — but queen hera impelled agamemnon , out on the run already , to go and rouse his men
the rascal doubled over , tears streaking his face and a bloody welt bulged up between his blades , under the stroke of the golden scepter 's studs
young trojans too , their camp gates spread wide , come pouring out to help ascanius now
plenty of insults we could fling against each other , enough to sink a ship with a hundred benches !
why , he should have prayed to the deathless gods !
let the earth gape and swallow him on the spot !
if i have always kept your rites—a far cry from aeneas ’ men who stain your rites with war
tarquitus blocked his path as aeneas blazed on and cocking back his spear he flings it and stakes the breastplate fast to the shield ’ s groaning weight
that ferryman there is charon
but glorious hector taunted patroclus ' body , dead as he was , why , patroclus — why prophesy my doom , my sudden death ?
here those who hated their brothers , while alive , or struck their fathers down or embroiled clients in fraud , or brooded alone over troves of gold they gained and never put aside some share for their own kin—a great multitude , these— then those killed for adultery , those who marched to the flag of civil war and never shrank from breaking their pledge to their lords and masters : all of them , walled up here , wait to meet their doom
you ’ ll soon see whose windy boasts of glory cheat him blind !
and putting the veteran thrasymedes in command , he ran back to bestride patroclus ' corpse again and flanking the two aeantes now , reported briskly , i sent antilochus
always dear to your heart , strife , yes , and battles , the bloody grind of war
pack all these things aboard !
these picked men , still marching in from the whole armada , pressing toward the temple amid the rising din to plead for some good will
so the men in heavy armor fought at the front , they grappled trojans and hector helmed in bronze while locrians slung from the rear , safe , out of range , till the trojan troops forgot their lust for blood as showering arrows raked their ranks with panic
in the face of blissful gods and mortal men , in the face of that unbending , ruthless king — if the day should come when the armies need me to save their ranks from ignominious , stark defeat
the swift runner recognized him at once — disarmed , no shield , no helmet , no spear left , he would scattered all his gear on the bank , sweating , clambering out of the ford exhausted , knees buckling
and all night long the tiber lulled his swell , checking his current so his waves would lie serene , silent , still as a clear lagoon or peaceful marsh , soothing its surface smooth , no labor there for oars
you will never bring him back to life — sooner you must suffer something worse
here , for the first time , aeneas dared to hope he had found some haven , for all his hard straits , to trust in better days
but now menelaus , atrides out for blood , moved in to fight for meges — spear poised in his grip — in from the blind side and struck from behind the trojan 's shoulder so hard the spear came jutting out through his chest in all its fury and dolops reeled and sank , facedown on the ground
each of us must suffer his own demanding ghost
how can he fight the trojans without armor ?
but he sensed it all in his heart , their fear , their charge , and broke the silence for them : welcome , couriers !
all obey me now
he closed on atrides , spear stabbing his shield right on the boss but the bronze could not drive through , so back he drew to his ranks , dodging death , glancing left and right , fearing a lance would graze his flesh
not even my own hector , if he came to the rescue now
my vicious sons — my humiliations !
turnus groans under that barrage , his fury breaks into fire and the outrage bursts from the soldier ’ s deep heart : always a mighty flood of words from you , drances , when battle demands our fighting hands !
now , father , snatch the slim hopes of the trojans out of the jaws of death !
but all the while diana ’ s sentry , opis , posted high on a ridge , has scanned the fighting unperturbed
where did i lose you ?
no , deadly fate in league with apollo killed me
do not just stand there , do not , dear child , waiting that man 's attack — alone , cut off from friends !
meanwhile , hercules was about to move his herds out , full fed from their grazing , ready to go himself when the cows began to low at parting , filling the woods with protest , bellowing to the hills they had to leave
— straining to catch me in your fury !
like a bearded lion whose pride of cubs a deer-hunter has snatched away , out of some thick woods , and back he comes , too late , and his heart breaks but he courses after the hunter , hot on his tracks down glen on twisting glen — where can he find him ?
but if you are serious , speaking from the heart , the gods themselves have blotted out your senses
out of the front lines , into the thick-and-fast of spears they ’ d charge as two centaurs born in the clouds come bolting headlong down from a steep summit , speeding down from homole or from othrys ’ snowy slopes , and the tall timber cleaves wide at their onrush , thickets split with a huge resounding crash
now , as the first stars set , offer the proper prayers to juno , overcome her anger and threats with vows and plead for help
and over it , round it , birds , all kinds , haunting the riverbed and banks , entrance the air with their song and flutter through the trees
may both nations , undefeated , under equal laws , march together toward an eternal pact of peace
true , the luck of battle might have been at risk— well , risk away !
hercules stole our watchdog—chained him , the poor trembling creature , dragged him away from our king ’ s very throne !
no gods force us on— we ’ re mortals , harried by mortal enemies
the will of god ’ s against you
as a heavy surf assaults some roaring coast , piling breaker on breaker whipped by the west wind , and out on the open sea a crest first rears its head then pounds down on the shore with hoarse , rumbling thunder and in come more shouldering crests , arching up and breaking against some rocky spit , exploding salt foam to the skies — so wave on wave they came , achaean battalions ceaseless , surging on to war
i ’ ll make a slaughter , cut you a good clean swath
one thing more i must tell you
so powerful armies drew their battle line dead even till , at last , zeus gave hector the son of priam the greater glory — the first to storm the wall
should he fail , surely they ’ d blow the world away , hurling the land and sea and deep sky through space
here was your finish line , the end of life
here comes aeneas , look , helmed in flashing bronze to oppose achilles now and phoebus speeds him on
no time for delay
and zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied , tomorrow at dawn 's your chance , my ox-eyed queen
with that , he clutched my knees and kneeling , groveling , clung fast
ajax and two heralds , both clear-headed men
why , why in the world if not for helen with her loose and lustrous hair ?
jove himself has whisked away their trusted line of defense
many men has two-faced fortune cheated , only to come back and set them up on solid ground once more
aeneas , gazing at pallas resting there , his head , his face bled white , and his smooth chest splayed apart by a latin spear , the tears came welling up with words of sorrow : child of heartbreak , was it you whom fortune denied me , coming to me all smiles ?
they drive us here—as exiles— with all the arrogance of war
from the ranks of men , euphorbus
he weighed and carried out ten full bars of gold and took two burnished tripods , four fine cauldrons and last a magnificent cup the thracians gave him once — he would gone on an embassy and won that priceless treasure — but not even that did the old man spare in his halls , not now , consumed with desire to ransom back his son
she displays in the sky the strongest sign that ever dazed italian minds and deceived them with its wonders
they have pitched camp right at our ships and rampart , those brazen trojans , they and their far-famed allies , thousands of fires blaze throughout their armies
think of the glory you will gather in their eyes !
but long-enduring odysseus never heard him — down he dashed to the hollow argive ships
— no more care for achilles left inside your heart ?
he went and brought it , handed it to eumelus
she flung her shining veil to the ground and raised a high , shattering scream , looking down at her son
now out with it , point by point
they marched in cadence and sang their ruler ’ s praise like snowy swans you ’ ll see in the misting clouds , winging back from their feeding grounds , their song bursting out of their long throats with beat on beat , resounding far from the river banks and asian marsh that their pulsing chorus pounds
still , i shall go to olympus crowned with snow and repeat your prayer to zeus who loves the lightning
but once they would had their fill of gazing at each other , the old majestic priam broke the silence first : put me to bed quickly , achilles , prince
what gain for you , your lonely life in the forest , serving diana , our quiver round your shoulder ?
why so much grief for me ?
this was my last ordeal , my long journey ’ s end
you go back to him and declare my message : i will not think of arming for bloody war again , not till the son of wise king priam , dazzling hector batters all the way to the myrmidon ships and shelters , slaughtering argives , gutting the hulls with fire
and now his son , cupavo , flanked by fighters his own age on deck , drives along under oars the giant centaur— the monster high on the figurehead makes threats to heave from aloft a massive boulder down on the waves while the long keel cuts its furrow through the deep
i call it pergamum , yes , and my people all rejoice at the old trojan name
he stepped the mast of a dark-prowed man-of-war far down the beach and tethered a fluttering dove atop the pole , its foot looped with a light cord , then challenged men to shoot and hit that mark : the man who hits the fluttering dove up there can carry the whole array of double-axes home !
come — the proof of battle is action , proof of words , debate
torches in hand , they left the hall and fell to work at once and in no time two good beds were spread and made
suddenly all are demanding this accursed war , against all omens , against the divine power of fate , they ’ re spurred by a wicked impulse
the persuasion of a comrade has its powers
so king iarbas appealed , his hand clutching the altar , and jove almighty heard and turned his gaze on the royal walls of carthage and the lovers oblivious now to their good name
your brother aeneas is tossed round every coast on earth , thanks to juno ’ s ruthless hatred , as you well know , and time and again you ’ ve grieved to see my grief
so the old man groaned and seizing his gray hair tore it out by the roots but he could not shake the fixed resolve of hector
in the central hall they are setting out a banquet , draping the gorgeous purple , intricately worked , heaping the board with grand displays of silver and gold engraved with her fathers ’ valiant deeds , a long , unending series of captains and commands , traced through a line of heroes since her country ’ s birth
he was their city 's bastion , always , even though he came from foreign parts , and a mass of allies marched at his command but he excelled them all in battle , always
so they worked away in the rough assaults , but diomedes , which side was the fighter on ?
battles , massacres—caesar , the bride ’ s father , marching down from his alpine ramparts , fortress monaco , pompey her husband set to oppose him with the armies of the east
a team of pylian purebreds drew his chariot
a memento of his host , a pledge of his affection
at last phoenix the old charioteer spoke out , he burst into tears , terrified for achaea 's fleet : sail home ?
my sons ' wives hauled off by the argives ' bloody hands !
but aeneas flies ahead , spurring his dark ranks on and storming over the open fields like a cloudburst wiping out the sun , sweeping over the seas toward land , and well in advance the poor unlucky farmers , hearts shuddering , know what it will bring—trees uprooted , crops destroyed , their labor in ruins far and wide—and the winds come first , churning in uproar toward the shore
so this is how you would bid farewell to troy , yearning to kiss her broad streets good-bye — troy that cost our comrades so much grief ?
i am much younger than you are , lord menelaus — you are my senior , you the greater man
expertly they cut the meat in pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
down they come and leave the heights behind
ajax ready and waiting there would stab each man with his long , rugged pike — twelve he impaled point-blank , struggling up the hulls
we are the ones who ought to do the work
if we held our games now in another hero 's honor , surely i would walk off to my tent with first prize
with that , he slaughtered fitting beasts on the altars : a bull to neptune , a bull to you , our noble apollo , a black ram to the winter storms , and a white ram to the zephyrs fair and warm
remember it we must , and all too well
but you , roman , remember , rule with all your power the peoples of the earth—these will be your arts : to put your stamp on the works and ways of peace , to spare the defeated , break the proud in war
never , never again shall i return from hades once you have given me the soothing rites of fire
hard grief came sweeping over the trojans ' heads — unbearable , irrepressible
so he urged athena already poised for action
couldn ’ t the fires of troy cremate the trojans ?
the battle lines form up
but this—and there is no law of fate to stop it now— this i beg for latium , for the glory of your people
time and again the strong old prophet said he would die in his own halls of a fatal plague or go with the ships and die at trojan hands
in the same breath he struggles to stand erect on his damaged thigh and though his strength is sapped by his deep wound , his spirit is unbroken
there he lay like an olive slip a farmer rears to strength on a lonely hilltop , drenching it down with water , a fine young stripling tree , and the winds stir it softly , rustling from every side , and it bursts with silver shoots — then suddenly out of nowhere a wind in gale force comes storming , rips it out of its trench , stretches it out on the earth — so panthous ' stripling son lay sprawled in death , euphorbus who hurled the strong ashen spear
giant atlas had been his teacher once , and now he sings the wandering moon and laboring sun eclipsed , the roots of the human race and the wild beasts , the source of storms and the lightning bolts on high , arcturus , the rainy hyades and the great and little bears , and why the winter suns so rush to bathe themselves in the sea and what slows down the nights to a long lingering crawl
what lasting thanks for us , for warring with your enemies , on and on , no end ?
the cretan captain idomeneus answered quickly , plenty of others can shield the ships mid-line , the two aeantes , teucer the best achaean archer , an expert too at fighting head-to-head
never disgrace the generation of your fathers
but phoebus apollo spotting her from pergamus heights — the god grim set on victory for the trojans — rose to intercept her
the noble old horseman could only bear him out : true , too true
aeneas , the good captain , could not permit the fury , the blind rage of entellus to rampage any longer
how many gods who hold the halls of olympus have had to endure such wounds from mortal men , whenever we try to cause each other pain
or brace for a last , dying stand though hector 's gone ?
he would not fight the orders of athena
the hive seethes with life , exhaling the scent of honey sweet with thyme
grant , father , our shame be blotted out by our spears , almighty god apollo !
you know the truth — say it !
following them , diores , sprung from the stock of priam ’ s royal house
this is the one the fates demand
the earth was rich with blood of slaughtered herds and the temple doorways wreathed with riots of flowers
so hector prayed and placed his son in the arms of his loving wife
aphrodite , smiling her everlasting smile , replied , impossible — worse , it 's wrong to deny your warm request , since you are the one who lies in the arms of mighty zeus
that ’ s the doom that awaits our sons ’ sons
only patroclus , skilled as the gods themselves while the man was still alive — now death and fate have got him in their grip
my wife trails on behind
incensed for the dead odysseus speared him straight through one temple and out the other punched the sharp bronze point and the dark came swirling thick across his eyes — down he crashed , armor clanging against his chest
we watch it sailing over the topmost palace roofs to bury itself , still burning bright , in the forests of mount ida , blazing its path with light , leaving a broad furrow , a fiery wake , and miles around the smoking sulfur fumes
once arcadia ’ s mothers saw them nearing their homes , their wailing set the walls on fire with grief
the selleis banks where his host the lord euphetes gave him that sturdy bronze to wear in battle , to beat off the bloody attacks of desperate men and now it saved his son 's young flesh from death
down the goddess flashed from the peaks of mount olympus , made her way to her son 's camp , and there he was , she found him groaning hard , choked with sobs
and gaining the place where red-haired menelaus nursed his wound and a growing ring of warlords pressed around him , striding into their midst the godsent healer reached the captain 's side and quickly drew the shaft from his buckled belt — he pulled it clear , the sharp barbs broke back
following hard on their captain ’ s feat and clear success the etruscans swing to attack
he stood there , cast down
his mind swarming with all this , pallas athena swept to his side and cautioned diomedes , back — think only of getting back , great son of tydeus !
the horses mourned , longing now for their driver , their luxurious manes soiled , streaming down from the yoke-pads , down along the yoke
dank night wheels around in mid-career , cruel dawn breaks in the east , and i feel her panting stallions breathing near
in whose hands , my guest , do you leave me here to meet my death ?
in no time , all were tipping wine on the board with happy hearts and praying to the gods
watching it all , the trojan hero heaved in a churning sea of anguish , his thoughts racing , here , there , probing his options , shifting to this plan , that—as quick as flickering light thrown off by water in bronze bowls reflects the sun or radiant moon , now flittering near and far , now rising to strike a ceiling ’ s gilded fretwork
breathing room in war is all too brief
soon as his sister juturna saw such murmurs rise and the hearts of people slipping into doubt , into the lines she goes like camers to the life , a soldier sprung from a grand ancestral clan : his father a name for valor , brilliant deeds , and he himself renowned for feats of arms
if only i outfought you as you can outfight me , i would soon teach you to shirk your work in war — you would pay the price , i swear
honor the god who strikes from worlds away — the son of zeus , apollo !
and seeing the men , patroclus rose up too as the famous runner called and waved them on : welcome !
from there the road leads down to the acheron ’ s tartarean waves
silence held them all , struck dumb by his story , odysseus ' words still ringing in their ears
these mortals do concern me , dying as they are
but once the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen , then the argives mounted a fiercer new attack , fighting beyond their fates
so they would say , fueling comrades ' courage
our race takes root from jove , the sons of dardanus triumph in father jove—of the father ’ s highest stock , our king himself , aeneas of troy , who sent us to your gates
his aide lost no time — the hardy sthenelus rushed to collect the prizes , gave their proud troops the woman to lead away and they carried off the handsome two-eared tripod as he was loosing the horses from the harness
and sarpedon clawing the rampart now with powerful hands , wrenched hard and the whole wall came away , planks and all and the rampart stood exposed , top defenses stripped — sarpedon had made a gaping breach for hundreds
just look at the maniac , born for disaster , double-dealing , lying two-faced god — just now he promised me and hera , the war-god swore he would fight the trojans , stand behind the argives
yet how can a person hear or say a word ?
let me carry this hope of you and all the bolder i go to face the worst
and we all must battle you — you brought that senseless daughter into the world , that murderous curse — forever bent on crimes !
they were drawing abreast , perhaps they ’ d seize the prize if cloanthus had not flung his arms to the sea and poured his prayers to the gods and begged them to hear his vows : you gods , you lords of the waves i ’ m racing over here , i ’ ll gladly steady a pure white bull at your altars , there on shore , and pay my vows—scatter its innards over the salt swell and tip out streams of wine !
but capaneus ' son did not forget the commands the lord of the war cry put him under
in the eyes of all the world you seized his lance and rammed it home yourself , tearing into my rippling , deathless flesh — so now i think i will pay you back for all your outrage !
the father has sped me down to tell you this : so long as you see lord marshal agamemnon storming among the champions , mowing columns down in blood , you must hold back , command the rest of your men to fight the enemy , stand their headlong charge !
and that was ajax ' cry as the giant put fresh fighting spirit in each man
nestor the noble charioteer did not resist
now , since i shall not return to my fatherland , i would give my friend this lock
and over and over the old horseman oeneus begged him , he took a stand at the vaulted chamber 's threshold , shaking the bolted doors , begging his own son !
so you , his gray-eyed girl , may learn what it means to fight against your father
deep in his chest it nestles , ripping into its feast and the fibers , grown afresh , get no relief from pain
at that , as she turned away her neck shone with a rosy glow , her mane of hair gave off an ambrosial fragrance , her skirt flowed loose , rippling down to her feet and her stride alone revealed her as a goddess
and no mean scout , i will never let you down
libations finished , each envoy having drunk to his heart 's content , the party moved out from atrides ' shelters
but no locrians followed the hearty little ajax
but look at you — fatigue from too much charging has sapped your limbs , that or some lifeless fear has paralyzed you now
but every mortal calls the sea-god 's son , aegaeon , though he 's stronger than his father
but i bowed to my love of you , bowed to our kindred blood and my wife ’ s heartrending tears
he embraced acestes in all his glory , heaping splendid gifts on the old king and urging : take them , father !
the earth groaned and rumbled under the huge weight as soldiers took positions — the whole place in uproar
i ’ ll make certain they never think they ’ re fighting greek and pelasgian boys , the recruits that hector warded off ten years
but ruin is strong and swift — she outstrips them all by far , stealing a march , leaping over the whole wide earth to bring mankind to grief
come rising up from my bones , you avenger still unknown , to stalk those trojan settlers , hunt with fire and iron , now or in time to come , whenever the power is yours
and so briseis returned , like golden aphrodite , but when she saw patroclus lying torn by the bronze she flung herself on his body , gave a piercing cry and with both hands clawing deep at her breasts , her soft throat and lovely face , she sobbed , a woman like a goddess in her grief , patroclus — dearest joy of my heart , my harrowed , broken heart !
call up your courage again
they quickly brought out women , flawless , skilled in crafts , seven , and briseis in all her beauty made the eighth
crowning the shield , guarding the fort atop the tarpeian rock , manlius stood before the temple , held the capitol ’ s heights
wait , with the first northwind that lying pirate will desert us , setting sail on the high seas , our virgin as his loot !
what hope can make him loiter among his foes , lose sight of italian offspring still to come and all the lavinian fields ?
so he decreed and hermes the giant-killing guide obeyed at once
empire stirs me no longer now
now go , build me a pyre in secret , deep inside our courtyard under the open sky
up with you now , rescue him from the crash of battle !
juno brooding , scheming , her old inveterate rancor never sated
they were broken men , their lust for battle numbed
but i bring achilles ' prayers !
i will hold back myself and keep the argive armies back that long
and what 's laid up for me , what pittance ?
all withdraw to their stations , plant spears in the ground and cant their shields against them
now hera the ox-eyed queen of heaven drove the sun , untired and all unwilling , to sink in the ocean 's depths and the sun went down at last and brave achaeans ceased the grueling clash of arms , the leveling rout of war
his life breath fled with a groan of outrage down to the shades below
just to think i built your pyre with my own hands , implored our fathers ’ gods with my own voice , only to be cut off from you— how very cruel—when you lay down to die
ca not you hear him calling his armies on , full force , this hector , wild to gut our hulls with fire ?
now , just as the man was about to catch glaucus glaucus suddenly spun and struck , he stabbed his chest , ripped him down with a crash
on one side the gaetulian cities , fighters matchless in battle , unbridled numidians—syrtes , the treacherous sandbanks
the aged priestess answered aeneas briefly : son of anchises—born of the gods , no doubt— what you see are cocytus ’ pools and styx ’ s marsh , powers by which the gods swear oaths they dare not break
but as hector rushed him , idomeneus speared hector , struck the plate on his chest beside the nipple — his long spearshaft splintered off at the head and the trojans shouted out
but nisus gets away , unthinkingly flees the foe to a place called alban later , named for alba then , a spot where latinus kept his sturdy sheepfolds
aeneas sprang down with his shield and heavy spear , fearing the argives might just drag away the corpse , somehow , somewhere
your own scepter ’ s handed over to settlers fresh from troy !
he coiled , struck , fanging her wing — a high thin shriek !
and so the noble son of antenor , brave agenor would never run until he would tested achilles
your own son who never failed in a fight against the argives
thick-and-fast as the snows that fall on a winter dawn when zeus who rules the world brings on a blizzard , displaying to all mankind his weaponry of war
maybe they ’ ll wring from them the price for my escape , avenge my guilt with my loved ones ’ blood , poor things
even he , the mycenaean commander of all greece : the moment he crossed his threshold , down he went at the hands of his wicked queen
never once did we fear achilles so , captain of armies , born of a goddess too , or so they say
backing over and over , the argives gave ground , seeing the lord of battles lead the trojan onset
polypoetes braced for battle killed astyalus — winging his bronze spear odysseus slew pidytes bred in percote , and teucer did the same for the royal aretaon — ablerus went down too , under the flashing lance of nestor 's son antilochus , and elatus under the lord of men agamemnon 's strength — elatus lived by the banks of rippling satniois , in pedasus perched on cliffs — the hero leitus ran phylacus down to ground at a dead run and eurypylus killed melanthius outright — but menelaus lord of the war cry had caught adrestus alive
directing aeneas so—and his men are quick with the sacrifice she demands— the sibyl calls them into her lofty shrine
there , in turn , for a full three hundred years the dynasty of hector will hold sway till ilia , a royal priestess great with the brood of mars , will bear the god twin sons
but the wound — a healer will treat it , apply drugs and put a stop to the black waves of pain
they are filling out their fates to the last gasp , hacked to pieces under a single man 's assault
over the calm deep straits off tenedos swim twin , giant serpents , rearing in coils , breasting the sea-swell side by side , plunging toward the shore , their heads , their blood-red crests surging over the waves , their bodies thrashing , backs rolling in coil on mammoth coil and the wake behind them churns in a roar of foaming spray , and now , their eyes glittering , shot with blood and fire , flickering tongues licking their hissing maws , yes , now they ’ re about to land
no , though as long as i fought on achaea 's lines hector had little lust to charge beyond his walls , never ventured beyond the scaean gates and oak tree
not even dryas ' indestructible son lycurgus , not even he lived long
he sent me off to troy
the day that orphans a youngster cuts him off from friends
and on they came , with good odysseus in the lead , and the envoys stood before him
nor was his heart displeased to see them both — how fast they would obeyed his loving wife 's commands — and first he issued iris winging orders : away , iris !
it 's marvelous — go see for yourself how he lies there fresh as dew , the blood washed away , and no sign of corruption
king agamemnon rose to his feet , raising high in hand the scepter hephaestus made with all his strength and skill
wind-quick iris obeyed at once and down from ida 's peaks she dove to sacred troy , found the son of wise king priam , shining hector standing amidst his teams and bolted cars , and swift as a breeze beside him iris called , hector , son of priam — a mastermind like zeus !
there 's a war to fight with the trojans you stampeded , look , they are packed inside their city walls , but you , you have slipped away out here
as hector turned for home his helmet flashed and the long dark hide of his bossed shield , the rim running the metal edge , drummed his neck and ankles
now you go down to the house of death , the dark depths of the earth , and leave me here to waste away in grief , a widow lost in the royal halls — and the boy only a baby , the son we bore together , you and i so doomed
they covered his whole body deep with locks of hair they cut and cast upon him , and just behind them brilliant achilles held the head , in tears — this was his steadfast friend whom he escorted down to the house of death
the charioteers he spotted , fast with teams , he would halt beside and spur them on : my argives , never relax your nerve , your fighting strength !
on they rushed , bent on the work of tending to his body
or deny me outright
the same honor waits for the coward and the brave
but fate bars the way
and phoebus ’ words were met by a ringing burst of joy mixed with confusion , all our voices rising , asking : where is this city ?
and there beside them the great tactician odysseus , drawn up with his cephallenians grouped around him , bands of them , no mean fighters , watching , waiting
so in a rush each argive captain killed his man
the cretan captain idomeneus answered warmly , trust me , atrides — count on me , your comrade , staunch as i swore at first , that day i bowed my head
even now there are two , lycaon and polydorus — i can not find them among the soldiers crowding troy , those sons laothoe bore me , laothoe queen of women
over what lands , what seas have you been driven , buffeted by what perils into my open arms , my son ?
all as one they make sheets fast and let out canvas bellying now to port and now to starboard , all as one they swing the lofty spars around and swing them back as a favoring sternwind sweeps the fleet straight on
and with that , he handed salius a giant african lion ’ s hide , a great weight with its shaggy mane and gilded claws
panthous ' son polydamas led the debate , a good clear head , and the only man who saw what lay in the past and what the trojans faced
what could she do ?
he is no poor man who owns what they have won , not strapped for goods with all that lovely gold — what trophies those high-strung horses carried off for him !
and now , somewhere , lost on the crags , on the lonely mountain slopes , on sipylus where , they say , the nymphs who live forever , dancing along the achelous river run to beds of rest — there , struck into stone , niobe still broods on the spate of griefs the gods poured out to her
i who saved you before , and along with you your towering city too
and i myself , hector , your ally-to-the-death , a good long way i came from distant lycia , far from the xanthus ' rapids where i left my loving wife , my baby son , great riches too , the lasting envy of every needy neighbor
gazing out on the deep dark swells they wept and wailed : how many reefs , how many sea-miles more that we must cross !
like hounds and lusty hunters closing , ringing a wild boar till out of his thicket lair he crashes , whetting his white tusks sharp in his bent , wrenching jaws and they rush in to attack and under the barks and shouts you can hear the gnash of tusks but the men stand firm — terrible , murderous as he is — so the trojans ringed odysseus dear to zeus , rushing him straight on
i ’ ve seen with my own eyes , calling out to me turnus !
up in arms he threatens to topple italy ’ s towers , bring them down in ruins , already the flaming brands go winging toward the roofs
friendly words , and when he had closed , the prophet ordered presents , hoards of gold and ivory inlays , brought to our ships , crowding our holds with a massive weight of silver , dodona cauldrons , a breastplate linked with mail and triple-meshed in gold , a magnificent helmet peaked with a plumed crest—neoptolemus ’ arms— and then the gifts of honor for my father
so they conferred together , building their resolve
trojans pounded down on them !
until my brother pygmalion batters down my walls ?
slipping behind , tydides dropped to a knee and yanked the winged arrow from his foot as the raw pain went stabbing through his flesh
at the same time , aeneas , just as fierce in the arms his mother gave him , hones his fighting spirit too and incites his anger , glad the war will end with the pact that turnus offers
with that he stabbed at her battle-shield of storm , its dark tassels flaring , packing tremendous force — not even zeus 's lightning bolt can break its front
by our great household gods , by assaracus ’ hearth-god and white-haired vesta ’ s shrine , i swear to you both , nisus , all my hope , my fortune lies in your laps alone
no , no , put our trust in the will of mighty zeus , king of the deathless gods and men who die
some trundle enormous boulders , others dangle , racked to the breaking point on the spokes of rolling wheels
the god was just stripping giant periphas bare , the aetolians ' best fighter , ochesius ' noble son — the blood-smeared ares was tearing off his gear but athena donned the dark helmet of death so not even stark ares could see her now
pray for fair winds !
how that would please the man of ithaca , how the sons of atreus would repay you !
her voice rang out in tears , but the wife of hector had not heard a thing
ah but then , when the son of anchises saw his dying look , his face—that face so ashen , awesome in death— he groaned from his depths in pity , reached out his hand as this picture of love for a father pierced his heart , and said : forlorn young soldier , what can aeneas , in all honor , give you to match your glory now ?
he saw the monstrous achilles and racing on before him trojans whipped in headlong flight , all rescue gone
and the squadrons forge ahead undaunted , swift as ever , sailing safely along as father neptune promised , true , but carried closer in to the sirens ’ rocks— hard straits once , white with the bones of many men— now roaring out with the sounding boom of surf on reef when captain aeneas felt his ship adrift , her pilot lost , and took command himself , at sea in the black night , moaning deeply , stunned by his comrade ’ s fate : you trusted—oh , palinurus— far too much to a calm sky and sea
why , i even dared fling my voice through the dark , my shouts filled the streets as time and again , overcome with grief i called out creusa !
and at once the great soul made a brief reply : no one ’ s home is fixed
was it i who lured the trojan adulterer on to lay sparta low ?
nine nights they passed the hours , hovering over me , keeping the watch by rounds
that 's what the real drill , defensive fighting means to me
leaving priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen of argos , helen for whom so many argives lost their lives in troy , far from native land !
and hector straining to wade into the press and panicked ruck of men , charge them , break them down — he flung terror and stark disaster square in the argive lines , never pausing , giving his spear no rest
all bluff , cunning with words , that 's all you are — trying to make me fear you , lose my nerve , forget my fighting strength
at the point of death , hector , his helmet flashing , said , i know you well — i see my fate before me
achilles quickly set out prizes for the footrace
taking the old man 's hand he gently moved him back
here 's more gold — a half-bar more in the bargain
the fire lapped at the vessel 's belly , the water warmed and soon as it reached the boil in the glowing bronze they bathed and anointed the body sleek with olive oil , closed each wound with a soothing , seasoned unguent and then they laid patroclus on his bier
so , such was i in the ranks of men
now he would veer from the trojan melee in a flash then dart back in a charge , pursuing mobs of men but he could not kill the ones he rushed in force — no way for him now , alone in the hurtling car , to lunge with a spear and still control those racers
my hackles bristled , voice choked in my throat
ascanius steps in , my life depends on father ’ s safe return
no more words — he dashed toward the city , heart racing for some great exploit , rushing on like a champion stallion drawing a chariot full tilt , sweeping across the plain in easy , tearing strides — so achilles hurtled on , driving legs and knees
and the more she tries to pitch the great god off her breast , the more his bridle exhausts her raving lips , overwhelming her untamed heart , bending her to his will
and nestor the noble charioteer replied , royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician , no time for anger now — such misery has overcome our argives
and there , i tell you , a pitched battle flares !
saturn ’ s queenly daughter is just now putting the final touches to the war
but if one saw you here in the rushing dark night he would tell agamemnon straightaway , our good commander
better to slaughter beasts on rocky mountain slopes and young deer in the wild than fight a higher goddess !
and long as i have him with me , still alive , looking into the sunlight , he is racked with anguish
at the same time , grouping against the trojan lines , messapus , the swift latins , coras , his brother too and young camilla ’ s wing—all march into sight , right arms cocked back , thrusting javelins forward , shaking vibrant lances , infantry tramping into position , battle stallions panting , plains mounting to fever pitch
and all of us unite
podalirius , tracking the shepherd alsus , hurtles through the front where the spears shower down , he ’ s rearing over him now with his naked sword but alsus , swirling his axehead back , strikes him square in the skull , cleaving brow to chin and convulsive sprays of blood imbrue his armor
belus had sacked cyprus , plundered that rich island , ruled with a victor ’ s hand
was it for this , my loving mother , you swept me clear of the weapons , free of the flames ?
so the next fool will cringe at the thought of mounting hateful war against our stallion-breaking trojans
but if this trojan , dares , cringes before my weapons , if good aeneas decides and acestes my promoter nods , we ’ ll fight as equals here
you gods , if my lips are pure , i pray for vengeance now— deal such blows to the greeks as they dealt me !
and if it is my fate to die by the beaked ships of achaeans armed in bronze , then die i shall
a black cloud of grief came shrouding over hector but helmed in flashing bronze he hurtled through the front
he has a father too , as old as i am — peleus sired him once , peleus reared him to be the scourge of troy but most of all to me — he made my life a hell
like mercury head to foot , the voice , the glow , the golden hair , the bloom of youth on his limbs and his voice rang out with warnings once again : son of the goddess , how can you sleep so soundly in such a crisis ?
no — if our generous argives will give me a prize , a match for my desires , equal to what i have lost , well and good
think of that breakneck heracles , his violent work , not a care in the world for all the wrongs he would done — he and his arrows raking the gods who hold olympus !
so creusa cries , her wails of anguish echoing through the house when out of the blue an omen strikes—a marvel !
what i really want is to keep my people safe , not see them dying
the commander ’ s words relieve their stricken hearts : my comrades , hardly strangers to pain before now , we all have weathered worse
he sent them off with the strict order ringing in their ears
how he would groan at this , the old horseman peleus , that fine speaker , the myrmidons ' famed commander
both men shone in courage , both men blazed in combat , aeneas the more devout
now sweat will soak the shield-strap round your chest , your fist gripping the spear will ache with tensing , now the lather will drench your war-team 's flanks , hauling your sturdy chariot
then down they lay at last and took the gift of sleep
the trojans roared assent
but in they charge , the rutulian forces seeing the way wide open now
shaft poised , he hurled and his spear 's long shadow flew and it struck achilles ' shield — a dead-center hit — but off and away it glanced and hector seethed , his hurtling spear , his whole arm 's power poured in a wasted shot
and i tell you this — and i know it is the truth — one day glittering gifts will lie before you , three times over to pay for all his outrage
hard sorrows were hanging over many
the brave son of menoetius spoke out first : why do you call , achilles ?
there ’ s no salvation in war
you tell me to forget the plans of storming zeus , all he promised me when he nodded in assent ?
where do we go ?
that wild man — hurl him headlong down before the scaean gates !
any innocent traveler passing them on that road can stir them accidentally — up in arms in a flash , all in a swarm come pouring , each one raging down to fight for home and children — such frenzy seized their hearts , myrmidons pouring out of the ships , ceaseless shouts rising and over them all patroclus ' war cries rousing comrades : myrmidons !
if you had any hope of winning aetolian allies , give it up now
dispel your tears for creusa whom you loved
but achilles , brave as he is , he has no care , no pity for our achaeans
right through the front he plowed like a wild boar ramping in power up on the high mountain ridges , scattering dogs and reckless hunters at one charge when he wheels at bay and drives them down the glades
with weddings and wedding feasts in one and under glowing torches they brought forth the brides from the women 's chambers , marching through the streets while choir on choir the wedding song rose high and the young men came dancing , whirling round in rings and among them flutes and harps kept up their stirring call — women rushed to the doors and each stood moved with wonder
putting all his strength behind it , pandarus hurls his spear , unpolished , knotted , bark still rough but the breezes whisk it away , saturnian juno flicks aside the approaching wound and the weapon stabs the gate
no room there for charioteers to dismount and fight it out , the strait 's too narrow , cramped — we will take a mauling there , i see it all !
your mother commands you now !
soon as he buckled on his elegant gleaming bronze he rushed through troy , sure in his racing stride
it 's wrong to malinger here with talk , wasting time — our great work lies all before us , still to do
down you went , whom neither the greek battalions could demolish , nor could achilles , who razed the realms of priam
struck with fear at the sight of you , they might hold off from attack and achaea 's fighting sons get second wind , exhausted as they are
but why debate , my friend , why thrash things out ?
why , what have i done to you ?
drive your horses right at these mighty argives , seize the higher triumph — seize it now !
showers of whetted spears stuck fast around cebriones , bristling winged arrows whipped from the bowstrings , huge rocks by the salvo battering shields on shields as they struggled round the corpse
myrmidons , battalions ranged in armor with greathearted patroclus , moving out now , the fury bursting inside them , suddenly charged the trojans — they swarmed forth like wasps from a roadside nest when boys have made it their sport to set them seething , day after day tormenting them round their wayside hive — idiot boys !
but thetis answered , warning through her tears , you are doomed to a short life , my son , from all you say !
if a word of what i say is falsely sworn , may the gods deal out such blows to me , such agonies as they deal out to the men who break sworn oaths and take their names in vain !
his sword pierces the bronze mesh of theron ’ s tunic , stiff with its golden scales , and drains his gaping flank
you — the gods have planted a cruel , relentless fury in your chest !
it 's not my way , i would say , to fight at a distance , out of enemy range
— if strategy 's any use
and trojans hearing the brazen voice of aeacides , all their spirits quaked — even sleek-maned horses , sensing death in the wind , slewed their chariots round and charioteers were struck dumb when they saw that fire , relentless , terrible , burst from proud-hearted achilles ' head , blazing as fiery-eyed athena fueled the flames
they would packed behind their shields , ringing patroclus round on all sides , spears jutting as ajax ranged them all and shouted out commands : no one back away from the body !
they yearn to grasp their companions ’ hands in haste but both men are unnerved by the mystery of it all
let them settle here , if so their hearts desire , and build their city walls
but zeus will never accomplish all our best-laid plans
i am aeneas , duty-bound
what land is this , that you can tolerate such barbaric ways ?
whether you ’ re lost or storms have swept you far off course , dangers that sailors often suffer , facing open ocean— shielded now by our riverbanks , you ride at anchor
the gear his father brought from ephyra once
even then , when i forbade him to go to war or make a show of himself in others ' eyes
quick as a wink eurytion , bow long bent and arrow set for release , prayed to his archer brother , aimed at the dove that reveled in open sky , winging under a black cloud— and struck— and down she dropped , dead weight , leaving her life in the stars and bringing home the shaft that shot her through
so the two of them made their pact and parted
so , on such terms they sealed a pact of peace between both sides , witnessed by all the officers of the armies
even then our soldiers sensed that i was the one , the target of that ulysses ’ vicious schemes— they saw it coming , still they held their tongues
but his turn next , menelaus rose with a bronze lance and a prayer to father zeus and lunging out at euphorbus just dropping back , pierced the pit of his throat — leaning into it hard , his whole arm 's weight in the stroke to drive it home and the point went slicing through the tender neck
and there , grizzled gray as he was , he spurred his men , idomeneus ramping amidst the trojans , striking panic
and with that command the prophetess fell silent
this maniac , hector — i can not bear him any longer
and long as i have him with me , still alive , looking into the sunlight , he is racked with anguish
tomorrow tydeus ' son will learn his own strength — if he has the spine to stand the onrush of my spear
they were broken , beaten men , the will of the goddess dead set against them
such terrible grief kept breaking from her heart as aeneas slept in peace on his ship ’ s high stern , bent on departing now , all tackle set to sail
and all the while those vaunting epeans were closing round the fortress , burning to tear it down
but in fact the duel had long seemed uneven to all the rutulians , long their hearts were torn , wavering back and forth , and they only wavered more as they viewed the two contenders at closer range , poorly matched in power
the rest of your prospects ?
menelaus withdrew as he drove antilochus on
but you take up your battle-stations at every point , command them , hold them back
a nightmare broke his sleep and the sweat poured from all over his body , drenched him to the bone
there are no binding oaths between men and lions — wolves and lambs can enjoy no meeting of the minds — they are all bent on hating each other to the death
are they bent on holding tight by the ships , exposed ?
do not leave achilles there on the battlefield as you left patroclus — dead !
if we could haul him from battle , dead as he is , and lodge him behind king priam 's looming walls , our enemies would release sarpedon 's gear at once and then , then we could bring his body back to troy
if i ever roofed a shrine to please your heart , ever burned the long rich bones of bulls and goats on your holy altar , now , now bring my prayer to pass
the sibyl says no more
i reached her in flight and father called it quits despite his towering anger
he never quaked , that tydeus , that great horseman — what force the famous shieldsman used to wield !
help me now in the thick of danger—glory of stars , guard of the groves !
if someone else had commanded me , some mortal man , some prophet staring into the smoke , some priest , i would call it a lie and turn my back upon it
sunlight flooded in and the rays laid bare the earth as turnus , fully armed himself , calls his men to arms
no monsters on earth more cruel , no scourge more savage , no wrath of the gods has ever raised its head from the styx ’ s waters
— he racked his heart and soul — lunge at prince sarpedon , son of storming zeus , or go at the lycians ' mass and kill them all ?
as ravenous wolves come swooping down on lambs or kids to snatch them away from right amidst their flock — all lost when a careless shepherd leaves them straggling down the hills and quickly spotting a chance the wolf pack picks them off , no heart for the fight — so the achaeans mauled the trojans
the good commander orders all masts stepped at once and the yardarms hung with sail
so now let a single urn , the gold two-handled urn your noble mother gave you , hold our bones — together !
a vast din swells in the palace , voices reverberating through the echoing halls
perhaps he will be persuaded
and atrides gave ground , he left the corpse but kept on turning round to face an attack — like a great bearded lion the dogs and field hands drive back from the folds with spears and sharp cries and the brave , battling heart in his chest freezes tight and the big cat , all reluctance , pulls back from the sheds
no braving our infantry , grappling hand to hand , the cowards cling to camp !
dido aglow with beauty holds the bowl in her right hand , pouring wine between the horns of a pure white cow or gravely paces before the gods ’ fragrant altars , under their statues ’ eyes refreshing her first gifts , dawn to dusk
but thetis burst into tears , her voice welling : oh hephaestus — who of all the goddesses on olympus , who has borne such withering sorrows in her heart ?
then iopas , long-haired bard , strikes up his golden lyre resounding through the halls
ah what chilling blows we suffer — thanks to our own conflicting wills — whenever we show these mortal men some kindness
but hector shook his head , his helmet flashing : do not offer me mellow wine , mother , not now — you would sap my limbs , i would lose my nerve for war
look — hector the king of the war cry fights beside our ships , assaulting in all his force
mezentius makes you burn with well-earned rage
and now the trojans collected high on the crest of troy
but the son of oeneus , meleager , cut him down — mustering hunters out of a dozen cities , packs of hounds as well
a black harvest of naked steel bristles far and wide , and the bronze struck by the sun gleams bright and hurls its light to the clouds like a billow whitening under the wind ’ s first gust as crest on crest the ocean rises , its breakers rearing higher until it surges up from its depths to hit the skies
always dear to your heart , strife , yes , and battles , the bloody grind of war
and you , in years to come , will welcome him to the skies , you rest assured—laden with plunder of the east , and he with aeneas will be invoked in prayer
but keep this message firmly in your mind
but no sleep for the headstrong trojans either
who is this stranger just arrived to lodge in our house—our guest ?
and the old and noble priam asked at once , if you really are the royal achilles ' aide , please , tell me the whole truth , point by point
and now from his depths the proud runner groaned : you know , you know , why labor through it all ?
and again she lashed her team and again the stallions flew , holding nothing back , careering between the earth and starry skies as far as a man 's glance can pierce the horizon 's misting haze , a scout on a watchtower who scans the wine-dark sea — so far do the soaring , thundering horses of the gods leap at a single stride
roars of the crowd re-echo , cheering on his challenge , the air resounds with cries
now all towering troy is ruined top to bottom !
why should aeneas suffer here , for no good reason , embroiled in the quarrels of others , not his own ?
with that challenge athena levered sthenelus out the back of the car
a son , or one of his son ’ s descendants born of noble stock ?
yield to apollo now and take the better course— the god shows the way !
you — i hate you most of all the warlords loved by the gods
sprinting a long way back , downfield and fast , hector rejoined his men and sinking down onto one knee , propped himself with a strong hand planted against the earth — and the world went black as night across his eyes
an ancient city is falling , a power that ruled for ages , now in ruins
but zeus , somehow , was bent on this awesome slaughter of achaeans
he refused to let his two boys march to war , this man-killing war , but the young ones fought him all the way — the forces of black death drove them on and diomedes a marvel with a spear destroyed them both , stripped them of life breath and tore their gear away and odysseus killed hippodamus , killed hypirochus
this response from father faunus , a warning sent in the silent night—latinus did not seal his lips , rumor had spread it already , flying far and wide through ausonia ’ s towns before the sons of troy tied up their fleet at the river ’ s green embankments
just as diomedes hefted a boulder in his hands , a tremendous feat — no two men could hoist it , weak as men are now , but all on his own he raised it high with ease , flung it and struck aeneas ' thigh where the hipbone turns inside the pelvis , the joint they call the cup — it smashed the socket , snapped both tendons too and the jagged rock tore back the skin in shreds
never again will you and i , alive and breathing , huddle side-by-side , apart from loyal comrades , making plans together — never
he fills with wonder— he knows nothing of these events but takes delight in their likeness , lifting onto his shoulders now the fame and fates of all his children ’ s children
we will save your life — this time too — master , mighty achilles !
you were my pride throughout the city night and day — a blessing to us all , the men and women of troy : throughout the city they saluted you like a god
why , mars had the force to destroy the giant lapith race !
he himself , they cry , he should decide it all with his own sword and shield , since he lays claim to the realm of italy , claims the lion ’ s share of honor for himself !
and just as our two opposing armies clashed i was the first to kill a man and seize his team , the spearman mulius , son-in-law to their king and wed to his eldest daughter , blond agamede , skilled with as many drugs as the wide world grows
but i am not to blame !
she wanders in frenzy through her city streets like a wounded doe caught all off guard by a hunter stalking the woods of crete , who strikes her from afar and leaves his winging steel in her flesh , and he ’ s unaware but she veers in flight through dicte ’ s woody glades , fixed in her side the shaft that takes her life
once they would gathered , crowding the meeting grounds , the swift runner achilles rose and spoke among them : son of atreus , now we are beaten back , i fear , the long campaign is lost
so plan your attack , my friend , muster all your skills or watch the prize slip by !
reaching this haven here , where now you will see the steep ramparts rising , the new city of carthage—the tyrians purchased land as large as a bull ’ s-hide could enclose but cut in strips for size and called it byrsa , the hide , for the spread they ’ d bought
euryalus froze , his heart pounding with love of praise and he checks his fiery friend at once : so , nisus , grudging your friend a share in your fine exploit ?
look at the savage slaughter he has made !
the closest enemy ranks he mows down with iron , reaping a good wide swath through the latian front , blazing with rage as his sword-blade hacks that path , hunting for you , turnus , so proud of your latest kill
first a race for our swift ships , then for our fastest man afoot , and then our best and boldest can step up to win the javelin-hurl or wing the wind-swift arrow or dare to fight with bloody rawhide gauntlets
and all the achaeans shouted their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking diomedes ' challenge
and now the lord of men agamemnon has disgraced him , seizes and keeps his prize , tears her away himself
when at an anxious time by a secret river ’ s run , under the oaks along the bank you find a great sow stretched on her side with thirty pigs just farrowed , a snow-white mother with snow-white young at her dugs : that will be the place to found your city , there your repose from labor lies
trojans and latins , struggling to rout each other , seesawing back and forth as they fight it out on italy ’ s very doorstep
here the ancient line of the earth , the titans ’ spawn , flung down by lightning , writhe in the deep pit
at pyrrhus ’ death , part of his kingdom passed to helenus , who named the plains chaonian—all this realm , chaonia , after the trojan chaon , and built a trojan fortress , the ilian stronghold rising on this ridge
but then , atrides , harrowed as you will be , nothing you do can save you — not when your hordes of fighters drop and die , cut down by the hands of man-killing hector !
but grief came over glaucus , hearing his comrade 's call
desperate straits — we ca not hold out much longer
so off they went , getting some distance on their way and reached the asopus ' grassy banks and reedbeds
nothing can fight the son of cronus , zeus , not even achelous king of rivers vies with zeus , not even the overpowering ocean 's huge high tides , the source of all the rivers and all the seas on earth and all springs and all deep wells — all flow from the ocean but even the ocean shrinks from the mighty father 's bolt when terrible thunder crashes down the skies !
all aimless then , your fires high in the clouds that terrify us so ?
his helmet flashing , hector wheeled with a dark glance : enough , polydamas !
they say enceladus ’ body , half-devoured by lightning , lies crushed under etna ’ s mass , the mighty volcano piled over him , breathing flames from its furnaces blasting open , and every time the giant rolls on his bone-weary side all sicily moans , quakes , shrouds the sky with smoke
and someday one will say , one of the men to come , steering his oar-swept ship across the wine-dark sea , there 's the mound of a man who died in the old days , one of the brave whom glorious hector killed
but lausus rages on , berserk as the savage fury surges higher now in the trojan captain ’ s heart
gouged by my spear you will give me glory now , you will give your life to the famous horseman death !
look at us here , engaging argives with a vengeance , true , but off on the fringe of brutal all-out war while our central force is routed pell-mell , men and chariots flung against each other
first in the latin ranks , juturna caught the sound , she knew what it meant and , seized with trembling , fled
disdaining the forces of latinus !
consigning the women to the town , they disembark all those who elect to stay , who feel no need for glory
more ransom a son of the stallion-breaking trojans might just fetch from troy ?
god forbid his anger destroy the army he commands
yes , for in my heart and soul i know this well : the day will come when sacred troy must die , priam must die and all his people with him , priam who hurls the strong ash spear !
now headlong on and fight !
but i would never hurt you — and what 's more , i would beat off any man who would do you harm : you remind me of my dear father , to the life
as he sprang in flight the red-haired captain hit him , splitting his belt , and bronze went ripping through his flesh and down he went with a crash
pray to wing your way to the starry sky or bury yourself in the earth ’ s deep pits !
i never set my eyes on her again
with that he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground and patroclus straight across , as soon as he saw him , leapt from his car too
what of the trojans putting the latins to the torch ?
many others shrink before him
not even bacchus in all his glory , driving his team with vines for reins and lashing his tigers down from nysa ’ s soaring ridge
the stars go wheeling by , the full of the dark is gone — two watches down but the third 's still ours for action
trapped by his craft , that cunning liar sinon , we believed his story
the wind ’ s shifted , surging athwart our beam , roaring out of the black west , building into clouds !
no looking him in the face , no trying to reach him with a word
then dardanus had a son in turn , king erichthonius , and he was the richest man in all the world — three thousand mares he owned , grazing the marshes , brood-mares in their prime , proud of their leaping foals
and all the while the armies tense in a broad circle watched for horses flying back on the plain in a rising whirl of dust
you are the disaster
soaring up with the clouds to the broad sweeping sky he quickly gained the gods ' stronghold , steep olympus , and settling down by the side of cronus ' great son zeus , his spirit racked with pain , ares displayed the blood , the fresh immortal blood that gushed from his wound , and burst out in a flight of self-pity : father zeus , are not you incensed to see such violent brutal work ?
i tell you this , so help me it 's the truth : if i catch you again , blithering on this way , let odysseus ' head be wrenched off his shoulders , never again call me the father of telemachus if i do not grab you , strip the clothing off you , cloak , tunic and rags that wrap your private parts , and whip you howling naked back to the fast ships , out of the armies ' muster — whip you like a cur !
the troops moved out with loggers ' axes in hand and sturdy cabled ropes as mules trudged on ahead
the others tried to snatch our queen from the bridal bed of death !
he was the greatest joy of troy and all our people !
yet he himself , since dido who means the world to him knows nothing , never dreaming such a powerful love could be uprooted—he will try to approach her , find the moment to break the news gently , a way to soften the blow that he must leave
none but telamonian ajax ' giant shield
it degrades you to curry favor with that man , and i will hate you for it , i who love you
or slashed his men with steel , butchered ascanius , served him up as his father ’ s feast ?
they must not destroy them
but since that courage of yours would leap all bounds , come share the struggle with me
but now , for the moment , let me seize great glory !
whatever tribute a tomb can give , whatever balm a burial , i am only too glad to give
sail home to the fatherland we love !
there he went , the hero leading many thousands , and took his own seat on a built-up platform mid the growing crowd
the work done , the feast laid out , they ate well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
now , no sooner had jove ’ s dear wife perceived that dido was in the grip of such a scourge— no thought of pride could stem her passion now— than juno approaches venus and sets a cunning trap : what a glittering prize , a triumph you carry home !
by day she keeps her watch , crouched on a peaked roof or palace turret , terrorizing the great cities , clinging as fast to her twisted lies as she clings to words of truth
and he left them there , dead , and he made a rush at abas and polyidus , sons of eurydamas , an aged reader of dreams , but the old prophet read no dreams for them when they set out for troy — diomedes laid them low then swung to attack the two sons of phaenops , hardy xanthus and thoon , both men grown tall as their father shrank away with wasting age
book two : the great gathering of armies
even a fool learns something once it hits him
but the thebans rose in anger , lashed their teams and packed an ambush to meet him heading back — full fifty fighters with two chiefs in the lead , hunter the son of bloodlust , strong as the gods , and killerman 's son , the gifted cutthroat slaughter
atrides hauled his corpse from under the trojans toward his own massing friends
but he still would not neglect atrides ' order
and apollo lord of the silver bow and queen athena , for all the world like carrion birds , like vultures , slowly settled atop the broad towering oak sacred to zeus whose battle-shield is thunder , relishing those men
and a rising sternwind surges , drives our vessels on and at last we ’ re gliding into the old curetes ’ harbor
a man , a mere mortal , his doom sealed long ago ?
the crews are shouting , cables screeching—suddenly cloudbanks blotting out the sky , the light of day from the trojans ’ sight as pitch-black night comes brooding down on the sea with thunder crashing pole to pole , bolt on bolt blazing across the heavens—death , everywhere men facing instant death
but hera the queen broke in , her eyes open wide : decide in your own mind , god of the earthquake , whether to save aeneas now or let him die , crushed by achilles , for all his fighting heart
but athena , eyes bright , taking ares in hand , called the violent god away with : ares , ares , destroyer of men , reeking blood , stormer of ramparts , why not let these mortals fight it out for themselves ?
that empty glory of yours a runner 's glory , a scurrying girl 's at that
what tears could match our torments now ?
but messapus will , i trust , tolumnius will , that soldier of fortune , and all the captains sent by so many lands , and no small glory waits for the men picked out from latian and laurentine fields
we act on command , we worship the powers of the place , then sail on past the helorus ’ rich , marshy fields , then brush by the jutting reefs of craggy cape pachynus , then distant camerina heaves into view , a town the fates will never allow to move , then gela ’ s fields and gela named for its rushing torrent
you will die of shame if the dogs of ilium make patroclus ripping sport
then , at a decent distance from the ships , we burn the bodies , so every soldier here can carry back the bones to a dead man 's sons when he sails home again
the end closed in around him
ah but the two of you — long ago the trembling shook your glistening limbs before you could glimpse the horrid works of war
we both know each other 's birth , each other 's parents , we have heard their far-flung fame on the lips of mortal men , though you have never set eyes on mine , or i on yours
we will simply offer the argives tactics that may save them — so they wo not all fall beneath your blazing wrath
both down but menelaus pitied them both , yes , and out for blood he burst through the front , helmed in fiery bronze , shaking his spear , and ares ' fury drove him , ares hoping to see him crushed at aeneas ' hands
or does he refuse , does rage still grip his proud , mighty spirit ?
and from all i dragged off piles of splendid plunder , hauled it away and always gave the lot to agamemnon , that son of atreus — always skulking behind the lines , safe in his fast ships — and he would take it all , he would parcel out some scraps but keep the lion 's share
day and night i groan , brooding over the countless griefs , groveling in the dung that fills my walled-in court
many weapons , too , hang on the hallowed doors , captured chariots , curved axes , crested helmets , enormous bolts from gates , and lances , shields and ramming beaks ripped from the prows of ships
now the hundred immense mouths of the house swing open , all on their own , and bear the sibyl ’ s answers through the air : you who have braved the terrors of the sea , though worse remain on land—you trojans will reach lavinium ’ s realm—lift that care from your hearts— but you will rue your arrival
rage — goddess , sing the rage of peleus ' son achilles , murderous , doomed , that cost the achaeans countless losses , hurling down to the house of death so many sturdy souls , great fighters ' souls , but made their bodies carrion , feasts for the dogs and birds , and the will of zeus was moving toward its end
just as furious now those two , aeneas , turnus rampaging through the battle , now their fury boils over inside them , now their warring hearts at the breaking point—they don ’ t concede defeat— and now they hack their wounding ways with all their force
helen ’ s glory , gifts she carried out of mycenae , fleeing argos for troy to seal her wicked marriage— the marvelous handiwork of helen ’ s mother , leda
mother — i did your bidding , did my work
he called talthybius and eurybates briskly , his two heralds , ready , willing aides : go to achilles ' lodge
the man ’ s courage , the sheer pride of his line , they all come pressing home to her , over and over
to think in all my misery not one god can bring himself to rescue me from this river !
born of a trojan mother to the river-god crinisus , acestes , never forgetting his age-old lineage , gladly welcomes his trojan friends ’ return
come , we will set these things to rights later — if any offense has passed between us now
as the trojan hero paused beside her , recognized her through the shadows , a dim , misty figure—as one when the month is young may see or seem to see the new moon rising up through banks of clouds— that moment aeneas wept and approached the ghost with tender words of love : tragic dido , so , was the story true that came my way ?
and achilles stared with all his might , dazzled , disgusted too , and addressed his own great heart : impossible — look , a marvel right before my eyes !
do as your own impulse bids you
that ’ s what the gods must mean
you too , you are a far cry from the youngest argive here , nor are the eyes in your head our sharpest scouts but you are always blustering , you , you foul-mouthed — why must we have you blurting out this way in the face of keener men ?
as he watched the old man he filled with pity and quickly summoned hermes , his own dear son : hermes — escorting men is your greatest joy , you above all the gods , and you listen to the wish of those you favor
and worse , i see my trojan enemies crying for my blood
always misery warms your heart , your prophecies — never a word of profit said or brought to pass
little iulus , walk beside me , and you , my wife , follow me at a distance , in my footsteps
and i will add the rites and the forms of worship , and make them latins all , who speak one latin tongue
suddenly , getting no password he can trust , he sensed he ’ d stumbled into enemy ranks !
antilochus closed to tear the gear from his shoulders , glancing left and right as trojans massed against him , plunging from every side to batter down his shield but they could not pierce that broad glistening hide — no scoring his tender young flesh with ruthless bronze
but achilles strode back to his shelter now and opened the lid of the princely inlaid sea chest that glistening-footed thetis stowed in his ship to carry , filled to the brim with war-shirts , windproof cloaks and heavy fleecy rugs
no , now menelaus the great spearman ran him through , square between the blades as he fled and raced ahead , tearing into his flesh , drilling out through his chest — he crashed facedown , his armor clanged against him
he would never breed more sons to leave his riches to
propping an end against the ground as cohorts braced their shields in a tight wedge to hide him , fearing bands of argives might just leap to their feet before he could hit menelaus , atreus ' fighting son
the one man , past all others , zeus has plunged in troubles , year in , year out , for as long as the life breath fills my lungs and the spring in my knees will lift me
so he mocked as athena and queen hera muttered between themselves , huddled together , plotting troy 's destruction
so they labored to haul patroclus from the war , back to the beaked ships as fighting flared behind them wild as a flash fire , sprung out of nowhere , storming down on a teeming city , houses caving in to the big blaze as gale-winds whip it into a roaring conflagration
row for your lives , my shipmates—backs in the oars , now stroke !
haul ships to shore
and iris , zeus 's crier , standing alongside priam , spoke in a soft voice , but his limbs shook at once — courage , dardan priam , take heart !
nisus already picks his way , wheeling , groping back through the whole deceptive wood , retracing , scouring his tracks through the silent brush
great boulders they trundle down on the raiders , huge weights , trying to break their shielded troops but under the tortoise-shell they gladly take their blows
but if such a wild desire seizes on you—twice to sail the stygian marsh , to see black tartarus twice— if you ’ re so eager to give yourself to this , this mad ordeal , then hear what you must accomplish first
they rushed to support their lord as he went bustling on and lurching nearer to thetis , took his polished seat , reached over to clutch her hand and spoke her name : thetis of flowing robes !
and apollo swept aeneas up from the onslaught and set him down on the sacred heights of pergamus , the crest where the god 's own temple had been built
patroclus told his friends and serving-women to pile a deep warm bed for phoenix , quickly
none more winning among aeneas ’ soldiers , none who strapped on trojan armor , a young boy sporting the first down of manhood , cheeks unshaved
the end closed in around him
the majestic king of troy slipped past the rest and kneeling down beside achilles , clasped his knees and kissed his hands , those terrible , man-killing hands that had slaughtered priam 's many sons in battle
thick-and-fast as the snow comes swirling down from zeus , frozen sharp when the north wind born in heaven blasts it on — so massed , so dense the glistening burnished helmets shone , streaming out of the ships , and shields with jutting bosses , breastplates welded front and back and the long ashen spears
but i never saw his eyes — the team sped by me , tearing on full tilt
some sling burnished quivers over their shoulders , high on their necks the torques of flexible , braided gold encircle each boy ’ s neck
now come , erato—who were the kings , the tides and times , how stood the old latin state when that army of intruders first beached their fleet on italian shores ?
like phorbas to the life , the god sat high astern , pouring his persuasions into your ears : son of iasius , palinurus , the sea , all on its own , is sweeping the squadrons on , the wind is blowing steady
and first he met a son of dardan priam just escaping the rapids — lycaon , the very man achilles seized himself , once on a midnight raid , and hauled from his father 's orchard , resisting all the way
bodies everywhere— they can see them stretched in the grasses , sunk in a drunken stupor , chariot poles tipped up on shore , bodies of fighters trapped in the wheels and harness , weapons and winecups too are strewn about
huge telamonian ajax rose to meet the challenge , tydeus ' son rose too , the powerful diomedes
the decks are awash , the charred timbers drenched till all the fires are slaked and all the ships , except for the four hulls lost , are saved from ruin
look — all that i promised once i am performing now : i have dragged hector here for the dogs to rip him raw — and here in front of your flaming pyre i will cut the throats of a dozen sons of troy in all their shining glory , venting my rage on them for your destruction !
but never bow to suffering , go and face it , all the bolder , wherever fortune clears the way
a far cry from the pledge i made evander for his son !
she shouts , so slow to pray , to swear your vows ?
so down in their midst speeds iris—no stranger to mischief— putting aside the looks and gown of a goddess , turning into beroë , aged wife of doryclus the tmarian , a woman of fine , noble birth who once had fame and sons
back through jutting stakes and across the trench they fled , and hordes were cut down at the argives ' hands — the rest , only after they reached the chariots , stood fast , blanched with fear , whipped in desperate flight
but the other half were packed in the silver-whirling river , into its foaming depths they tumbled , splashing , flailing — the plunging river roaring , banks echoing , roaring back and the men screamed , swimming wildly , left and right , spinning round in the whirlpools
be my messenger , idmon
but if they are dead already , gone to the house of death , what grief to their mother 's heart and mine — we gave them life
her gray eyes afire , the goddess pallas thrilled that the man had prayed to her before all other gods
who could tell such things—not even a myrmidon , a dolopian , or comrade of iron-hearted ulysses— and still refrain from tears ?
easy to see what help zeus lends to mortals , either to those he gives surpassing glory or those he saps and wastes , refuses to defend , just as he wastes the argives ' power but backs us now
he can not get enough of them , filled with wonder , turning them over , now with his hands , now his arms , the terrible crested helmet plumed and shooting fire , the sword-blade honed to kill , the breastplate , solid bronze , blood-red and immense , like a dark blue cloud enflamed by the sun ’ s rays and gleaming through the heavens
the trojans assembled hard by priam 's gates , gathered together there , young men and old , and rushing closer , racing iris addressed them , keying her voice to that of priam 's son polites
pyraechmes led the paeonians , reflex bows in hand , hailing from amydon far west and the broad river axius , axius , clearest stream that flows across the earth
god store up such pains for his own head and all his sons !
an iron tower looms on high where tisiphone , crouching with bloody shroud girt up , never sleeping , keeps her watch at the entrance night and day
tell me , what should i do ?
and first the trophies are placed on view amid the field : sacred tripods , leafy crowns and palms , the victors ’ prizes , armor , robes dyed purple , and gold and silver bars
and caustic drances lends weight to their side
the greek battalions are swarming round them all , and if my love had never rushed to the rescue , flames would have swept them off by now or enemy sword-blades would have drained their blood
by the sky ’ s lovely light and the buoyant breeze i beg you , by your father , your hopes for iulus rising to his prime , pluck me up from my pain , my undefeated captain !
and i , i will lead the way and the son of priam wo not stand up against us , not for long , i tell you , not for all his fury
why , think what they say of mighty heracles — there was a man , my father , that dauntless , furious spirit , that lionheart
now they could make out hector lord of the war cry , all his troops , squads in reserve and clear of battle , forward squads that fought at the fast trim ships
allecto flings a snake from her black hair at the queen and thrusts it down her breast , the very depths of her heart , and the horror drives her mad to bring the whole house down
or now do you all abandon sacred troy , all in panic — such was the man who died , your finest , bravest man
save me at least
quick as you can to the grand sea lord poseidon
so , let us rule this people in common : joint command
now , hear the treachery of the greeks and learn from a single crime the nature of the beast
but at last a cohort marked the driver 's straits , alcimedon the son of laerces , haemon 's grandson coming behind the chariot , shouted out , automedon !
and you , achilles , show some human kindness too , in your own heart
to trust his walls , the whole command of the battle to a boy ?
do as you please , zeus
but he quickly found one more , on the left flank of the heart-wrenching carnage — royal paris , fair-haired helen 's consort was rousing comrades , driving them back to battle
and niobe , gaunt , worn to the bone with weeping , turned her thoughts to food
choose a sturdy spear
or if no force can clear our path , you will go down with me
if only you ’ d been so passionate for him , then as now , we would have been in our rights to arm the trojans , even then
no way for him to escape the dogs and birds !
in the same breath diomedes came on storming toward them — closer , look , closing — lashing his team nonstop , full-shoulder strokes , making them kick high as they hurtled toward the goal
now all these gifts will be handed him at once
remember the wind that scatters the dry chaff , sweeping it over the sacred threshing floor , the men winnowing hard and blond demeter culling grain from dry husk in the rough and gusting wind and under it all the heaps of chaff are piling white
and now , muse , sing all those fighting men who lived in pelasgian argos , the big contingents out of alus and alope and trachis , men of phthia and hellas where the women are a wonder , all the fighters called achaeans , hellenes and myrmidons ranked in fifty ships , and achilles was their leader
latinus , too , has wealth and the will to share it
from oechalia he came , from oechalia 's king eurytus , boasting to high heaven that he could outsing the very muses , the daughters of zeus whose shield resounds with thunder
priam 's people could hardly hold the old man back , frantic , mad to go rushing out the dardan gates
one life , for the lives of many men
as a pair of crook-clawed , hook-beaked vultures swoop to fight , screaming above some jagged rock — so with their battle cries they rushed each other there
no blind man 's watch , no , apollo saw athena take tydides in hand , and raging against her plunged into the main mass of trojan fighters to rouse a thracian captain called hippocoon , a loyal kinsman of rhesus
i am filled with fear that breakneck hector will bring his word to pass — the threat he hurled against me once in a trojan muster that he would never leave our ships and return to troy till he would torched our hulls and slaughtered all our men
he thought , and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground
our boys—they ’ re up all night , hunting , scouring the woods , their sport is breaking horses , whipping shafts from bows
what if we set you free or you should slip away ?
raving , i blamed them all , the gods , the human race— what crueler blow did i feel the night that troy went down ?
true , zeus shrank from doing a thing to outrage rushing night
we charge them with drawn swords , calling out to the gods , to jove himself , to share our kill
hector finished stichius , finished arcesilaus off , the one a chief of boeotians armed in bronze , the other , brave menelaus ' trusty comrade
cloanthus who bred your line , you roman cluentius , sails the bright blue scylla
so giant ajax marched , that bulwark of the achaeans — a grim smile curling below his dark shaggy brows , under his legs ' power taking immense strides , shaking his spear high , its long shadow trailing
and there — meriones killed a trojan captain , laogonus , daring son of onetor , priest of zeus , idaean zeus , and his land revered him like a god — meriones gouged him under the jaw and ear , his spirit flew from his limbs and the hateful darkness gripped him
i ’ m to send you out alone into so much danger ?
hung from a shoulder , a bow that fit her grip , a huntress for all the world , she ’ d let her curls go streaming free in the wind , her knees were bare , her flowing skirts hitched up with a tight knot
squads forming around great ajax , king idomeneus , teucer , meriones and meges a match for ares closed tight for the onset , calling all their best to brace and face prince hector and hector 's trojans
— lord apollo the son of zeus replied — we will spur his nerve and strength , that breaker of horses , see if he will challenge one of the argives man-to-man and they will duel in bloody combat to the death
now juno made this plea to the lord of winds : aeolus , the father of gods and king of men gave you the power to calm the waves or rouse them with your gales
so now they went at the argives , out for blood , and furious for sarpedon hector swung them round
breakneck on , impelled by the sharp edge of fear , we shake our sheets out , spread our sails to the wind , wherever it may blow
then , for your sake , up i go to the bronze floor , the royal house of zeus — i will grasp his knees , i think i will win him over
and with that the red-haired captain moved ahead like an eagle scanning left and right , the bird men say has the sharpest eyes of all that fly the heavens : high as he soars he will never miss the racing hare cowering down low in the dense , shaggy brush — down on its head he swoops and pins it fast and rips its life away
he shared all roads and he braved all seas with me , all threats of the waves and skies—frail as he was but graced with a strength beyond his years , his lot
have you no pity for him , our helpless son ?
i will fling a spear myself and leave the rest to zeus
next the men who held mycenae 's huge walled citadel , corinth in all her wealth and sturdy , strong cleonae , men of orniae , lovely araethyrea and sicyon , adrastus ' domain before he ruled mycenae , men of hyperesia , gonoessa perched on hills , men who held pellene and those who circled aegion , men of the coastal strip and helice 's broad headland
a trumpet blast rings out from a mound midfield— let the games begin !
i will give you this mare i won — of my own accord
so come , dear father , climb up onto my shoulders !
giant ajax rose to his feet , the son of telamon , tall as a god , turned and broke his silence : ready , odysseus ?
so i will never live at the beck and call of zeus !
my mind steeled to relive the whole disaster , retrace my route through the whole city now and put my life in danger one more time
quick , take arms , pass out weapons , mount the walls , the enemy ’ s all but on us !
his aides , elated , lifted the armor off his shoulders
so you can see the breed of tros 's team , their flair for their own terrain as they gallop back and forth , one moment in flight , the next in hot pursuit
while high on olympus , diana called swift opis , one of her virgin comrades , one of her sacred troop , and the goddess spoke in tears : camilla ’ s moving out to a brutal war , dear girl , strapping on our armor all for nothing
and he pitched pisander off the chariot onto earth and plunged a spear in his chest — the man crashed on his back as hippolochus leapt away , but him he killed on the ground , slashing off his arms with a sword , lopping off his head and he sent him rolling through the carnage like a log
he was rich in bronze , rich in bars of gold , no feast for the eyes but lightning on his feet and an only son in the midst of five sisters
and they limp and halt , they are all wrinkled , drawn , they squint to the side , ca not look you in the eyes , and always bent on duty , trudging after ruin , maddening , blinding ruin
there on the ground it lay — he rushed to join it , pitching over the dead man 's body face-to-face , a world away from larissa 's dark rich soil
fighting words , and he hurls himself at the enemy ’ s massed ranks
defend your people now !
aeneas , barely sighting him grieving in the shadows , hailed him first : what god , palinurus , snatched you from our midst and drowned you in open waters ?
but now the queen , as soon as the pyre was built beneath the open sky , towering up with pitch-pine and cut logs of oak— deep in the heart of her house—she drapes the court with flowers , crowning the place with wreaths of death , and to top it off she lays his arms and the sword he left and an effigy of aeneas , all on the bed they ’ d shared , for well she knows the future
they came in a hundred ships and agamemnon led them on , atreus ' royal son , and marching in his companies came the most and bravest fighting men by far
i know , well i know — i am destined to die here , far from my dear father , far from mother
my sarpedon , the man i love the most , my own son — doomed to die at the hands of menoetius ' son patroclus
he trusted to courage , nerved for either end , to weave his lies or face his certain death
old nestor saw him at once and started up from his polished chair , warmly grasped his hand and led patroclus in , pressing him to sit
why can ’ t we clasp hands , embrace each other , exchange some words , speak out , and tell the truth ?
so off euchenor sailed , both to save his wealth from the heavy fine the argives made deserters pay and himself from wasting illness — no slow plague for him
hector 's escaped again , he 's risen from the dead !
a rousing appeal , and the father of men and gods looked down and smiled and took command with a flight of winging orders : excellent , hera
the tiber heard his prayer
hate and defense across it , assault to freeze the blood and right in their midst the gorgon 's monstrous head , that rippling dragon horror , sign of storming zeus
as far as a full shoulder-throw of a whirling discus hurled by a young contender testing out his strength , so far they raced dead even
grim death , that death assigned from the day that i was born has spread its hateful jaws to take me down
hector speared him now — the point split the collarbone , slashing through and out by the shoulder 's base , sticking out the back
and here , for those who chanced to long for a breathless foot-race now , aeneas stirs their spirits , setting out the prizes
i must say what i have to say straight out , must tell you how i feel and how all this will end — so you wo not crowd around me , one after another , coaxing like a murmuring clutch of doves
the last light calls the defeated
well i can boast my birth from powerful zeus himself !
a sound of grinding came from the fighter 's teeth , his eyes blazed forth in searing points of fire , unbearable grief came surging through his heart and now , bursting with rage against the men of troy , he donned hephaestus ' gifts — magnificent armor the god of fire forged with all his labor
what a price they ’ ll pay for the father and son-in-law ’ s alliance here !
the father of men and gods began to address them : you have come to olympus now , immortal thetis , for all your grief — what unforgettable sorrow seizes on your heart
menelaus yielded at once
the ranks shout out while their fathers weep and groan
that said , the thracian goddess , plucking a wind-swift shaft from her golden quiver , drew her bow with a vengeance , back to a full draw till the curved horns all but touched , her balanced hands tense—left hand at the iron point , right hand at the bowstring stretched to her breast— then , the instant that arruns heard the whizzing shaft and whirring air the iron struck home in his flesh
rushing him with his spear in a sudden surge tydides shouted , stop or i will run you through !
once more a new force , a new army threatens the walls of newborn troy
patroclus obeyed his great friend and off at a run he went along the ships and shelters
attendants run knives under throats and catch warm blood in bowls
— gripped by piercing rage
find him he did , standing by , flanked by the bands of shielded men who would trooped with him from the stallion-land of tricca
now sweeping toward this tree from a clear blue sky— a marvel , listen , a squadron of bees came buzzing to high heaven , swarmed in an instant , massed on the tree ’ s crown and hooking feet together , bent the laurel ’ s leafy branches down
but let him catch us lingering here tomorrow , just as he rises up in arms — there may be some who will sense his fighting spirit all too well
and that was the first we ’ d seen of cacus afraid , his eyes aswirl with terror—off to his cave he flees , swifter than any eastwind , yes , his feet were winged with fear
aeneas hurtles down on the latins—all-out assault— but we can deal out savage death to his trojans
we must be on our way !
just as surely as this scepter—raising the scepter he chanced to be grasping in his hand—will never sprout new green or scatter shade from its tender leaves , now that it ’ s been cut from its trunk ’ s base in the woods , cleft from its mother , its limbs and crowning foliage lost to the iron axe
not a single river failed to come , none apart from the ocean stream that holds the earth in place , nor a single nymph who haunts the rustling groves and the river springs and the lush , grassy meadows
and now nine years of almighty zeus have marched by , our ship timbers rot and the cables snap and fray and across the sea our wives and helpless children wait in the halls , wait for our return
and now , as soon as agenor saw achilles coming , there he stood , poised for the scourge of cities while the heart inside him heaved like heavy seas
i will never beg you to stay , not on my account
and back to the lines he leapt and urged each man , no more standing back from the trojans , brave achaeans !
over his corpse no letup , the fighters kept on thrusting whetted spears , locked in endless struggle , cutting each other down
i launched out on the phrygian sea with twenty ships , my goddess mother marking the way , and followed hard on the course the fates had charted
do not stir my raging heart still more
the words were still on his lips when , look , saces , riding his lathered horse through enemy lines and slashed where an arrow raked his face , comes racing up , calling for help , crying the name of turnus : turnus , you are our last best hope !
the true ghost of her husband , not yet buried , came and lifting his face—ashen , awesome in death— showed her the cruel altar , the wounds that pierced his chest and exposed the secret horror that lurked within the house
we will fight again — i will finish you off next time if one of the gods will only urge me on as well
the trojans were moved to tears , handsome iulus the most of all
let the order i issue now stand firm and clear and the stirring call to arms i sound tomorrow morning , my stallion-breaking trojans !
amok as mars by the banks of the hebrus frozen over— splattered with blood , fired to fury , drumming his shield as he whips up war and gives his frenzied team free rein and over the open fields they outstrip the winds from south and west till the far frontiers of thrace groan to their pounding hoofs and round him the shapes of black fear , rage and ambush , aides of the war-god gallop on and on
the giant was helpless to rip it off his back
they ’ ll rush to the rescue now from every side— i ’ ll sow their fields with swords !
for turnus to plant his feet on his own native soil ?
the stars were extinguished , the high skies black , the luminous heavens blotted out by a thick cloud cover , the dead of night had wrapped the moon in mist
but once i have stripped your glorious armor , achilles , i will give your body back to your loyal comrades
brave diomedes killed him off , twelve of his cohorts too , all men of rank
then the salii , dancing priests of mars , come clustering , leaping round the flaming altars , raising the chorus , brows wreathed with poplar : here a troupe of boys and a troupe of old men there , singing hercules ’ praises , all his heroic feats
and zeus pitied them , watching their tears flow
until he makes you his wedded wife — that or his slave
both fighters sprang from their chariots , clasped each other 's hands and traded pacts of friendship
as fresh as i was that time the feud broke out
they promptly obeyed and priam climbed aboard , pulling the reins back taut
like a snake caught , as they often are , on a causeway , crushed by a bronze wheel or heavy rock flung by a traveler—trampled , left half-dead , trying to slip away , writhing in gnarled coils , no hope
there fate holds out a homeland , calm , at peace
full battalions hang on your words , agamemnon — look at the countless loyal fighters you command !
no matter , i beg you for their sakes , loved ones far away — now stand and fight , no turning back , no panic
this was the hour when rest , that gift of the gods most heaven-sent , first comes to beleaguered mortals , creeping over us now
ah for a young man all looks fine and noble if he goes down in war , hacked to pieces under a slashing bronze blade — he lies there dead
i am cold with fear — what if they have met the worst , our ranking argives killed in a trojan charge ?
men who fought at a distance worked with frequent breaks , dodging painful arrows that showered side-to-side
once they would appealed to zeus 's mighty daughter , into the black night they went like two lions stalking through the carnage and the corpses , through piles of armor and black pools of blood
once their spirits calmed and the anxious din died down , first the king salutes the gods from his high throne and then begins : if only before now , men of latium , we had resolved this dire crisis !
and when they would frisk on the tilled fields ripe with grain they would brush the crests of the corn and never snap a stalk , but when they would frisk and vault on the sea 's broad back they would skim the crests of whitecaps glistening foam
he had barely closed and anchises ’ son , aeneas , and trusty achates , their eyes fixed on the ground , would long have worried deep in their anxious hearts if venus had not given a sign from the cloudless sky
but soon her father , the holy priest of apollo the distant deadly archer , chryses approached the fast trim ships of the argives armed in bronze to win his daughter back , bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand , wound on a golden staff , the wreaths of the god who strikes from worlds away
the old man was terrified
on i go and again i see the palace of priam set on the heights , but there in colonnades deserted now , in the sanctuary of juno , there stand the elite watchmen , phoenix , ruthless ulysses guarding all their loot
one daughter alone was left to preserve the house and royal line— ripe for marriage now , a full-grown woman now
how noble his face , his courage , and what a soldier !
then onto the flaming chariot pallas set her feet and seized her spear — weighted , heavy , the massive shaft she wields to break the battle lines of heroes the mighty father 's daughter storms against
you must have something better than this to say
and so we lay his soul in the grave as our voices raise his name , the resounding last farewell
i ca not even hear the battle cry of agamemnon break from his hated skull
rushing to meet him came camilla , riding up with her armed volscian ranks and under the gates the princess sprang from her horse , and following suit her entire troop dismounted in one gliding flow as their captain speaks out : turnus , if the brave deserve to trust themselves , i ’ m steeled , i swear , to engage the cavalry of aeneas , foray out alone to confront the tuscan squadrons
so they clashed and fought like living , breathing men grappling each other 's corpses , dragging off the dead
so complex the labyrinth once in hilly crete , they say , where the passage wove between blind walls and wavered on in numberless cunning paths that broke down every clue , with nothing to trace and no way back—a baffling maze
and my dear mother told me i must not arm for battle , not till i see her coming back with my own eyes — she vowed to bring me burnished arms from the god of fire
he reined them back in the ring with drenching sweat , lather streaming down to the ground from necks and chests
i care nothing for that
and here in the heart of the shield : the bronze ships , the battle of actium , you could see it all , the world drawn up for war , leucata headland seething , the breakers molten gold
i never dreamed these heroic argive ranks could hold back our charge , our invincible arms
you are the one whose age and breed the fates approve , the one the powers call
not overly tired , i trust , from all your efforts there in glorious battle , slaughtering trojans , the men you break with all your deathless rage
killed by the war-god , never sated — a boy fighting the solymi always out for glory
the crew springs up , shouting , trying to backwater , unshipping their iron pikes and sharp-tipped punting poles , they scramble to rescue splintered oars from the surf
here in all this carnage the god of fire forged her pale with imminent death , sped on by the tides and northwest wind
that 's what it is , and it will be unbearable if the two of you must come to blows this way , flinging the gods in chaos just for mortal men
here this aeneas , born of trojan blood , has arrived in carthage , and lovely dido deigns to join the man in wedlock
now his loving sister , juturna , spurs her brother turnus quickly to lausus ’ side
not if he gave me ten times as much , twenty times over , all he possesses now , and all that could pour in from the world 's end — not all the wealth that 's freighted into orchomenos , even into thebes , egyptian thebes where the houses overflow with the greatest troves of treasure , thebes with the hundred gates and through each gate battalions , two hundred fighters surge to war with teams and chariots — no , not if his gifts outnumbered all the grains of sand and dust in the earth — no , not even then could agamemnon bring my fighting spirit round until he pays me back , pays full measure for all his heartbreaking outrage !
and aeneas himself lines up his walls with a shallow trench , he starts to work the site and rings his first settlement on the coast with mounds , redoubts and ramparts built like an armed camp
and out of the world of darkness a fury heard her cries , stalking the night with a fury 's brutal heart , and suddenly — thunder breaking around the gates , the roar of enemies , towers battered under assault
even then the awesome dread of the place struck fear in the hearts of rustics , even then they trembled before the woodland and the rock
if any power on high recoils at such an outrage , let the gods repay you for all your reckless work , grant you the thanks , the rich reward you ’ ve earned
and rising over it now the champion ’ s voice comes pouring from his heart : here , eryx , i pay your spirit a better life than dares ’ !
this fortress built by father janus , that by saturn : this was called the janiculum , that , saturnia
tell us what you trust to , such a willing captive
but soon as the gash dried and firm clots formed , sharp pain came bursting in on atrides ' strength — spear-sharp as the labor-pangs that pierce a woman , agonies brought on by the harsh , birthing spirits , hera 's daughters who hold the stabbing power of birth — so sharp the throes that burst on atrides ' strength
here as she handed down decrees and laws to her people , sharing labors fairly , some by lot , some with her sense of justice , aeneas suddenly sees his men approaching through the crowds , antheus , sergestus , gallant cloanthus , other trojans the black gales had battered over the seas and swept to far-flung coasts
and now the spear-throwers rose up to compete , atrides agamemnon , lord of the far-flung kingdoms , flanked by idomeneus ' rough-and-ready aide meriones but the swift runner achilles interceded at once : atrides — well we know how far you excel us all : no one can match your strength at throwing spears , you are the best by far !
let me rest in the grave beside my son , in the comradeship of death
but over against them glorious hector ranged his trojans
all vessels beached on the front along the shore — haul them down and row them out on the bright sea , ride them over the anchor-stones in the offshore swell till the bracing godsent night comes down and then , if the trojans will refrain from war at night , we haul down all the rest
thoughts racing , here , there , probing his options , turning to this plan , that plan—torn in two until , at his wits ’ end , this answer seems the best
but there , far off on a lonely stretch of beach the trojan women wept for the lost anchises
what were our chances now , at this point ?
i tell you now—so you won ’ t think me an empty dream— that under an oak along the banks you ’ ll find a great sow stretched on her side with thirty pigs just farrowed , a snow-white mother with snow-white young at her dugs
his prayer went up and phoebus apollo heard him
so go for the argives — head-on !
mad for a fight , he challenged all our bravest
my team stands at the foot of ida with all her springs , they wait to bear me over the good dry land and sea
athena laughed aloud , glorying over him , winging insults : colossal fool — it never even occurred to you , not even now when you matched your strength with mine , just how much greater i claim to be than you !
first came saturn , down from the heights of heaven , fleeing jove in arms : saturn robbed of his kingdom , exiled
while they see to their meal aeneas scales a crag , straining to scan the sea-reach far and wide
terrified by their father 's rough commands the sons trundled a mule-wagon out at once , a good smooth-running one , newly finished , balanced and bolted tight , and strapped a big wicker cradle across its frame
our prince of beauty — mad for women , you lure them all to ruin !
god of the silver bow who strides the walls of chryse and cilia sacrosanct — lord in power of tenedos — smintheus , god of the plague !
but come , tell me , eurypylus , royal fighter , can the achaeans , somehow , still hold monstrous hector ?
now for flying hands !
it 's not some lifeless fear that paralyzes me now , no flinching from combat either
but when the tenth dawn brought light to the mortal world they carried gallant hector forth , weeping tears , and they placed his corpse aloft the pyre 's crest , flung a torch and set it all aflame
let lavinia go to him—his bride !
with that welcome , a wreath of poplar , hung with a poplar garland ’ s green and silver sheen that shaded hercules once , shaded evander ’ s hair and crowned his head and the sacred wooden winecup filled his hand
aeneas , spotting him out in the long front ranks , comes up to cross his path
by night she flies aloft , between the earth and sky , whirring across the dark , never closing her lids in soothing sleep
to what extremes won ’ t you compel our hearts ?
but aeneas , no less struck by her unjust fate , escorts her from afar with streaming tears and pities her as she passes
the strain is far too great
no embrace in his halls from the old horseman peleus nor from mother , thetis — this alien earth i stride will hold me down at last
the achaeans were furious with him , deeply offended
so home we sail
who has sped you here to me , swooping down from the clouds to reach the earth ?
where are you rushing ?
soon as he noticed glaucus slipping clear , the pain overcame sarpedon but even so he never forgot his lust for battle
off and away to other grand , luxurious cities , out to phrygia , out to maeonia 's tempting country ?
dear gods , do not bring to pass the grief that haunts my heart — the prophecy that mother revealed to me one time
idaeus leapt , abandoned the handsome car but did not dare to stand and defend his dead brother — and not even so would he have fled his black death but the god of fire swept him off and saved him , shrouding the man in night so the old priest would not be wholly crushed with one son left
but if the trojans call me to single combat , if that ’ s your will as well , and i am such a bar to the public good , then victory has not spurned or so hated these hands of mine that i would shrink from any risk when hopes are riding high
he 's sound of limb
well , no hope now of seeing the land where i was born or my sweet children , the father i longed for all these years
soothing words , and with both her hands dione gently wiped the ichor from aphrodite 's arm and her wrist healed at once , her stark pain ebbed away
achilles gave the bronze-shod spear to meriones
the sweat was streaming down his face and back and the dark blood still flowed from his ugly wound but the man 's will was firm , he never broke his stride
that man has got no heart in him , not a pulsebeat
but you , you are all frightened out of your minds — you can not fight
twelve beaked ships sailed out in his command , trim vessels he left behind him in percote , making his way to troy to fight on foot and here he came now , up against agamemnon , closer , closing
down in the dust the war-gear tumbled , all still glistening bright in its fresh purple dye but the man stood his ground , still rearing to fight , his hopes still soaring for triumph
they traded many questions , wondering , back and forth , what dead friend did the sibyl mean , whose body must be buried ?
then , keen to marry a spartan bride , hermione , granddaughter of leda , he turned me over to helenus , slave to slave
here we are , under your roof , sent from the whole achaean force !
and athena left him there , caught up with hector at once , and taking the build and vibrant voice of deiphobus stood shoulder-to-shoulder with him , winging orders : dear brother , how brutally swift achilles hunts you — coursing you round the city of priam in all his lethal speed !
you ca not kill me — i can never die — it 's not my fate !
and mulius next — he reared and jammed his lance through the man 's ear so the lance came jutting out through the other ear , bronze point glinting
ah if the two of us could ever think as one , troy could delay her day of death no longer , not one moment
some news for the myrmidons , news for me ?
with that he began to don his handsome gear
they keep on coming now , huddling beside me , making plans for battle — it 's their duty
as hard at their tasks as bees in early summer , that work the blooming meadows under the sun , they escort a new brood out , young adults now , or press the oozing honey into the combs , the nectar brimming the bulging cells , or gather up the plunder workers haul back in , or close ranks like an army , driving the drones , that lazy crew , from home
but euaemon 's shining son eurypylus saw him overwhelmed by the trojans ' dense barrage of spears
he gorges himself on the innards and black blood of all his wretched victims
simois , xanthus , a greek camp—you ’ ll never lack them here
my courage — mine was the first you mocked among the argives , branding me a coward , a poor soldier
their morale was low but the men laughed now , good hearty laughter breaking over thersites ' head — glancing at neighbors they would shout , a terrific stroke !
just then aeneas hurled his brazen spear at meriones , hoping to hit the man as he charged behind his shield
terrified , true , but glaring still , ferocious still as he backs away , but his heart , his fury keep him from turning tail , yet for all his wild desire he still can ’ t claw his way through spears and huntsmen
with a sudden , killing look he wheeled on calchas first : seer of misery !
father anchises cries out : surely that ’ s charybdis , those the cliffs that helenus warned of , craggy deathtraps
as fresh as i was that time i first set out from hellas where the women are a wonder , fleeing a blood feud with my father , amyntor , ormenus ' son
whoever defiled your body with that wound will pay with the death that he deserves !
as for the fighting , men will see to that , all who were born in troy but i most of all
with that he stopped in his tracks , watching keenly— what sign would they offer ?
he told him to show them to antea 's father : that would mean his death
we invite two men — our best — to compete for these
think how dogs and huntsmen off in the wilds rush some antlered stag or skittish mountain goat but a rocky gorge or shadowed forest gives him shelter — they see it 's not their lot to bring that quarry down , their shouting only flushes a great bearded lion ramping across their path , suddenly charging them , scattering men and packs despite their lust for battle — so up till now the achaeans kept advancing , close formation , stabbing away with swords and rugged two-edged spears but once they saw tall hector attack the ranks again they wheeled in terror — hearts collapsed at their heels
but apollo lord of the silver bow kept watch
whatever the gods give of their own free will — how could we ever choose them for ourselves ?
we cleanse ourselves with the rites we owe to jove and make the altars blaze with votive gifts , then crowd the actian shore with trojan games
but soon as magnificent paris marked atrides shining among the champions , paris ' spirit shook
we ’ ve made the long march and survived its many dangers— we have grasped the hand that toppled troy
but lausus , who plays a front-line role in war , won ’ t let his soldiers flinch at pallas ’ carnage
won over at last , my father rises to his full height and prays to the gods and reveres that holy star : no more delay , not now !
now old entellus ’ voice comes rising from his chest : what if you ’ d seen the gloves of hercules himself and the grim fight he fought on these very sands ?
the rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship
so antilochus turned and ran as a savage cry went up and hector and all his trojans showered deadly shafts in hot pursuit , but he wheeled and stood his ground when he reached his thronging cohorts
down to you i go , a spirit cleansed , utterly innocent as charged , forever worthy of my great fathers ’ fame !
here the god of cyllene landed first , banking down to a stop on balanced wings
the more he gazed , the deeper his anger went , his eyes flashing under his eyelids , fierce as fire — exulting , holding the god 's shining gifts in his hands
there — quick oilean ajax rushed cleobulus , took him alive , stumbling blind in the rout but took his life at once , snapped his strength with a sword that hewed his neckbone — up to the hilt so the whole blade ran hot with blood , and red death came flooding down his eyes , and the strong force of fate
whatever is right for you to hear , no one , trust me , will know of it before you , neither god nor man
and the breakneck runner only paused to answer , so be it , scamander sprung of zeus — as you command
together they sailed from troy over windswept seas and a southern gale sprang up and toppling breakers crushed their ships and crews
now , with his rage inflamed for his friend 's death , i fear he will raze the walls against the will of fate
so his whole head was dragged down in the dust
fight to save your king the marauder seized !
but i — dear god , my life so cursed by fate !
as the east and south winds fight in killer-squalls deep in a mountain valley thrashing stands of timber , oak and ash and cornel with bark stretched taut and hard and they whip their long sharp branches against each other , a deafening roar goes up , the splintered timber crashing — so achaeans and trojans crashed , hacking into each other , and neither side now had a thought of flight that would have meant disaster
the ones you want to win
no , command them now to take their food and wine by the fast ships — a soldier 's strength and nerve
he prays the gods for peace , he looses the sacred ribbons round his hallowed head and taking me by the hand he leads me to your shrine , apollo , stirred with awe by your vibrant power , and at once this prophecy comes singing from the priest ’ s inspired lips : son of the goddess , surely proof is clear , the highest sanctions shine upon your voyage
so we can come to terms by the deep-sea ships and strike our marriage pact — you will find our price for brides not quite so killing !
yours , the shame will be yours if your comrade 's corpse goes down to the dead defiled !
he ’ d barely finished when there , up on a ridge we saw him , polyphemus !
and deep in his sturdy well-built lodge achilles slept with briseis in all her beauty sleeping by his side
what wild desire brings you here from olympus ?
you race to defend a city already lost in flames
so the king of the gods has sorted out your fate , so rolls your life , as the world rolls through its changes
they steal on a city buried deep in sleep and wine , they butcher the guards , fling wide the gates and hug their cohorts poised to combine forces
their hard campaigning just might come to grief
aeneas straddled the body — proud in his fighting power like some lion — shielded the corpse with spear and round buckler , burning to kill off any man who met him face-to-face and he loosed a bloodcurdling cry
and an argive armed in bronze would call out , friends !
so he cried but antilochus drove on all the wilder , cracking his lash for more speed like a man stone deaf
the daughter of trim-heeled marpessa , euenus ' child , and her husband idas , strongest man of the men who once walked the earth — he even braved apollo , he drew his bow at the archer , all for marpessa the girl with lovely ankles
here is a heart that spurns the light , that counts the honor you ’ re after cheap at the price of life !
take me with you over the waves
again , in a deep recess under rocky cliffs , [ screened around by trees and trembling shade , ] we deck our tables out , relight the altar-fire but again , from some new height , some hidden nest the rout comes screaming at their quarry , flapping round us , slashing with claw-feet , hook-beaks fouling our meal
one after another pressed them with questions , king agamemnon most urgent of all : come — tell me , famous odysseus , achaea 's pride and glory — will he fight the fire off the ships ?
here i saw it—our first omen : four horses , snow-white , cropping the grasslands far and wide
and with one accord the trojans murmured yes
so we can seize the shield of nestor — its fame hits the skies , solid gold , the handgrips and the shield itself — and strip from the stallion-breaking diomedes ' back the burnished armor hephaestus forged with all his skill
they waste no time , moving out on command , setting a brisk pace
so till the sun bestrode the sky at high noon the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
his mother ’ s birds— the great captain knew them and raised a prayer of joy : be my guides !
seeing their grief the father , filled with pity , quickly turned to athena with winging words : my child , have you abandoned him forever ?
but one thing more
at last one strategy struck her mind as best : she would dress in all her glory and go to ida — perhaps the old desire would overwhelm the king to lie by her naked body and make immortal love and she might drift an oblivious , soft warm sleep across his eyes and numb that seething brain
for you never died in bed and stretched your arms to me or said some last word from the heart i can remember , always , weeping for you through all my nights and days !
and on that resolve he drew the whetted sword that hung at his side , tempered , massive , and gathering all his force he swooped like a soaring eagle launching down from the dark clouds to earth to snatch some helpless lamb or trembling hare
no one could underrate these gifts of yours , not now , the treasure trove you offer prince achilles
but drawing his sharp sword , achilles charged , wild , hurtling toward him , loosing a savage cry as aeneas hefted a boulder in his hands , a tremendous feat — no two men could hoist it , weak as men are now , but all on his own he raised it high with ease
but the swift runner achilles broke in sharply — field marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , produce the gifts if you like , as you see fit , or keep them back , it 's up to you
children and trembling mothers rounded up in a long , endless line
but best by far of the men was telamonian ajax while achilles raged apart
hurl him headlong down , sprawled at our high gates !
meriones carried off the double-axes , all ten , teucer took the singles back to his hollow ships
as firm as a sturdy oak grown tough with age when the northwinds blasting off the alps compete , fighting left and right , to wrench it from the earth , and the winds scream , the trunk shudders , its leafy crest showers across the ground but it clings firm to its rock , its roots stretching as deep into the dark world below as its crown goes towering toward the gales of heaven— so firm the hero stands : buffeted left and right by storms of appeals , he takes the full force of love and suffering deep in his great heart
nothing , my friend , priam ’ s son replies , you have left nothing undone
no , the rudder i clung to , holding us all on course—my charge— some powerful force ripped it away by chance and i dragged it down as i dropped headlong too
he 's fasting , never fed
too mighty , the roman race , it seemed to you above , if this grand gift should last
no , nisus insisted , i had no such qualm about you— how wrong i ’ d be
come , up you go in our chariot , give ground now !
why , it would have been fairer for turnus to meet this death !
whirling words—i was swept away by fury now ] when all of a sudden there my loving mother stood before my eyes , but i had never seen her so clearly , her pure radiance shining down upon me through the night , the goddess in all her glory , just as the gods behold her build , her awesome beauty
on the tenth achilles called all ranks to muster — the impulse seized him , sent by white-armed hera grieving to see achaean fighters drop and die
i shall never deny what you deserve , my queen , never regret my memories of dido , not while i can recall myself and draw the breath of life
and here he sees deiphobus too , priam ’ s son mutilated , his whole body , his face hacked to pieces— ah , so cruel—his face and both his hands , and his ears ripped from his ravaged head , his nostrils slashed , disgraceful wound
come , we will swear to the gods , the highest witnesses — the gods will oversee our binding pacts
leaving priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen of argos , helen for whom so many argives lost their lives in troy , far from native land
not if she rivaled aphrodite in all her golden glory , not if she matched the crafts of clear-eyed athena , not even then would i make her my wife !
look , plenty of trojans there for me to kill , your famous allies too , any soldier the god will bring in range or i can run to ground
let us put our griefs to rest in our own hearts , rake them up no more , raw as we are with mourning
the king denies you your bride , denies you your dowry earned in blood , he seeks a stranger as heir to his royal throne
and it 's just twelve days that i have been home in troy — all i have suffered !
they come to their senses , know their people , and juno is driven from their hearts
she began to bear her dear son from the fighting
you are the younger-born , and i — it 's wrong for me , since i have years on you and i know the world much better
brothers-in-arms of peleus ' son achilles !
then in the thick of the din , suddenly , look , a messenger rushes in through the royal palace , spreading panic across the city : armies marching !
how shameful — and now the rest of our men-at-arms must harbor anger against me deep inside their hearts , just like achilles
and here comes pallas ’ warhorse , blaze , regalia set aside , weeping , ambling on , big tears rivering down his face
now you can not bring yourselves to save him — even his corpse — so his wife can see him , his mother and his child , his father priam and priam 's people : how they would rush to burn his body on the pyre and give him royal rites !
both gods were enraged at niobe
like powerful stallions sweeping round the post for trophies , galloping full stretch with some fine prize at stake , a tripod , say , or woman offered up at funeral games for some brave hero fallen — so the two of them whirled three times around the city of priam , sprinting at top speed while all the gods gazed down , and the father of men and gods broke forth among them now : unbearable — a man i love , hunted round his own city walls and right before my eyes
just then aeneas hurries in with his trojan troops but the women , terrified , scatter down the beaches , fleeing , stealing away into woods and rocky caverns , anywhere they can hide
who can make a song of slaughter in all its forms— the deaths of captains down the entire field , dealt now by turnus , now by aeneas , kill for kill ?
down you dive from the high skies , opis my nymph , light out for the latin lands where battle flares and the omens all are bad
the rutulians spring up with a groan and the hillsides round groan back and the tall groves far and wide resound with the long-drawn moan
aeneas cuts his way to the waiting ships to see his crews again , then sets a course straight on to caieta ’ s harbor
let no one hold back now , waiting further summons — these are your summons : pain and death to the man who skulks beside the ships !
putting the mass of horse and men behind him dolon picked up speed , hot for action now , but keen as a god odysseus saw him coming and alerted diomedes : who is this ?
but you see that pair of spirits ?
no , such pride , such violence has no place in the hearts of beaten men
and now they approach diana ’ s sacred grove and walk beneath the golden roofs of god
but you , hector , you go back to the city , tell our mother to gather all the older noble women together in gray-eyed athena 's shrine on the city 's crest , unlock the doors of the goddess ' sacred chamber — and take a robe , the largest , loveliest robe that she can find throughout the royal halls , a gift that far and away she prizes most herself , and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess ' knees
he dragged them up on the banks , dazed like fawns , lashed their hands behind them with well-cut straps — their own belts that cinched their billowing war-shirts — gave them to friends to lead away to the beaked ships and back he whirled , insane to hack more flesh
no herald of doom , i come on a friendly mission — i come with all good will
then they renew their strength with food , stretched out on the beachgrass , fill themselves with seasoned wine and venison rich and crisp
halting near she gave achilles a flight of marching orders : to arms — son of peleus !
and once the god has led him within the fighter 's shelter , achilles will not kill him — he will hold back all the rest : achilles is no madman , no reckless fool , not the one to defy the gods ' commands
meanwhile the argives blocked the trojan assault but they still could not repel them from the fleet , outnumbering them as they did
now ’ s the time for horse and chariot
calling so , he rakes the slumbering coals to worship the household god of troy and the sacred shrine of white-haired vesta , offering up a suppliant ’ s hallowed meal , and mist from an overflowing censer
remind him of that , now , go and sit beside him , grasp his knees
but blazing achilles strained to engage prince hector , plunge in battle with him beyond all others — achilles yearning now to glut with hector 's blood , his , no other , ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield
you will see your promised city , see lavinium ’ s walls and bear your great-hearted aeneas up to the stars on high
yes , down like a lurid rainbow zeus sends arching down to mortal men from the high skies , a sign of war or blizzard to freeze the summer 's warmth and put a halt to men 's work on the face of the earth and harry flocks — so shrouded round in a lurid cloud came pallas now and dove in the argive ranks to fire up each man
but nestor the noble charioteer replied at length , now why is achilles so cast down with grief for this or that achaean winged by a stray shaft ?
next he displays the grand grove that heroic romulus restored as a refuge—the asylum—then shows him , under its chilly rock , the grotto called the lupercal , in the old arcadian way , pan of mount lycaeus
the rest attack with me where i command !
by chance apollo , god of the flowing hair enthroned on a cloud in the broad sweeping sky , was glancing down at ausonia ’ s troops and camp and calls to iulus flushed with triumph now : bravo , my boy , bravo , your newborn courage !
who will lead the herd ? — while the bulls battle it out , horns butting , locking , goring each other , necks and shoulders roped in blood and the woods resound as they grunt and bellow out
but you , with your saffron braided dress , your flashy purple , you live for lazing , lost in your dancing , your delight , blowzy sleeves on your war-shirts , ribbons on bonnets
working it out , his heart racing as on they came , waves of trojan soldiers and hector led them in
aeneas gives a groan , heaving up from his depths , he sees the plundered armor , the car , the corpse of his great friend , and priam reaching out with helpless hands
odysseus struck democoon , priam 's bastard son come down from abydos , priam 's racing-stables
you ’ re up against superhuman power , can ’ t you see ?
but turnus ’ hot fury , his mad lust for carnage drives him against his foes
but with hera , though , i am not so outraged , so irate — it 's always her way to thwart my will , whatever i command
but you , menelaus , the blessed deathless gods did not forget you , zeus 's daughter the queen of fighters first of all
so raging turnus runs for it , scours the field , now here , now there , weaving in tangled circles as trojans crowd him hard , a dense ring of them shutting him in , with a wild swamp to the left and steep walls to the right
so their cries urged on the achaeans ' war-lust
a thousand fires were burning there on the plain and beside each fire sat fifty fighting men poised in the leaping blaze , and champing oats and glistening barley , stationed by their chariots , stallions waited for dawn to mount her glowing throne
freshening breezes blow as night comes on and a full moon speeds their course , its dancing light strikes sparkles off the waves
bury our dead , with tears for the day they die , not one day more
so come , follow old nautes ’ good sound advice : choose your elite troops , your bravest hearts , and sail them on to italy
achilles , startled , sprang to his feet , the lyre still in his hands , leaving the seat where he had sat in peace
he had no spear in reserve
now both armies come to a halt before the city , building dikes to fortify their camps
what does he long to gain , if luck is on his side , from open warfare ?
pity your mother too , if i ever gave you the breast to soothe your troubles , remember it now , dear boy — beat back that savage man from safe inside the walls !
then prince achilles stood and addressed the argives keen for battle : father zeus — great are the blinding frenzies you deal out to men !
is that what you are turning over in your mind , my glorious one , achilles ?
catching sight of a third fighter , ajax , the old king asked her next , who 's that other achaean , so powerful , so well-built ?
he spread the gates at once , slid back the bars and ushered priam in with his wagon-load of treasure
but the noble horseman nestor shouted back , nonsense , steady tydeus ' son — such loose talk !
the old man cried , pitifully , hands reaching out to him , oh hector !
you came third , and all you could do was finish off my life
so handing his gear to a loyal aide laodocus , who maneuvered his pawing horses close by , he set off at a run
bellerophon 's bent on dragging me down with him in lust though i fight him all the way !
no charging the front ranks — you might lose your life
then she made her way with a file of noble women rushing in her train
so now , each of you , turn straight for the enemy , live or die — that is the lovely give-and-take of war
the seer rose to the moment : famous captain of troy , no pure soul may set foot on that wicked threshold
these , these are the gifts we claim — they are our rights
our goddess of love — i would swear she 's just been rousing another argive , another beauty to pant and lust for trojans , those men the goddess loves to such despair
across the entire field the snorting chargers stamping , fighting their tight reins and veering left and right and the plains are bristling a jagged crop of iron spears , everywhere , fields ablaze with weapons brandished high
even those who would kept to the beached ships till now , the helmsmen who handled the heavy steering-oars and stewards left on board to deal out rations — even they trooped to the muster : great achilles who held back from the brutal fighting so long had just come blazing forth
shedding his wings he masquerades as iulus , prancing with his stride
to the right it runs below the mighty walls of death , our path to elysium , but the left-hand road torments the wicked , leading down to tartarus , path to doom
such vistas the god of fire forged across the shield that venus gives her son
what an indignity for us to clash in arms
i will speak out what the heart inside me urges
so with the spear patroclus gaffed him off his car , his mouth gaping round the glittering point and flipped him down facefirst , dead as he fell , his life breath blown away
always your pleasure , whenever my back is turned , to settle things in your grand clandestine way
will no one rush to arms , come streaming out of the whole city , hunt him down , race to the docks and launch the ships ?
hear me , turn your power my way , attend my sorrows— i deserve your mercy—hear my prayers !
seeing him there the swift achilles filled with pity , rose in their midst and said these winging words : the best man drives his purebred team home last !
what could light such a conflagration ?
but cronus ' son , zeus with his shield of storm insists on embroiling me in painful struggles , futile wars of words
disaster seized him — his fine legs buckling — he stood there , senseless — and now , right at his back , close-up , a dardan fighter speared him squarely between the shoulder blades with a sharp lance
immortal horses they are , poseidon gave them himself to my father peleus , peleus passed them on to me
you will learn too , in tears — easier game you will be for argive troops to slaughter , now my hector 's dead
and come , my people , celebrate with all good will this feast that makes us one !
and once they ’ d devoured all in sight , still not sated , their hunger drove them on to attack the fateful plates themselves , their hands and teeth defiling , ripping into the thin dry crusts , never sparing a crumb of the flat-bread scored in quarters
you keep your family mourners near to cart you off — once my fists have worked you down to pulp !
the other gods kept clear , at their royal ease , reclining off in the halls where the roofs of each were built for the ages high on rugged ridged olympus
god save our earth from such a scourge !
aides caught his team , sthenelus , loyal eurymedon , as the two commanders boarded diomedes ' car
he kept his watch , enthralled by the rush of battle , aloft the summit of timbered samos facing thrace
now , suddenly , battle thrilled them more than the journey home , than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land
with one accord the trojans roared assent : give the man the prize that he ’ d been promised
oh make me young again , and the strength inside me steady as a rock !
trusting these , they followed their chief to troy , shooting with these , salvo on pelting salvo , they tore the trojan battle lines to pieces
while i in our cursed bridal chamber , there i lay , bone-weary with anguish , buried deep in sleep , peaceful , sweet , like the peace of death itself
you are eager for bed now , burning to make love , here on ida 's heights for all the world to see ?
but the whole plain filled with men and flashed with bronze , with troops and horse and beneath their feet the earth quaked as armies rushed together
zeus saved you then and other gods joined in
look on us kindly , see the state we are in
never a word that works to my advantage !
at once aeneas invites all those who wish to contend with winging shafts and names the prizes
idomeneus called his comrades , glancing fast at ascalaphus , aphareus , deipyrus , meriones and antilochus , both strong with the war cry — he called them closer , his winging orders flying : over here , my friends !
but no , it was not the gallant odysseus ' fate to finish zeus 's rugged son with his sharp bronze , so pallas swung his fury against the lycian front
turnus begs you with all his heart , dash this ship on a reef or cliff or run her aground on the syrtes ’ savage shoals where no rutulian , no rumor that knows my shame can dog my heels !
so the herald shouted , stirring machaon 's spirit
something to shield and save our men and ships since zeus 's heart has turned — his mighty heart is set on hector 's offerings more than ours
my blood runs cold , my body ’ s chill , played out
so , exceeding our hopes , we win our way to solid ground at last
here is the man , he ’ s here !
mothers struck with terror pray and re-echo prayers , the fear builds as the deadly peril comes closer , the specter of war looms larger , ever larger
he tried to hoist great ajax , budged him a little off the ground , true , but he could not heave him clear , then hooked him round a knee and down they sprawled together , both men clenched in a death-lock , tussling round in dust
while they consecrated the tomb with various games , saturnian juno hurries iris down from the sky to the trojan fleet , breathing gusts at her back to wing her on her way
hovering at his head the phantom rose and spoke : sleeping , achilles ?
he stopped the pains at once , stanched the dark blood in his throbbing wound and filled his heart with courage
he calls for his horse , his pride , his mainstay , always the mount he rode triumphant from every battle
but the shrewd tactician kept on pressing : be precise
reveal the will of god , whatever you may know
but against them zeus impelled the trojan ranks as menelaus lord of the war cry urged antilochus , none of the younger troops , antilochus , none is faster of foot than you or tougher in combat — why not leap right in and lay some trojan out ?
the crowd cheered on both , they took both sides , but heralds held them back as the city elders sat on polished stone benches , forming the sacred circle , grasping in hand the staffs of clear-voiced heralds , and each leapt to his feet to plead the case in turn
the veteran pelagon , one of his closest aides , pushed the shaft of ashwood out through his wound — his spirit left him — a mist poured down his eyes
there the father of men and gods reined in his team , set them free and around them poured a dense mist
but you — the son of cronus with cronus ' twisting ways gave you gifts by halves : with that royal scepter the father gave you honor beyond all other men alive but he never gave you courage , the greatest power of all
cebriones followed close , third in command since hector left another to rein his team , a driver less than cebriones , less a fighter
when a man stands up to speak , it 's well to listen
and zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied , courage , athena , third-born of the gods , dear child
leaving a few behind , we launch out from crete , deserting another home , and set our sails again , scudding on buoyant hulls through wastes of ocean
savage allecto , high on a lookout , spots her chance to wreak some havoc
and all the while that matchless wife of mine is removing all my weapons from the house , even slipping my trusty sword from under my pillow
this one volunteered among the trojans : hector , the mission stirs my fighting blood — i will reconnoiter the ships and gather all i can
there , a total stranger , the horseman tydeus had no fear , alone in the midst of theban hordes
ajax next — with a lunge he stabbed phorcys , phaenops ' warrior son bestriding hippothous ' corpse — he ripped his belly , smashing the corslet just where the plates join and the bronze spearhead spilled his entrails out and down went phorcys , grasping , clawing the dust
quick in the jolting onset lycia 's captain glaucus son of hippolochus skewered dexius ' son iphinous just as he leapt behind his fast mares — he stabbed his shoulder , hard , and down from his car iphinous crashed to earth and his limbs went slack with death
quick as a thought goes flashing through a man who 's traveled the world — ah to be there , or there !
i think i can claim to have some years on you
the horse stands towering high in the heart of troy , disgorging its armed men , with sinon in his glory , gloating over us—sinon fans the fires
spirits high with the sign , the argive armies cheered
no holding back for the bodies of the fallen : once they are gone , let fire soothe them quickly
let bygones be bygones
daring beyond your powers !
but you keep on presiding over the gods , themis , the feasting in the halls
patroclus obeyed his great friend , who put down a heavy chopping block in the firelight and across it laid a sheep 's chine , a fat goat 's and the long back cut of a full-grown pig , marbled with lard
even now cassandra revealed the future , opening lips the gods had ruled no trojan would believe
stretching hands to the gods a man would murmur , scanning the wide sky , father zeus , let ajax win , or tydeus ' son or the proud king himself of all mycenae 's gold !
and you , you make for the xanthus banks and burn the trees , hurl the stream itself into conflagration — not for a moment let him turn you back with his winning words or threats
here young boys and girls , beauties courted with costly gifts of oxen , danced and danced , linking their arms , gripping each other 's wrists
so he shouted , lashing the rage and fighting-fury in every trojan
nor did his team go long without a master , hector found one quickly — iphitus ' daring son , archeptolemus — mounted him up behind his racers , thrust the reins in the fighting driver 's hands
the shepherd among his flock , hauling his massive hulk , groping toward the shore he knew by heart
and next achilles lunged at demoleon , son of antenor , a tough defensive fighter — he stabbed his temple and cleft his helmet 's cheekpiece
antenor flanked him , mounting the gleaming car , and both men drove the team through the scaean gates , heading toward the plain
so the red-haired captain backed away from patroclus ' corpse but wheeled at bay when he reached his waiting allies , glancing round and round for ajax ' massive hulk
juno whips her on with a challenge like a lash : do me this service , virgin daughter of night , a labor just for me !
you are goddesses , you remember it all , and you can tell it all— all we catch is the distant ring of fame
he commands you to quit the war and slaughter now , go back to the tribes of gods or down to your bright sea !
sons of achaea , stop your salvos !
achilles had thrust it forth with his strong fist , fearing staunch aeneas ' spear with its long shadow would drive its whole length lightly through his buckler — groundless fears
out they rushed , the sentries in armor , forming under the son of nestor , captain thrasymedes , under ascalaphus , ialmenus , sons of ares , under meriones , aphareus and deipyrus , under the son of creon , trusty lycomedes
but just now my wife was bringing me round , her winning words urging me back to battle
i am your suppliant , prince , you must respect me !
he was on his way for a new bronze spear to use and staunch idomeneus shouted out , meriones — racing son of molus , brother-in-arms , old friend , why back from the lines , why leave the fight behind ?
— hector , his helmet flashing , called out to her — dearest of all my brothers , all these warring years , of all the sons that priam and hecuba produced !
so now they press on with their journey under way and at last approach the river
three times he charged , frenzied to bring him down , three times apollo battered his gleaming shield back — then at tydides ' fourth assault like something superhuman , the archer who strikes from worlds away shrieked out — a voice of terror — think , diomedes , shrink back now !
and the mighty god , stirred to his depths , lifts his head from the crests and serene in power , gazing out over all his realm , he sees aeneas ’ squadrons scattered across the ocean , trojans overwhelmed by the surf and the wild crashing skies
why , he 's erected a rampart , driven a trench around it , broad , enormous , and planted stakes to guard it
but great telamonian ajax spurred his argives on : be men , my friends !
but now the brilliant runner achilles watched and marked him — there he stood on the stern of his looming hollow hull , looking out over the uphill work and heartsick rout of war
i will swear , what 's more , never to drive the fatal day away from the trojans , not even when all troy burns in the ramping flames when the warring sons of achaea burn her down !
then and there menelaus might have stripped euphorbus and swept the trojan 's glittering armor off with ease so if apollo had not grudged him all that glory , rousing hector against him , swift as ares
and a throng of monsters too—what brutal forms are stabled at the gates—centaurs , mongrel scyllas , part women , part beasts , and hundred-handed briareus and the savage hydra of lerna , that hissing horror , the chimaera armed with torches—gorgons , harpies and triple-bodied geryon , his great ghost
shaft poised , he hurled and its long shadow flew and it struck tydides ' shield , the brazen spearhead winging , drilling right on through to his breastplate , pandarus yelling over him wildly now , you are hit — clean through the side !
fight — the light of safety lies in our fighting hands , not spines gone soft in battle !
may these galleys never be wrecked on any passage out or overpowered by whirling storms at sea , let their birth on our mountains be a blessing !
come , call up whatever courage you can muster
now acestes alone remained , and his prize lost
now give them glory , if only a moment 's glory — long as zeus still slumbers
have no fear of an argive ambush packed with danger — achilles vowed , when he sent me home from the black ships , not to do us harm till the twelfth dawn arrives
true , but the queen— who can delude a lover ? —soon caught wind of a plot afoot , the first to sense the trojans are on the move
ajax suddenly spun a glinting spear at polydamas , fast , but the trojan dodged black fate himself with a quick spring to the side — but antenor 's son archelochus caught the shaft for the gods had doomed that fighting man to death
his armies roared assent
i carry aboard my ships the gods of house and home we seized from enemy hands
with that the son of cronus caught his wife in his arms and under them now the holy earth burst with fresh green grass , crocus and hyacinth , clover soaked with dew , so thick and soft it lifted their bodies off the hard , packed ground
now it ’ s only a bay , a treacherous cove for ships
but not quite finished yet
they even impale the heads on brandished pikes , the heads—a grisly sight—and strut behind them , baiting them with outcries
who will revere the power of juno after this— lay gifts on my altar , lift his hands in prayer ?
only helenor and lycus slip to safety , just—helenor still in the flush of youth
he spurned their offer , firmly , even swore an oath : no , no , by zeus — by the highest , greatest god !
each of you get a grip on yourself — where 's your pride , your soldier 's sense of shame ?
we who have drunk deep of each and every disaster land and sea can offer
you ’ d think the cyclades ripped up by the roots , afloat on the swells , or mountains ramming against mountains , so immense the turrets astern as sailors attack them , showering flaming tow and hot bolts of flying steel , and the fresh blood running red on neptune ’ s fields
thundering zeus has spread his hands above her
so you , achilles — great godlike achilles — i made you my son , i tried , so someday you might fight disaster off my back
breaking off , andromache wept , her wailing filled the grove , inconsolable
decreeing triumph for us , not for the argives now
sthenelus checked his own racers clear of the crash of battle , lashed them tight to his chariot-rails with reins then dashed for aeneas ' glossy full-maned team and drove them out of the trojan lines and into his
but time and again , as they were setting sail , the heavy seas would keep them confined to port and the southwind filled their hearts with dread and worst of all , once this horse , this mass of timber with locking planks , stood stationed here at last , the thunderheads rumbled up and down the sky
stand up , look for yourselves !
now for orontes , hardy soldier , now for amycus , now for the brutal fate that lycus may have met , then gyas and brave cloanthus , hearts of oak
the troops sprang up , scattered back to the ships , lit fires beside their tents and took their meal
that wand in his grip he flew , the mighty giant-killer touching down on troy and the hellespont in no time and from there he went on foot , for all the world like a young prince , sporting his first beard , just in the prime and fresh warm pride of youth
once he sees there is no running away from battle , no turning aside camilla ’ s attack , he tries to devise a ruse with all his craft and cunning , letting loose : now where ’ s the glory , tell me , a woman putting her trust in a powerful horse ?
just that moment the ithacan haled the prophet , calchas , into our midst—he ’ d twist it out of him , what was the gods ’ will ?
how he would dote on her and spurn his wedded wife , my own mother !
who will take him on ?
you have hoards of gold in your tents , bronze , sheep , serving-girls by the score and purebred racers too : pick some bigger trophy out of the whole lot and hand it on to the man , but do it later — or now , at once , and win your troops ' applause
no , with a prayer to zeus some new fighting power had filled his dark heart and he quickly called his trusted friend alcimedon : alcimedon , keep those horses close beside me , breathing down my neck
he marked him quickly , out on the left flank and rousing cohorts , driving them back to war , and the red-haired captain halted near and called , turn this way , antilochus , prince , and hear the news , dreadful news — would to god it had never happened !
so he said and walking on ahead , from high above points out to them open country swept with light
so you can win great honor , great glory for me in the eyes of all the argive ranks , and they , they will send her back , my lithe and lovely girl , and top it off with troves of glittering gifts
for me to unite my daughter with any one of her former suitors would have been wrong , forbidden : all the gods and prophets made that plain
deluge all your channels from all your gushing springs — muster all your torrents — raise up a tremendous wave , rumbling , booming with timber , boulders crashing — we will stop this wild man in his tracks , lording it in his power now and raging like some god !
but the queen , afraid of the new rules of engagement , wept , and bent on her own death embraced her ardent son-in-law to be : turnus , by these tears of mine , by any concern for amata that moves your heart , you are my only hope , now , you the one relief to my wretched old age
not until you do will the great jaws of our spellbound house gape wide
together they recognize the trophies of war— messapus ’ burnished helmet and many emblems retrieved with so much sweat
aeneas , soon as his eyes drank in that plunder—keepsake of his own savage grief—flaring up in fury , terrible in his rage , he cries : decked in the spoils you stripped from one i loved—escape my clutches ?
such a long hard labor it was to found the roman people
and the dog star scorched the green fields barren , the grasses shriveled , blighted crops refused us food
then both went thrashing into the lines to make a slaughter as two wild boars bristling , ramping back for the kill , fling themselves on the yelping packs that hunt them — back they whirled on attack and laid the trojans low while achaeans just in flight from hector 's onset leapt at the chance to gather second wind
with camilla ’ s last words she lost her grip on the reins and , all against her will , slipped down to the ground
achilles , put some human kindness in your heart
flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the house of death , wailing his fate , leaving his manhood far behind , his young and supple strength
we few escaped and floated toward your coast
but how bitter the first fruits of a man ’ s youth , the hard lessons learned in a war so near at hand , and none of the gods would hear my vows , my prayers
but priam 's son prince hector and royal odysseus measured off the ground for single combat first , then dropped two stones in a helmet , lots for casting — who would be first to hurl his bronze-tipped spear ?
and with each word he points to the sopping muck that fouled his face and limbs
you would soon feel his force , that man you robbed of his sumptuous , warm wife
up with you — fast !
not a single god can stand against you — no , not i — ca not fight such fire , such fury — hold your attack , stop !
inside , panic , chaos , soldiers fighting to find some way out of the flames—no hope
even for generations still to come , to learn that achaean armies so strong , so vast , fought a futile war
she fears everything now , even with all secure
menacing so as brilliant achilles raised the pelian ash spear but the fighting asteropaeus , quick , ambidextrous , hurled both spears at once — one shaft hit the shield , no breakthrough , the shaft could not smash through , the gold blocked it , forged in the god 's gift
so come , follow my orders
if you had sprung from another god , believe me , and grown into such a blinding devastation , long ago you would have dropped below the titans , deep in the dark pit
spurring her on , juno left juturna torn , distraught with the wound that broke her heart
to suffer greater blows ?
so i , i took it into my head to lay him low with sharp bronze !
despite my anguish i will beat it down , the fury mounting inside me , down by force
teucer was first to kill his man , a son of mentor , breeder of stallions , the rugged spearman imbrius
bear with me now
my hand will shield you in war today and guide you toward the great rewards
but who believed a trojan expedition could reach italian shores ?
down from the gods you came to waylay me — you seduced me blind
welcome them to your camp as allies , seal your pacts
italy-bound we were when , surging with sudden breakers stormy orion drove us against blind shoals and from the south came vicious gales to scatter us , whelmed by the sea , across the murderous surf and rocky barrier reefs
but not without jury picked by lot , not without judge are their places handed down
it all began when artemis throned in gold loosed a disaster on them , incensed that oeneus offered her no first fruits , his orchard 's crowning glory
here greeks in flight , routed by troy ’ s young ranks , there trojans routed by plumed achilles in his chariot
rolling her up in cork-bark stripped from trees , he lashed her fast to the weapon , just mid-haft and balancing both in his right hand , he prays to the skies : bountiful one , to you , lover of groves , latona ’ s daughter , a father devotes his baby girl
he fetched and tethered a heavy-duty mule in the ring , six years old , unbroken — the hardest kind to break — and offered the loser a cup with double handles
with that and with all his might the old man flings his spear— but too impotent now to pierce , it merely grazes pyrrhus ’ brazen shield that blocks its way and clings there , dangling limp from the boss , all for nothing
look , we will make you a promise — we will keep it too
before patroclus met his day of destiny , true , it warmed my heart a bit to spare some trojans : droves i took alive and auctioned off as slaves
but still the gods forbid an italian commander to lead a race so great— choose leaders from overseas !
lords of the argives , o my captains !
you want the men to grieve for the dead by starving ?
he was the one , in fact , who ordered , pressed me on to reach your doors and seek you , beg you now
why , not even ares the deathless god of war , not even athena — for all their heavy labor — could hack a passage through such jaws of battle
their hunger sated , the tables cleared away , they talk on for hours , asking after their missing shipmates—wavering now between hope and fear : what to believe about the rest ?
now surely i have never probed or pried in the past
he raised back the carved lids of the chests and lifted out twelve robes , handsome , rich brocades , twelve cloaks , unlined and light , as many blankets , as many big white capes and shirts to go with them
if wind-swift iris had not swept from olympus bearing her message — peleus ' son must arm — but all unknown to zeus and the other gods since hera spurred her on
this shrine is their senate , this the site of their sacred banquets
so hector commanded his trojans , sounding out , now storm the ships !
such pains the blissful gods are lavishing on your son , dead man though he is — the gods love him dearly !
and wrap your brow with the holy bands
they had in hand a bolt they had just hammered out , one of the countless bolts the father rains on earth from the arching sky—part buffed already , part still rough
and following on that blow he seizes his dazed foe ’ s locks in his left hand and pins him fast to the ground with a knee full force and digs his rigid blade in ebysus ’ flank
did not we all hear his plan in secret council ?
even the gods themselves can bend and change , and theirs is the greater power , honor , strength
mother tells me , the immortal goddess thetis with her glistening feet , that two fates bear me on to the day of death
andromache grieves no less at our final parting
you can all turn to earth and water — rot away !
my heart tells me , my ears ring with the din of drumming hoofs
and once we would had our fill of food and drink , i led off with our plan , inviting the two of you to come campaign with us
if only the god would share the smoky savor of lambs and full-grown goats , apollo might be willing , still , somehow , to save us from this plague
the splendor of heroes , and he shot up like a young branch , like a fine tree i reared him — the orchard 's crowning glory — but only to send him off in the beaked ships to troy to battle trojans !
teach me the way , throw wide the sacred doors !
or let him take still more , piling up his kills ?
our people will live in peace on the rich soil of troy , our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of argos , the land of achaea where the women are a wonder
go at once to the camp , give your son this order : tell him the gods are angry with him now and i am rising over them all in deathless wrath that he in heartsick fury still holds hector 's body , there by his beaked ships , and will not give him back — perhaps in fear of me he will give him back at once
he thrilled to have it and spoke out winging words : true , true , my son , all of it , right on the mark
but turnus is dead against their joining up with the trojan camp
she broke off , her left hand seizing both wrists of the goddess , right hand stripping the bow and quiver off her shoulders — hera boxed the huntress ' ears with her own weapons , smiling broadly now as her victim writhed away and showering arrows scattered
thetis would ask a favor of you !
but if your battles teach you to hope in arms , the arms you buckle on , your first duty should be to guard our house
heralds brought the water at once and rinsed their hands , and the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all
he had not laid a hand on his black benched hull , such anguish racked his heart and fighting spirit
in panic we rush to escape , get clear of his reach , take aboard the fugitive—he had earned his way— and we cut our lines , dead quiet , put our backs in a racing stroke that makes the waters churn
long years had brought their fighting days to a halt but they were eloquent speakers still , clear as cicadas settled on treetops , lifting their voices through the forest , rising softly , falling , dying away
and we your celebrants firm in our faith , we plant our feet in your embers glowing hot !
and the old man burned these over dried split wood and over the quarters poured out glistening wine while young men at his side held five-pronged forks
or pacts between both armies ?
and anguish seized menelaus lord of the war cry
come , spin him round in his tracks and drive him back
now , in any event , swift achilles makes it his turning-post
and rouse the rest of your armies !
quickly notching the sharp arrow on the string he swore to apollo , wolf-god , glorious archer , he would slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs when he marched home to zelea 's sacred city
what if one of the deathless gods observes us , sleeping together , yes — and runs off to the rest and points us out to all ?
now , all in a mass , drive hard against them — rousing battering war against these stallion-breaking trojans !
— a crashing attack — and a pair of ramping lions had seized a bull from the cattle 's front ranks — he bellowed out as they dragged him off in agony
elated and making way through crowds of troops he found the two called ajax , great and little , both captains armed for attack with a cloud of infantry forming up behind them
iron inside your chest , that heart of yours
as achaeans and trojans wondered what was coming , athena merged in the trojan columns like a fighter , like antenor 's son the rugged spearman laodocus , hunting for pandarus , hoping to find the archer
he knew all things that are , all things that are past and all that are to come , the seer who had led the argive ships to troy with the second sight that god apollo gave him
aeneas came up first with long , menacing strides , head tossing his heavy helmet , his charging shield thrust out to defend his chest , and shook his bronze spear
they will sweep us back to the city , back to safety if zeus hands tydeus ' son the glory once again
why do not you get my wagon ready — now , at once ?
tell her to hurry , sprinkle herself with river water , bring the victims marked for the sacrifice i must make
so come , do as i say , and let us all unite
and the first latins to rush through the open gates ?
up stood polypoetes , always braced for battle , leonteus flanked him , strong , intense as a god , then telamon 's son great ajax , lord epeus too
the brilliant runner achilles lay among his ships , raging over briseis , the girl with lustrous hair , the prize he seized from lyrnessus — after he had fought to exhaustion at lyrnessus , storming the heights , and breached the walls of thebes and toppled the vaunting spearmen epistrophus and mynes , sons of king euenus , selepius ' son
take my words to aeneas , hardly words to please that craven phrygian king !
true , they have labored long — they are desperate for home
there he huddles before his curving , beaked ships , racked with grief for his dear friend while others scatter , settling down to their meal
with that , he wreathes his brows with a leafy green spray and prays to the spirit of the place , and earth , first of the gods , and nymphs and rivers still unknown , and then to the night and the rising stars of night
you look so harried
i ’ ll add this too , if i can depend on your good will : with rumors i will draw the border towns into war , ignite their hearts with a maddening lust for battle
oenotrians settled it ; now we hear their descendants call their kingdom italy , after their leader , italus
my own flesh and blood !
they held their attack
and the knees of every trojan shook with fear , each veteran frantic , glancing left and right — how to escape his sudden , plunging death ?
touched by love for his own father , this image stirred his heart
so come then , listen , as i count out the gifts , the troves in his tents that agamemnon vows to give you
my shipmates strip and glistening sleek with oil , wrestle the old trojan way , our spirits high— we ’ d skimmed past such a flurry of argive cities , holding true to our flight through waters held by foes
never once did my altar lack its share of victims , winecups tipped and the deep smoky savor
is that why you order me to give her back ?
think what a city you will see , my sister , what a kingdom rising high if you marry such a man !
oh , you can whisk aeneas clear of the clutches of the greeks , in place of a man puff up some vapid fume of air !
a band of loyal followers rushed to help him , led him out of the ring , his feet dragging , head lolling to one side , spitting clots of blood
come , please , sit down on this chair here
just for the sake of rivalry , soldier 's pride , do not rush to fight with a better man , with hector the son of priam
no , this is the pleasure of overweening zeus , it seems — to kill the achaeans here , our memory blotted out a world away from argos
but above all , tragic dido , doomed to a plague about to strike , can not feast her eyes enough , thrilled both by the boy and gifts he brings and the more she looks the more the fire grows
but i defeated fate , a father doomed to outlive his son
at once aeneas , limbs limp in the chill of fear , groans and lifting both his palms toward the stars cries out : three , four times blest , my comrades lucky to die beneath the soaring walls of troy— before their parents ’ eyes !
there oeneus stayed , on his own native soil , but father wandered far , driven to live in argos
but the mighty god of earthquakes was not blind
mostly slingers spraying pellets of livid lead , some brandish a pair of lances , all heads cowled with tawny wolfskin caps , their left feet planted , making a naked print , their right feet shod with a rugged rawhide boot
no one saw them at first , neither man nor woman , none before cassandra , golden as goddess aphrodite
go no further down the road of hatred
at any moment he will storm king priam 's mighty stronghold down — the trojans ca not stand up to the man in battle
hovering at his head the escort rose and spoke : not a care in the world , old man ?
they know right from wrong
dragging his fine chariot , flogging his team before him
then my cheeks still sported the bloom of youth and i was full of wonder to see the chiefs of troy , wonder to see laomedon ’ s son , priam himself , no doubt , but one walked taller than all the rest—anchises
you have slaughtered centaurs born of the clouds , half man , half horse , hylaeus and pholus—the bull , the monster of crete , the tremendous nemean lion holed in his rocky den
but turnus , think , he ’ ll rise on the wings of fame to meet the gods , gods on whose altars he has offered up his life : he will live forever , sung on the lips of men !
some little aeneas playing about our halls , whose features at least would bring you back to me in spite of all , i would not feel so totally devastated , so destroyed
he rode to war as well , virbius , striking son of hippolytus , sent to fight by his mother aricia : virbius in his triumph , bred in egeria ’ s grove that rings the marshy banks where diana ’ s altar stands , rich with victims fit to win her favor
hera , hera , queen of the gods and daughter of mighty cronus — any other immortal god who lives forever , believe me , i would put to sleep in a wink , even the rolling tides of the great ocean river , the fountainhead that brought them all to birth
lynceus swings to attack , shouting his comrades on—but first from the right-hand rampart turnus spins with one stroke of his dazzling sword , close-up , that brings down lynceus , slashes his head off , head and helmet tumbling far away
even here , merit will have its true reward
no need for you to tell it
no more trading your stinging insults now , ajax , idomeneus !
and never sated with fighting ?
then dipping sweet nectar up from the mixing bowl he poured it round to all the immortals , left to right
this altar will shield us all or else you ’ ll die with us
trust me , this fame of ours will offer us some haven
the heavens call for me
juno stopped , transfixed with anguish , then , shaking her head , this exclamation came pouring from her heart : that cursed race i loathe—their phrygian fate that clashes with my own !
if what you say is true , that must be my pleasure
let me look at your face , my son , exchange some words , and hear your familiar voice
mine is the duty to follow your commands
roving the forests , home to the well-known door it came , all on its own , even at dead of night
right of the whole engagement , work the center or go at the left flank ?
turnus at this point , fighting off on the outskirts of the field , is hunting a few stragglers
the lord of the war cry told the goddess quickly , phoenix , father , good old soldier — if only pallas would give me power and drive the weapons off me !
and once he would thrilled his heart with looking hard at the armor 's well-wrought beauty , he turned to his mother , winged words flying : mother — armor sent by the god — you are right , only immortal gods could forge such work , no man on earth could ever bring it off !
i have just splintered the lance i used to carry , smashed it against his shield — swaggering deiphobus
three great strides he took , on the fourth he reached his goal , aegae port where his famous halls are built in the green depths , the shimmering golden halls of the god that stand forever
but the fiery runner achilles burst out in anger , why , roan beauty — why prophesy my doom ?
do not dismiss their appeal , their expedition here — though no one could blame your anger , not before
with that the brilliant achilles ordered friends to set a large three-legged cauldron over the fire and wash the clotted blood from patroclus ' wounds with all good speed
gods , beat back disaster !
first he seizes phaleris , cuts the knees from under gyges— snatching their spears he whips them into the backs of men who break and run as juno builds his courage , his war-lust
the phantom sifting through his fingers , light as wind , quick as a dream in flight
i have founded a noble city , seen my ramparts rise
so now you harness the racing team for us while i go into the halls of storming zeus and buckle on my gear and arm for combat
aeneas fixes the crests still dripping blood , the enemy ’ s splintered spears and breastplate battered hard and pierced in a dozen places
so if die she must , she ’ ll leave no way untried
or if some care for a parent ’ s grief can touch you still , i pray you—you had such a father , in old anchises— pity daunus in his old age and send me back to my own people , or if you would prefer , send them my dead body stripped of life
ulysses has seen the cyclops on mount etna
no reason to fear that prophecy , the horror of eating your own platters
racked with agony , her glowing flesh blood-dark
an aide saw them and put some oxhides down
or me , and the destiny that weighs me down , your widow , now so soon ?
this man on horseback , he will steady the roman state when rocked by chaos , mow the carthaginians down in droves , the rebel gauls
now you ’ re in turnus ’ hands
he seethes on a heaving sea as warring anxieties call him back and forth
if the argives roll us back away from the ships , trapped and tangled there in the yawning trench , no runner , i tell you , pressed by an argive rally , could struggle free and bear the news to troy
you have a heart of iron !
oh make me young again , and the strength inside me steady as a rock !
in the same breath , shining hector reached down for his son — but the boy recoiled , cringing against his nurse 's full breast , screaming out at the sight of his own father , terrified by the flashing bronze , the horsehair crest , the great ridge of the helmet nodding , bristling terror — so it struck his eyes
a disaster 's right upon us
back diomedes jumped on his car and told his driver to make for the hollow ships — tydides racked with pain
that woman spawns her plots , mulling over some desperate outrage in her heart , lashing her surging rage , she ’ s bent on death
that ’ s what the wind demands , says good aeneas
so wounded eurypylus pleaded , friends around him crowding , bracing shields against their shoulders , spears brandished high and back to the bulking front came giant ajax now
the two immortals stepped briskly as wild doves , quivering , keen to defend the fighting men of argos
where can he run ?
but once he would swallowed down the sparrow with her brood , the son of crooked cronus who sent the serpent forth turned him into a sign , a monument clear to see — zeus struck him to stone !
don ’ t hold me back
would jove want one city to hold the tyrians and the trojan exiles ?
a man 's tongue is a glib and twisty thing
do not lay hand to sword
at last he would leap to his feet , wander in anguish , aimless along the surf , and dawn on dawn flaming over the sea and shore would find him pacing
aeneas keeps down , huddling under his own shield , enraged
you , the bravest of all achaeans — and not one with the spine to battle hector face-to-face !
at last the trojan captains hear of the massacre of their troops
is there any trace of antheus now , tossed by the gales , or his warships banked with oars ?
but then , once he received that fatal message sent from his own daughter 's husband , first he ordered bellerophon to kill the chimaera — grim monster sprung of the gods , nothing human , all lion in front , all snake behind , all goat between , terrible , blasting lethal fire at every breath !
and give me your own fine armor to buckle on my back , so the trojans might take me for you , achilles , yes , hold off from attack , and achaea 's fighting sons get second wind , exhausted as they are
what if atrides agamemnon learns you are here — what if the whole achaean army learns you are here ?
but i — whatever fists and feet and strength can do , that i will do , i swear , not hang back , not one inch
quick , run to achilles ' moorings up the beach and tell him all
first to confront him ?
the two aeantes , old campaigners , volunteered , meriones volunteered and nestor 's son leapt up and menelaus the famous spearman volunteered and battle-hardened odysseus too , to foray into the trojan units camped for the night — odysseus ' blood was always up for exploit
soon as the sun came up in flames above the earth we joined battle , lifting a prayer to zeus and pallas
but the god who grips the earth restrained the queen : hera , so hard , so senseless !
with that challenge both went soaring home to the deathless ones on high but achilles rampaged on with the gods ' strong command driving him down the plain where the river flooded now , an immense , cresting outrush bursting with burnished gear and troops of battle dead , men cut down in their prime , floating corpses rolling — but achilles surged on too with high hurdling strides , charging against the river , on , breakneck on and the river could not stop him , not for all its reach and tide race , not with athena pumping enormous strength deep down achilles ' heart — but the xanthus river would not slack his fury either , he raged at achilles all the more , he marshaled up a mountainous ridge of water , roaring out to simois , oh dear brother , rise !
from there , i have heard , a massylian priestess comes who tended the temple held by hesperian daughters
then is the time to clash in hatred , then to ravage each other
it is not the will of fate that the proud trojans ' citadel fall before your spear , not even before achilles — far greater man than you !
and telamonian ajax joined him , calling out , i can feel it too , now , the hands on my spear , invincible hands quivering tense for battle , look — the power rising within me , feet beneath me rushing me on !
they pressed us hard , they begged us to give them battle-tested allies
who is that , father , matching marcellus stride for stride ?
magnificent paris brought those women back himself from sidon , sailing the open seas on the same long voyage he swept helen off , her famous father 's child
for now is the seventh summer that has borne you wandering all the lands and seas on earth
not too proud now
he spun on his heels and left them there in place , heading for other ranks and came on nestor next , the clear speaker of pylos posting troops , readying them for action , combat units forming under the lanky pelagon , alastor and chromius , haemon and stocky bias , skilled captain of armies
think of apollo leaving his lycian haunts and xanthus in winter spate , he ’ s out to visit delos , his mother ’ s isle , and strike up the dance again while round the altars swirls a growing throng of cretans , dryopians , agathyrsians with tattoos , and a drumming roar goes up as the god himself strides the cynthian ridge , his streaming hair braided with pliant laurel leaves entwined in twists of gold , and arrows clash on his shoulders
but not the trojans , no
there ’ s a place for mischief— we ’ ve seen it ourselves—an open fork in the road , at the gate that fronts the coast
now , though , if you really want me to fight to the finish here , have all trojans and argives take their seats and pit me against menelaus dear to ares — right between the lines — we will fight it out for helen and all her wealth
it should have then , when you offered him your scepter
i come to you from the nightmare furies ’ den , i brandish war and death in my right hand !
glancing around he spots a huge rock , huge , ages old , and lying out in the field by chance , placed as a boundary stone to settle border wars
sergestus , who gives his name to the sergian house , rides the tremendous vessel centaur
meanwhile dawn rose up and left her ocean bed and soon as her rays have lit the sky , an elite band of young huntsmen streams out through the gates , bearing the nets , wide-meshed or tight for traps and their hunting spears with broad iron heads , troops of massylian horsemen galloping hard , packs of powerful hounds , keen on the scent
and droves of fat sheep and shambling crook-horned cattle they led before the pyre , skinned and dressed them well
if any other achaean had told us of this dream we would call it false and turn our backs upon it
and his heart melted now like the dew that wets the corn when the fresh stalks rise up and the ripe fields ripple — so the heart in your chest was melted now , menelaus , and you gave your friend an answer , winged words : antilochus , now it is my turn to yield to you , for all my mounting anger
this is his one reply that ’ s played me false : he swore you would cross the ocean safe and sound and reach italian shores
you do not look right or left
back i went to my people and i was amazed to see what throngs of new companions had poured in to swell our numbers , mothers , men , our forces gathered for exile , grieving masses
all the more fiercely trojans swarm him , war cries breaking , ranks packed tight as a band of huntsmen bristling spears , attacking a savage lion
so apollo ’ s aged priestess ended her answer , then she added : come , press on with your journey
but never would he repay his loving parents now for the gift of rearing — his life cut short so soon , brought down by the spear of lionhearted ajax
fiercer still , the monstrous hydra , fifty black maws gaping , holds its lair inside
all that i promised once i have performed at last
and we stood by , amazed that such a marvel came to light
so athena fired the fool 's heart inside him
he is destined to survive
have you the daring to wing an arrow at menelaus ?
so prince achilles hailed and led them in , sat them down on settles with purple carpets and quickly told patroclus standing by , come , a bigger winebowl , son of menoetius , set it here
far out in the offing , fronting the foaming coastline , looms a rock
that 's when the fury gripped the son of atreus
there they spent the night and took the gift of sleep
not that they would hide him out of friendship , even if someone saw him — all of them hated him like death , black death
why , even if you were badly wounded in battle , winged by a shaft or gored by a blade close-up , the weapon would never hit you behind , in neck or back — it would pierce your chest or guts as you press forward , lusting for all the champions ' lovely give-and-take
now , few out of many truths i will reveal to you , so you can cross the welcoming seas more safely , moor secure in a latian harbor
the region next to them is held by those sad ghosts , innocents all , who brought on death by their own hands ; despising the light , they threw their lives away
many a mother in tuscan cities yearned for her as a daughter
for the winner a large tripod made to stride a fire and worth a dozen oxen , so the soldiers reckoned
i swear by the stars , by the powers on high , whatever faith one swears by here in the depths of earth , i left your shores , my queen , against my will
but king agamemnon interceded quickly , diomedes , soldier after my own heart , pick your comrade now , whomever you want , the best of the volunteers — how many long to go !
numanus , out of the front lines he swaggered , chest puffed up with his newfound royal rank and he let loose an indiscriminate string of ugly insults , flaunting his own power to high heaven : what , have you no shame ?
so , certain that all contenders had withdrawn , the trophy his alone , he strode up to aeneas now and never pausing , full of swagger , grasps the bull ’ s horn with his left hand and boasts : son of venus , since no one dares to face me in the ring , how long do i have to stand here ?
then in ride the boys , trim in their ranks before their parents ’ eyes , mounted on bridled steeds and glittering in the light and as they pass , the men of troy and sicily murmur a hum of admiration
his forebear is pilumnus , his mother a goddess , venilia !
do not harbor it deep inside you
until you argives seize the well-built towers of troy or you yourselves are crushed against your ships
so leto gathered the reflex bow and arrows scattered left and right in the swirling dust , and bearing her daughter 's archery in her arms withdrew from the field of battle trailing artemis
his pleas were moving the heart in menelaus , just at the point of handing him to an aide to take him back to the fast achaean ships
why , it seems like only yesterday or the day before when our vast armada gathered , moored at aulis , freighted with slaughter bound for priam 's troy
and the white-armed goddess hera obeyed at once — clearing ida 's peaks she soared for sheer olympus
those bodies felled by the sword and strewn about the field : return them , let them lie with mounds of earth for cover
no time for speeches now , it 's time to fight
where would destiny take us ?
come , try me , immortals , so all of you can learn
yes , we will keep clear of the war as you command
now come , we haul a black ship down to the bright sea , gather a decent number of oarsmen along her locks and put aboard a sacrifice , and chryseis herself , in all her beauty
we all recall that moment — who could forget it ?
and achaea 's kings all shouted their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking diomedes ' challenge
one would glance at a comrade , groaning , what next — battle again , more pain and grisly fighting ?
where are you flying now— what other walls , what other ramparts have you got ?
but there he sits , off and away — with never a care or qualm for us — claiming that he among the deathless gods on high is first in strength and power , none in the world his rival
don ’ t join battle , sword to sword
if achilles fights the trojans — unopposed by us — not for a moment will they hold his breakneck force
you unforgivable , you
but raising his shield , swerving to brave his foe , he strained to save himself with his naked sword—when the wheel and whirling axle knocked him headlong , ground him into the dust
routed so , we have seen our fill of death
father , what motive changed your mind ?
but now a crisis has overwhelmed our armies
the shaft of a good-for-nothing coward 's got no point but mine 's got heft and edge
look at the armies massing , cities bolting their gates , honing swords against me to cut my loved ones down
why this mad desire , poor souls , for the light of life ?
but only if phoenix wishes
left behind there , down by the beaked ships his great avenger waited , a greater man by far — that man was i , and i smashed your strength !
right here , not far to seek
you have done me so many kindnesses , and you could count them all
so hector shouted out to deiphobus bearing his white shield — with a ringing shout he called for a heavy lance — but the man was nowhere near him , vanished — yes and hector knew the truth in his heart and the fighter cried aloud , my time has come !
it 's hard for me , strong as i am , single-handed to breach the wall and cut a path to the ships — come , shoulder-to-shoulder !
now repay me for all the loving care andromache , generous eetion 's daughter , showered on you aplenty
he still refuses , holds to his resolve , clings to the spot
nor did i bring one ray of hope to my patroclus , nor to the rest of all my steadfast comrades , countless ranks struck down by mighty hector — no , no , here i sit by the ships
now ilioneus ’ sturdy ship , now brave achates ’ , now the galley that carried abas , another , aged aletes , yes , the storm routs them all , down to the last craft the joints split , beams spring and the lethal flood pours in
at first the trojans could ram the argives back and they abandoned the corpse , their fiery-eyed battalions fled away in panic
so many widows left
the head wrenched from the shoulders
next aeneas , as rugged cisseus , giant gyas clubbed their way through his ranks : he flung both down to death
and catching sight of helen moving along the ramparts , they murmured one to another , gentle , winged words : who on earth could blame them ?
nestor the noble charioteer embraced his offer : generous marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon !
enough of endless tears , the pain that breaks the spirit
lurking there under cover , he hit it in the heart and the fine kill went sprawling down the rocks
condemned to beg for his own death and brutal doom
and now pisander rushed menelaus famed in arms but a grim fate was rushing him to the stroke of death — to be crushed in this hell of war by you , menelaus
now for a dozen days they made their truce and , peace intervening , trojans and latins mingled safely , ranging the woods and mountain ridges side by side
so strong , this dares , first to cock his head for combat , flaunting his broad shoulders , sparring , lefts and rights , beating the air with blows
— turning over victory to poseidon , total victory , giving him all the glory here without a fight
now the renowned spearman ajax rushed against him , slashing him down the flank , knocking him backward — trojans and argives swarming over him , out for blood
some charge at the gates and cut the sentries down and others whirl their steel , blot out the sky with spears
at that , both of them march in step along the shadowed paths , consuming the space between , and approach the doors
hercules , you the unvanquished one !
you will never persuade me
you are far stronger than i still , you must not make my labor come to nothing
now the son of atreus stripped him , robbed his corpse and strode back to his waiting argive armies , hoisting the gleaming gear
now after meriones yoked his sleek horses fifth , they boarded their cars and dropped lots in a helmet
until some fatal power decides between us both , handing victory down to our side — or the other
he even sees himself swept up in the melee , clashing with greek captains , sees the troops of the dawn and swarthy memnon ’ s arms
better to flee from death than feel its grip
and then , at that , an immense cry rose up and hit the golden stars
but now aeneas , still at sea , scanning the offing , spots an enormous wood and running through it , the tiber in all its glory , rapids , whirlpools golden with sand and bursting out to sea
then his mother who bore him — oh so doomed , she and i could glut ourselves with grief
but neleus would not let me arm for action — he would hidden away my horses , thought his boy still green at the work of war
the weapon shaking , planted fast in the ground , his whole arm 's power poured in a wasted shot , aeneas flared in anger , shouting out , meriones — great dancer as you are , my spear would have stopped your dancing days for good if only i had hit you !
not one of you dare forget those threats you hurled from the fast trim ships against the trojans all the while i raged , and i was the one you blamed , down to the last fighter : 'brutal son of peleus — your mother nursed you on gall !
now the besiegers , soon as they heard the uproar burst from the cattle as they debated , huddled in council , mounted at once behind their racing teams , rode hard to the rescue , arrived at once , and lining up for assault both armies battled it out along the river banks — they raked each other with hurtling bronze-tipped spears
no , no , let the earth come piling over my dead body before i hear your cries , i hear you dragged away !
there sits great aeneas
no brother deserts a brother here !
i can see the clouds parting , the stars riding the arching skies
then men from fields where jove of anxur reigns and goddess feronia takes joy in her fine green grove , and troops from satura ’ s black marsh where the frigid ufens weaves his way through a valley ’ s bottom land and plunges down to sea
iarbas—son of an african nymph whom jove had raped— raised the god a hundred splendid temples across the king ’ s wide realm , a hundred altars too , consecrating the sacred fires that never died , eternal sentinels of the gods
so lead us on to the left flank — we will soon see if we give our enemy glory or win it for ourselves
both champions , belted tight , stepped into the ring and grappling each other hard with big burly arms , locked like rafters a master builder bolts together , slanting into a pitched roof to fight the ripping winds
oh if only — father zeus , athena , apollo — i were young again !
how he bragged and hector , grasping his scepter , swore a binding oath : now zeus my witness , thundering lord of hera — no other trojan fighter will ride behind that team , none but you , i swear — they will be your glory all your life to come !
credit will go to you for whatever he proposes
then , if the ninth dawn brings a brilliant day to the race of men and her rays lay bare the earth , i shall hold games for all our trojans
the harpy celaeno alone foretold a monstrous sign , chanting out the unspeakable—withering wrath to come and the ghastly pangs of famine
as gale-winds swirl and shatter under the shrilling gusts on days when drifts of dust lie piled thick on the roads and winds whip up the dirt in a dense whirling cloud — so the battle broke , storming chaos , troops inflamed , slashing each other with bronze , carnage mounting , manslaughtering combat bristling with rangy spears , the honed lances brandished in hand and ripping flesh and the eyes dazzled now , blind with the glare of bronze , glittering helmets flashing , breastplates freshly burnished , shields fiery in sunlight , fighters plowing on in a mass
i will hold our attack as long as you require
meleager 's cleopatra — she was the one he lay beside those days , brooding over his heartbreaking anger
give me your horses — so i can reach olympus , the gods ' steep stronghold
no love between us
but father zeus on the heights forced ajax to retreat
at that hour the morning star comes rising up to herald a new day on earth , and riding in its wake the dawn flings out her golden robe across the sea , the funeral fires sank low , the flames died down
zeus who rules the world forbids me to battle trojans all day long
now the great array of gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long , but the peaceful grip of sleep could not hold zeus , turning it over in his mind
but now , chaos—the city begins to reel with cries of grief , louder , stronger , even though father ’ s palace stood well back , screened off by trees , but still the clash of arms rings clearer , horror on the attack
these are the solemn honors owed the dead
now as the two came closing on each other patroclus suddenly picked off thrasymelus the famous driver , the aide who flanked sarpedon — he speared him down the guts and loosed his limbs
trust me , my friend , you will never force the trojans back from this corpse with a few stinging taunts — earth will bury many a man before that
he swore he would give me the great achilles ' stallions , purebred racers , his burnished bronze chariot too !
and they , they shook from head to foot , terrified , none with the nerve to face him then
but the only thing you will win at my hands here , i promise you , is slaughter and black doom
not that sarpedon yielded all the way , never , his heart still raced with hopes of winning glory , whirling , shouting back to his splendid lycians , lycians — why do you slack your fighting-fury now ?
i have avenged my husband , punished my blood-brother , our mortal foe
put zeus to sleep for me !
from the peak of aeneas ’ helmet flames are leaping forth and a deadly blaze comes pouring from its crest
so they will say , someday , and my fame will never die
hector killed him now with whetted bronze , cleaving his skull above the ear as he stood by ajax
beware the toils of war
as ravening fire rips through big stands of timber high on a mountain ridge and the blaze flares miles away , so from the marching troops the blaze of bronze armor , splendid and superhuman , flared across the earth , flashing into the air to hit the skies
now we will fight — and death to the one marked out for doom and death !
look at you , how you sleep in the midst of men who would kill you — and just because achilles spared your life
soldiers , he shouts from a barrow some way off , what drives you to try these unfamiliar paths ?
watchfires flickering far apart
by heaven , ereuthalion was the biggest , strongest man i ever killed , the huge lumbering sprawl of him stretching far and wide !
now as i lay asleep they seemed to stand before me , clear before my eyes , so vivid , washed in the light of the full moon flooding in through deepset windows
and sibyl , for you too , a magnificent sacred shrine awaits you in our kingdom
last , handsomest captain of them all , comes iulus riding a mount from sidon , radiant dido ’ s gift , a memento of the queen , a pledge of her affection
here they ’ re dredging a harbor , there they lay foundations deep for a theater , quarrying out of rock great columns to form a fitting scene for stages still to come
he lashed the team and on they flew to the ships , holding nothing back — that 's where their spirits drove them on to go
the rumor spread at once through trojan ranks that the day had come to build their destined city
then , heaping a mass of plunder seized in the latin rout , aeneas orders it borne home in a long cortege , adding the steeds and arms he stripped from foes
at that the white-armed goddess hera smiled and smiling , took the cup from her child 's hands
but the old and noble priam answered firmly , i will go
well let him go , i say !
then odysseus weighed out ten full bars of gold and led the princes back , laden with other gifts , and they set them down amid the meeting grounds
we give you glory — seize it in your hands !
for i am bound to you by my own strength , by oracles of the gods and by our fathers— blood-kin—and your own fame that echoes through the world
you , the only balm of my old age !
and thrusting it into hera 's outstretched hands she breathed her name in a throbbing , rising voice : here now , take this band , put it between your breasts — ravishing openwork , and the world lies in its weaving !
fling your sheets to the winds , sail free !
lie there , take their measure
a day will come when the trojan lords and captains send an immense dust storm swirling down the plain — with your own eyes you will see them break for troy , leaving your ships and shelters free and clear !
four warlords led their ranks , ten-ship flotillas each , and filling the decks came bands of epean fighters , two companies under thalpius and amphimachus , sons of the line of actor , one of eurytus , one of cteatus
men whose mattocks till the massic earth for wine , auruncans their fathers sent from the rising hills and sidicine flats close by , and men just come from cales , men who make their homes along the volturnus ’ shoals and beside them rough saticulans , squads of oscans
let all the etruscans join them at once as allies !
revere the gods , achilles !
all i ask is time , blank time : some rest from frenzy , breathing room till my fate can teach my beaten spirit how to grieve
nor do i exempt the italians
and so with men : as one generation comes to life , another dies away
who was moved by cassandra ’ s visions then ?
you wo not return , i know , your mission unfulfilled , whatever your eager heart desires to do
nothing has changed my mind
that man without a shred of decency in his heart
ah what joy to advance the banners , hear the trumpets blare !
and then , at first light , let the herald idaeus go to the beaked ships and tell the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , the offer of paris who caused our long hard campaign
what should he do ?
and with that telamonian ajax strode off with his brother teucer , his own father 's son , and pandion cradling teucer 's long curved bow
how can all achaeans be masters here in troy ?
her father and noble mother loved her dearly , the pride of their halls excelling all her age in beauty , works of the loom and good clear sense
pallas marches out to the center of the field and the blood runs cold in each arcadian heart
there , through its nine mouths as the mountain caves roar back , the river bursts out into full flood , a thundering surf that overpowers the fields
i am hardly the man to order men , against their will , to haul the oar-swept vessels out to sea
no use to you then , the fine lyre and these , these gifts of aphrodite , your long flowing locks and your striking looks , not when you roll and couple with the dust
at last the gods have called me down to death
the gallant wife in tears , longing for him , her wedded husband , the best of the achaeans — diomedes breaker of horses
urging so but his men already burned to drive the trojans off
nestor , the first to hear their thunder , shouted , friends — lords of the argives , all our captains , right or wrong , what can i say ?
leaving the council now with thousands in his wake , amid his immense cortege , aeneas gains the tomb and here he pours libations , each in proper order
how blind men ’ s minds to their fate and what the future holds , how blind to limits when fortune lifts men high
but the noble son of pelegon answered firmly , high-hearted son of peleus , why ask about my birth ?
hidden deep in a shady tree there grows a golden bough , its leaves and its hardy , sinewy stem all gold , held sacred to juno of the dead , proserpina
and here the trojan women are moving toward the temple of pallas , their deadly foe , their hair unbound as they bear the robe , their offering , suppliants grieving , palms beating their breasts but pallas turns away , staring at the ground
i swear by the gods , dear anna , by your sweet life , i arm myself with magic arts against my will
but nothing , no specter on earth has touched your heart with fear , not even typhoeus himself , towering up with weapons
no , you must turn back — soon as you bring the light of victory to the ships
do not steal on me in silence — what do you want ?
here in this grove a strange sight met his eyes and calmed his fears for the first time
we will never take the broad streets of troy
now deep in the heart of carthage stood a grove , lavish with shade , where the tyrians , making landfall , still shaken by wind and breakers , first unearthed that sign : queen juno had led their way to the fiery stallion ’ s head that signaled power in war and ease in life for ages
do not let him try to frighten me with his mighty hands — what does he take me for , some coward out-and-out ?
down to the god of death he goes , i tell you , down to the mighty gates but thrilled at heart — look at the escort i have sent him for the journey !
but the grim ferryman ushers aboard now these , now those , others he thrusts away , back from the water ’ s edge
hector leaping back in his chariot , swerving to fly , shouted out fresh orders — retreat , trojans , now !
some scatter back to their ships , making a run for shore and safety
once when achilles harried the breathless trojans , pounding their ranks against their walls , slaughtering thousands , rivers crammed with corpses groaned and the xanthus could find no channel rolling down to sea , and then as aeneas went up against the mighty achilles— hardly a match for the man ’ s gods , the man ’ s power— then i saved him , wrapped him into a fold of clouds , though i longed to crush their ramparts roots and all , the walls i built with my own hands—those lying trojans !
no river so wild , so frothing in spate , bursting its banks to overpower the dikes , anything in its way , its cresting tides stampeding in fury down on the fields to sweep the flocks and stalls across the open plain
no , there 's no great citadel standing near with towers where we could defend ourselves and troops could turn the tide
with you i will forsake the light of this life i hate—never in shackles live to see aeneas as my son !
he aimed and hurled and his spear 's long shadow flew — a clean hit , no miss , trained at the head of hector , his helmet ridge
nor will i permit a single immortal god to save the argive forces , not till achilles ' prayer has been fulfilled
at his command they raised this horse , this effigy , all to atone for the violated image of pallas , her wounded pride , her power—and expiate the outrage they had done
with that , standing over against the bull ’ s head steadied there , the battle ’ s prize , he drew the iron gauntlet back and rearing up for the blow , swings it square between both horns , crushing the skull and dashing out the brains , and dying , quivering , down on the ground the great beast sprawls
planting his body right in front , legs spread wide , his weight in the blow to give it total impact , hector hurled at the gates , full center , smashing the hinges left and right and the boulder tore through , dropped with a crash and both gates groaned and thundered — the doorbars could not hold , the planking shattered up in a flying storm of splinters under the rock 's force and hector burst through in glory , his face dark as the sudden rushing night but he blazed on in bronze and terrible fire broke from the gear that wrapped his body , two spears in his fists
now cupid is on the move , under her orders , bringing the tyrians royal gifts , his spirits high as achates leads him on
never a chance that i could win you over
come , let 's give him a prize , it 's only right — but second prize , of course — tydeus ' son must carry off the first
an olympian messenger came to me from zeus — i must go to achaea 's ships and ransom our dear son , bearing gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
like her to the life , immortal love invited , quickly — paris is calling for you , come back home !
zeus , father zeus , they say you excel all others
but granted that no one tempted you in the past , not in your great grief , no libyan suitor , and none before in tyre , you scorned iarbas and other lords of africa , sons bred by this fertile earth in all their triumph : why resist it now , this love that stirs your heart ?
but time and again we two have sworn our oaths in the eyes of all the gods — i and pallas athena — never to drive the fatal day away from the trojans , not even when all troy burns in the ramping flames when the warring sons of achaea burn her down !
let lavinia be his bride
a gift he will value highly
i am not bent on plunder stripped from a girl , no trophy over her corpse
or i who equipped the man with weapons , fanned the flames of war with lust ?
tarchon , on the watch for a welcome stretch of beach where the shoals don ’ t churn , no breakers booming low but a smooth unbroken groundswell glides toward the sand , abruptly swerves his prow around and spurs his shipmates : now , my chosen hands , you bend to your sturdy oars !
but hector is mortal
now— neither mighty juno nor saturn ’ s son , the father , gazes down on this with just , impartial eyes
i wish you would lingered deep with the deathless sea-nymphs , lived at ease , and peleus carried home a mortal bride
on the trojans came , straight for the rock-tight wall , raising rawhide shields and yelling their lungs out , grouped under captain asius , iamenus and orestes and asius ' own son adamas , thoon and oenomaus
men sprawling , sunk in their wine and sleep
no sons of atreus here , no spinner of tales , ulysses
so what if i am not a world-class man of war ?
my son , his tears brimming , father anchises started in , don ’ t press to know your people ’ s awesome grief
the kingdom of the dead so as he speaks in tears aeneas gives the ships free rein and at last they glide onto euboean cumae ’ s beaches
why keep flinging your wretched people into naked peril ?
from that point the men sent tydeus on ahead , bearing their message
landing , drawing lots for tomorrow ’ s stint at the oars , we stretch out in the lap of welcome land at water ’ s edge and scattered along the dry beach refresh ourselves as sleep comes streaming through our weary bodies
and even now the cavalry had come riding forth through the open gates , aeneas out in the lead , flanked by trusty achates , then other trojan captains , with pallas in command of the column ’ s center , pallas brilliant in battle cape and glittering inlaid armor
juno nodded assent to this , her spirit reversed to joy
— sleep cried , thrilled by the offer — swear to me by the incorruptible tides of styx , one hand grasping the earth that feeds mankind , the other the bright sea , that all may be our witness , all gods under earth that gather round king cronus !
all the while messapus is ordered to cordon off the gates with a sentry-line and gird the walls with fire
they bend hard to the oars and pull for all they ’ re worth , and the bronze hull shivers under their massive strokes and the deep sweeps by beneath them— gasping for breath , their chests wracked , mouths parched , sweat rivering down their backs , but blind chance brings that crew the prize they yearn for
they scoured it off , threw scourings in the surf and sacrificed to apollo full-grown bulls and goats along the beaten shore of the fallow barren sea and savory smoke went swirling up the skies
odysseus caught the signal , filled his cup and lifted it toward achilles , opening with this toast : your health , achilles !
nothing i said was meant in earnest , trust me , i mean you all the good will in the world
three brothers we are , all sprung from cronus , all of us brought to birth by rhea — zeus and i , hades the third , lord of the dead beneath the earth
on with it now — show us your strength , full force
and one lone footpath led toward the vineyard and down it the pickers ran whenever they went to strip the grapes at vintage — girls and boys , their hearts leaping in innocence , bearing away the sweet ripe fruit in wicker baskets
the trojans shuddered to see the serpent glistening , wriggling at their feet , a sign from storming zeus
hearing achilles , forth he came from his shelter , striding up like the deathless god of war but from that moment on his doom was sealed
even niobe with her lustrous hair remembered food , though she saw a dozen children killed in her own halls , six daughters and six sons in the pride and prime of youth
aeneas presents a pair of brazen cauldrons for third prize and two cups of hammered silver , ridged in sharp relief
but bent on glory hector answered the giant ajax taunt for taunt : enough of your blustering threats , you clumsy ox — what loose talk , what rant !
let the whole myrmidon army follow my command — i might bring some light of victory to our argives !
what if i face him out before the walls ?
now the moment calls
as for the gifts , here i am to produce them all , all that good odysseus promised you in full , the other day , when he approached your tents
it 's a welcome thing to make love with a woman
men as many as breakers rolling in from the libyan sea when savage orion sets low in the winter waves or dense as the ears of corn baked by an early sun on hermus ’ plain or lycia ’ s burnished fields
the father 's will was set on giving glory over to hector son of priam that he might hurl his torch at the beaked ships — the force of fire , quenchless , ravening fire , yes , and bring to its bitter end the disastrous prayer of thetis
so you can see the breed of tros 's team , their flair for their own terrain as they gallop back and forth , one moment in flight , the next in hot pursuit — i took them both from aeneas , driving terrors
i saw them heading first for the turn , by god , but i ca not find them now — anywhere — hard as i look , left and right , scanning the whole trojan plain
so now , menelaus o my king , you turned your shining eyes , scanning the crowds of comrades front and rear , trying to see if nestor 's son was still alive
and once they would heaped the mound they turned back home to troy , and gathering once again they shared a splendid funeral feast in hector 's honor , held in the house of priam , king by will of zeus
cassandra ’ s raving spurred him on !
and then lord nestor rose and spoke among the men : no more — or enormous sorrow comes to all achaea !
jove said no more
each captain killed his man
bear up now , despite your heartsick grief
patroclus stretched him out , knelt with a knife and cut the sharp , stabbing arrow out of eurypylus ' thigh and washed the wound clean of the dark running blood with clear warm water
breathing room in war is all too brief
and then by juno ’ s doors beneath the vaulted dome , flanked by an honor guard beside her lofty seat , the queen assumed her throne
yes , they fail to fulfill their promise sworn that day they sailed here from the stallion-land of argos : that not until you had razed the rugged walls of troy would they sail home again
they leave me to wander up and down , abandoned , lost at the house of death with the all-embracing gates
the first battalion was led by menesthius bright in bronze , son of spercheus river swelled by the rains of zeus and born by the lovely polydora , peleus ' daughter , when a girl and the god of a tireless river bedded down
the chief was helpless to rip it off his shoulders — enemy weapons jolted him back with so much force his legs buckled , the old driving power lost , no dash left to dive for a spear or dodge one
achilles strode off to his trim ships and shelters , back to his friend patroclus and their comrades
great as he is , what overweening arrogance !
may all the gods who help the trojans fall as hard when they battle argives armed for war — all as courageous , all as steadfast as aphrodite when she sped to ares ' side and faced my fury !
dardan fighters hand-to-hand — now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
dressed his body in deathless , ambrosial robes then sent him on his way with the wind-swift escorts , twin brothers sleep and death , who with all good speed set him down in lycia 's broad green land
hector seized the corpse 's head , would not let go — patroclus clung to a foot and other fighters clashed , trojans , argives , all in a grueling , maiming onset
just my spirit burning to muster troops for battle , rush with comrades up to the city ’ s heights , fury and rage driving me breakneck on as it races through my mind what a noble thing it is to die in arms !
you and your warring kings , your false alarms , you mockery of a prophet !
but now as i pitch at a third stalk , doubling my effort , knees bracing against the sand , struggling to pry it loose— shall i tell you or hold my tongue ? —i hear it , clearly , a wrenching groan rising up from the deep mound , a cry heaving into the air : why , aeneas , why mangle this wretched flesh ?
not forgetting to send his shipmates on the beaches twenty bulls and a hundred huge , bristling razorbacks and a hundred fatted lambs together with their mothers : gifts to make this day a day of joy
now i alone have the right to enter combat
hold dear the son we share , we love together
come say your parting salutes and leave my body so
this is the hunger he meant , this the last trial , the last limit set to our pains of exile
better that way by far than to have you strutting here , an outrage — a mockery in the eyes of all our enemies
heal our feuds at once !
think , even if he escapes the wrenching horrors of war against the argives , pain and labor will plague him all his days to come
there are the gates , facing us with their arch
for the good of all he urged them : agamemnon !
what a grief it will be to you through all the years to come
still round alcathous fighters kept on lunging in
and then and there , menelaus , the death-stroke would have blazed before your eyes — dead at the hands of hector , a far stronger man — if argive kings had not leapt up and caught you
you order me to explain apollo 's anger , the distant deadly archer ?
the gods are hard to handle — when they come blazing forth in their true power
like a giant breaker rearing up on the rangy seas , crashing over a ship 's sides , driven in by the winds and the blast builds the comber 's crushing impact — a hoarse roar !
old homes deserted , baring their necks , they loose their hair to the winds ; some fill the air with their high-pitched , trilling wails , decked in fawnskins , brandishing lances wound with vines
and after the coals sank in and the fires died down , they washed his embers , thirsty remains , with wine
this iarbas , driven wild , set ablaze by the bitter rumor , approached an altar , they say , as the gods hovered round , and lifting a suppliant ’ s hands , he poured out prayers to jove : almighty jove !
here the firegod dove from heaven ’ s heights
oenotrians settled it ; now we hear their descendants call their kingdom italy , after their leader , italus
seeing them die against the hollow ships , repaid for their offenses ?
climbing out of the breakers , there poseidon sat and pitied the argives beaten down by trojan troops and his churning outrage rose against the father
and as for our own healers , podalirius and machaon , one is back in the shelters , wounded , i think — machaon needs a good strong healer himself , he 's racked with pain
a crack of the lash — the team plunged to a run and on the stallions flew , holding nothing back as they winged between the earth and starry skies and gaining the slopes of ida with all her springs , the mother of wild beasts , they reached gargaron peak where the grove of zeus and zeus 's smoking altar stand
go through the ranks and rally all the troops
he had been mighty hector ’ s friend , by hector ’ s side in the rush of battle , shining with spear and trumpet both
but you , what following winds , what fates have sailed you here ?
first by far agamemnon lord of men sprang up and following him tydides , powerful diomedes , next the great and little ajax armed in fury , idomeneus after them and idomeneus ' good aide , meriones , a match for the butcher god of war , eurypylus after them , euaemon 's gallant son , thoas son of andraemon , odysseus out for exploit : all were roused to go up against prince hector
they refresh the banquet , bringing on the second course , a welcome savor , weighing the altars down with groaning platters
not far from there he had forged rome as well and the sabine women brutally dragged from the crowded bowl when the circus games were played and abruptly war broke out afresh , the sons of romulus battling old king tatius ’ hardened troops from cures
book twenty-four : achilles and priam
they are hard for mortal men to curb and drive , for all but achilles — his mother is immortal
those mares in front are the same that led before — they are eumelus ' mares , look , and there 's eumelus now , astride his chariot , gripping the reins himself !
you ’ d force the innocent harpies from their fathers ’ kingdom ?
with a trojan army marching at our side , think how the glory of carthage will tower to the clouds !
if i was a young man then , now old age dogs my steps
a stunned silence seized them all , struck dumb — achilles ' ringing denials overwhelmed them so
not even a hawk-eyed scout could still make out sarpedon , the man 's magnificent body covered over head to toe , buried under a mass of weapons , blood and dust
troy , home of the gods !
since here , they say , are the gates of death ’ s king and the dark marsh where the acheron comes flooding up , please , allow me to go and see my beloved father , meet him face-to-face
now , if in the years to come you will accord with me , my wide-eyed queen , throned with me in the gods ' decisive sessions , then poseidon , bent as he is to go his own way , must change at once and wrench his will to ours , to yours and mine united
the son of a great man , the mother who gave me life a deathless goddess
but it 's man-killing hector calling his trojans on , his war cries crashing round me , savage cries of his trojans sweeping the whole plain , victors bringing the argive armies to their knees
phoenician dido is in command , she sailed from tyre , in flight from her own brother
like a blast of the thracian northwind howling over the deep aegean , whipping the waves toward shore , wherever the winds burst down the clouds take flight through the sky , so turnus , wherever he hacks his path , the lines buckle in and the ranks turn tail and run as his own drive sweeps him on , his rushing chariot charging the gusts that toss his crest
the mast shuddered , the dove fluttered in fright and the whole arena round rang out with cheers
do i take flight alone , consorting with crews of trojan oarsmen in their triumph ?
so calchas read the omens
how she fumed , zeus 's child who showers arrows , she loosed a bristling wild boar , his tusks gleaming , crashing his savage , monstrous way through oeneus ' orchard , ripping up whole trunks from the earth to pitch them headlong , rows of them , roots and all , appleblossoms and all !
a deathtrap , no way out for the monster now !
no more escape for you — athena will kill you with my spear in just a moment
my other feats of arms will win me glory
soon as said they take their mark , ready , set— a sudden signal— go ! — and they break from the start , pouring over the course like a stormcloud streaking on , all eyes fixed on the goal , with nisus far in the lead , shooting out of the tight pack and faster than wind or the winged lightning—second , second at quite a gap , comes salius—next , and a good long way behind , euryalus coming third , and after euryalus , helymus , then diores flying hot on his heels and closer , closing , watch , breathing over his shoulder and if there had been more track to cover he would have caught and passed him or run him a dead heat
so please go home and tend to your own tasks , the distaff and the loom , and keep the women working hard as well
it 's not the hour to meet your doom , not yet
the stygian tide-pools trembled at your arrival , death ’ s watchdog cringed , sprawling over the heaps of half-devoured bones in his gory cave
mezentius cries , grinning through his rage : as for my own death , the father of gods and king of men will see to that
so aeneas , overpowered by missiles left and right , braves out the cloudburst of war till its thunder dies away and then he taunts lausus , threatens lausus : why hurry your death ?
the earth-shaker himself , trident locked in his grip , led the way , rocking loose , sweeping up in his breakers all the bastion 's strong supports of logs and stones the achaeans prized in place with grueling labor
so he said and the armies called assent to what he urged
strong as a boar he urged his frontline troops as meriones brought the rear battalions up
now fighter go against fighter , out for bloodshed !
here i thought i would punish paris for all his outrage — now my sword is shattered , right in my hands , look , my spear flew from my grip for nothing — i never hit him !
the bow slipped from his grip
the men gird up for the game , the coming feast , they skin the hide from the ribs , lay bare the meat
the lord of the war cry menelaus came uncalled , he knew at heart what weighed his brother down
when the trojans saw idomeneus fierce as fire , him and his aide-in-arms in handsome blazoned gear , they all cried out and charged them through the press and a sudden , pitched battle broke at the ships ' sterns
but as he turned back , his host spun out the tightest trap of all : picking the best men from lycia far and wide he set an ambush — that never came home again !
even the finest speaker finds intrusions hard
as soon as our ships had reached the high seas , no land in sight , no longer—water at all points , at all points the sky— looming over our heads a pitch-dark thunderhead brings on night and storm , ruffling the swells black
how do we know they are not about to attack us in the night ?
a terrible thing
you great walls of the dardans long renowned in war !
she no longer thinks to keep the affair a secret , no , she calls it a marriage , using the word to cloak her sense of guilt
urging so , with his own hands he carries vesta forth from her inner shrine , her image clad in ribbons , filled with her power , her everlasting fire
he rose up quickly and over his chest he pulled a battle-shirt , under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals , round him slung the glossy hide of a big tawny lion , swinging down to his heels , and grasped a spear
yoking the fields of others , hauling off the plunder ?
and dolon son of the herald kept on blurting , everything — anything — whatever will satisfy you !
their father lived in the fortress town of phera , a man of wealth and worth , born of alpheus river running wide through pylian hills , the stream that sired ortilochus to rule their many men
he left his team and burnished bronze car with an aide , eurymedon , ptolemaeus piraides ' son reining off to the side his snorting pair of stallions
like sheepdogs keeping watch on flocks in folds , a nervous , bristling watch when the dogs get wind of a wild beast rampaging down through mountain timber , crashing toward the pens , and the cries break as he charges , a din of men and dogs , and their sleep is broken , gone — and so the welcome sleep was routed from their eyes , guardsmen keeping the long hard watch that night
we fling open the gates and stream out , elated to see the greeks ’ abandoned camp , the deserted beachhead
there poseidon sat at ease with his deathless friends who spread unbroken shrouds of mist around their shoulders , while far on the other side the gods of troy sat down on the brows of sunlight hill , flanking you , apollo , god of the wild cry , and ares scourge of cities
he takes delight in the cape that bears his name
then , at last , the port of drepanum takes me in , a shore that brought no joy
we would come to the strong and storied house of peleus , out for recruits across achaea 's good green land
but now i will go for the others , anyone i can catch
the trojans echo back with a roar of joy , their spirits sky-high
that 's all i would ask
not to interrupt him , the only courteous thing
here in the presence of our united armed contingents let talthybius quickly prepare a wild boar for me — we must sacrifice to the sun and father zeus
nor did lerna ’ s hydra , heads swarming around you , strip you of your wits
not in the horror of battle , and that is why the whole city of troy mourns you now , my hector — you have brought your parents accursed tears and grief but to me most of all you have left the horror , the heartbreak !
there she found him , sweating , wheeling round his bellows , pressing the work on twenty three-legged cauldrons , an array to ring the walls inside his mansion
your wits are gone — where 's your respect for others ?
what could wound the queen of the gods with all her power ?
he ’ d barely ended when all at once the mist around them parted , melting into the open air , and there aeneas stood , clear in the light of day , his head , his shoulders , the man was like a god
like a tawny lion when hounds and country field hands drive him out of their steadings filled with cattle — they will never let him tear the rich fat from the oxen , all night long they stand guard but the lion craves meat , he lunges in and in but his charges gain him nothing , thick-and-fast from their hardy arms the javelins rain down in his face , and waves of blazing torches — these the big cat fears , balking for all his rage , and at dawn he slinks away , his spirits dashed
soiling his gray hair with dust , flinging both hands to the skies , he clings to his son ’ s body , crying : was i so seized by the lust for life , my son , i let you take my place before the enemy ’ s sword ?
meriones caught him quickly , running him down hard and speared him low in the right buttock — the point pounding under the pelvis , jabbed and pierced the bladder — he dropped to his knees , screaming , death swirling round him
but lord god apollo , gazing down now from the heights of pergamus , rose in outrage , crying down at the trojans , up and at them , you stallion-breaking trojans !
with that he tossed the bloody gear in the chariot , climbed aboard with his hands and feet dripping gore like a lion that rends and bolts a bull
and then through camp we took our evening meal by rank and file , and caught what sleep we could , each in his gear along the river rapids
and now he lies in the halls , broken with grisly age , but now my griefs are worse
but facing them the achaean ranks cried back , not forgetting their courage , braced hard for assault as the trojans ' bravest charged and roars from both armies struck the high clear skies , the lightning world of zeus
he rose up tall and challenged all the achaeans : now men come forward , fight to win this prize !
but pirous — aetolian thoas speared him as he swerved and sprang away , the lancehead piercing his chest above the nipple plunged deep in his lung , and thoas , running up , wrenched the heavy spear from the man 's chest , drew his blade , ripped him across the belly , took his life but he could not strip his armor
closing ranks we charge after him , into the thick of battle and face our first disaster
a happy hope flared up in the last two captains now , sergestus and mnestheus , to pass the flagging gyas
and now apollo turned to taunt achilles : why are you chasing me ?
at that command the dream went winging off , and passing quickly along the fast trim ships , made for the king and found him soon , sound asleep in his tent with refreshing godsent slumber drifted round him
she had no love for great acestes ’ city
i am certain he has not heard the dreadful news that his dear friend lies dead
that unholy man , so blind in his lust for gold he ran him through with a sword , then hid the crime for months , deaf to his sister ’ s love , her heartbreak
my courage renewed , i rush to relieve the palace , brace the defenders , bring the defeated strength
a call to arms and they pack in wedge formation bent on battle , advancing toward the walls in a dense fighting mass— in a moment you see ladders slanted , brands aflame
but the ocean king who grips and shakes the earth , rising up from the offshore swell , urged the argives , taking the build and tireless voice of calchas
and iris came on helen in her rooms
hector with that flashing helmet would meet his match in combat in a moment
we are all friends here — let me tell it now
oh escape from this savage land , i beg you , flee these grasping shores !
not when i loved acrisius ' daughter danae — marvelous ankles — and perseus sprang to life and excelled all men alive
no qualm in your heart for this ?
nor did i once extend a bridegroom ’ s torch or enter into a marriage pact with you
but as for stealing courageous hector 's body , we must abandon the idea — not a chance in the world behind achilles ' back
they had just gained the sacred sill when the virgin cries aloud : now is the time to ask your fate to speak !
i , betrayed so often by calm , deceptive skies !
well , here 's a tremendous work of battle , look , blazing before your eyes and just the sort you longed for all those days
and it strikes me , even me , as the better way
what good has it been to flee the plague of war , to slip through the thick of fires set by the greeks ?
she told no one what she saw , not even her sister
that spear i hurled is lying here on the ground
i warn you , soldiers — so help me it 's the truth — i will crush you with body-blows , i will crack your ribs to splinters !
and he went on to war as grim as murderous ares , his good son panic stalking beside him , tough , fearless , striking terror in even the combat-hardened veteran , yes , both of them marching out of thrace , geared to fight the ephyri or phlegians great with heart , but they turn deaf ears to the prayers of both sides at once , handing glory to either side they choose
but the leaves are light—if the door turns on its hinge , the slightest breath of air will scatter them all about and she never cares to retrieve them , flitting through her cave , or restore them to order , join them as verses with a vision
no more joy for us in the sumptuous feast when riot rules the day
i am glad to do it
often the armies brought this matter up against me — they would revile me in public
eyes blazing , athena answered , let him die a thousand deaths !
hoisting over the blaze a cauldron , filling it brimful with bathing water , they piled fresh logs beneath and lit them quickly
turnus , hurling the brothers amycus and diores off their mounts , attacks them on foot and one he strikes with a long spear , rushing at turnus , one he runs through with a sword and severing both their heads , he dangles them from his car as he carts them off in triumph dripping blood
is that why you beckon here beside me now with all the immortal cunning in your heart ?
or so they claim who watched him at his work
helen paused and the shrewd antenor carried on her story : straight to the point , my lady , very true
shorter than atreus ' son agamemnon , clearly , but broader across the shoulders , through the chest
the chiefs in the lead , messapus , ufens , mezentius , scorner of gods , call up forces from all quarters and strip the fields of men who worked the soil
now amarinceus ' son diores — fate shackled diores fast and a jagged rock struck him against his right shin , beside the ankle
but if we have lost our haven there , if libyan waters hold you now , my captain , best of the men of troy , and all our hopes for iulus have been dashed , at least we can cross back over sicilian seas , the straits we came from , homes ready and waiting , and seek out great acestes for our king
nor did paris linger long in his vaulted halls
if only odysseus and rugged diomedes were driving racers off the trojan lines , here , here and fast !
and those greeks we had put to rout , our ruse in the murky night stampeding them headlong on throughout the city—back they come , the first to see that our shields and spears are naked lies , to mark the words on our lips that jar with theirs
the lord of men agamemnon answered warmly , son of laertes , i delight to hear your counsel !
but one man , thersites , still railed on , nonstop
inside it was crisscrossed taut with many thongs , outside the gleaming teeth of a white-tusked boar ran round and round in rows stitched neat and tight — a master craftsman 's work , the cap in its center padded soft with felt
they will gladly sink to a knee and rest at home , i would say — whoever comes through alive from the heat of combat , out from under my spear !
laying hold of the yoke that bound his team , the goddess pallas started , so , tydeus ' son is half the size of his father , and he was short and slight — but tydeus was a fighter !
a laughingstock , shorn of glory , she came crawling in
rearing behind him pallas seized his fiery hair — only achilles saw her , none of the other fighters — struck with wonder he spun around , he knew her at once , pallas athena !
over them as a backdrop looms a quivering wood , above them rears a grove , bristling dark with shade , and fronting the cliff , a cave under hanging rocks with fresh water inside , seats cut in the native stone , the home of nymphs
no sooner were both men harnessed up beneath the roofs , priam and herald , minds set on the coming journey , than hecuba rushed up to them , gaunt with grief , her right hand holding a golden cup of honeyed wine so the men might pour libations forth at parting
and the old charioteer rose to the challenge
they are bone-weary from battle — you could roll those broken trojans back to troy , clear of our ships and shelters !
they toed the line — and broke flat out from the start and ajax shot ahead with quick odysseus coming right behind him , close as the weaver 's rod to a well-sashed woman 's breast when she deftly pulls it toward her , shooting the spool across the warp , still closer , pressing her breast — so close odysseus sprinted , hot on ajax ' heels , feet hitting his tracks before the dust could settle and quick odysseus panting , breathing down his neck , always forcing the pace and all the argives shouting , cheering him on as he strained for triumph , sprinting on and fast in the homestretch , spurting toward the goal odysseus prayed in his heart to blazing-eyed athena , hear me , goddess , help me — hurry , urge me on !
and what of your son , ascanius ?
at once he summons his friends , acestes first , to report the will of jove , his dear father ’ s commands and the firm resolve now settled in his mind
and now your honor preserves your resting place , and if such glory is any glory at all , your name marks out your bones in the great land of the west
so i can go at the trojans once again and test their strength and see if they still long to camp the night at the ships
seeing atrides hurt and speeding off the lines he gave a ringing shout to his troops and allies : trojans !
so come , young soldiers , welcome to our house
she is the last , they say , our mother earth produced
as a dust storm dark as night goes whirling toward the walls , the mothers stand at the lookouts , beating their breasts , raising the women ’ s shrilling wails to the starry sky
now throw helicon open , muses , launch your song !
she paused but zeus who commands the storm clouds answered nothing
this was the first cause of all the pain and struggle , this first kindled the country people ’ s lust for war
you see for yourself — no power left in the argives
i heard that you were dead
look at this fellow here , back he comes again , fleeing his fatal day — and i would sold him off as a slave in holy lemnos but the heaving gray salt sea ca not hold him back , though it stops whole fleets of men who buck its tides
not even devouring a city , the heart of the phrygian race , in all her hatred , dragging the remnant down through pains of every sort : it ’ s not enough for her
at other points on the line i have no fear of the trojans ' hands , invincible as they seem — troops who had stormed our massive wall in force — our men-at-arms will hold them all at bay
and his loving wife went home , turning , glancing back again and again and weeping live warm tears
and then to any power above , mindful , evenhanded , who watches over lovers bound by unequal passion , dido says her prayers
only this : the argives certain they would never flee the worst , they would perish then and there , but the hopes soared in every trojan 's heart to torch the ships and slaughter argive heroes — so ran their thoughts , closing for the kill
no one can get his fill of gazing at those eyes , terrible eyes , that face , the matted , bristling chest of the brute beast , its fiery maw burnt out
with that he stabbed at odysseus ' balanced shield , straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked and it flayed the skin clean off odysseus ' ribs but pallas athena would never let it pierce her hero 's vitals
he marched out at once and came on crowds , menacing bands of thebans feasting away in the halls of mighty eteocles
many a victim will fall before your altars , we ’ ll slaughter them for you !
and moved at the sight , the good soldier patroclus burst out in grief with a flight of winging words , poor men !
what disgrace — a marvel right before my eyes !
so i was saved from the deep , the shores of the strophades first to take me in
be that fighter you claimed to be in all the years gone by
is it all lost now ?
beat him back , quickly !
the end closed in around him , swirling down his eyes , choking off his breath
how he rejoiced that day , questioning me in his halls , when he learned the blood and birth of all the argives
this is the gear your brother eryx used to wield , look , still crusted with blood and spattered brains— with these he stood up against great hercules , and i used to wear them too , when the blood ran warmer in me , made me strong before old age , my rival , flecked my brows with gray
then and there he would have struck achilles lunging in , the rock would have hit him square in casque or shield , the gear would have warded off grim death , and achilles , closing , would have slashed his life away with a well-honed blade — if the god of earthquakes had not marked it quickly and called the gods at once who grouped around him : now , i tell you , my heart aches for great aeneas !
and then , with the holy rites performed in full , they turned back to the city
you will never take the prize unless you take the oath !
dread what comrades say of you here in bloody combat !
and now aeneas sees in the valley ’ s depths a sheltered grove and rustling wooded brakes and the lethe flowing past the homes of peace
in high spirits alert your men and arm them , move them out through the gates to the field of battle !
escaping that flood and sailing here over many barren seas , now all we ask is a modest resting place for our fathers ’ gods , safe haven on your shores , water , and fresh air that ’ s free for all to breathe
and he came on tydeus ' son , impetuous diomedes standing by in his bolted car behind his team with sthenelus flanked beside him , capaneus ' son
come , friend , you too must die
and now , what 's more , the courage inside my chest is racing faster for action , full frontal assault — feet quiver beneath me , hands high for the onset !
constant sprays of dust kept pelting back on the driver , the chariot sheathed in gold and tin careering on in the plunging stallions ' wake , its spinning rims hardly leaving a rut behind in the thin dust as the team thundered in — a whirlwind finish !
but now venus distills a deep , soothing sleep into iulus ’ limbs , and warming him in her breast the goddess spirits him off to her high idalian grove where beds of marjoram breathe and embrace him with aromatic flowers and rustling shade
you would set him free from all the pains of death ?
how they would yearn , now , in the world above to endure grim want and long hard labor !
big epeus hefted the iron , swung and heaved it — and comrades burst out laughing
and anchises ' gallant son did not resist
come — see if we can arm the achaeans for assault
they can not see the brow of my helmet flash before their eyes — oh they would soon run for their lives and choke the torrent-beds of the field with all their corpses if only the mighty agamemnon met me with respect : now , as it is , they are fighting round our camp !
better for us that way , by far , if we yield his corpse to the stallion-breaking trojans , all to drag him back to troy and win the glory
speeding down in a flash from mount olympus ' summit hera reached achaean argos in no time , where , she knew for a fact , the hardy wife of sthenelus , perseus ' own son , was about to bear her child , but only seven months gone
for hard on the heels of hector 's death your death must come at once —
so they wept , the two of them crying out to their dear son , both pleading time and again but they could not shake the fixed resolve of hector
men surrendered their own sweet lives or dragged their decrepit bodies on and on
now priam rose in their midst and took his leave : hear me , trojans , achaeans geared for combat — home i go to windy ilium , straight home now
i will bring him down tomorrow
— then veering away himself , back again to grapple frontline troops
you have no mercy , none for dying trojans
hardly the sound of joy
he urged her on : take flight from our homeland , quick !
and hector held fast , he never let go of the high stern , he hugged its horn , arms locked in a death-grip , crying out to trojans , bring fire !
and then and there the achaeans would have taken the lofty gates of troy if apollo had not driven prince agenor at them , antenor 's son , a courageous , rugged soldier
i swear i will never mutilate you — merciless as you are — if zeus allows me to last it out and tear your life away
where ’ s he rushing now ?
and now it was ajax ' turn to shout at brave polydamas , think it over , polydamas , tell the truth , my friend — a decent bargain , no ?
perceiving at once that this was all pretense , a ruse to shift the kingdom of italy onto libyan shores , venus countered juno : now who ’ d be so insane as to shun your offer and strive with you in war ?
how long i have yearned to tell you , show them to you , face-to-face , yes , as i count the tally out of all my children ’ s children
if i voyage back to the fatherland i love , my pride , my glory dies
and across the onslaught zeus swept murderous night to make the pitched battle over his own dear son a brutal , blinding struggle
fight this way , if the argives still obey you , then you can see which captain is a coward , which contingent too , and which is loyal , brave , since they will fight in separate formations of their own
and hera endured it too , that time amphitryon 's son , mighty heracles hit her deep in the right breast with a three-barbed shaft , and pain seized her , nothing calmed the pain
those were my very thoughts , winging down from olympus into the midst of trojans and achaeans
what to commend first ?
i claim i am far greater than he in striking force , i am the first-born too
and once the surf had scoured the thick caked sweat from their limbs and the two fighters cooled , their hearts revived and into the polished tubs they climbed and bathed
his eyes narrow , gauging the length his spear will need , he cries : let this right arm—my only god—and the spear i hurl be with me now !
never pausing , the swift runner sprang to his feet and slaughtered a white sheep as comrades moved in to skin the carcass quickly , dress the quarters well
many were wounded , flesh ripped by the ruthless bronze whenever some fighter wheeled and bared his back but many right through the buckler 's hide itself
and yet minerva could burn the fleet to ash and drown my argive crews in the sea , and all for one , one mad crime of a single man , ajax , son of oileus !
patroclus slashed his right shoulder and down he went , his back slamming the dust with a jolting groan as companions panicked round him — brave paeonians — patroclus whipped the terror in all their hearts when he killed the chief who topped them all in battle
what agonies must i suffer now , now you are dead and gone ?
then nothing could keep me there , my blood so fired up
i ’ d grant that to the living too
a rout — not even the die-hard lycians stood their ground , they all scattered in panic , down to the last man when they saw their royal king speared in the heart , sarpedon sprawled there in the muster of the dead , for men by the squad had dropped across his corpse once zeus stretched tight the lethal line of battle
remind him i was never at aulis , never swore a pact with the greeks to rout the trojan people from the earth !
so the old man told you
the goddess ' voice — he knew it , mounted at once as odysseus whacked the stallions smartly with his bow and they made a run for achaea 's rapid ships
and now they would have jumped up , gone for the third fall if achilles himself had not stepped in and stopped them : no more struggling — do not kill yourselves in sport !
such fury ’ s beyond me— no doubt she has her reasons
saturn ’ s son , the king of the deep , complied : by all rights , cytherea , you should trust my realm , it gave you birth
no joining ranks with us as we fight to wipe them out , these insolent trojans , stretch them out in the dust with all their sons and all their honored wives !
so come , wait while i get this war-gear on , or you go on ahead and i will follow — i think i can overtake you
the first to hold a consul ’ s power and ruthless axes , then , when his sons foment rebellion against the city , their father summons them to the executioner ’ s block in freedom ’ s noble name , unfortunate man
so the front gave ground and flashing hector too , though only as far as a long slim spear can fly when a man tests his hurling strength in the games or in war when enemy fighters close to crush his life — so far the trojans gave as the argives drove them back
they lifted off its hook a boxwood yoke for the mules , its bulging pommel fitted with rings for guide-reins , brought out with the yoke its yoke-strap nine arms long and wedged the yoke down firm on the sanded , tapered pole , on the front peg , and slipped the yoke-ring onto its pin , strapped the pommel with three good twists , both sides , then lashed the assembly round and down the shaft and under the clamp they made the lashing fast
so he prayed , grasping the altar while the sibyl gave her answer : born of the blood of gods , anchises ’ son , man of troy , the descent to the underworld is easy
put your mind at rest
be on your guard
following them comes aventinus , handsome hercules ’ handsome son , parading his victor ’ s team across the field , his chariot crowned with the victor ’ s palm , his shield emblazed with his father ’ s sign : the hydra ’ s hundred snakes , the serpents twisting round
but make this glorious hector your main concern , rouse his breakneck courage till , racing in terror , the argives reach the fleet and the hellespont in rout
we blanch at the sight , we scatter
these were the words that fanned her sister ’ s fire , turned her doubts to hopes and dissolved her sense of shame
and achilles placed the trophy in nestor 's hands
headlong down aeneas smashes the braggart with a rock , a whirling boulder ’ s power that splays him on the ground , snarled in the reins and yoke as the wheels roll him on and under their thundering hoofbeats both his galloping horses— all thought of their master vanished—trample him to death
cut off from you with a charge like that , dear boy ?
or follow them out with all my troops of tyrians thronging the decks ?
and soon he came to priam 's palace , that magnificent structure built wide with porches and colonnades of polished stone
evadne , pasiphaë , and laodamia walking side by side , and another , a young man once , a woman now , caeneus , turned back by fate to the form she bore at first
so long as he sees lord marshal agamemnon storming among the champions , mowing columns down in blood , hector must hold back , command the rest of his men to fight the enemy , stand their headlong charge
like a girl , a baby running after her mother , begging to be picked up , and she tugs her skirts , holding her back as she tries to hurry off — all tears , fawning up at her , till she takes her in her arms
but over against him came achilles rearing like some lion out on a rampage , and a whole town of men has geared for the hunt to cut him down : but at first he lopes along , all contempt , till one of the fast young hunters spears him — then
but rousing himself from sleep , the divine voice swirling round him , atrides sat up , bolt awake , pulled on a soft tunic , linen never worn , and over it threw his flaring battle-cape , under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals , across his shoulder slung his silver-studded sword
the fighter turned on his heels and took his stand , once he reached that wedge of argive comrades
soaring home to olympus , she rejoined the gods aloft in the halls of zeus whose shield is thunder
so they harangued each other to a standstill
antilochus listened closely , hating every word
neither father almighty nor the fates were dead against troy ’ s standing any longer or priam ’ s living on for ten more years
brilliant achilles can drive them out of ilium now !
down they crash on the sea , the eastwind , southwind , all as one with the southwest ’ s squalls in hot pursuit , heaving up from the ocean depths huge killer-breakers rolling toward the beaches
like a mother bird hurrying morsels back to her unfledged young — whatever she can catch — but it 's all starvation wages for herself
can you see that sentry crouched at the entrance ?
grim repose and an iron sleep press down his eyes and shut their light in a night that never ends
with that prayer , she poured a libation to the gods , tipping wine on the board , and tipping it , she was first to take the bowl , brushing it lightly with her lips , then gave it to bitias—laughing , goading him on and he took the plunge , draining the foaming bowl , drenching himself in its brimming , overflowing gold , and the other princes drank in turn
men — let one of them die , another live , however their luck may run
but no , no joy did even powerful hyperenor , breaker of horses , get from his young strength when he scorned me , stood up to me , reviling me as the weakest fighter in all achaea 's armies
you have destroyed your life , my sister , mine too , your people , the lords of sidon and your new city here
and now with a deep groan and pounding both thighs asius son of hyrtacus cried in anguish , father zeus — so even you are an outright liar after all !
and helen of argos ?
now here turnus heads , by a track he knows by heart and staking his ground , he lurks in the woods , in ambush
what a price in bloodshed , turnus , you will pay me soon !
better that way by far , to journey home in the beaked ships of war
but you launch out on your journey , tear your sword from its sheath , aeneas
with that she flung a torch at the prince and drove it home in his chest to smoke with a hellish black glare
juno replies in tears : what if your heart should grant what you begrudge in words , and the life of turnus were firmly set for years to come ?
and i , i was the first to let my anger flare
as a father weeps when he burns his son 's bones , dead on his wedding day , and his death has plunged his parents in despair
down he leapt from his chariot fully armed , hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face
men went cramming back to the safe side , back from the killing heat but under the sudden lurch of weight the tower came toppling down , making the whole wide heaven thunder back its crash
this head—it ’ s all you bring me back , my son ? — it ’ s all that i followed , crossing land and sea ?
so with a shout he surged ahead and his gallant cohort followed
hector missed nothing — that was a goddess ' call
writhe with shame at the thought patroclus may be sport for the dogs of troy !
would to god they had
but we dissolved in tears , my wife , creusa , ascanius , the whole household , begging my father not to pull our lives down with him , adding his own weight to the fate that dragged us down
when the time arrives to crown your words with action
oh you return to your father , his great grief and glory !
if only jove is with us now , the third dawn will find us beached on the shores of crete
but now 's the time for the younger men to lock in rough encounters , time for me to yield to the pains of old age
but a whole battalion marching out of the camp comes massing hard against him—not even juno dares reinforce his power to counterattack
myself , if the gods on high had wished me to live on , they would have saved my palace for me here
but the queen from her high tower , catching sight of the morning ’ s white glare , the armada heading out to sea with sails trimmed to the wind , and certain the shore and port were empty , stripped of oarsmen— three , four times over she beat her lovely breast , she ripped at her golden hair and oh , by god , she cries , will the stranger just sail off and make a mockery of our realm ?
and a brace of fighters , chromius , strong aretus flanked their attack and the trojans had high hopes of killing the men and driving off the massive stallions
like a bull rising head and shoulders over the herds , a royal bull rearing over his flocks of driven cattle — so imposing was atreus ' son , so zeus made him that day , towering over fighters , looming over armies
flimsy and futile , not worth a second thought
be kind , whoever you are , relieve our troubled hearts
down in a mass the trojans pounded — hector led them in , charging in as a heavy surf roars in against the rip at a river 's mouth , swelled with rains from zeus , and on either side the jutting headlands bellow back at the booming sea with matching thunder — in they came , the trojans roaring in
where raging hector lies , pierced by achilles ’ spear , where mighty sarpedon lies , where the simois river swallows down and churns beneath its tides so many shields and helmets and corpses of the brave !
i myself am a stranger , utterly at a loss , trekking over this wild libyan wasteland , forced from europe , asia too , an exile— venus could bear no more of his laments and broke in on his tale of endless hardship : whoever you are , i scarcely think the powers hate you : you enjoy the breath of life , you ’ ve reached a tyrian city
or weeping over the argives , are you ?
standing far from the war and all its heartbreak hector exchanged his armor , handing his own gear to his battle-hungry troops to return to holy troy , and donned the deathless arms of peleus ' son achilles , arms the gods of the sky once gave his loving father — and peleus passed them on to his son when he grew old but the son would not grow old in his father 's armor
lunging she kills a pair of massive trojans , butes and orsilochus
and the powerful polypoetes ' men sprang up to bear the king 's trophy back to their hollow ships
antenor could slip out from under the greek siege , then make his passage through the illyrian gulfs and , safe through the inlands where the liburnians rule , he struggled past the timavus river ’ s source
hold firm with me — we will fight this wild maniac off the old man here !
an average man would strain to lift it off the table when it was full , but nestor , old as he was , could hoist it up with ease
all launch in as one , whipping the whole sea to foam with tugging , thrashing oars and cleaving triple beaks as they make a run for open sea
filled with resolve , he braced , waiting achilles , his warrior blood incensed
— neither i nor your wife , that warm , generous woman
turnus , surrender to king and country their due rights !
why , i have amathus , paphus ’ heights , and cythera too , an idalian mansion—there with his weapons laid away , let him live his life out , all unsung
nor does the spirit urge me on that way
in silence they piled the corpses on the pyre , their hearts breaking , burned them down to ash and returned to sacred troy
i am splattered with blood and filth — how could i pray to the lord of storm and lightning ?
it did bore through two plies but three were left , since the crippled smith had made it five plies thick with two of bronze on the outside , inside two of tin , between them one of gold where the ashen spear held fast
that 's what we need now , you and i both , and cunning tactics too
while vulcan , the lord of lemnos , spurs the work below that aeolian coast , the life-giving light and birdsong under the eaves at crack of dawn awake evander from sleep in his humble lodge
her wails dashed their spirits , a spasm of sorrow went throbbing through them all
some god will grant us an end to this as well
and the love you bore me once , where has it all gone ?
her armies have taken heart
it ’ s no long journey
i am achilles ' aide , you see , one and the same good warship brought us here
they are calling for you now , commanders of both armies , stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze — come down to the plain so you can seal our oaths
the right time for war will come—don ’ t rush it now— one day when savage carthage will loose enormous ruin down on the roman strongholds , breach and unleash the alps against her walls
with that , he whips his warhorse into the press , braced to die himself , he rushes venulus headlong , sweeps him off his mount and hugging his enemy tight to his chest with his clenched right arm , gallops away with him , racing off full tilt
both sides of the harbor , rock cliffs tower , crowned by twin crags that menace the sky , overshadowing reaches of sheltered water , quiet and secure
but i can see him — i recognize machaon myself , the expert healer
they dragged the hero cebriones out from under the pelting shafts and trojans ' piercing cries and they tore the handsome war-gear off his back and patroclus charged the enemy , fired for the kill
can ’ t you hear the westwind ruffling to speed you on ?
patroclus hurled next , the bronze launched from his hand — no miss , a mortal hit
and here anchises , his vision told in full , escorts his son and sibyl both and shows them out now through the ivory gate
and the winds swung round and headed home again , over the thracian sea , and the heaving swells moaned
worse , there was a marble temple in her palace , a shrine built for her long-lost love , sychaeus
they meet and grasp right hands and sitting there in the open court , are free at last to indulge in frank discussion
they lifted golden beakers , pledging each other warmly , gazing down on troy
at last he ventured a few words : i
mid-sea there lies the sacred island of delos , loved by the nereids ’ mother , aegean neptune too
odius and epistrophus led the halizonians out of alybe miles east where the mother lode of silver came to birth
as soon as idomeneus reached his well-built shelter he strapped his burnished armor round his body , grasped two spears and out he ran like a lightning bolt the father grips and flings from brilliant olympus , a dazzling sign to men — a blinding forked flash
go — the achaeans all will honor you like a god !
with a deafening roar the trojans all come pouring in through the gates for shelter , mount the ramparts now
hector slashed eioneus ' throat with a sharp spear , ripped him under the helmet 's hammered bronze rim — his legs collapsed in death
— or must they all die now , beaten down by his spear ?
so aeneas says , feeding his spirit on empty , lifeless pictures , groaning low , the tears rivering down his face as he sees once more the fighters circling troy
and this , at least , may comfort you for a death so cruel , unlucky boy : you went down under the hand of great aeneas
unless it 's a god who smolders at our troops , enraged at a rite we failed — when a god 's enraged there 's thunder at our heads
but the son unlike the father , not content with his forebears ’ holdings , even now held sway over broader realms : the sarrastian clans , their meadows washed by the sarnus , men from rufrae , batulum and celemna ’ s farms , and soldiers overseen by the high walls of abella rife with apples , fighters who whirl the barbed lance , teutonic style , their heads wrapped with the bark they strip from cork-trees , bronze shields gleaming—gleaming bronze , their swords
if only we lay our hands on these , i am filled with hope they will take to their racing ships this very night !
then over his broad brow agamemnon set his helmet fronted with four knobs and forked with twin horns and the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror
with equal zeal he rallies messapus , rallies allied chiefs and spurring them into battle , marches on the foe
the big oaken axle groaned beneath the weight , bearing a great man and a terrifying goddess — and pallas athena seized the reins and whip , lashing the racing horses straight at ares
anchises ' son echepolus gave agamemnon blaze , a gift that bought him off from the king 's armies bound for windy troy : he would stay right where he was , a happy man , since zeus had given him vast wealth and he lived in style on sicyon 's broad dancing rings
your love for me , if it held the force it once held and should hold still , you ’ d never deny me this , all-powerful one : the power to spirit turnus clear of battle , save him all unscathed for his father , daunus
out with it now , calchas
and uncontrollable laughter broke from the happy gods as they watched the god of fire breathing hard and bustling through the halls
she rages in helpless frenzy , blazing through the entire city , raving like some maenad driven wild when the women shake the sacred emblems , when the cyclic orgy , shouts of bacchus !
but euphorbus who hurled the lethal ashen spear would not neglect his kill , patroclus ' handsome body
over and over father , the old spearman lycaon urged me , setting out from his well-built halls , take those teams and cars , he told me , amount up , lead the trojans into the jolting shocks of battle !
so now , you see , i have given ground myself and told my comrades to mass around me here
both doomed to stain red with our blood the same plot of earth , a world away in troy !
i ’ ll take him on , i will !
now my spirit stirs me to meet you face-to-face
you immortal beasts who never age or die ?
no shame in running , fleeing disaster , even in pitch darkness
then tactful odysseus led her up to the altar , placing her in her loving father 's arms , and said , chryses , the lord of men agamemnon sent me here to bring your daughter back and perform a sacrifice , a grand sacrifice to apollo — for all achaea 's sake — so we can appease the god who 's loosed such grief and torment on the argives
most terrifying man alive !
suddenly down from the mountain 's rocky crags poseidon stormed with giant , lightning strides and the looming peaks and tall timber quaked beneath his immortal feet as the sea lord surged on
and what 's more , he advises all the rest , 'sail home now
he scanned the vaulting skies as his voice rang in prayer : zeus be my witness first , the highest , best of gods !
you too , you gods and goddesses , all who could never suffer troy and troy ’ s high glory , spare the people of pergamum now , it ’ s only right
the trojans have settled down secure in the tiber channel they so craved , safe from the waves—and me
plenty of argive women wait in hellas and in phthia , daughters of lords who rule their citadels in power
but aeneas , no less bent on meeting up with the enemy , stalks his victim , circling round him , turn by turn and his shrill cries call him through the broken ranks
to him i will give two hundred horsemen now , fighting hearts of oak—our best—and pallas will give you two hundred more , in pallas ’ name
then , by heaven , the tireless fire can strike his corpse — the sooner to burn patroclus from our sight — and the men turn back to battles they must wage
take back to your king this answer i give you now
i pray you , calliope—muses—inspire me as i sing what carnage and death the sword of turnus spread that day , what men each fighter speeded down to darkness
their wedding it will be !
so aeneas begins , and so latinus follows , eyes lifted aloft , his right hand raised to the sky : i swear by the same , aeneas , earth and sea and stars , by latona ’ s brood of twins , by janus facing left and right , by the gods who rule below and the shrine of ruthless death , may the father hear my oath , his lightning seals all pacts !
struggling for breath , you answered , patroclus o my rider , hector !
you are no bulwark come out of lycia , i can tell you — no help to trojans here
suddenly hercules ignited in rage , in black fury and seizing his weapons and weighted knotted club , he made for the hill ’ s steep heights at top speed
the sun went down
at once the winds whip up the sea , huge waves heaving , strewing , flinging us down the sheer abyss , the cloudbanks swallowing up the daylight , rain-soaked night wipes out the sky and flash on flash of lightning bursts from the torn clouds— we ’ re whirled off course , yawing blind in the big waves
— or heading home to troy , now they have trounced our armies ?
it 's not fair when the other gods have launched themselves in war
come , raise that scepter and swear you will give me the battle-team and the burnished brazen car that carry great achilles — i will be your spy
or you , fabricius , reared from poverty into power ?
our ships were no sooner hauled onto dry land , our young crewmen busy with weddings , plowing the fresh soil while i was drafting laws and assigning homes , when suddenly , no warning , out of some foul polluted quarter of the skies a plague struck now , a heartrending scourge attacking our bodies , rotting trees and crops , one whole year of death
— now that battle is set to burst in flames between them !
mezentius , vaunting , pries the spear from orodes ’ body
four times it lurched to a halt at the very brink of the gates—four times the armor clashed out from its womb
atreus ’ son , menelaus , right up to the pillars of proteus—long an exile now
at once they took two lords of the realm and seized their car , the two good sons of merops out of percote harbor , merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts
and a man may say , who sees you streaming tears , 'there is the wife of hector , the bravest fighter they could field , those stallion-breaking trojans , long ago when the men fought for troy
now he found himself in the thick of turnus ’ thousands , latin battalions crowding , pressing at all points— as a wild beast snared in a closing ring of hunters , raging against their weapons flings itself at death , staring doom in the face , leaping straight at the spears— just so wild the young soldier leaps at the enemy ’ s center , rushing at death where he sees the spearheads densest
racing away , but where ?
three times mezentius rides around him , hurling his weapons , keeping the trojan on his left ; three times aeneas wheels round with him , bearing a grisly thicket of lances bristling on his shield
but i will go back to the great city of king priam and bring some joy to the men of troy and trojan women trailing their long robes
no long hunt for the foe
come , up with you , whip an arrow at this invincible menelaus — now !
tearing sword from sheath like a lightning flash , he hacks the mooring lines with a naked blade
with that , he stamped his left foot on the corpse and stripped away the sword-belt ’ s massive weight engraved with its monstrous crime : how one night , their wedding night , that troop of grooms was butchered , fouling their wedding chambers with pools of blood— all carved by clonus , eurytus ’ son , in priceless gold
look , the night comes at last
just one is lost
you feckless , craven—have you no pity ?
in the early days on phrygian ida ’ s slopes when aeneas first built his fleet , gearing up for the high seas , they say the berecynthian mother of gods herself appealed to powerful jove with pleading words : grant this prayer , my son , that your loving mother makes to you , since now you rule on olympus ’ heights
lagus , lured on by a harsh fate
think : it ’ s not that beauty , helen , you should hate , not even paris , the man that you should blame , no , it ’ s the gods , the ruthless gods who are tearing down the wealth of troy , her toppling crown of towers
here venus , over against her , juno gazing down , as tisiphone seethes amid the milling thousands , that livid , lethal fury
a mere seven , battered by wind and wave , survived the worst
and hector rushed to tear the helmet off his head , snug on amphimachus ' brows , the gallant soldier — hector rushing in and ajax lunged with a spear yet the burnished weapon could not pierce his skin , hector 's whole body was cased in tremendous bronze
i hug your knees — mercy !
do you bring peace or war ?
up with you , son of venus !
and the sons of tyrrhus nursed it with father tyrrhus , who kept the royal herds , charged with tending the broad , spreading pastures
he killed in a blur of kills — thersilochus , mydon , astypylus , mnesus , thrasius , aenius and ophelestes — still more paeonian men the runner would have killed if the swirling river had not risen , crying out in fury , taking a man 's shape , its voice breaking out of a whirlpool : stop , achilles !
cursed in your own courage !
no gear for a mortal man to wear , i would say , it 's fit for the deathless gods !
i must obliterate every trace of the man , the curse , and the priestess shows the way !
he spotted the great and little ajax , gluttons for battle , flanking teucer fresh from his shelter , side-by-side
i look for no joy in life—the gods have ruled that out— just to bear the news to my son among the dead
or fear to make our home on western soil ?
yes , but lausus— weeping comrades are bearing his lifeless body home on his shield , a great soldier taken down by a great wound
but those treasures i once hauled home from argos , i will return them all and add from my own stores
cattle and fat sheep can all be had for the raiding , tripods all for the trading , and tawny-headed stallions
but you , you hold in check that proud , fiery spirit of yours inside your chest !
book nineteen : the champion arms for battle
three times he charged with the headlong speed of ares , screaming his savage cry , three times he killed nine men
others , cloaked in their sacred aprons , brows wreathed in verbena , brought out spring water and sacramental fire
as the bull a marauding lion cuts from the herd , tawny and greathearted among the shambling cattle , dies bellowing under the lion 's killing jaws — so now sarpedon , captain of lycia 's shieldsmen , died at patroclus ' hands and died raging still , crying out his beloved comrade 's name : glaucus — oh dear friend , dear fighter , soldier 's soldier !
now for courage , now the steady heart !
raising his spear , the lord of the war cry drove it home , planting it deep down in the earth that feeds us all and with winning words he called out to glaucus , the young captain , splendid — you are my friend , my guest from the days of our grandfathers long ago !
the goddess of the glistening feet replied , yes , my son , you are right
they are forging one tremendous shield , one against all the latin spears—welding seven plates , circular rim to rim
suddenly , look , a son of priam , polites , just escaped from slaughter at pyrrhus ’ hands , comes racing in through spears , through enemy fighters , fleeing down the long arcades and deserted hallways—badly wounded , pyrrhus hot on his heels , a weapon poised for the kill , about to seize him , about to run him through and pressing home as polites reaches his parents and collapses , vomiting out his lifeblood before their eyes
and father beamed , seeing how much i would won , a young soldier out on his first campaign
sentries take up posts , squads fronting the trench we dug outside the rampart
he will show no mercy , no respect for me , my rights — he will cut me down straight off — stripped of defenses like a woman once i have loosed the armor off my body
but soon as they were a spear-cast off or less he saw them — enemies — quick as a flash he sprang , fleeing for dear life — they sprang in pursuit as a pair of rip-tooth hounds bred for the hunt and flushing fawn or hare through a woody glen keep closing for the kill , nonstop and the prey goes screaming on ahead — so odysseus raider of cities and diomedes cut him off from his own lines , coursing him , closing nonstop with the trojan about to break in on the line of sentries , racing fast for the ships — when athena poured fresh strength in tydeus ' son so no achaean could beat him out for the glory of hitting dolon first , diomedes come in second
he let go of the spear , he sank back down
look , dear friends have come our way — i must be sorely needed now — my dearest friends in all the achaean armies , even in my anger
better , pity me , winds !
and tyrians join them , bustling through the doors , filling the hall with joy , to take invited seats on brocaded couches
now as he scanned across the trojan plain agamemnon marveled in horror at those fires , a thousand fires blazing against the walls of troy , and the shrill of pipes and flutes and low roar of men
i won ’ t hold you , i won ’ t even refute you—go ! — strike out for italy on the winds , your realm across the sea
but if someone else in the royal halls would curse me , one of your brothers or sisters or brothers ' wives trailing their long robes , even your own mother — not your father , always kind as my own father — why , you would restrain them with words , hector , you would win them to my side
what disgrace it will be — shame , cringing shame if not one danaan now steps up to battle hector
we claim we are far , far greater than our fathers
this is the sum of it
never fear my orders
then far off in the land of argos you must live , laboring at a loom , at another woman 's beck and call , fetching water at some spring , messeis or hyperia , resisting it all the way — the rough yoke of necessity at your neck
so all day long for the men of war the fighting raged , grim and grueling , relentless , drenching labor , nonstop , and the knees , shins and feet that upheld each fighter , their hands , their eyes , ran with the sweat of struggle over the great runner achilles ' steadfast aide-in-arms — an enormous tug-of-war
ida the huntress sent him , quick as the wind with spears and winging arrows , and right beside him came his friend , euryalus
so some trojan will trumpet — let the great earth gape and take me down that day !
the nymph of the sea with sleek and lustrous locks
a heavy blow to the argives , one of the brave ones down
he fulfills the plans of thetis who cupped his chin in her hand and kissed his knees , begging zeus to exalt achilles scourge of cities
the king ushered us into generous colonnades , in the heart of the court we offered bacchus wine and feasted from golden plates , all cups held high
the last gifts from your own people
her eyes bright , athena soared away and tydeus ' son went charging back to the front line of champions
for years now , i ’ ve lingered out my life , despised by the gods , a dead weight to men , ever since the father of gods and king of mortals stormed at me with his bolt and scorched me with its fire
there is no fighting defeated men , robbed of the light
so they grieved at troy while achaea 's troops pulled back
they swung down from their chariots onto earth to hear what hector dear to zeus commanded now
why falling back , my brave ones ?
but among them stood magnificent paris now , fair-haired helen 's lord , and he came back with a winging burst in answer : stop , antenor !
as he fell the enormous elephenor grabbed his feet , chalcodon 's son , lord of the brave-hearted abantes , dragged him out from under the spears , rushing madly to strip his gear but his rush was short-lived
but how to begin this current struggle here and see it through , victorious all the way ?
menelaus the famous spearman stabbed him right where he stood , the spearpoint pounding his collarbone to splinters
all , at least , the deadly spirits have not dragged away
it slipped his mind or he failed to care , but what a fatal error !
but thoas son of andraemon spurred them on , aetolia 's best by far , skilled with the spear , superb at cut-and-thrust and few achaeans could put him down in debate when the young men vie and struggle over points
consents to fight me again , defeated as he is ?
your oars should barely shave that rock to port !
now see what you have done !
from me alone , achilles of all achaeans , he seizes , he keeps the bride i love
then aged drances—always quick to attack the young captain , turnus—full of hatred and accusations , breaks forth to have his say : man of troy , great in fame , greater in battle , how can i sing your praises to the skies ?
headlong ruin 's massing against us quickly
as a lion springs on flocks unguarded , shepherd gone , pouncing on goats or sheep and claw-mad for the kill , so tydeus ' son went tearing into that thracian camp until he would butchered twelve
so all on his own diomedes charged the front , lurched to a halt before old nestor 's team and winged a flight of orders at the horseman : old soldier , these young fighters wear you down — your strength goes slack and old age dogs your steps , your driver 's worthless , your horses drag their weight
so the fates were spinning out the future
and the tuscan fighter , gazing up at the sky and drinking in the air as he returned to his senses , said : my mortal enemy , why do you ridicule me , threaten me with death ?
sick with mounting cares he assumes a look of hope and keeps his anguish buried in his heart
as you may have noticed , they camp around our walls on every side
here they come , full tilt , aeneas and hector , troy 's best men , bearing down on us here — this point of tears and attack !
but once he had stripped the corpse the proud runner achilles took his stand in the midst of all the argive troops and urged them on with a flight of winging orders : friends — lords of the argives , o my captains !
where am i racing now ?
weighing it all , heart and soul , as on they came , waves of trojan shieldsmen crowding him tighter , closing in on their own sure destruction
cisseus reared him at home when he was little — his mother 's father who sired the fine beauty theano — but once he hit the stride of his youth and ached for fame , cisseus tried to hold him back , gave him a daughter 's hand but warm from the bridal chamber marched the groom , fired up by word that achaea 's troops had landed
athena , eyes blazing , breathed fury in diomedes and he went whirling into the slaughter now , hacking left and right and hideous groans broke from the dying thracians slashed by the sword — the ground ran red with blood
bloody ares lunged at it now with giant lance and athena backed away , her powerful hand hefting a boulder off the plain , black , jagged , a ton weight that men in the old days planted there to mark off plowland — pallas hurled that boundary-stone at ares , struck his neck , loosed his limbs , and down he crashed and out over seven acres sprawled the enormous god and his mane dragged in the dust , his armor clashed around him
they dropped lots in a bronze helmet , shook it hard and the lot fell to teucer to shoot first
saturnian juno says i may not speak a word
but orestes burned with love for his stolen bride , spurred by the furies for his crimes , he seized pyrrhus , quite off guard , and butchered him at his father ’ s altar
suddenly , in the thick of it all , a young soldier , hands shackled behind his back , with much shouting trojan shepherds were haling him toward the king
and back he trips , poor man , stumbling , crashing head over shoulders into the altar rearing behind him there , and messapus , fired up now
work out your own defense , he says , you and your captains save the argive armies and the ships
up he leapt and raced from the halls , shouting : you , volusus , call your volscian units to arms , move your rutulians out
how deep were the groans you uttered , gazing now from the city heights to watch the broad beaches seething with action , the bay a chaos of outcries right before your eyes ?
they had come together from every quarter , belongings , spirits ready for me to lead them over the sea to whatever lands i ’ d choose
vaunting along the hulls with team and car but never destined to slip past the deadly spirits , never to ride in glory home to windswept troy
that far i may go with my words of warning
he makes his way to the private quarters of his guest , aeneas , the old veteran bearing in mind their recent talk and the help that he had promised
and amidst it all the heaving sea ran far and wide , its likeness forged in gold but the blue deep foamed in a sheen of white and rounding it out in a huge ring swam the dolphins , brilliant in silver , tails sweeping the crests to cut the waves in two
meanwhile marshal agamemnon led his commanders , a file of senior chiefs , toward his own lodge and set before them a feast to please their hearts
he had lived in pedaeon , before the argives came , and wed a bastard daughter of priam , medesicaste , but once the rolling ships of achaea swept ashore , home he came to troy where he shone among the trojans , living close to priam , who prized him like his sons
turnus , first to attack , whirled a flaming torch that stuck in the tower ’ s flanks and whipped by the wind it quickly seized on planking , clinging fast to the doorway ’ s posts it ate away
that , or else one of us might stand beside achilles and lend him winning force — his courage must not flag
how — stealing behind the trojans ' main lines or meeting up with a god who gave them to you ?
he sends the bravest captains to implore you , leaders picked from the whole achaean army , comrades-in-arms that you love most yourself
yes , chryses approached the achaeans ' fast ships to win his daughter back , bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand , wound on a golden staff , the wreaths of the god , the distant deadly archer
she towered into the sky on balanced wings , cleaving a giant rainbow , flying beneath the clouds
now lead the way , wherever your fighting spirit bids you
so the captain reported
aphrodite fell to her knees , over and over begged her dear brother to lend his golden-bridled team : oh dear brother , help me !
an island rises in mid-sea—crete , great jove ’ s own land where the first mount ida rears , the cradle of our people
and agamemnon the lord of men could not resist
as he tried to mount behind his team the famous spearman stabbed a heavy javelin deep in his right shoulder — he dropped from his war-car , gripped by the hateful dark
messapus , keen to disrupt the truce , whips his charger straight at tuscan aulestes , king adorned with his kingly emblems , forcing him back in terror
spare the body buried here—spare your own pure hands , don ’ t stain them !
achilles rushed with his spear at noble polydorus son of priam
up with you — no more lying low !
and once they arrived at paris ' sumptuous halls the attendants briskly turned to their own work as helen in all her radiance climbed the steps to the bedroom under the high , vaulting roof
and once they had entered the harbor deep in bays they furled and stowed the sail in the black ship , they lowered the mast by the forestays , smoothly , quickly let it down on the forked mast-crutch and rowed her into a mooring under oars
agamemnon himself , the lord of men had given them those well-benched ships to plow the wine-dark sea , since works of the sea meant nothing to those landsmen
there is a country— the greeks called it hesperia , land of the west , an ancient land , mighty in war and rich in soil
and moved now to his depths , the famous runner cried , no , no , my prince , patroclus , what are you saying ?
but now beware , or my curse will draw god 's wrath upon your head , that day when paris and lord apollo — for all your fighting heart — destroy you at the scaean gates !
so with my father , peleus
what spurs you to rouse the hells of war you ’ ve never known ?
if troy had borne two others to match aeneas , trojan troops would have marched on greece ’ s cities , greece would now be grieving , fate turned upside down
showers of spears raining from daring , hardy arms went deep into soldiers ' bodies quick to fight but showers of others , cut short halfway before they could graze glistening skin , stuck in the ground , still lusting to sink in flesh
not achilles — armored in battle-power down he flung on the trojans , loosed barbaric cries , and his first kill was iphition , otrynteus ' hardy son and a chief of large contingents , born of a river nymph to otrynteus , scourge of towns , below tmolus ' snows in the wealthy realm of hyde
at times , when the winter ’ s northwest winds blot out the stars , it ’ s all submerged , the breakers thunder it under
what , am i to believe my powers broken down at last , glutted with hatred , now i rest in peace ?
that very moment the son of cronus seized his storm-shield — rippling and flaring bright — and shrouding ida in dark clouds , loosed a bolt with a huge crack of thunder , shook the shield , gave the trojans triumph and routed fear-struck argives
halys next , he sends him packing along with comrades , phegeus too , as a spear impales him through his shield , then men on the ramparts keen for combat , blind to turnus who picks them off , alcander and halius , prytanis and noëmon
the helmed aeantes could no more frighten hector , the proud son of priam , back from patroclus ' corpse than shepherds out in the field can scare a tawny lion off his kill when the hunger drives the beast claw-mad
i , by god , i would drive our argives into battle now , starving , famished , and only then , when the sun goes down , lay on a handsome feast — once we have avenged our shame
it would be wrong , disgraceful to share that coward 's bed once more
the force of the blow still overwhelmed his senses
but zeus hates me now
just as , all too often , some huge crowd is seized by a vast uprising , the rabble runs amok , all slaves to passion , rocks , firebrands flying
then on he went for isus and antiphus , killed and stripped the two sons of priam , one a bastard , one royal blood and both riding a single car , the bastard driving , the famous antiphus standing poised beside him
death cut him short
it was all that matchless god , sleek-haired leto 's son — he killed him among the champions and handed hector glory
the skin of the coward changes color all the time , he ca not get a grip on himself , he ca not sit still , he squats and rocks , shifting his weight from foot to foot , his heart racing , pounding inside the fellow 's ribs , his teeth chattering — he dreads some grisly death
archery next — and again achilles set out iron , dark gray trophies , ten double-headed axes , ten with single heads
but where are they now ?
that is the blood i claim , my royal birth
no doubt you bragged that you could hold your city without an army and trojan allies — all on your own , just with your sister 's husbands and your brothers
perhaps — but he must be fast — he can bring the body safely back to his ship , stripped as patroclus is — hector with that flashing helmet has his armor
feast her eyes on her husband , parents , children too ?
she closed with a dive and drove the tall ship on with her right hand—how well she knew the ropes !
hold back our retreating mobs outside the gates before they throw themselves in their women 's arms in fear , a great joy to our enemies closing for the kill
here were the best picked men detached in squads to stand the trojan charge and shining hector : a wall of them bulked together , spear-by-spear , shield-by-shield , the rims overlapping , buckler-to-buckler , helm-to-helm , man-to-man massed tight and the horsehair crests on glittering helmet horns brushed as they tossed their heads , the battalions bulked so dense , shoulder-to-shoulder close , and the spears they shook in daring hands packed into jagged lines of battle — single-minded fighters facing straight ahead , achaeans primed for combat
no more standing round like bragging boys — someone will dress us down , and roughly too
and next he wings from afar a deadly spear at magus ducking under it , quick , as the quivering shaft flies past and magus , hugging aeneas ’ knees , implores : i beg you now by your father ’ s ghost , by your hopes for rising iulus , spare this life of mine for my father and my son !
and that , that 's why the heart inside me aches when i hear our trojans heap contempt on you , the men who bear such struggles all for you
but then some bully with both his parents living beats him from the banquet , fists and abuses flying : 'you , get out — you have got no father feasting with us here !
fifty sons i had when the sons of achaea came , nineteen born to me from a single mother 's womb and the rest by other women in the palace
have you a favorite mortal man there too ?
ah , but evander , you will never see him retreat , hit by a shameful wound , never pray for a father ’ s wretched death , disgraced by a son who still lives safely on
whoever will dare — what glory he can win — a night patrol by the ships to learn at once if the fleet 's still guarded as before or now , battered down at our hands , huddling together , they plan a quick escape , their morale too low to mount the watch tonight — bone-weary from battle
you too , you twins , went down on latian fields , thymber , larides , daucus ’ sons : identical twins , an endearing puzzlement to your parents till pallas made a strict distinction between you
italy waits you now , look , sail on and make it yours !
and he forged a thriving vineyard loaded with clusters , bunches of lustrous grapes in gold , ripening deep purple and climbing vines shot up on silver vine-poles
so turnus bursts through the fractured ranks , charging toward the walls where the earth runs red with blood and the winds hiss with spears and , hand flung up , he cries with a ringing voice : hold back now , you rutulians !
and aetolia 's elders begged meleager , sent high priests of the gods , pleading , 'come out now !
no slowing down , i tell you , we must strike at once !
and so , both harnessed up in the grim gear of war , the two men moved out , leaving behind them all the captains clustered on the spot
setting out from the harbor , leaving ships and shore i chanced to see andromache pouring out libations to the dead—the ritual foods , the gifts of grief— in a grove before the city , banked by a stream the exiles made believe was simois river
they tell me menoetius , actor 's son , is still alive , and peleus , aeacus ' son , lives on among his myrmidons — if both our fathers had died , we would have some cause for grief
and now the great runner remembered one more duty
but hector all afire , blazing head to foot , charged at their main force , bursting down as a wave bursts down on a veering ship , down from under the clouds it batters , bred by gale-winds — showers of foam overwhelm the hull , blot it all from sight , the hurricane 's killing blast thundering into the sails and scudding clear of death by the skin of their teeth the sailors quake , their hearts race on with terror — so the achaeans ' courage quaked
but hordes of men fought on , the achaean and trojan infantry going hand-to-hand
dead in his tracks he stopped , terrified , stammering , teeth chattering in his mouth , bled white with fear as the two men overtook him and panting hard , yanked and pinned his arms
and let us heap a single great barrow over the pyre , one great communal grave stretched out across the plain and fronting it throw up looming ramparts quickly , a landward wall for ships and troops themselves
the father of gods and king of men convenes a council high in his starry home , as throned aloft he gazes down on the earth , the trojan camp and latian ranks
these gates , evander says , as he reaches his lodge , hercules in his triumph stooped to enter here
they ’ ve plundered the hearthfires , sooty torches ignite a murky glare , and the god of fire hurls at the skies a swirl of sparks and ash
a mystery— but the trojans know the pains of a great love defiled , and the lengths a woman driven mad can go , and it leads their hearts down ways of grim foreboding
a sudden darkness had swept across the earth and hermes was all but on them when the herald looked up , saw him , shouted at once to priam , danger , my king — think fast !
when tall hector with that flashing helmet of his kept slaughtering argives pinned against our ships — how could i once forget that madness , that frenzy , the ruin that blinded me from that first day ?
now your father and noble mother will never close your eyes in death — screaming vultures will claw them out of you , wings beating your corpse !
doomed theseus sits on his seat and there he will sit forever
while latinus rules , you ’ ll never lack rich plowland , bounty great as troy ’ s
then the abyss , tartarus itself plunges headlong down through the darkness twice as far as our gaze goes up to olympus rising toward the skies
wasting time in libya—what hope misleads you so ?
there in the halls her father and mother always called cleopatra halcyon , after the seabird 's name
zeus planted a killing doom within us both , so even for generations still unborn we will live in song
aeolus warmed to juno ’ s offer : yours is the task , my queen , to explore your heart ’ s desires
no , my friend , i have no desire to fight the blithe immortals
the eagle of jove had just swooped down on them all from heaven ’ s heights and scattered them into open sky , but now you can see them flying trim in their long ranks , landing or looking down where their friends have landed— home , cavorting on ruffling wings and wheeling round the sky in convoy , trumpeting in their glory
i ’ m set on fighting aeneas hand-to-hand , set , however bitter it is , to meet my death
since now you have spared my life
— he 's destroyed my best son !
one and the same lot for the man who hangs back and the man who battles hard
while zeus on the heights sat poised to thunder orders
he was not your father , the horseman peleus — thetis was not your mother
and off to the left of battle she discovered ares , violent ares sitting there at ease , his long spear braced on a cloudbank , flanked by racing stallions
now , while the gods had still kept clear of mortal men , the achaeans kept on gaining glory — great achilles who held back from the brutal fighting so long had just come blazing forth
and turnus in matchless fury gears himself for war
no , odysseus , let him rack his brains with you and the other captains how to fight the raging fire off the ships
so tribe on tribe , pouring out of the ships and shelters , marched across the scamander plain and the earth shook , tremendous thunder from under trampling men and horses drawing into position down the scamander meadow flats breaking into flower — men by the thousands , numberless as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring
you will be marcellus
now go , our glory of troy , go forth and enjoy a better fate than mine
but here ’ s drances , feigning terror at my rebukes , a scoundrel ’ s shabby dodge , just to hone his charges hurled against me !
you took the final measure with a sword
then , from that point on he would thrust the trojans breakneck back from the fleet and give the argives glory
if without your assent , against your will the trojans have reached italy , let them pay for their latest outrage , never grant them rescue
let him bluster there and play the king in his court , let aeolus rule his bolted dungeon of the winds !
the dove settled onto the mast of the dark-prowed ship , her neck wrenched awry , her beating wings went slack and life breath flew from her limbs that instant — down she dropped , a long drop down to the ground
he sat up with a start and made his wishes known : atrides — chiefs of achaea 's united forces — first put out the fires with glistening wine , wherever the flames still burn in all their fury
kept alive by your death ?
achilles , filled with rage , addressed his own great heart : by heaven , an awesome miracle right before my eyes !
at last hector grappled a ship 's stern , a beauty built for speed — it swept the seas with protesilaus , bore him to troy but never bore him back to his fatherland again
he stopped the fight , pulled the battle-weary dares out of the bout and consoled him with these words : poor man , what insanity ’ s got you in its grip ?
and your sword-arm , cretheus , bravest greek afield— it could not snatch you from turnus , nor did the gods he worshipped save cupencus ’ life when aeneas came his way : he thrust his chest at the blade but his brazen shield , poor priest , could not put off his death
you too are made of mortal stuff , i would say
but captain aeneas , dazed by this swift sharp blow , kept wrestling the overriding anguish in his heart , now this way , that way
as for strength in war , zeus lends power to some , others he wastes away , whatever his pleasure — the strongest god of all
let alban kings hold sway for all time
wait , i will settle things myself
his temper can never bend and change — like some lion going his own barbaric way , giving in to his power , his brute force and wild pride , as down he swoops on the flocks of men to seize his savage feast
and plenty of argives too — kill them if you can
serranus , numa too , and a growing crowd cluster around the dead and dying men , and the ground lies warm with the recent massacre , rivulets foam with blood
nine days the arrows of god swept through the army
punishing work , you see , to fight the sons of invincible cronus ' son , even sprung from a river as you are !
with that , cebriones flogged their sleek team and leaping under the whistling , crackling whip they sped the careering car into both milling armies , trampling shields and corpses , axle under the chariot splashed with blood , blood on the handrails sweeping round the car , sprays of blood shooting up from the stallions ' hoofs and churning , whirling rims
now far beyond our reach , now by the argive ships the rushing dogs will tear you , bolt your flesh !
the monster ’ s father was vulcan , whose smoky flames he vomited from his maw as he hauled his lumbering hulk
a greater tide of events springs up before me now , i launch a greater labor
here your home is assured , yes , assured for your household gods
that—with priam put to the sword ?
the rest sprang to their feet , the sceptered kings obeyed the great field marshal
but you , i beg you , comfort her in her frailty , brace her in desolation
or still more gold you are wanting ?
and at once achilles called his myrmidons keen for battle : belt yourselves in bronze !
no , don ’ t press me to face such battles now
he twists over , vomiting hot blood from his chest , chill with death , his flanks racked with his last gasps
the dead of night
at that , opis dove down from the sky through a light breeze , her body wrapped in a whirlwind dark as night and whirring on her way
now aeneas , the good captain , enters , then the trojan soldiers , taking their seats on couches draped in purple
with that he left her there and made for his bellows , turning them on the fire , commanding , work — to work !
rescue caletor before the argives strip his gear — he 's down , he 's dead by the ships that crowd the beach !
his driver held them reined off at the side while he advanced through the front ranks on foot , plowing on and on till he lost his own life
hector , what help are you to him , now you are dead ?
invite him into your councils
the wind cries for canvas , the buoyant oarsmen crown their sterns with wreaths
he always carried it , layered with hide and ringed with gleaming bronze , fitted with double cross-stays — under it low he hunched and the brazen spear flew past with a grating screech as the shaft grazed the shield
his rustic bands escort him now from near and far , the men who live on praeneste ’ s heights , on the fields of gabine juno , men from the anio ’ s icy stream , the hernici ’ s dripping rocks , men you nourish , rich anagnia—bathed in your river , father amasenus
now she even stirs the dead , the one realm in the world still left untested , yes , and allecto , suddenly loosed on earth , tears like a maenad through the heart of italian cities
and gallant agenor drew the spear from his hand and bound it up in a band of tightly twisted wool , a sling his aide retained for the good commander
but agamemnon 's followers grouped together now and as they approached achilles the din and trampling of their feet awoke him
for mighty heracles came against us years before , he ground our lives out , killing off our best
aeneas marvels at its mass—once a cluster of huts— he marvels at gates and bustling hum and cobbled streets
forward , each on his own !
high on a gate he carved androgeos ’ death and then the people of athens , doomed—so cruel— to pay with the lives of seven sons
suddenly up she rose from the churning surf like mist and settling down beside him as he wept , stroked achilles gently , whispering his name , my child — why in tears ?
his head was full of obscenities , teeming with rant , all for no good reason , insubordinate , baiting the kings — anything to provoke some laughter from the troops
but never again , he will never rob me blind with his twisting words again !
he looks to me like machaon from behind , clearly , machaon head to foot , asclepius ' only son
my heart 's pounding , leaping up in my throat , the knees beneath me paralyzed — oh i know it
if only his father were here to watch it all in person !
quickly , drive our long-haired achaeans to battle now !
even king latinus is overwhelmed
so he decreed and the son of cronus bowed his craggy dark brows
all those burning desires olympian zeus has brought to pass for me — but what joy to me now ?
ancaeus of pleuron wrestled against me — down he went
with that she breathed in her son tremendous courage then instilled in patroclus ' nostrils fresh ambrosia , blood-red nectar too , to make his flesh stand firm
the other 's still afield , standing up to the trojans ' slashing onslaught
wasting no words , no time on empty questions , heaving a deep groan from his heart he calls out : escape , son of the goddess , tear yourself from the flames !
pelides groaned , scanning the arching blank sky : father zeus !
no delay in the face of signs like these
but here for the first time fortune veered in its course and turned against the trojans
down from his chariot turnus vaulted , nerved to attack the enemy face-to-face on foot
but what outrage has mutilated your face so clear and cloudless once ?
the cool tactician set the record straight : no , no , nestor — achaea 's greatest glory — any god , if he really set his mind to it , could give us an even finer pair than this
you pity the man ?
just as in dreams when the nightly spell of sleep falls heavy on our eyes and we seem entranced by longing to keep on racing on , no use , in the midst of one last burst of speed we sink down , consumed , our tongue won ’ t work , and tried and true , the power that filled our body fails—we strain but the voice and words won ’ t follow
out they march , young iulus flushed with joy
he will leave behind him wife and sons unscathed , his house and estate unharmed — once these argives sail for home , the fatherland they love
why this sudden radiance lighting the heavens ?
— how to slaughter hordes of achaeans pinned against their ships ?
achilles went for asteropaeus fresh from the ford , braced to face him there and brandishing two spears and the xanthus filled the trojan 's heart with courage , the river seething for all the youths achilles slaughtered , chopped to bits in its tide without a twinge of pity
denouncing me — my comrades , clustered together , always grumbling
at the sight an icy sweat goes rippling down my body , i tear myself from bed , i raise my hands and voice in prayer to the skies and tip a pure , unmixed libation on the hearth
too well i know the beat of your wings , the drumbeat of doom
while mother and son agreed among the clustered ships , trading between each other many winged words , father zeus sped iris down to sacred troy : quick on your way now , iris , shear the wind !
hard by his team and car she found the king , cooling the wound that pandarus ' arrow dealt him
they spread the gates and rammed the doorbars back and the spreading gates made way for a ray of hope as phoebus apollo hurtled forth to meet achilles , to fight disaster off the trojan troops
i have never noticed you on the lines where we win glory , not till now
so now you listen too
but if , in fact , we capture italy , seize the scepter in triumph , allot the plunder
but if , later , the gods allow us to plunder the great city of priam , you shall enter in when we share the spoils , load the holds of your ship with gold and bronze — as much as your heart desires — and choose for your pleasure twenty trojan women second only to argive helen in their glory
the old surgeon , his robe tucked back and cinched in the healer ’ s way , with his expert , healing hands and apollo ’ s potent herbs he works for all he ’ s worth
it ’ s dark there , gaps in their watchfires , smoke blackens the sky
you will meet your doom at once , beaten down by achilles , so much stronger than you — that hard , headlong man
she will reveal to you the italian tribes , the wars that you must fight , and the many ways to shun or shoulder each ordeal that you must meet
now take my son — or was he all a dream ?
and the crippled smith brought all his art to bear on a dancing circle , broad as the circle daedalus once laid out on cnossos ' spacious fields for ariadne the girl with lustrous hair
but once he ’ s embraced aeneas , clung to his neck to sate the deep love of his father , deluded father , cupid makes for the queen
on the other side an endless desert , parched earth where the wild barcan marauders range at will
in their command sailed forty curved black ships
so all through troy the men who had fled like panicked fawns were wiping off their sweat , drinking away their thirst , leaning along the city 's massive ramparts now while achaean troops , sloping shields to shoulders , closed against the walls
hector hurled at him — a sudden glint of the spear — but ajax saw it coming and dodged the bronze shaft , just by a hair , and the weapon caught schedius , gallant iphitus ' son and phocia 's finest man , who made his home in the famous town of panopeus , ruling tribes of men
clear commands but menoetes , fearing some hidden reefs , veers his prow to starboard , to open water , and gyas shouts again : where now ?
third in the vanguard marched euryalus strong as a god , son of king mecisteus son of talaus , but over them all , with cries to marshal men diomedes led the whole force and his argives sailed in eighty long black ships
lycia 's captains are bearing down too hard , fierce as they always were in past attacks
so on they marched , meriones and idomeneus commanders of armies strode to battle helmed in gleaming bronze , meriones first to ask , son of deucalion , where do you say we join the fighting now ?
ares drove them , fiery-eyed athena drove the argives , and terror and rout and relentless strife stormed too , sister of manslaughtering ares , ares ' comrade-in-arms — strife , only a slight thing when she first rears her head but her head soon hits the sky as she strides across the earth
but if one denies them , turns them away , stiff-necked and harsh — off they go to the son of cronus , zeus , and pray that ruin will strike the man down , crazed and blinded until he 's paid the price
there man killed man in the mad scatter of battle
your love for your father lures you into folly
but how could he shrink before the enemy , slip back into a crowd of cohorts now ?
trojans — the other side on the plain 's high ground — formed around tall hector , staunch polydamas , aeneas loved by the trojans like a god , and antenor 's sons , polybus , prince agenor and acamas still unwed , three men in their prime like gods who never die
down she flashed from the peaks of mount olympus , quickly reached the ships and found odysseus first , a mastermind like zeus , still standing fast
out went the bow-stones — cables fast astern — and the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf , leading out the sacrifice for the archer god apollo , and out of the deep-sea ship chryseis stepped too
the rest of them ?
three times he shouted out to aeneas , a great resounding shout , and aeneas knew that voice and his prayer rose up in joy : so grant it , father of gods and high apollo , bring the battle on !
the sharp stone crushed both brows , the skull caved in and both eyes burst from their sockets , dropping down in the dust before his feet as the reinsman vaulted , plunging off his well-wrought car like a diver — cebriones ' life breath left his bones behind and you taunted his corpse , patroclus o my rider : look what a springy man , a nimble , flashy tumbler !
he warms them in with treasures of the field , he cheers the exhausted men with generous care
but the soldiers saw them , rushed them , cut off at a stroke the herds of oxen and sleek sheep-flocks glistening silver-gray and killed the herdsmen too
come over here , antilochus , royal prince — this is the old custom
now in the homes , in king latinus ’ city that overflowed with wealth , the breaking wails and the long dirges reach their climax
hail forever , our great pallas !
come , you immortals , think this through
but look at them now , like green , defenseless boys or widowed women whimpering to each other , wailing to journey back
and down to the last unit all eased off their armor , fine burnished bronze , and released their neighing teams and took their seats by the swift runner achilles ' ship , myrmidons in their thousands , and he set before them all a handsome funeral feast to meet their hearts ' desire
that 's your halfway mark where the homestretch starts and there 's plenty of good smooth racing-room around it — it 's either the grave-mound of a man dead long ago or men who lived before us set it up as a goal
as frantic as pentheus seeing battalions of furies , twin suns ablaze and double cities of thebes before his eyes
here an incredible story meets our ears : that helenus , priam ’ s son , holds sway over these greek towns , that he had won the throne and wife of pyrrhus , son of achilles—andromache was wed once more to a man of trojan stock
euphemus led the cicones , fighters armed with spears , son of troezenus , ceas ' son , a warlord bred by the gods
but his sister , changed to look like his charioteer , metiscus , handling the car and team and reins , she faced him with this challenge : this way , turnus !
to spur a volunteer to spy on trojan lines ?
diomedes , true , and his city , arpi , will offer us no relief
that left the fifth unclaimed , the jar with double handles
we already know your power , far too well
you are all witness , look — my prize is snatched away !
it seemed an eternity
so keep your head , my boy , be on the lookout
here its lair , that house of labor , the endless blinding maze , but daedalus , pitying royal ariadne ’ s love so deep , unraveled his own baffling labyrinth ’ s winding paths , guiding theseus ’ groping steps with a trail of thread
then to the man whose prowess won him second place he gives a coat of mail , glinting with burnished links and triple-meshed in gold , a victor ’ s trophy he himself had dragged from demoleos , killed near simois ’ rapids under troy ’ s high wall
diomedes hurled a spear that struck agastrophus , paeon 's warrior son , and smashed the joint of his hip but his team was not close by for fast escape — a big mistake , the fool
but once his soul and the life force have left him , send death to carry him home , send soothing sleep , all the way till they reach the broad land of lycia
he brought him down with a glinting jagged rock , massive , top of the heap behind the rampart 's edge , no easy lift for a fighter even in prime strength , working with both hands , weak as men are now
i not only fear for our comrade 's body — patroclus will glut the dogs and birds of troy and all too soon — but i fear for my own head , for my own life
attack their shattered camp !
i have no mind to linger here disgraced , brimming your cup and piling up your plunder
not till i hurl the smoke-black halls of priam headlong — torch his gates to blazing rubble — rip the tunic of hector and slash his heroic chest to ribbons with my bronze — and a ruck of comrades round him , groveling facedown , gnaw their own earth !
there his warm , generous wife came running up to meet him , andromache the daughter of gallant-hearted eetion who had lived below mount placos rich with timber , in thebe below the peaks , and ruled cilicia 's people
not for certain , no , but the leader seems to me an aetolian man by birth — he 's king of the argives , horse-breaking tydeus ' son , rugged diomedes !
the radiant queen of sea-nymphs seized a veil , blue-black , no robe darker in all the ocean 's depths , and launched up and away with wind-swift iris leading — the ground swell round them cleaved and opened wide
permitted to enter port but never granted a city girded round by ramparts , not before some terrible hunger and your attack on us— outrageous slaughter—drive you to gnaw your platters with your teeth !
and dido herself , standing before the altar , holding the sacred grain in reverent hands— with one foot free of its sandal , robes unbound— sworn now to die , she calls on the gods to witness , calls on the stars who know her approaching fate
and then , for a fact , the rutulians , trojans , all the italians , those defending the high ramparts , those on attack who batter the walls ’ foundations with their rams : all armies strained to turn their glances round and lifted their battle-armor off their shoulders
from old troy we come—troy it ’ s called , perhaps you ’ ve heard the name—sailing over the world ’ s seas until , by chance , some whim of the winds , some tempest drove us onto libyan shores
i will offer it up to you — i will sheathe its horns in gold !
with the forces poised to clash you tell us to haul our oar-swept vessels out to sea ?
king latinus—if he won ’ t yield your bride and keep his word , then he must learn his lesson , taste , at last , the force of turnus ’ sword !
zeus commands you to arm your long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now you can take the broad streets of troy !
fire her on and cithaeron echoes round with maddened midnight cries
but now zeus gave our pylians stunning triumph !
come — we will send a detail of picked men
but i am off to a lookout point to learn the truth
strong diores the son of amarynceus led the third and the princely polyxinus led the fourth , the son of king agasthenes , augeas ' noble stock
ah but of course—the fates bar my way
so here menelaus paused with much to command meriones and the aeantes : ajax and ajax , captains of achaea , meriones too , remember patroclus now , our stricken comrade !
they did not waste a moment , closed at once — ares stabber of shields led off , charging athena , shaking his brazen spear and dressed the goddess down : you dog-fly , why drive the gods to battle once again with that stormy bluster driving your wild heart ?
those two alone , athena and hera , sat apart from zeus — not a word would they send his way , not a question
but he lunged first , wounding lordly deiopites , spearshaft slicing into the trojan 's shoulder , then cut down thoon and ennomus in their blood , chersidamas next , vaulting down from his car — odysseus caught him up under the bulging shield with a jabbing spear that split him crotch to navel — the man writhed in the dust , hands clutching the earth
ah if only it might prove well and good to all , to every immortal god , men might still live on in royal priam 's citadel
where are the team and car you always ride ?
not even ares , lasher of armies , not even athena watching the battle here could scorn its fury , not even in their most savage lust for combat , no — so tense the work of war for the men and chariot-teams that zeus stretched taut across patroclus this one day
but if they give me nothing i will take a prize myself — your own , or ajax ' or odysseus ' prize — i will commandeer her myself and let that man i go to visit choke with rage !
you would not find him asleep , not cringing a moment , hanging back from the struggle — he pressed for battle now where men win glory
his breastplate could not save him , the bronze he always wore , and the lance impaled his guts — he gasped , convulsed and out of his well-made car the trojan pitched — and as for his team , proud nestor 's son antilochus drove them out of the trojans into argive lines
your halls lie under ida , high halls at lyrnesus but here in laurentine soil lies your tomb
no more strolling about the halls with father raging
right to restore that mislaid sword to turnus— for without your power what could juturna do ? — and lend the defeated strength ?
here , as her first step , the priestess steadies four black-backed calves , she tips wine on their brows , then plucks some tufts from the crown between their horns and casts them over the altar fire , first offerings , crying out to hecate , mighty queen of heaven and hell
here are your deadly enemies , camping close at hand
but i can drag things out , delay the whole affair : that i can do , and destroy them root and branch , the people of either king
why not flee headlong ?
and he forged the ocean river 's mighty power girdling round the outmost rim of the welded indestructible shield
nothing can stop it now
now to the ships — now like a pride of man-eating lions the trojan forces stormed the fleet , fulfilling zeus 's strict commands as zeus kept building their fury higher , stunned the argives ' spirit and wrenched away their glory , lashing trojans on
— suffer for paris , protect paris , for eternity
coming before the lord of storm and lightning the two just stood there , waiting
but soon as i reach their hollow ships , torches — do not forget now , one of you bring me lethal fire !
the day has returned , if i am not mistaken , the day always harsh to my heart , i ’ ll always hold in honor
and in moved ajax now , planted right beside him , bearing that shield of his like a wall , a tower — trojans scattered in panic , bolting left and right while the fighting son of atreus led odysseus through the onslaught , bracing him with an arm till a reinsman drove his team and car up close
but hector held firm , staking all on his massive fighting strength — again and again he would hurl himself at the melee , again and again stand fast with piercing cries but he never gave ground backward , not one inch
you ’ ll be abandoned now to carrion birds or plunged in the deep sea and swept away by the waves and ravening fish will dart and lick your wounds !
but now , look , a whirlwind of fire goes rolling story to story , billowing up the sky , and clings fast to a mobile tower , a defense he built himself of wedged , rough-hewn beams , fitting the wheels below it , gangways reared above
as the kings come riding in , a massive four-horse chariot draws latinus forth , his glistening temples ringed by a dozen gilded rays , proof he owes his birth to the sun-god ’ s line , and a snow-white pair brings turnus ’ chariot on , two steel-tipped javelins balanced in his grip
the same joy they took in arms and chariots when alive , in currying horses sleek and putting them to pasture , follows them now they rest beneath the earth
to cling to your own prize while i sit calmly by — empty-handed here ?
all in the same day went down to the house of death , the great godlike runner achilles butchered them all , tending their shambling oxen , shining flocks
look , no fortress ardea hugging her native turnus !
evander himself and his new trojan allies , share and share alike , slaughter yearling sheep as the old rite demands
diores ' son automedon shouted back , alcimedon !
a great wail rises up from the deep curved bay as they linger out the night and day in each other ’ s arms
what good are prayers and shrines to a person mad with love ?
so thetis cried as she left the cave and her sisters swam up with her , all in a tide of tears , and billowing round them now the ground swell heaved open
there on the spot the man 's strength and life collapsed and blinding grief for his driver overpowered hector , stunned for his friend but he left him lying there , dead , and swept on , out for another hardy driver
but i am willing to give her back , even so , if that is best for all
the seer took heart and this time he spoke out , bravely : beware — he casts no blame for a vow we failed , a sacrifice
there in the midst , a giant shadowy elm tree spreads her ancient branching arms , home , they say , to swarms of false dreams , one clinging tight under each leaf
with that , she cut the lock with her hand and all at once the warmth slipped away , the life dissolved in the winds
and paris , magnificent as a god , replied , ah hector , you criticize me fairly , yes , nothing unfair , beyond what i deserve
it must have slipped your mind
all i bore was doom
what forces sail with aeneas fresh from the tuscan shores , manning their ships for battle , sweeping through the waves ?
and so , with head bent low , saturn ’ s daughter replied : because i have known your will so well , great jove , against my own i deserted turnus and the earth
true , but around his head a mournful shadow flutters black as night
our people will live in peace on the rich soil of troy
but when triumphant achilles stripped hector ’ s life , the gallant hero joined forces with dardan aeneas , followed a captain every bit as strong
quick with treachery noble hera answered , give me love , give me longing now , the powers you use to overwhelm all gods and mortal men !
all that i foresee has been decreed
hera cleansed her enticing body of any blemish , then she applied a deep olive rub , the breath-taking , redolent oil she kept beside her
our blood will put an end to this war at last— that ’ s the field where lavinia must be won !
patroclus planted a heel against his chest , wrenched the spear from his wound and the midriff came out with it — so he dragged out both the man 's life breath and the weapon 's point together
for that , if my crime against you is so wicked , rip me to bits and fling the bits in the sea , plunge me into the depths !
deep in your chest i have put your father 's strength
under his command came huge divisions from amiternum , the first quirites , all the ranks from eretum , mutusca green with olives , all who live in nomentum city , the rosean fields by lake velinus , all on tetrica ’ s shaggy spurs and grim-set mount severus , all in casperia , foruli , on the himella river ’ s banks , men who drink the tiber and fabaris , men dispatched from icy nursia , musters from orta , the latin tribes , men that the allia—ominous name—divides as it flows on
but once they reached the springs for the fourth time , then father zeus held out his sacred golden scales : in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low — one for achilles , one for hector breaker of horses — and gripping the beam mid-haft the father raised it high and down went hector 's day of doom , dragging him down to the strong house of death — and god apollo left him
what heroes sprang into bloom , what weapons blazed , even in those days long ago , in italy ’ s life-giving land ?
so , first you must bend your oar in sicilian seas and cross in your ships the salt italian waves , the lakes of the underworld and aeaea , circe ’ s isle , before you can build your city safe on solid ground
there are two great jars that stand on the floor of zeus 's halls and hold his gifts , our miseries one , the other blessings
and the girls wore robes of linen light and flowing , the boys wore finespun tunics rubbed with a gloss of oil , the girls were crowned with a bloom of fresh garlands , the boys swung golden daggers hung on silver belts
andromache , pressing close beside him and weeping freely now , clung to his hand , urged him , called him : reckless one , my hector — your own fiery courage will destroy you !
so fight by the ships , all together
we turned , looked back at him
and give your king this message : power over the sea and ruthless trident is mine , not his—it ’ s mine by lot , by destiny
it 's skill , not brawn , that makes the finest woodsman
that city , the cause of the war , the heart of latinus ’ realm— unless they bow to the yoke , brought low this very day , i ’ ll topple their smoking rooftops to the ground
lord agamemnon rose at once to greet them both with the great tactician odysseus by his side
so then and there under royal agamemnon 's hands the two sons of antenor filled out their fates and down they plunged to the strong house of death
hector 's speeding horses swept him away , armor and all , leaving his men to face their fate , trojans trapped but struggling on in the deep trench
he plows the sea in the bronze-sided tiger
— or the deathless gods will strike me down at last at the hands of argive fighters
if you honored me last time and heard my prayer and rained destruction down on all achaea 's ranks , now , once more , i beg you , bring my prayer to pass !
he turned to asclepius ' son with an urgent , winged word : think , noble machaon , what shall we do now ?
but where will it end ?
and you , my tyrians , harry with hatred all his line , his race to come : make that offering to my ashes , send it down below
a high stabbing cry — and out in the front ranks he drove his plunging stallions
no less bloody euryalus ’ work—the man ’ s on fire , storming down on the common ruck before him , fadus , herbesus , rhoetus , abaris , quite unconscious now
and now despite their courage the trojan fighters seeing the two sons of dares , one on the run , one dead beside his chariot — all their hearts were stunned
surely they can be healed , the hearts of the brave
so they charge , trojan aeneas and turnus , son of daunus , shields clang and the huge din makes the heavens ring
but nestor the old driver rose and spoke at once : few can match your power in battle , diomedes , and in council you excel all men your age
high astern he stands , the twin flames shoot forth from his lustrous brows and rising from the peak of his head , his father ’ s star
perhaps he will show us mercy
then — with a shrill wail they all stretched their arms to athena as theano , her face radiant , lifting the robe on high , spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess ' knees and prayed to the daughter of mighty father zeus : queen athena — shield of our city — glory of goddesses !
whomever i want i will make my cherished wife — at home
superb equipment — bending it back hard the archer strung his bow
no , my mind won ’ t change , won ’ t budge an inch
all at once , in the midst of her last words , her women see her doubled over the sword , the blood foaming over the blade , her hands splattered red
have no doubt , what you see is real
achilles rose up tall and challenged every achaean : now men come forward — compete to win this prize !
see that honor attend these good daughters of zeus , honor that sways the minds of others , even heroes
commands given , he called the gods to witness
first he covered his broad back with leopard skin , a fine spotted hide , then lifting a round helmet of good sturdy bronze , he fitted it to his head , he took a spear in his grip and off he strode to rouse his brother , king of all the argives , the armies that prized him in his power like a god
let them set out the number , the class of ship they need
now shatter the spear of diomedes !
so hector drew back to his thronging comrades , terrified to hear the voice of god
through the worst the world can offer
seize the car where the handsome armor lay and pull it out by the pole or prize it up , bodily , haul it off — or tear the life from still more thracian troops ?
but he blocked them all from hacking passage through to the fast trim ships as ajax all alone , battling on mid-field between achaean and trojan lines , would stand and fight
no one could match me there , none among the epeans , not even our own pylians , or aetolia 's hardy men
tight as the closing gap between the wheel and horse when he hauls his master 's car top speed across the flats , the very tip of his tail brushing the running-rim and the wheel spins closer , hardly a gap between as he sweeps the open plain — that much , no more , menelaus trailed antilochus , dauntless driver
she found her beloved son lying facedown , embracing patroclus ' body , sobbing , wailing , and round him crowded troops of mourning comrades
i will never leave you , i will set you safe at your father ’ s door
once in the trojan council he ordered menelaus , there on an embassy joined by king odysseus , murdered right on the spot — no safe-conduct back to the land of argos
then achilles nodded to priam , leading the king on with brusque advice : sleep outside , old friend , in case some achaean captain comes to visit
but now as enemy fighters harry messapus even more , he flings himself in the stream and , flushed with triumph , pries from the turf his spear and baby girl as one , his gift to you , diana , goddess of the crossroads
bright as that star amid the stars in the night sky , star of the evening , brightest star that rides the heavens , so fire flared from the sharp point of the spear achilles brandished high in his right hand , bent on hector 's death , scanning his splendid body — where to pierce it best ?
the first to make them out was the cretan captain
then , as a peace offering , let him present you a lavish feast in his tents so you wo not lack your just deserts at last
you have covered it all fairly , point by point
but if i leave my comrades panicked before his charge , this prince achilles — slip away from the wall on foot and race the other way , out to ilium 's plain and reach the spurs of ida , hide in the underbrush and then , in the dying light
here , in victory , i lay down my gloves , my skill
at once , i tell you , a stranger fear runs through the harrowed crowd
even so , we pity these argive spearmen living out their grim fates , dying in blood
aeneas in command , the handsomest of them all , advancing as her companion joins his troop with hers
rhoetus vomits his red lifeblood , spewing out gore and wine mixed with the man ’ s last gasp
you are fond of him , are you ?
up to the huge gate-tower of troy she 's gone because she heard our men are so hard-pressed , the achaean fighters coming on in so much force
past these they raced , one escaping , one in pursuit and the one who fled was great but the one pursuing greater , even greater — their pace mounting in speed since both men strove , not for a sacrificial beast or oxhide trophy , prizes runners fight for , no , they raced for the life of hector breaker of horses
they will all be hurled back to the black ships
striking a stand in the dueling-ground just cleared they brandished spears at each other , tense with fury
the king will hand you gifts to match his insults if only you will relent and end your anger
the soldier who gets in first and cuts a rival 's flesh , who pierces armor to draw blood and reach his entrails — i will give that man this broadsword , silver-studded , handsome thracian work i stripped from asteropaeus
now rumor is in her glory , filling africa ’ s ears with tale on tale of intrigue , bruiting her song of facts and falsehoods mingled
a long while they said nothing , spirits dashed
shake them out of your teeming heart , sunder their pact of peace , sow crops of murderous war !
and over the massing lines of men and massing chariots , high in the air aeneas vaulted , hurled by the god 's hand till he came to ground at the battle 's churning flank where cauconian units braced themselves for action
what people hold it ?
floating adrift toward the cyclops ’ coast
long as he kept his royal status , holding forth in the councils of the kings , i had some standing too , some pride of place
the latins are our enemies twice over—this is the second pact they ’ ve shattered !
euryalus countered : you ’ re spinning empty arguments , they won ’ t work
whoever misses the bird but still hits the cord — he 's the loser , true , but he takes the single heads
nor has it been my way , soldiering on beside you , following out the fate of great-hearted aeneas , right to the bitter end
and i took my stand among them , comrade-in-arms the day the amazons struck , a match for men in war
we are right behind you , fighting the trojans , fighting this prince hector
i tell you i never cringe at war and thundering horses !
why have they come ?
his beauty fine as a craftsman ’ s hand can add to ivory , or aglow as silver or parian marble ringed in glinting gold
no , at his royal ease , and powerful as he is , let him rest content with his third of the world
coming face-to-face with atrides agamemnon , he relieved him of his fathers ' royal scepter — its power can never die — and grasping it tightly off he strode to the ships of argives armed in bronze
all right then , citizens !
after the long cortege of pallas ’ friends had moved on well ahead , aeneas drew to a halt , groaned from his depths and spoke these last words : the same dark fate of battle commands me back to other tears
you are planting the seeds of endless trouble for us all !
her son who makes the starry world go round replied : mother , what are you asking fate to grant ?
not even semele , not even alcmena queen of thebes who bore me a son , that lionheart , that heracles , and semele bore dionysus , ecstasy , joy to mankind — not when i loved demeter , queen of the lustrous braids — not when i bedded leto ripe for glory — not even you !
put an end to your labors
lifting one from the lot , hecuba brought it out for great athena 's gift , the largest , loveliest , richly worked , and like a star it glistened , deep beneath the others
he stopped — overwhelmed by the torrid blast of the master craftsman god of fire — and xanthus cried to hera , pouring out his heart in a flood of supplication , oh hera — why ?
they thought you the bravest champion we could field , and just because of the handsome luster on your limbs , but you have no pith , no fighting strength inside you
zeus commands you to arm your long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now you can take the broad streets of troy !
famous names in the future , nameless places now
who are his parents ?
so that gray-eyed girl of mine may learn what it means to fight against her father
i only wanted to plunge myself in grief
but i would die of shame to face the men of troy and the trojan women trailing their long robes if i would shrink from battle now , a coward
but the big spear 's point still stuck in the eye socket — hoisting the head high like a poppy-head on the shaft he flourished it in the eyes of all the trojans now , yelling out his boast : go tell them from me , you trojans , tell the loving father and mother of lofty ilioneus to start the dirges in the halls !
neither his strength nor splendid build can save him , not now , i tell you — nor all that glorious armor : now , somewhere under our floods that gear will sink , immersed deep in slime , and i , i will roil his body round in sand and gravel , tons of spills of silt
no , it ’ s turnus alone he ’ s tracking , eyes alert through the murky haze of battle , turnus alone aeneas demands to fight
up with you — now , late as it is , if you want to pull our argives , our hard-hit armies , clear of the trojan onslaught
already i see them looming up beside you — death and the strong force of fate , to bring you down at the hands of aeacus ' great royal son
illustrious paris — crush him under my hand !
they went for each other fast , close range — phegeus hurled first , his spear 's shadow flew and over tydides ' left shoulder the tip passed and never touched his body
but abruptly zeus was set on infuriating hera , courting her fire with cunning , mocking taunts : so , those two goddesses there are menelaus ' best defense , hera of argos , boeotian athena , guard of armies
a terrific din of bronze rang from the captain 's chest , striding toward attack
quick to his cry poseidon and pallas moved in close , stood at his shoulder now and taking human form , grasped him hand-to-hand , spoke bracing words , poseidon who shakes the mainland first to say , courage , achilles !
what ’ s more , if a prophet has second sight , if helenus earns your trust and apollo fills his soul with truth , one prophecy , one above all , son of the goddess , i will make to you , over and over repeat this warning word
and once they reached the perfect spot for attack , a watering place where all the herds collected , there they crouched , wrapped in glowing bronze
chiefs of the argives armed in bronze , the favorite son of peteos dear to immortals needs you at his strongpoint — hurry , come , just for a moment , meet the crisis there
he went on the run at the fighting prophet helenus , all menace , madly shaking his whetted javelin just as helenus seized his bow by the handgrip
race through wounds to a swift and noble death ?
as smoke goes towering up the sky from out a town cut off on a distant island under siege
look there , he heads for niphaeus ’ car and his four horses raising their chests against him , but as they see him ramping on in his loping strides and hear him groan in fury , round they wheel in terror , rearing backward , spilling their driver out the chariot , whirling it down to shore
but in twelve days the father returns to olympus
now , when the famous crippled smith had finished off that grand array of armor , lifting it in his arms he laid it all at the feet of achilles ' mother thetis — and down she flashed like a hawk from snowy mount olympus bearing the brilliant gear , the god of fire 's gift
aeneas is the first to attack the beleaguered farmers and— sign of the battle ’ s outcome—brings the latins down , killing mighty theron who dared to attack aeneas
but about the dead , i would never grudge their burning
meanwhile anchises gave the command to spread sail , no time to waste , we ’ d lose the good fair winds , and apollo ’ s seer addressed him with deep respect : anchises , worthy to wed the proudest , venus herself , how the gods do love you
killing so many brave achaeans for no good reason , not a shred of decency , just to wound my heart !
over against the ships he dropped to a knee , let fly a shaft and a terrifying clash rang out from the great silver bow
but just then a troop of cavalry sent on ahead from the latin city— the rest of the army waits , poised on the plain— comes riding in with messages for king turnus
but you , if your heart compels you , climb this ridge and i soon will set your steps on an easy path
quick with another arrow , the archer let fly from his bowstring straight for hector , his spirit straining to hit him — shot and missed again as apollo skewed his shaft — but he leveled archeptolemus , hector 's daring driver charging headlong , caught him square in the chest beside the nipple and off his car he pitched as his horses balked , rearing , pawing the air
hector knew full well the tide of battle had turned but still stood firm , defending die-hard comrades
i will not venture into achilles ' presence : it would offend us all for a mortal man to host an immortal face-to-face
hector who burned so many oxen in my honor , rich cuts , now on the rugged crests of ida , now on ilium 's heights
what is fortune saving you for , what death-blow ?
this fine beast , straying from home , chanced to be floating down a stream , cooling off on a grassy bank when the frenzied hounds of the hunter iulus started it—iulus himself , fired with a love of glory , aimed a shaft from his tensed bow and allecto steadied his trembling hand and the arrow shot with a whirring rush and pierced through womb and loins
the whole lot — we drove them all into pylos then , that very night , corraling them all inside the walls of neleus
atreus ' son agamemnon , for all his far-flung kingdoms — the man disgraces me , seizes and keeps my prize , he tears her away himself !
then in my panic something strange , some enemy power robbed me of my senses
magnificent racing stallions , gifts of the gods to peleus , shining immortal gifts , straining breakneck on as patroclus ' high courage urged him against prince hector , keen for the kill but hector 's veering horses swept him clear
but helenus son of priam , best of the seers who scan the flight of birds , came striding up to aeneas and hector , calling out , my captains !
search for your ancient mother
he gave me worthy ransom and you shall have your share from me , as always , your fitting , lordly share
he hears hoofbeats , hears a commotion , orders , hot pursuit
hera placed in her hand a burnished golden cup and said some words of comfort , and taking a few quick sips , thetis gave it back
but his noble mother , settling down at his side , stroked achilles gently , whispering his name : my child — how long will you eat your heart out here in tears and torment ?
artemis taught the man herself to track and kill wild beasts , whatever breeds in the mountain woods , but the huntress showering arrows could not save him now nor the archer 's long shots , his forte in days gone by
desert — if your spirit drives you to sail home , then sail away , my king !
there lies sarpedon , lord of lycia 's shieldsmen , who defended his realm with just decrees and power — ares has cut him down with patroclus ' brazen spear
then , riddled with wound on wound , he threw himself on his lifeless friend and there in the still of death found peace at last
no better tactics now than to fight them hand-to-hand with all our fury
these are the realms that monstrous cerberus rocks with howls braying out of his three throats , his enormous bulk squatting low in the cave that faced them there
i will find my own death , sword in hand : my enemies keen for spoils will be so kind
he had kept a watch for the trojans , posted atop old aesyetes ' tomb and poised to sprint for home at the first sign of argives charging from the ships
reaching the front , they climbed down from the chariot , onto the earth that feeds us all , and into the space between achaean and trojan lines they marched
brooding , never forgetting the gods would bring no son of mine to birth , not from my own loins
and strife and havoc plunged in the fight , and violent death — now seizing a man alive with fresh wounds , now one unhurt , now hauling a dead man through the slaughter by the heels , the cloak on her back stained red with human blood
how unless one last time , one final time apollo had swept in close beside him , driving strength in his legs and knees to race the wind ?
with that greeting she leads aeneas into the royal halls , announcing offerings in the gods ’ high temples as she goes
you are the one hit hardest by the fighting , hector , you more than all — and all for me , whore that i am , and this blind mad paris
her husband noticed , and filled with pity now , hector stroked her gently , trying to reassure her , repeating her name : andromache , dear one , why so desperate ?
hephaestus gave it to cronus ' son , father zeus , and zeus gave it to hermes , the giant-killing guide and hermes gave it to pelops , that fine charioteer , pelops gave it to atreus , marshal of fighting men , who died and passed it on to thyestes rich in flocks and he in turn bestowed it on agamemnon , to bear on high as he ruled his many islands and lorded mainland argos
and the brilliant runner achilles saw him coming , filled with pity and spoke out winging words : why in tears , patroclus ?
your own fame goes spreading far as the light of dawn
and that 's why your spirit brought you back to troy , to climb the heights and stretch your arms to zeus
not even then will your noble mother lay you on your deathbed , mourn the son she bore
he collapsed , and his servants bore him quickly into the house
now you ’ ll pay me in full with your hot blood for both my men !
ca not you grasp what the white-armed goddess tells us ?
noble nestor the king of pylos ' sandy harbor spoke and urged them on with all good will : friends , lords of the argives , o my captains !
but all the same he hurled thymbraeus down to ground from his car — diomedes speared his left breast as odysseus killed the warlord 's aide-in-arms molion tall as a god and left them there for dead , their fighting finished
inspired with nestor 's voice and sent by zeus , the dream cried out , still asleep , agamemnon ?
what new twist of fortune can save me now ?
driven by all this , dido plans her escape , collects her followers fired by savage hate of the tyrant or bitter fear
but now take up in your hands my storm-cloud shield , its dark tassels flying , shake it over the argives , stampede their heroes in panic , archer of the sky
and the same women , the same men who once believed the face of the sea , its mighty god , too cruel to bear , now long to embark and brave the pains of exile to the end
— and the gods drove home that curse , mighty zeus of the underworld and grim persephone
then aeneas carried out twin robes , stiff with purple and gold braid , that dido of sidon made with her own hands once , just for aeneas , loving every stitch of the work and weaving into the weft a glinting mesh of gold
you who pity our hardships—wherever the ground lies where you come surging forth in all your glory—always with offerings , always with gifts i ’ ll do you honor , you great horned king of the rivers of the west
grief for his dead companion seized patroclus now , he tore through frontline fighters swift as a hawk diving to scatter crows and fear-struck starlings — straight at the lycians , patroclus o my rider , straight at the pressing trojan ranks you swooped , enraged at your comrade 's death !
only the first guards at the gates put up some show of resistance , fighting blindly on
ruthless mars was drawing the battle out , dead even now , equaling out the grief , the mutual slaughter
so there he stood , taking it all , beating away the ruthless day of death
and hector hurled at idomeneus now aboard a chariot — missed by a hair but he caught meriones ' aide and driver coeranus , one who would come with his lord from rock-built lyctus
fear would have gripped the staunchest man and made his knees give way
but aphrodite here with her everlasting laughter always stands by paris and drives the deadly spirits from her man
we attacked that tower with iron crowbars , just where the upper-story planks showed loosening joints—we rocked it , wrenched it free of its deep moorings and all at once we heaved it toppling down with a crash , trailing its wake of ruin to grind the massed greeks assaulting left and right
when pallas judged him just in range of his spear he moved up first—if only fortune would speed his daring , pitting himself against unequal odds , and he cries out to the arching heavens : hercules , by my father ’ s board , the welcome you met as a stranger , i beg you , stand by the great task i ’ m tackling now
next diomedes killed two sons of dardan priam careening on in a single car , echemmon and chromius
he ran to straddle and hide him with his shield as a brace of comrades shouldered up the fighter : echius ' son mecisteus helping good alastor bore him back to the hollow warships , groaning hard
then off she went herself to summon helen and found her there on the steep , jutting tower with a troop of trojan women clustered round her
so athena commanded and he obeyed , rejoicing at heart — achilles stopped , leaning against his ashen spearshaft barbed in bronze
now you will pay at a stroke for all my comrades ' grief , all you killed in the fury of your spear !
obey the commands of others , your superiors — you , you deserter , rank coward , you count for nothing , neither in war nor council
so off he went to lycia , safe in the escort of the gods , and once he reached the broad highlands cut by the rushing xanthus , the king of lycia gave him a royal welcome
and now , too , the dank night is sweeping down from the sky and the setting stars incline our heads to sleep
both warriors planted there before the towering gates rose like oaks that rear their crests on a mountain ridge , standing up to the gales and driving rains , day in , day out , their giant roots branching , gripping deep in the earth : so these two , trusting all to their arms , their power , stood up to asius ' headlong charge and never shrank
cronus ' son has trapped me in madness , blinding ruin — zeus is a harsh , cruel god
the old soldier spurring his men with skills from a lifetime spent campaigning , battles long ago
well , do as you please
if only i would foreseen all this , i and my cunning — that day eurystheus sent him down to death , to the lord who guards the gates , to drag up from the dark world the hound of grisly death — he would never have fled the steep cascading styx
sweet sleep overwhelmed him
the prophet spurs them at once to risk escape by sea : you can not root out troy with your greek spears unless you seek new omens in greece and bring the god back here— the image they ’ d borne across the sea in their curved ships
and zeus the son of cronus with cronus ' twisting ways , filling with pity now to see the two great fighters , said to hera , his sister and his wife , my cruel fate
with that he turned and left , filled with shame to grapple his own father 's brother hand-to-hand
shaking his spear , he hurled and its long shadow flew and the shaft hit paris ' round shield , hit full center — straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked , tearing the war-shirt , close by paris ' flank it jabbed but the trojan swerved aside and dodged black death
already , there , the grand house of deiphobus stormed by fire , crashing in ruins— already his neighbor ucalegon up in flames— the sigean straits shimmering back the blaze , the shouting of fighters soars , the clashing blare of trumpets
into the crowds he goes and as the bier is lowered , throws himself on pallas , clinging for dear life , sobbing , groaning , his sorrow all but choking his voice that thrusts a passage through at last : a far cry from the pledge you made your father , pallas , that you would do nothing rash the day you trusted yourself to the savage god of war !
but before they got the chance a great work of the war-god flashed before their eyes !
later i will bleed to death inside your walls
ready — whips raised high — at the signal all together lashed their horses ' backs and shouted , urging them on — they broke in a burst of speed , in no time swept the plain , leaving the ships behind and lifting under their chests the dust clung to the teams like clouds or swirling gales as their manes went streaming back in the gusty tearing wind
so follow my advice , hard as it may seem
as she saw me coming , flanked by trojan troops , she lost control , afraid of a wonder so extreme
they all sprang to their feet at sight of hera , lifting cups to greet her , crowding round the queen
and back he shrank to his cohorts , dodging death but hounding him as he went meriones speared him between the genitals and the navel — hideous wound , the worst the god of battles deals to wretched men
still some concern for troy 's and achaea 's armies ?
for my own death , i will meet it freely — whenever zeus and the other deathless gods would like to bring it on !
so he will say and the fresh grief will swell your heart once more , widowed , robbed of the one man strong enough to fight off your day of slavery
for a moment i ’ ll take on your work myself
he would shown his son the ropes , the last word in the master horseman 's skills
but there stood hector , shackled fast by his deadly fate , holding his ground , exposed in front of troy and the scaean gates
hector shouted out to his men in a piercing voice , gallant-hearted trojans and far-famed allies !
such bargaining in battle , turnus already cut it short when he cut pallas down !
you should be begging the men who lead your allies ' famous ranks to stand and fight for all they are worth — you will ward off all the blame they hurl against you
you are not so young yourself , and the man who attends you here is far too old to drive off an attacker spoiling for a fight
and then , if we can journey home to achaean argos , pride of the breasting earth , he will be my son-by-marriage !
even if he can swallow down his wrath today , still he will nurse the burning in his chest until , sooner or later , he sends it bursting forth
that ignites them , stiffens their spines and closing ranks they halt
the same agony , same sword , the one same hour had borne us off together
fighting words — that began to stir the rage inside aeneas ' chest and out for blood he charged idomeneus now
so now , whoever can find a better plan , let him speak up , young soldier or old
jove denies you the fields of dicte : crete
if agamemnon were not holding out such gifts , with talk of more to come , that son of atreus , if the warlord kept on blustering in his anger , why , i would be the last to tell you , 'cast your rage to the winds !
potitius first , the founder of the rites , the pinarian house too , that guards the worship of hercules
reaching the place where they would killed hector 's spy , odysseus dear to zeus reined in the headlong team and leaping down to the ground tydides heaved the bloody spoils into his comrade 's arms
next comes atys , soon the source of the latin atians , little atys , a boy the boy prince iulus loved
you ’ d think no other battles could match its fury , nowhere else in the city were people dying so
these are not the shores apollo of delos urged
how i fear for our comrades , fear the worst !
and how you used to boast , year in , year out , that you were the better man than fighting menelaus in power , arm and spear !
lords of the argives , all my captains !
for three whole days we rush , the waves driving us wildly on , the sun blotted out , for as many nights we ’ re robbed of stars to steer by
down from ida 's slopes he dove to the bloody field and lifting prince sarpedon clear of the weapons , bore him far from the fighting , off and away , and bathed him well in a river 's running tides and anointed him with deathless oils
the great telamonian ajax answered firmly , all true , straight to the point , lord menelaus
what painful news — would to god it had never happened !
summoning them together there atrides set forth his cunning , foolproof plan : hear me , friends — a dream sent by the gods has come to me in sleep
hail forever and farewell !
what you see is a punic kingdom , people of tyre and agenor ’ s town , but the border ’ s held by libyans hard to break in war
she quickly reached the sturdy house of hector , man-killing hector , and found her women gathered there inside and stirred them all to a high pitch of mourning
he called at once to his friend-in-arms patroclus , shouting down from the decks
suddenly seizing ruin by her glossy oiled braids — he was furious , raging — now he swore his inviolate oath that never again would she return to olympus ' starry skies , that maddening goddess , ruin , ruin who blinds us all
do not just stand there , useless with your weapons
you ’ ll pay , you shameless , ruthless— and i will hear of it , yes , the report will reach me even among the deepest shades of death !
but round my own black ship and camp this hector blazing for battle will be stopped , i trust — stopped dead in his tracks !
no , he waited achilles , coming on , gigantic in power
here the priest , when he brings the sacred gifts and looks for sleep beneath the silent night— stretched out on the hides of slaughtered sheep— will see whole hosts of phantoms , miracles on the wing , hear the voices swarm , engage with the gods in words and speak with acheron in avernus ’ deepest pools
never again will you see him among the argives
you , you insolent brazen bitch — you really dare to shake that monstrous spear in father 's face ?
they both go down to death , the fighter who shirks , the one who works to exhaustion
they cringe and cower like hounds circling a lion
orsilochus fearing to face the horseman remulus , whirls a lance at his horse instead , planting the point below its ear and furious , wild with the wound , it can not bear the agony , rearing back , chest high , its hoofs thrashing the air as remulus , thrown free , rolls around in the dust
you argives , you degraded — splendid in battle dress , pure sham !
the god of war is impartial : he hands out death to the man who hands out death
the goddesses themselves sat down on golden settles , mixing with the immortals , athena and hera 's hearts within them dashed
they burst into the bedroom , ulysses , that rouser of outrage right beside them , aeolus ’ crafty heir
the italian troops march forth , pouring out of the packed gates in tight , massed ranks and fronting them , the entire trojan and tuscan force comes rushing up , decked out in a range of arms , no less equipped with iron than if the brutal war-god called them forth to battle
for us and our children down the years an irresistible sorrow
and breaking out of their ranks deiphobus strode , the son of priam fired for feats of arms , there , thrusting his balanced round buckler before him , step by springy step on the balls of his feet , pressing forward under his shield
and so they fought and the iron din went rising up to the bronze sky through the barren breathless air
and the father heard and thundered on the left from a cloudless sky—the instant the lethal bow sings out and the taut shaft flies through remulus ’ head with a vicious hiss and rends his empty temples with its steel
ca not you see how they are clawing over dolops ' armor ?
i sent no fleet to troy , i never uprooted the ashes of his father , anchises , never stirred his shade
at that , his comrades cleared off from the field and as they withdrew , young pallas , struck dumb by that arrogant command , runs his eyes over turnus ’ enormous frame , scanning every feature from where he stood and glancing grimly , pallas volleys back these words to counter the words his high and mighty enemy used : now ’ s my time to win some glory , either for stripping off a wealth of spoils or dying a noble death— my father can stand up under either fate
why , if only half of us went to war , each soldier could hardly find a foe
but a man 's life breath can not come back again — no raiders in force , no trading brings it back , once it slips through a man 's clenched teeth
where would they lead ?
but once the best of the trojan captains fell , and many achaeans died as well while some survived , and priam 's high walls were stormed in the tenth year and the argives set sail for the native land they loved — then , at last , poseidon and lord apollo launched their plan to smash the rampart , flinging into it all the rivers ' fury
come , why don ’ t we labor now to live in peace ?
now captain aeneas , now tarchon erected pyres along the sweeping shore
even father himself , he ’ s filling the greek hearts with courage , stamina—jove in person spurring the gods to fight the trojan armies !
there diomedes aimed and stabbed , he gouged him down his glistening flesh and wrenched the spear back out and the brazen god of war let loose a shriek , roaring , thundering loud as nine , ten thousand combat soldiers shriek with ares ' fury when massive armies clash
for not even i will voyage home again
and dolon son of the herald blurted out , yes , yes , i will tell you everything , down to the last detail !
so in a blaze of fury he pummels dares headlong over the whole wide ring , lefts and rights , doubling blows , no lull , no letup , thick and fast as the hailstones pelting down from a stormcloud , rattling roofs , so dense the champion ’ s blows , both fists pounding over and over , battering dares reeling round— enough
looming over the cavern ’ s ridge a spur reared up , all jagged flint , its steep sides sheering away , a beetling , towering sight , a favorite haunt of nestling vultures
and others bear the spear and helmet of pallas
nothing could shake him now
some other god — who knows ?
sending such a traveler here to meet me — what a lucky omen !
and hector— three times achilles has hauled him round the walls of troy and now he ’ s selling his lifeless body off for gold
give up the fight ?
when pallas saw his arcadians , untrained to attack on foot and turning tail before the latins ’ pursuit— the lay of the rock-choked land convinced them all to desert their horses—so , seizing on one last way to stem disaster , now with prayers , now stinging taunts , he fires up their war-lust : where are you flying , friends ?
let there be one commander , one master only , endowed by the son of crooked-minded cronus with kingly scepter and royal rights of custom : whatever one man needs to lead his people well
he feared that , overwhelmed by the sight of hector , wild with grief , priam might let his anger flare and achilles might fly into fresh rage himself , cut the old man down and break the laws of zeus
meges saw him drop , he lunged at polydamas , fast , but he ducked and veered away and meges missed him — apollo was not about to let him fall at the front , not panthous ' son
we battle on in words , as always , mere words , and what 's the cure ?
and zeus spotted her now , zeus who gathers the breasting clouds
a flash , a sudden hurl and atrides speared a champion out in front — it was prince aeneas ' comrade-in-arms deicoon , pergasus ' son the trojans prized like priam 's sons , quick as he always was to join the forward ranks
so i plan to forestall her with ruses of my own and besiege the queen with flames , and no goddess will change her mood—she ’ s mine , my ally-in-arms in my great love for aeneas
when two work side-by-side , one or the other spots the opening first if a kill 's at hand
yes , soon they will kill you off , all the achaean forces massed for assault , and then , bereft of you , better for me to sink beneath the earth
a corpse without a name
all the lords who command the ships of battle , each and every one will give him a black ewe suckling a young lamb — no prize of honor like it
but ceaseless war 's upon us !
but the same anxiety keeps on churning in his heart as he scans the endless woods and prays by chance : if only that golden bough would gleam before us now on a tree in this dark grove !
and so , deep in peace , the father slept on gargaron peak , conquered by sleep and strong assaults of love , his wife locked in his arms
just as horrible , huge as polyphemus here in his rocky cavern , penning his woolly sheep , milking their udders dry , there are a hundred more accursed cyclops , everywhere , crowding the deep inlets , lumbering over the ridged hills
better for him by far
how could i leave aeneas prey to the lying winds ?
and now , sealing his pledge by the river styx , his brother ’ s stream , by the banks that churn with pitch-black rapids , whirlpools swirling dark , he nodded his assent and his nod made all of mount olympus quake
i will take him on with a will
the son of atreus , that skilled breaker of horses ?
so our two lines are branches sprung from the same blood
and on and on they row , wearying night and day as they round the long , winding bends , floating under the mottled shade of many trees and cleave the quiet stream reflecting leafy woods
the shore ’ s deserted now , the water ’ s hidden under the fleet—they bend to it , churn the spray and sweep the clear blue sea
come now , let us move off and settle down together far from the trampled field , take a lookout post and leave the war to mortals
what good is all our strife ?
he rode them off the ships , he quenched the leaping fire , leaving protesilaus ' hulk half-burnt but upright still and the trojans scattered back with high , shrill cries
then schedius and epistrophus led the men of phocis — two sons of iphitus , that great heart , naubolus ' son — the men who held cyparissus and pytho 's high crags , the hallowed earth of crisa , daulis and panopeus , men who dwelled round anemoria , round hyampolis , men who lived along the cephisus ' glinting waters , men who held lilaea close to the river 's wellsprings
and the first one she roused was atreus ' son powerful menelaus — he stood right at hand — she took the build and tireless voice of phoenix : yours is the shame , atrides
trading words , as dawn in her rose-red chariot crossed in mid-career , high noon in the arching sky , and they might have spent what time they had with tales if the sibyl next to aeneas had not warned him tersely : night comes on , aeneas
then one , romulus , reveling in the tawny pelt of a wolf that nursed him , will inherit the line and build the walls of mars and after his own name , call his people romans
look — one of the gods comes up beside me , tells me zeus the supreme commander still impels us all in battle
ilium , gone—our awesome trojan glory
out of the front he sprang , glaring left and right and hurled his spear — a glinting brazen streak — and the trojans scattered , cringing before his shaft
so he launched athena already poised for action — down the goddess swept from olympus ' craggy peaks
never again will you embrace him striding home
lavinia is your bride
but all the rest i possess beside my fast black ship — not one bit of it can you seize against my will , atrides
copreus , yes , that worthless father who sired a better son , better at every skill , primed for speed and war and his wits outstripped the best in all mycenae , but all of it went now to build prince hector 's glory
she breaks off in the midst of outbursts , desperate , flinging herself from the light of day , sweeping out of his sight , leaving him numb with doubt , with much to fear and much he means to say
then on he rushed at the sons of bias — laogonus , dardanus — hurled them off their chariot , slammed them both to ground , one with a spear-thrust , one chopped down with a blade
apollo heard and willed that part of the prayer would win the day but part he scattered abroad on the ruffling winds
my destiny , harrying me with trials hard as yours , led me as well , at last , to anchor in this land
if only the earth gaped deep enough to take me down , to plunge this goddess into the depths of hell !
the herald obeyed at once
come now , just wait till these long-haired achaeans sail back in their ships to the fatherland they love , then batter their wall , sweep it into the salt breakers and pile over the endless beach your drifts of sand again , level it to your heart 's content — the argives ' mighty wall
here , you ’ ll have a gift from old anchises himself
i am off to engage the man , though his fists are fire , though his fists are fire and his fury burnished iron !
and the fourth to yoke his full-maned team was antilochus , the splendid son of nestor the old high-hearted king , lord neleus ' offspring
all this binds me to you , and fate drives me here , and glad i am to follow
and home idaeus came , delivered his message standing in their midst and they fell to making hurried preparations , dividing the labors quickly — two detachments , one to gather the bodies , one the timber
with this potion , aged iapyx laved the wound , quite unaware , and suddenly all the pain dissolved from aeneas ’ body , all the blood that pooled in his wound stanched , and the shaft , with no force required , slipped out in the healer ’ s hand and the old strength came back , fresh as it was at first
again the trojan troops and teams overtook the body with hector son of priam storming fierce as fire
where can we turn for help from all our toil ?
you would think him a sullen fellow or just plain fool
what i urge is this : draw back to the city now
should he draw the long sharp sword slung at his hip , thrust through the ranks and kill agamemnon now ?
— right in the bull's-hide boss but the spear did not ram through , far from it , the long shaft snapped at the spearhead 's socket — the trojan had thrust his shield at arm 's length , shrinking before the expert marksman 's lance
but old phoenix passes the night in camp as achilles bids him , so he can voyage home , home in the ships with him to the fatherland they love
the rite performed , aeneas hurries to carry out the sibyl ’ s orders
home he went , i would say , but not on his own two feet , and brought no cheer to his loyal , loving wife and devoted parents
the fates have forbidden helenus to know the rest
with a firm resolve and willing hearts we ’ ve reached your city , driven out of our own kingdom , once the grandest realm the wheeling sun could see from olympus ’ heights
but the troopers fan out left and right , blocking the well-known paths , the sentries ringing all ways out
the oars shatter , prow twists round , taking the breakers broadside on and over aeneas ’ decks a mountain of water towers , massive , steep
still alive , still breathing the breath of life ?
the seeds of life— fiery is their force , divine their birth , but they are weighed down by the bodies ’ ills or dulled by earthly limbs and flesh that ’ s born for death
later , at leisure , strip the corpses up and down the plain !
atlas : his pine-covered crown is forever girded round with black clouds , battered by wind and rain ; driving blizzards cloak his shoulders with snow , torrents course down from the old titan ’ s chin and shaggy beard that bristles stiff with ice
he is deaf to all appeals
lost as he is , she ’ s lost as well , she hears him , sees him or she holds ascanius back and dandles him on her lap , bewitched by the boy ’ s resemblance to his father , trying to cheat the love she dare not tell
you tell me to put my trust in that , that monster ?
the old king starts in : greatest chief of the trojans—for while you are alive i ’ ll never consider troy and its kingdom conquered— our power to reinforce you in war is slight , though i know our name is great
antilochus killed his charioteer and steady henchman mydon , atymnius ' strapping son , just wheeling his racers round as antilochus winged a rock and smashed his elbow — out of his grip the reins white with ivory flew and slipped to the ground and tangled in the dust
no love between our peoples , ever , no pacts of peace !
look , a son of zeus come here to face you down
there i will house your oracles , mystic revelations made to our race , and ordain your chosen priests , my gracious lady
i am a god too
what blows he 's dealt our men !
as soon as she would sworn and sealed her binding oath , away they launched from imbros ' walls and lemnos , swathed in a thick mist and nimbly made their way until they reached mount ida with all her springs , the mother of wild beasts , and making lectos headland , left the sea for the first time and swept over dry land as the treetops swayed and shook beneath their feet
let him lead off
see to your own chores , go tend the shrines and statues of the gods
but i broke free of death , i tell you , burst my shackles , yes , and hid all night in the reeds of a marshy lake , waiting for them to sail—if only they would sail !
the trojans have my gear
one prayer the father granted , the other he denied : patroclus would drive the onslaught off the ships — that much zeus granted , true , but denied him safe and sound return from battle
and at one glance the lust came swirling over him , making his heart race , fast as the first time — all unknown to their parents — they rolled in bed , they locked and surged in love
then atreus ' son menelaus , the red-haired captain born of the gods , leading under the yoke his racers , blaze , agamemnon 's mare , and his own stallion brightfoot
bulked against them , boeotian troops , ionian troops with their long war-shirts , locrians , phthians and men of epea famed in battle fought to stop this hector hurtling at the ships
nor do i think you merit any other burial rites than good aeneas grants , and the trojan heroes , tuscan chiefs as well and tuscan armies , bearing your great trophies stripped from the men your right arm killed in war
and brilliant achilles tested himself in all his gear , achilles spun on his heels to see if it fitted tightly , see if his shining limbs ran free within it , yes , and it felt like buoyant wings lifting the great captain
but quick as a flash the soldier , certain his guile had won the day , runs away himself , yanking his reins around and digging iron spurs in his racing stallion ’ s flanks
on these shores arcadians sprung from pallas— king evander ’ s comrades marching under his banner— picked their site and placed a city on these hills , pallanteum , named for their famous forebear , pallas
good aeneas grants the appeal he ’ d never shun
not all of them march to war with armor , shields and chariots rumbling on
and the father of gods himself already marks him out with his own bolts of honor
and spotting tydides there , field marshal agamemnon gave him a winging burst of scorn : what 's this ?
only our native trojans hold their posts — many as those with hearth fires back in troy — our men have no choice , shouting out to each other , 'stay awake !
pallas wrenches the spearhead warm from his wound—no use— his blood and his life breath follow hard on the same track out
my mind 's made up
the old man was stunned , in a swirl of terror , the hairs stood bristling all over his gnarled body — he stood there , staring dumbly
achates is first to strike a spark from flint , then works to keep it alive in dry leaves , cups it around with kindling , feeds it chips and briskly fans the tinder into flame
but the old majestic priam countered quickly , who are you , my fine friend ?
now , would one of you gods call thetis to my presence ?
sthenelus sprang from the car , hit the ground and standing beside him , pulled the tearing arrow clean on through the wound and blood came shooting out like a red lance through the supple mesh shirt
then kings reared up and the savage giant thybris , and since his time we italians call our river tiber
then we are sent to elysium ’ s broad expanse , a few of us even hold these fields of joy till the long days , a cycle of time seen through , cleanse our hard , inveterate stains and leave us clear ethereal sense , the eternal breath of fire purged and pure
not all of a single tribe but three in one , four clans under each , and mantua leads them all and the city draws her force from tuscan blood
so all troy breathes free , relieved of her endless sorrow
far better for one of ours to reap the benefits than all the marauding argives
then , crowning all , juturna adds a greater power
go , patroclus , prince , bring out the girl and hand her to them so they can take her back
the lord of the earthquake yielded ground in answer : true , iris , immortal friend , how right you are — it 's a fine thing when a messenger knows what 's proper
and you will die with the rest
they would rather drop and die by our fast trim ships than rise to their defense
aeneas , never pausing , hails the ghost at once in an old familiar voice : mighty captain , deiphobus , sprung of the noble blood of teucer , who was bent on making you pay a price so harsh ?
around the pyre they planted a ring of stone revetments , piled the loose earth high in a mound above the ring and once they would heaped the barrow turned to leave
to my sisters ' house ?
as the eagle that bears jove ’ s lightning snatches up in his hooking talons a hare or snow-white swan and towers into the sky , or the wolf of mars that rips a lamb from the pens and its mother desperate to find it fills the air with bleating
and so he convenes a council , all the leading captains mustered at his command , inside the lofty gates
ah , so the deathless gods must love aeneas too
as fresh as i was that day the epeans buried lord amarynceus in buprasion and his sons held games to celebrate the king
begin , muse , when the two first broke and clashed , agamemnon lord of men and brilliant achilles
that roused the crowd , they leaned to look and marveled
and many drove their bronze blades through his body
must i bear the sight of latinus ’ houses razed— the last thing i needed—and not rebut the ugly slander of drances with my sword ?
seven summers gone since troy went down and still we ’ re swept along , measuring out each land , each sea— how many hostile rocks and stars ? —scanning an endless ocean , chasing an italy fading still as the waves roll us on
but what can he do ?
once we entered , allowed to appeal before the king , we offered our gifts , told him our names , our native land , and who had attacked us , what had drawn us to arpi
even of sorrow men can have their fill
so up now , hector — command your drivers here in all their hundreds to lash their plunging teams at the hollow ships
our sons-in-law will arrive from foreign shores : that is the fate in store for latium , so the prophets say , a stranger ’ s blood will raise our name to the stars
i am eager to do it — whatever i can do
but the rest will part in peace , and soon , soon
messapus himself was stunned with terror , his stallions reared , and the river , roaring , checked its currents , tiber summoned his outflow back from open sea
and menelaus found him alongside his ship 's stern , strapping his handsome gear around his shoulders
but finding he lacks the power to quash their blind fanatic will , and the world rolls on at a nod from brutal juno , time and again he calls the gods and empty winds to witness : crushed by fate , the father cries , we ’ re wrenched away by the tempest !
how can you sleep all night , a man weighed down with duties ?
what cowardice saps your courage ?
menelaus shoved adrestus back with a fist , powerful agamemnon stabbed him in the flank and back on his side the fighter went , faceup
i suppose you got such tender loving care at home from the trojans
well let him bed her now — enjoy her to the hilt !
but just when the woodsman makes his morning meal , deep in a mountain forest , arm-weary from chopping the big heavy trunks and his heart has had enough and sudden longing for tempting food overtakes the man and makes his senses whirl — just at the height of morning the argives smashed battalions , their courage breaking through and they shouted ranks of cohorts on along the lines
priam found the warrior there inside
what of the trophies hanging from your rafters ?
but not even then were his men without a captain , yearn as they did for their lost leader
now let no fighter be turned back to the ships , not with his captain 's orders ringing in his ears — keep pressing forward , shouting each other on !
all night long they hurled the flames — massed on the pyre , blast on screaming blast — and all night long the swift achilles , lifting a two-handled cup , dipped wine from a golden bowl and poured it down on the ground and drenched the earth , calling out to the ghost of stricken , gaunt patroclus
for the runner-up he produced a massive ox with rippling folds of fat and half a bar of gold for him who came in last
and the same in warfare : how he razed to the roots those brilliant cities , troy and oechalia both
now , when they mingled with our trojans in assembly , standing side-by-side , menelaus ' shoulders mounted over his friend 's in height and spread , when both were seated odysseus looked more lordly
book six : hector returns to troy
so they prayed as ajax harnessed himself in burnished , gleaming bronze and once he had strapped his legs and chest in armor , out he marched like the giant god of battle wading into the wars of men when zeus drives them hard to clash and soldier on with heart-devouring hate
shall i cut and run ?
what terrific sheen — silver afire like sunbeams !
cast delay to the winds !
he could not escape — no retreat , no dodging the stroke , like a pillar or tree crowned with leaves , rearing , standing there stock-still as the hero idomeneus stabbed him square in the chest and split the bronze plate that cased his ribs , gear that had always kept destruction off his flesh but it cracked and rang out now , ripped by the spear
the troops sat down by rank , each beside his horses pawing the ground where blazoned war-gear lay
— when he comes home from battle bearing the bloody gear of the mortal enemy he has killed in war — a joy to his mother 's heart
i was the one , i admit , who spurred her on to help her embattled brother , true , and blessed whatever greater daring it took to save his life , but never to shower arrows , never tense the bow
the god bent his head that the armies must be saved , not die in blood
your comrades , you yourself must hold fast to this sacred rite , this custom
now as the two men drank their parching thirst away and had just begun to please themselves with talk , confiding back and forth — there stood patroclus tall at the threshold , vivid as a god
the trojans , soon as they saw menoetius ' gallant son , himself and his loyal driver flare in brazen gear — all their courage quaked , their columns buckled , thinking swift achilles had tossed to the winds his hard rage that held him back by the ships and chosen friendship toward the argives now
but not for long , i trust — they will soon break off and slink back to olympus , home to the gathered gods who wait their coming , overwhelmed by the crushing power of our fists !
so she complied and turned their racers back
tonight conserve our strength in the meeting place , and the great walls and gates and timbered doors we hung , well-planed , massive and bolted tight , will shield the city
marvelous — like the man to the life !
his own mother had breathed her beauty on her son , a gloss on his flowing hair , and the ruddy glow of youth , and radiant joy shone in his eyes
may the gods make all our bluster come to nothing
i need all your immortal force
quickly he overtook his brother , noble hector still lingering , slow to turn from the spot where he had just confided in his wife
he bent down over it , trying to wrench the iron loose and track with a spear the kill he could not catch on foot
with that he hurled and athena drove the shaft and it split the archer 's nose between the eyes — it cracked his glistening teeth , the tough bronze cut off his tongue at the roots , smashed his jaw and the point came ripping out beneath his chin
all in vain my father peleus vowed to you that there , once i had journeyed home to my own dear fatherland , i would cut this lock for you and offer splendid victims , dedicate fifty young ungelded rams to your springs , there at the spot where your grove and smoking altar stand !
so all the trojans and famous friends-in-arms embraced polydamas ' plan , the faultless chieftain
there the spear stuck
so the bronze flared on his chest as out he rushed but his rough-and-ready aide-in-arms meriones intercepted him just outside the tent
amid this din and confusion gyas darts ahead , leading the field at the start to race across the surf— next cloanthus , better oared but his pine hulk slows him down— next , at an equal gap , the dragon and centaur fight it out for third , and now the dragon has it and now the huge centaur edges her out , now they ’ re even , prow to prow , cleaving the salt sea with long keels
better for me alone to redeem the pact for you and let my sword decide !
but resolute diomedes gave him a dark glance : sit down , my friend , be quiet
but any soldier wild with desire to reach his home at once — just let him lay a hand on his black benched ship and right in front of the rest he will reach his death !
spotting him first odysseus quickly pointed him out to diomedes : look , here 's our man , here are his horses
he first bore minos , watch and ward of crete , then minos bore an illustrious son deucalion , yes , and deucalion fathered me to command a race of men through the length and breadth of crete , and now our ships have borne me here to your shores to be your curse , a curse to your father , curse to the men of troy !
but much-enduring odysseus cut him short : not too long on the praise — do not fault me either
but now for total war , bearing down on the other gods , disastrous , massive , their fighting-fury blasting loose from opposing camps — the powers collided !
and guneus out of cyphus led on two and twenty ships and in his platoons came enienes and battle-tried peraebians who pitched homes in the teeth of dodona 's bitter winters , who held the tilled acres along the lovely titaressus that runs her pure crystal currents into peneus — never mixed with peneus ' eddies glistening silt but gliding over the surface smooth as olive oil , branching , breaking away from the river styx , the dark and terrible oath-stream of the gods
next he fought the solymi , tribesmen bent on glory , roughest battle of men he ever entered , so he claimed
polypoetes was not alone , leonteus shared the helm , companion of ares , caeneus ' grandson , proud coronus ' son
no pity for me , her mother ?
i will tell you , my son , not keep you in suspense , anchises says , and unfolds all things in order , one by one
what god urged you , all unknowing , to our shores ?
i will carry you on my back
here the infernal fury throws an instant frenzy into the hounds , she daubs their nostrils wet with a well-known scent , and they burn to chase a stag
for all that you have done for me , achilles , may the immortals fill your cup with joy !
turnus ’ limbs went limp in the chill of death
why such wailing echoing in the air ?
leave our olympian stronghold — take a message to greathearted priam down in troy : he must go to achaea 's ships and ransom his dear son , bearing gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
ours is a stately mansion , deep inside lie buried bars of ridged silver and heavy weights of gold , some of it tooled , some untooled—mine alone !
achilles has lost all pity !
incensed at the king he swept a fatal plague through the army — men were dying and all because agamemnon spurned apollo 's priest
only a glimpse of him the fates will grant the world , not let him linger longer
his voice rang out in tears and the warlords mourned in answer , each remembering those he had left behind at home
but rhoetus , waking , witnessed it all and cowered , crouching behind an enormous mixing-bowl , but euryalus pounced as rhoetus rose—he rushed him , drove a sword in his heart , up to the hilt then wrenched it back , dripping death
he seized the yoke as the luckless brother , slipping off the war-car , flinging his helpless arms toward aeneas , prayed : i beg you , beg by the ones who bore a son like you , great man of troy , now spare my life , pity my prayers !
father latinus , they say , had found it once himself , building his first stronghold , hallowed it to phoebus and named his settlers after the laurel ’ s name , laurentes
but the buoyant shade parades before the front , shaking a spear in his enemy ’ s face and taunting— turnus attacks it , rifling a vibrant lance , a long cast but the phantom swerves away and turnus in turmoil , thinking aeneas had really turned tail and fled , and drinking deep of the vapid cup of hope , cries out : where are you racing , aeneas ?
rocky ground and he 's quick at every treachery under the sun — the man of twists and turns
and rising up before her , the nile immersed in mourning opens every fold of his mighty body , all his rippling robes , inviting into his deep blue lap and secret eddies all his conquered people
if only we could seize his body , mutilate him , shame him , tear his gear from his back and any comrade of his who tries to shield his corpse — bring that enemy down with ruthless bronze !
then report the news to all his comrades
but hector ranged the front to find his leaders , hunting deiphobus and the rugged warlord helenus , adamas , asius ' son , and asius son of hyrtacus
back to the ships he will go , once he 's lashed the power out of his rippling stallions , whipping them back and forth beneath our city walls
so ajax swung now , leaping from deck to deck on the fast trim ships , ranging with huge strides as his voice hit the skies , keeping up a terrific bellowing , calling argives on to defend the ships and shelters
this was priam ’ s regalia when , in the way he liked to rule , he handed down the laws to his gathered people—the scepter , the holy coronet and the robes that trojan women used to weave
idomeneus had left the ships on foot that morning and would have offered the trojans a fine triumph now if coeranus had not rushed to the rescue , lashed his team and come like light to the king — he saved his life that day but he quickly lost his own to man-killing hector — hector speared him under the jaw and ear , knocking teeth out , shattering roots and all and split his tongue in half
yet the spirit inside you never shrinks from claiming to be his equal , never — though other gods will cringe from him in terror
do not talk to me of pacts
has the love your father hoped for mastered the hardship of the journey ?
what ’ s this conflict flouting my command ?
water for their hands !
grieving once for her own fate her mother had raised the halcyon 's thin , painful cry , wailing that lord apollo the distant deadly archer had whisked her far from idas
the mesh of the huge dragnet sweeping up the world , before you are trapped , your enemies ' prey and plunder — soon they will raze your sturdy citadel to the roots !
i never flinch at death or bow to a single god
one more thing — take it to heart , i urge you — you too , you wo not live long yourself , i swear
then with his blade he carved wide open liger ’ s chest , his hidden cache of life
there are the thracians , look , just arrived , exposed on the flank , apart from all the rest and right in their midst eioneus ' son , king rhesus
what then , did she stop in her tracks or lose her way ?
here ’ s pharus , watch , hurling his hollow threats as aeneas hurls his javelin , stakes it square in the man ’ s howling mouth
shield me , i implore you , from their fury !
sons i have , and they are hardy , handsome boys , and comrades too , men aplenty — one of the lot could light out now and summon up the kings
and the ships pulled in from lemnos bringing wine , a big convoy sent across by euneus , jason 's son whom hypsipyle bore the seasoned lord of armies
peace—we all beg you , turnus—bound with the one inviolate pledge of peace !
now the war-team — alcimus and automedon worked to yoke them quickly
as long as that man kept raging at royal agamemnon the argive troops were easier game to battle down
it ’ s just the style for tyrian girls to sport a quiver and high-laced hunting boots in crimson
now acron , a greek , had just arrived from corythus ’ old frontier , an exile , leaving his marriage in the lurch
there you have my lineage
here too , latinus himself , seeking out responses , slaughtered a hundred yearling sheep in the old way and there he lay ensconced , at rest on fleecy hides when a sudden voice broke from the grove ’ s depths : never seek to marry your daughter to a latin , put no trust , my son , in a marriage ready-made
but the leading trojan chiefs , the chosen men of rank were holding a council now on grave affairs of state— what should they do ?
how keen their longing for dry land underfoot as the trojans disembark , taking hold of the earth , their last best hope , and fling their brine-wracked bodies on the sand
but catch menelaus ' pair — fast — do not get left behind — or blaze will shower the two of you with disgrace — blaze is a mare !
how can a man be first in all events ?
how can you hold back your combat-fury any longer ?
well , you must get on with your friend 's burial now — the games must go on — but i accept this gladly , my old heart rejoices
finally diomedes lord of the war cry broke forth : great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon — if only you would never begged the dauntless son of peleus , holding out to achilles trove on trove of gifts !
with a full-shoulder stroke he flogged his horses on , loosing a splitting war cry down the trojan ranks and all cried back in answer — a savage roar rising — driving teams and chariots close in line with his
just as he vaulted off his ship a dardan killed him , first by far of the argives slaughtered on the beaches
the raiders quit the camp and race for safety
he suddenly sprang forward , into the front ranks , the god 's voice rippling strong : again , you argives ?
oh , dear god , was it i who caused your death ?
what am i hearing , why this enormous grief that rocks the walls , this clamor echoing from the city far away ?
but then , chancing to make the ocean ring with his hollow shell , the madman challenged the gods to match him blast for blast and jealous triton—if we can believe the story— snatched him up and drowned the man in the surf that seethed between the rocks
he shut himself in its depths , shattered the chains and down the great rock dropped , suspended by steel and his father ’ s skill , to wedge between the doorposts , block the entrance fast
teucer charged forward , mad to strip that gear but as teucer charged , hector flung his lance — a glint of bronze — but the argive saw it coming , dodged to the side and it missed him by an inch and hit amphimachus , cteatus ' son and actor 's heir , the shaft slashed his chest as he ran toward the front and down he went , thundering , armor clanging round him
welcome words , and the radiant goddess charis led the way inside
— he may have put an end to that fatal headstrong pride that always seized my hector — never hanging back with the main force of men , always charging ahead , giving ground to no man in his fury !
so come , let us yield to each other now on this one point , i to you and you to me , and the other deathless powers will fall in line
they tell how cycnus , wrung by grief for his lover , lifting a song to soothe his broken heart for phaëthon— shadowed by leafy poplars , phaëthon ’ s sisters once— cycnus donned the downy white plumage of old age , left the earth behind and soared up to the stars on wings of song
and he forged on the shield a herd of longhorn cattle , working the bulls in beaten gold and tin , lowing loud and rumbling out of the farmyard dung to pasture along a rippling stream , along the swaying reeds
so come , follow the gods ’ commands that lead us on
and aeolus , you too , the laurentine fields saw you go down and your body spread across the earth
now they will disgrace you , a woman after all
but with you the blessed gods are not enraged , not through and through , agamemnon
iris swooping down from the clouds ?
so he declared and sat down
like devouring fire roaring down onto dry dead timber , squalls hurling it on , careening left and right and brush ripped up by the roots goes tumbling under crushed by the blasting fire rampaging on — so under atrides ' onslaught trojans dropped in flight , stampedes of massive stallions dragged their empty chariots clattering down the passageways of battle , stallions yearning to feel their masters ' hands at the reins but there they lay , sprawled across the field , craved far more by the vultures than by wives
and throughout the halls of zeus the gods of heaven quaked with fear
but this , now , is the twentieth year for me since i sailed here and forsook my own native land , yet never once did i hear from you a taunt , an insult
but aeneas is driven by duty now
to fill your own cup of pain then slink back to olympus , whipped and fuming — forced ?
but if i kill him and apollo grants me glory , i will strip his gear and haul it back to sacred troy and hang it high on the deadly archer 's temple walls
so he appealed , calling out for the god ’ s help , and not for nothing
once he left evander and entered the tuscan camp , he seeks king tarchon , tells him his name and stock and the help he needs and the help he brings himself
if i ever served you well among the deathless gods with a word or action , bring this prayer to pass : honor my son achilles !
—achates was first to shout the name— italy !
here this firebrand , rabid hector leads the charge , claiming to be the son of high and mighty zeus
you , sun , whose fires scan all works of the earth , and you , juno , the witness , midwife to my agonies— hecate greeted by nightly shrieks at city crossroads— and you , you avenging furies and gods of dying dido !
then achilles carried into the armies ' broad ring a spear trailing its long shadow , laid it down and beside it placed a battle-shield and helmet , the arms patroclus stripped from lord sarpedon
antilochus next — the son of nestor drove in second , beating atrides not by speed but cunning — but still menelaus kept his racers close behind
i am setting an ambush deep in a hollowed woody path and posting troops to block the passage through at both ends of the gorge
i beg you , cool your fury against achilles
on with it — taste the bite of each other 's brazen spears !
wildly , back and forth , turnus gallops along the walls—a way in ? —no way in
invincible mars rears up to meet us face-to-face with waves of greeks assaulting the roofs , we see them choking the gateway , under a tortoise-shell of shields , and the scaling ladders cling to the steep ramparts— just at the gates the raiders scramble up the rungs , shields on their left arms thrust out for defense , their right hands clutching the gables
nevertheless , king agamemnon , groaning heavily , grasped menelaus ' hand and spoke out for the men as friends around him groaned as well : dear brother — that truce i sealed in blood was death for you , setting you out alone
are they the only men alive who love their wives , those sons of atreus ?
so god went up against god
when a man 's exhausted , wine will build his strength — battle-weary as you are , fighting for your people
then pallas athena granted tydeus ' son diomedes strength and daring — so the fighter would shine forth and tower over the argives and win himself great glory
but the old seer who knew the cause full well revealed the will of the archer god apollo
so do not anger me now
he has six sons — i am the seventh — we all shook lots and it fell to me to join the armies here at troy
so he prayed , and far in the depths they heard him , all the nereids , phorcus ’ chorus , virgin panopea and father portunus himself , with his own mighty hand , drove the racing scylla swifter than southern winds or a winging arrow , speeding toward the shore to find her berth in the good deep-water harbor
just let me offer a consolation prize to a luckless man , a friend without a fault
and men who held nisyrus , casus and crapathus , cos , eurypylus ' town , and the islands called calydnae — combat troops , and antiphus and phidippus led them on , the two sons of the warlord thessalus , heracles ' son
iris , racing the wind , brushed close and whispered , come , dear girl , come quickly — so you can see what wondrous things they are doing , stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze !
even the pilot palinurus , high astern at his station , cries out : why such cloudbanks wrapped around the sky ?
one thing she never told him — his own mother — what a terrible thing had taken place : his dearest friend-in-arms on earth lay dead
victory comes from zeus but not for you
but now i will go for the others , anyone i can catch
where ’ s that god of ours , that eryx , tell me— our teacher once , renowned for nothing now ?
next in the prizes comes the one who slit the cord and last the man whose shaft had drilled the mast
under him sail battalions , a thousand men who put astern the walls of clusium , cosae too ; their weapons , arrows , shouldering lightweight quivers , bows bristling death
a new day was just about to dawn , scattering light on the mountaintops , the horses of the sun just rearing up from the ocean ’ s depths , breathing forth the light from their flaring nostrils when the latins and trojans were pacing off the dueling-ground below the great city ’ s walls , spacing the braziers out between both armies , mounding the grassy altars high to the gods they shared in common
when hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man 's land along his lines he strode , gripping his spear mid-haft , staving men to a standstill
but now pelides shaking his long-shadowed spear was charging asteropaeus , mad to cut him down — pelegon 's son , himself a son of the axius river broad and fast and acessamenus ' eldest daughter , periboea , loved by the deep-swirling stream
his father reared him once in the grove of mars where symaethus ’ waters swirl and a shrine to the gods of sicily stands , the palaci , quick to forgive , their altar rich with gifts— and he sent his son to war
but the one who takes his fill of food and wine before he grapples enemies full force , dawn to dusk — the heart in his chest keeps pounding fresh with courage , nor do his legs give out till all break off from battle
she wrenched her will to his
i look , i ca not find one
but hector marked him at once , rushed up to his side and staked a spear in his chest to kill the fighter right in the eyes of loyal comrades standing by
now , when zeus who arrays the clouds saw hector from afar , strapping on the gear of peleus ' godlike son , he shook his head and addressed his own deep heart : poor soldier
should he forget his fate and settle in sicily now , or head for italian shores ?
the salt gray sunless ocean gave you birth and the towering blank rocks — your temper 's so relentless
he begs you to come at once , boreas , blustering zephyr , he promises splendid victims — come with a strong blast and light the pyre where patroclus lies in state and all the argive armies mourn around him !
pyrrhus will soon be here , bathed in priam ’ s blood , pyrrhus who butchers sons in their fathers ’ faces , slaughters fathers at the altar
but ajax fired the troops on his side too : shame , you argives !
look — have some respect for this !
and now in the no man 's land two champions , greatest of all , strode and closed , both men burning for battle , aeneas son of anchises and brilliant achilles
these weapons , take them , pluck from the quiver an arrow fletched for vengeance !
and so with me , i tell you !
i will never behold the high and mighty pride of their palaces , the myrmidons , the dolopians , or go as a slave to some greek matron , no , not i , daughter of dardanus that i am , the wife of venus ’ son
hold on , full force — spur all our men to battle !
i hail from paeonia 's rich soil , a far cry from here , heading paeonian troops with their long spears , and this my eleventh day since raising troy
north we sail and skirt ceraunia ’ s cliffs to the narrow straits , the shortest route to italy , while the sun sinks and darkness shrouds the hills
if they promise you my reward—the fame of the work ’ s enough for me—i think i can just make out a path , under that hill , to pallanteum ’ s city walls
proetus ' wife , you see , was mad for bellerophon , the lovely antea lusted to couple with him , all in secret
i ’ ll explain in a word or so
and you , i say , the day draws near when off you run and pray to father zeus and the other deathless gods to make your full-maned horses swifter than hawks — whipping dust from the plain to sweep you back to troy !
shore up our shattered fortunes
come , listen to me — my plan is so much better : let us halt the war and the heat of combat now , at least for today
i will never rise in their defense , not against you — i would never grudge your pleasure
so i approach the prophet-king with questions : son of troy and seer of the gods , you know the will of phoebus apollo , know his clarian tripods and his laurel , know the stars , the cries of birds , the omens quick on the wing
but if they are still alive in the enemy 's camp , then we will ransom them back with bronze and gold
the enemy storms down on the rolling hulls nonstop , desperate , life or death
they slaughter the pick of yearling sheep , the old way , to ceres , giver of laws , to apollo , bacchus who sets us free and juno above all , who guards the bonds of marriage
hector , shining among my combat-loving comrades , i fight away from them the fatal day — but you , the vultures will eat your body raw !
but apollo took his stand on the massive rampart , his mind blazing with death for him but help for troy
but standing clear of the fray achilles ' horses wept from the time they first had sensed their driver 's death , brought down in the dust by man-killing hector
then , as you say , 'tomorrow at daybreak , armed to the hilt for battle ' — we slash to attack against their deep curved hulls !
send me back to the greeks , let me go back to fight new battles
there with the augur ’ s staff sat picus to the life , girt up in the short robe of state , his left hand holding the sacred buckler
here is a great river flowing past you , look — what help can he give you ?
so learn , juturna , the grief that comes your way and don ’ t blame me
i never looked back , she never crossed my mind— creusa , lost—not till we reached that barrow sacred to ancient ceres where , with all our people rallied at last , she alone was missing
under what skies and onto what coasts of the world have we been driven ?
but would i listen ?
but tell me , how do you hope to stop the men from fighting ?
all this will come to pass
he answered him warmly , winged words : antilochus , you want me to fetch an extra gift from my tents , a consolation prize for eumelus ?
so he prayed and the father filled with pity , seeing ajax weep
in a moment they had reached the immortals ' stronghold , steep olympus
it started all for nothing
she sped to the wall in panic , like a madwoman — the nurse went with her , carrying your child
range your men by tribes , even by clans , agamemnon , so clan fights by the side of clan , tribe by tribe
but now you would gladly watch ten troops of achaeans beat you to this feast , first to fight with the ruthless bronze before you !
and both armies now , pulling their lines tighter , trojans and lycians , myrmidons and achaeans closed around the corpse to lunge in battle — terrible war cries , stark clashing of armored men
so he prayed and the father filled with pity , seeing atrides weep
hera 's command — and hephaestus launched his grim inhuman blaze
but if ares or phoebus cares to start things off , if they block achilles and keep him out of action , they will have a fight on their hands , then and there , an all-out fight with us
or come with a word for me ?
that mastermind like zeus , odysseus led those fighters on
and i launch out in tears and desert our native land , the old safe haven , the plains where troy once stood
his driver out of his mind , what mind he had , lost all nerve to wheel his horses round and give the slip to his enemy 's deadly hands and staunch antilochus speared him through the midriff
but any man i catch , trying to skulk behind his long beaked ships , hanging back from battle — he is finished
our rites have already made the life of turnus mine
the warlords dear to the gods and flanking agamemnon strode on ahead , marshaling men-at-arms in files , and down their ranks the fiery-eyed athena bore her awesome shield of storm , ageless , deathless — a hundred golden tassels , all of them braided tight and each worth a hundred oxen , float along the front
is it i who try to overwhelm from the roots up your sinking phrygian state ?
on they went where the thickest fighting broke , churning round cebriones , dauntless polydamas , phalces , orthaeus and veteran polyphetes , palmys , hippotion 's two sons — ascanius , morys — fresh reserves just come from ascania 's fertile soil , just last morning , but now great zeus incited all-out war
and next , keen mnestheus took his stand , bow drawn , aiming higher , his eye and shaft both trained on the mark but he had no luck , he missed the bird itself , his shaft just slit a knot in the hempen cord that tied her foot as the dove dangled high from the soaring mast and off she flew to the south and the dark clouds
and paris , magnificent as a god , replied , ah hector , you criticize me fairly , yes , nothing unfair , beyond what i deserve
hand them over to him , the people left from the burnt ships and those worn out by the vast endeavor you ’ ve begun , your destiny , your fate
the queen stopped but he , warned by jupiter now , his gaze held steady , fought to master the torment in his heart
but the argive fighters ?
no good luck guides his probes , apollo the master lends no help , and all the while the ruthless horror of war grows greater , grimmer throughout the field , a disaster ever closer
but now — you fill me with contempt — what are you saying ?
and soaring ash trees ring to the two-edged iron axe and they bring down pines that towered toward the skies
and first they build an immense pyre of resinous pitch-pine and oaken logs , weaving into its flanks dark leaves and setting before it rows of funereal cypress , crowning it all with the herald ’ s gleaming arms
athena halted beside him , let her challenge fly : here 's glory , son of lycaon — let me tempt you , you with your archer 's skill !
book sixteen : patroclus fights and dies
as he hangs back , the fatal spear of aeneas streaks on— spotting a lucky opening he had flung from a distance , all his might and main
when zeus dispenses gifts from the jar of sorrows only , he makes a man an outcast — brutal , ravenous hunger drives him down the face of the shining earth , stalking far and wide , cursed by gods and men
all right then , you rutulians , beg for war !
i will never yield , you will never mount our towers , never drag our women back to your ships of war — i will pack you off to the god of darkness first !
he would just turned his chariot round in flight and once he would swerved diomedes ' spear went punching through his back , gouging his shoulder blade and driving through his chest — he spilled from the chariot , armor clanging against him
i do not blame agamemnon , our commander in chief , for goading his combat-ready argives into battle
coming by many routes , it ’ s there we meet , our rendezvous
driven by guilt , he looked for ways to kill me , he never rested until , making calchas his henchman— but why now ?
collapsing onto his wound , his armor clanging over him , pallas dies , pounding enemy earth with his bloody mouth as turnus trumpets over him : you arcadians , listen !
he 's made a slaughter , i tell you
the fates bind up the last threads of lausus ’ life as aeneas drives his tempered sword through the youth , plunging it home hilt-deep
here are twelve brave sons of the proud trojans — all , the fire that feeds on you devours them all but not hector the royal son of priam , hector i will never give to the hungry flames — wild dogs will bolt his flesh !
if fate and our own wits had not gone against us , surely laocoön would have driven us on , now , to rip the greek lair open with iron spears and troy would still be standing— proud fortress of priam , you would tower still !
what ’ s left for me now , after all i have endured ?
and then , when he sees the entire sky serene , all clear , he gives the trumpet signal from his stern and we strike camp at once , set out on our way and spread our canvas wings
an arcadian angler skilled at working the rivers of lerna stocked with fish , his lodgings poor , a stranger to all the gifts of the great , and his father farmed his crops on rented land
but you , my child , stay here by the fast ships , rage on at the achaeans , just keep clear of every foray in the fighting
and let her marry her phrygian lover , be his slave and give her tyrians over to your control , her dowry in your hands !
acestes born in troy will give you cattle , two head for every ship
and time and again our dardan shores have sweated blood ?
who was the first he slaughtered , who the last , hector the son of priam , now zeus gave him glory ?
he writhes in death as blood flows over his shapely limbs , his neck droops , sinking over a shoulder , limp as a crimson flower cut off by a passing plow , that droops as it dies or frail as poppies , their necks weary , bending their heads when a sudden shower weighs them down
so he said , and under his narrow sloped roof he led the great aeneas , laid him down on a bed of fallen leaves and the hide of a libyan bear
but you , you gave way to your overbearing anger , disgraced a great man the gods themselves esteem — you seized his gift of honor and keep her still
hector — where did you leave the captain when you came ?
but in charged ajax , shield like a tower before him and hector , falling back on a crowd of comrades , leapt to his chariot , flinging the burnished gear to his waiting troops to haul away to troy — trophies to be his own enormous glory
the son of atreus dug a heel in his heaving chest and wrenched the ash spear out
grand hospitality is yours , you rule so many men
have you no heart at all to fight the gutting fire from the fast trim ships ?
so great zeus declared and ordered the healing god to treat the god of war
and he stabbed menelaus ' round shield , full center , not battering through — the brazen point bent back in the tough armor
how often menelaus , my good soldier , would host him in our halls , in the old days , when he would sail across from crete
assigned the nearest place to the world of light , the first to rise to the air above , his blood mixed with italian blood , he bears an alban name
come , up with you now , climb aboard my chariot !
by this sign the great lord of olympus has decreed that you should bear off honors far from all the rest
schooled in suffering , now i learn to comfort those who suffer too
book one : the rage of achilles
where have they left their ships , what coast ?
i for one , i will never run from his grim assault , i will stand up to the man — see if he bears off glory or i bear it off myself !
his dear father has just sent for the young prince— he means the world to me—and he ’ s bound for carthage now , bearing presents saved from the sea , the flames of troy
he married one of adrastus ' daughters , settled down in a fine wealthy house , with plenty of grainland ringed with row on row of blooming orchards and pastures full of sheep , his own herds
no power can bend awry my will , not if that power sends the country avalanching into the waves , roiling all in floods and plunging the heavens into the dark pit of hell
true , but even on that last day , when the light of life departs , the wretches are not completely purged of all the taints , nor are they wholly freed of all the body ’ s plagues
no hiding your godhood , you can ’ t fool me now
like clashing winds in the vast heavens , bursting forth into battle , matched in spirit , in power—no gust surrendering , one to another , neither the winds nor clouds nor seas : all hangs in the balance , the world gripped in a deadlock
why this sudden outbreak , why these clashes ?
but now the son of mecisteus hacked the force from beneath them both and loosed their gleaming limbs and tore the armor off the dead men 's shoulders
but soon as his son tlepolemus came of age in heracles ' well-built palace walls the youngster abruptly killed his father 's uncle — the good soldier licymnius , already up in years — and quickly fitting ships , gathering partisans , he fled across the sea with threats of the sons and the sons ' sons of heracles breaking at his back
what god commands such power ?
once their hunger was put aside , their appetites content , king evander began : these annual rites , this feast , a custom ages old , this shrine to a great spirit— no hollow superstition , and no blind ignorance of the early gods has forced them on us
there at the very edge of the front gates springs pyrrhus , son of achilles , prancing in arms , aflash in his shimmering brazen sheath like a snake buried the whole winter long under frozen turf , swollen to bursting , fed full on poisonous weeds and now it springs into light , sloughing its old skin to glisten sleek in its newfound youth , its back slithering , coiling , its proud chest rearing high to the sun , its triple tongue flickering through its fangs
no fighter can battle all day long , cut-and-thrust till the sun goes down , if he is starved for food
but i — dear god , my life so cursed by fate
so you could suffer the pains of wretched men ?
hard by , the son of haemon and priest of phoebus and diana , his temples wreathed in the consecrated bands , all white in his robes , brilliant in his array— aeneas confronts him , coursing him down the field and rearing over him as he stumbles , slaughters him , shrouding his brilliant robes with a mighty shade
stunned , he recoiled , swallowing back his words like a man who threads his way through prickly brambles , pressing his full weight on the ground , and blindly treads on a lurking snake and back he shrinks in instant fear as it rears in anger , puffs its blue-black neck
turnus , his eyes trained on the awesome young girl , responded : pride of italy , princess , what can i do or say to show my thanks ?
something greater— a god—is speeding you back to greater exploits
so retreat to troy
one warrior wildly tears a helmet from his house , one yokes his panting , stamping team to a chariot , donning his shield and mail , triple-meshed in gold and he straps a trusty sword around his waist
join hands in pacts of peace while you still have the chance
i will give him the breastplate i took from asteropaeus
nor could the trojans once break through the argives ' bulking forward mass and force their passage through to ships and shelters
with that , apollo settled onto pergamus heights while murderous ares , wading into the fighting , spurred the trojan columns on to mass attack
the swift runner achilles reassured him quickly : all will be done , old priam , as you command
aeneas like aegaeon who , they say , had a hundred arms and a hundred hands , and flames blazed from his fifty maws and chests when he fought down jupiter ’ s bolts of lightning , clashing as many matching shields , unsheathing as many swords— so aeneas now , rampaging in triumph all across the plain , once his sword had warmed to the slaughter
healers are working over them , using all their drugs , trying to bind the wounds — but you are intractable , achilles !
my heart races to help our trojans — they long for me , sorely , whenever i am gone
soon his envoys , having covered the distance , sight the latins ’ rising roofs and towers and go up under the walls
all the achaean soldiers roared out their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking lord 's reply , and king agamemnon rounded on idaeus : there , there 's the achaeans ' answer , idaeus — a declaration — you can hear for yourself
and you , goddess , mother , don ’ t fail me in this , my hour of doubt !
all obey me now
horses go to the trojans bound for tuscan fields , and marked for aeneas , a special mount decked out in a tawny lion ’ s skin that gleams with gilded claws
and they listened gladly , nodding at his decision , wiped the dust from their backs and pulled their shirts on
there aeneas hails evander with winning words : best of the sons of greece , fortune has decreed that i pray to you for help , extend this branch of olive wound in wool
bronze he flung in the blaze , tough , durable bronze and tin and priceless gold and silver , and then , planting the huge anvil upon its block , he gripped his mighty hammer in one hand , the other gripped his tongs
wreathed in flowers the one who halloos the hunt cried out at once , your own wife , father !
then when the sun went down and night came on they made their beds and slept by the stern-cables
wounded himself , he gripped his right arm hard , aching where teucer 's arrow had hit him squarely , assaulting the argive wall , when teucer saved his men
and i was the first , mother , i urged them all , 'appease the god at once !
but while he begged the sword goes plunging clean through euryalus ’ ribs , cleaving open his white chest
backing him now comes periphas , giant fighter , automedon too , achilles ’ henchman , charioteer who bore the great man ’ s armor—backing pyrrhus , the young fighters from scyros raid the palace , hurling firebrands at the roofs
that soldier the comrades carried off but idomeneus , giving the healers orders , made for his own tent though he still yearned for action face-to-face
and the god-sprung hero left his spear on the bank , propped on tamarisks — in he leapt like a frenzied god , his heart racing with slaughter , only his sword in hand , whirling in circles , slashing — hideous groans breaking , fighters stabbed by the blade , water flushed with blood
for absent aeneas , a chariot , twin chargers too , sprung from immortal stock , their nostrils flaring fire , born of the mixed breed that crafty circe bred , making off with one of her father ’ s stallions to mate him with a mare
but not these trojans — no one can glut their lust for battle !
nor did i ever dream my leaving could have brought you so much grief
the queen mother burned with a will to wed him to her daughter , true , but down from the gods came sign on sign of alarm to block the way
how could anyone fair and just underrate your work in battle ?
we ’ ve other unwed girls in latian and laurentine fields , and no mean stock at that
call it cunning or courage : who would ask in war ?
confusion reigns at once , the people ’ s spirits distraught , raked by the spur of rage
happy , all too happy i would have been if only the trojan keels had never grazed our coast
orsilochus first , then ormenus , ophelestes , daetor and chromius , princely lycophontes , polyaemon 's son amopaon and melanippus too — corpse on corpse he dropped to the earth that rears us all
but the son of cronus , zeus , stole glaucus ' wits away
else i would gone down at achilles ' hands , athena 's too — the goddess sweeping before him lent the light of safety , calling achilles on that day with his bronze spear to slaughter leleges and trojans
as halaesus guarded imaon , the hapless fighter left his chest defenseless , bared to the arcadian lance
then into an ancient wood and the hidden dens of beasts they make their way , and down crash the pines , the ilex rings to the axe , the trunks of ash and oak are split by the driving wedge , and they roll huge rowans down the hilly slopes
but then menelaus ' pair dropped back as he yielded , cut the pace on purpose — he feared the massive teams would collide on the track and the tight-strung cars capsize , the men themselves go sprawling into the dust , striving , wild for triumph
on they stalked through armor and black pools of blood and suddenly reached their goal , the thracian outpost
draw your armies up where the wild fig tree stands , there , where the city lies most open to assault , the walls lower , easily overrun
all night long the ghost of stricken patroclus hovered over me , grieving , sharing warm tears , telling me , point by point , what i must do
father neptune , what are you whipping up for us now ?
three times they have tried that point , hoping to storm troy , their best fighters led by the great and little ajax , famous idomeneus , atreus ' sons , valiant diomedes
and there in the thick of it all the queen is mustering her armada , clacking her native rattles , still not glimpsing the twin vipers hovering at her back , as anubis barks and the queen ’ s chaos of monster gods train their spears on neptune , venus , and great minerva
they would never starve for fodder — crammed with the fighters — bred to eat their fill
cries rock the ramparts , up and down the walls— they ’ re tensing murderous bows , whipping spear-straps , weapons strewing the ground , shields and hollow helmets ringing out under impact—fighting surges , raging strong as a tempest out of the west when the kids are rising great with rain that lashes the earth , and thick and fast as the hail that stormclouds shower , pelting headlong down on the waves when jupiter fierce with southwinds spins a whirlwind , thunderheads exploding down the sky
so , though shame and anger spur them to all-out war , still they bar the gates , they follow their orders , armed to the hilt , protected inside the turrets , bracing for the foe
now 's the time for killing !
but catillus ’ shaft goes hammering through him , quivering out his broad back and it doubles up the man impaled with pain
but teucer — quick with his next shaft the archer aimed at hector , at hector 's brazen crest , and would have stopped his assault on argive ships , hit him squarely and torn his life out just as his courage peaked
but first antiphates , he was the first to charge , sarpedon ’ s bastard son by a mother born in thebes— but turnus cuts him down , his italian cornel spearshaft wings through the melting air and piercing the man ’ s stomach thrusts up into his chest , and froth from the wound ’ s black pit comes bubbling up as the steel heats in the lung it struck
with powerful hands he steps the mast from serestus ’ ship and tethers atop it , looped by a cord , a fluttering dove , a mark for steel-shod arrows
so he will boast , i know — let the great earth gape and take me down that day !
then , yes , when the king could see the man 's power at last , a true son of the gods , he pressed him hard to stay , he offered his own daughter 's hand in marriage , he gave him half his royal honors as the king
the longed-for day arrived as the horses of phaëthon brought the ninth dawn on through skies serene and bright
restless charioteers flank them , patting their chests , slapping with cupped hands , and groom their rippling manes
bragging so , but the whizzing arrow had not brought him down
down he leapt from his chariot fully armed , hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face : but the argives closed ranks , did not cave in
such pain as zeus has given me , above all others !
give him back to me , now , no more delay — i must see my son with my own eyes
but we do have sound advice , if only you will yield
a tree , once , that a craftsman ’ s hands have sheathed in hammered bronze and given the chiefs of latium ’ s state to wield
so white the achaeans turned beneath the dust storm now , pelting across their faces , kicked up by horses ' hoofs to the clear bronze sky — the battle joined again
at his last words a serpent slithered up from the shrine ’ s depths , drawing its seven huge coils , seven rolling coils calmly enfolding the tomb , gliding through the altars : his back blazed with a maze of sea-blue flecks , his scales with a sheen of gold , shimmering as a rainbow showers iridescent sunlight arcing down the clouds
now cheering a soldier on , tongue-lashing the next if they marked a straggler hanging back from battle : friends — you in the highest ranks of argives , you in the midst and you in rank and file , we can not all be equal in battle , ever , but now the battle lies before us all — come , see for yourselves , look straight down
there aphrodite quickly brought her a chair , the goddess herself with her everlasting smile , and set it down , face-to-face with paris
in a flash , superior numbers overwhelm us
i beg you , king , by the powers who know the truth , by any trust still uncorrupt in the world of men , pity a man whose torment knows no bounds
that achaean bulwark giant ajax came up first , broke the trojan line and brought his men some hope , spearing the bravest man the thracians fielded , acamas tall and staunch , eussorus ' son
high as the black-skin beans and chickpeas bounce and leap from a big bladed shovel , flying across the threshing floor , sped by a whistling wind and a winnower 's sweeping stroke — so the arrow flew from fighting atrides ' breastplate , the keen shaft glancing , skittering off downfield
but it 's my turn now , diomedes
now on we go to the latian king , his city walls
athena winged a heron close to their path and veering right
a bolt of lightning suddenly splits the heavens , drumming thunder—the world seems to fall in a flash , the blare of etruscan trumpets blasting through the sky
even laurentines , even latins change their tune , men who had just now longed for peace and safety long for weapons , pray the pact be dashed and pity the unjust fate that turnus faces
let the rest of them cut themselves to pieces on the plain !
the slashing spear shuddered tense in his guts and the man was gone
from the opposing rampart turnus saw them coming on , his italians saw them too and an icy chill of dread ran through their bones
they would never disengage from automedon , not without some bloodshed
hector far in the lead , bristling in all his force like a hound that harries a wild boar or lion — hot pursuit , snapping quick at his heels , hindquarters and flanks but still on alert for him to wheel and fight — so hector harried the long-haired argives , killing the last stragglers , man after lagging man and they , they fled in panic
far stronger , the king in his anger drove him out of argos , the kingdom zeus had brought beneath his scepter
little by little she grew cold , and wholly freed of her body , laid down her head as her neck drooped limp in the clutch of death , and she let her weapons fall
enough for me to escape that barbarous crew !
suddenly turnus flashes forward , certain he ’ s in the clear and raising his sword high , rearing to full stretch strikes—as trojans and anxious latins shout out , with the gaze of both armies riveted on the fighters
circling the center , ten strong rings of bronze with twenty disks of glittering tin set in , at the heart a boss of bulging blue steel and there like a crown the gorgon 's grim mask — the burning eyes , the stark , transfixing horror — and round her strode the shapes of rout and fear
but just as he was about to reach the steep city , up under the walls , the father of men and gods , descending out of the heavens , took his throne on the high ridge of ida with all her springs
urging , the goddess laid the armor down at achilles ' feet and the gear clashed out in all its blazoned glory
and a troop of pylian chiefs turned out in force to carve up the spoils
clasping our host ’ s hands , we file toward his palace
the field is a swirl of blinding dust , the earth quaking under their thundering tread
our enemies will arm us to the hilt
apart at the prow , aeneas takes his stand , crowned with a trim olive wreath , and raises a wine bowl high and scatters innards over the salt swell and tips out streams of wine
no , poseidon kept his watch and down he came to the file of kings like an old veteran now , he tugged at the right hand of atreus ' son and sent his message flying : agamemnon — now , by heaven , achilles ' murderous spirit must be leaping in his chest , filled with joy to behold his comrades slain and routed in their blood
but the white-armed hera saw her move at once and winged athena on : just look at them there — daughter of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder , tireless one , athena
the arms are enough for him — priam 's son with his empty , futile boasting
they rushed to arms and all the gates flung wide and the trojan mass surged out , horses , chariots , men on foot — a tremendous roar went up
my heart burned with longing , irresistible longing to see my old friend and learn about this remarkable twist of fate
your friends are restored to you , your fleet ’ s reclaimed
and zeus saw hector sprawled on the battlefield , his comrades kneeling round him as he panted , struggling hard for breath , his senses stunned , vomiting blood
but you , you just stand there — do not even command the rest to brace and defend their wives
he passed them on to deipylus , a friend-in-arms he prized beyond all comrades his own age — their minds worked as one — to drive to the ships as sthenelus mounted behind his own chariot now , seized the glittering reins and whipped his team , his strong-hoofed horses ahead at breakneck speed , rearing , plunging to overtake his captain diomedes but he with his ruthless bronze was hunting aphrodite — diomedes , knowing her for the coward goddess she is , none of the mighty gods who marshal men to battle , neither athena nor enyo raider of cities , not at all
atreus ' son drew forth the dagger always slung at his battle-sword 's big sheath , cut some tufts from the lambs ' heads , and heralds passed them round to achaean and trojan captains
you ’ re running away—from me ?
and i ’ ll be there , if i can count on your own good will in this— i ’ ll bind them in lasting marriage , make them one
see if i prove a coward dawn to dusk — your claim — or i stop some argive , blazing in all his power , from fighting on to shield patroclus ' corpse !
there was a tower soaring high at the peak toward the sky , our favorite vantage point for surveying all of troy and the greek fleet and camp
automedon brought the bread , set it out on the board in ample wicker baskets
she even darts into forests , feigning she ’ s in the grip of bacchus ’ power , daring a greater outrage , rising to greater fury , hiding her daughter deep in the mountains ’ leafy woods to rob the trojans of marriage , delay the marriage torch
the whole city of troy comes trampling down on us , daring , wild — why ?
and we , poor fools—on this , our last day—we deck the shrines of the gods with green holiday garlands all throughout the city
what end , great king , do you set to their ordeals ?
a spearhead punched his gullet under the chin and the bronze point went ripping through his nape and down the trojan fell as an oak or white poplar falls or towering pine that shipwrights up on a mountain hew down with whetted axes for sturdy ship timber — so he stretched in front of his team and chariot , sprawled and roaring , clawing the bloody dust
a man is down we prized on a par with noble hector — aeneas , proud anchises ' son
her voice rang out in tears and the women wailed in answer and hecuba led them now in a throbbing chant of sorrow : hector , dearest to me by far of all my sons
but when at the third assault the whole front locked fast , fighting hand-to-hand , and each man picked out his man , then , truly , the groans of the dying men break loose , weapons , bodies , a sea of blood , massacred riders , half-dead horses writhing together now in death and the pitched battle peaks
his was the mare atrides harnessed , champing for the race
but his treacherous blade breaks off , it fails turnus in mid-stroke—enraged , his one recourse , retreat , and swifter than eastwinds , turnus flies as soon as he sees that unfamiliar hilt in his hand , no defense at all
who knows if i will ever come back to them again ?
sergestus gains the lead as they near the rock but not by a whole keel ’ s length—his prow ’ s ahead but the dragon ’ s pressing prow overlaps his stern , so mnestheus , striding the gangplank , spurs his crew : now put your backs in the oars , you comrades of hector !
and springing out of the lines aeneas took his stand as the rest swung round and braced to meet the argives
so hector swooped now , swinging his whetted sword and achilles charged too , bursting with rage , barbaric , guarding his chest with the well-wrought blazoned shield , head tossing his gleaming helmet , four horns strong and the golden plumes shook that the god of fire drove in bristling thick along its ridge
you — you claimed your birth from a river 's broad stream ?
it 's no quick skirmish shaping , once the massed formations of men begin to clash with a god breathing fury in both sides at once
but nothing can halt the trojans ’ fierce offensive now , no weapons can stop them , nothing stand against them
inachus and acrisius , mycenae to the core !
so come — we too , old king , must think of food
three men killed for the one you bragged about so much !
the struck crag shudders , oars slamming against its riptooth edges split , and the prow driven onto the rock , hangs there , hoisted into the air
tomorrow aeneas and lovesick dido plan to hunt the woods together , soon as the day ’ s first light climbs high and the titan ’ s rays lay bare the earth
and opposing them comes antony leading on the riches of the orient , troops of every stripe— victor over the nations of the dawn and blood-red shores and in his retinue , egypt , all the might of the east and bactra , the end of the earth , and trailing in his wake , that outrage , that egyptian wife !
andromache pressed the child to her scented breast , smiling through her tears
now he 's only testing us , soon he will bear down hard
with you i will end , my king , with you i will begin , since you hold sway over many warriors , vast armies , and zeus has placed in your hands the royal scepter and time-honored laws , so you will advise them well
iris flies , arcing down on her rainbow showering iridescence , and no one sees the virgin glide along the shore , past the huge assembly , catching sight of the harbor all deserted now , and the fleet they left unguarded
why , it 's as if they had caught you in public , doing something wrong
you fool — you still have plenty of pain to suffer for her sake
incensed , he let loose with a bronze-tipped arrow aimed at one euchenor , son of the prophet polyidus , a decent , wealthy man who made his home in corinth
if only this murderous scourge drops dead beneath my strokes , back i ’ ll go to my fathers ’ towns—unsung !
come — now thrill to fight as before , brave among the brave , but now be braver still !
gripped by the same desire , all hands pitch in , they hoist and haul
how fate compelled the worlds of europe and asia to clash in war !
seizing his moment turnus calls : summon your councils , sit there praising peace !
she can ’ t conceive of such a fiery passion
now giant ajax speared him through the belt , deep in the guts the long , shadowy shaft stuck and down he fell with a crash as glorious ajax rushed to strip his armor — trojans showering spears against him , points glittering round him , his shield taking repeated hits
but i will blame menelaus , loved as he is and honored , even if you will wheel on me in anger — i must , i ca not hide it now
but all the same i will never stop till i drive the trojans to their bloody fill of war !
he leapt from his chariot , hit the ground at a run through enemies , trojan spears , and left his sister grieving as he went bursting through the lines
here wait those souls consumed by the harsh , wasting sickness , cruel love , concealed on lonely paths , shrouded by myrtle bowers
he pitched from his car , armor clanged against him , a glimmering blaze of metal dazzling round his back — the purebreds reared aside , hoofs pawing the air and his life and power slipped away on the wind
tight formations led by hector careering breakneck on like a deadly rolling boulder torn from a rock face — a river swollen with snow has wrenched it from its socket , immense floods breaking the bank 's grip , and the reckless boulder bounding high , flying with timber rumbling under it , nothing can stop it now , hurtling on undaunted down , down till it hits the level plain and then it rolls no more for all its wild rush
it 's solid bronze with a glittering overlay of tin , rings on rings
but along the shore as battle lines of breakers crashed and dragged , achilles lay down now , groaning deep from the heart , near his myrmidon force but alone on open ground where over and over rollers washed along the shore
but give my body to friends to carry home again , so trojan men and trojan women can do me honor with fitting rites of fire once i am dead
still , this time i will yield , for all my outrage
your sons ’ sons must keep it pure forever
but if you want action now — sleeping is just as hard for you , it seems — come , let 's go down to the sentry-line and see if numb with exhaustion , lack of sleep , they have nodded off , all duty wiped from their minds , the watch dissolved
but now , the moment the son of crooked cronus allows me to seize some glory here at the ships and pin these argives back against the sea — you fool , enough !
only a few , loved by impartial jove or borne aloft to the sky by their own fiery virtue—some sons of the gods have made their way
but achilles wept , and slipping away from his companions , far apart , sat down on the beach of the heaving gray sea and scanned the endless ocean
aletes , bowed with the years , a seasoned adviser , cried out : gods of our fathers , troy ’ s eternal shield !
the brocaded purple stirs him , king that he is , and priam ’ s scepter too , but he is stirred far more , dwelling long on his daughter ’ s marriage , her wedding bed , and mulling deeply over the vision of old faunus
but the god of luck now spread the gates for the old man , drove in the glinting gifts for peleus ' swift son , climbed down from behind the team and said to priam , old man , look , i am a god come down to you , i am immortal hermes — my father sent me here to be your escort
her phantom sifting through my fingers , light as wind , quick as a dream in flight
and he 's going to reap the fruits of it , i swear
twelve sons we were of the noble old neleus and i alone was left
the lord of men replied , you are right , old soldier
never has such a lust for goddess or mortal woman flooded my pounding heart and overwhelmed me so
hardy paphlagonians , working over him , hoisting him onto a chariot , bore him back to the sacred walls of troy
book thirteen : battling for the ships
he lost his reins , he lost control of his horses round the post and they failed to make the turn — that 's where he got thrown , i would say , his chariot smashed and his horses went berserk and bolted off
if it please the gods that nothing of our great city shall survive—if you are bent on adding your own death to the deaths of troy and of all your loved ones too , the doors of the deaths you crave are spread wide open
how well i knew the thrill of a boy ’ s first glory in arms , the heady sweetness of one ’ s first fame in battle
they obeyed and spread the bed as he ordered , with fleeces , woolen throws and soft linen sheets
hear the challenge of paris , the man who caused our long hard campaign
i had no fear of you as a captain of the greeks , arcadia-born and bound by blood to atreus ’ twin sons
so she cried , dashing out of the royal halls like a madwoman , her heart racing hard , her women close behind her
if another comrade would escort me , though , there would be more comfort in it , confidence too
enough—more than enough—that i have seen one sack of my city , once survived its capture
you fill me with contempt — what are you saying ?
hear your royal kings !
but not even then were his men without a captain , yearn as they did for their lost leader
do i stay with them , waiting for you to come ?
and deep in a hollow cave she came on thetis
the other girl , just now the heralds came and led her away from camp , briseus ' daughter , the prize the armies gave me
you and your ranting slander — you are the outrage
ajax skilled as a show-rider , a virtuoso horseman who picks from the herd four stallions , yokes them tight and galloping off the plain comes racing toward a large city , over a trafficked road and the crowds gaze in wonder , men and women watching , as sure-footed , never a slip , the rider keeps on leaping , swinging from back to back and the pounding team flies on
but now after all my trojans suffered , still the same disastrous fortune drives them on and on
and there in the midst , armed in gleaming bronze , in all his glory , he towered high over all his fighters — he was the greatest warlord , he led by far the largest army
a long wandering path will part you miles from that shore by a lengthy stretch of coast
your armies turning over their lives to your command — responsibilities so heavy
and just so on the other side achaean men-at-arms piled the corpses on the pyre , their hearts breaking , burned them down to ash and returned to the hollow ships
shields clang and under the trampling feet the earth quakes in fear
but juno , looking out from a ridge now called the alban mount— then it had neither name , renown nor glory—gazed down on the plain , on italian and trojan armies face-to-face , and latinus ’ city walls
and the men like gangs of reapers slashing down the reaping-rows and coming closer , closer across the field of a warlord rich in wheat or barley — swaths by the armfuls falling thick-and-fast — so achaeans and trojans closed and slashed , lunging into each other and neither side now had a thought of flight that would have meant disaster
seeing his anger flare , field marshal agamemnon smiled broadly and took back his taunts at once : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician , i must not bait you so beyond the limit
at this , the heaving rage subsides in his chest
so in the years to come poseidon and god apollo would set all things to rights once more
but once she reached the tower where soldiers massed she stopped on the rampart , looked down and saw it all — saw him dragged before the city , stallions galloping , dragging hector back to achaea 's beaked warships — ruthless work
and there among them a young boy plucked his lyre , so clear it could break the heart with longing , and what he sang was a dirge for the dying year , lovely
your armies turning over their lives to your command — responsibilities so heavy
and the people massed , streaming into the marketplace where a quarrel had broken out and two men struggled over the blood-price for a kinsman just murdered
take it to heart , i urge you
he summons mercury , gives him marching orders : quick , my son , away !
ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , god of glory !
and not only trojans pay the price in blood— at times the courage races back in their conquered hearts and they cut their enemies down in all their triumph
all face the sea at the far edge of sandy pylos and the men who live within them , rich in sheep-flocks , rich in shambling cattle , will honor him like a god with hoards of gifts and beneath his scepter 's sway live out his laws in sleek and shining peace
aeneas adds the scepter ilione used to bear , the eldest daughter of priam ; a necklace too , strung with pearls , and a crown of double bands , one studded with gems , the other , gold
they cringe from the daylight , shrink from what they ’ ve done
the rage of kings is strong , they are nursed by the gods , their honor comes from zeus — they are dear to zeus , the god who rules the world
achilles had caught them once on the spurs of ida , bound them with willow ropes as they watched their flocks and set them free for ransom
aeneas most of all , devoted to his shipmates , deep within himself he moans for the losses
and i will add a dowry , yes , a magnificent treasure the likes of which no man has ever offered with his daughter !
you achaeans gave her , now you have snatched her back
volcens burns with fury , stymied—where can he find the one who threw it ?
for the men will turn their minds toward home at once , and we must leave priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen , queen of argos
even so , we pity these argive spearmen living out their grim fates , dying in blood
coroebus is first to go , cut down by peneleus ’ right hand he sprawls at minerva ’ s shrine , the goddess , power of armies
but the giant bellowing ares had heard nothing yet of how his son went down in the mounting carnage
but give no ground — the charge will go to pieces
and the winning hero atrides gave his own prize to his herald talthybius — the king 's burnished trophy
but great ajax next — dear to the gods he hurled and his spear 's shadow flew and the shaft hit hector 's round shield , hit full center — straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked , tearing the war-shirt , close by hector 's flank it jabbed but the trojan swerved aside and dodged black death
but now , at long last , i have tasted food again and let some glistening wine go down my throat
next the men who lived in pylos and handsome arene , thryon , the alpheus ford and finely-masoned aepy , men who lived in cyparisseis and amphigenia , pteleos , helos and dorion where the muses met the thracian thamyris , stopped the minstrel 's song
never , not without a struggle , not at their royal ease are they going to board those ships !
others have choked the cramped streets , weapons brandished now in a battle line of naked , glinting steel tense for the kill
for your sake i am able to bear such hardships
not far from aeolian lipare flanked by sicily ’ s coast , an island of smoking boulders surges from the sea
at the same moment jove adeptly spurs on juno : my own sister , my sweet wife as well , it ’ s venus , just as you thought , your judgment never fails
minos the grand inquisitor stirs the urn , he summons the silent jury of the dead , he scans the lives of those accused , their charges
it reared in agony , arrow piercing its brain and flung the team in panic , writhing round the brazen point as the old horseman hewed the trace-horse clear , hacked away the straps — sudden strokes of his sword
achilles sprang from a goddess — one i reared myself : i brought her up and gave her in marriage to a man , to peleus , dearest to all your hearts , you gods
the sacred rites were all performed for the victim , the salted meal strewn , the bands tied round my head
so now i will tell you what seems best to me
diores ' rugged son automedon did his best , lashed them over and over with stinging whip — coaxing them gently now , now shouting oath on oath
and now i pass to the world below , my ghost in all its glory
nearby i chanced on a rise of ground topped off by thickets bristling dogwood and myrtle spears
so odysseus prayed and athena heard his prayer , put spring in his limbs , his feet , his fighting hands and just as the whole field came lunging in for the trophy ajax slipped at a dead run — athena tripped him up — right where the dung lay slick from bellowing cattle the swift runner achilles slew in patroclus ' honor
down and conduct king priam there through achaea 's beaked ships , so none will see him , none of the argive fighters recognize him now , not till he reaches peleus ' royal son
steep banks overhung its whole length , jutting up on either side and topped by stabbing rows of stakes , planted there by the argives , thickset and huge to block the enemy 's onslaught
let zeus decide the fates of the men of troy and men of argos both , to his deathless heart 's content — that is only right
now death and fate have got him in their grip
heading straight for the city 's lofty ramparts , ragged with thirst , choked with dust from the plain they fled as achilles stormed them , shaking his spear , that wild rabid frenzy always gripping his heart , blazing to seize his glory
so let her come
i know it all , how to charge in the rush of plunging horses — i know how to stand and fight to the finish , twist and lunge in the war-god 's deadly dance
none of the bronze plate could hold it , boring through the metal and skull the brazen spearpoint pounded , damasus ' brains splattered all inside his casque — polypoetes beat him down despite the trojan 's rage , then pylon and ormenus , killed and stripped them both
— though i or another hero drags him back in chains
so much to say
king latinus himself , shocked by the sudden crisis , leaves the council , delays his own noble plans till a better hour , over and over faults himself for not embracing trojan aeneas with open arms , adopting him as his son to shield the city
but pallas takes him first—hisbo rushing in fury , off his guard , berserk with his comrade ’ s death as pallas welcomes him in with the naked sword he plunges into his lungs puffed up with rage
now for strength , you need it !
she said the best of the myrmidons — while i lived — would fall at trojan hands and leave the light of day
how many dying bodies do you spread out on the earth ?
nor did your own mother lead her son ’ s cortege or seal your eyes in death or bathe your wounds or shroud you round in the festive robe i wove , speeding the work for you , laboring day and night , lightening with the loom the pains of my old age
he would fight to the death as a panther springs forth from her thicket lair to stand and face the huntsman : no fear in her heart , no thought of flight when she hears the baying packs — and even if he 's too quick with spear or lunging sword , even if she 's run through , she never slacks her fury until she 's charged him hard or gone down fighting
wild as a top , spinning under a twisted whip when boys , obsessed with their play , drive it round an empty court , the whip spinning it round in bigger rings and the boys hovering over it , spellbound , wonderstruck— the boxwood whirling , whip-strokes lashing it into life— swift as a top amata whirls through the midst of cities , people fierce in arms
no help to them now , the weapons of hercules , no , nor their own strong arms or their father melampus , hercules ’ mainstay , long as the earth afforded the man his grueling labors
and the son of cronus sends them signs on the right , zeus 's firebolts flashing
and round it boys and unwed girls sing hymns , thrilled to lay a hand on the dangling ropes as on and on it comes , gliding into the city , looming high over the city ’ s heart
so the trojans held their watch that night but not the achaeans — godsent panic seized them , comrade of bloodcurdling rout : all their best were struck by grief too much to bear
son of the goddess— still alive ?
there is a vast cave , down in the dark sounding depths , mid-sea between tenedos and imbros ' rugged cliffs
once they reached the ford where the river runs clear , the strong , whirling xanthus sprung of immortal zeus , hermes went his way to the steep heights of olympus as dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth , and the two men , weeping , groaning , drove the team toward troy and the mules brought on the body
and then , nearing the gates , thinking we ’ ve all got safely through , i suddenly seem to catch the steady tramp of marching feet and father , peering out through the darkness , cries : run for it now , my boy , you must
never , until i would sat you down on my knees and cut you the first bits of meat , remember ?
so the queen of the gods , saturn ’ s daughter swooping down from the heavens , struck the unyielding doors with her own hand , swinging them on their hinges , bursting open the iron gates of war
as i have seen other men who trust to their own power and striking force , their own valor , their own troop-strength — even badly outmanned — defend their country well
but only if phoenix wishes
you , hector — you are my father now , my noble mother , a brother too , and you are my husband , young and warm and strong !
bucolion , son himself to the lofty king laomedon , first of the line , though his mother bore the prince in secrecy and shadow
many captains sitting some way off , but two , veteran automedon and the fine fighter alcimus were busy serving him
here i sail , and here a haven , still , serene , receives our weary bodies safe and sound
all of it , my king , i ’ ll tell you , come what may , the whole true story
but the old and noble priam protested strongly : do not make me sit on a chair , achilles , prince , not while hector lies uncared-for in your camp !
a god ’ s come down from the sky once more—i ’ ve just seen him—urging us on to sever our mooring cables , sail at once !
and no forgetting the watch , each man wide awake
you will pay me with honors once you have won your way
when the first spray ’ s torn away , another takes its place , gold too , the metal breaks into leaf again , all gold
comrades cried out too with buoyant hearts
hector would not permit it
our wits quicker than wind , our judgment just as flighty
he can hardly recognize him , a cowering shadow hiding his punishments so raw
but any men he saw retreating from hateful battle he would lash with a sharp burst of rage : you argives — glorious braggarts !
the father sat there , silent
and again a desperate battle broke at the ships
here , as cacus spouts his flames in the darkness , all for nothing—hercules grapples him , knots him fast in a death-lock , throttling him , gouging out the eyes in his head , choking the blood in his gullet dry
he sounded out a challenge to peleus ' princely son : you missed , look — the great godlike achilles !
and if the gods are raging now , don ’ t let drances appease them with his death instead of mine
but you , mother , if you have any power at all , protect your son !
for my own death , i will meet it freely — whenever zeus and the other deathless gods would like to bring it on !
away with you , quick !
the track 's too narrow here — it widens soon for passing — watch out — you will crash your chariot , wreck us both !
exposed before our lines to fight the trojans — look how the men of troy have laid you low , trampling down our solemn , binding truce !
the golden boss of his shield spews streams of fire , strong as the lethal , blood-red light of comets streaming on in a clear night , or bright as the dog star , sirius , bearing plague and thirst to afflicted mortals , rises up to shroud the sky with gloom
but standing off to the side his guest declined : no time to sit , old soldier dear to the gods
i give you back to your fathers ’ ash and shades if it offers any solace
and you , father , glorious mars , you who command the revolving world of war beneath your sway !
and now , all day long till the setting sun went down they would have wept for hector there before the gates if the old man , steering the car , had not commanded , let me through with the mules !
send me a bird of omen , your own wind-swift messenger , the dearest bird in the world to your prophetic heart , the strongest thing on wings — clear on the right so i can see that sign with my own eyes and trust my life to it as i venture down to achaea 's ships and the fast chariot-teams !
but the gods ’ will spurred us on to seek your land , their power forced us here
so all etruria rises up in righteous fury , demanding the king , threatening swift attack
all submit to it now , so all the more quickly i can bring this violent business to an end
no trojan your rival here , no lycian can claim to be your better , no — so up with you now !
and the god of luck , leaping onto the chariot right behind the team , quickly grasped the whip and reins in his hands and breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses
— to deceive some other comrade
no one alters our ranked list of winners now
and all day long they fought at the scaean gates , that very day they would have stormed the city too , if apollo had not killed menoetius ' gallant son as he laid the trojans low — apollo cut him down among the champions there and handed hector glory
then picked young men and the altar priest , outdoing themselves , bring on the roasted flesh of bulls and heap the baskets high with the gifts of ceres , wheaten loaves just baked , and in bacchus ’ name they keep the winecups flowing
long before , his accursed doom blacked him out with idomeneus ' spear , deucalion 's noble son
turnus races his chariot straight through the ranks and shouts as he sees his comrades : now ’ s the time to halt your fighting !
the wolf himself autolycus lifted that splendid headgear out of eleon once , he stole it from ormenus ' son amyntor years ago , breaching his sturdy palace walls one night then passed it on to amphidamas , cythera-born , scandia-bound
sitting here , half dead — some trouble 's come your way ?
why recount his unspeakable murders , savage crimes ?
there stood arcens ’ son , decked out in brilliant gear and a war-shirt stitched blood-red with spanish dye , a fine , striking boy
we fight as outlaws
and let the king stand up before the entire army , let agamemnon swear to you his solemn , binding oath : he never mounted her bed , never once made love with her , the natural thing , my lord , men and women joined
and memory of my service past stands firm in grateful minds !
i urge them to cherish their hearths and homes , erect a citadel strong to shield them well
and so it is that horn-hoofed steeds are barred from diana trivia ’ s shrine and holy groves since horses , panicked by monsters of the deep , scattered the man and chariot out along the shore
good eurytion never grudged him this distinction , though he alone shot down the dove from the high sky
so lay anthemion 's son simoisius , cut down by the giant royal ajax
— if you could quit sarpedon , your guest and friend-in-arms abandoned there as carrion fit for the argive maws
next messapus , breaker of horses , neptune ’ s son , a king whom neither fire nor iron could bring down : he suddenly grasps his fighting sword again , calls back to arms his people long at peace , his rusty contingents long at rest from battle
guard it in your heart
the giant himself , his head scrapes the stars !
now buckling on my sword again and working my left arm through the shieldstrap , grasping it tightly , just as i was rushing out , right at the doors my wife , creusa , look , flung herself at my feet and hugged my knees and raised our little iulus up to his father
down from olympus , what heroics stir your heart ?
and now the morning star was mounting above the high crests of ida , leading on the day
so she threatened and helen the daughter of mighty zeus was terrified
so , it 's not enough that you lure defenseless women to their ruin ?
what acclaim from his comrades !
enticing so that the heart in helen 's breast began to race
evander , seizing the hand of his departing son , clinging , weeping inconsolably , cries out : if only jove would give me back the years , all gone , and make me the man i was , killing the front ranks just below praeneste ’ s ramparts , heaping up their shields , torching them in my triumph— my right hand sent great king erulus down to hell !
if a man could gather that , then make it back unharmed , why , what glory he would gain across the whole wide earth in the eyes of every man — and what a gift he would win !
and next with his powerful grip he snatches up a burly spear aslant an enormous central column— plunder seized from an enemy , actor—shakes it hard till the haft quivers and now , my spear , he cries , you ’ ve never failed my call , and now our time has come !
at that , they head for port and a following westwind bellies out their sails
peace from zeus , the great steward on high who rules our mortal wars ?
thanks to you , my sense of honor is gone , my one and only pathway to the stars , the renown i once held dear
they would call me their honored , loving friend forever
any straggler i catch , hanging back from the fleet , right here on the spot i will put that man to death
but great achilles knew nothing yet of patroclus ' death
quick as the wind now iris rushed to the goddess , urging , rise , thetis — zeus with his everlasting counsels calls you now !
the dense woods spread far , the thickets and black ilex bristle , briars crowd the entire place , with a rare track showing a faint trace through the thick blind glades
latins , keep your arms in check !
he inspired his heart with daring , standing near — in person , to beat away the dragging fates of death — leaning against an oak , concealed in swirls of mist
bearing it through the crowd achilles gave it to nestor , standing close beside him , urging , here , old friend — a trophy for you too !
and the mighty gods on steep olympus raged away , impotent — what could they do to set you free ?
what god has put such a tactic in your head ?
but the father knew their feelings deep within his heart and mocked them harshly : why so crushed , athena , hera ?
but if you are threatening some disaster , fortune , let me break this brutal life off now , now while anxieties waver and hopes for the future fade , while you , my beloved boy , my lone delight come lately , i still hold you in my embrace
she flashed the word in helenus ' mantic spirit — the son of priam sensed what pleased the immortals hatching instant plans , and coming up to hector advised him quickly , hector , son of priam , a mastermind like zeus , listen to me now — let your brother guide you
and above their onset zeus who loves the lightning launched from ida 's summits a sudden howling gale that whipped a dust storm hard against the ships , spellbinding achaean units in their tracks , handing glory to hector and hector 's trojans
but once he repels the roaring onslaught from the ships let him come back to me and our fast fleet — unharmed — with all my armor round him , all our comrades fighting round my friend !
ah then a wondrous , honored goddess comes to grace our house !
nine days they lay in their blood , no one to bury them — cronus ' son had turned the people into stone
so wildly turnus , scanning the camp and rampart , flares in anger , brute resentment sears him to the bone
shoulder-to-shoulder , swing to the work , we must — just two as we are — if we hope to make some headway
but sleep could never hold the running escort — hermes kept on turning it over in his mind
your shelters packed with the lion 's share of bronze , plenty of women too , crowding your lodges
not one of you submit to the grip of sleep — you would give great joy to the men who would take our lives
i wo not give up the mare !
king evander , founder of rome ’ s great citadel , begins : these woods the native fauns and the nymphs once held and a breed of mortals sprung from the rugged trunks of oaks
they keep beating his ribs , splintering sticks — their struggle child 's play till with one final shove they drive him off but not before he 's had his fill of feed
and so the lord of the war cry left patroclus , resisting all the way — he feared the worst : stampeded in terror , his men would leave the body easy prey for the trojans
they keep urging the sharp-eyed giant-killer hermes to go and steal the body
woman ’ s a thing that ’ s always changing , shifting like the wind
if you will only hear me out and take my lead , not glare at me in resentment , each of you , since i am the youngest-born in all our ranks
clean out the launching-channels !
but hector swerved his horses round at the trench 's edge , wheeling back and forth , tossing their gorgeous manes , with hector 's eyes glaring bright as a gorgon 's eyes or ares ' , man-destroying ares '
do not wait for the holy dawn to find us here afield , ranged by the ships — we are too far from our walls
and i was in their ranks , fresh out of pylos , far away from home — they enlisted me themselves and i fought on my own , a free lance , single-handed
with your winning words hold back each man you find — do not let them haul their rolling ships to sea !
but come in , rest on this seat with me , dear brother
leave them there , that bow and spill of arrows down on the ground — a god with a grudge against us wrecks them all
unlucky old acoetes , weighed down with the years , they help along as he beats his chest with fists , claws his cheeks with his nails and stumbling on , flings his full length to the ground
but you , my elite ones , who is ready to hack their ramparts down with the sword , to join me now and storm their panicked camp ?
they went straight on , shoulders shielded in oxhide tanned and tough and hammered thick with bronze
her gaze , her whole heart is riveted on him now , and at times she even warms him snugly in her breast , for how can she know , poor dido , what a mighty god is sinking into her , to her grief ?
home we go in our ships !
and once they reached tydides ' sturdy lodge they tethered the horses there with well-cut reins , hitching them by the trough where diomedes ' stallions pawed the ground , champing their sweet barley
taking their pick of daughters , tearing the sworn bride from her husband ’ s arms ?
but never shaken , staunch diomedes shot back , no hit — you missed !
you know how crammed we are inside our city , how far it is to the hills to haul in timber , and our trojans are afraid to make the journey
at other times i might have shrunk from the fighting , true , but not today
but watch , the god with a bough drenched in lethe ’ s dew and drowsy with all the river styx ’ s numbing power shakes it over the pilot ’ s temples left and right and fight as he does , his swimming eyes fall shut
no hope of rescue now
how under eurystheus he endured the countless grueling labors , juno ’ s brutal doom
there is a haven shaped by an island shielding the mouth of a long deep bay , its flanks breaking the force of combers pounding in from the sea while drawing them off into calm receding channels
but you — exalt him , olympian zeus : your urgings rule the world !
then down he went himself to his treasure-chamber , high-ceilinged , paneled , fragrant with cedarwood and a wealth of precious objects filled its chests
and first they visit the altars , make the rounds , praying the gods for blessings , shrine by shrine
and you beneath the ground who punish the dead — whoever broke his oath — be witness here , protect our binding pacts
even these trojans have their tumblers — what a leap !
quick , mount your chariot , mount machaon beside you — lash your team to the warships , fast , full gallop !
but set sail from our land , steer clear of italy ’ s coast , the closest coast to our own , washed by our own seas— every seaboard town is manned by hostile greeks
that is my sworn pledge
no man alive could keep the dog-packs off you , not if they haul in ten , twenty times that ransom and pile it here before me and promise fortunes more — no , not even if dardan priam should offer to weigh out your bulk in gold !
down to the ships we march and bear this corpse on high — we have won ourselves great glory
briseis remained untouched within my tents
but the greek armada was under way now , crossing over from tenedos , ships in battle formation under the moon ’ s quiet light , their silent ally , homing in on the berths they know by heart— when the king ’ s flagship sends up a signal flare , the cue for sinon , saved by the fates ’ unjust decree , and stealthily loosing the pine bolts of the horse , he unleashes the greeks shut up inside its womb
he too will race in flight and wing away , setting his sails to cross the farthest seas
not antilochus , guarded now by the god of earthquakes shielding , ringing the son of nestor round , even in this , this storm of spears
let each chief give commands to the tribe he leads , move them out , marshal his own contingents — now !
and you too , old man , we hear you prospered once : as far as lesbos , macar 's kingdom , bounds to seaward , phrygia east and upland , the hellespont vast and north — that entire realm , they say , you lorded over once , you excelled all men , old king , in sons and wealth
but if you will not obey his orders , if you spurn them , he threatens to come here in person , fight you down , power against power
where could he find them now ?
fill his heart with courage — so even hector learns if patroclus has the skill to fight his wars alone , my friend-in-arms , or his hands can rage unvanquished only when i go wading in and face the grind of battle
and covering over his wound with pain-killing drugs the healer cured him : the god was never born to die
all as one , his comrades murmured yes to drances ’ offer
you talk of food ?
the point 's not lodged in a mortal spot , you see ?
where are you going ?
this powerful hector will never quit the fighting , not till swift achilles rises beside the ships that day they battle against the high sterns , pinned in the fatal straits and grappling for the body of patroclus
he handed back the mare to antilochus ' man
and then , later , achaeans can work to make it broad and lofty , all who survive me here , alive in the benched ships when i am gone
come , stop inflaming us both with your appeals
such a heavy blow
if only the earth gaped deep enough to take me down
and all at once , each vessel snapping her cables free of the bank , they dive like dolphins , plunging headlong beaks to the bottom ’ s depths , then up they surface , turned into lovely virgins—wondrous omen— each a sea-nymph sweeping out to sea
oh , i pray you by these tears , by the faith in your right hand— what else have i left myself in all my pain ? — by our wedding vows , the marriage we began , if i deserve some decency from you now , if anything mine has ever won your heart , pity a great house about to fall , i pray you , if prayers have any place—reject this scheme of yours !
so often you ridicule your son with your disguises !
if only you ’ d left a baby in my arms—our child— before you deserted me !
others were pressing on , forging a chariot ’ s whirling wheels for mars to harrow men and panic towns in war
i fear aeneas — terribly — coming on , top speed , bearing down on me now and filled with power , enormous power to take men down in battle
and headlong hector , delirious with his strength , rages uncontrollably , trusting to zeus — no fear of man or god , nothing — a powerful rabid frenzy has him in its grip !
aeneas takes on rutulian sucro—here was the first duel that ground the trojan charge to a halt—and meets the man with no long visit , just a quick stab in his flank and the ruthless sword-blade splits the ribcage , thrusting into the heart where death comes lightning fast
or if i deserve it , come , hurl what ’ s left of us down to death with all your angry bolts— overwhelm us here with your iron fist !
oh my son , so pressed by the fate of troy—i ’ ve come by the will of jove , who swept the fire from your ships and now from the heights of heaven pities you at last
but turnus wastes no time , he deploys his full force quickly against the trojan force to fight them at the beaches
here tydeus comes to meet him , parthenopaeus shining in arms , and adrastus ’ pallid phantom
nothing beside those other powers , all who rush to defend the trojan armies
you too , i will urge you on with so much winning force
and now aeneas and all his trojan soldiers feast on the oxen ’ s long back cut and sacred vitals
it 's not your fate to be swallowed by a river : he will subside , and soon — you will see for yourself
five great cities , in fact , plant their anvils , forge new weapons : staunch atina , lofty tibur , ardea , crustumerium , antemnae proud with towers
but the father of men and gods , far from blind , throned on his steep olympian peak observes it all and stirs etruscan tarchon into the savage fighting , lashing the trooper on with the rough spur of rage
screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath , fighters killing , fighters killed , and the ground streamed blood
so at dawn you must call a halt to fighting by achaeans , form your units , bring on wagons , gather up the dead and wheel the corpses back with mules and oxen
lost to her friends , her son , her husband—gone forever
as soon as he heard that , the god of earthquakes surged through the clashing troops and raining spears to reach the place where the two famed heroes fought
oh how i wish that first day my mother brought me into the light some black whirlwind had rushed me out to the mountains or into the surf where the roaring breakers crash and drag and the waves had swept me off before all this had happened !
hector drove them on with winging orders : hear me — numberless tribes of allies living round our borders — i neither sought nor needed enormous hordes of men that day i called you here , each from your own city
the hardy spearman meriones shot back , aeneas — great man of war as you are , you will find it hard to quench the fire of every man who fights you
such talk the sordid goddess spreads on the lips of men , then swerves in her course and heading straight for king iarbas , stokes his heart with hearsay , piling fuel on his fire
be with me now , just as you went with father , veteran tydeus , into thebes that day he ran ahead of the argives with his message
not one of you leaves and lacks a gift from me
courage , my friends , hold out a little longer
amphidamas gave it to molus , a guest-gift once that molus gave meriones his son to wear in battle
something terrible 's coming down on priam 's children
so you will bring some joy to achaea 's forces camped beside their ships , and most of all to your own troops , the comrades you command
and polydamas stood by headstrong hector , saying , hector , you always seem to attack me in assembly , despite my good advice
i owed a price to my land and people who despise me
but since you would like a lesson in warfare , artemis , just to learn , to savor how much stronger i am when you engage my power —
that eagle flying high on the left across our front , clutching this bloody serpent in both its talons , still alive — but he let the monster drop at once , before he could sweep it back to his own home
the enemy 's battle-weary — we could roll those broken trojans back to troy , clear of the ships and shelters !
deiphobus shouted , vaunting in wild glory , asius dies , but not without revenge !
that is the only field left free to you now , to prove your worth and fortune
one he stabbed with a bronze lance above the nipple , the other his heavy sword hacked at the collarbone , right on the shoulder , cleaving the whole shoulder clear of neck and back
seven chiefs of the guard , a hundred under each , fighters marching , grasping long spears in their hands , took up new positions between the trench and rampart
i bring you a message sent by zeus , a world away but he has you in his heart , he pities you now
dare to scoff at riches
guest ’ —that ’ s all that remains of husband ’ now
but now , wild as a black cyclone twisting out of a cloudbank , building up from the day 's heat , blasts and towers — so brazen ares looked to tydeus ' son diomedes
but charging down on the trojans ajax killed doryclus , bastard son of priam — he wounded pandocus next , wounded lysander , pyrasus , then pylartes
here dido of tyre was building juno a mighty temple , rich with gifts and the goddess ’ aura of power
you with the north wind 's help had coaxed the gales to send him scudding over the barren salt sea — you , always plotting miseries for my son , you bore him off to the crowded town of cos but there i saved him , whisked him away to safety , back to the stallion-land of argos , worn with torment
but achilles held the armies on the spot
now is the time to prove yourself a spearman , a daring man of war — now , if you are brave , make grueling battle your one consuming passion
and loud as the roar goes up when men cut timber deep in the mountain glades and the pounding din of axes echoes miles away — so the pound and thud of blows came rising up from the broad earth , from the trampled paths of war and the bronze shields and tough plied hides struck hard as the swords and two-edged spearheads stabbed against them
see to the works of marriage , the slow fires of longing
treasures are piled up in my rich father 's house , bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron — father would give you anything , gladly , priceless ransom if only he learns i am still alive in argive ships !
lash your racing horses at ares first , strike him at close range , no shrinking away here before that headlong ares !
here she kept her armor , here her chariot too , and carthage would rule the nations of the earth if only the fates were willing
but not the great field marshal agamemnon — the sweet embrace of sleep could not hold him : his mind kept churning , seething
but why , i ask you ?
you , why are you so afraid of war and slaughter ?
the troops hung on his words and took his orders
but zeus flung strife on achaea 's fast ships , the brutal goddess flaring his storm-shield , his monstrous sign of war in both her fists
look at her beauty , her fiery eyes , immortal marks— what pride , what features , and what a voice , what stride !
and then aeneas orders a hundred envoys , picked from all ranks , to approach the king ’ s imperial city—bearing an olive branch of pallas wound in wool , bearing gifts for the great man— and sue for peace for all the trojan people
but i , if i should die , my comrades-in-arms will bury me in style !
soon as they had gathered within the warlord 's tents he sacrificed an ox in their midst , a full-grown ox , five years old , to the towering son of cronus , zeus
far in the palace depths there stood a laurel , its foliage sacred , tended with awe for many years
not a word to achilles , not a question
so immense the clash as the war of gods erupted
death cut him short
like him , apollo the son of zeus incited hector : hector , why stop fighting ?
he is only the third to offer up to father quirinus the enemy ’ s captured arms
now then , first look up at this crag with its overhanging rocks , the boulders strewn afar
or call his armies now to rally within the ramparts ?
he has no idea of the anguish risen through the army !
let the whole myrmidon army follow your command — you might bring some light of victory to our argives !
and let the hero patroclus bear it on his way
but their master hurled from the chariot , tumbling over the wheel and pitching facedown in the dust , and above him now rose menelaus , his spear 's long shadow looming
by skill , too , the captain holds his ship on course , scudding the wine-dark sea though rocked by gales
patroclus — who was the first you slaughtered , who the last when the great gods called you down to death ?
you , you ’ ll never lose your life , such as it is , not by my right hand—fear not—just let it rest , beating inside that coward ’ s chest of yours !
all power is yours
they beat the helmets hollow to guard the head , they weave the wicker tight to rib their shields , others are pounding breastplates out of bronze , hammering lightweight greaves from pliant silver
the cyclops were forging iron now in the huge cave : thunder and lightning and fire-anvil stripped bare
but if only zeus would stretch the ropes of war dead even the man would have no easy victory then , believe me — not though he claims he 's built of solid bronze !
i , at least , have no real lust to drive our forces against the gods of troy
that moment at jove ’ s command he carries on the fight , attacks the victorious trojans , true , but his own etruscan troops with all their hate and showering weapons rush to attack him quite alone , their one and only target
no , this sword and the man who wields it , the wounds they deal are fatal !
do not leap to extremes
each captain ordered his men and the ranks moved on in silence
now up they came for a better view of the battle , a slow file of kings , leaning on their spears , hearts in their chests weighed down with anguish — and the sight of the old horseman coming toward them struck them all with a sharper sense of dread
i have lived a life
whenever i longed to fight at the ships ' high sterns the old men kept me back , they held the troops in check
so the rule of all aetolian men had passed to thoas
but once he crashed against those dense battalions dead in his tracks he stopped , crushed up against them : sons of achaea faced him now , stabbing away with swords , with two-edged spears , hoisting him off their lines — and he gave ground , staggering , reeling , shouting out to his troops with shrill cries , trojans !
patroclus never saw him coming , moving across the deadly rout , shrouded in thick mist and on he came against him and looming up behind him now — slammed his broad shoulders and back with the god 's flat hand and his eyes spun as apollo knocked the helmet off his head and under his horses ' hoofs it tumbled , clattering on with its four forged horns and its hollow blank eyes and its plumes were all smeared in the bloody dust
suddenly right before camilla , stunned with terror to see her here , stands aunus ’ fighting son , an apennine man and not the least of liguria ’ s liars while the fates allow
but he bore a son who 's not the half of him in battle — better only in wrangling , wars of words !
aeneas , moreover , offers you these gifts , remains of his former riches , meager relics plucked from the fires of burning troy
he quickly loosed an arrow , full-draw force but never swore to the archer he would slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs , so he missed the dove — apollo grudged him that — but he hit the cord that tethered the bird 's foot , the tearing arrow split the cord straight through and the bird shot into the sky and left the tether dangling down to ground
and assaracus fathered capys , and he had a son anchises and anchises fathered me , but priam had prince hector
others seize on weapons , rush to defend the ramparts
smiling down , the creator of man and the wide world returned : now there ’ s my sister
all the while the trojans along the shore keep weeping for misenus , paying his thankless ashes final rites
all empty noise , your peals of grumbling thunder ?
that was the only way you could destroy me
even now in the face of all the immortal gods she harries me perpetually , hera charges me that i always go to battle for the trojans
the ferryman , marveling at the awesome gift , the fateful branch unseen so many years , swerves his dusky craft and approaches shore
but he kept shouting at agamemnon , spewing his abuse : still moaning and groaning , mighty atrides — why now ?
then , with the guests gone , and the dimming moon quenching its light in turn , and the setting stars inclining heads to sleep—alone in the echoing hall , distraught , she flings herself on the couch that he left empty
and then , if we can journey home to achaean argos , pride of the breasting earth , you will be his son-by-marriage
quickly achilles displayed before the troops the prizes set for the third event , the grueling wrestling-match
idomeneus suddenly called to nestor , pride of achaea !
cut off from life so young !
a gift of the son of cronus , zeus — apollo too — they brought me down with all their deathless ease , they are the ones who tore the armor off my back
it 's only youth that got the better of your discretion , just this once — but the next time be more careful
and he excelled all argives with his spear — you must have heard the story , know it 's true
now they see a pillar of dust upholding the sky and the horsemen riding on and dense salvos of weapons raining down in the camp ’ s heart , and the cries of torment reach the heavens as young men fight and die beneath the iron fist of mars
but even for me , i tell you , death and the strong force of fate are waiting
he obeyed the order
such was the fear that broke them , man for man , but the heart within me broke with grief for you
you ca not persuade me now
still , anna can not imagine these outlandish rites would mask her sister ’ s death
the bright-eyed goddess pallas lost no time
so each man tense with courage — fight the trojans down !
not even achilles can bring off all his boasts : some he will accomplish , some cut short , half done
three times illustrious hector shouted for support , seized his feet from behind , wild to drag him off , three times the aeantes , armored in battle-fury fought him off the corpse
and scanning the melee , high on actium ’ s heights apollo bent his bow and terror struck them all , egypt and india , all the arabians , all the sabaeans wheeled in their tracks and fled , and the queen herself— you could see her calling , tempting the winds , her sails spreading and now , now about to let her sheets run free
now nisus guarded a gate— matchless in battle , hyrtacus ’ son , aeneas ’ comrade
do we still flinch from turning our valor into deeds ?
our young men , calloused by labor , used to iron rations , tame the earth with mattocks or shatter towns with war
and he , stalking turnus through the moil of battle , aeneas ’ glances roving left and right , sights the town untouched by this ruthless war , immune , at peace and an instant vision of fiercer combat fires his soul
groans resound from the depths , the savage crack of the lash , the grating creak of iron , the clank of dragging chains
squads of others swarmed and rallied around polydamas , panthous ' friendly son — they would heard hector 's orders
by chance a wild olive , green with its bitter leaves , stood right here , sacred to faunus , revered by men in the old days , sailors saved from shipwreck
but not the tragic queen
no more of your hot insistence — it repels me
still dragging out my life
prove your will with works
transgressors will pay the price , a tremendous price , with their own heads , their wives and all their children
and veteran lycomedes pitied him as he dropped , sweeping beside him , rearing — a flash of his lance and he hit a captain , hippasus ' son apisaon , slitting open his liver , up under the midriff
but prize trophies go to the three front-runners , brows crowned with the wreaths of braided golden olive
the gods on high — they hold the ropes of victory in their hands !
i am , i confess , a man from the greek fleets , i admit i fought to seize your household gods
under your lead , let him grow hard to a soldier ’ s life and the rough work of war
no use , no use as his right hand tugs at the shaft and his clamping forceps grip the iron point
learn good luck from others
so i had to reach the front lines on foot but i shone among our horsemen all the same — that 's how athena called the turns of battle
he rushed at the maenads once , nurses of wild dionysus , scattered them breakneck down the holy mountain nysa
and juno replies , her head bent low : my dearest husband , why rake my anxious heart ?
if i hold out here and i lay siege to troy , my journey home is gone , but my glory never dies
hera deceived him blind — feminine as she is , and only armed with guile — that day in thebes , ringed with tower on tower , alcmena was poised to bear invincible heracles
and if only one would go and call the rest , giant ajax strong as a god and king idomeneus — they are hardly close , their ships last on the line
from there you could hear the furious growls of lions bridling at their chains , roaring into the dead of night , the raging of bristly boars and bears caged in their pens and the looming forms of howling wolves : the men whose shapes the brutal goddess circe changed with her potent drugs , tricked them out in the hides and look of wild beasts
a stunned silence seized them all , struck dumb — zeus 's ringing pronouncements overwhelmed them so
achilles served the meat
if one strong arm could have saved troy , my arm would have saved the city
and now they stretched the line of battle strangling tight , the blue-haired god of the sea and hector fired in arms , he driving the trojans , the god driving the argives — and a wild surf pounded the ships and shelters , squadrons clashed with shattering war cries rising
so great ajax vaunted and men prayed to the son of cronus , king zeus
we breach our own ramparts , fling our defenses open , all pitch into the work
with those words he left her in chryses ' arms and the priest embraced the child he loved , exultant
pandarus , seeing his brother ’ s body spread on the ground and sensing how fortune falls— disaster rules the day—with all his might he rams his massive shoulder into the gate and wheels it shut on its hinges , shuts out many comrades now outside the ramparts , facing an uphill battle , and shuts in many others , ushering fighters home as in they rush , along with himself , the crazy fool— not to have spotted turnus charging in with the crowds and all unwittingly shut him up inside the walls like a claw-mad tiger among some helpless flock
do not alarm the men , not for a moment
the third battalion was led by brave pisander , maemalus ' son , who outfought them all with spears , all the myrmidons after achilles ' friend patroclus
so the ramping , crested aeantes hoisted imbrius high , stripping his gear in mid-air , and the little ajax , raging over amphimachus ' death , lopped the head from the corpse 's limp neck and with one good heave sent it spinning into the milling fighters like a ball , right at the feet of hector , tumbling in the dust
paris lies dead in the city of his fathers , mimas lies unsung on the latian shores
still , by god , i said i would not relax my anger , not till the cries and carnage reached my own ships
first then , back to the looming walls , the shadowy rear gates by which i ’ d left the city , back i go in my tracks , retracing , straining to find my footsteps in the dark , with terror at every turn , the very silence makes me cringe
but take this command to heart — obey it to the end
and away i fled through the whole expanse of hellas and gaining the good dark soil of phthia , mother of flocks , i reached the king , and peleus gave me a royal welcome
but now racing achilles makes my blood run cold
so hector vowed — with an oath he swore in vain but it spurred the man to action
first , for the fastest charioteers he set out glittering prizes : a woman to lead away , flawless , skilled in crafts , and a two-eared tripod , twenty-two measures deep — all that for the first prize
aground on the shoals , long impaled on a jagged reef it teeters back and forth , tiring the waves—and suddenly breaks up , flinging crews in the surf , ensnared in the shattered oars and bobbing thwarts as the heavy backwash drags their feet from shore
with that , shaft poised , he hurled and his spear 's long shadow flew but seeing it coming glorious hector ducked away , crouching down , watching the bronze tip fly past and stab the earth — but athena snatched it up and passed it back to achilles and hector the gallant captain never saw her
unlucky man , you must behold the agonizing burial of your son
here ’ s one who bartered his native land for gold , he saddled her with a tyrant , set up laws for a bribe , for a bribe he struck them down
a great joy to the trojans , massing packs of them swarming round the corpse but achaean forces never slacked their drive , their juggernaut fury bore them breakneck on
and any god i caught i would seize and send him plunging over the ramparts , headfirst till he hit the earth , barely alive
don ’ t hold me back
soon as the giant gained deep water and offshore swells , he washed the blood still trickling down from his dug-out socket , gnashing his teeth , groaning , and wades out in the surf but the breakers still can ’ t douse his soaring thighs
you ’ ll never see me disgraced again—no more
dido burns with love—the tragic queen
as ilioneus ends his appeal , latinus keeps on looking down at the ground , stock-still , only his eyes moving , rapt in concentration
cringe with shame at the thought they will strip his gear and maim his corpse — these myrmidons , seething for all the argive troops we killed , we speared to death against their fast trim ships !
i live on the meager fare the branches offer , berries and cornel nuts as hard as rocks , and feed on roots i tear from the earth
so dido , doomed , was lengthening out the night by trading tales as she drank long draughts of love—asking aeneas question on question , now about priam , now hector , what armor memnon , son of the morning , wore at troy , how swift were the horses of diomedes ?
young pallas , whom turnus had overpowered , taken down with a wound , and now his shoulder flaunted his enemy ’ s battle-emblem like a trophy
but the two aeantes blazing in battle-fury saw to imbrius now
it does you proud to stand by me , my friend , to attack the man who attacks me — be king on a par with me , take half my honors !
better times may come to those in pain
but zeus could never think of ruin without a groan whenever he saw heracles , his own dear son endure some shameful labor eurystheus forced upon him
only three summers will see him govern latium , three winters pass in barracks after the latins have been broken
and ilus , in turn , sired a valiant son laomedon , laomedon had his sons as well , tithonus and priam , lampus and clytius , hicetaon the gallant aide of ares
his heart 's so game , his fighting edge so keen , the best of us all in every combat mission — athena loves the man
i had to spare my teams
a city is what they pray for
once you have passed them all , moored your ships on the far shore and set up altars on the beach to perform your vows , then cloak yourselves in purple , veil your heads , so while the hallowed fires are burning in honor of the gods , no enemy presence can break in and disrupt the omens
never flustered , the cool-headed meriones took his point : idomeneus , captain of cretans under arms , i have come for a spear to fight with , if you still have one left inside your tents
but aphrodite rounded on her in fury : do not provoke me — wretched , headstrong girl !
you have stopped my fighting against the trojans , true , but i tell you here and now that a dark , bloody doom will take you down today — gouged by my spear you will give me glory now , you will give your life to the famous horseman death !
your own good team ?
where are they sleeping ?
achilles next — he hurled his spear and its long shadow flew and the weapon struck the balanced round shield of aeneas under the outer rim where the bronze ran thinnest , backed by the thinnest bull's-hide
the troops themselves had no fear , no dread of the trojans ' power and breakneck charges , no , they stood their ground like heavy thunderheads stacked up on the towering mountaintops by cronus ' son , stock-still in a windless calm when the raging north wind and his gusty ripping friends that had screamed down to rout dark clouds have fallen dead asleep
then down the entire shore they watch their comrades burn as men stand guard at the pyres now dying out
aphrodite the daughter of zeus replied at once , hera , queen of the skies , daughter of mighty cronus , tell me what 's on your mind
so these two brothers , laid low by the two brothers , dropped to the world of night : sarpedon 's stalwart cohorts , spearmen sons of amisodarus — he who bred the chimaera , the grim monster that sent so many men to death
he surged along the achaean ships and shelters , spurring argives , piling griefs on trojans
the trophies lie afield — they await the charioteers
but aeneas , duty-bound , his mind restless with worries all that night , reached a firm resolve as the fresh day broke
your hopes soar , i suppose , to gut and crush our ships ?
their prayers rose and pallas athena heard them
some press hard for an entry , scaling the walls with ladders , wherever a gap shows in the thin defensive ring and light breaks through
euryalus killed dresus , killed opheltius , turned and went for pedasus and aesepus , twins the nymph of the spring abarbarea bore bucolion
but two i can not find , and they are captains of the armies , castor breaker of horses and the hardy boxer polydeuces
the old men bent with age , the women sick of the sea , ones who are feeble , ones who shrink from danger : set them apart , and exhausted as they are , let them have their walls within this land
what work for the gods who live on high , what a concern to ruffle their repose !
but still , ravishing as she is , let her go home in the long ships and not be left behind
so many chosen captains heading thirty warships , speeding to rescue troy , cleft the fields of salt with beaks of bronze
that moment the lines of fighters buckle , latins , routed , sling their shields on their backs and wheel their horses round to the walls as the trojans drive them on with asilas in the lead , his squadrons charging
venus ’ son will be the same—a paris reborn , a funeral torch to consume a second troy !
just set my daughter free , my dear one
nor will italy once regret embracing troy in her heart
but he could not dodge the lightning mind of zeus — standing guard over hector zeus tore the glory right from teucer 's grasp , he snapped the twisted cord on his handsome bow just as the archer drew it taut against his man and the weighted bronze shaft skittered off to the side , the bow dropped from his hand and teucer shuddered , calling out to his brother , oh what luck — look , some power cuts us out of the fighting , foils our plans !
you cruel , heartless—even if you were not pursuing alien fields and unknown homes , even if ancient troy were standing , still , who ’ d sail for troy across such heaving seas ?
if i leave this splendid gear and desert patroclus — who fell here fighting , all to redeem my honor — wo not any comrade curse me , seeing me break away ?
too fast for them , here was a ring of trojan chiefs : aeneas , polydamas and the royal prince agenor , sarpedon the lycians ' captain , valiant glaucus — and all their troops spared nothing , pitching in , bracing their thick bulging shields to cover hector
those words re-echoing from her shrine , the cumaean sibyl chants her riddling visions filled with dread , her cave resounds as she shrouds the truth in darkness—phoebus whips her on in all her frenzy , twisting his spurs below her breast
yes , latin and trojan blood will be your dowry , princess— bellona , goddess of war , your maid-of-honor !
he yearns to be gone , to desert this land he loves , thunderstruck by the warnings , jupiter ’ s command
first , the sky and the earth and the flowing fields of the sea , the shining orb of the moon and the titan sun , the stars : an inner spirit feeds them , coursing through all their limbs , mind stirs the mass and their fusion brings the world to birth
my own mind 's made up to give you back your son
then no delay , tarchon joins forces at once and seals a pact
next aeneas sees troilus in flight , his weapons flung aside , unlucky boy , no match for achilles ’ onslaught— horses haul him on , tangled behind an empty war-car , flat on his back , clinging still to the reins , his neck and hair dragging along the ground , the butt of his javelin scrawling zigzags in the dust
but fetch me another prize , and straight off too , else i alone of the argives go without my honor
and seeing him gleam in armor , puffed with pride , why running away ?
jupiter rises up from his golden throne as the gods of heaven flock around him there and escort him to the gateway of his mansion
as his racing spirit veered back and forth , just as he drew his huge blade from its sheath , down from the vaulting heavens swept athena , the white-armed goddess hera sped her down : hera loved both men and cared for both alike
now nearing the finish , that left one , cloanthus— mnestheus goes for him all-out , urging his crews to give it all they ’ ve got
the same honors await you , one and all
who has not heard of aeneas ’ people , his city , troy , her men , her heroes , the flames of that horrendous war ?
rumor flies , and the hearts of latian mothers flare up with the same fury , the same frenzy spurs them to seek new homes
i am on my way over there to meet this new assault — i will soon be back , once i have given them clear commands
you must bear up now
kneading her skin with this to a soft glow and combing her hair , she twisted her braids with expert hands , and sleek , luxurious , shining down from her deathless head they fell , cascading
hector — whipping the fight and fire in each man like a huntsman crying on his hounds , their white fangs flashing , harrying savage game , some wild boar or lion — so at achaea 's ranks he drove his fearless trojans , hector son of priam , a match for murderous ares
my glittering war-belt stopped the shot in front , my loin-piece and the plated guard below it , gear the bronzesmiths hammered out for me
here ’ s murranus sounding off the names of his forebears , all his fathers ’ fathers ’ line from the start of time , his entire race come down from the latin kings
bring on the sacred rites , father , draft our binding terms
it must be his own great rage that drives him on — he pitied the sight of argives pinned against their ships
the goddess threw her snow-white arms around him as he held back , caressing him here and there , and suddenly he caught fire—the same old story , the flame he knew by heart went running through him , melting him to the marrow of his bones
this armor he gives mnestheus , a fighter ’ s badge of honor to shield him well in war
— trojans stormed over the rampart , lashing their teams to fight against the ships , hurling their two-edged spears at close range there , trojans from lurching cars but achaeans from high decks , scrambling aloft black hulls , lunged down with the long pikes — jointed and clinched and tipped with ripping bronze — they would kept on board for bloody fights at sea
you would think they waded into the fighting , fresh troops , unbruised , unbroken , they fought with such new fire
the rest of you : down you go , go to trojans , go to achaeans
and the men who settled argissa and gyrtone , orthe , elone , the gleaming citadel oloosson : polypoetes braced for battle led them on , the son of pirithous , son of deathless zeus
messapus levels clonius , then lycaon ’ s son , erichaetes , one thrown from a reinless horse and sprawled aground , the other fighting on foot
still , head to foot a greek , a man once sent to troy equipped with his country ’ s arms
there 's an old tale i remember , an ancient exploit , nothing recent , but this is how it went
doomed to live forever ?
but dido , trembling , desperate now with the monstrous thing afoot— her bloodshot eyes rolling , quivering cheeks blotched and pale with imminent death—goes bursting through the doors to the inner courtyard , clambers in frenzy up the soaring pyre and unsheathes a sword , a trojan sword she once sought as a gift , but not for such an end
at the giant 's command the earth ran red with blood , slithering dark now and the soldiers ' corpses tumbling thick-and-fast , trojans and breakneck allies piled alongside argives — how could the argives fight without some bloody losses ?
lionhearted ajax and menelaus were not blind
reaching out his arms , again and again he prayed to his dear mother : mother !
never right , is it , for a common man to speak against you , king , never in open council , and god forbid in war
how he would whine to the high skies — till father zeus would rush me down from the clouds to save his life
chilling tremors shook the trojans ' knees , down to the last man , terrified at the sight : the headlong runner coming , gleaming in all his gear , afire like man-destroying ares
but atreus ' son the fighting menelaus marked it all — the trojans killing patroclus there in the brutal carnage — and crested now in his gleaming bronze gear atrides plowed through the front to stand astride the body , braced like a mother cow lowing over a calf , her first-born , first labor-pangs she would felt
hippodamas next , he leapt from his chariot fleeing before achilles — achilles ' spearshaft rammed him through the back and he gasped his life away , bellowing like some bull that chokes and grunts when the young boys drag him round the lord of helice 's shrine and the earthquake god delights to see them dragging — so he bellowed now and the man 's proud spirit left his bones behind
hector waiting , watching the greathearted patroclus trying to stagger free , seeing him wounded there with the sharp bronze came rushing into him right across the lines and rammed his spearshaft home , stabbing deep in the bowels , and the brazen point went jutting straight out through patroclus ' back
and iris riding the wind obeyed his orders , swooping down from ida 's peaks to sacred troy
he will gladly sink to a knee and rest , i would say , if the man comes through alive from the fight he begs for , dueling to the death
tell me , be precise about it — how many days do you need to bury prince hector ?
book eight : the tide of battle turns
the dead of night , and weary living creatures throughout the world are enjoying peaceful sleep
and immortal sea-nymphs gathered round their sister , all the nereids dwelling down the sounding depths , they all came rushing now — glitter , blossoming spray and the swells ' embrace , fair-isle and shadowy cavern , mist and spindrift , ocean nymphs of the glances pooling deep and dark , race-with-the-waves and headlands ' hope and safe haven , glimmer of honey , suave-and-soothing , whirlpool , brilliance , bounty and first light and speeder of ships and buoyant power , welcome home and bather of meadows and master 's lovely consort , gift of the sea , eyes of the world and the famous milk-white calm and truth and never-wrong and the queen who rules the tides in beauty and in rushed glory and healer of men and the one who rescues kings and sparkler , down-from-the-cliffs , sleek-haired strands of sand and all the rest of the nereids dwelling down the depths
but i will declare my inmost feelings to achilles
he 's just assaulted love , he stabbed her wrist — like something superhuman he even charged at me !
he broke up the assembly at once
with good will to the lords he rose and spoke : king agamemnon , chiefs of all the argives — how many long-haired achaeans lie here dead !
the father of men and gods replied sharply , hera — stop hoping to fathom all my thoughts
but phoebus apollo called to blazing ares , ares , ares , destroyer of men , reeking blood , stormer of ramparts , ca not you go and drag that man from the fighting ?
you have your mother 's uncontrollable rage — incorrigible , that hera — say what i will , i can hardly keep her down
i with the same high honors ?
the spearman diomedes served as the man 's second , goading him on , intent to see him win
he cried , i beg you , pity me !
but to spare the loyal trojans such a monstrous fate— risking that harbor , touching those lethal shores— neptune swelled their sails with following winds and gave them a swift escape , speeding them past the churning shoals unharmed
but meriones , taking aim at deiphobus , hurled his flashing spear and struck — no miss !
but if you love hector , if you hold him dear , at least give both men equal strength and glory
but come , while i strap my battle-armor on , all of you pray to cronus ' son , almighty zeus
turning their eyes to face the rising sun , the captains reach out their hands , pouring the salted meal , and mark off the brows of the victims , cutting tufts with iron blades , and tip their cups on the sacred altar fires
we see them standing there , powerless , each with his one glaring eye , their heads towering up , an horrendous muster looming into the vaulting sky like mountain oaks or cypress heavy with cones in jupiter ’ s soaring woods or diana ’ s sacred grove
i tell you this and i will fulfill it too : i will maim their racers for them , right beneath their yokes , and those two goddesses , i will hurl them from their chariot , smash their car , and not once in the course of ten slow wheeling years will they heal the wounds my lightning bolt rips open
why did he grant me life eternal—rob me of our one privilege , death ?
ocnus too , heading an army come from native coasts , a son of manto the seer and the tuscan river tiber
he summons mnestheus , sergestus , staunch serestus , gives them orders : fit out the fleet , but not a word
all were sick of struggling with the sea
at boxing i destroyed clytomedes , enops ' boy
and his loving father laughed , his mother laughed as well , and glorious hector , quickly lifting the helmet from his head , set it down on the ground , fiery in the sunlight , and raising his son he kissed him , tossed him in his arms , lifting a prayer to zeus and the other deathless gods : zeus , all you immortals !
so come , friends , do as i say — all take my lead
amphimachus and nastes led their formations on , nastes and amphimachus , nomion 's flamboyant sons
allecto—a joy to her heart , the griefs of war , rage , and murderous plots , and grisly crimes
under his auspices , watch , my son , our brilliant rome will extend her empire far and wide as the earth , her spirit high as olympus
come , prince , if you have the spine , if you have any spark of your fathers ’ warring spirit , look , your challenger calls you out to fight !
so idomeneus , famous spearman , stood his ground , he never gave an inch with aeneas charging in , quick to the rescue
and now as the armies clashed at one strategic point they slammed their shields together , pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields ' bosses pounded hide-to-hide and the thunder of struggle roared and rocked the earth
would he sanction the mingling of their peoples , bless their binding pacts ?
down deep they harden fast—they must , so long engrained in the flesh—in strange , uncanny ways
and the dead lord patroclus had fed nine dogs at table — he slit the throats of two , threw them onto the pyre and then a dozen brave sons of the proud trojans he hacked to pieces with his bronze
and once the god has led you within the fighter 's shelter , achilles will not kill you — he will hold back all the rest : achilles is no madman , no reckless fool , not the one to defy the gods ' commands
so pleased , are they , with all the help , the relief i lent them once ?
quickly , set before her stranger 's generous fare while i put away my bellows and all my tools
he himself , aflame in outlandish reds and purples , shot gortynian shafts from a lycian bow , a bow of gold slung from the priest ’ s shoulders , gold his helmet too , and he ’ d knotted his saffron cape and flaring linen pleats with a tawny golden brooch , his shirt and barbarous leggings stiff with needled braid
now out they go , crossing the trench and threading through the dark , heading toward the enemy camp , destined to die but make a bloodbath first
so with telamon 's son great ajax then — vaunting trojans and all their far-flung allies kept on stabbing his shield , full center , no letup
i would even urge you to fault him any other day
a flash of his helmet as hector shot back , impossible man !
night and day the gates of shadowy death stand open wide , but to retrace your steps , to climb back to the upper air— there the struggle , there the labor lies
but hector dear to zeus had no idea , hector heard nothing of how his men , left of the ships , were torn and mauled in the argives ' rough response
but first send pallas home to evander ’ s grieving city , a soldier who never lost heart when the black day swept him off and drowned him in bitter death
but odysseus — why , he 's out of the dark ages , one of the old relics — but in green old age , they say
and still i could never swear he 's not a god
many who battle round king priam 's mighty walls are sons of the deathless gods — you will inspire lethal anger in them all
we were all busy then , milling round a spring and offering victims up on the holy altars , full sacrifice to the gods to guarantee success , under a spreading plane tree where the water splashed , glittering in the sun — when a great omen appeared
and once offshore of achaea 's vast encampment they eased her in and hauled the black ship high , far up on the sand , and shored her up with timbers
but whenever i would set my mind to drag you up , in deadly earnest , i would hoist you all with ease , you and the earth , you and the sea , all together , then loop that golden cable round a horn of olympus , bind it fast and leave the whole world dangling in mid-air — that is how far i tower over the gods , i tower over men
the spirit inside you overpowered by anger !
surely we ’ ll carry back to our walls these words of yours with grateful hearts , and if fortune points the way , ally you with our king , latinus
here ’ s hyllus rushing in with his bloodcurdling rage but turnus rushing to block him whips a spear at his brow that splits his gilded helmet , sticks erect in his brain
nothing i said was meant in earnest — trust me , i mean you all the good will in the world
such was the fate of priam , his death , his lot on earth , with troy blazing before his eyes , her ramparts down , the monarch who once had ruled in all his glory the many lands of asia , asia ’ s many tribes
clear on the right a bird winged past to seal those words , a soaring eagle swooping
like ghosts that after our death , they say , will flutter on or dreams that deceive our senses lost in sleep
just think what the gods would have heard if we had come to blows , even those beneath the ground who circle cronus
now , quick , i will marshal our battle-hungry argives — face the rest of the trojans , test them , fight them down !
and orpheus himself , the thracian priest with his long robes , keeps their rhythm strong with his lyre ’ s seven ringing strings , plucking now with his fingers , now with his ivory plectrum
but the day of death already hovers near , and we are not to blame but a great god is and the strong force of fate
follow me in , please , let me offer you all a guest could want
the piled offerings blazed , frankincense , hallowed foods and brimming bowls of oil
the king of lofty olympus won ’ t allow it
achilles despised him most , odysseus too — he was always abusing both chiefs , but now he went for majestic agamemnon , hollering out , taunting the king with strings of cutting insults
think how promachus sleeps at your feet now , beaten down by my spear — with no long wait to pay the price for my brother dead and gone
a rout of them strewed their sacred staves on the ground , raked with a cattle prod by lycurgus , murderous fool !
sarpedon marshaled the famous allies , placing glaucus next in command with the combat veteran asteropaeus , head and shoulders the best men , sarpedon thought , after himself of course : he outshone the rest
a gift to the gods ?
now he has come to hate the generation of priam , and now aeneas will rule the men of troy in power — his sons ' sons and the sons born in future years
starved for war , aeneas had cased his calves in gold , left and right , and spurning delay , he shakes his glinting spear
i am the flowing river that you see , sweeping the banks and cutting across the tilled fields rich and green
on foot a lycian too , one agis strode up now but valerus , no poor heir to his fathers ’ battle prowess , hurled him down as thronius fell to salius , salius to nealces , crack marksman with spears and arrows both , blindsiding in front afar
in elephenor 's command sailed forty long black ships
and the cause of this , this new trojan grief ?
seeing paris , hector raked his brother with insults , stinging taunts : what on earth are you doing ?
whom to trust to besiege the embattled walls ?
suddenly reaching the open sea in gale force , whipping whitecaps under a shrilling killer-squall they raised the good rich soil of troy and struck the pyre and a huge inhuman blaze went howling up the skies
achaeans armed in bronze will thrill to his call , they will put up a man to battle shining hector
none of his trappings kept off grisly death — down he went , crushed by racing achilles ' hands , destroyed at the ford where battle-hard achilles stripped his gold away
the gods in the halls of jove are filled with pity , feeling the futile rage of both great armies , mourning the labors borne by mortal men
she set the man ablaze , his shield and helmet flaming with tireless fire like the star that flames at harvest , bathed in the ocean , rising up to outshine all other stars
with that he rushes euryalus , sword drawn as nisus terrified , frenzied—no more hiding in shadows , no enduring such anguish any longer—he breaks out : me—here i am , i did it !
hera queen of the gods , daughter of giant cronus , launched the work , harnessed the golden-bridled team and hebe quickly rolled the wheels to the chariot , paired wheels with their eight spokes all bronze , and bolted them on at both ends of the iron axle
they would call out , scanning the wide sky , father zeus — ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , glory !
so there he rose and loosed an enormous cry and off in the distance pallas shrieked out too and drove unearthly panic through the trojans
so now no shield , no sword-arm helps the fighter stand up under the onslaught , overpowering salvos battering down on him left and right
the men hung on his words and they obeyed at once
they cried in alarm and charged toward the ships and the dust went whirling up from under rushing feet as the men jostled back and forth , shouting orders — grapple the ships !
defending their city walls , they all burn to be the first to die
once more he springs from arpi , that aetolian , diomedes
it 's wrong to have such an iron , ruthless heart
up they rose and strapped on armor and swung aboard the war-cars , drivers , fighters beside them — and the horse moved out in front , behind came clouds of infantry , men by thousands , and in their midst his comrades bore patroclus
why , i could promise to give back helen , yes , and all her treasures with her , all those riches paris once hauled home to troy in the hollow ships — and they were the cause of all our endless fighting — yes , yes , return it all to the sons of atreus now to haul away , and then , at the same time , divide the rest with all the argives , all the city holds , and then i would take an oath for the trojan royal council that we will hide nothing !
a dozen picked men could barely shoulder it up , men of such physique as the earth brings forth these days , but he wrenched it up , hands trembling , tried to heave it right at aeneas , turnus stretching to full height , the hero at speed , at peak strength
spears at the ready !
pity me in my pain
and ares bellowed his cry from far across the lines , churning black as a whirlwind , roaring down now from the city 's crest , commanding trojans on and now rushing along the simois banks and scaling sunlight hill
the mares of eumelus must have come to grief , somewhere downfield — they led on the way out
both let fly at each other , one launching out with a sharp lance , one a shaft from the string — and helenus ' arrow hit atrides right on the chest , on the breastplate 's curve but the arrow sprang away
no such pact did lausus seal between you and me that you would spare my life
enough that numanus fell to your flying shafts and you ’ ve not paid a price
all the troops were dumbstruck , all but the trojan hero—well he knew that sound , his goddess mother ’ s promise—and he calls out : don ’ t ask , my friend , don ’ t ask me , i beg you , what these portents bring
and all the while aeneas lands his men by planks from the high sterns
there dardanus was born , there iasius
but over his body the goddess raised a terrific din , a war for the prize , the huge beast 's head and shaggy hide — curetes locked to the death with brave aetolians
athena 's heart leapt high , she charged at aphrodite , overtook her and beat her breasts with clenched fists
that seems best to me
for neighboring people living in cities near and far , compelled by signs from the great gods on high , will appease your bones , will build you a tomb and pay your tomb due rites and the site will bear the name of palinurus now and always
so on they fought like a mass of swirling fire as neleus ' foaming mares bore nestor clear of battle and bore machaon the expert healer too
and what 's more , i can see through you , priam — no hiding the fact from me : one of the gods has led you down to achaea 's fast ships
there they settled , conferring among themselves till the noble horseman opened with his plan : my friends , is not there one man among us here , so sure of himself , his soldier 's nerve and pluck , he would infiltrate these overreaching trojans ?
far off as he is , you will set him up in glory
some heat water in cauldrons fired to boiling , bathe and anoint the body chill with death
and now — one warrior harnessed burnished armor on his back , magnificent paris , fair-haired helen 's consort
hard as the autumn north wind hits a leveled field just drenched in a downpour , quickly dries it off and the farmer is glad and starts to till his soil — so the whole plain was parched and the god of fire devoured all the dead , then blazing in all his glory veered for the river — an inferno — the elms burned , the willows and tamarisks burned and the lotus burned and the galingale and reeds and rushes , all that flourished along the running river 's lush banks and the eels writhed and fish in the whirlpools leapt high , breaking the surface left and right in a sheen of fire , gasping under the master smith hephaestus ' blast and now the river 's strength was burning out , he panted the god 's name : hephaestus — stop !
no , deep in my spirit i have known them all , i ’ ve faced them all before
and men who settled tricca , rocky ithome terraced high and men who held oechalia , oechalian eurytus ' city : the two sons of asclepius led their units now , both skilled healers , podalirius and machaon
the next moment a cry hits his ears , and look , euryalus !
but menestheus could not reach them with a shout — the din was deafening , war cries hitting the skies , spears battering shields and helmets ' horsehair crests and the huge gates all bolted shut , but against them there the trojans tensed and heaved , trying to smash them down and force a passage through
achilles pointed out the post
but all the rest , once they have turned the wheel of time for a thousand years : god calls them forth to the lethe , great armies of souls , their memories blank so that they may revisit the overarching world once more and begin to long to return to bodies yet again
no one can rout me — his will against my will — not by force , god knows , and not by a sly maneuver either
forced by wanderings , storm-tossed at sea , or prompted by the gods ?
but you , i round on you with all my heart
why come back here to shore ?
no baby boy still in his mother 's belly , not even he escape — all ilium blotted out , no tears for their lives , no markers for their graves !
no mean feat to beat him out in a race , for all but our achilles
here the good commander aeneas staked an ilex , leaves and all , as a turning-post where crews would know to wheel their ships around and begin the long pull home
scanning every opening , tossing his head , this way , that way , grinding his teeth , blazing in rage , three times he circles the whole aventine hill , three times he tries to storm the rocky gates—no use— three times he sinks down in the lowlands , power spent
and now as they filed among the mustered guard they found the chief sentries far from sleep — on the alert , all stationed set with weapons
but now it was agamemnon lord of the far-flung kingdoms catching up with isus — he stabbed his chest with a spear above the nipple , antiphus he hacked with a sword across the ear and hurled him from his chariot , rushing fast to rip the splendid armor off their bodies
they will look left and right — where can they run ?
the gods take seats in the mansion , entering there through doors to east and west , and jove starts in : you great gods of the sky , why have you turned against your own resolve ?
now his father was backing off , defenseless , weighed down , dragging his enemy ’ s spearshaft trailing from his shield , so the son sprang forward , darting into the moil and just as aeneas rose up , his arm reared for attack , lausus , ducking under the stroke , parried the sword , holding the trojan off while shouting comrades harried aeneas with missiles pelting in from afar till under his son ’ s shield the father could escape
once he gained his side hector raked his brother with insults , stinging taunts : paris , appalling paris !
don ’ t you recall whose lands you settled here , the men who press around you ?
he kept them fixed on the struggling mass forever , the father 's spirit churning , thrashing out the ways , the numberless ways to cause patroclus ' slaughter
i have no mind to sit it out in the shelters — what i love is battle !
there they lit their fires , each man made his meal
look at his hand clasp , look at his good faith now— that man who , they say , carries his fathers ’ gods , who stooped to shoulder his father bent with age !
oh i think he will have his troubles to shoulder , plenty of them too , if achilles ever turns away from the heartbreaking anger deep inside him
he obeyed the order , turning , trailing away in silence down the shore where the battle lines of breakers crash and drag
i go to his side — nothing i do can help him
the nurse bustled off with an old crone ’ s zeal
no , my sons , never inure yourselves to civil war , never turn your sturdy power against your country ’ s heart
backing , helmet flashing , his strong hand hefting a rock from the field , dark , jagged , a ton weight — he hurled it at ajax , struck the gigantic shield , seven oxhides thick , struck right on the jutting boss and the bronze clanged , echoing round and round as ajax hoisting a boulder — far larger — wheeled and heaved it , putting his weight behind it , tremendous force — and the rock crashed home , hector 's shield burst in , hit by a millstone — and hector 's fine knees buckled , flat on his back he went , his shield crushing down on him swept him off his feet
this is the last word that fate allows me to say to you
not i , i will never go back again
now , again , you divine god 's will for the armies , bruit it about , as fact , why the deadly archer multiplies our pains : because i , i refused that glittering price for the young girl chryseis
and his good wife will tear her cheeks in grief , his sons are orphans and he , soaking the soil red with his own blood , he rots away himself — more birds than women flocking round his body !
we have brought magnificent hector down , that man the trojans glorified in their city like a god !
you ’ ll return from the front no less than aeneas in numbers killed and battle honors won !
and now the queen , whose trust lay all in you , she ’ s dead by her own hand , terrified , she ’ s fled the light of life
go traipsing over the ridge of dindyma , catch the songs on the double pipe you dote on so !
true , lord apollo killed the sons with his silver bow and artemis showering arrows killed the daughters
what , father , can we suppose that any spirits rise from here to the world above , return once more to the shackles of the body ?
then athena , child of zeus whose shield is thunder , letting fall her supple robe at the father 's threshold — rich brocade , stitched with her own hands ' labor — donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning , buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war and over her shoulders slung her shield , all tassels flaring terror — panic mounted high in a crown around it
go back to your own rank and file , i tell you !
struggling for breath , hector , his helmet flashing , said , i beg you , beg you by your life , your parents — do not let the dogs devour me by the argive ships !
soothing sleep went rushing off to the ships at once , running a message to poseidon
now there is no one left in the wide realm of troy , no friend to treat me kindly — all the countrymen cringe from me in loathing !
if he gets you in his clutches , sets his eyes on you — that savage , treacherous man — he will show no mercy , no respect for your rights !
they split them apart , lashed the logs to the mules and their hoofs tore up the earth , dragging them down to level ground through dense brush
and who are they who crowd the banks in such a growing throng ?
it glides between her robes and her smooth breasts but she feels nothing , no shudder of coils , senses nothing at all as the viper breathes its fire through the frenzied queen
in an instant quercens , aquiculus striking in armor , tmarus—daredevil heart—and haemon , son of mars , with all their squadrons routed , turn tail and run or throw their lives down right at the gateway ’ s mouth
menelaus just might lead her home again
now they are fighting far away from the city , right by your hollow ships !
what news do you bring ?
there he climbed and there he slept and by his side lay hera the queen , the goddess of the golden throne
so long as rivers run to the sea , so long as shadows travel the mountain slopes and the stars range the skies , your honor , your name , your praise will live forever , whatever lands may call me to their shores
ours all clatter to ground
and none of the men who walk the earth these days could battle with those fighters , none , but they , they took to heart my counsels , marked my words
dragging down from the cliffs along a stony trail some roof-beam or a heavy ship timber , slogging on till they nearly burst their hearts with sweat and labor — so they strained to carry off the corpse
round their hoofs he looped the golden hobbles never broken , never slipped , so there they would stand , stock-still on the spot to wait their lord 's return and off poseidon strode to achaea 's vast encampment
that , i remind you , that among the immortal gods is the strongest , truest sign that i can give
and helen spoke to him now , her soft voice welling up : my dear brother , dear to me , bitch that i am , vicious , scheming — horror to freeze the heart !
no , no , let every last man of them lick his wounds — a memento at home — pierced by arrow or spear as he vaults aboard his decks
no way for him to escape us now , no longer — not even if phoebus the distant deadly archer goes through torments , pleading for hector 's life , groveling over and over before our storming father zeus
even patroclus died , a far , far better man than you
but mnestheus and his crew , fired by their success , can just about win the day because they think they can
you should have feared for your chosen people then
here , what ’ s more , in these two towns , their walls razed to the roots , you can see the relics , monuments of the men of old
spent as i was , you left me here , anchises , best of fathers , plucked from so many perils , all for nothing
thundering zeus has spread his hands above her — her armies have taken heart !
one more thing — take it to heart , i tell you — if part of athena 's plan gives me the honor to kill them both , you check our racers here , you lash them fast to our rails then dash for aeneas ' horses — do not forget — drive them out of the trojan lines and into ours
should aeneas go through scathing dangers all unscathed— aeneas ?
now those very warriors stand at ease , in silence — the fighting 's stopped , they lean against their shields , their long lances stuck in the ground beside them
how short you fall of the fighters sired by zeus in the generations long before us !
that 's what they need , i tell you — all the achaeans — good sound advice , now our enemies , camping hard against the ships , kindle their watchfires round us by the thousands
mixed in with the trojans ?
do not let these trojans mow us down in droves !
— spare my life !
no remedy , no way to cure the damage once it 's done
men will make war and peace
the rite complete at last , their duty to the goddess performed in full , they gained the land of joy , the fresh green fields , the fortunate groves where the blessed make their homes
then he seizes the wand that calls the pallid spirits up from the underworld and ushers others down to the grim dark depths , the wand that lends us sleep or sends it away , that unseals our eyes in death
then promise to sacrifice twelve heifers in her shrine , yearlings never broken , if only she will pity troy , the trojan wives and all our helpless children , if only she will hold diomedes back from the holy city — that wild spearman , that invincible headlong terror !
how many shields and helmets and corpses of the brave you ’ ll churn beneath your tides , old father tiber !
a moment ago they longed to kill each other , longed for heartbreaking , inhuman warfare on the plain
but here my comrades left me , forgot me—this monstrous cave of the cyclops—fleeing in terror from its brutal mouth
zeus went back to his own halls , and all the gods in full assembly rose from their seats at once to meet the father striding toward them now
cacus retches up from his throat dense fumes—unearthly , i tell you—endless waves billowing through his lair , wiping all from sight , and deep into his cave he spews out tides of rolling , smoking darkness , night and fire fused
do not you recall the time you drove tydides ' son to spear me through ?
you and your eternal suspicions — i can never escape you
as the latian columns charge them , charging them come agyllines and trojans streaming up with arcadian ranks decked out in blazoned gear and one lust drives them all : to let the sword decide
and seizing the spearshaft powerful agamemnon dragged it toward him , tussling like some lion and wrenching it free from iphidamas ' slack grasp he hacked his neck with a sword and loosed his limbs
pity your father , bent with years and grief , cut off from you in your native city ardea far away
so certain , are you , the sons of achaea are cowards , poor soldiers , just because you say so ?
by chance , one chloreus , sacred to goddess cybebe , once her priest—camilla spied him at long range , gleaming in phrygian gear , spurring a lathered warhorse decked with coat of mail , its brazen scales meshing with gold like feathers stitched
these are the solemn honors owed the dead
he will fight again — in his own good time — whenever the courage in him flares and a god fires his blood
while the trojans tore the war-gear off the bodies argives clambered back in a tangled mass , scrambling back through the sharp stakes and deep pit of the trench , fleeing left and right , forced inside the rampart
how lucky they are , aeneas cries , gazing up at the city ’ s heights , their walls are rising now !
but now , patroclus , since i will follow you underneath the ground , i shall not bury you , no , not till i drag back here the gear and head of hector , who slaughtered you , my friend , greathearted friend
and i made you what you are — strong as the gods , achilles — i loved you from the heart
i was just a baby when father left me then , that time an achaean army went to die at thebes
mother 's gone as well
these trojans who borrow courage , build their trust on the walls they raise , the ditch they dig between us— what a flimsy buffer to shield them all from slaughter !
if that man takes my life with his sharp bronze blade , he will strip my gear and haul it back to his ships
this one has no steadiness in his spirit , not now , he never will
so they had hauled their vessels inland , row on row , while the whole shoreline filled and the bay 's gaping mouth enclosed by the jaws of the two jutting headlands
why , ares , i gather , has just received his share
daughter of storming zeus , tireless one , athena — how hollow our vow to menelaus that he would sack the mighty walls of troy before he sailed for home — if we let murderous ares rampage on this way
but once the two passed down through crowded streets and out into open country , priam 's kin turned back , his sons and in-laws straggling home to troy
whatever dangers await you in that one skirmish , turnus , await me too
but once the envoys reached atrides ' shelters , comrades leapt to their feet , welcomed them back and clustering round them , lifted golden cups
shall i pluck him up , now , while he 's still alive and set him down in the rich green land of lycia , far from the war at troy and all its tears ?
they butchered plenty of fat sheep , banquet fare , and shambling crook-horned cattle , droves of pigs , succulent , rich with fat — they singed the bristles , splaying the porkers out across hephaestus ' fire , then wine from the old man 's jars , all we could drink
now what god can unfold for me so many terrors ?
once allecto saw her first arrows of madness piercing home and latinus ’ plans and his whole house overwhelmed , the grim goddess takes flight on her black wings and heads straight for the walls of bold rutulian turnus
in calm weather , up from the gentle swells it lifts a quiet , level face , a favorite haunt of cormorants basking in the sun
three times the brilliant achilles gave his great war cry over the trench , three times the trojans and famous allies whirled in panic — and twelve of their finest fighters died then and there , crushed by chariots , impaled on their own spears
they have as many hands and lives as we
with that , her mind went veering back and forth— what was the quickest way to break off from the light , the life she loathed ?
or if fortune , up to her old tricks , denies me rites , pay them when i am gone and honor me with a hollow tomb
she says no more and now as the queen falls silent , pallor sweeps her face
a mixing-bowl , richly engraved , the proud trophy that thracian cisseus one day gave my father
there they wept no less , finding rhamnes bled white and so many captains killed in one great slaughter
but oileus ' son , quick ajax killed the most — no one alive could run men down in flight like him once zeus whipped enemy ranks in blinding , panic rout
some flex their limbs in the grassy wrestling-rings , contending in sport , they grapple on the golden sands
the god of the quakes who grips and pounds the earth has just this moment plunged in his own bright sea , diving away from all my mounting anger
i ca not be sure — to spy on our ships or loot the fallen , one of the fighters ' corpses ?
gauls swarming the thickets , about to seize the fortress , shielded by shadows , gift of the pitch-dark night
out of my wits , i seize my arms—what reason for arms ?
he hurled his spear and whizzing in from a distance , winging on , it ricocheted off aeneas ’ shield to hit that hardy fighter antores , yards away , between the flank and groin : antores sent from argos , hercules ’ aide who bound himself to evander , settling down in the king ’ s italian city
this was the first day of her death , the first of grief , the cause of it all
what humiliation — if hector with that flashing helmet takes our ships !
her voice broke but the old king , lost in wonder , cried out , how lucky you are , son of atreus , child of fortune , your destiny so blessed !
others are digging trenches before the gates , hauling up on their shoulders stones and pikes
discipline fill your hearts , maintain your pride in the eyes of other men !
while look at you , wheeling your chariot round the abandoned grassy fields !
but there is no earthly need to fill these halls with the talk that flies so bravely from your mouth , safe as you are while the ramparts keep the enemy out and the trenches still don ’ t overflow with blood
no , time and again his mother thetis told him this was not to be , she told him alone , in secret
all dwell in the heavens , all command the heights
not once have my eyes closed shut beneath my lids from the day my son went down beneath your hands
our fight 's unfought , untested — we will see who stands his ground , who cuts and runs
but come — let 's go to bed , let 's lose ourselves in love !
she ’ s fleshed the war in blood , inaugurated the slaughter with a kill and now she leaves hesperia , wheeling round in the heavens to report success to juno—the fury ’ s voice triumphant : look , i ’ ve done your bidding , perfected a work of strife with ghastly war !
before he could say the last , the two raced in , leapt to the ground and comrades hugged them warmly , with handclasps all around and words of welcome
whatever fortune sends , we master it all by bearing it all , we must !
he sails the massive triton , her sea-horn making the blue deep quake , and as she runs on her prow displays a shaggy man to the waist , all dragon to the tail and under the monster ’ s breast , part man , part beast , the foaming swells resound
but the pyre of dead patroclus was not burning — and the swift runner achilles thought of what to do
now he will make more slaughter , well i know
my friend , remember your father 's last commands ?
you ’ ve done good work
so come , follow my orders
seven women i will give him , flawless , skilled in crafts , women of lesbos — the ones i chose , my privilege , that day he captured the lesbos citadel himself : they outclassed the tribes of women in their beauty
my father-in-law latinus will retain his armies , my father-in-law , his power , his rightful rule
and the men who lived around percote and practios , men who settled sestos , abydos and gleaming arisbe : asius son of hyrtacus led them on , captain of armies , hyrtacus ' offspring asius — hulking , fiery stallions bore him in from arisbe , from the selleis river
then dipping up the wine from the mixing bowls , brimming their cups , pouring them on the earth , men said their prayers to the gods who never die
now i think you will cringe at the hint of war if you get wind of battle far away
for a destiny so great , great walls you must erect and never shrink from the long labor of exile , no , you must leave this home
fool , what short-lived memory you must have !
there 's not a man alive who can fight the will of zeus , even a man of iron — zeus is so much stronger !
but on the armies came as if the whole earth were devoured by wildfire , yes , and the ground thundered under them , deep as it does for zeus who loves the lightning , zeus in all his rage when he lashes the ground around typhoeus in arima , there where they say the monster makes his bed of pain — so the earth thundered under their feet , armies trampling , sweeping through the plain at blazing speed
since it is not allowed that latins and trojans join in pacts of peace , and there is no end to your eternal clashes—now , whatever the luck of each man today , and whatever hope he follows , trojan or italian , i make no choice between them
a slash of a sword—thymbraeus finished giant osiris , mnestheus kills arcetius , achates hacks epulo down and gyas , ufens
bacchus , giver of bliss , and juno , generous juno , bless us now
long as our realm still stood , andromache , poor woman , would often go this way , unattended , to hector ’ s parents , taking the boy astyanax by the hand to see grandfather priam
i never met the man myself , never saw him , but they say he had no equal
they herded cattle out of the city , fat sheep too , quickly , brought on rations of honeyed , mellow wine and bread from the halls , heaped the firewood high and up from the plain the winds swept the smoke , the sweetness and the savor swirling up the skies
the call to action had still not reached their ears and the columns were only just now forming , moving out , stallion-breaking trojans and long lines of achaeans
so come , let us rescue him from death ourselves , for fear the son of cronus might just tower in rage if achilles kills this man
down from the car he would leapt , squaring off , charging in full fury , full face , straight into agamemnon 's spearhead ramming sharp — the rim of the bronze helmet could not hold it , clean through heavy metal and bone the point burst and the brains splattered all inside the casque
nor will juno ever fail to harry the trojan race , and all the while , pleading , pressed by need—what tribes , what towns of italy won ’ t you beg for help !
the men bear spears and grim pikes into battle , fight with sword-blades ground to a razor edge and sabellian hurling spears
when you set out on that deadly mission , couldn ’ t your mother have said some last farewell ?
antilochus struck atymnius hard with a whetted spear , the bronze ripping into his flank and clean through — he crashed at his feet
to all , to latinus , the father of my bride , i , turnus , second in fighting strength to none of the men who came before me—i devote my life
back he strode to his ramparts , back to camp
then , once more , trojan troops would have clambered back inside their walls , whipped weak with fear by the argives primed for battle and they , they would have seized enormous glory — yes , defying even the great decree of zeus — by dint of their own power and striking force
we muster men for crews
and still i lead our lycians into battle
their sister , silvia , trained the stag to take the commands she gave with love , wreathed its horns with tender , fresh-cut garlands , curried the wild creature , bathed it in running springs
the next throw now — long-enduring odysseus ' turn
at last the sun and the wind went down , abandoned us , broken men , our bearings lost
transfixed , the men of troy and sicily froze and prayed the gods on high
they found him beside his lodge and black hull , seated grimly — and achilles took no joy when he saw the two approaching
clearly victory goes to menelaus dear to ares
we cast off cables and let the sheets run free , unfurling sail as a southwind bellies out the canvas
look , who 's that achaean there , so stark and grand ?
whichever contenders trample on this treaty first , spill their brains on the ground as this wine spills — theirs , their children 's too — their enemies rape their wives !
first he lunges at aphrodite , stabs her hand at the wrist then charges me — even me — like something superhuman !
then my trojans could catch their breath again , reprieved from death — they cringed at you like bleating goats before some lion
he ’ d barely worked her free of the ruthless rock with craft and effort , one bank of her oars gone , one in splinters
so anchises urges and all are overjoyed to follow his command
detached from the ranks , two scouts took up their posts , the eyes of the army waiting to spot a convoy , the enemy 's flocks and crook-horned cattle coming
yet the queen delays , lingering in her chamber with carthaginian chiefs expectant at her doors
launch athena against him — the queen of plunder , she 's the one — his match , a marvel at bringing ares down in pain
at once — and pay us reparations fair and fitting , a price to inspire generations still to come !
that said , he drags the old man straight to the altar , quaking , slithering on through slicks of his son ’ s blood , and twisting priam ’ s hair in his left hand , his right hand sweeping forth his sword— a flash of steel—he buries it hilt-deep in the king ’ s flank
so when the maids had bathed and anointed the body sleek with olive oil and wrapped it round and round in a braided battle-shirt and handsome battle-cape , then achilles lifted hector up in his own arms and laid him down on a bier , and comrades helped him raise the bier and body onto the sturdy wagon
just at dawn she knelt down beside you and grasped your knees and i suspect you bowed your head in assent to her — you granted once and for all to exalt achilles now and slaughter hordes of achaeans pinned against their ships
no way to parley with that man — not now — not from behind some oak or rock to whisper , like a boy and a young girl , lovers ' secrets a boy and girl might whisper to each other
if that curse of the earth must reach his haven , labor on to landfall— if jove and the fates command and the boundary stone is fixed , still , let him be plagued in war by a nation proud in arms , torn from his borders , wrenched from iulus ’ embrace , let him grovel for help and watch his people die a shameful death !
i ’ d little joy , believe me , when hercules came and i sailed the hero over , or theseus , pirithous , sons of gods as they were with their high and mighty power
oh old friend , surely your father peleus urged you , that day he sent you out of phthia to agamemnon , amy son , victory is what athena and hera will give , if they so choose
what other achaean driver could match your skill at curbing this deathless team or spurring on their fury ?
but he does spot three stags roaming the shore , an entire herd behind them grazing down the glens in a long ranked line
soon as the monster gorged himself to bursting , buried deep in wine , his neck slumping to one side , spreading his huge hulk across his cave , dead asleep but retching chunks of flesh and wine awash with filth— we prayed to the great gods , drew lots , rushed in a ring around him there and drilled out with a stabbing spike his one enormous eye , lodged deep in his grisly brow , big as a greek shield or apollo ’ s torch , the sun
and all the while they worked over menelaus whose cry could marshal armies , on the trojans came , columns armed for assault , and again the argives donned their gear and roused their lust for war
the work is mine , imperious juno carried on , but how to begin this pressing matter now and see it through ?
if any prayer can persuade you now , look down on us—that ’ s all i ask—if our devotion has earned it , grant us another omen , father , seal this first clear sign
achilles blazed , charging , raging to cut him down , loosing savage cries — but phoebus whisked him away , easy work for a god , and wrapped him round in mist
and again the olympian father fired up the trojans ramming argives back against their own deep trench
then as tarquitus begs him , struggling to keep on begging , all for nothing , aeneas dashes his head to the ground and rolling the man ’ s warm trunk along and looming over him vaunts with all the hatred in his heart : now lie there , you great , frightful man !
you remember the last time i rushed to your defense ?
that cry — that was hector 's honored mother i heard !
so let your heart be swayed by what i say
me out of all the daughters of the sea he chose to yoke to a mortal man , peleus , son of aeacus , and i endured his bed , a mortal 's bed , resisting with all my will
i ca not take up my spear , ca not hold it steady — no wading into enemy ranks to fight it out
look — now it 's achilles , a greater man he disgraces , seizes and keeps his prize , tears her away himself
but achilles wo not be missed so sorely , not a bit , if the rest of us can rouse and defend each other
he battered oileus down despite the trojan 's rage and the lord of fighters left them lying there , both dead and their chests gleamed like bronze as he stripped them bare
and shouting squads of achaeans raced in for the kill , hoping to drag him off and hurling showers of spears but none could stab or strike the lord of armies now
charging like two hostile bulls fighting up on sila ’ s woods or taburnus ’ ridges , ramping in mortal combat , both brows bent for attack and the herdsmen back away in fear and the whole herd stands by , hushed , afraid , and the heifers wait and wonder , who will lord it over the forest ?
the reason i linger out this life i loathe , aeneas , now pallas is dead and gone , is your right arm that owes , as you well know , the life of turnus to son and father both
like the generations of leaves , the lives of mortal men
his voice like a shock wave , the god of the earthquake spurred the argive fighters on — battalions forming around the two aeantes , full strength , crack battalions the god of war would never scorn , rearing midst their ranks , nor would pallas athena driver of armies
nireus led his three trim ships from syme , nireus the son of aglaea and king charopus , nireus the handsomest man who ever came to troy , of all the achaeans after peleus ' fearless son
a woman or idiot boy could wound me so
i knew it then , even when zeus defended us with all his might , and i know it now , when he glorifies these trojans — he lifts them high as the blessed deathless gods but ties our hands and lames our fighting spirit
a crack of the lash and his driver whipped the team with streaming manes straight for the curved ships , and on they flew , holding nothing back , their heaving chests foaming , bellies pelted with dust , rushing the wounded warlord free and clear of battle
i ’ ll steady before your altar a bull with gilded brows , bright white with its head held high as its mother ’ s , butting its horns already , young hoofs kicking sand !
you could hear some trojan or achaean pleading , father zeus !
half his lance hung there in antilochus ' shield like a charred stake , half dropped to the ground
not even heracles fled his death , for all his power , favorite son as he was to father zeus the king
a useless , dead weight on the good green earth — i , no man my equal among the bronze-armed achaeans , not in battle , only in wars of words that others win
die and be damned for all i care !
this , this was their pleasure after all , sealed long ago — zeus and the son of zeus , the distant deadly archer — though often before now they rushed to my defense
my right hand , aeneas , never saved your life
now kill or be killed !
but now , seeing the best of all achaeans fill your ranks , let one whose nerve impels him to fight with me come striding from your lines , a lone champion pitted against prince hector
and dear to the gods while we still shared this life — and they cared about you still , i see , even after death
but then , when the wrath came sweeping over the man , the same anger that swells the chests of others , for all their care and self-control — then , heart enraged at his own dear mother althaea , meleager kept to his bed beside his wedded wife , cleopatra
i must know it all
a shudder went shooting through the old man but he told his men to yoke the team at once
now , suddenly , battle thrilled them more than the journey home , than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land
he halted beside him there and let his message fly : quickly , son of asclepius , king agamemnon calls !
the army rose in uproar
but the two atridae stayed , and good odysseus , nestor , idomeneus , phoenix the old charioteer , all trying to comfort achilles deep in sorrow
others , i have no doubt , will forge the bronze to breathe with suppler lines , draw from the block of marble features quick with life , plead their cases better , chart with their rods the stars that climb the sky and foretell the times they rise
deeply shaken , the god who rocks the earth replied , hera , what wild words !
setting his fears aside , he starts out on his story : i come from ithaca , my country
she reared before you , skewed the tearing shaft , flicking it off your skin as quick as a mother flicks a fly from her baby sleeping softly
and now holding that great shield before his chest telamonian ajax marched right up to hector , threatening with his deep resounding voice , hector , now you will learn , once and for all , in combat man-to-man , what kind of champions range the argive ranks , even besides achilles , that lionheart who mauls battalions wholesale
even the seer tolumnius falls , the first to wing a lance against the foe
when an old man 's killed and the dogs go at the gray head and the gray beard and mutilate the genitals — that is the crudest sight in all our wretched lives !
hera broke into smiles now , her eyes wide — with a smile she tucked the band between her breasts
that high and mighty king agamemnon , that son of atreus !
i know i can overpower this dazzling hector
jove himself lifts up his scales , balanced , trued , and in them he sets the opposing fates of both
if only we , we gods who defend the argives had the will to hurl the trojans back and hold off thundering zeus — there he would sit and smolder , throned in desolate splendor up on ida
just one more , my generous king !
under podarces sailed their forty long black ships
why such concern for enemies ?
or are we all fools , father , to dread the bolts you hurl ?
there in the entryway , the gorge of hell itself , grief and the pangs of conscience make their beds , and fatal pale disease lives there , and bleak old age , dread and hunger , seductress to crime , and grinding poverty , all , terrible shapes to see—and death and deadly struggle and sleep , twin brother of death , and twisted , wicked joys and facing them at the threshold , war , rife with death , and the furies ’ iron chambers , and mad , raging strife whose blood-stained headbands knot her snaky locks
he charged acamas — acamas could not stand the attack , he ran — and peneleos stabbed at ilioneus instead , a son of the herdsman phorbas rich in flocks , hermes ' favorite trojan : hermes gave him wealth but ilioneus ' mother gave him just one son
as the word spread , the ranks were struck dumb and icy fear sent shivers down their spines
at once she called to turnus ’ sister , goddess to goddess , the lady of lakes and rilling brooks , an honor the high and mighty king of heaven bestowed on juturna once he had ravished the virgin girl : nymph , beauty of streams , our heart ’ s desire , well you know how i have favored you , you above all the italian women who have mounted that ungrateful bed of our warm-hearted jove— i gladly assigned you a special place in heaven
and moving off to a safe distance , over and over the old priest prayed to the son of sleek-haired leto , lord apollo , hear me , apollo !
and then no way to escape my death , my certain doom — achilles is far too strong for any man on earth
iris quick as the breezes tried to soothe him : wait , god of the sea-blue mane who grips the earth — you really want me to take that harsh , unbending answer back to zeus ?
from that day on i have known of troy ’ s disaster , known your name , and all the kings of greece
command poseidon to quit the war and slaughter now , go back to the tribes of gods or down to his bright sea
but you hang back of your own accord , refuse to fight
if fate has saved that man , if he still draws strength from the air we breathe , if he ’ s not laid low , not yet with the heartless shades , fear not , nor will you once regret the first step you take to compete with him in kindness
you think that thundering zeus , shielding the men of troy , will rage as he raged for great heracles , his own son ?
so he vaunted , rearing against achilles , seething , heaving up in fury , thundering out now in foam and blood and corpses — the bloodred crest of the river swelled by zeus came arching higher , ready to tear pelides down but hera , struck with fear for achilles , screamed out , dreading he might be swept away by the giant churning river and quickly cried to the god of fire , her own dear son , to arms , my child — god of the crooked legs !
why does he shut his pitiless ears to my appeals ?
some cut it into quivering strips , impale it on skewers , some set cauldrons along the beach and fire them to the boil
all the rest they burn , unnumbered and unsung , an enormous tangled mass of bloody carnage waits and the wasteland far and wide lights up with fires , with pyre on pyre striving to outblaze the last
by this , this scepter , look , that never again will put forth crown and branches , now it 's left its stump on the mountain ridge forever , nor will it sprout new green again , now the brazen ax has stripped its bark and leaves , and now the sons of achaea pass it back and forth as they hand their judgments down , upholding the honored customs whenever zeus commands — this scepter will be the mighty force behind my oath : someday , i swear , a yearning for achilles will strike achaea 's sons and all your armies !
here at the first assault the trojans shouldered back the fiery-eyed achaeans — a myrmidon had been hit , and not their least man , dauntless agacles ' son , renowned epigeus
now like a wolfpack out for blood on a foggy night , driven blindly on by relentless , rabid hunger , leaving cubs behind , waiting , jaws parched— so through spears , through enemy ranks we plow to certain death , striking into the city ’ s heart , the shielding wings of the darkness beating round us
the ships are ablaze
bend to the oars !
wake quick little ajax , meges too
you know his rage yourself
on he fought like a whirlwind , staunch as always — think of the hounds and huntsmen circling round some lion or boar when the quarry wheels at bay , rippling in strength as the men mass like a bastion standing up to his charge and hurl their pelting spears and the boar 's brave spirit never flinches , never bolts and his own raw courage kills him — time and again he wheels around , testing the huntsmen 's ranks and where he lunges out the ranks of men give way
picture an ocean rolling , waves ebbing and flowing , now flooding onto the shore , smashing over the cliffs in a burst of foam and drenching the bay ’ s sandy edge— now rushing in fast retreat , swallowing down the scree lost in the backwash , leaving the shallows high and dry : so twice the etruscans hurled the latins toward their walls , twice routed , glancing round they cover their backs with shields
as lavinia heard her mother ’ s pleas , her warm cheeks bathed in tears , a blush flamed up and infused her glowing features
so the clash of achaean and trojan troops was on its own , the battle in all its fury veering back and forth , careering down the plain as they sent their bronze lances hurtling side-to-side between the simois ' banks and xanthus ' swirling rapids
quickly he poured a mist across achilles ' eyes , wrenched the spear from stalwart aeneas ' shield , laid the bronze-shod ashen shaft at achilles ' feet and hoisting aeneas off the earth he slung him far
he flared up and the swift runner achilles smiled , delighting in antilochus — he liked the man immensely
the more we have got , the better the work will go !
and helen the radiance of women answered priam , i revere you so , dear father , dread you too — if only death had pleased me then , grim death , that day i followed your son to troy , forsaking my marriage bed , my kinsmen and my child , my favorite , now full-grown , and the lovely comradeship of women my own age
whirling he stabbed dryops , speared him right through the neck — he dropped at his feet and achilles left him dead and smashed demuchus ' knee , philetor 's strapping son , stopped him right in his tracks with a well-flung spear then sprang with his great sword and ripped his life away
the goddess led the way
and first by far was oileus ' son , quick little ajax — he lunged out and his spearhead skewered satnius , enops ' son the lithe nymph of the ford once bore to enops tending his flocks by satniois ' banks
war cries rising , everywhere , on and on they charge , packing the trench with earth , some men hurling fiery torches onto the rooftops
and at his side , his son , ascanius , second hope of rome ’ s imposing power , while a priest in pure white robes leads on the young of a bristly boar and an unshorn yearling sheep toward the flaming altars
so the cretan yelled and all his comrades came in a pack with one will , massing round him , bracing shields to shoulders
idomeneus skewered erymas straight through the mouth , the merciless brazen spearpoint raking through , up under the brain to split his glistening skull — teeth shattered out , both eyes brimmed to the lids with a gush of blood and both nostrils spurting , mouth gaping , blowing convulsive sprays of blood and death 's dark cloud closed down around his corpse
next agamemnon ’ s man who hated the very name of troy—halaesus , yoking his team to a chariot , speeds along a thousand diehard clans in turnus ’ cause
let them sing of such an alliance , such a wedding hymn , the matchless son of venus and that grand king latinus !
let me spill his corpse on the ground and strip his breastplate , rip it to bits with my bare hands—that phrygian eunuch— defile his hair in the dust , his tresses crimped with a white-hot curling-iron dripping myrrh !
so the missiles showering from their hands — achaeans , trojans , helmets and bossed shields clashing , ringing shrilly under the blows of boulders big as millstones
the argives ' work was finished
and he hurled his sharp spear from a strong hand — a hard true hit on achilles ' shin below the knee !
a loathsome ooze discharges from their bellies , talons for hands , their jaws deathly white with a hunger never sated
but still euryalus glowed with a killer ’ s stealth , he was stalking nearer messapus ’ henchmen now , he could spot the outer campfires flickering low and horses tethered securely , grazing grass—the cavalry— when nisus , sensing his comrade run amok with bloodlust , cuts him short : call it quits , the dawn ’ s at hand , our old foe
for a while now a craving ’ s urged me on to swing into action , some great exploit— no peace and quiet for me
so , at our wit ’ s end , we send eurypylus off to question apollo ’ s oracle now , and back he comes from the god ’ s shrine with these bleak words : with blood you appeased the winds , with a virgin ’ s sacrifice when you , you greeks , first sought the shores of troy
so i am going — her message must not come to nothing
every one of us knows the ropes in war
he sealed himself in his house and dropped the reins of power
medon the bastard son of royal king oileus , little ajax ' brother , but medon lived in phylace , banished from native land — he would killed a kinsman dear to oileus ' wife , his stepmother eriopis — but iphiclus son of phylacus bore podarces
one can achieve his fill of all good things , even of sleep , even of making love
now off you go , move on , wherever the path leads you , steer your steps
avoid his grasp , he warns
here is the queen , with a grand cortege of ladies bearing gifts and riding up to minerva ’ s temple , set on the heights , and beside her rides the girl , the princess lavinia , cause of all their grief , her lovely eyes bent low
bury me , quickly — let me pass the gates of hades
and following in his wake sails irresistible astyr , astyr who trusts to his horse and armor rainbow-hued
now she stalks the bones , the ashes of murdered troy !
now some gear up to cross the plains on foot , some , riding high on their horses , wildly churn the dust and all shout out to arms ! —polishing shields smooth , burnishing lances bright with thick rich grease , honing their axes keen on grindstones
with a god 's help i just might rouse him now , bring his fighting spirit round at last
now not a single lycian goes to fight the argives , not to save your troy
but aeneas it was whom phoebus , urger of armies , filled with power now and drove against achilles
never has longing for you overwhelmed me so , no , not even then , i tell you , that first time when i swept you up from the lovely hills of lacedaemon , sailed you off and away in the racing deep-sea ships and we went and locked in love on rocky island
i shake off sleep and scrambling up to the pitched roof i stand there , ears alert , and i hear a roar like fire assaulting a wheatfield , whipped by a southwind ’ s fury , or mountain torrent in full spate , flattening crops , leveling all the happy , thriving labor of oxen , dragging whole trees headlong down in its wake— and a shepherd perched on a sheer rock outcrop hears the roar , lost in amazement , struck dumb
who was the first trojan the marksman teucer hit ?
rushing to block them , corynaeus grabs a flaming torch from the altar—just so ebysus can ’ t strike first—and hurls fire in the latin ’ s face and his huge beard flares up , reeking with burnt singe
as he groaned from the depths his mother rose before him and sobbing a sharp cry , cradled her son 's head in her hands and her words were all compassion , winging pity : my child — why in tears ?
never give up your lust for war against these argives !
like a stubborn ass some boys lead down a road
troy ’ s up in flames , the rest are looting , sacking the city heights
where pallas rifles his spear full force and sweeps his flashing sword from its casing sheath
and again i rush to arms , desperate to die myself
the queen— when from her house she sees the enemy coming strong , walls assaulted , flames surging up to the roofs and no rutulian force in sight to block their way , no troops of turnus , then , poor woman , she thinks him killed in the press of war and suddenly lost in the frenzied grip of sorrow , claims that she ’ s the cause , the criminal , source of disaster— shrilling wild words in her crazed , grieving fit and bent on death , ripping her purple gown for a noose , she knots it high to a rafter , dies a gruesome death
but from the moment that godless diomedes , flanked by ulysses , the mastermind of crime , attacked and tore the fateful image of pallas out of her own hallowed shrine , and cut down the sentries ringing your city heights and seized that holy image and even dared touch the sacred bands on the virgin goddess ’ head with hands reeking blood— from that hour on , the high hopes of the greeks had trickled away like a slow , ebbing tide
the archers gather now , cast lots in a bronze helmet , and first to leap out , to partisan shouts , is hippocoön , son of hyrtacus
three times i fled around the great city of priam — i lacked courage then to stand your onslaught
now for mastery , all your skill !
then in an avid stream the mothers and unarmed crowds and frail old men find seats on towers and rooftops , others take their stand on the high gates
with that he slipped his tunic over his chest , under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals , pinned with a brooch his crimson cape around him , flowing in double folds and topped with thick fleece , and gripping a tough spear tipped with a brazen point , he strode along the ships of the argives armed in bronze
he gouged her just where the wristbone joins the palm and immortal blood came flowing quickly from the goddess , the ichor that courses through their veins , the blessed gods — they eat no bread , they drink no shining wine , and so the gods are bloodless , so we call them deathless
he ca not escape , i tell you , not this wrenching battle
relent , achilles — you too !
trojan and latin war cries set the sky on fire as aeneas dashes up and wrenching his sword from its sheath , he triumphs over him : where ’ s the fierce mezentius now ?
teucer took the challenge , rushed to his side and reflex bow in hand and quiver bristling shafts he loosed a splattering burst against the trojans
and in his command sailed fifty long black ships
you gods of my fathers , now i follow wherever you lead me , i am with you
plunging on he goes , overtaking their finest , turnus ’ front-line troops : antaeus , lucas and stalwart numa and camers with tawny locks , magnanimous volcens ’ son , the richest landholder in all italy once , the lord of amyclae , quiet town
we launch out on the foaming waves as wind and helmsman call our course
and soon as the men had prayed and flung the barley , first they lifted back the heads of the victims , slit their throats , skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat , a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh
the man received it gladly
i had hoped by now , once we destroyed them all — all the achaeans and all their hollow ships — we might turn home to the windy heights of troy
so , couldn ’ t they stay defeated in defeat ?
soon as he saw our dardan dress from afar , our trojan swords , he froze in his tracks a moment , gripped by fear , then breakneck made for the shore with tears and prayers : i beg you , trojans , beg by the stars , the gods above , the clear bright air we breathe—sail me off and away !
and soon leucata ’ s cloudy summit comes into view and apollo ’ s shrine on its rugged headland , dread of sailors
the great debate had closed
with a god 's help you just might rouse him now , bring his fighting spirit round at last
so the men can see , that instant , your black blood gush and spurt around my spear !
neither the land of troy could hold her back , setting sail with me , nor king acestes ’ city
he refused to let his two boys march to war , this man-killing war , but the young ones fought him all the way — the forces of black death drove them on
then patron flanked by salius , an acarnanian , one , and one an arcadian born of tegean blood
but proetus plotted against him
and with each cry he thrust his slashing pike with a fresh new fury
if only i ’ d joined ranks with our trojan comrades here and latin spears had hurled me down !
no one — but at least he hears you are still alive and his old heart rejoices , hopes rising , day by day , to see his beloved son come sailing home from troy
sped by his four-horse chariot , flaunting torches , right through the greek tribes and elis city ’ s heart he rode in triumph , claiming as his the honors of the gods
so return the girl to the god , at least for now
not for the argives
what prevents us from building walls right here , presenting our citizens with a city ?
we ’ re never again to see the rivers hector loved , the simois and the xanthus ?
and the guide and giant-killer answered staunchly , you are testing me , old man — asking of noble hector
there i saw the twin sons of aloeus too , giant bodies that clawed the soaring sky with their hands to tear it down and thrust great jove from his kingdom high above
you would eat your fill , i would hold the cup to your lips and all too often you soaked the shirt on my chest , spitting up some wine , a baby 's way
i would be shattered — what could i do to save you ?
the tracks in his wake , his stride as he sped away — i know him at once , with ease — no mistaking the gods
the almighty father answered , three times over , rending the cloudless sky with claps of thunder , flourishing high in his own hand from heaven ’ s peak a cloud on fire with rays of gold , with radiance
but if i should take on hector and hector 's trojans alone , in single combat — trying to save my pride — wo not they encircle me , one against so many ?
and i would be ashamed to pour a glistening cup to zeus with unwashed hands
from there the entire ida ridge swung clear in view , the city of priam clear and the warships of achaea
but now , look , he gives you a trove of treasures right away , and vows there are more to follow
taking a man 's shape , the cicones ' captain mentes , apollo spurred him on with winged orders : hector — you are chasing the wild wind , fiery achilles ' team !
but if he will not surrender her , i will go myself , i will seize her myself , with an army at my back — and all the worse for him !
and out like a flashing snowcapped peak he moved , shouting , sweeping on through his ranks and trojan allies
next he brings down amycus , gifted killer of wild game— no hand more skilled at dipping an arrow ’ s point or capping a lance with poison—then clytius , aeolus ’ son , then cretheus , friend of the muses , the muses ’ comrade , cretheus , always dear to his heart the song and lyre , tuning a verse to the taut string , always singing of cavalry , weapons , wars and the men who fight them
sit in front of me , so you can see your husband of long ago , your kinsmen and your people
on his mother ’ s side , well born , but his father ’ s side remains a blank
so wild the man 's fury he will never rest content , holding out on the plain where trojans and argives met halfway , exchanging blows in the savage onset — never : he will fight for our wives , for troy itself !
once in the past he came our way , king odysseus heading the embassy they sent for your release , together with menelaus dear to ares
father zeus , i swear , will never defend the trojans , liars — they were the first to trample on their oaths
look , i have lifted the mist from off your eyes that 's blurred them up to now — so you can tell a god from man on sight
so bloated with all your empty pride , pulling your slippery inbred tricks for nothing !
so with you and me
while all the rest of us , every god on olympus bows down to you , each of us overpowered
his breastplate could not save him , the bronze he always wore , and the shaft pierced his bowels
at last she comes , with a great retinue crowding round the queen who wears a tyrian cloak with rich embroidered fringe
cries go up , squadrons form , galloping hoofbeats drum the rutted plain with thunder
she screamed and her scream rang out through all troy : come , look down , you men of troy , you trojan women !
i rank her higher than clytemnestra , my wedded wife — she 's nothing less in build or breeding , in mind or works of hand
but kind diana hides the man away in a secret haunt , sends him off to egeria , deep in the nymph ’ s grove where , alone in italian woods and all unsung— virbius , his new name—he might live out his time
let him know he 's loved by the greatest gods on high while the gods who up till now have shielded troy from war and death are worthless as the wind !
quick , call to the chiefs — if one can hear you now
it ’ s clear , aeneas comes by the will of fate , the word on high
and now as the powers wrangled back and forth the lord god apollo entered holy troy , filled with dread for the city 's sturdy walls : what if the argive forces stormed them down today — against the will of fate ?
make your plans together
there — at a dead run meriones ran down acamas , acamas mounting behind his team , and gouged his right shoulder — he pitched from the car and the mist whirled down his eyes
brave hearts in war , our tempers steeled , our armies proved in action
so he triumphed and again he was bent on outrage , on shaming noble hector — he flung him facedown in the dust beside patroclus ' bier
past his strength no man can go , though he 's set on mortal combat
dog that he is , he would never dare to look me straight in the eyes again
so imbrius fell , the fine bronze armor clashing against him hard
— what help is he to you ?
a cry hits the skies , all the latins turning to watch as tarchon flies like wildfire down the field , bearing the man and weapons both , then wrenches off the iron point of venulus ’ spear and delves around for a spot laid bare where a lethal blow might land , the other fighting off the enemy ’ s hand from his throat , pitting force against fury
funeral games for anchises all the while aeneas , steeled for a mid-sea passage , held the fleet on course , well on their way now , plowing the waves blown dark by a northwind as he glanced back at the walls of carthage set aglow by the fires of tragic dido ’ s pyre
doomed to a short life , you have so little time
be good to me now , you shades of the dead below , for the gods above have turned away their favors
i was born in troy , and the blood you see is oozing from no tree
leave the deep sea to the rest !
flanked by his son , pallas , the ranking men and the lowly senate , all were offering incense now , and warm blood was steaming on the altars
he hurled — his spear 's long shadow flew and it struck ajax ' shield , that awesome seven-layered buckler , right on the eighth , the outside layer of bronze that topped it off , through six hides it tore but the seventh stopped the relentless brazen point
at the same time the wrenching news hits turnus still in the woods
but now , i say , let us give way to the dark night , set out the evening meal
here a freer air , a dazzling radiance clothes the fields and the spirits possess their own sun , their own stars
now , the decii and the drusi—look over there—torquatus too , with his savage axe , camillus bringing home the standards
how fortunate , both at once !
now you will never live to see our kingdom born , never ride in triumph home to your father ’ s house
the king , bent with years , kept his comrades , aeneas and his son , beside him , moving on as he eased the way with many stories
there 's a dead tree-stump standing six feet high , it 's oak or pine , not rotted through by the rains , and it 's propped by two white stones on either side
but if i snuff your life out in my hands , you will never annoy our argive lines again
no , my dearest husband , i ’ d never put you to work in a lost cause , much as i owed to priam ’ s sons , however often i wept for aeneas ’ grueling labors
now strife hurled down the leveler hate amidst both sides , wading into the onslaught , flooding men with pain
down on the ground he dashed the scepter studded bright with golden nails , then took his seat again
why , you could be my son , my youngest-born at that , though you urge our kings with cool clear sense : what you have said is right
this achilles — he will reap the rewards of that great courage of his alone , i tell you — weep his heart out far too late , when our troops are dead and gone
trail the field out but pass them all at the post , no one can catch you then or overtake you with a surge — not if the man behind you were driving huge arion , adrastus ' lightning stallion sired by the gods , or laomedon 's team , the greatest bred in troy
if you think all greeks are one , if hearing the name greek is enough for you , it ’ s high time you made me pay the price
the rest fought on with deafening war cries rising
all atremble , he carries on with his tale , lying from the cockles of his heart : time and again the greeks had yearned to abandon troy—bone-tired from a long hard war—to put it far behind and beat a clean retreat
take my commands through the racing winds and tell him this is not the man his mother , the lovely goddess , promised , not for this did she save him twice from greek attacks
that breathed tremendous strength in the famous captain
but his father hears their wails far off and stirred by a grim foreboding , knows it all
just as early , aeneas is stirring too
and the two aeantes ranged all points of the rampart , calling out commands to spur their comrades ' fury
then for the runner-up he brought forth a mare , unbroken , six years old , with a mule foal in her womb
despite all that , the flames , the implacable fire never quits its fury
what is left at the last ?
not you — you are the one who knows me best , i would say
but his wailing failed to move the heart of zeus : it was zeus 's pleasure to hand the prize to hector
so , force me , will he , to wrench my will to his ?
this message mighty juno in person ordered me to give you here , asleep in the dead of night
he sprang to his feet , calling down to cohorts , friends — lords of the argives , o my captains — am i the only one who can spot that pair or can you see them too ?
— son of peleus , you a mortal and i a deathless god
she thrives on speed , stronger for every stride , slight with fear at first , soon soaring into the air she treads the ground and hides her head in the clouds
i am a myrmidon , and my father is polyctor , and a wealthy man he is , about as old as you
when would some other argive unit make its charge , engage the trojan front and open up in battle ?
only if you could breach their gates and their long walls and devour priam and priam 's sons and the trojan armies raw — then you just might cure your rage at last
and all his clothes and crowning it all , the bridal bed that brought my doom
armor must be forged for a man of courage !
but meriones caught him in full retreat , he let fly with a bronze-tipped arrow , hitting his right buttock up under the pelvic bone so the lance pierced the bladder
you , turnus , the guilt is yours , and a dreadful end awaits you— you will implore the gods with prayers that come too late !
here in my own land she founded her paltry city for a pittance
plead with my imperious enemy
helenus charged deipyrus , cleft the side of his head with a massive thracian sword , smashed his helmet and knocked it off
they hauled their chariots up in ranks , at rest , the troops dismounted and stripped away their arms and laid them down on the earth , crowded together — hardly a foot of plowland showed between them
three times patroclus charged the jut of the high wall , three times apollo battered the man and hurled him back , the god 's immortal hands beating down on the gleaming shield
i too can trace my birth from jove on high
better to waste time , skirting sicily then in a long arc rounding cape pachynus , than once set eyes on gruesome scylla deep in her cave , her rocks booming with all her sea-green hounds
aeneas was first — he aimed and hurled at idomeneus but the cretan saw it coming , dodged the brazen tip and aeneas ' lance plunged in the earth , quivering , his arm 's power poured in a wasted shot
follow me , fight for alcathous , your brother-in-law who reared you at home when you were just a boy
lay it away as a treasure
as he bent to the work with all his craft and cunning , thetis on her glistening feet drew near the smith
then at last , screeching out on their grinding hinge the infernal gates swing wide
else he will spear you down or close for the kill and hack you with his sword
he swore his mighty oath — blinded , from that hour on
it 's well to lift our hands and ask great zeus for mercy
just as we grew up together in your house , after menoetius brought me there from opois , and only a boy , but banished for bloody murder the day i killed amphidamas ' son
wait , take the princely ransom of bronze and gold , the gifts my father and noble mother will give you — but give my body to friends to carry home again , so trojan men and trojan women can do me honor with fitting rites of fire once i am dead
there 's powerful diomedes brought down by an archer , odysseus wounded , and agamemnon too , the famous spearman , and eurypylus took a shaft in the thigh , and here , machaon — i just brought him in from the fighting , struck down by an arrow whizzing off the string
why , it 's as if they had caught you in public , doing something wrong
come , let us stand our ground together — beat him back
some are turned away from the banks and others scull the murky waters with their oars !
and so we give polydorus a fresh new burial , piling masses of earth on his first mound , raising to all the shades below an altar dark with the wreaths of grief and dead-black cypress ringed by trojan women , hair unbound in mourning
but the swift runner achilles answered firmly , phoenix , old father , bred and loved by the gods , what do i need with honor such as that ?
the winds swerved from the north and drove them safe to port
all of us right behind you , hearts intent on battle
shaft on shaft , no stopping him till he stretches seven hefty carcasses on the ground—a triumph , one for each of his ships—and makes for the cove , divides the kill with his whole crew and then shares out the wine that good acestes , princely man , had brimmed in their casks the day they left sicilian shores
— that made you famous once , both among outland men and those you rule in troy !
the bloody arm dropped to the earth , and red death came plunging down his eyes , and the strong force of fate
so now , for the night , we guard our own positions , but tomorrow at daybreak , armed to the hilt for battle , waken slashing war against their hollow hulls
he whistled shrill , his signal to rugged diomedes pausing , deep in thought
nor did the god of earthquakes fail to hear the goddess
all stand in the forecourt , and all the other kings from the start of time , and those who had taken wounds in war , fighting to save their country
time and again she placed herself on a par with their own mother , leto in her immortal beauty — how she insulted leto : 'all you have borne is two , but i have borne so many !
cowards , i know , would quit the fighting now but the man who wants to make his mark in war must stand his ground and brace for all he 's worth — suffer his wounds or wound his man to death
and atreus ' son drew forth the dagger always slung at his battle-sword 's big sheath , he cut some hairs from the boar 's head , first tufts to start the rite , and lifting up his arms to zeus on high he prayed while the armies held fast to their seats in silence , all by rank and file , listening to their king
too many kings can ruin an army — mob rule !
musing over the shifting tides of war as pallas flanks him closely on his left , asking now of the stars that guide them through the night and now of the hardships he had braved on land and sea
now in came envoys sent from the latin city , bearing olive branches and pleading for a truce
tell him about my vicious work , how neoptolemus degrades his father ’ s name—don ’ t you forget
there is a valley full of twists and turns , a perfect spot for the lures and subterfuge of battle , both of its sides closed off and dark with thick brush
the trojan son of anchises , stunned with awe , his spirits lift with the sign and scanning the skies above his head aeneas prays a few strong words : ida ’ s generous queen and mother of the gods , by dindyma dear to your heart , by towered cities , the double team of lions yoked to your reins , lead me in war , bring on the omen , goddess , speed the trojans home with your victor ’ s stride !
he dies fighting for fatherland — no dishonor there !
breathing room in war is all too brief
but ajax did stab home at the shield 's jutting bulge , beating hector back with enormous driving force and he gave ground , back and away from both corpses as argives hauled them from the fighting by the heels
send such a rout of first-rate fighters down to death and never pay the price ?
stinging taunts inflame the will of the fighters all the more till a low growing murmur steals along the lines
why thrash things out ?
meriones back on attack — a savage swoop like a vulture — yanked the spear from the trojan 's shoulder joint and back he drew into crowds of waiting troops
book four : the truce erupts in war
now shield against oxhide shield , wedging tight , with a wild rush they charged the argives head-on , never thinking the argive line could still hold out — they would all be hurled back on their blackened hulls
with those words , drawing him toward her there , she made a place for the old man beside the holy shrine
achilles led them now in a throbbing chant of sorrow , laying his man-killing hands on his great friend 's chest : farewell , patroclus , even there in the house of death !
glare of the fires lit my view as i looked down , scanning the city left and right , and there she was
but the argives rose in grief to avenge that boast — skilled peneleos most of all , anger blazed inside him
or if you prefer , hold off a moment now
bring him on , i say !
so homeward bound , your ships and hardy shipmates anchor in port now or approach the harbor ’ s mouth , full sail ahead
all as one the armies cried out in sorrow , and achilles led the chant
now i can only tell the lords of the ships , the ships in all their numbers !
how could he know what work the father had in mind ?
spreading both arms wide
let this be part of our peace , to grasp your leader ’ s hand
leave me alone , have done — captain of armies , i am filled with horror !
hector 's holding council with all his chiefs , mapping plans on old king ilus ' barrow , clear of the crowds at camp
look , like wasps quick and pinched at the waist or bees who build their hives on a rocky path , they never give up their hollow house , they hold on , keep the honey-hunters at bay , fight for their young
think , since you fired our comrades ' fury against the ships , from that hour we have held our ground right here , taking the argives on , and nonstop , no rest
but hera and great athena were looking on and with mocking words began to provoke the father , athena leading off with taunts , her eyes bright : father zeus , i wonder if you would fume at me if i ventured a bold guess ?
don ’ t pray to me now
i broke all bonds , i tore the promised bride from her waiting groom , i brandished a wicked sword
no one 's picked to defend the army
but , oh , how tossed he ’ s been by the blows of fate
you — it 's your duty to stand in the front ranks and take your share of the scorching blaze of battle
he lacks the sense to see a day behind , a day ahead , and safeguard the achaeans battling by the ships
a woman matched with a god , with hercules , hero of tiryns come to the latin land in glory , fresh from cutting the monster geryon down , to wash the herds of spain in the tiber river
but apollo quickly pulled him up — and now they would have closed with swords , hacked each other if heralds of zeus and men had not come rushing in , one from the trojans , one from the armed achaeans , talthybius and idaeus , both with good clear heads
he smashes thoas full in the face with a rock and crushes out his skull in a spray of brains and blood
this warrior girl , with her young hands untrained for minerva ’ s spools and baskets filled with wool , a virgin seasoned to bear the rough work of battle , swift to outrace the winds with her lightning pace
war — i know it well , and the butchery of men
stalking along the ships , alone through camp in the very dead of night when other mortals try to catch some sleep
suddenly , right before their eyes , look , a potent marvel destined to shape the future !
but you , who are you ?
so , conversing and drawing near evander ’ s humble home , they saw herds of cattle , everywhere , lowing loud in the roman forum and carinae ’ s elegant district
joining forces with them , the trojan escorts mass to form a growing column of mourners on the march
broad as the door of a rich man 's vaulted treasure-chamber , well-fitted with sturdy bars , so broad each wing of the bird spread out on either side as it swept in through the city flashing clear on the right before the king and queen
hippothous and pylaeus , tested soldier , led them on , both sons of pelasgian lethus , teutamus ' scion
tell me the whole truth
hair loose in the wind , the priestess thunders out the names of her three hundred gods , erebus , chaos and triple hecate , diana the three-faced virgin
book twenty-three : funeral games for patroclus
never so swift the teams in a two-horse chariot race breaking headlong out of the gates to take the field , not even when charioteers lay on the rippling reins , leaning into the whip-stroke , giving the teams full head
the second trojan battalion paris led in arms with alcathous and agenor
topping off the armies rides camilla , sprung from the volscian people , heading her horsemen , squadrons gleaming bronze
and round it he cut a ditch in dark blue enamel and round the ditch he staked a fence in tin
what soldier could warm to that ?
and whirling round he cried to his trojans , shouting through the ruck , the wall , storm the wall !
shaking a spear polydamas moved in fast to the rescue , panthous ' son lancing the right shoulder of prothoenor , arielycus ' son , and the heavy shaft impaled his upper arm — he pitched in the dust , clawing the earth with both hands and polydamas shouted over him , wild with glory now : here is another spear that leaps from my strong arm , from panthous ' brave son , and hits its mark , by god !
they rush to ring the palace of king latinus round , but he stands fast like a rock at sea , a seabound rock that won ’ t give way : when a big surge hits and the howling breakers pound it hard , its bulk stands fast though its foaming reefs and spurs roar on , all for nothing , as seaweed dashing against its flanks swirls away in the backwash
if only she ’ d never been carried away to serve in such a war— bent on challenging trojans
but venus , incensed that the nymph has had her brazen way , steps up and plucks aeneas ’ spear from the clinging root
with that , he harnessed his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car , his pair that raced the wind with their golden manes streaming on behind them , and strapping golden armor around his body , zeus himself took up his whip that coils lithe and gold and climbed aboard
so meriones yelled and idomeneus whipped the team with their manes streaming , back to the hollow ships — fear seized the king at last
a dark glance and the headstrong runner answered him in kind : shameless — armored in shamelessness — always shrewd with greed !
he called out to his smaller , faster brother with orders flying , ajax , you stay here , you and the burly lycomedes stand your ground , keep our danaans fighting here with all they have got
the king has sons
but the swift runner achilles interjected , field marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , better busy yourself with that some other time , when a sudden lull in the fighting lets us rest and the fury 's not such fire inside my heart
then back to troy they bore deiphobus , groaning hard , in agony , blood from his fresh wound pouring down his arm
he grieves , he weeps , but then his tears are through
i am not from the same womb as hector , hector who killed your friend , your strong , gentle friend !
and sarpedon 's charge cut hector to the core
powerless now to keep that trojan king from italy ?
the achaean and trojan forces both exulted , hoping this would end the agonies of war
let this entire spread , plus highlands ringed with pines , be given the trojans now to win their friendship
they must be sitting there , waiting for us now
and the troops were growing bored , so at last the giant ajax spurred his rival , grunting , son of laertes — resourceful one , enough — you hoist me or i hoist you — and leave the rest to zeus
cut this shaft from my thigh
athena and blazing ares will deal with all the bloodshed
soon as his winged feet touched down on the first huts in sight , he spots aeneas founding the city fortifications , building homes in carthage
and catillus brings down iollas , then herminius , massive in courage , immense in brawn and armor , his blond locks flowing bare and his shoulders bare , no fear of wounds , so huge his body exposed to spears
the signs of the old flame , i know them well
always bringing word of mighty zeus 's plans , but not this time
he crashed in the dust — godlike achilles gloried over him : hector — surely you thought when you stripped patroclus ' armor that you , you would be safe !
we who defiled the fields of troy with swords— why mention all the pain we drank to the dregs , fighting beneath those walls , or the men we lost , drowned in simois river ?
no loving mother will bury you in the ground or weight your body down with your fathers ’ tomb
spun like locusts swarming up in the air , whipped by rushing fire , flitting toward a river — the tireless fire blazes , scorching them all with hard explosive blasts of flame and beaten down in the depths the floating locusts huddle — so at achilles ' charge the xanthus ' swirling currents choked with a spate of horse and men — the river roared
what patch of ground now holds your body cut to pieces , your mutilated corpse ?
my right hand will give you the earth you crossed the seas to find
the two men swarmed over him , ripping the armor off his back as hector called his kinsmen on , all his kinsmen , but marked out hicetaon 's son the strong melanippus , railing first at him
why mention the war that ’ s boiling up in tyre , your brother ’ s deadly threats ?
a powerful trunk is lying on the shore
her voice rang out in tears and an endless wail rose up and helen , the third in turn , led their songs of sorrow : hector !
still , do not fling in my face the lovely gifts of golden aphrodite
run for your life , my son
you will hear it all , and with you all the immortals — what a chain of disasters zeus brings to light !
the greeks had taken the city , blocked off every gate
but the mounting cries of war could not escape old nestor , pausing over his wine
and idomeneus shouted , vaunting in wild glory , now , deiphobus , now shall we call it quits at last ?
the gathered armies scattered , each man to his fast ship , and fighters turned their minds to thoughts of food and the sweet warm grip of sleep
and that comrade who meets his death and destiny , speared or stabbed , let him die !
he ranged their ranks , inspiriting every captain , commanding mesthles , glaucus , medon , thersilochus , asteropaeus , disenor , hippothous , phorcys , chromius , ennomus too , who could read the flight of birds
how could she outmaneuver zeus the mastermind , this zeus with his battle-shield of storm and thunder ?
twice he charged the thick of his foes , twice he broke their lines , stampeding the trojans down their walls at speed
two aides-de-camp , phegeus and sagaris , hefting it on their shoulders now , could hardly bear it off with all its heavy plies , yet demoleos wore it once , fully armed as he ran down trojan stragglers
these lands , they say , were once an immense unbroken mass but long ago—such is the power of time to work great change as the ages pass—some vast convulsion sprang them apart , a surge of the sea burst in between them , cleaving sicily clear of hesperia ’ s flanks , dividing lands and towns into two coasts , rushing between them down a narrow tiderip
come to me , priam
neither man could see it , scanning the dark night , they only heard its cry
so at his command automedon yoked the horses , the rapid stallions roan beauty and dapple , the team that raced the gales , magnificent team the storm-wind filly lightfoot foaled for the west wind , grazing the lush green grass along the ocean 's tides
perhaps he ’ s shipwrecked , lost in woods or towns
the lord of the city , so the trojans called him , because it was you , hector , you and you alone who shielded the gates and the long walls of troy
at the sight of hector the father of men and gods filled with pity now and shooting a terrible dark glance down at hera , burst out at her , what a disaster you create !
latinus himself is struck that these two giant men , sprung from opposing ends of the earth , have met , face-to-face , to let their swords decide
with his order clear , he sent his brother off while he went after nestor , the old commander
i say my honor lies in the great decree of zeus
yes , the time will come when turnus would give his all to have pallas whole , intact , when all this spoil , this very day he ’ ll loathe
down the sky she swooped through the clear bright air like a shrieking , sharp-winged hawk , and while achaeans quickly armed throughout the encampment , she instilled some nectar and sweet ambrosia deep in achilles ' chest so the stabbing pangs of hunger could not sap his knees
for i , i gave you this , all of my own free will but hardly willing
now be fast to attack !
i ’ ll give two cretan arrows with polished iron points and a double axe embossed with knobs of silver
his plan won hector over — less danger , more success — and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground
athena 's eyes lit up and the goddess said , so be it , archer of the sky !
magnificent paris spoke first : dear brother , look at me , holding you back in all your speed — dragging my feet , coming to you so late , and you told me to be quick !
so he lashed out at his sons , cursing the sight of helenus , paris , noble agathon , pammon , antiphonus , polites loud with the war cry , deiphobus and hippothous , even lordly dius — the old man shouted at all nine , rough commands : get to your work !
whatever i choose to plan apart from all the gods — no more of your everlasting questions , probe and pry no more
ajax struck him right where the head and neckbone join , the last link in the spine , he cut both tendons through so the mouth and brow and nostrils hit the ground before the shins and knees as the man dropped dead
from here the terrible news goes racing through the city , spirits plunge—latinus , rending his robes to tatters , stunned by his wife ’ s death and his city ’ s fall , fouls his white hair with showers of dust
i saw salmoneus too , who paid a brutal price for aping the flames of jove and olympus ’ thunder
the one peneleos lanced beneath the brows , down to the eyes ' roots and scooped an eyeball out — the spear cut clean through the socket , out behind the nape and backward down he sat , both hands stretched wide as peneleos , quickly drawing his whetted sword , hacked him square in the neck and lopped his head and down on the ground it tumbled , helmet and all
but what a price he paid !
well you know how the whims of youth break all the rules
i know his snowy hair , his beard—the first king to found our rome on laws , numa , sent from the poor town of cures , paltry land , to wield imperial power
greek i am , i don ’ t deny it
the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs from zeus are about to crush the men of troy !
standing round him , loving comrades mourned , and the swift runner achilles joined them , grieving , weeping warm tears when he saw his steadfast comrade lying dead on the bier , mauled by tearing bronze , the man he sent to war with team and chariot but never welcomed home again alive
sit down with the comrades you command
it arrives in force as acca brings her commander word of stark disaster : volscian units routed , camilla fallen , enemy armies surging on , attacking on all fronts , and mars in his triumph , panic already shakes the city walls
he urges all the trojans , all the argives too , to lay their fine armor down on the fertile earth while paris himself and the warrior menelaus take the field between you and fight it out for helen and all her wealth in single combat
once they gained the spot where the most and bravest stood , flanking strong diomedes breaker of wild stallions — massed like a pride of lions tearing raw flesh or ramping boars whose fury never flags — the white-armed goddess hera rose and shouted loud as the brazen voice of great-lunged stentor who cries out with the blast of fifty other men , shame !
how his spirit leapt when he heard those horrors — and buckling his gleaming armor round his body , out he rushed to war
and off to the side , beneath a spreading oak , the heralds were setting out the harvest feast , they were dressing a great ox they had slaughtered , while attendant women poured out barley , generous , glistening handfuls strewn for the reapers ' midday meal
but he , desperate to slow the death of his dying father , preferred to master the power of herbs , the skills that cure , and pursue a healer ’ s practice , silent and unsung
she knew the goddess at once , the long lithe neck , the smooth full breasts and the fire in those eyes — and she was amazed , she burst out with her name : maddening one , my goddess , oh what now ?
always turning toward the plain , tense to catch some sign of the trojans launching an attack
this flashing hector has all troy at his back !
quick , fetch him his weapons !
but they owe it all to their own fighting strength — our great men of war , they lead our way in battle !
then achilles made his way through crowds of troops and set out prizes next for the bruising boxing-match
automedon held the meats while lordly achilles carved them into quarters , cut them well into pieces , pierced them with spits and patroclus raked the hearth , a man like a god making the fire blaze
no sooner had sleep caught him , dissolving all his grief as mists of refreshing slumber poured around him there — his powerful frame was bone-weary from charging hector straight and hard to the walls of windswept troy — than the ghost of stricken patroclus drifted up
and they pay us reparations fair and fitting , a price to inspire generations still to come
no , he honored a suppliant ’ s rights , he blushed to betray my trust , he restored my hector ’ s bloodless corpse for burial , sent me safely home to the land i rule !
the father nods his head in assent , i see , at last he grants me glory , triumph — the argives , bloody death
perhaps a skilled prophet revealed the spot — or their own fury whips them on to attack
if he outruns us , crowd him against the ships , cut him off from his lines , harry him with your spear and never stop — so he ca not bolt back to troy
no doubt you will hand your argives victory soon , you will turn the tide of battle !
the same fighters who pile your gifts at aegae port and helice , gifts by the shipload , hoards to warm your heart
and the women he and patroclus carried off as captives caught the grief in their hearts and keened and wailed , out of the tents they ran to ring the great achilles , all of them beat their breasts with clenched fists , sank to the ground , each woman 's knees gave way
but the trojans stormed them there and back they fell , they had no choice , edging away from the front ships but once at the tents nearby they held their ground , massing ranks , no scattering back through camp
whether italy ’ s happy fate lays siege to the camp or the trojans ’ folly , the deadly prophecies they follow
flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the house of death , wailing his fate , leaving his manhood far behind , his young and supple strength
i bring you a message sent by zeus , a world away but he has you in his heart , he pities you now
and the horses , each beside its chariot , champing clover and parsley from the marshes , waited , pawing idly
and thoas son of andraemon led aetolia 's units , soldiers who lived in pleuron , pylene and olenus , chalcis along the shore and calydon 's rocky heights where the sons of wellborn oeneus were no more and the king himself was dead and meleager with his golden hair was gone
wherever he looked , pains heaped on pains
stepping back from the pyre he cut the red-gold lock he would let grow long as a gift to the river god spercheus — scanning the wine-dark sea he prayed in anguish , spercheus !
polydamas killed mecisteus — polites cut down echius , first in the onset — dashing agenor cut down clonius — and paris lanced deiochus deep below the shoulder , ran him through from behind as he fled the front and the bronze spear came jutting out his chest
but now that he 's torn my honor from my hands , robbed me , lied to me — do not let him try me now
but here 's a maniac run amok — no one can match his fury man-to-man !
it 's hard for me , strong as i am , single-handed to make for such a force and fight them all
triumphant athena turned her shining eyes away and aphrodite daughter of zeus took ares ' hand and led him off the field , racked with groans , barely able to gather back his strength
like leaves , no sooner flourishing , full of the sun 's fire , feeding on earth 's gifts , than they waste away and die
they ’ re robbed of half the world and the other half , dry land , is in our grasp , so many thousand italians take up arms
while the golden posts of high festal couches gleam , and a banquet spreads before their eyes with luxury fit for kings
i have no taste for food — what i really crave is slaughter and blood and the choking groans of men !
close by , the myrmidons clung to the panting stallions straining to bolt away , free of their masters ' chariot
that 's where his grave-mound will be piled and then no need in the world to raise his barrow high when comrades come to give him royal rites !
why did she force a man , so famous for his devotion , to brave such rounds of hardship , bear such trials ?
but it brought no joy to the heart of agamemnon
taken a wound , some spearhead sapped your strength ?
let the doom of troy pursue us just this far , no more
and let him hurry himself along as well , so he can overtake me before i leave the city
where can i find you now ?
trust me , he said , all i do will be worthy of your great exploit : your mother will be mine in all but the name , creusa
he hacks to ground dolichaon ’ s son , hebrus , latagus with him and palmus who spins and runs— he smashes latagus square in the face and mouth with a rock , a crag of a rock , and cuts the knees from under the racing palmus , leaves him slowly writhing in pain and gives his armor to lausus , bronze for his shoulders , plumes to crown his crest
nobody knows who shot it , whirled it on to bring the rutulians such renown—what luck , what god— the shining fame of the feat is shrouded over now
mantua , source of the five hundred men mezentius goaded on to fight against himself : men the mincius , son of father benacus gowned in gray-green reeds , steers down to the sea in warships built of pine
both of us rush together to halt this mortal 's onslaught !
i command the men , wage all-out war against this brutal crew !
let hector call you a coward , scorn your courage — the trojan and dardan troops will never believe him , nor will the wives of the lusty trojan shieldsmen , never — you flung their lords in the dust , laid them low in their prime !
twice he tried to engrave your fall in gold and twice his hands , a father ’ s hands , fell useless
if the soldier means to finish off our war by force , to rout the trojans now , he should have clashed with me and my weapon then , in combat man to man
famous hippodamia bore the warrior to pirithous that day he wreaked revenge on the shaggy centaurs , routed them out of pelion , drove them to the aethices
down in the ring he threw his pair of gauntlets , massive weights that violent eryx used to sport , binding his fists to fight with rawhide taut and tough
a man will yearn for his fill of all these joys before his fill of war
turnus shakes his head : i don ’ t fear you , you and your blazing threats , my fierce friend
not even ajax held his post , no longer now : forced by the shafts he backed away by inches , certain he would die there — down he leapt from the decks , down to bestride the seven-foot bridge amidships
next the locrians led by racing ajax , son of oileus , little ajax — a far cry from the size of telamonian ajax — a smaller man but trim in his skintight linen corslet , he outthrew all hellenes , all achaeans with his spear
news of the day and acestes ’ famous name had roused the people round about , and a happy crowd had thronged the shore , some to behold aeneas ’ men , some set to compete as well
smooth running rollers we wheel beneath its hoofs , and heavy hempen ropes we bind around its neck , and teeming with men-at-arms the huge deadly engine climbs our city walls
we have hoards inside the walls , the rich dowry old and famous altes presented with his daughter
you phrygians twice enslaved , penned up twice over inside blockaded ramparts , skulking away from death behind your walls !
we are still fighting it , no end in sight , and battling forces we outnumber — by far
a flash of his helmet and off he strode and quickly reached his sturdy , well-built house
will you save me ?
not among men , not among gods , if one 's still left who warms to feasts , his heart at peace , these days
drain to the lees the perils at sea and the whole wide earth while the trojans hunt for latium , hunt for troy reborn !
the team righted , pulled at the reins and again both fighters closed with savage frenzy , dueling now to the death
why did he muster an army , lead us here , that son of atreus ?
all this should obsess you , hector , night and day
they would raised his sleeping chamber , house and court adjoining priam 's and hector 's aloft the city heights
so he ordered , spurring each man 's nerve — and the next moment crowds of trojans once again would have clambered back inside their city walls , terror-struck by the argives primed for battle
but brilliant achilles strode along the surf , crying his piercing cry and roused achaean warriors
that moment zeus awoke on the heights of ida , stretched out by hera , queen of the golden throne — he leapt to his feet , he saw the trojans and achaeans , one side routed , the other harrying them in panic , achaeans attacking , and god poseidon led the way
praying on as aeneas broke in : a far cry from the words you mouthed before— die !
there , awed by the shrine of god , built strong of ancient stone , i begged apollo : grant us our own home , god of thymbra !
her father gave her away , wed for the first time , a virgin still , and these her first solemn rites
so come , all of us celebrate our happy , buoyant rites !
coon was just dragging his brother foot first , wild now to retrieve his own father 's son , calling for help from all the bravest men — but as coon hauled the body through the press agamemnon lunged up , under his bossed shield , thrust home hard with the polished bronze point , unstrung his limbs and reared and lopped his head and the head tumbled onto his fallen brother 's corpse
the raider of cities stood there , scepter in hand , and close beside him the great gray-eyed athena rose like a herald , ordering men to silence
but they have allies called from countless cities , fighters brandishing spears who block my way , who throw me far off course , thwarting my will to plunder ilium 's rugged walls
so it is some god rampaging !
but if he will not obey my orders , if he spurns them , let him beware , heart and soul — for all his power he can never muster the will to stand my onslaught
— doomed to the shortest life of any man on earth
but oileus ' son the racing ajax — not for a moment , not at all would he leave his giant brother ajax , shoulder-to-shoulder they fought together here : close as a brace of wine-dark oxen matched in power , dragging a bolted plow through packed fallow land and the sweat rushes up at the roots of both their horns and only the width of polished yoke keeps both beasts apart , struggling up the furrow to cut the field 's last strip
he struck him right where the midriff packs the pounding heart and down sarpedon fell as an oak or white poplar falls or towering pine that shipwrights up on a mountain hew down with whetted axes for sturdy ship timber — so he stretched in front of his team and chariot , sprawled and roaring , clawing the bloody dust
enraged at that , achilles shouted in mid-stride , you have blocked my way , you distant , deadly archer , deadliest god of all — you made me swerve away from the rampart there
yes but i dread it so — what if great achilles has cut my hector off from the city , daring hector , and driven him out across the plain , and all alone ?
when hector saw no sign of his loyal wife inside he went to the doorway , stopped and asked the servants , come , please , tell me the truth now , women
but enormous pandarus breaks ranks , afire with rage at his brother ’ s death , and shouts : no palace here , your dowry from amata !
so the ghost of my father , so my son declares
a great battle rises before us !
he would never be at the front , smashing our lines unless old thunder , zeus , had put him on his feet
a race i loathe is crossing the tuscan sea , transporting troy to italy , bearing their conquered household gods— thrash your winds to fury , sink their warships , overwhelm them or break them apart , scatter their crews , drown them all !
but god apollo himself spurred on aeneas , taking the build of periphas , summoner 's son who had grown old as herald to aeneas ' father the aged king — a loving , loyal herald too
stupid too , first and last the worst man in the argive armies — stubborn , bullnecked fool
sinon , adept at deceit , with all his greek cunning lifted his hands , just freed from their fetters , up to the stars and prayed : bear witness , you eternal fires of the sky and you inviolate will of the gods !
servants pour them water to rinse their hands , quickly serving them bread from baskets , spreading their laps with linens , napkins clipped and smooth
the dogs and birds will rend you — blood and bone !
then i would face any fate
clearly it 's not my fate to journey home again to the fatherland i love , to bring some joy to my dear wife , my baby son
all the gates flung wide and the trojan mass surged out , horses , chariots , men on foot — a tremendous roar went up
everywhere , black tides of blood , iron clashing , slaughter , fighters striving for death with glory through their wounds
let achilles cut me down straightway — once i have caught my son in my arms and wept my fill !
you alone , she cries , you deserve the virgin !
the epeans ringed that fort , keen to raze its walls , but once their troops had swept the entire plain , down athena rushed to us in the night , a herald down from olympus crying out , to arms !
his mother had borne him along the simois ' banks when she trailed her parents down the slopes of ida to tend their flocks , and so they called him simoisius
now how can you go about this ?
come they did , quickly , two shepherds behind them , playing their hearts out on their pipes — treachery never crossed their minds
a little , not for long
what company you keep now , these wretched trojans
some men hang on billowing crests , some as the sea gapes , glimpse through the waves the bottom waiting , a surge aswirl with sand
dardan skirmishers hand-to-hand — stand by me here !
zeus fitted the armor tightly on hector 's body and ares surged in his heart with awesome force , filling his limbs with power and fighting strength
now , dazzling in all her rich regalia , head to foot , out of her rooms she strode and beckoned aphrodite away from the other gods and whispered , dear child , would you do me a favor
a terrific brazen blast went blaring out from the trumpets far and wide and war cries echo the horns and the high sky resounds
do not think struggle and pain will be ours alone — your day will come to die in blood like him
what good have the syrtes been to me , or scylla or gaping charybdis ?
so the commander ranged achaea 's ranks and brought them into line
testing his men but he only made the spirit race inside their chests , all the rank and file who would never heard his plan
achilles lay there now but he would soon rise up in all his power
these gallant , die-hard trojans , even those i have killed , they will all come rising back from the western gloom !
and he clenches his quarry ’ s flesh as the sopping gore soaks his ruthless maw—just so mezentius pounces hotly onto the enemy masses
come — see if we can arm the achaeans for assault
telamonian ajax voiced frustration first : dear god , enough !
are not you sick of being caged inside those walls ?
now like a flashing eagle swooping down on bird-flocks , winged thousands feeding , swarming a river 's banks , geese , cranes or swans with their long lancing necks — so swooping hector went headfirst at a warship , charged its purple prow , and zeus behind him thrust him on with his mighty , deathless hand , urging the soldiers on who crowded hector 's back
and now the misty phantom , no longer hunting for cover , flutters up on high , dissolving into a dark cloud
no , my soft friends , wretched excuses — women , not men of achaea !
she calls menelaus in and flings the doors wide open , hoping no doubt by this grand gift to him , her lover , to wipe the slate clean of her former wicked ways
yes , well , they know all about that , the argives young and old
what honor will he gain ?
you , caesar , you be first in mercy—you trace your line from olympus— born of my blood , throw down your weapons now !
nevertheless his son was lashing fiery chargers down the level fields , his chariot hurtling virbius into battle
two bars of solid gold shone on the ground before them , a prize for the judge who would speak the straightest verdict
for turnus too , his own fate calls , and the man has reached the end of all his days on earth
a busy , willing servant answered quickly , hector , seeing you want to know the truth , she has not gone to your sisters , brothers ' wives or athena 's shrine where the noble trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over
you scratch my foot and you are vaunting all the same — but who cares ?
when a man ca not catch another fleeing on ahead and he can never escape nor his rival overtake him — so the one could never run the other down in his speed nor the other spring away
i ’ d urge my son to accept , but his blood is mixed , half sabine , thanks to his mother , and so , italian
where god and relentless fortune call us on , that ’ s the way we go !
riding high on our loss the epeans rose in arms , lording over us , harassing us with outrage after outrage
past all other men , all other achaean comrades , we long to be your closest , dearest friends
safe haven after storm wars and a man i sing—an exile driven on by fate , he was the first to flee the coast of troy , destined to reach lavinian shores and italian soil , yet many blows he took on land and sea from the gods above— thanks to cruel juno ’ s relentless rage—and many losses he bore in battle too , before he could found a city , bring his gods to latium , source of the latin race , the alban lords and the high walls of rome
totally spent in war , they ’ d all deserted , down from the roofs they ’ d flung themselves to earth or hurled their broken bodies in the flames
now he would have hauled him off and won undying glory but aphrodite , zeus 's daughter quick to the mark , snapped the rawhide strap , cut from a bludgeoned ox , and the helmet came off empty in menelaus ' fist
so i was the one who raised your empty tomb on rhoeteum cape and called out to your shade three times with a ringing voice
to loot the fallen , one of the fighters ' corpses ?
but the winds scatter them all , all useless , fling them into the clouds
grynean apollo ’ s oracle says that i must seize on italy ’ s noble land , his lycian lots say italy !
or the gracchi and their kin ?
high time you felt at ease with comrades ’ fare
then , quick to the call that cursed trumpet gave , the wild herdsmen gather from every quarter , snatching arms in haste
our side is so much stronger
panthus , where ’ s our stronghold ?
zeus my witness now , hera 's lord whose thunder drums the sky !
he savored every word of nestor 's story
they know their king far off , circling , dancing round him and one , most eloquent of them all , cymodocea swims in on his wake and grips his stern with her right hand , arching her back above the swells as her left hand rows the silent waves , and she calls out to aeneas , lost to it all : awake , aeneas , son of the gods ?
three lives his mother feronia gave him at his birth— i shudder to say it now—three suits of armor for action
but on came greek reserves , no letup , the hail of rocks , the missiles of every kind would never cease
and years ago , propped on his father 's knee , he would only eat the marrow , the richest cuts of lamb , and when sleep came on him and he had quit his play , cradled warm in his nurse 's arms he would drowse off , snug in a soft bed , his heart brimmed with joy
just ask the gods for pardon , win them with offerings
one horse was finished , hit by a shaft that fair-haired helen 's lord , magnificent paris winged at its brow 's high peak where the forelock crowns the skull — most fatal spot
but since i was blinded , lost in my own inhuman rage , now , at last , i am bent on setting things to rights : i will give a priceless ransom paid for friendship
you would never dream he 's come from fighting a man , you would think he 's off to a dance or slipped away from the dancing , stretching out at ease
soon , in a moment , you can have your fill of tears — once i have brought him home
so ran his parting orders , aeneas , best of captains : if any crisis comes while i am away , don ’ t risk a pitched battle , no , don ’ t trust to the open field , just guard the camp and ramparts , safe behind the walls
picus was faunus ’ father , and picus boasted you as his sire , great saturn , you , the founder of the bloodline
enjoy it , all of it — return to your own native land , safe and sound
all he sees is wild , untilled— what men , or what creatures ?
but achilles went for paeonians , helmets plumed , still running in panic along the river 's rapids once they saw their finest fall in the onslaught , beaten down by pelides ' hands and hacking sword
come , now for attack !
pisa placed them at his command , a greek city born by the river alpheus , bred by tuscan soil
till our ships that line the shore go up in flames , gutted , despite a last-ditch stand ?
but now venus is mulling over some new schemes , new intrigues
drances rises , aggressive as always , stung by turnus ’ glory , spurred by smarting , barely hidden envy— a lavish spender , his rhetoric even looser , but a frozen hand in battle
here he glimpses phaedra , procris , and eriphyle grieving , baring the wounds her heartless son had dealt her
all of it false but the king seethed when he heard a tale like that
and the prayers trail after , trying to heal the wounds
the minds of the younger men are always flighty , but let an old man stand his ground among them , one who can see the days behind , the days ahead — that is the best hope for peace , for both our armies
where ’ s his murderous fury ?
the young spearmen will do the work with spears
but shout wherever you go , tell them to stay awake
i see a man — i am afraid we will both be butchered on the spot — into the chariot , hurry !
hermes harnessed the mules and team for both men , drove them fast through the camp and no one saw them
so come , alone as we are , find the best way out : how do we pull the body clear and save ourselves , make it back to our lines and bring our friends some joy ?
now the raw wound saps my strength
there in latium you must battle down a people of wild , rugged ways
why waste your speed ?
the enemy holds our walls
fast as iphiclus was , i raced him to his knees , with a spear i outhurled phyleus , polydorus too
she won ’ t sit tight while fate is turning on its hinge
but the healer applied his pain-killing drugs and sealed hades ' wound — he was not born to die
so the proud father declared to all immortals , 'hear me , all you gods and all goddesses too , as i proclaim what 's brooding deep inside me
even so , patroclus , fight disaster off the ships , fling yourself at the trojans full force — before they gut our hulls with leaping fire and tear away the beloved day of our return
and the torches light the road , searing a long line through flatlands far and wide
in his command sailed forty long black ships
we are the ones who stormed the seven gates of thebes , heading a weaker force and facing stronger walls but obeying the gods ' signs and backed by zeus
she was up in flames at once , engulfed in quenchless fire , in a flash the blaze went swirling round the stern and achilles slapped his thighs and urged patroclus , to arms — patroclus , prince and master horseman !
his beard matted now , his hair clotted with blood , bearing the wounds , so many wounds he suffered fighting round his native city ’ s walls
and now you rampage on among our deep-sea ships , wild to torch our hulls and kill our heroes — well , you will be stopped , somewhere , mad as you are for combat !
but now , at the twelfth dawn since hector 's death , lord apollo rose and addressed the immortal powers : hard-hearted you are , you gods , you live for cruelty !
well , here i sail and begin to build our first walls on the curving shore , though fate will block our way—and i give the town the name of aenus modeled on my own
book eleven : agamemnon 's day of glory
or any gift of the greeks is free of guile ?
achilles ' call rang out and it brought the fastest drivers crowding forward
dread what comrades say of you here in bloody combat !
then at patroclus ' fourth assault like something superhuman , the god shrieked down his winging words of terror : back — patroclus , prince , go back !
you are goddesses , you are everywhere , you know all things — all we hear is the distant ring of glory , we know nothing — who were the captains of achaea ?
altes who rules the leleges always keen for war , who holds the pedasus heights along the satniois — and priam wed his daughter , with many other wives , and she produced two sons , and you , you will butcher both !
ascanius , father anchises , and all the gods of troy , entrusting them to my friends , i hide them well away in a valley ’ s shelter , don my burnished gear and back i go to troy
so that 's the man i was
the white-armed hera beat me !
here the cursed lust for the bull and pasiphaë spread beneath him , duping both her mates , and here the mixed breed , part man , part beast , the minotaur— a warning against such monstrous passion
finally achilles produced a spear that trailed its long shadow , a cauldron too , untouched by fire , chased with flowers and worth an ox , and set them down in the ring
i hope , i pray , if the just gods still have any power , wrecked on the rocks mid-sea you ’ ll drink your bowl of pain to the dregs , crying out the name of dido over and over , and worlds away i ’ ll hound you then with pitch-black flames , and when icy death has severed my body from its breath , then my ghost will stalk you through the world !
now our men are lying mauled on the field — all that hector the son of priam overwhelmed when zeus was handing hector his high glory — but you , you and odysseus urge us to a banquet !
then i was awestruck , stunned by doubt and dread
but the gods who live at ease lashed out against him — worse , the son of cronus struck lycurgus blind
so dido pleads and so her desolate sister takes him the tale of tears again and again
nine heralds shouted out , trying to keep some order , quiet , battalions , silence !
he still ca not block the power of man-killing hector !
vaunting over the dark that swept his quarry 's eyes and the running-rims of argive war-cars cut him to shreds at the onset 's breaking edge
and the swift runner achilles answered quickly , son of menoetius , soldier after my own heart , now i think they will grovel at my knees , our achaean comrades begging for their lives
your achaean comrades , young and old , will exalt you all the more
— hector 's life and his battle-frenzy blotted out by the argives here on hector 's native soil
but the winds bring him a hint of hidden terrors , mingled cries drifting out of the town in chaos
the queen calls for a heavy golden bowl , studded with jewels and brimmed with unmixed wine , the bowl that belus and all of belus ’ sons had brimmed , and the hall falls hushed as dido lifts a prayer : jupiter , you , they say , are the god who grants the laws of host and guest
giant ajax drives them — i recognize the man , that wall of a buckler slung around his shoulders
riding high with latinus ’ gifts and words , aeneas ’ envoys bring back news of peace
thymoetes leads the way
she seated her on a handsome , well-wrought chair , studded with silver , under it slipped a stool and called the famous smith : hephaestus , come — look who 's here !
odysseus quick with tactics answered , courage
scuttling left and right when they saw him down , their chariot captain who would outfought them all
he consults the grove below albunea ’ s heights , where the grand woods resound with a holy spring and exhale their dark , deadly fumes
achilles will listen to you — for his own good
hippothous led the pelasgian tribes of spearmen , fighters who worked larissa 's dark rich plowland
now carved out of the rocky flanks of cumae lies an enormous cavern pierced by a hundred tunnels , a hundred mouths with as many voices rushing out , the sibyl ’ s rapt replies
on the rampart ’ s left wing—the river flanks the right— the hardened troops of aeneas group in battle order , facing enemy lines and manning the broad trench or stationed up on the towers—wrung with sorrow , men stunned by the sight of men they know too well , their heads stuck on pikestaffs dripping gore
now let heralds dear to zeus cry out through the streets of troy that boys in their prime and old gray-headed men must take up posts on the towers built by the gods , in bivouac round the city
i was a fool — i never meant to kill him — quarreling over a dice game
a dark glance — and the headstrong runner answered , no more , old man , do not tempt my wrath , not now !
if mighty zeus , thundering up on high , is bent on wiping out the argives , down to the last man , if he longs to back our trojan forces to the hilt , by heaven i hope the father works his will at once and the argives die here , their memory blotted out , a world away from argos !
but both balked at returning now to the ships moored at the hellespont 's far-reaching shore or galloping back to fight beside the argives
the god of the earthquake swept beside him there and gave the man a burst of winging orders : aeneas — what god on high commands you to play the madman ?
now at dusk she calls for the feast to start again , madly begging to hear again the agony of troy , to hang on his lips again , savoring his story
euaemon 's son eurypylus cut down brave hypsenor , son of lofty dolopion , a man the trojans made scamander 's priest and worshipped like a god
entellus returns : my love of glory , my pride still holds strong , not beaten down by fear
your prizes are yours , said captain aeneas firmly , they all stand fast , young comrades
and prothous son of tenthredon led the magnesians , men who lived around the peneus , up along mount pelion sloped in wind-whipped leaves
themis made her rounds , ranging far and wide and summoned all to march to father 's halls
but even now , late as it is , you could tell your achilles all this and your fiery friend might listen
zeus and poseidon taught you horsemanship , every sort , so there 's no great need for me to set you straight
but devout aeneas now—the last rites performed and the grave-mound piled high—once the seas lie calm , sets sail on his journey , puts the port astern
hector would always call the boy scamandrius , townsmen called him astyanax , lord of the city , since hector was the lone defense of troy
as he turned things over , apollo stood beside him , taking the shape of that lusty rugged fighter asius , an uncle of stallion-breaking hector , a blood brother of hecuba , son of dymas who lived in phrygia near sangarius ' rapids
there we slaughtered fine victims to mighty zeus , a bull to alpheus river , a bull to lord poseidon and an unyoked cow to blazing-eyed athena
fighting epeans over a cattle-raid i killed itymoneus , hypirochus ' gallant son who used to live in elis
from the polished wagon they lifted the priceless ransom brought for hector 's corpse but they left behind two capes and a finely-woven shirt to shroud the body well when priam bore him home
nisus , wild as a starved lion raging through crowded pens as the hunger drives him mad , and he mangles sheep , dumb with terror , rips to shreds their tender flesh and roars from bloody jaws
antiphus hurled at him — the son of priam wearing a gleaming breastplate let fly through the lines but his sharp spear missed and he hit leucus instead , odysseus ' loyal comrade , gouging his groin as the man hauled off a corpse — it dropped from his hands and leucus sprawled across it
i have weapons too , old father , and no weak , untempered spears go flying from my right hand— from the wounds we deal the blood comes flowing too
a mammoth clash — the wide earth roared and the arching vault of heaven echoed round with trumpets !
another thing — take it to heart , i urge you
see porsenna to the life , his likeness menacing , raging , and why ?
rage finds them arms but then , if they chance to see a man among them , one whose devotion and public service lend him weight , they stand there , stock-still with their ears alert as he rules their furor with his words and calms their passion
take your posts through camp
so raced this daughter of night and sped to earth
the immense double gates are flung wide open , greeks in their thousands mass there , all who ever sailed from proud mycenae
they swept in like hounds that fling themselves at a wounded boar before young hunters reach him , darting in for a moment , keen to rip the boar apart till he wheels at bay , ramping into the pack with all his power and the hounds cringe and bolt and scatter left and right
all will end as the omen says , i do believe , if the bird-sign really came to us , the trojans , just as our fighters tried to cross the trench
why prowling among the ships , cut off from camp , alone in the dead of night when other men are sleeping ?
down from the high skies the father of men and gods let loose tremendous thunder — from down below poseidon shook the boundless earth and towering heads of mountains
not for all the world
they will ask that man to every feast and revel
not even i would deny it
but now the war , the deafening crash of battle blazed around the strong-built work , and rampart timbers thundered under the heavy blows as argive fighters beaten down by the lash of zeus were rolled back , pinned to their beaked ships in dread of hector , that invincible headlong terror
out of the field of battle , streaming into town whole troops of herdsmen are bringing home the dead— almo the young boy , galaesus with his butchered face— and they beg the gods for rescue , pleading with latinus
if he lends his name , they ’ ll call the town acesta
and nestor the seasoned charioteer replied , true , atrides , if only i were the man i was , years ago , when i cut down rugged ereuthalion
do not waste your breath
run free , my ships—run , you nymphs of the sea !
look , the pilot palinurus was drifting toward him now , fresh from the libyan run where , watching the stars , he plunged from his stern , pitched out in heavy seas
now , with the ridge of sicily barely out of sight , they spread sail for the open sea , their spirits buoyant , their bronze beaks churning the waves to foam as juno , nursing deep in her heart the everlasting wound , said to herself : defeated , am i ?
turning back to his team , calling , shouting them on : do not hold back , do not stop now — galled as you are — that team in the lead will sag in the leg before you — robbed of their prime , their racing days are done !
not that he will glory in it long , i tell you : his own destruction hovers near him now
why , i clearly had earned the crown for first prize if the same bad luck that leveled salius had not knocked me down !
for the first event , enter , four great ships , well matched with their heavy oars , picked from the whole armada
what divides them all ?
but once they reached the ford where the river runs clear , the strong , whirling xanthus sprung of immortal zeus , achilles split the trojan rout , driving one half back toward the city , scattering up the plain where achaeans themselves stampeded off in terror just the day before when hector raged unchecked
nor did the white-armed hera fail to see anchises ' son advancing there through the press to face achilles
and pallas ’ shield , for all its layers of iron and bronze , its countless layers of oxhide rounding it out for strength—still turnus ’ vibrant spear goes shattering through the shield with stabbing impact , piercing the breastplate ’ s guard and pallas ’ broad chest
bands of sailors , primed for action , leap out onto land—hesperian land
why make us lords of estates along the xanthus ' banks , rich in vineyards and plowland rolling wheat ?
but odysseus stepped in quickly , faced him down with a dark glance and threats to break his nerve : what a flood of abuse , thersites !
now , at last , the neck of troy 's in the noose — her doom is sealed
holding fast in his grip a lightning bolt he drove iris down in a rush of golden wings to bear his message : away with you now , iris — quick as the wind and speed this word to hector
three times tydides was tempted , heart and soul , three times from the crags of ida zeus let loose his thunder , the master strategist handing down a sign to the trojans — victory thunder turning the tide of war their way
just as he lunged i speared the man with a bronze lance and mulius pitched in the dust as i , i swung aboard his car and i took my place in our front ranks of champions
but now , my comrades , seeing the best part of the day is done , for the rest , refresh yourselves , hearts high
the armies prayed and stretched their hands to the gods
that woman , that vagrant !
whatever we dragged from towns we plundered , all 's been portioned out
where is the bow that god apollo gave you ?
and turnus too : track down the roots of his house and who are his forebears ?
the crowd springs up , sicilians , trojans , rival outcries hit the sky
drag them down to the bright sea !
what do i do now ?
i ’ m here to implore you now : pity your own people
all men and gods , in wisdom clear and calm — but all this brutal carnage comes from you
better to slaughter seven bulls from a herd unbroken by the yoke , as the old rite requires , and as many head of teething yearling sheep
on that note both men harnessed up in the grim gear of war
die , trojans , die — till i butcher all the way to sacred troy — run headlong on , i will hack you from behind !
then when the dawn 's red fingers shine in all their glory , quickly deploy your chariots and battalions , agamemnon , out in front of the ships — you spur them on and you yourself , you fight in the front ranks !
his prayer went up and phoebus apollo heard him
aeneas knows nothing , the man is miles away ’ ?
my mother , of priam ’ s ancient stock—poor woman !
and tall hector nodded , his helmet flashing : all this weighs on my mind too , dear woman
then too latinus was pressed to declare war on aeneas ’ sons with the same custom , to unbar the deadly gates
and when at a distance she could see— clear in the thick of battle , war cries , warriors ’ fury— camilla beaten down by the brutal stroke of death , she moaned , crying out from the bottom of her heart : too cruel , dear girl , too cruel the price you pay for trying , begging to challenge the men of troy in combat !
go sing that song , you fool , for the trojan chief—your own prospects too
how young you are
with that , at least , i consoled myself for troy ’ s demise , that heartrending ruin—weighing fate against fate
his combed , flowing beard spreading across his chest , he tries to limber his neck , panting , heaving in torment
with that he heaved up from the anvil block — his immense hulk hobbling along but his shrunken legs moved nimbly
but sarpedon the lycian captain faced him down : right you are , tlepolemus !
here came to an end the games in honor of aeneas ’ hallowed father
the rutulian king and the latin captains marvel till , glancing back , they see an armada heading toward the shore and the whole sea rolling down on them now in a tide of ships
still in retreat , turnus , why ?
you must surrender helen and all her treasure with her
there 's no achieving our mission here , i see , not with this approach
one ship that carried the lycian units led by staunch orontes— before aeneas ’ eyes a toppling summit of water strikes the stern and hurls the helmsman overboard , pitching him headfirst , twirling his ship three times , right on the spot till the ravenous whirlpool gulps her down
rescued zeus , the lord of the dark storm cloud , from ignominious , stark defeat
from there he leads aeneas on to tarpeia ’ s house and the capitol , all gold now but once in the old days , thorny , dense with thickets
she had seen how thetis , the old man of the sea 's daughter , thetis quick on her glistening feet was hatching plans with zeus
with fresh zeal aeneas resumes his father ’ s rites , wondering , is the serpent the genius of the place ?
no shame in the man , shame that does great harm or drives men on to good
but if words of mine could lure them back to love , back to bed , to lock in each other 's arms once more
cries of terror breaking as trojans choked all roads , their lines ripped to pieces , up from under the hoofs a dust storm swirling into the clouds as rearing horses broke into stride again and galloped back to troy , leaving ships and shelters in their wake
nor does aeneas flag , though slowed down by his wound , his knees unsteady , cutting his pace at times but he ’ s still in full fury , hot on his frantic quarry ’ s tracks , stride for stride
and glaucus next
the deadly archer loves his trojans dearly
whatever it is , i fear the greeks , especially bearing gifts
so , driven by madness , beaten down by anguish , dido was fixed on dying , working out in her mind the means , the moment
god drove me to your shores
come , achilles , no more bragging on this way like boys , standing here in the thick of a pitched battle
what if you are a great soldier ?
i will soon see if the mighty diomedes rams me back from the ships and back against our walls or i kill him with bronze and strip his bloody armor !
quickly cloaking herself in shimmering linen , out of her rooms she rushed , live tears welling , and not alone — two of her women followed close behind , aethra , pittheus ' daughter , and clymene , eyes wide , and they soon reached the looming scaean gates
if not , no strength within you can overpower it , no iron blade , however hard , can tear it off
grieved as you are , bear up , or dear as you are , i have to see you beaten right before my eyes
the silver hubs spin round on either side of the chariot 's woven body , gold and silver lashings strapping it tight , double rails sweeping along its deep full curves and the yoke-pole jutting forward , gleaming silver
so ajax vaunted , knowing his victim full well , and a raw revulsion seized the trojans ' hearts
victory shifts , you know , now one man , now another
no need for such an outburst — get a grip on yourself , distraught as you are
and men will forget those ramparts i and apollo reared for troy in the old days — for the hero laomedon — we broke our backs with labor
disgraced my horsemanship — you have fouled my horses , cutting before me , you with your far slower team
and rallying other gods around her , hera shouted , bend to the work , you two , poseidon , athena , decide in your hearts how this assault will go !
caedicus chops alcathous down—sacrator , hydaspes— rapo kills parthenius , then the indestructible orses
for the man we cut down here was the loyal friend of prince achilles — far the greatest among the argive ships and at his command go rugged fighters hand-to-hand
first he wrapped his legs with the well-made greaves , fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps , next he strapped the breastplate round his chest , blazoned with stars — swift achilles ' own — then over his shoulder patroclus slung the sword , the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt , and then the shield-strap and the sturdy , massive shield and over his powerful head he set the well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror , and he took two rugged spears that fit his grip
but turnus flying on ahead of his slower column , flanked by a picked troop of twenty horsemen , gains the town in no time , borne by a thracian charger blazed with white , and helmed in his golden casque with crimson crest
one man is a splendid fighter — a god has made him so — one 's a dancer , another skilled at lyre and song , and deep in the next man 's chest farseeing zeus plants the gift of judgment , good clear sense
a god impels all things to their fulfillment : ruin , eldest daughter of zeus , she blinds us all , that fatal madness — she with those delicate feet of hers , never touching the earth , gliding over the heads of men to trap us all
ah , but old age , sluggish , cold , played out with the years , has me in its grip , denies me the command
did he groan when i wept ?
in the same breath , blazing with wrath he plants his iron sword hilt-deep in his enemy ’ s heart
ajax lunged at the man , he struck his shield but the point would not pierce through , so he beat him back in rage and he edged away from the breastwork just a yard
teucer the master archer rose to meet the challenge , meriones joined him , idomeneus ' rough-and-ready aide
so off you go now
shipmates furl the sails and swing the prows toward land
there ’ s hope for peace as well
your naked corpse will lie on an unknown shore
rhipeus , dymas too and our corps of young recruits—each fighter arms himself in the loot that he just seized and on we forge , blending in with the enemy , battling time and again under strange gods , fighting hand-to-hand in the blind dark and many greeks we send to the king of death
my own son hephaestus , the burly crippled smith will forge it finely and under it slide a stool where you can prop your glistening feet and rest , stretching out at feasts
and with that command queen hera strode home and regained her throne
each man he would stand above and chop with the sword , the cool tactician odysseus grappled from behind , grabbing the fighter 's heels , dragging him out of the way with one thought in mind : that team with their flowing manes must get through fast , not quake at heart and balk , trampling over the dead , those purebred horses still not used to corpses
and beside each a brace of stallions standing poised and pawing , champing their oats and barley glistening white
the silver cave was shimmering full of sea-nymphs , all in one mounting chorus beating their breasts as thetis launched the dirge : hear me , sisters , daughters of nereus , so you all will know it well — listen to all the sorrows welling in my heart !
better to clash in battle , now , at once — see which fighter zeus awards the glory !
atreus ’ sons , they ’ re not alone in suffering such a wound , not only mycenae has a right to go to war
— till you can make your raid and test my story , see if i have told the truth or i have been lying
they closed ranks , they packed like a stone wall , a granite cliff that towers against the churning surf , standing up to the screaming winds , their sudden assaults and the breaking waves they spawn that crash against its base — so the danaans stood the trojan onslaught , rock-solid and never flinched in fear
he would bolted golden wheels to the legs of each so all on their own speed , at a nod from him , they could roll to halls where the gods convene then roll right home again — a marvel to behold
oh the two of us !
they mixed the contenders ' wine in a large bowl and rinsed the warlords ' waiting hands with water
there was a vast cave deep in the gaping , jagged rock , shielded well by a dusky lake and shadowed grove
but the butcher did see tydeus ' rugged son and he dropped gigantic periphas on the spot where he would just killed him , ripped his life away and ares whirled at the stallion-breaking diomedes — the two of them closing fast , charging face-to-face and the god thrust first , over tydides ' yoke and reins , with bronze spear burning to take the fighter 's life
well i know you are brave , and i am far weaker
throughout the house his daughters and sons ' wives wailed , remembering all the fine brave men who lay dead now , their lives destroyed at the fighting argives ' hands
the plans of zeus will never bring them off , those dreams of glory inspiring hector now
now , the turn itself — it 's clear , you can not miss it
then we would have done with fighting long ago , razed the rugged walls of troy and laid her waste
who could maim you so ?
another achaean armed in bronze may well be blind to the way i fight
with that he hurled a heavy lance at the great and awesome shield and its massive surface clanged as it took the point
and so under shelter now menoetius ' fighting son was healing eurypylus ' wounds
his slashing sword had already hacked off anxur ’ s left arm and his round buckler slammed the ground
hector caught his breath and his eyes cleared , he crouched down on his knees to vomit dark clots then slumped back down , stretched on the ground again and the world went black as night across his eyes
and all the woodcutters hoisted logs themselves — by command of idomeneus ' good aide meriones — and they heaved them down in rows along the beach at the site achilles chose to build an immense mound for patroclus and himself
and down she sat on her father 's lap , a young girl , sobbing , her deathless robe quivering round her body
why , not even i would rail against that man , that worthless coward who cringes from the fighting
swear you will do the same
that time you vaunted you were the finest force on earth — all that empty bluster you let fly at lemnos , gorging yourselves on longhorn cattle meat and drunk to the full on brimming bowls of wine , bragging how each man could stand up to a hundred , no , two hundred trojan fighters in pitched battle
now his shield took powerful agamemnon 's spear but failed to deflect it , straight through it smashed , bronze splitting his belt and plunging down his guts — he fell , thundering , armor ringing against him
at tarchon ’ s command his shipmates rise to their oars and drive their vessels foaming onto the latian shore until their beaks have gripped dry land , all keels beached safe and sound , all but your own ship , tarchon
trying to lift the soldier 's heart with stories , applying soothing drugs to his dreadful wound as he sought to calm the black waves of pain
but the father paid no heed to them
no , go boast to your heart 's content and tell the gods you triumphed over me with your superhuman power !
but all the rest of you , come , all achaeans in camp who trust to your teams and bolted chariots — take your places now !
not even the stretch of beach , broad as it was , could offer berths to all that massed armada , troops were crammed in a narrow strip of coast
so you can not challenge my birth as low , cowardly , or spurn the advice i give , if the plan is really sound
the tambourines , they ’ re calling for you now , and the boxwood flutes of your berecynthian mother perched on ida !
the tallest trunk there was on the heights of ida , it pierced the low-hung mist and shot up through the sky
enough of this madness — striving with the gods
give ground , but faces fronting the trojans always — no use trying to fight the gods in force
all flocked to the halls of zeus who gathers storms and found their seats in the colonnades of polished stone hephaestus built for father zeus with all his craft and cunning
out of his rich guarded chamber the god himself launched aeneas now , driving courage into his heart and the captain took his place amidst his men
and thetis answered , bursting into tears , o my son , my sorrow , why did i ever bear you ?
he left his armored men along the asopus banks and carried a peaceful word to theban cohorts crowded in their halls
and a thirteenth man besides , a scout we took — prowling along the ships , spying on our positions — hector and all his princely trojans sent him out
quickly , you and meriones shoulder up the body , carry it off the lines
agamemnon the lord of men did not resist
you ’ re dead set on my paying such a price ?
that moment , rumor , flown through the shaken camp , wings the news to the ears of euryalus ’ mother
then , when brilliant achilles had had his fill of tears and the longing for it had left his mind and body , he rose from his seat , raised the old man by the hand and filled with pity now for his gray head and gray beard , he spoke out winging words , flying straight to the heart : poor man , how much you have borne — pain to break the spirit !
i will give him a chariot , two horses with strong necks , the best of the breeds beside achaea 's fast ships
and five full circles they run and reel as many back , around and back , for it ’ s no mean trophy they ’ re sporting after now , they race for the life and the lifeblood of turnus
did it please you so , great jove , to see the world at war , the peoples clash that would later live in everlasting peace ?
before it rears a giant gate , its columns solid adamant , so no power of man , not even the gods themselves can root it out in war
now as we held our son between our hands and both our grieving faces , a tongue of fire , watch , flares up from the crown of iulus ’ head , a subtle flame licking his downy hair , feeding around the boy ’ s brow , and though it never harmed him , panicked , we rush to shake the flame from his curls and smother the holy fire , damp it down with water
a man who can cut out shafts and dress our wounds — a good healer is worth a troop of other men
since fortune ’ s got the upper hand , let ’ s follow her where she calls and change course
but once the olympians merged with mortal fighters , strife the mighty driver of armies rose in strength and athena bellowed her stunning war cry — standing now at the edge of the deep-dug trench outside the rampart , now at thundering cliffs she loosed her vibrant cry
not a single god or mortal , only thetis and eurynome knew — they saved me
but now , since i shall not return to my fatherland
their power 's enormous — one 's a master archer , pandarus , son of lycaon , so he boasts
they stood in a row
the most that valor could do , valor has done
i salute your ashes , your spirit and your shade—my father i rescued once , but all for nothing
— he will return them all and add from his own stores
i pray that the earth gape deep enough to take me down or the almighty father blast me with one bolt to the shades , the pale , glimmering shades in hell , the pit of night , before i dishonor you , my conscience , break your laws
father anchises calls out , land of welcome , that ’ s what you bring us , true , horses are armed for war , these pairs of horses threaten war
he 's just in the first flush of youth , what 's more , the greatest power of all
they are making a splendid sacrifice to the gods — i must not miss my share of the sacred feast
you too assume a captain ’ s joint command
bound by custom he slaughters a pair of yearling sheep , as many swine and a brace of young steers with their sleek black backs , then tipping wine from the bowls , he calls his father ’ s ghost , set free from acheron now , the great anchises ’ shade
raze them — whenever they stir the hatred in your heart
there are twin gates of sleep
with that he called his henchmen rout and terror to yoke his team as the god strapped on his shining gear
hecuba went down to a storeroom filled with scent and there they were , brocaded , beautiful robes
fight for your country — that is the best , the only omen !
oh but if zeus 's lightning blinded us those days , it 's zeus who drives us , hurls us on today !
the rampart 's down , there , the great wall we trusted , our impregnable shield for the ships and men themselves
kill us all in the light of day at least — since killing 's now your pleasure !
nothing they did could thrust him off their lines , prince hector roaring on like a torch — not even the picked athenians led by menestheus , peteos ' son and backing him came phidas , stichius , brave bias , then the epean units led by meges , phyleus ' son , amphion , dracius , and leading the phthian ranks came medon flanking podarces tough in skirmish
the man who would struck him down was not the weakest argive
another , numitor , wrenching out the shaft from his brother ’ s body , went at aeneas , praying to hit him , pay him back but not a chance of that—he could only graze the stalwart achates in the thigh
aeneas himself , sword drawn , slaughters a black-fleeced lamb to the furies ’ mother , night , and to her great sister , earth , and to you , proserpina , kills a barren heifer
many others afield are much taller , true , but i have never yet set eyes on one so regal , so majestic
no other achaean fighter could heft that shaft , only achilles had the skill to wield it well : pelian ash it was , a gift to his father peleus presented by chiron once , hewn on pelion 's crest to be the death of heroes
the shield-belt glinted silver and rippling on it ran a dark blue serpent , two heads coiling round a third , reared from a single neck and twisting left and right
now our whole army is no match for one , for hector — he will gut our ships with blazing fire at any moment !
men like pirithous , dryas , that fine captain , caeneus and exadius , and polyphemus , royal prince , and theseus , aegeus ' boy , a match for the immortals
and round camilla ride her elite companions , tulla , young larina , tarpeia brandishing high her brazen axe— daughters of italy , all , she chose to be her glory , godlike camilla ’ s aides in peace and war and wild as thracian amazons galloping , pounding along the thermodon ’ s banks , fighting in burnished gear around hippolyte , or when penthesilea born of mars comes sweeping home in her car , an army of women lifts their rolling , shrilling cries in welcome , exulting with half-moon shields
oh , child of heartbreak !
here are the pools where numicus ’ springs rise and here is the tiber river , here the hardy latins make their homes
deep in the sea she dove from radiant mount olympus
and with those words the goddess filled her heart with yearning warm and deep for her husband long ago , her city and her parents
who was the first they slaughtered , who the last , the brazen god of war and hector son of priam ?
my spirit rebels — i have lost the will to live , to take my stand in the world of men — unless , before all else , hector 's battered down by my spear and gasps away his life , the blood-price for patroclus , menoetius ' gallant son he 's killed and stripped !
look — what a mighty piece of work he 's done without me !
he closed with a shout and fired each fighter 's heart and down in a mass they launched against the trojans , ships around them echoing back their shattering cries
pain for achaeans , enough to last us down the years to come
and the many tribes report to join the dardan chief and his name rings far and wide through latian country
you with your coward 's heart , your men dying round you !
and he hangs his head low , humiliated in every way
achilles suddenly loosed a terrible , wrenching cry and his noble mother heard him , seated near her father , the old man of the sea in the salt green depths , and she cried out in turn
iris the wind-quick messenger hurried down to ilium , bearing her painful message , sent by storming zeus
they were enraged , they maimed him , they ripped away his voice , the rousing immortal wonder of his song and wiped all arts of harping from his mind
welcome , rousing words , and achaeans-at-arms roared out with joy to hear the greathearted achilles swearing off his rage
but teeming with treachery noble hera set her trap , 'you will prove a liar
even from the start of his declaration , she has glared at him askance , her eyes roving over him , head to foot , with a look of stony silence
three times i had to lay him low but my right hand , my right hand then , stripped him of all his lives and all his armor too !
so menelaus thrilled at heart — princely paris there , right before his eyes
isn ’ t that how the phrygian shepherd breached sparta and carried leda ’ s helen off to the towns of troy ?
you will hang your head in shame — every day of your life — if the argives strip my armor here at the anchored ships where i have gone down fighting
the genealogy of the royal house of troyno , wrapped in flames i would be up on the front lines , dragging the trojan into mortal combat
first you are , when you hear of feasts from me , when achaeans set out banquets for the chiefs
it 's not so much from anger or outrage at our people that i keep to my rooms so long
no , again and again you vowed you would make me godlike achilles ' lawful , wedded wife , you would sail me west in your warships , home to phthia and there with the myrmidons hold my marriage feast
but let them both bear witness to my loss
you are my child
if only they hated most all womankind so deeply !
so come , follow my orders
i say go back to the fighting , wounded as we are — we must , we have no choice
rejoice , relay our message , certain beyond all doubt , to your father full of years
we will put up another champion to go against this hector
so the voice of the king rang out in tears , the citizens wailed in answer , and noble hecuba led the wives of troy in a throbbing chant of sorrow : o my child — my desolation !
child of zeus with the shield of thunder , why come now ?
shattered , helpless , posted high on the turrets , girding walls with a thin defensive ring are asius , son of imbrasus , thymoetes , hicetaon ’ s son , the assaraci twins and castor with aged thymbris up in front : behind them , both sarpedon ’ s brothers , clarus and thaemon , new allies from lycia ’ s highlands
just to see the enemy camped in the very heart of our house , to see my son , ascanius , see my father , my wife , creusa , with them , sacrificed , massacred in each other ’ s blood ?
forward he ranged the charioteers with teams and cars , backed by infantry close behind them , milling , brave men , the defensive line of battle — that would be their role
and he leapt himself at the fighting driver 's corpse with the rushing lunge of a lion struck in the chest as he lays waste pens of cattle — his own lordly courage about to be his death
enough— allecto ignited in rage
a crack spearman — laomedon 's grandson , lampus ' big and brawny son , the strongest he sired , the best trained for assault — dolops quickly went for meges at close range , he speared his bulging shield but the solid breastplate warded off the blow with both plates fitted tight to bind his body
not even in death do their torments leave them , ever
put heads together — what shall we do now ?
but wait , i will bring you some honeyed , mellow wine
juno loved it , they say , beyond all other lands in the world , even beloved samos , second best
still he whipped an arrow high in the lofting air to display his seasoned art and make his bow ring out
three times he probed each way , three times juno with all her power held the prince ’ s fury down , pitying him in her heart , and kept him hard on course , cutting the deep as favoring tide and current sweep him home to his father daunus ’ ancient city
they received me from rhea , when thundering zeus drove cronus under the earth and the barren salt sea
the enemy ’ s sunken deep in sleep and wine , dead to the world
for the armies ' good the seer began to speak : achilles , dear to zeus
now , if the latin people must seek a son of strangers ’ stock , if that is fixed in stone and your father faunus ’ orders press you hard , well then i ’ d say all countries free of our rule are total strangers
the natural thing , my lord , men and women joined
today , either you ’ ll carry back those bloody arms we strip in triumph , parade aeneas ’ head and avenge together lausus ’ pains
now how can a trojan victory hinge on me ?
but you , you powers above , and you , jupiter , highest lord of the gods : pity , i implore you , a king of arcadia , hear a father ’ s prayers !
never scorn the gods
no hiding ourselves away in a horse ’ s blind dark flanks
when young dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more , they set sail for the main encampment of achaea
what have you to fear ?
turnus , truly beside himself with terror—faunus !
then the trojans throw themselves in the labor , launching their tall vessels down along the beach and the hull rubbed sleek with pitch floats high again
to you alone he used to listen , the traitor , to you confide his secret feelings
the son of tydeus killed the two of them on the spot , he ripped the dear life out of both and left their father tears and wrenching grief
and aphrodite who loves eternal laughter sobbed in answer , the son of tydeus stabbed me , diomedes , that overweening , insolent — all because i was bearing off my son from the fighting
well ahead of the war-cars they reached the brink , closed ranks as drivers backed them yards behind
to stand up bravely , always to fight in the front ranks of trojan soldiers , winning my father great glory , glory for myself
your friend , your sister , you scorn me now in death ?
these he will give , and along with them will go the one he took away at first , briseus ' daughter , and he will swear a solemn , binding oath in the bargain : he never mounted her bed , never once made love with her
there they loom in the gateway , left and right like towers , armored in iron , crests on their high heads flaring— tall as a pair of oaks along a stream in spate , by the po ’ s banks or the adige ’ s lovely waters , rearing their uncropped heads to the high sky , their twin crowns waving tall
tyrrhus rallies his troops , he ’ s just been splitting an oak in four with wedges ; now , breathing fury , he seizes a woodsman ’ s axe
where are we to settle ?
suddenly , in the heart of the woods , his mother crossed his path
oh but i , powerful juno , wife of jove , wretched juno , i endured it all , left nothing undared , i stooped to any tactic , still he defeats me—aeneas !
bend to your sturdy oars ! — and setting canvas aslant to work the wind , he calls out to his captain : great-hearted aeneas , no , not even if jove himself would pledge me with all his power , could i dream of reaching italy under skies like these
the death that each man dreaded turned to the fate of one poor soul : a burden they could bear
but not even then did hector quit the battle
he excelled all men in wealth and pride of place , he lorded the myrmidons , and mortal that he was , they gave the man an immortal goddess for a wife
son of a god , he will bring back the age of gold to the latian fields where saturn once held sway , expand his empire past the garamants and the indians to a land beyond the stars , beyond the wheel of the year , the course of the sun itself , where atlas bears the skies and turns on his shoulder the heavens studded with flaming stars
you two were busy over the carcass , carving meat when we both appeared and stood at the broad doors
calling out to the vision , zeus winged it on : go , murderous dream , to the fast achaean ships and once you reach agamemnon 's shelter rouse him , order him , word-for-word , exactly as i command
at that , queen juno looses her fury , bursting out : why drive me to break my deep silence , to open up my wounds , long scarred over , and bruit them to the world ?
and then , when the toddler had taken her first hesitant steps , metabus armed her hand with a well-honed lance and slung from her tiny shoulder bow and arrows
then to the king of the river styx , he raises altars into the dark night and over their fires lays whole carcasses of bulls and pours fat oil over their entrails flaming up
the famous spearman idomeneus crossed his path — he would come from a friend who just emerged from battle gashed in back of the kneecap , gouged by whetted bronze
ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , glory !
the argives poured against them , back by the hollow hulls , the din of battle incessant — an argive breakthrough — bright as the moment zeus the lord of lightning moves from a craggy mountain ridge a storm cloud massing dense and all the lookout peaks stand out and the jutting cliffs and the steep ravines and down from the high heavens bursts the boundless bright air
but here , achilles , accept this glorious armor , look , a gift from the god of fire — burnished bright , finer than any mortal has ever borne across his back !
only i — my hardened courage drove me to fight the man in a hot burst of daring , and i the youngest trooper of us all
and sighting odysseus next the old king questioned helen , come , dear child , tell me of that one too — now who is he ?
i will take him on myself , see who he is who routs us , wreaking havoc against us — cutting the legs from under squads of good brave men
courage , come , take heart !
i dread your grim commands
dido and troy ’ s commander make their way to the same cave for shelter now
and adding kills , she takes amastrus , hippotas ’ son , then attacking at long range , with spearcasts pierces tereus and harpalycus , then demophoön , chromis too and for every shaft the girl let fly from her hand another phrygian fighter bit the dust
that is the blood i claim , my royal birth
in hopes of ruling your stallion-breaking friends and filling priam 's throne ?
ten bands of blue enamel spanned it , spaced by twelve of gold and twenty of beaten tin and dark blue serpents writhed toward the throat , three each side , shimmering bright as rainbows arched on the clouds by cronus ' son , a sign to mortal men
no more delay , putting off the work the god puts in our hands
grant that achilles will receive me with kindness , mercy
then , at last , he hurtles into the thick of battle as mars drives him on , and terrible , savage , inciting slaughter , sparing none , he gives his rage free rein
the thought of my own dear father filled my mind when i saw the old king gasping out his life with that raw wound—both men were the same age— and the thought of my creusa , alone , abandoned , our house plundered , our little iulus ’ fate
come , relax your anger
but at once paris the lord of fair-haired helen drew his bow at the rugged captain diomedes
and the cry pierced menelaus , deeply torn now as he probed his own great heart : what can i do ?
but the argives faced them , standing fast in a ring around patroclus , one fury seizing their hearts , packing a wall of bronze shields and round about their glittering crested helmets now the son of cronus spread a dense , deepening mist
both men bent on combat , on they fought like wind when a god sends down some welcome blast to sailors desperate for it , worked to death at the polished oars , beating the heavy seas , their arms slack with the labor — so welcome that brace of men appeared to the trojans desperate for their captains
revere her power and she will grant safe passage
and here came nestor with orders ringing down the field : my comrades — fighting danaans , aides of ares — no plunder now !
vicious quarrels are deadly — put an end to them , at once
meanwhile aeneas is plowing out the city limits , assigning homes by lot
now , by heaven , i will arm and go to war
and thetis did not forget her son 's appeals
across from him patroclus sat alone , in silence , waiting for aeacus ' son to finish with his song
and zeus 's son sarpedon rejoiced to see him striding past and begged him in his pain , son of priam , do not leave me lying here , such easy prey for the danaans — protect me !
so runs the doom of zeus
wave on wave of them settling , close ranks shuddering into a dense , bristling glitter of shields and spears and helmets — quick as a ripple the west wind suddenly risen shudders down the sea and the deep sea swell goes dark beneath its force — so settling waves of trojan ranks and achaeans rippled down the plain
and the lord of men agamemnon came in last of all , weighed down by the wound he took in the rough charge when coon , son of antenor , slashed his arm with bronze
but all the while the rest of the trojans fled en masse , thrilled to reach the ramparts , crowding , swarming in , no daring left to remain outside the city walls and wait for each other , learn who made it through , who died in battle — no , in a driving rout they came , streaming into troy , any fighter whose racing legs could save his life
time and again you ’ ve heard his coming promised—caesar augustus !
they hold me off at a distance , all the souls , the shades of the burnt-out , breathless dead , never to let me cross the river , mingle with them
don ’ t let your corrosive grief devour you in silence , or let your dire concerns come pouring from your sweet lips and plaguing me forever
and the golden drovers kept the herd in line , four in all , with nine dogs at their heels , their paws flickering quickly — a savage roar !
one stir of the scent in the bronze-floored halls of zeus and a perfumed cloud would drift from heaven down to earth
so come , my boys , in honor of his heroic exploits crown your hair with leaves , hold high your cups , invoke the god we share with our new allies , offer him wine with all your eager hearts
dismayed by the signs , the king seeks out the oracle of faunus , his vatic father
they will never hold me back in my onslaught now , with a bound my team will leap that trench they dug
but she passed the rest and took a cup from themis , flushed with beauty , who ran to meet her first and hailed her now with winged words of welcome : hera , what brings you back ?
dead silence all around
a commission of yours taught me my lesson once , the day that heracles , the insolent son of zeus sailed out from troy , having razed her to the ground
they met on their feet
you can change an armada into sea-nymphs , yes , but if we in our turn offer the latin side a helping hand , is that such a horrid crime ?
always beside odysseus — just like the man 's mother , rushing to put his rivals in the dust
the gods who shored our empire up have left us , all have deserted their altars and their shrines
no more now — back i go to phthia
and worse still , the greeks roaring with anger—we had saved cassandra— attack us from all sides !
come , put your head down , steal some rest for your eyes worn out from labor
so standing tall , with their arms and fighting hearts refreshed— one who trusted all to his sword , the other looming fiercely with his spear—confronting each other , both men breathless , brace for the war-god ’ s fray
look at the heroes who ’ d seize our brides in battle !
and so he saved them all from the fatal day , he gave way to his own feelings , but too late
over there , where the massed infantry pushes forward , that ’ s where your famous land demands you back with pallas in the lead
he mounted his car at once as asclepius ' son , machaon born of the famous healer swung aboard
so mezentius now , for all his attackers ’ rightful fury , none of them has the spine to fight him , swords drawn , they just bait him with missiles , far-flung cries , all at a safe remove
is this what your pyre meant for me—this , your fires—this , your altars ?
aeneas spurs his men in the forefront of their labors , geared with the same woodsmen ’ s tools around his waist
all fell hushed , their eyes fixed on aeneas now as the founder of his people , high on a seat of honor , set out on his story : sorrow , unspeakable sorrow , my queen , you ask me to bring to life once more , how the greeks uprooted troy in all her power , our kingdom mourned forever
he broke off and anguish gripped achilles
thetis saved my life when the mortal pain came on me after my great fall , thanks to my mother 's will , that brazen bitch , she wanted to hide me — because i was a cripple
but other soldiers kept on flailing , cutting each other to pieces , the tough bronze casing their bodies clanging out , fighters stabbing with swords , flinging two-edged spears
first adrestus , then autonous , then echeclus , then perimus , megas ' son , epistor and melanippus , then in a flurry elasus , mulius and pylartes — he killed them all but the rest were bent on flight
you ’ d never think such a throng of men in bronze were massing for battle now , but high in the sky a cloud of birds with their raucous song were surging home from open sea to shore
but coon marked him , coon , antenor 's eldest son , a distinguished man-at-arms , and stinging grief went misting down his eyes for his fallen brother
seems to me it 's a new team out in front , a new driver as well , just coming into sight
shall i tell you of neoptolemus ’ brief reign ?
the hero seized his foot , dragging him through the rout
i have no use for trophies
but now as the twelfth dawn after this shone clear the gods who live forever marched home to olympus , all in a long cortege , and zeus led them on
i am no stranger to you
now let ajax take this victory , shining triumph !
now let those win out
the men of argos exulted at the sight of him there but terrible tremors shook each trojan fighter 's knees — hector himself , his heart pounding against his ribs
through fires , a thousand menacing spears i swept him off on these shoulders , saved him from our enemies ’ onslaught
so they roused each other , exulting in the fire , the joy of battle the god excited in their hearts
oh i will stop — if that is your command — but let your son stop too !
what shores do you come from ?
two bowls of unmixed wine he tips on the ground and two of fresh milk , two more of hallowed blood , then scatters crimson flowers with this prayer : hail , my blessed father , hail again !
the herald eumelus runs the news to crowds wedged in the theater round anchises ’ tomb— even they can see the black cloud churn with sparks
but you , patroclus , you would not let me weep , not when the swift achilles cut my husband down , not when he plundered the lordly mynes ' city — not even weep !
for the loser he led a woman through their midst , worth four , they thought , and skilled in many crafts
the sister , silvia , she is the first to call for rescue , hands beating her arms , summoning hardy rustics
but before i have to see my city annihilated , laid waste before my eyes — oh let me go down to the house of death !
his enemies massing round him , trying to drive him back , left , right but he keeps charging , harder , swirling his lightning sword till facing volcens , he sinks his blade in his screaming mouth— nisus dying just as he stripped his enemy of his life
beat the merciless day of death from ajax , overpowered , look , by a pelting rain of spears
first of the two to know the god was rapid ajax
it ’ s savagery , swordplay cut-and-thrust !
never sated with shattering war cries , are you ?
do his father aeneas and uncle hector fire his heart with the old courage , his heroic forebears ’ spirit ?
if i ever reach the tiber , the fields on tiber ’ s banks , and see my people secure behind their promised walls , then of our neighboring kin and kindred cities , both in epirus and hesperia—both have the same founder , dardanus , the same fate too—someday we will make our peoples one , one troy in heart and soul
but troy and her soaring ramparts were not standing yet , the people lived in valleys , deep in lowlands
the hounds shrank from sinking teeth in the lions , they balked , hunching close , barking , cringing away
not even then would the stark grief for heracles release my breaking heart — my own godlike son
and all those left alive , after the hateful carnage , remember food and drink — so all the more fiercely we can fight our enemies , nonstop , no mercy , durable as the bronze that wraps our bodies
a hundred years they wander , hovering round these shores till at last they may return and see once more the pools they long to cross
and there in the midst the king , scepter in hand at the head of the reaping-rows , stood tall in silence , rejoicing in his heart
and even if i were willing , would the trojans allow me to board their proud ships— a woman they hate ?
how shameful for you , the high and mighty commander , to lead the sons of achaea into bloody slaughter !
i would not be surprised , my queen , if you were the first to reap the pernicious whirlwind you have sown — i will whip you stroke on stroke
as a garden poppy , burst into red bloom , bends , drooping its head to one side , weighed down by its full seeds and a sudden spring shower , so gorgythion 's head fell limp over one shoulder , weighed down by his helmet
a last request — grant it , please
grant this boy , my son , may be like me , first in glory among the trojans , strong and brave like me , and rule all troy in power and one day let them say , 'he is a better man than his father !
but none as rapt as nestor , achaea 's watch and ward , who stretched his hands to the starry skies and prayed , father zeus !
mesthles and antiphus led maeonia 's proud contingent , talaemenes ' two sons sprung from the nymph of gyge lake led on maeonian units born and bred under mount tmolus
they are the very strain farseeing zeus gave tros , payment in full for stealing ganymede , tros 's son : the purest , strongest breed of all the stallions under the dawn and light of day
no , let her father pitch on some other argive — one who can please him , a greater king than i if the gods pull me through and i reach home alive , peleus needs no help to fetch a bride for me himself
athena rushed to achilles , her bright eyes gleaming , standing shoulder-to-shoulder , winging orders now : at last our hopes run high , my brilliant achilles — father zeus must love you — we will sweep great glory back to achaea 's fleet , we will kill this hector , mad as he is for battle !
aeneas the hunter , savage in all her nightmares , drives her mad with panic
no dardanus sired your line , you traitor , liar , no , mount caucasus fathered you on its flinty , rugged flanks and the tigers of hyrcania gave you their dugs to suck !
mercury lashes out at once : you , so now you lay foundation stones for the soaring walls of carthage !
so he decreed and phoebus did not neglect the father 's strong desires
i ’ ve spent all power of sea and sky against those trojans
you don the deathless arms of a great fighter — and all other fighters tremble before him , true , but you , you killed his comrade , gentle , strong , and against all rights you ripped the immortal armor off his head and shoulders
how long will he wait ?
there he stood up to me alone one day — and barely escaped my onslaught
but go i shall , to see my darling boy , to hear what grief has come to break his heart while he holds back from battle
pallas , awestruck by the famous name , cries out : come down onto dry land , whoever you are , speak with my father face-to-face
three times he tried to fling his arms around his neck , three times he embraced—nothing
the seasons loosed the purebred sleek-maned team , tethered them to their stalls , piled on ambrosia and leaned the chariot up against the polished walls that shimmered in the sun
but athena refused to hear theano 's prayers
rolling her eyes , fiery as he faltered , struggling to say more , she hurled the man back and reared twin snakes from her coiling hair and cracked her whips and raved in her rabid words : so , i ’ m in my dotage , am i ?
the god , look , the god !
he ruled budion 's fortress town in the old days but then , having killed some highborn cousin , fled to peleus and glistening thetis , begged for his own life and they sent him off with achilles , breaker of men , east to stallion-country to fight and die in troy
it ’ s your dotage , mother—you , you doddering wreck too spent to see the truth—that shakes you with anguish all for nothing now
mourn for his virtue !
the worst cowards , banded together , have their power but you and i have got the skill to fight their best !
look at your build
so hera trumpeted , lashing the nerve and fighting-fury in each man as athena , her eyes blazing , made for diomedes
that was the prince 's threat
that hour then and all day long till the sun went down they feasted and no god 's hunger lacked a share of the handsome banquet or the gorgeous lyre apollo struck or the muses singing voice to voice in choirs , their vibrant music rising
that day the olympians tried to chain him down , hera , poseidon lord of the sea , and pallas athena — you rushed to zeus , dear goddess , broke those chains , quickly ordered the hundred-hander to steep olympus , that monster whom the immortals call briareus
so he decreed and iris ran his message , racing with gale force to priam 's halls where cries and mourning met her
picture the wild boar that ’ s harried down from a ridge by snapping packs of hounds , some beast mount vesulus shielded for long or long the latian forests fed on the reeds that crowd their marshes : once stampeded into the nets he jolts to a halt , snorts , at bay , the hackles rising up on his neck , no hunter bold enough to approach him , take him on , at a safe remove they attack with spears and shouts
he scanned the achaean rampart : where could he find some chief , some captain to fight disaster off his men ?
their weapons are long , pointed stakes they like to fit with a supple thong for swifter hurling
ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , god of glory !
you never deign , do you , freely and frankly , to share your plots with me — never , not a word !
defying the deathless gods they built that wall and so it stood there steadfast no long time
close to the spot , extending toward the horizon— the sibyl points them out—are the fields of mourning , that is the name they bear
and hebe washed him clean , dressed him in robes to warm his heart , and flanking the son of cronus down he sat , ares exultant in the glory of it all
all that i will unfold , i will recall how the battle first began
iris swept to a stop and once they saw her poised at the stone threshold all sprang up , each urged her to sit beside him but she refused , pressing on with her message : no time for sitting now
hephaestus built it , your own dear son , and the doors fit snug and tight
no hope of holding their ground outside their own city walls , despite superior numbers
even without that power his spear flies straight to the mark , never stops , not till it bores clean through some fighter 's flesh
they would have clashed at once and tried their luck in war but the ruddy sun has plunged his weary team in the western sea and as daylight slips away he brings the nightfall on
like diana urging her dancing troupes along the eurotas ’ banks or up mount cynthus ’ ridge as a thousand mountain-nymphs crowd in behind her , left and right—with quiver slung from her shoulder , taller than any other goddess as she goes striding on and silent latona thrills with joy too deep for words
and i told patroclus clearly , 'once you have beaten off the lethal fire , quick , come back to the ships — you must not battle hector !
crowds of trojans were mobbing his colonnades — he gave them a tongue-lashing , sent them packing : get out — you good-for-nothings , public disgraces !
all , from the first to lowest ranks of achaea 's troops , should hear his words and mark his counsel well
so tydides prayed and athena heard his prayer , put spring in his limbs , his feet , his fighting hands and close beside him winged him on with a flight of orders : now take heart , diomedes , fight it out with the trojans !
gory with its hideous feasts
lycon , flailing , chopped the horn of peneleos ' horsehair-crested helmet but round the socket the sword-blade smashed to bits — just as peneleos hacked his neck below the ear and the blade sank clean through , nothing held but a flap of skin , the head swung loose to the side as lycon slumped down to the ground
but glaucus was first , lord of lycia 's shieldsmen now , the first to turn and he killed the gallant bathycles , chalcon 's prize son who had made his home in hellas , excelling the myrmidons all in wealth and fortune
the king is far too strong — he will crush us all
the women of troy would scorn me down the years
if only after death
no sooner said than an instant peal of thunder crashes on the left and down from the sky a shooting star comes gliding , trailing a flaming torch to irradiate the night as it comes sweeping down
only a veteran steeled at heart could watch that struggle and still thrill with joy and never feel the terror
he rose before her now , he savored her name : hera — where are you rushing ?
if you honored me last time and heard my prayer and rained destruction down on all achaea 's ranks , now bring my prayer to pass once more
the shield of aeneas soon as turnus hoisted the banner of war from laurentum ’ s heights and the piercing trumpets blared , soon as he whipped his horses rearing for action , clashed his spear against his shield— passions rose at once , all latium stirred in frenzy to swear the oath , and young troops blazed for war
and bracing the captain , arm around his waist , he helped him toward his shelter
but rugged diomedes gave him a grim look : escape ?
what are you saying ?
and the men who held the land of apaesus and adrestia , men who held pityea , terea 's steep peaks — the units led by adrestus joined by amphius trim in linen corslet , the two good sons of merops out of percote harbor , merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts
so it was in the old days too
all his wounds sealed shut , wherever they struck
ah , to a short life you bore me , mother — mother , she was laothoe , aged altes ' daughter
but a god still holds his hands above me , even me
for years you ’ ve looked askance at the homes of rising carthage , feared our ramparts
they will never let him tear the rich fat from the oxen , all night long they stand their guard but the lion craves meat , he lunges in and in but his charges gain him nothing , thick-and-fast from their hardy hands the javelins rain down in his face , and waves of roaring torches — these the big cat fears , balking for all his rage , and at dawn he slinks away , his spirits dashed
for years to come , i think , they will remember the feud that flared between us both
and when they had put aside desire for food and drink the old man began to weave his counsel among them : nestor was first to speak — from the early days his plans and tactics always seemed the best
all for briseis his heart was breaking now
then still in tears , they rush to perform the sibyl ’ s orders , no delay , they strive to pile up trees , to build an altar-pyre rising to the skies
meriones a match for the rapid god of battles ran for the tent , seized a fine bronze lance and hot for action rushed to catch his captain
— even so — writhing in death till all you trojans pay for patroclus ' blood and the carnage of achaeans killed by the racing ships when i was out of action !
and he sped to the rear to stir more ranks of argives , men refreshing their strength against the fast ships , dead on their feet from the slogging work of war — and anguish caught their hearts to see the trojans , troops who had stormed their massive wall in force
the glory might even have gone to them at any moment , so intent was the god who grips and shakes the earth as he surged his argives on and the god surged too , adding his own immortal force in their defense
or beat him down at patroclus ' hands at last ?
and straightway up to her chamber hermes climbed , the healer , in secret , lay in her arms in love and the woman bore the god a radiant son , eudorus — lightning on his feet and a crack man of war
remember aurora , tithonus ’ wife , and nereus ’ daughter ?
no slim band of men could ever finish him off , that rippling killer , he stacked so many men atop the tear-soaked pyre
she departs the sky and leaves her cloud behind
tears filling his eyes , his strong voice choked
her torments multiply , over and over her passion surges back into heaving waves of rage— she keeps on brooding , obsessions roil her heart : and now , what shall i do ?
down poseidon dove and yoked his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car , his pair that raced the wind with their golden manes streaming on behind them , and strapping the golden armor round his body , seized his whip that coils lithe and gold and boarded his chariot launching up and out , skimming the waves , and over the swells they came , dolphins leaving their lairs to sport across his wake , leaping left and right — well they knew their lord
now down the stretch they come , the exhausted runners closing on the goal when all at once unlucky nisus skids on a slick of blood they ’ d chanced to spill , killing bullocks , soaking the turf and green grass surface , here the racer , elated—victory won—pressing the pace he stumbles , pitching face-first in the filthy dung and blood of victims
just keep your promise , troy , and if i can save you , you must save me too— if i reveal the truth and pay you back in full
with that vow she turned away from her son and faced and urged her sisters of the deep , now down you go in the ocean 's folding gulfs to visit father 's halls — the old man of the sea — and tell him all
next antilochus , watching thoon veer for a quick escape , sprang and stabbed him , slashing away the whole vein that runs the length of the back to reach the neck — he severed it , sheared it clear and the man went sprawling , back flat in the dust and stretching out both hands to his friends-in-arms
but white-armed hera flared at him in anger : yes , there would be some merit even in what you say , lord of the silver bow — if all you gods , in fact , would set achilles and hector high in equal honor
lord anchises stole from that fine stock — behind laomedon 's back , tros 's grandson and heir to tros 's teams — he put some mares to the lusty stallions once and they foaled him a run of six in his royal house
the man who brings the ransom can take away the body , if olympian zeus himself insists in all earnest
they admire aeneas ’ gifts , admire iulus now—the glowing face of the god and the god ’ s dissembling words—and helen ’ s gown and the veil adorned with a yellow acanthus border
he loosed the glittering belt and slipped it off and the loin-piece and the plated guard below it , gear the bronzesmiths made
never— pallas strikes this blow , pallas sacrifices you now , makes you pay the price with your own guilty blood !
so he urged and up from the earth they caught the body in their arms , hoisting it high above their heads with a great heave — and trojan forces crowding behind them shouted out when they saw the argive fighters lift the corpse
anywhere , any land you please , that ’ s all i want
we must steel our hearts
now father anchises , deep in a valley ’ s green recess , was passing among the souls secluded there , reviewing them , eagerly , on their way to the world of light above
so he said , planted there
routed like herds of cattle or big flocks of sheep when two wild beasts stampede them away in terror , suddenly pouncing down in their midst — pitch darkness , the shepherd off and gone — so the defenseless argives panicked , routed
and so i will try to tell you something
rank and file streamed behind and rushed like swarms of bees pouring out of a rocky hollow , burst on endless burst , bunched in clusters seething over the first spring blooms , dark hordes swirling into the air , this way , that way — so the many armed platoons from the ships and tents came marching on , close-file , along the deep wide beach to crowd the meeting grounds , and rumor , zeus 's crier , like wildfire blazing among them , whipped them on
this city i build—it ’ s yours
he clamped a hand on the draft mule and shouted , step right up and get it — whoever wants that cup !
then the powers spoke out to ease me of my anguish : all that apollo will predict if you return to delos , he tells you here , of his own free will he sends us here before your doors
above them a black rock—now , now slipping , teetering , watch , forever about to fall
no waiting for us , for rutulian sword and torch to strike their ships !
quivering , there it stuck , and the stricken womb came booming back from its depths with echoing groans
the great gods on high decree it so
waiting , plotting , the other stumbling toward him , stunned , wild to grasp his knees , wild with all his heart to escape his death and grueling black fate as the great achilles raised his massive spear , wild to run him through — he ducked , ran under the hurl and seized achilles ' knees as the spear shot past his back and stuck in the earth , still starved for human flesh
the old man was terrified
his father would not let him fight , ever , he was the youngest-born of all his sons — priam loved him most , the fastest runner of all but now the young fool , mad to display his speed , went dashing along the front to meet his death
so these men will never budge from the gates though they are only two defenders — not till they kill us all or we kill them !
with that he planted a heel against patroclus ' chest , wrenched his brazen spear from the wound , kicked him over , flat on his back , free and clear of the weapon
and the other sons of achaea , running up around him , crowded closer , all of them gazing wonder-struck at the build and marvelous , lithe beauty of hector
with him at my side we would go through fire and make it back alive — no one excels the mastermind of battle
never a thought of death weighs down your spirit now , yet death is right beside you
i ’ ve earned your trust , what ’ s more
now , both armed , they move out at once , and as they go an escort of ranking trojans , warriors young and old , sees them off at the gates with many prayers
help me , i beg you
imagine — i and achilles , wrangling over a girl , battling man-to-man
pray to yourselves in silence , so trojans can not hear — no , pray out loud !
no , mother , you are the one to pray
but teucer and ajax , aiming at him together , shot !
all that flow from the crests of ida down to breaking surf , the rhesus and the heptaporus , caresus and the rhodius , grenicus and aesepus , and the shining god scamander and simois ' tides where tons of oxhide shields and horned helmets tumbled deep in the river silt and a race of men who seemed half god , half mortal
till the hero meriones moved in where he sprawled , wrenched the spear from his corpse and the dark came shrouding down across his eyes
take me back to my black ship
and his mother wailed now , standing beside priam , weeping freely , loosing her robes with one hand and holding out her bare breast with the other , her words pouring forth in a flight of grief and tears : hector , my child !
and they , if they go running home to the land they love , then the two of us , i and sthenelus here will fight our way to the fixed doom of troy
all who join the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , who drink wine at the king 's expense and hold command of your own troops , your rank and fame from zeus !
a mighty king , raging against an inferior , is too strong
down at his feet he flung his useless helmet , the one he donned when he played at war , acting out mock battles
i will marry no daughter of agamemnon
so achilles groaned , deeply , crying out to his myrmidons , o my captains !
but make your left horse hug that post so close the hub of your well-turned wheel will almost seem to scrape the rock — just careful not to graze it !
and then as he gasped his last in flames from his riven chest she swept him up in a cyclone , impaled the man on a crag
he made all smooth along the rip of the hellespont and piled the endless beaches deep in sand again and once he had leveled the argives ' mighty wall he turned the rivers flowing back in their beds again where their fresh clear tides had run since time began
but opposing them at once , a mix of views and voices rises up for turnus
at once she saw the sea lord blustering strong in the war where men win glory , her own brother and husband 's brother too , and her heart raced with joy
the noble heralds brought on the victims marked for the gods to seal and bind the oaths
he shook his head as achilles briskly told his men and serving-women to make beds in the porch 's shelter , to lay down some heavy purple throws for the beds themselves and over them spread some blankets , thick woolly robes , a warm covering laid on top
throw our arms around each other , just for a moment — take some joy in the tears that numb the heart !
— you all went down to death on the same day
he never fed his nestlings in the end
how i feared the realm of libya might well do you harm !
that was our hope while fortune still smiled
they shook the dust from their manes and galloped off , speeding the fast chariot just where the armies clashed
one comes with his son , pallas , the other brings achates
but then polypoetes braced for battle took the weight and far as a seasoned herdsman flings his throwing staff , whirling in flight across his cows to keep them all in line — so far he outhurled the whole field
that man — if i could see him bound for the house of death , i could say my heart had forgot its wrenching grief !
where are their towns ?
— this howling din could drown the clearest voice
where are you running ?
my hackles bristled , voice choked in my throat , and my wife spoke out to ease me of my anguish : my dear husband , why so eager to give yourself to such mad flights of grief ?
and lashed with fear by their master 's angry voice they put on a surge , closing on them fast
chest out , meet your enemy head-on !
he assumes the form and features of old butes , armor-bearer , once , to dardan anchises , trusty guard of his gates until aeneas made him ascanius ’ aide
at that the prince of the battle cry complied with a high piercing shout that reached all troops : friends — lords of the argives , o my captains !
a small price to pay
when they had put aside desire for food and drink , nestor the noble old horseman spoke out first : marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , no more trading speeches now
haggard , helpless , there in our midst he stood , all eyes riveted on him now , and turning a wary glance at the lines of trojan troops he groaned and spoke : where can i find some refuge , where on land , on sea ?
what should he do ?
what does the great god want with me ?
achilles alone could ram it home himself
and the famous crippled smith forged a meadow deep in a shaded glen for shimmering flocks to graze , with shepherds ' steadings , well-roofed huts and sheepfolds
but halaesus hot for combat charges against them now , compressing all his force behind his weapons
how could you leave me all alone ? — so cruel !
who , noble cato , could pass you by in silence ?
see how the twin plumes stand joined on his helmet ?
and after him comes tullus disrupting his country ’ s peace to rouse a stagnant people , armies stale to the taste of triumph , back to war again
turning to leave , my tears brimmed and i said a last farewell : live on in your blessings , your destiny ’ s been won !
but there was a day i shone among the champions
and back apollo strode , a god in the wars of men while glorious hector ordered skilled cebriones , flog the team to battle !
and they leave behind a haul of soldiers ’ armor struck in solid silver , mixing-bowls in the bargain , gorgeous rugs
so , you ’ re not about to destroy us root and branch , not if you plant such courage , such resolve in our young soldiers ’ hearts
nestor the old driver gave them marching orders — a sharp glance at each , odysseus most of all : try hard now , bring him round — invincible achilles !
and there it rested
eumedes charges into the melee , grandson of old eumedes , bearing that veteran ’ s name but famed for his father dolon ’ s heart and hand in war
clear blue as the heavens , stream most loved by the gods who rule the sky
now i charged their lines like a black tornado , i captured fifty chariots there , and each time two men bit the dust , crushed beneath my spear
and now in a breakneck charge peneleos closed with lycon — they would missed each other with spears , two wasted casts , so now both clashed with swords
no — we are here on the plain of troy — all troy 's in arms !
round her beloved son her glistening arms went streaming , flinging her shining robe before him , only a fold but it blocked the weapons hurtling toward his body
they are hard for mortal men to curb or drive , for all but achilles — his mother is immortal
too much — like piling leaves or sand , and on and on they come , advancing across the plain to fight before our gates
soon they ’ re nearing the rock , swerving into the turn when gyas , holding the lead , still victor at mid-course , shouts out to his helmsman menoetes : where are you heading ?
i tell you this , so help me it 's the truth : if zeus with his storm-shield and queen athena ever let me plunder the strong walls of troy , you are the first , the first after myself — i will place some gift of honor in your hands , a tripod , or purebred team with their own car or a fine woman to mount and share your bed
flying before them now like clouds of crows or starlings screaming murder , seeing a falcon dive in for the kill , the hawk that wings grim death at smaller birds — so pursued by aeneas and hector argive fighters raced , screaming death-cries , lust for battle lost and masses of fine armor littered both sides of the trench as the argives fled in fear , no halt in the fighting , not now —
but he 's at the front , i am sure , engaging trojans , slashing his spear to save patroclus ' body
then you , glaucus , you fight for me with bronze !
counting on this , i planned my approach to you
aeneas commands the flooding crowds to clear the whole broad arena , leave the field wide open
off they scurry into the woods and trust to night
and then and there the achaeans might have taken troy , her towering gates toppling under patroclus ' power heading the vanguard , storming on with his spear
this strong cure , it ’ s none of the work of human skills , no expert ’ s arts in action
but brilliant achilles taunted hector 's body , dead as he was , die , die !
but the trojans swarmed like flame , like a whirlwind following hector son of priam blazing on nonstop , their war cries shattering , crying as one man — their hopes soaring to take the argive ships and slaughter all their best against the hulls
so , cloaked in folds of mist , they hide their feelings , waiting , hoping to see what luck their friends have found
he heard our pleas and replied with calming words : you happy , happy people , men of old ausonia , land where saturn ruled , what drives you now to shatter your blessed peace ?
if your commands will keep my pallas safe and if the fates intend to preserve my son , and if i live to see him , join him again , why then i pray for life— i can suffer any pain on earth
and loosing a heady laugh of triumph paris leapt from his hiding-place and shouted out in glory , now you are hit — no wasted shot , my winging arrow !
time to rest , to enjoy the sweet relief of sleep
all our lives are honed to the hard edge of steel , reversing our spears we spur our oxen ’ s flanks
so the immortals spun our lives that we , we wretched men live on to bear such torments — the gods live free of sorrows
here in another sector , mezentius—grim sight—is shaking a tuscan pine beam , hurling fire and smoky pitch at the foe as messapus , breaker of horses , neptune ’ s son , is ripping open a rampart , shouting : ladders—scale the walls !
most grasping man alive , how can the generous argives give you prizes now ?
but now by the beaked ships , far from your parents , glistening worms will wriggle through your flesh , once the dogs have had their fill of your naked corpse — though we have such stores of clothing laid up in the halls , fine things , a joy to the eye , the work of women 's hands
for the battles to come , hold back for now , dear boy !
we are not so dull of mind , we carthaginians here
if paris brings menelaus down in blood , he keeps helen himself and all her wealth and we sail home in our racing deep-sea ships
as he gasps out his last , his oblivious comrades leave him sprawled in the nameless dust and opis flies away to mount olympus
aeneas , achates , both were amazed , both struck with joy and fear
yes , hard as it was to uproot them once from tyre !
down through the bracing godsent night it came like good nestor in features , height and build , the old king himself , and hovering at my head the dream called me on : 'still asleep , agamemnon ?
if only an aide could speed the word to achilles
who keeps you from our embrace ?
at first he would trailed him a full discus-throw but now he was closing , gaining on him fast — yes , blaze with all her fury and flowing mane , agamemnon 's mare was coming on with a strong surge and now if the two teams had a longer course to run menelaus would have passed him — no dead heat about it
my son — does he still lie by the beached ships , or by now has the great achilles hacked him limb from limb and served him to his dogs ?
swerving off the trail they both lay facedown with the corpses now as dolon sped by at a dead run , the fool
when he saw his city stormed and seized , his gates wrenched apart , the enemy camped in his palace depths , the old man dons his armor long unused , he clamps it round his shoulders shaking with age and , all for nothing , straps his useless sword to his hip , then makes for the thick of battle , out to meet his death
agamemnon cried out too , calling men to arms and harnessed up in gleaming bronze himself
late in the day he ’ d chanced to come to troy incensed with a mad , burning love for cassandra : son-in-law to our king , he would rescue troy
it 's hard to fight the olympian strength for strength
at once the men arranged the sacrifice for apollo , making the cattle ring his well-built altar , then they rinsed their hands and took up barley
now you lack the daring to save him from the dogs
first , the winner , shall have a horse with dazzling trappings
she had climbed to pergamus heights and from that point she saw her beloved father swaying tall in the chariot , flanked by the herald , whose cry could rouse the city
we are denied the sailor ’ s right to shore— attacked , forbidden even a footing on your beach
they kept on urging the sharp-eyed giant-killer hermes to go and steal the body , a plan that pleased them all , but not hera , poseidon or the girl with blazing eyes
my father , anchises , whenever the darkness shrouds the earth in its dank shadows , whenever the stars go flaming up the sky , my father ’ s anxious ghost warns me in dreams and fills my heart with fear
and the glistening goddess moved among them now , seized achilles ' hand and urged him , spoke his name : my child , leave your friend to lie there dead — we must , though it breaks our hearts
and the greathearted achilles , flensing fat from all , wrapped the corpse with folds of it , head to foot , then heaped the flayed carcasses round patroclus
now up steps clausus from cures , flushed with his young strength and flings his burly spear from a distance , hitting dryops under the chin full force to choke the trojan ’ s throat as he shouted , cutting off both his voice and life in the same breath , and his brow slams the ground as he vomits clots of blood
the arrows clanged at his back as the god quaked with rage , the god himself on the march and down he came like night
go back to your own rank and file , i tell you !
just so madly turnus whips his horses into the heart of battle , chargers steaming sweat , trampling enemy fighters killed in agony—kicking gusts of bloody spray , their hoofs stamping into the sand the clotted gore
first the god commanded the great and little ajax , hungry for war as both men were already , ajax , ajax !
spirits high , consent to the pact i have decreed
or was it all a dream ?
my kin were glad to oblige and grant them their requests — till zeus changed our minds with a flash of bad omens
the one who wants her — step this way and try — he will have to fight me for her with his fists !
thymber—he lops off your head with one sweep of evander ’ s sword and , larides , chops your hand and the fighter ’ s dying hand gropes for its body , quivering fingers claw for the sword once more
pick my own comrade ?
does your courage really drive you to challenge me ?
nor had hector once got wind of the rampage
sweat from under the heavy buckler 's flat strap had rubbed him raw , he was chafed and his arm ached from lifting up the strap , wiping off the blood and the dark clots
what was the worst , most brazen thing he could do ?
i doubt he will keep from the fighting any longer , not with all his war-lust !
just past the city walls a grave-mound lies where an old shrine of forsaken ceres stands with an ancient cypress growing close beside it— our fathers ’ reverence kept it green for years
then lifting his rugged helmet he set it down on his brows , and the horsehair crest shone like a star and the waving golden plumes shook that hephaestus drove in bristling thick along its ridge
where ’ s juno in this ?
down he went , his corpse full length on the ground — just as achilles charged at piras ' handsome son , rhigmus who would sailed from the fertile soil of thrace — achilles pierced his belly , the bronze impaled his guts and out of his car he pitched as his driver areithous swung the horses round but achilles speared his back and the spearshaft heaved him off the chariot too and the panicked stallions bolted
no time for tears , not now , warned saturn ’ s daughter
for suddenly , just as the men tried to cross , a fatal bird-sign flashed before their eyes , an eagle flying high on the left across their front and clutching a monstrous bloody serpent in both talons , still alive , still struggling — it had not lost its fight , writhing back to strike it fanged the chest of its captor right beside the throat — and agonized by the bites the eagle flung it away to earth , dashed it down amidst the milling fighters , loosed a shriek and the bird veered off along the gusting wind
you gave me life , short as that life will be , so at least olympian zeus , thundering up on high , should give me honor — but now he gives me nothing
did you , my own father , dream that i could run away and desert you here ?
we ’ re rugged stock , from the start we take our young ones down to the river , toughen them in the bitter icy streams
she ’ s faint from loss of blood , her eyes failing , chill with death , and the glowing color she had , once , fades away
so all his shipmates gathered round his body and raised a loud lament , devoted aeneas in the lead
the mules in the lead hauled out the four-wheeled wagon , driven on by seasoned idaeus
hard as you scan the lines , there 's no more telling from which side we are harried — carnage left and right
sing to me now , you muses , you who hold olympus ' vaulting halls , how fire was first pitched on achaea 's ships !
a man heading out of the trojan camp !
an icy shiver runs through the trojans ’ sturdy spines and the king ’ s prayers come pouring from his heart : apollo , you always pitied the trojans ’ heavy labors !
let him set sail !
building her gorgeous city , doting on your wife
why , the long-haired achaeans must be roaring with laughter !
by the cruel seas i swear i felt no fear for myself to match my fear that your ship , stripped of her tiller , steersman wrenched away , might founder in that great surge
then off he sped himself with the speed of a darting hawk that soaring up from a sheer rock face , hovering high , swoops at the plain to harry larks and swallows — so the lord of the earthquake sped away from both
and once both armies had closed to a spearcast away they reined back to a halt— then abruptly surge forward , shouting , whipping their teams into combat frenzy , weapons pelting thick as a snowstorm shrouds the skies in darkness
so cacus , caught in that stunning flood of light , shut off in his hollow rock , howling as never before— hercules overwhelms him from high above , raining down all weapons he finds at hand , torn-off branches , rocks like millstones
your shelters overflow with the wine achaean ships bring in from thrace , daily , down the sea 's broad back
cebriones rushed to obey — but hector leapt down from the burnished car , he hit the earth with a yell , seized a rock and went for teucer , mad to strike the archer just plucking a bitter arrow from his quiver , notching it on the string and drawing back the bow to his right shoulder , when hector , helmet flashing , caught him where the collarbone bridges neck and chest , the deadliest spot of all
distraught with the rising anguish , atreus ' son went ranging back and forth , commanding heralds to sound out loud and clear and call the men to muster , each by name , but no loud outcry now
there , look , rearing against the lord poseidon phoebus apollo loomed , bristling winged arrows , rearing against ares , blazing-eyed athena , rearing against hera , artemis with arrow of gold and cry that halloos the hunt , the goddess raining shafts , huntress sister of phoebus the distant deadly archer — rearing against leto , hermes the running god of luck and against the fire-god rose the great deep-swirling river immortals call the xanthus , mankind calls scamander
how those hot-blooded epeans scattered in terror !
oh a goddess , without a doubt !
headlong ruin 's massing against us quickly
ground down by the war and driven back by fate , the greek captains had watched the years slip by until , helped by minerva ’ s superhuman skill , they built that mammoth horse , immense as a mountain , lining its ribs with ship timbers hewn from pine
then at the fourth assault patroclus like something superhuman — then , patroclus , the end of life came blazing up before you , yes , the lord apollo met you there in the heart of battle , the god , the terror !
the ghost of cassandra came to me in dreams , the prophetess gave me flaming brands and said : look for troy right here , your own home here !
but swear to apollo , wolf-god , glorious archer , you will slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs when you march home to zelea 's sacred city
give my son — he wo not live long — a shield and helmet and tooled greaves with ankle-straps and armor for his chest
force makes a breach and the greeks come storming through , butcher the sentries , flood the entire place with men-at-arms
but hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer , suddenly bursting out , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
achilles lets it go
if orpheus could summon up the ghost of his wife , trusting so to his thracian lyre and echoing strings ; if pollux could ransom his brother and share his death by turns , time and again traversing the same road up and down ; if theseus , mighty hercules—must i mention them ?
suddenly warmth drains from her grief-stricken body , the shuttle ’ s flung from her hand , the yarn unravels and off she flies , poor thing
your cup stands filled , always , brimmed like mine when the will stirs you to drink — so now drink deep of battle
i can see it now !
our oaths , our sworn truce — zeus the son of cronus throned in the clouds has brought them all to nothing and all the father decrees is death for both sides at once
he stood there a moment , stunned , then swinging his seven-ply oxhide shield behind him , drew back in caution , throwing a fast glance at his own achaean troops like a trapped beast , pivoting , backpedaling , step by short step
he left him there in place , heading for other chiefs
but the man who attacked you ?
intelligence fills their hearts , voice and strength their frames , from the deathless gods they have learned their works of hand
but mark my words
down she sank with ares , resistance quite dissolved , two immortals spread on the earth that rears us all with pallas trumpeting over them winged exultations : down you go !
please , themis , the white-armed goddess hera answered firmly , do not ask me to go through that ordeal again
a hushed silence held the ranks
heart writhing in pain , she climbed aboard the car and iris climbed beside her , seized the reins , whipped the team to a run and on the horses flew , holding nothing back
so he prays and choosing a pair of galleys from the fleet , he mans them both with rowers while fitting out his troops with battle gear
but i will suffer terrible grief for you , menelaus , if you die now , if you fill out your destiny now — and i go back to parching argos in disgrace
the great goddess fiery-eyed athena set him on , that fool — does not the son of tydeus know , down deep , the man who fights the gods does not live long ?
wait , take my advice and call a halt right here : no more battling with fiery-haired menelaus , pitting strength against strength in single combat — madness
grim reminder — he brandished the shaft and hurled with all his might but athena blew it back from achilles bent on glory — a quick light breath and the shaft flew back again to tall prince hector and fell before his feet
down the immortals launched to the field of action — their warring spirits split the gods two ways
i dread this murderous man — he will burst right through our walls
crowding thick-and-fast as the swarms of flies seething over the shepherds ' stalls in the first spring days when the buckets flood with milk — so many long-haired achaeans swarmed across the plain to confront the trojans , fired to smash their lines
burn them to ash , those phrygian chiefs encamped at ease along our lovely river , and all their painted ships !
aeneas takes delight in the goddess ’ gifts and the honor of it all as he runs his eyes across them piece by piece
now she ’ s calybe , aged priestess of juno ’ s temple , so she appears in the young king ’ s eyes and urges : turnus , how can you lie back and let your labors come to nothing ?
and patroclus gave ground , backing a good way off , clear of the deadly archer 's wrath
some hoisted up the enormous bier—sad service— their eyes averted , after their fathers ’ ways of old , and thrust the torch below
lost to the clan , lost to the hearth , lost to the old ways , that one who lusts for all the horrors of war with his own people
and quick as the god of war meriones led the way till they reached the front his captain pointed out
ah but i think you will find the work quite taxing
but grant one prayer
so he recoiled , shouting out to comrades , oh my friends , what fools we were to marvel at wondrous hector , what a spearman , we said , and what a daring fighter !
but the sacred images of our trojan household gods , those i ’ d saved from the fires that swept through troy
only a joke , and nothing more , but his words , once heard , first spelled an end of troubles
but now , father , i come back to you and your resolves
at that , the etruscan fighting ranks subsided , checked on the field of battle , struck with awe by the warnings of the gods
far from your birthplace , gyge lake where your father 's fine estate lies next to the hyllus stocked with fish and next to the whirling hermus !
or agamemnon ’ s orestes hounded off the stage , fleeing his mother armed with torches , black snakes , while blocking the doorway coil her furies of revenge
down through the vast clear air flies mercury , rowing his wings like oars and in a moment stands on libya ’ s shores , obeys commands and the will of god is done
also , father will give twelve women , beauties all , and a dozen captive soldiers , each in armor—more , whatever lands their king latinus claims for himself
a hushed silence went through all the achaean ranks , ashamed to refuse , afraid to take his challenge
overpowered in all his power , sprawled in the dust , achilles lay there , fallen
at once he orders them led out to the trojans , one for each , swift with their winging hoofs , decked in embroidered purple saddle-blankets , golden medallions dangling from their chests , their trappings gold , pure gold the bridle bits they champ between their teeth
go , quickly , carry my last commands to turnus : take over the fighting , free the town from trojans !
so juno appealed and venus did not oppose her , nodding in assent and smiling at all the guile she saw through
but devout aeneas mounds the tomb—an immense barrow crowned with the man ’ s own gear , his oar and trumpet— under a steep headland , called after the herald now and for all time to come it bears misenus ’ name
i would say an immortal came your way and gave you these
but poseidon surging in secret out of the gray surf went driving into the argive ranks and lashed them on , agonized for the fighters beaten down by trojans , and his churning outrage rose against great zeus
it ’ s fate that called you on to reach our shores
i do not tell you to match the leader 's speed , skilled diomedes ' team — look , athena herself just fired their pace and gave their master glory
their captain 's down , the first to storm our wall , the great sarpedon
why do you sport that bow , you spineless fool ?
the old man cinched it on whenever he would harness up , marching his men to war where fighters die — nestor gave no ground to withering old age
but the cunning driver , even handling slower horses , always watches the post , turns it close , never loses the first chance to relax his reins and stretch his pair but he holds them tight till then , eyes on the leader
but now not a single trojan flees his death , not one the gods hand over to me before your gates , none of all the trojans , sons of priam least of all !
i will strap on the brave achilles ' armor , burnished armor i stripped from strong patroclus when i killed him !
but his mother simply turned away to the palace
yet he ’ s less avid now , exulting less and less when his horses win the day
but hector — apollo stood by him and drove him on , disguised as phaenops , asius ' son abydos-born , dearest to hector of all his foreign guests
how can i fight against this dreadful omen ?
and zeus who gathers the breasting clouds assured her , hera — nothing to fear , no god or man will see us — i will wrap us round in a golden cloud so dense not even the sun 's rays , the sharpest eyes in the world , will pierce the mist and glimpse us making love !
still you must approach her oracle , beg the seer with prayers to chant her prophecies , all of her own accord , unlock her lips and sing with her own voice
reaching the old king 's side the crier roused him sharply : son of laomedon , rise up !
i confess it , anna , yes
her voice rang out in tears and the women wailed in answer , grief for patroclus calling forth each woman 's private sorrows
even so , i must tell you why i called you here
and the cretan captain idomeneus answered warmly , i know your style , your courage
so meges chopped at the crown of dolops ' bronze helmet , split its spiny ridge with a sharp cleaving spear and sheared away its bristling horsehair crest
what horrors i saw , a tragedy where i played a leading role myself
when zeus who loves the lightning mixes gifts for a man , now he meets with misfortune , now good times in turn
time and again i tamed the wild rage of sky and sea , the same on land—xanthus and simois be my witness— i cared for your aeneas
so now , i tell you , drop this anger for your son
i know in my soul i don ’ t deserve to suffer
so my hopes ride high that we can seize them now if you have the heart to join me
but if priam and priam 's sons refuse to pay , refuse me , agamemnon — with paris beaten down — then i myself will fight it out for the ransom , i will battle here to the end of our long war
an outright gift to atrides agamemnon and menelaus , euneus gave a shipment of wine , a thousand measures full
that gentle man , the soul of kindness to all while the man was still alive
there — before he could heft it — a sudden lunge and lycurgus ' spear had run him through the guts
screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath , fighters killing , fighters killed , and the ground streamed blood
from there he slipped away to his father 's house , struggling home from lemnos , but only eleven days he cheered his heart with friends
the people , the elders all demand that aeneas be recalled and men dispatched to tell him how the land lies
i beg you , apollo , heal this throbbing wound , lull the pain now , lend me power in battle — so i can rally our lycians , drive them into war and fight to save my comrade 's corpse myself
now where 's your sense ?
all people know the story , all at the earth ’ s edge , cut off where the rolling ocean pounds them back , and all whom the ruthless sun in the torrid zone , arching amidst the four cool zones of earth , sunders far from us
but strike a pact with me , swear you will defend me with all your heart , with words and strength of hand
anchors run from prows , the sterns line the shore
back to the ships , quick , or you will run for your life !
dark blood oozes out and fouls the soil with filth
but what olympian wished it so , who sent you down to bear such heavy labor ?
do you need me ?
i deserve more pity
he ran through ranks of achaeans armed in bronze , searching for brave machaon
but at that point he refused to beat disaster off — refused himself , that is — but he buckled his own armor round patroclus , sent him into battle with an army at his back
so now let diomedes , powerful as he is , be on his guard for fear a better soldier than you engage him — for fear his wife , aegialia , adrastus ' daughter , for all her self-control , will wail through the nights and wake her beloved servants out of sleep
he 's the one to do his achaean comrades proud , do himself proud too , if he comes through alive from the fight that waits him , dueling to the death
you can make brothers bound by love gear up for mutual slaughter , demolish a house with hatred , fill it to the roofs with scourges , funeral torches
he pitched from his car , the reins poured to the ground and on foot meriones grabbed them up in his hands , shouting out at idomeneus , whip them hard now !
let no one ’ s violence overwhelm your power here as a father to give his daughter to a man , an outstanding man , a marriage earned in full and sealed by pacts of peace that last forever
you , my sister , you were the first , won over by my tears , to pile these sorrows on my shoulders , mad as i was , to throw me into my enemy ’ s arms
queen juno has hardly wiped me from her mind
down he crashed — horror gripped the achaean armies
and hector rose and spoke between both sides : hear me — trojans , achaeans geared for combat !
and then he spots two men , grief-stricken and robbed of death ’ s last tribute : leucaspis and orontes , the lycian fleet ’ s commander
take briseis at once , his beauty briseis by the hand and bring her here
quicker than his command he calms the heaving seas , putting the clouds to rout and bringing back the sun
that would be the disgrace
what destiny hounds you on to visit these , these sunless homes of sorrow , harrowed lands ?
i shall bestow the gods and their sacred rites
why , she and her frenzy blinded zeus one time , highest , greatest of men and gods , they say : even father zeus !
once achilles had poured the wine and prayed to zeus , he returned to his shelter , stowed the cup in the chest then took his stand outside , his spirit yearning still to watch achaeans and trojans struggle to the death
he weeps as he speaks and draws from his shoulder-strap a sword of gold , forged by one lycaon of crete : marvelous work , fitted with ivory sheath and set for action
i must implore that terrible , violent man
and not a man came forward who did not stab his body , glancing toward a comrade , laughing : ah , look here — how much softer he is to handle now , this hector , than when he gutted our ships with roaring fire !
why , i lost a son of my own with all the rest—sarpedon
grant our return in glory back to the warships once we have done some feat that brings the trojans pain !
they can not hold me off any longer , these achaeans , not even massed like a wall against me here — they will crumble under my spear , well i know , if the best of immortals really drives me on , hera 's lord whose thunder drums the sky !
so they sing his praise , and to crown it sing of cacus ’ cave , the monster breathing fire , and all the woods resound with the ringing hymns , and the hillsides echo back
i throw myself on your mercy , whoever you may be
and fleeing orsilochus now as the trojan drives her round in a huge ring , camilla tricks him , wheeling inside him , quick , the pursuer now the pursued as she rears above him— praying , begging for mercy—her battle-axe smashes down , blow after blow through armor , bone , splitting his skull , warm brains from the wound go splashing down his face
whatever struggle is still to come , i ’ ll manage it myself
ah too bad , and i always thought you excelled the rest in sense , all who hale from lycia 's fertile soil
euryalus radiant , famed for the bloom of youth—nisus , for the pure love he devoted to the boy
thundering on , on like oxen broad in the brow some field hand yokes to crush white barley heaped on a well-laid threshing floor and the grain is husked out fast by the bellowing oxen 's hoofs — so as the great achilles rampaged on , his sharp-hoofed stallions trampled shields and corpses , axle under his chariot splashed with blood , blood on the handrails sweeping round the car , sprays of blood shooting up from the stallions ' hoofs and churning , whirling rims — and the son of peleus charioteering on to seize his glory , bloody filth splattering both strong arms , achilles ' invincible arms —
as mistletoe in the dead of winter ’ s icy forests leafs with life on a tree that never gave it birth , embracing the smooth trunk with its pale yellow bloom , so glowed the golden foliage against the ilex evergreen , so rustled the sheer gold leaf in the light breeze
a sudden rumor flies through the little town : horsemen are rushing toward the tuscan monarch ’ s gates !
that time , alone , apart from his men , he marched the message into thebes , filled with hordes of thebans , i told him to banquet in their halls and eat in peace
long before that the city will be sacked , plundered top to bottom !
and here , instantly struck with terror , aeneas grips his sword and offers its naked edge against them as they come , and if his experienced comrade had not warned him they are mere disembodied creatures , flimsy will-o ’ -the-wisps that flit like living forms , he would have rushed them all , slashed through empty phantoms with his blade
but just out of the turn , starting the homestretch back to sunlit sea the horses lunged , each driver showed his form , the whole field went racing full tilt and at once the fast mares of eumelus surged far out in front — and after him came diomedes ' team , tros 's stallions hardly a length behind now , closing at each stride and at any moment it seemed they would mount eumelus ' car , their hot breath steaming his back and broad shoulders , their heads hovering over him , breakneck on they flew — and now he would have passed him or forced a dead heat if apollo all of a sudden raging at diomedes had not knocked the shining whip from his fist
so nestor said and atrides ranged forward , glad at heart , and came on peteos ' son the charioteer menestheus standing idle , and circling him athenian men who could raise the cry of battle
as when some master tanner gives his crews the hide of a huge bull for stretching , the beast 's skin soaked in grease and the men grab hold , bracing round in a broad circle , tugging , stretching hard till the skin 's oils go dripping out as the grease sinks in , so many workers stretch the whole hide tough and taut — so back and forth in a cramped space they tugged , both sides dragging the corpse and hopes rising , trojans hoping to drag patroclus back to troy , achaeans to drag him back to the hollow ships and round him always the brutal struggle raging
little iulus , your father and your wife , so i once was called
what rough fortune has driven him to despair ?
in the front ranks he will sprawl , i think , torn open , a rout of his comrades down around their captain just as the sun goes rising into dawn
and you , my wife , most blessed woman in all the world , how lucky you were to die , spared this wrenching grief !
the lord of men spoke out from where he stood : my friends , fighting danaans , aides of ares
cowering backward fast the trojans gave ground , hector , aeneas and chromius , noble prince , deserted aretus there , his life torn out , sprawled on the spot
the burdens of old age already weigh you down
wherever he fought to force his way , no luck , the merciless fury blocks his efforts
so this , he thinks , is the man foretold by fate
but he caught his breath again
but a light urging sent by the god of earthquakes rippled through their lines and whipped battalions on
already arcadian horsemen flanked by strong etruscans hold assigned positions
here was the ugliest man who ever came to troy
no , you colossal , shameless — we all followed you , to please you , to fight for you , to win your honor back from the trojans — menelaus and you , you dog-face !
so ajax drew back , out of range , and then — they flung their tireless fire at a fast trim ship
you deceived me all along ?
up to the sky an immense billow hoists us , then at once , as the wave sank down , down we plunge to the pit of hell
so visitors may depart , deprived of her advice , and hate the sibyl ’ s haunts
he cuts down lamyrus too , lamus and serranus—well-built soldier , he ’ d gamed away till late at night and now lay numb in a drunken haze
or have you forgot the time i caught you all alone , i cut you off from your flocks and sent you scurrying down the slopes of ida ?
call machaon here , the son of asclepius , that unfailing healer , to see to menelaus , atreus ' fighting son
you led me through many seas , bordering endless coasts , far-off massylian tribes , and fields washed by the syrtes , and now , at long last , italy ’ s shores , forever fading , lie within our grasp
you never forget my friendship , never miss a chance to pay me the honor i deserve among our comrades
i would never give them a glance , a second thought , whether they fly on the right toward the dawn and sunrise or fly on the left toward the haze and coming dark !
next , mnestheus , flushed with victory in the ships , his brow still crowned with an olive wreath of green
and there her proud , mettlesome charger prances in gold and royal purple , pawing with thunder-hoofs , champing a foam-flecked bit
a dizzying swirl of anguish rushing down his eyes , blind with fear , the point had stuck so close
what becomes of them now , the pacts and oaths we swore ?
look at ajax now , with only a few years on me
that much respite and breathing room had ilus won—at ilus pallas had flung a rugged spear at long range , but rhoeteus pausing between them takes the point head-on as he flees from you , distinguished teuthras , you and your brother tyres— rhoeteus spilling out of his car in death-throes , drumming the fields of italy with his heels
aeneas , glad that the ship is salvaged , crew restored , gives sergestus the prize that he had promised : a slave girl , pholoë , born of cretan stock and hardly inept at minerva ’ s works of hand , nursing twins at her breast
so you , you strap my splendid armor on your back , you lead our battle-hungry myrmidons into action !
three times now the horns of the moon have filled with light since i ’ ve dragged out my lonely days through the woods , where only the wild things have their dens and lairs , and watched from a lookout crag for the giant cyclops , quaking to hear their rumbling tread , their shouts
more , if they have the crews
— or heading home to troy , now they have trounced our armies ?
safer by far , you find , to foray all through camp , commandeering the prize of any man who speaks against you
now straight through the great gates she drove the team , whipping them on full tilt until they came to zeus the son of cronus sitting far from the other gods , throned on the topmost crag of rugged ridged olympus
by now the day had slipped from the sky and the gentle moon was riding high through the heavens at mid-career , her horses pounding through the night
you could not tell — did he rampage now with the trojans or the argives ?
this terrible sorrow : since i saw it coming , anna , i can endure it now
whom do you flee ?
strong vow — and they bore straight down on the argives full force , shaking their spears , their hearts fired with hopes of dragging patroclus ' body out from under ajax — fools !
he subsided but hera the queen , her eyes wider , was terrified
lift your hands to zeus , you whip an arrow against that man , whoever he is who routs us , wreaking havoc against us , cutting the legs from under squads of good brave men
the next day , when the sun ’ s first torch had flared across the earth , taking different routes they explore the town , the borderlands and coasts these people hold
over the corpse he would cut down crowds of men , though now , at this point , ajax warned menelaus , lord of the battle cry , old friend , my prince , i lose hope that we alone , on our own power , can make it back from the fighting
there follows an army of mourners , trojans all , and all the tuscans , all the arcadians march with arms reversed
and now i see them all , the fiery-eyed achaeans , i know them all by heart , and i could tell their names
if by chance the victory goes to the latin , turnus , we agree the defeated will depart to evander ’ s city , iulus will leave this land
oh make me young again , and the strength inside me steady as a rock !
a crack of the whip — the goddess hera lashed the team , and all on their own force the gates of heaven thundered open , kept by the seasons , guards of the vaulting sky and olympus heights empowered to spread the massing clouds or close them round once more
the house of idomeneus tumbled to the ground ?
i tried to tear some green shoots from the brush to make a canopy for the altar with leafy boughs , when a dreadful , ghastly sight , too strange for words , strikes my eyes
too bad , my friend , said ajax
hera held them back , still enraged as she was
first he went for the mules and circling dogs but then , launching a piercing shaft at the men themselves , he cut them down in droves — and the corpse-fires burned on , night and day , no end in sight
but her father , son of cronus , hugged her tight and giving a low warm laugh inquired gently , who has abused you now , dear child , tell me , who of the sons of heaven so unfeeling , cruel ?
my father , tydeus , i really do not remember
forbidden before this to defile its crest in dust , it guarded the head and handsome brow of a god , a man like a god , achilles
the rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship
and now , spurred by his comrades ' quick approval , achilles was just about to give the man the mare when antilochus , son of magnanimous old nestor , leapt to his feet and lodged a formal protest : achilles — i will be furious if you carry out that plan !
so she cries before the entrance—suddenly all her features , all her color changes , her braided hair flies loose and her breast heaves , her heart bursts with frenzy , she seems to rise in height , the ring of her voice no longer human—the breath , the power of god comes closer , closer
and high in the clear sky zeus himself defended his champion — hector alone he prized and glorified among hordes of men for hector 's life would be cut short so soon
but soon as a spear or bowshot wounds the king and atrides mounts his chariot once again — then zeus will hand you the power to kill and kill till you cut your way to the benched ships and the sun sinks and the blessed darkness sweeps across the earth !
there is a harbor clear of the wind , and spacious , calm , a haven , but etna rumbles , hard by , showering deadly scree and now it heaves into the sky a thundering dark cloud , a whirlwind pitch-black with smoke and red-hot coals and it hurls up huge balls of fire that lap the stars— and now it vomits rocks ripped from the mountain ’ s bowels erupting lava into the air , enormous molten boulders , groaning magma roiling up from its bedrock depths
with good will to the chiefs he rose and spoke , great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon
she will provoke me , she with her shrill abuse
where has it gone , goddess , the trust you lodged in me ?
but reclining just beside them , the oldest fury holds back their hands from even touching the food , surging up with her brandished torch and deafening screams
but as father zeus caught sight of them from ida the god broke into a sudden rage and summoned iris to run a message on with a rush of golden wings : quick on your way now , iris , shear the wind !
achilles broke in quickly — how can i go to war ?
never , never again will he have the nerve to test my fighting power — even now he was glad to save himself from death
there is nothing alive more agonized than man of all that breathe and crawl across the earth
they slew oxen beside the tents and took their meal
but when odysseus sprang up , the famed tactician would just stand there , staring down , hard , his eyes fixed on the ground , never shifting his scepter back and forth , clutching it stiff and still like a mindless man
that man — i can not see him — the one i hurled at , wild to cut him down
no , the pressure of combat locked them head-to-head , lunging like wolves , and strife with wild groans exulted to see them , glaring down at the melee , strife alone of immortals hovering over fighters
it 's not my nature to shrink from battle , cringe in fear with the fighting strength still steady in my chest
the famous spearman idomeneus cut him down
so let me seize my glory among the trojans now — or i will spear you too , i will rip your own sweet life away !
now , so long as the battle-hungry meleager fought , it was deadly going for the curetes
so on they fought like a swirl of living fire — you could not say if the sun and moon still stood secure , so dense the battle-haze that engulfed the brave who stood their ground around patroclus ' body
straight at the gates he lashed his team , hell-bent , his troops crowding behind him shouting war cries , never thinking the argive line could still hold out — they would all be hurled back on their blackened hulls
the renowned spearman idomeneus led them all in force with meriones who butchered men like the god of war himself
and one day we shall lift your children to the stars and exalt your city ’ s power
oh , my country , gods of the hearth we tore from enemies , all for nothing , will no walls ever again be called the walls of troy ?
here the man stands over all achaea 's armies , our rugged bulwark braced for shocks of war
vaunting , aflash in arms , hector swept through the gates with his brother paris keeping pace beside him
with such thanks , swinging his spear around he strikes home at the mountain ’ s hollow flank and out charge the winds through the breach he ’ d made , like armies on attack in a blasting whirlwind tearing through the earth
dardan fighters hand-to-hand — now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
but he wept freely now as his feet swept him clear of the close fighting , bearing the dreadful news to peleus ' son achilles
his men marveled too , trading startled glances
and the old man , rushing to climb aboard his chariot , drove out through the gates and echoing colonnades
so over the driver here and both claw-mad for battle , patroclus son of menoetius , hector ablaze for glory strained to slash each other with ruthless bronze
even look at me ?
my ships are lying moored in the tuscan sea
down she plunged to the bottom fast as a lead weight sheathed in a glinting lure of wild bull 's horn , bearing hooked death to the ravenous fish
but the plowland here will rot your bones , my brother , as you lie dead in troy , your mission left unfinished
now the trumpets blare
they skinned the animal quickly , butchered the carcass , expertly cut the meat into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
don ’ t hunger to know their doom , what form of torture or twist of fortune drags them down
adamas , asius , both sprawled at achaea 's sterns , dead at the argives ' hands
this polydorus : the doomed priam had once dispatched him in secret , bearing a great weight of gold , to be maintained by the king of thrace when priam lost his faith in trojan arms and saw his city gripped by siege
he seized the wand that enchants the eyes of men whenever hermes wants , or wakes them up from sleep
whenever i am bent on tearing down some city filled with men you love — to please myself — never attempt to thwart my fury , hera , give me my way
but once achilles has met his death , his certain doom , take courage then , go fight on the front lines then — no other achaean can bring you down in war
that was the cry that fired each soldier 's heart
shut out in front of their parents ’ faces , eyes streaming tears , some pitch headlong into the trenches , pressed by the rout , some charge wildly , reins flying , ramming the gateways blocked by the rugged posts
look , the ocean shuts us in with immense blockades of waves , no land to fly to !
we stand at the altar , heads under trojan veils , and following helenus ’ orders first and foremost , duly burn our offerings , just as bidden , to juno , queen of argos
man to man they fight and the weapons luck first brought are dyed with fresh blood now
— and fling their lust for battle to the winds
but if my forces are not enough , i am hardly the one to relent , i ’ ll plead for the help i need , wherever it may be— if i can not sway the heavens , i ’ ll wake the powers of hell !
and zeus who marshals the thunderheads returned , maddening one
so the men were engaged throughout the camp
clasping aeneas ’ right hand , he held it long and heading up to the grove they leave the river
and there is paullus , and he will rout all argos and agamemnon ’ s own mycenae and cut perseus down— the heir of aeacus , born of achilles ’ warrior blood— and avenge his trojan kin and minerva ’ s violated shrine
and peteos ' son menestheus cringed to see them heading straight for his bastion , hurling ruin on
how could anyone—man or god—force your aeneas to pitch on war , to harry king latinus as his foe ?
i embrace it , i recognize the gods !
but i can not bear to see you agonize so long
he found prince hector , the son of wise king priam , sitting up now , sprawled on the ground no longer , just regaining his strength , just beginning to recognize his comrades round about him
all pulled up abreast as achilles pointed out the post , far off on the level plain , and stationed there beside it an umpire , old lord phoenix , his father 's aide-in-arms , to mark the field at the turn and make a true report
and no spirits may be conveyed across the horrendous banks and hoarse , roaring flood until their bones are buried , and they rest in peace
uphill , downhill , crisscross , zigzag on they tramped and once they reached the slopes of ida with all her springs , quickly pitching themselves at towering , leaf-crowned oaks , they put their backs into strokes of the whetted bronze axes and huge trunks came crashing down
all at once on the left flank he marked him , spurring companions , urging them to fight , for phoebus had filled each man with quaking fear
the captains of athens , stichius , staunch menestheus , bore amphimachus back to achaea 's waiting lines
you can see them streaming out of the whole city , men like ants that , wary of winter ’ s onset , pillage some huge pile of wheat to store away in their grange and their army ’ s long black line goes marching through the field , trundling their spoils down some cramped , grassy track
at last the armies clashed at one strategic point , they slammed their shields together , pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields pounded , boss on welded boss , and the sound of struggle roared and rocked the earth
impossible now to pick you out , my captains , man by man — the battle blazes up so wildly
i can just make out the ramparts forged by the cyclops
i go all-out as it is
all the hopes of the greeks , their firm faith in a war they ’ d launched themselves had always hinged on pallas athena ’ s help
but i have little hope he will come at all — for all his rage at hector
may the gods who hold the halls of olympus give you priam 's city to plunder , then safe passage home
his immense limbs collapse , and earth groans as his giant shield thunders down on his body
not even the thought of dido doomed to a cruel death ?
what of those gallant men who backed my sword and me ?
if a man obeys the gods they are quick to hear his prayers
i ’ d never have come if fate had not ordained me here a house and home
so thersites taunted the famous field marshal
this was juno ’ s fear and the goddess never forgot the old campaign that she had waged at troy for her beloved argos
when she sees latinus steeling himself against her , when the serpent ’ s crazing venom has sunk into her flesh , the fever raging through her entire body , then indeed the unlucky queen , whipped insane by ghastly horrors , raves in her frenzy all throughout the city
they send venulus out to great diomedes ’ city to seek reserves and announce that trojan ranks encamp in latium : aeneas arrives with his armada , bringing the conquered household gods of troy , claiming himself a king demanded now by fate
the fleet goes skimming over the whitecaps now , the men rejoicing to wheel their prows around to a coast they know , at last
then will the violent centuries , battles set aside , grow gentle , kind
look at this ugly wound — my whole arm rings with the stabbing pangs , the blood wo not clot , my shoulder 's a dead weight
so fighters worked away in the grim shocks of war
now he lies on the ground — his heart is breaking
not even the leopard 's fury makes the beast so proud , not even the lion 's , not the murderous wild boar 's , the greatest pride of all , bursting the boar 's chest — they are nothing next to the pride of panthous ' sons with their strong ashen spears
and so do i , by god !
and now his retinue rises in all their forms , enormous beasts of the deep , the veteran troupe of glaucus , ino ’ s son palaemon , wind-swift tritons , phorcus ’ army in full force with thetis , melite , virgin panopea out on the left , fair-isle , sea-cave , spray , and the waves ’ embrace
she ’ ll ride like a queen in triumph with her trophies ?
i ’ m here to die , but i bring you these gifts first !
flown off to the sky on wings or they roam the streams , as birds—how brutal , the punishments all my people have endured— and they make the cliffs re-echo with their cries
so now we plan how the war will all work out : do we rouse the pain and grisly fighting once again or hand down pacts of peace between both armies ?
murranus—no one dearer to me survived , a great soldier taken down by a great wound
no more sidling up to me , whining here before me
strong as you are — a goddess was your mother — he has more power because he rules more men
i tell you this , and i swear a mighty oath upon it
my poor people , you will pay for your outrage with your blood
i have learned it all too well
now , as soon as the others reached nestor 's tent they climbed down on the earth that feeds us all
i am off to the ends of the fruitful , teeming earth to visit ocean , fountainhead of the gods , and mother tethys who nourished me in their halls and reared me well
the trojans spot it , and first from the landward wall caicus calls out : what ’ s that mass , my countrymen , blackness rolling toward us ?
change yourself into any shape you please , call up whatever courage or skill you still have left
sheltered under his curving , beaked ships he found him , foreboding , deep down , all that had come to pass
now hector , dear to zeus , strode through the gates , clutching a thrusting-lance eleven forearms long ; the bronze tip of the weapon shone before him , ringed with a golden hoop to grip the shaft
poor lost fool , can ’ t you sense it , grasp it yet—the treachery of laomedon ’ s breed ?
hera went to the massed ships with pallas athena , poseidon who grips the earth , and hermes god of luck who excels them all at subtle twists and tactics — and the god of fire flanked them , seething power , hobbling along but his shrunken legs moved nimbly
you will bring a ray of hope to your men , your father too
come , let us keep clear of each other 's spears , even there in the thick of battle
ah but now , quite exposed , far from troy they battle around our hollow ships , thanks to our leader 's weakness , our armies ' slacking off
down from the temple roof come showers of lances hurled by our own comrades there , duped by the look of our greek arms , our greek crests that launched this grisly slaughter
none that touch me
fresh as the day we fought by celadon 's rapids , our pylians in platoons against arcadian spearmen under phia 's ramparts , round the iardanus ' banks
danaë once , they say , swept ashore by a southern gale , built that town for her father ’ s settlers , king acrisius
anna heard and , stunned , breathless with terror , raced through the crowd , her nails clawing her face , fists beating her breast , crying out to her sister now at the edge of death : was it all for this , my sister ?
so i may know , too well , just how cruelly i am the most dishonored goddess of them all
and discord surges up in the panic-stricken citizens , some insisting the gates be flung wide to the dardans , yes , and they hale the king himself toward the walls
stroking one of the argive women 's rippling gowns she 's pricked her limp wrist on a golden pinpoint !
you will make the crisis worse at any moment with this , this hanging back
but not a moment more would he turn his shining eyes to troy
down to the shore we go to take them on
eurypylus , hero , what shall we do ?
both seized their lances , wrenched them from the shields and went for each other now like lions rending flesh or a pair of wild boars whose power never flags
pirous who heaved the rock came rushing in and speared him up the navel — his bowels uncoiled , spilling loose on the ground and the dark came swirling down across his eyes
but hector , at least , will never ride behind you , you and your blazoned chariot
flat on his back he went , slamming against the ground and his killer stripped the armor brazen ares gave him
look , the sharp stakes jutting right at the edge , and just beyond that the achaeans ' sturdy rampart
drag it inside the walls , he urges , plant it high on the city heights !
as a lion charges cattle , calves and heifers browsing the deep glades and snaps their necks , so tydides pitched them both from the chariot , gave them a mauling — gave them little choice — quickly stripped their gear and passed their team to his men to lash back to the ships
my limbs are gnarled now , the old power 's gone
their fleet is massed on the shore and a low roar grows , men crying for battle-standards now , but an aged prophet holds them back , singing out his song of destiny : you elite lydian troops , fine flower of courage born of an ancient race , oh , what just resentment whips you into battle !
here dardanus was born
so odysseus prayed and hoisting the spoils over his head , heaved them onto a tamarisk bush nearby and against it heaped a good clear landmark , clumping together reeds and fresh tamarisk boughs they would never miss as they ran back through the rushing dark night
tomorrow i will return to you with the rising sun , bearing splendid arms from hephaestus , god of fire !
the victor king was still building his city , argyripa , named for his father ’ s argive stock— in iapyx ’ realm , the fields round mount garganus
nor do i make war with your people
so either side of the lines they took positions , weighing tactics , each olympian force reluctant now to launch out first on the wrenching horrors of war
this day first gave you to war and this day takes you off and still you leave behind great heaps of latian dead
so intense , that iulus was first to welcome both , inviting hyrtacus ’ son to speak , and so he did : men of aeneas , hear us out with open minds , don ’ t judge what we say by our young years
follow us , come , so we can wake the next man , some captain fit to map our strategy here , whether we break and run or stand and fight
lucky man , if only he ’ d stretched his gambling through the night and played it out till dawn !
now zeus hands us a day worth all the rest , today we seize these ships — they stormed ashore against the will of the gods , they came here freighted with years of pain for us , and all thanks to our city elders
the driver eurymedon freed the old man 's team
bring that man into range and let me spear him !
next in the offing acragas rears , steep city , once a famous breeder of fiery steeds , and shows its mighty ramparts
and i , i last of all — the dogs before my doors will eat me raw , once some enemy brings me down with his sharp bronze sword or spits me with a spear , wrenching the life out of my body , yes , the very dogs i bred in my own halls to share my table , guard my gates — mad , rabid at heart they will lap their master 's blood and loll before my doors
the noble son of hippolochus answered staunchly , high-hearted son of tydeus , why ask about my birth ?
— with what a load of misery lifted from my spirit
just as the sun began to strike the plowlands , rising out of the deep calm flow of the ocean river to climb the vaulting sky , the opposing armies met
now if he heard how all cringe in the face of hector , time and again he would stretch his hands to the gods and pray that life breath would quit his limbs and sink to the house of death
and iris racing the wind went veering off as achilles , zeus 's favorite fighter , rose up now and over his powerful shoulder pallas slung the shield , the tremendous storm-shield with all its tassels flaring — and crowning his head the goddess swept a golden cloud and from it she lit a fire to blaze across the field
hector aflash in arms took up his horsehair-crested helmet once again
then , tomorrow at first light , we will decide whether we sail home or hold out here
still the achaeans never would have yielded before the prince 's charge if paris the lord of lovely fair-haired helen had not put a stop to machaon 's gallant fighting , striking the healer squarely with an arrow triple-flanged that gouged his right shoulder
but zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied , god of the earthquake , well you know my plans , the strategy in my mind , and why i call you here
the rest repair the thwarts , replace the charred beams with new ship timbers , refit the oars and cables ; no large troop , but their spirits burn for war
taking his stand , right in the milling troops , the herald called out in a high , firm voice , son of atreus !
they light the lamps , hung from the coffered ceilings sheathed in gilt , and blazing torches burn the night away
noble oeneus hosted your brave bellerophon once , he held him there in his halls , twenty whole days , and they gave each other handsome gifts of friendship
that was his cry as hector put fresh fighting spirit in each man
my son , he says , so pressed by the fate of troy— cassandra alone made such a prophecy to me
but there on the god-built heights stood aged priam
all of them struggle there to defend their walls , some with javelins , some with rocks or flinging blazing torches , nocking arrows to bowstrings
again a stranger bride , a marriage with a stranger once again
and now glaucus son of hippolochus and tydeus ' son diomedes met in the no man 's land between both armies : burning for battle , closing , squaring off and the lord of the war cry diomedes opened up , who are you , my fine friend ?
hera queen of the gods , daughter of giant cronus launched the work , harnessed the golden-bridled team while athena , child of zeus whose shield is thunder , letting fall her supple robe at the father 's threshold — rich brocade , stitched with her own hands ' labor — donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning , buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war
odysseus left them dead and skewered hippasus ' son , one charops the blood brother of wealthy socus but socus moved in quick as a god to shield his kin , standing up to his enemy , crying out , odysseus — wild for fame , glutton for cunning , glutton for war , today you can triumph over the two sons of hippasus , killing such good men and stripping off their gear — or beaten down by my spear you will breathe your last !
what ’ s worse , as the young virgin lavinia lit the altar with pure torches , flanking her father , look—what horror ! —her flowing hair caught fire , her lovely regalia crackled in the flames , her regal tresses blazed , her crown blazing , studded with flashing jewels—the next moment the girl was engulfed in a smoky yellow glare , strewing the god of fire ’ s power through the house
the carthaginians calm their fiery temper and queen dido , above all , takes to heart a spirit of peace and warm good will to meet the men of troy
but now acestes rebukes entellus sharply , sitting side by side on a grassy rise of ground : entellus , once our bravest hero , where ’ s it gone ?
magus begged no more as aeneas lashed back : all those bars of silver and gold you brag of , save them for your sons !
father anchises , barely pausing , gives the man his hand and the friendly gesture lifts the stranger ’ s spirits
swinging their prows around to face the sea , they moor the fleet with the anchors ’ biting grip and the curved sterns edge the bay
there sleep came to a halt — before the eyes of the father could detect him — and climbed up softly into a towering pine tree
today an illustrious son is born to rule the argives
ah but then , when the happy spring brought time for payment round , that outrageous man laomedon robbed us blind
now listen to what i ’ m mulling over , what new plan is shaping in my mind
you have forgotten me , my friend
and time and again the tyrians burst into applause and the trojans took their lead
but tlepolemus ' shaft had struck sarpedon too , the honed tip of the weapon hitting his left thigh , ferocious , razoring into flesh and scraping bone but his father beat off death a little longer
true , but the life that 's left me will be long , the stroke of death will not come on me quickly
both men armed at opposite sides of the forces , into the ring they strode and met , burning for battle , glances menacing , wild excitement seizing all their comrades
why , i just left beroë now , sick and bitter to be the only one deprived of our lavish rites , denied her part in the honors paid anchises
the law forbids me to carry living bodies across in my stygian boat
but that is not my way
but iasus became a captain of athens ' troops , sphelus ' son he was called and bucolus ' grandson
and round his back diomedes slung the hide of a big tawny lion , swinging down to his heels , he grasped a spear and the fighter strode away and roused those men to leave their beds and march
what terror has driven one or the other side to rush to arms and rouse their enemies ’ swords ?
with that , over my broad shoulders and round my neck i spread a tawny lion ’ s skin for a cloak , and bowing down , i lift my burden up
so he roused the fury in battling ajax ' heart and down the front he stalked with the red-haired king
he harangued the immortals hanging on his words : hear me , all you gods and all goddesses too , as i proclaim what the heart inside me urges
they were struck with awe as father anchises paused , then carried on : look there , marcellus marching toward us , decked in splendid plunder he tore from a chief he killed , victorious , towering over all
the dirge rises up
now , long ablaze as he was to fight the trojans , triple the fury seized him — claw-mad as a lion some shepherd tending woolly flocks in the field has just grazed , a lion leaping into the fold , but he has not killed him , only spurred his strength and helpless to beat him off the man scurries for shelter , leaving his flocks panicked , lost as the ramping beast mauls them thick-and-fast , piling corpse on corpse and in one furious bound clears the fenced yard — so raging diomedes mauled the trojans
as a huge oak goes down at a stroke from father zeus , ripped up by the roots and a grim reek of sulphur bursts forth from the trunk and a passerby too close , looking on , loses courage — the bolt of mighty zeus is hell on earth — so in a flash , for all his fighting power , hector plunged in the dust , his spear dropped from his fist , shield and helmet crushing in on him , bronze gear clashing round him
but there was a man among the troops , one dolon , a son of the sacred trojan herald eumedes
but glaucus , hippolochus ' son and lord of lycia 's forces now , scowled at hector , lashing out at him : hector — our prince of beauty , in battle all a sham !
so veteran troops kept swarming round that corpse , never pausing — nor did mighty zeus for a moment turn his shining eyes from the clash of battle
with boundless timber piled on all sides of the place , down they sat , waiting , massed
the sibyl , seeing the serpents writhe around his neck , tossed him a sop , slumbrous with honey and drugged seed , and he , frothing with hunger , three jaws spread wide , snapped it up where the sibyl tossed it—gone
why does your son attack me , whip my waters more than all the others ?
o father zeus — draw our armies clear of the cloud , give us a bright sky , give us back our sight !
this the italians watch , enthralled as the birds all scream and swerving round in flight—a marvel , look—they overshadow the sky with wings , and forming a dense cloudbank , force their enemy high up through the air until , beaten down by their strikes and his victim ’ s weight , his talons dropped the kill in the river ’ s run and into the clouds the eagle winged away
when arcadia 's champion ereuthalion strode forth , a man like a god for power , his shoulders decked with king areithous ' armor , massive areithous
not so loud the breakers bellowing out against the shore , driven in from open sea by the north wind 's brutal blast , not so loud the roar of fire whipped to a crackling blaze rampaging into a mountain gorge , raging up through timber , not so loud the gale that howls in the leafy crowns of oaks when it hits its pitch of fury tearing branches down — nothing so loud as cries of trojans , cries of achaeans , terrible war cries , armies storming against each other
they say you are a son of aphrodite , zeus 's daughter , but achilles sprang from a lesser goddess ' loins — aphrodite 's a child of zeus , thetis comes from the old man of the sea
around him trusted comrades swung to the work , preparing breakfast , steadying in their midst a large fleecy sheep just slaughtered in the shelter
come , up with you now , climb aboard my chariot !
his looks , his words , they pierce her heart and cling— no peace , no rest for her body , love will give her none
they can not hold their line , not if the ropes of death are knotted round their necks !
but since the gods ordained it all , these desperate years , i wish i had been the wife of a better man , someone alive to outrage , the withering scorn of men
you must give way
and the sort you use is just the sort you will hear
hector bore his round shield in the forefront , blazing out like the dog star through the clouds , all withering fire , then plunging back in the cloud-rack massed and dark — so hector ranged on , now flaring along the front , now shouting his orders back toward the rear , all of him armed in bronze aflash like lightning flung by father zeus with his battle-shield of thunder
he was like the man to the life , every feature , the same tall build and the fine eyes and voice and the very robes that used to clothe his body
bearing down beneath the rush of the west wind and miles away he sees it building black as pitch , blacker , whipping the whitecaps , full hurricane fury — the herdsman shudders to see it , drives his flocks to a cave — so dense the battalions grouped behind the two aeantes , packed , massed with hardy fighters dear to the gods , battalions black and bristling shields and spears , fighters sweeping into the breaking storm of war
antilochus came in last and carried off his prize with a broad smile and a joke to warm his comrades : i will tell you something you have always known , my friends — down to this very day the gods prefer old-timers
what other warmth , what comfort 's left for me , once you have met your doom ?
but they still kept swarming round and round the corpse like flies in a sheepfold buzzing over the brimming pails in the first spring days when the buckets flood with milk
you know how the furies always stand by older brothers
patroclus — wherever he saw the biggest masses dashing before him , there he steered , plowing ahead with savage cries and fighters tumbled out of their chariots headfirst , crushed under their axles , war-cars crashing over , yes , but straight across the trench went his own careering team at a superhuman bound
whatever can be done
and there in the heart of battle mars rampages on , cast in iron , with grim furies plunging down the sky and strife in triumph rushing in with her slashed robes and bellona cracking her bloody lash in hot pursuit
or in my immortal rage i may just toss you over , hate you as i adore you now — with a vengeance
can such rage inflame the immortals ’ hearts ?
shaped like the runner acamas , prince of thrace , ares challenged the sons of priam with a vengeance : you royal sons of priam , monarch dear to the gods , how long will you let achaeans massacre your army ?
back it rears , flailing the air with flying hoofs and throwing its rider , pitching headlong down in a tangled mass , it ’ s shoulder-joint torn out , it crushes mezentius ’ body to the ground
but achaea 's warlords clustered round achilles , begging him to eat
bursting in rage against the gods , she bore a sister for coeus and enceladus : rumor , quicksilver afoot and swift on the wing , a monster , horrific , huge and under every feather on her body—what a marvel— an eye that never sleeps and as many tongues as eyes and as many raucous mouths and ears pricked up for news
the men who trooped with hector and prince polydamas — they were the greatest force , the best and bravest , grim set above all the rest to breach the wall and go for the beaked ships and fight it out
but now , look , he 's leading the trojan rampage , his pledges thrown to the winds !
and the steady , long-enduring odysseus replied , great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , that man has no intention of quenching his rage
but hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer , suddenly bursting out , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
turnus adds to their anguish , quietly moving toward the altar , eyes downcast , to pray
nestor grasped the glistening reins in both fists , lashed the team and they charged straight at hector charging straight at them as tydides hurled a spear and missed his man but he picked the driver off , eniopeus son of proud thebaeus gripping the reins — he slashed him beside the nipple , stabbed his chest and off the car he pitched , his horses balking , rearing
they escorted him home to troy — saved , past all their hopes — while far across the field the achaean men-at-arms escorted ajax , thrilled with victory , back to agamemnon
and now hector would have hauled the body away and won undying glory
let him get past us first , into the clear a bit , then rush him and overtake him double-quick !
but have no fear of death , no dread in your heart , such a powerful escort will conduct you — the giant-killer hermes will guide you all the way to achilles ' presence
seven citadels i will give him , filled with people , cardamyle , enope , and the grassy slopes of hire , pherae the sacrosanct , anthea deep in meadows , rolling aepea and pedasus green with vineyards
i erected the rampart round the trojans ' city , a massive ashlar wall to make the place impregnable
then over his shoulder paris slung his sword , the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt , and then the shield-strap and his sturdy , massive shield and over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror , and last he grasped a spear that matched his grip
or under my own roof i may not spare your life , old man — suppliant that you are — may break the laws of zeus !
his life is doomed by the fates but now he tests his luck for the quickest way in
then , terrified by her fate , tragic dido prays for death , sickened to see the vaulting sky above her
you should have called me on to the same fate
wild as a boulder plowing headlong down from a summit , torn out by the tempests—whether the stormwinds washed it free or the creeping years stole under it , worked it loose , down the cliff it crashes , ruthless crag of rock bounding over the ground with enormous impact , churning up in its onrush woods and herds and men
no joy had he known from her for all his gifts , the full hundred oxen he gave her on the spot then promised a thousand head of goats and sheep from the boundless herds he would rounded up himself
but both fighters will share this armor , bear it off , and we will give them a victor 's banquet in our tents
her eyes lowered , dido replies with a few choice words of welcome : cast fear to the winds , trojans , free your minds
but they pick by lot the best , most able-bodied men and stealthily lock them into the horse ’ s dark flanks till the vast hold of the monster ’ s womb is packed with soldiers bristling weapons
and over across from him patroclus slept with the sashed and lovely iphis by his side , whom prince achilles gave him the day he took the heights of scyros , enyeus ' rocky stronghold
the famous name of the queen holds out its shield , and the hero wins support for his many feats , his trophies won in war
hector leapt to ground from his chariot fully armed and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face : but against their mass the argives closed ranks , the fighting about to break , the troops squaring off and atrides , tense to outfight them all , charged first
hold back no more
both champions , belted tight , stepped into the ring , squared off at each other and let loose , trading jabs with their clenched fists then slugged it out — flurries of jolting punches , terrific grinding of jaws , sweat rivering , bodies glistening — suddenly euryalus glanced for an opening , dropped his guard and epeus hurled his smashing roundhouse hook to the head — a knockout blow !
for i must go home to see my people first , to visit my own dear wife and my baby son
under his ear great ajax stabbed with a heavy lance , wrenched the weapon out and down he went like a tall ash on a landmark mountain ridge that glistens far and wide — chopped down by an ax , its leaves running with sap , strewn across the earth
once they reached athena 's shrine on the city crest the beauty theano opened the doors to let them in , cisseus ' daughter , the horseman antenor 's wife and athena 's priestess chosen by the trojans
but pallas forbids them to cut short the rites , and fearless , seizes a spear and runs to confront the new arrivals by himself
he who gave that prize has snatched it back again — what outrage !
now with the gifts presented , all were moving off , proud of their prizes , scarlet ribbons binding their brows when here comes sergestus , bringing in his ship
but then the gods of heaven brought this agony on you — ceaseless battles round your walls , your armies slaughtered
we follow you , blessed god , whoever you are— glad at heart we obey your commands once more
but look , who is that over there , crowned with an olive wreath and bearing sacred emblems ?
he 's wounded me off guard and now he triumphs — he boasts i wo not look long on the light of day
no less in another zone the grieving latins raise up countless pyres too
now amid the din , as the fiery controversy flared , look , to top it off , the grim-set envoys enter , bearing the news from diomedes ’ noble city : nothing has been won , for all our attempts
turning your back in battle like some coward !
take my advice and wipe it from your mind , good as your message is — you are in my hands now
when he caught some common soldier shouting out , he would beat him with the scepter , dress him down : you fool — sit still !
now squad on squad , gate to gate they fought — but how can i tell it all , sing it all like a god ?
many the sons i had whom the swift runner achilles caught and shipped on the barren salt sea as slaves to samos , to imbros , to lemnos shrouded deep in mist !
so aeneas pleaded , his face streaming tears
never refuse to bow to my commands
and he rose up tall and challenged all the achaeans : now two come forward — fight to win this prize !
if losers win such prizes , nisus erupted now , and the ones who trip , such pity—what gift will you give to nisus worth his salt ?
but zeus would not fulfill their prayers , not yet
on with the fighting , quickly !
but even so , my sister , carry out for me one great favor in my pain
her quiver is gold , her hair drawn up in a golden torque and a golden buckle clasps her purple robe in folds
and i had given my own life , and the long last march brought me , not pallas , home !
but the gods wo not give us all their gifts at once
we will deal with all this later , in due time
so the cephallenians held their ground there , poised
and let him give you his own fine armor to wear in war so the trojans might take you for him , patroclus , yes , hold off from attack , and achaea 's fighting sons get second wind , exhausted as they are
there were fifty fast black ships that bore his troops when achilles dear to zeus sailed east for troy
who ’ ll take word to aeneas ?
yes , but all night long the master strategist zeus plotted fresh disaster for both opposing armies — his thunder striking terror — and blanching panic swept across the ranks
what do we need with wrangling , hurling insults ?
achates , following orders , hurries toward the ships
so he left his feet and down he went — out cold — but big-hearted epeus hoisted him in his arms and stood him upright
he had barely touched the prow when juno bursts the cables , rips the ship from her moorings , blows her out to sea on the tide ebbing fast
the old horseman peleus had me escort you , that day he sent you out of phthia to agamemnon , a youngster still untrained for the great leveler , war , still green at debate where men can make their mark
not even achilles who smashes whole battalions — he would never yield to him in a stand-up fight though in downfield racing none can touch the man
and diomedes lord of the war cry prayed aloud , hear me , daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder , tireless one , athena !
they were afraid , they held the king in awe and stood there , silent
as the fighter tore it out the blood came gushing forth and his heart sank
i love her like no one else !
drop those bloody spoils !
come , let the heralds cry out to all contingents , full battle-armor , muster the men along the ships
and now the exultant argives seized the chance to drag patroclus ' body quickly out of range and laid him on a litter
the fiery sun had climbed to mid-career when , off in the distance , they catch sight of walls , a citadel , scattered roofs of houses : all that now the imperial power of rome has lifted to the skies , but then what evander held , his humble kingdom
the fighter had no idea at all that famous gifts of the gods do not break lightly , ca not be crushed when a mortal hand assails them
but hector saw them and called at once to aeneas posted close beside him , aeneas , counselor of the trojans armed in bronze , i can see the great runner achilles ' team — look there — heading into the fight but reined by feeble drivers
one of us would have lived , the one whom mars— or his own right arm—had granted life
misenus , aeolus ’ son , a herald unsurpassed at rallying troops with his trumpet ’ s cry , igniting the god of war with its shrill blare
an ingot big enough to keep the winner in iron for five wheeling years
child of zeus whose battle-shield is thunder , tireless one , athena — what , is this the way ?
he shouts in hot pursuit , flashing his naked sword , blind to the winds that scatter all his triumph
so , my arrow failed to bring you down , my tearing shot ?
just as the two men closed , heading into each other , atrides missed — his spearshaft hooking off to the side — pisander stabbed his shield but the bronze could not bore through — the huge hide blocked it , the shaft snapped at the socket
wherever the richest land of green calydon lay , there they urged him to choose a grand estate , full fifty acres , half of it turned to vineyards , half to open plowland , and carve it from the plain
never would he repay his loving parents now for the gift of rearing — his life cut short so soon , brought down by the spear of lionhearted ajax
he knew them both , he would seen them once by the ships when the swift achilles dragged them in from ida
why so hard to starboard ?
the olympian lord of lightning — what if he would like to blast us from our seats ?
turnus amidst them , proud in his chariot , puffed up with his new success , spurring the war-lust on !
but men who held the center suffered agonies , thanks to the haze and carnage — ruthless bronze hacking their lines to pieces , there where the bravest fought
he lays unlucky acron low , his heels pounding the dark earth as he gasps his life away and dyes the weapon splintered off in his body blood-red
their proud discipline gripped them , terror too — they rallied each other , nonstop , war cries rising
what can nisus do ?
night , drawn by the hours , approaches mid-career when palinurus , on the alert , leaps up from bed to test the winds , his ears keen for the first stir , scanning the constellations wheeling down the quiet sky , arcturus , the rainy hyades and the great and little bears , his eyes roving to find orion geared in gold
i heard her voice with my own ears , i looked straight at the goddess , face-to-face
whatever verses the seer writes down on leaves she puts in order , sealed in her cave , left behind
hera 's urgings , i trust , have made you suffer this
phrygian blood will corrupt our own , and i , i ’ m driven from the doors !
deiphobus ' mind was torn — should he pull back and call a friend to his side , some hardy trojan , or take the argive on alone ?
life or death — now prove yourself a spearman , a daring man of war !
not aeneas alone but flanked by antenor 's two sons , acamas and archelochus , trained for every foray
he 's stripped , naked — hector with that flashing helmet , hector has your arms !
but still the breakneck trojans , up in arms as they were , killed off none of the argives with their spears — instead they began to drag away patroclus ' corpse
like flocks of sheep in a wealthy rancher 's steadings , thousands crowding to have their white milk drained , bleating nonstop when they hear their crying lambs — so the shouts rose up from the long trojan lines and not one cry , no common voice to bind them all together , their tongues mixed and clashed , their men hailed from so many far-flung countries
and the cretan captains form a ring around him
would to god my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw — such agonies you have caused me !
so then , when those terrible , monstrous omens burst in on the victims we were offering to the gods , calchas swiftly revealed the will of zeus : 'why struck dumb now , my long-haired achaeans ?
atrides went on the run and reached him , shouting , ajax !
the trojan crews had laughed when he took the plunge , then when he floundered round and now they laugh as he retches spews of brine from his heaving chest
his heart was racing — what could he do to help him ?
my hopes are rising now — i pray to zeus and the great array of deathless gods that we will whip the achaeans howling out of troy and drive them off to death , those dogs of war the deadly fates drove here in their black ships !
and jove almighty , and you , his queen , saturnia— goddess , be kinder now , i pray you , now at last !
take a message home to evander , tell him this : the pallas i send him back will serve him right !
for company , two watchdogs go loping on before him over the high doorsill , friends to their master ’ s steps
the rest of his flesh seemed all encased in armor , burnished , brazen — achilles ' armor that hector stripped from strong patroclus when he killed him — true , but one spot lay exposed , where collarbones lift the neckbone off the shoulders , the open throat , where the end of life comes quickest — there as hector charged in fury brilliant achilles drove his spear and the point went stabbing clean through the tender neck but the heavy bronze weapon failed to slash the windpipe — hector could still gasp out some words , some last reply
and coming to meet them , marching from the camp , the great founder , aeneas , source of the roman race , with his blazoned starry shield and armor made in heaven
first he cracks its neck , clamped in his huge jaws , mauling the kill then down in gulps he bolts it , blood and guts , and around him dogs and shepherds raise a fierce din but they keep their distance , lacking nerve to go in and take the lion on — the fear that grips their spirit makes them blanch
and then , if a man reveres these daughters of zeus as they draw near him , they will help him greatly and listen to his appeals
but if you are serious , speaking from the heart , the gods themselves have blotted out your senses
or would you rather settle here in my realm on equal terms with me ?
whom do we follow ?
what insanity ’ s this that shifts my fixed resolve ?
the heart in his rugged chest was pounding , torn
sing them yourself , i beg you !
but if you hang back from the grueling battle now , your day has dawned to be crushed by trojans
neither idomeneus nor agamemnon dared stand his ground , nor did the great and little ajax , old campaigners , nestor alone held out , the noble horseman , achaea 's watch and ward , but not of his own will
no achaean in sight will knock me out and take her — i am the greatest !
euneus son of jason gave it to prince patroclus , the ransom paid to release lycaon , priam 's son
he had just grasped the corpse when shining hector smashed his head with a rock and his whole skull split in his massive helmet — down he slammed on sarpedon 's body , facefirst and courage-shattering death engulfed his corpse
one you killed in the ranks of frontline fighters , noble polydorus , ran him down with your lance and a gruesome death awaits me here and now — no hope of escape for me , from your clutches , not when destiny drives me up against you
now this approach , now that , exploring the circuit round from every side , he shakes his fatal spear in his ruthless fist
so , father , at least fulfill this prayer for me : let the men escape with their lives if nothing else — do not let these trojans mow us down in droves !
aeneas springs to the entryway and rinsing his limbs with fresh pure water , there at the threshold , just before them , stakes the golden bough
but i , i wo not stop killing these overweening trojans , not till i have packed them in their walls and tested hector , strength against strength — he kills me or i kill him !
standing by me always , in every combat mission — no maneuver of mine slips by you — now , again , give me your best support , athena , comrade !
the lord of men agamemnon reassured him : nestor , son of neleus , glory of achaea , do not you recognize agamemnon ?
the comrades , too , bring on what gifts they can , their spirits high , loading the altars , killing steers , while others , setting the bronze cauldrons out in order , stretch along the grass , holding spits over embers , broiling cuts of meat
what plans are they mapping , what maneuvers next ?
are you still married to pyrrhus ?
like him to the life , the deadly archer taunted , hector , what achaean will ever fear you now ?
but at long last menelaus leapt up and spoke , lashing out at them , groaning , heartsick : oh no — your threats , your bluster — women , not men of achaea !
they need not fear our stealing up on them in the dark like skulking cowards to rob them of their palladium , butcher their sentries posted on the heights
a nightmare — i fear it , with all my heart — i fear the gods will carry out his threats and then it will be our fate to die in troy , far from the stallion-land of argos
but dauntless turnus never loses faith in his daring , he flares up more at his men , inflaming their spirits more : all these omens threaten the trojans !
king osinius sailed her here , straight from the shores of clusium
from that point on i plan my tactics , give commands to grant the argives breathing room in battle
abandon the gods ' high road and be a mortal !
i have covered him over , sent him into a deep , soothing sleep as soon as hera seduced great zeus to lose himself in love
i thought he was at my side , the hero deiphobus — he 's safe inside the walls , athena 's tricked me blind
and yours too , menelaus — look at this cloud of war that blots out all the field , this hector , this headlong death that stares us in the face !
he bore evander ’ s arms in arcadia once , but the omens were less bright when he marched out with pallas , beloved foster-son
charioteers swung chariots round , thrust the powerful fist of fury straight ahead and murderous ares keen to help the trojans shrouded the carnage over in dense dark night — lunging at all points , carrying out the commands of phoebus apollo , lord of the golden sword , who ordered ares to whip the trojans ' war-lust once he spotted athena veering off the lines , great pallas who would rushed to back the argives
surely no achaean will curse me , seeing me now , giving ground to hector
best to yield to night
they heaped a single great barrow over the corpse-fire , one great communal grave stretched out across the plain and fronting it threw up looming ramparts quickly , a landward wall for ships and troops themselves , and amidst the wall built gateways fitted strong to open a clear path for driving chariots through
now at the same moment jove , the king of mighty olympus , turns to juno , gazing down on the war from her golden cloud , and says : where will it end , my queen ?
achilles threatens , tomorrow at first light , to haul his well-benched warships out to sea
our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of argos , the land of achaea where the women are a wonder
there your house , the line of aeneas , will rule all parts of the world— your sons ’ sons and all their descendants down the years
with that he loosed a shrill cry to his trojans , trojans !
but if he 's the man i think he is , tydeus ' gallant son , he rages so with a god beside him — not alone , no — a god with his shoulders shrouded round in cloud who deflects my shaft to a less mortal spot
and hera the queen , her dark eyes wide , exclaimed , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
heroic sarpedon — his loyal comrades bore him out of the fighting quickly , weighed down by the heavy spearshaft dragging on
how furious father was with me , over his mistress with her dark , glistening hair
enemy weapons beating against him , worse , he dreaded the trojans too , swarming round him , a tough ring of them , brave and bristling spears , massing , rearing over their comrade 's body now and rugged , strong and proud as the great ajax was , they shoved him back — he gave ground , staggering , reeling
that much room for indulgence i will give you
the battalions gathered quickly
then he would yoke his racing team to the chariot-harness , lash the corpse of hector behind the car for dragging and haul him three times round the dead patroclus ' tomb , and then he would rest again in his tents and leave the body sprawled facedown in the dust
by your own brave work exalt our trojan greatness to the skies
the armies grouping now — as seasoned goatherds split their wide-ranging flocks into packs with ease when herds have mixed together down the pasture : so the captains formed their tight platoons , detaching right and left , moving up for action — and there in the midst strode powerful agamemnon , eyes and head like zeus who loves the lightning , great in the girth like ares , god of battles , broad through the chest like sea lord poseidon
next , from the marsian stock a priest came marching in , his helmet crowned with a leafy olive spray : sent by king archippus , umbro , no man braver , an old hand , with his touch and spells , at shedding sleep on the vipers ’ spawn and lake-snakes hissing death , at soothing their anger , healing bites with his magic arts
and now , as soon as the two drove past the great tomb of ilus they drew rein at the ford to water mules and team
they still camped on the slopes of ida wet with springs
we lived in our halls together , prized the man as we prize our beloved parents — hector 's killed him !
first he leaves astern sergestus struggling still at his beetling rock , splashing in shallows , crying for help—no use— as he studies how to race with shattered oars
he is no poor man who owns what they have won , not strapped for goods with all that lovely gold — what trophies those high-strung horses carried off for me !
the brisk commands he issued pleased them all
all the while neptune sensed the furor above him , the roaring seas first and the storm breaking next—his standing waters boiling up from the sea-bed , churning back
but now it 's for you to dodge my brazen spear — i wish you would bury it in your body to the hilt
the vast plains of the sea are yours to plow until you reach hesperian land , where lydian tiber flows with its smooth march through rich and loamy fields , a land of hardy people
and amata mid them all , shaking a flaming brand of pine , breaks into a marriage hymn for turnus and her daughter— rolling her bloodshot eyes she suddenly bursts out , wildly : mothers of latium , listen , wherever you are , if any love for unlucky amata still stirs your hearts , your loyal hearts—if any care for a mother ’ s rights still cuts you to the quick , loose your headbands , seize on the orgies with me !
he adds horses too , pilots to guide our way , fills out our crews , rearms our fighting comrades
mnestheus commands the dragon swift with her eager crew , mnestheus soon of italy , soon from him the memmian clan would take its name
he will leave those men in a flash , achaeans , trojans , overweening trojans , and back great zeus will come to batter us on olympus , seize one after another — gods guilty and innocent routed all together
unknowing let him stay there !
and there in the midst achilles stood like the god of war , urging his charioteers and fighters bracing shields
so he wept and prayed and his noble mother heard him , seated near her father , the old man of the sea in the salt green depths
the lord of men agamemnon shuddered , frightened to see the dark blood gushing from the wound
her eyes afire the goddess pallas did not resist a moment
challenge away , i beg you
as when some lion overpowers a tireless wild boar up on a mountain summit , battling in all their fury over a little spring of water , both beasts craving to slake their thirst , but the lion beats him down with sheer brute force as the boar fights for breath — so now with a close thrust hector the son of priam tore the life from the fighting son of menoetius , from patroclus who had killed so many men in war , and gloried over him , wild winging words : patroclus — surely you must have thought you would storm my city down , you would wrest from the wives of troy their day of freedom , drag them off in ships to your own dear fatherland — you fool !
he shook his head and addressed his own deep heart : poor creatures , why did we give you to king peleus , a mortal doomed to death
here is the ancient line of teucer , noblest stock of all , those great-hearted heroic sons born in better years , ilus , and assaracus , and dardanus , founder of troy
here , under steep roofs in the dark night , turnus , dead to the world , lay fast asleep
once the huntsmen have reached the trackless lairs aloft in the foothills , suddenly , look , some wild goats flushed from a ridge come scampering down the slopes and lower down a herd of stags goes bounding across the open country , ranks massed in a cloud of dust , fleeing the high ground
all you argives flying home to your fatherland , tumbling into your oar-swept ships ?
greater than any man on earth , greater in outrage too — for the gods themselves are always at your side !
at the fever ’ s first attack with its clammy poison still stealing over the queen , trickling through her wits and twining her bones with fire— before her mind was seized by the flames within her spirit she could still speak softly , a mother ’ s tender way , sobbing over her daughter ’ s marriage to a phrygian : so , lavinia goes in wedlock to these trojans—exiles ?
and with that command zeus roused incessant battle
but odysseus fine at tactics answered firmly , not so quickly , brave as you are , godlike achilles
whoever brought this war on both our countries , let him rot and sink to the house of death — but let our pacts of friendship all hold fast !
wait , would you like to see the tarquin kings , the overweening spirit of brutus the avenger , the fasces he reclaims ?
so now not a single trojan fighter had the spine to go and face atrides tensing in all his strength
inspired by the signs and their own raw power all pitched in to smash the achaeans ' massive wall
only estrange yourself from me a little more — and all the worse for you
if you ever stood by father with all your love amidst the blaze of battle , stand by me — do me a favor now , athena
a single pine beam held the gates , and it took three men to ram it home , three to shoot the immense bolt back and spread the doors — three average men
the grisly swamp and its loveless , lethal waters bind them fast , styx with its nine huge coils holds them captive
how can he save his young friend— what force , weapons , what bold stroke ?
and here are men to confirm it , fellow envoys
never a fear of me — far from the fighting as i was — you fool !
primordial earth and juno , queen of marriage , give the signal and lightning torches flare and the high sky bears witness to the wedding , nymphs on the mountaintops wail out the wedding hymn
pounding it in his palms , he crushed a bitter root and covered over the gash to kill his comrade 's pain , a cure that fought off every kind of pain
one favor now , i pray you
with that he clasped the old king by the wrist , by the right hand , to free his heart from fear
i rate that man the luckiest one among us , first in the work of war , first in strength of heart , who spurning the sight of our surrender , falls , dying , and bites the dust for one last time
he asked automedon , ready aide , to bring the breastplate from his tents
go , range the ranks of achaeans armed in bronze
that 's the pain that wounds me , suffering such humiliation
but hector cut down schedius now , perimedes ' son , a phocian chieftain — and ajax killed laodamas , captain of infantry , antenor 's splendid son — and polydamas killed cyllenian otus outright , meges ' friend , one of the proud epeans ' leaders
comrades below , posted in close-packed ranks , block the entries , swordpoints drawn and poised
awesome and quick to anger , the man who sent me here to find out who 's been wounded , the one you have just brought in
what ’ s held you back so long ?
shrill shouts hitting the heavens , fighters racing for home , knocking the blocks out underneath the hulls
no hunter could spot a trace that led toward that cave
and nestor the noble driver answered warmly , right you are , my friend , straight to the point
you , the noble son of a proud maeonian house , where the farmhands work the loamy soil and pactolus floods the fields with gold
hera might catch us here
the harbor curves like a bow , bent by eastern combers , rocky breakwaters foam with the salt surf spray , the haven ’ s just behind them
yet they can ’ t hold out
look what heavy casualties you have suffered just for me , my violent quarrel , and paris who brought it on you all
he knew her at once—his mother— and called after her now as she sped away : why , you too , cruel as the rest ?
either my right arm will send that dardan down to hell , that rank deserter of asia—my armies can sit back and watch , and turnus ’ sword alone will rebut the charge of cowardice trained against them all
at last she assails aeneas , before he ’ s said a word : so , you traitor , you really believed you ’ d keep this a secret , this great outrage ?
stop concocting this panic for me , please
as crosswinds chop the sea where the fish swarm , the north wind and the west wind blasting out of thrace in sudden , lightning attack , wave on blacker wave , cresting , heaving a tangled mass of seaweed out along the surf — so the achaeans ' hearts were torn inside their chests
seek a city for them , once you have roved the seas , erect great walls at last to house the gods of troy !
then i will build you a solid marble temple , apollo and diana , establish hallowed days , apollo , in your name
gaining that landfall , making port , what do we see but sleek lusty herds of cattle grazing the plains , flocks of goats unguarded , cropping grassland ?
but meges did hit croesmus , stabbed him square in the chest with a thrusting-lance and down he crashed — with meges tearing the armor off his back as the trojan dolops lunged at him
they all stood silent , trading startled glances fixed on each other , hushed
book fifteen : the achaean armies at bay
down from ida 's peaks he swooped like a hawk , the killer of doves , the fastest thing on wings
just in range are the snow-white canvas tents of rhesus— he knows them at once , and sobs—rhesus ’ men betrayed in their first slumber , droves of them slaughtered by diomedes splattered with their blood , lashing back to the greek camp their high-strung teams before they could ever savor the grass of troy or drink at xanthus ’ banks
how doomed you are , look — far from your loved ones and native land — to glut with your shining fat the wild dogs of battle here in troy
their mourning was over now as jove from high heaven , gazing down on the sea , the whitecaps winged with sails , the lands outspread , the coasts , the nations of the earth , paused at the zenith of the sky and set his sights on libya , that proud kingdom
then onto the flaming chariot pallas set her feet and seized her spear — weighted , heavy , the massive shaft she wields to break the battle lines of heroes the mighty father 's daughter storms against
then father almighty , enraged that any mortal rise from the shades below , return to the light of life , jove with his lightning bolt struck down apollo ’ s son who honed such healing skills , down to the styx ’ s flood
trust me — we will face disaster
i come from the axius ' broad currents — axius floods the land with the clearest stream on earth and axius fathered the famous spearman pelegon
for there is a man i will enrage — i see it now — a powerful man who lords it over all the argives , one the achaeans must obey
and with that threat the god of the sea-blue mane led the way to the fortress raised for godlike heracles : earth piled on both sides , a high imposing breastwork men of troy and pallas athena flung up for the man where he could race and escape that sea monster whenever it charged him hard from shore to plain
now the achaeans milled among the ship ways , shielded round by the looming superstructures , stern on stern drawn up on the first line inland
look — our finest champions laid up in the ships , all hit by arrows or run through by spears
her retinue fawning round her , phrygian ladies , slaves ?
save us from this ruthless day !
why do you battle so ?
so they clash , the trojan armies , armies of latins , foot dug in against foot , man packed against man
hypanis , dymas die as well , run through by their own men— and you , panthus , not all your piety , all the sacred bands you wore as apollo ’ s priest could save you as you fell
if only you would all been killed at the fast ships instead of my dear hector
so drive them yourself , your chariot and your team and let him charge — i will take him on with a sharp spear
his helmet flashed as hector nodded : yes , ajax , since god has given you power , build and sense and you are the strongest spearman of achaea , let us break off this dueling to the death , at least for today
you , dear earth , hold fast to that spear !
and while they prayed to the daughter of mighty zeus hector approached the halls of paris , sumptuous halls he built himself with the finest masons of the day , master builders famed in the fertile land of troy
and flanking them meriones came in haste with nestor 's handsome son — the kings had summoned both to share their counsel
so he warned as the trojans charged them , harder — and hector , lunging , leveled a pair of men who knew the joy of battle , riding a single chariot , menesthes and anchialus
or the two scipios , both thunderbolts of battle , libya ’ s scourge ?
he was overwhelmed by the latest salvos , driven back by the will of zeus and the fearless trojan spearmen hurling blows nonstop — a terrific din at his temples , his shining helmet clashing under repeated blows , relentless blows beating his forged cheek-irons
these are the spoils stripped from a proud king , our first fruits of battle , this is mezentius , the work of my right hand !
then men of phylace , pyrasus banked in flowers , demeter 's closed and holy grove and iton mother of flocks , antron along the shore and pteleos deep in meadows
so at their last parting the words came pouring deep from evander ’ s heart
do not lag behind , do not fling yourself at spoils just to haul the biggest portion back to your ship
in the same breath the god who shakes the mainland struck both men with his staff and filled their hearts with strength and striking force , put spring in their limbs , their feet and fighting hands
but the tin of the fire-new armor round his leg let loose an unearthly ring — back the spear sprang from the wondrous gear it struck , not punching through : the gift of the god hephaestus blocked its force
but now let us consent to the feasting that i loathe
i am eager to do it — whatever i can do
never again , i would say , will our gallant comrade risk his skin to attack the kings with insults
these he was just fitting , beating in the rivets
you are the one we would thought a worthy match for the whirling river xanthus !
their name till now is the name that shall endure
what an ominous war we wage , my countrymen !
euryalus seizes them , fits them onto his gallant shoulders all for nothing
my father 's the man who rules the hordes of myrmidons , peleus , son of aeacus , and aeacus sprang from zeus and as zeus is stronger than rivers surging out to sea , so the breed of zeus is stronger than any stream 's
do not tell me you rank our fathers with ourselves !
you , the sons of laomedon , as if to atone for the butchery of our cattle , our young bulls ?
the lapiths had just been rousing argives packed behind the rampart : close in a ring — defend the ships !
zeus who marshals the storm cloud loves you both , zeus 's daughter too with the shield of thunder
this is our last chance
like beroë now , iris mingles in among all the trojan mothers
and what a lovely haul , what plunder we rounded up and herded off the plain !
so packed around odysseus skilled and quick to maneuver swarmed the brave bulk of trojans — but still the hero kept on lunging , spearing , keeping death at bay
no one alive has ever escaped it , neither brave man nor coward , i tell you — it 's born with us the day that we are born
i had barely spoken when all at once , everything seemed to tremble , the gates of the god , apollo ’ s laurel-tree , the entire mountain around us seemed to quake , the tripod moaned , the sacred shrine swung open
closing , meges gave him some close attention too — the famous spearman struck behind his skull , just at the neck-cord , the razor spear slicing straight up through the jaws , cutting away the tongue — he sank in the dust , teeth clenching the cold bronze
our enemies swoop down on our country , full force !
so , couldn ’ t they die on the plains of troy ?
but never flinching , staunch diomedes countered , so brave with your bow and arrows — big bravado — glistening lovelocks , roving eye for girls !
our former champions , all laid up in the ships , all are hit by arrows or run through by spears
ah but tell me , hera , just what can you do about all this ?
king agamemnon , thrilled to watch them work , was quick to salute the chief and sing his praises : you are the one i prize , idomeneus , more than all our argive fighters fast with chariot-teams — whether in war or action of any sort or feasts where the ranking argive warlords mix their bowls with the shining wine of kings
that fellow who tried to fight the deathless gods
pay the danaans back — your arrows for my tears !
your trophies , nisus , now
leaning on this , the prince addressed his men : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies !
run for our lives or fling ourselves at his knees and beg for mercy !
and the whole assembly surged like big waves at sea , the icarian sea when east and south winds drive it on , blasting down in force from the clouds of father zeus , or when the west wind shakes the deep standing grain with hurricane gusts that flatten down the stalks — so the massed assembly of troops was shaken now
eurystheus , son of sthenelus , descended of perseus — so he is born of your own stock and immortal blood and it 's only right for him to rule the argives !
so you above all must speak your mind , and listen , and carry out the next man 's counsel too , whenever his spirit leads him on to speak for the public good
or throw some earth on my body—you know you can— sail back to velia ’ s port
so old nestor urged and the fighting spirit leapt inside patroclus — he dashed back by the ships toward achilles
she pinned them across her breasts with a golden brooch then sashed her waist with a waistband floating a hundred tassels , and into her earlobes , neatly pierced , she quickly looped her earrings , ripe mulberry-clusters dangling in triple drops and the silver glints they cast could catch the heart
so i believe and if i can read the future with any truth , i welcome him as ours
now you see before you xanthus and troy in replica , built with your own hands , under better stars , i trust , and less exposed to the greeks
but now commit our friends ’ unburied bodies to the earth , their only tribute down in the depths of hell
he ’ d given himself up , with one goal in mind : to open troy to the greeks and lay her waste
but across the lines aeneas called his comrades , glancing fast at deiphobus , paris , brave agenor , all the trojan captains who backed aeneas here , and fighters followed close behind like flocks that follow the lead ram , leaving the pastureland to drink at springs , and the shepherd 's heart exults
so grand , the temple of the gods where king latinus assumed his fathers ’ throne and summoned the trojans to him in the halls
— what is the mighty zeus 's daughter blazing after now ?
why , even now athena was speeding the fatal day when he would fall to the power of great achilles
this must be our message
sooner the racing dogs will eat him raw !
hecate held back nothing , put you in charge of avernus ’ groves
the blood of my comrades froze with instant dread
suddenly iulus shouted : what , we ’ re even eating our platters now ?
but i would like the leading captains to remain
but sarpedon 's loyal comrades laid him down , a man like a god beneath a fine spreading oak sacred to zeus whose shield is banked with clouds
that is your duty , a service that becomes you
so the right hand you want is clasping yours
or if there ’ s a way and your goddess mother makes it clear—for not without the will of the gods , i ’ m certain , do you strive to cross these awesome streams and stygian marsh— give me your pledge , your hand , in all my torment !
but the cave and giant palace of cacus lay exposed and his shadowy cavern cleaved wide to its depths— as if earth ’ s depths had yawned under some upheaval , bursting open the locks of the underworld ’ s abodes , revealing the livid kingdom loathed by the gods , and from high above you could see the plunging abyss and the ghosts terror-struck as the light comes streaming in
but may the gods , if there are powers who still respect the good and true , if justice still exists on the face of the earth , may they and their own sense of right and wrong bring you your just rewards
hippolochus ' brawny son was scrambling up the wall when teucer 's arrow winged him from high aloft , just where he saw his shoulder blade laid bare , and stopped his lust for battle
but it took twins — one with the reins rock-steady , holding them rock-steady , the other lashed the team
hungry as wolves that rend and bolt raw flesh , hearts filled with battle-frenzy that never dies — off on the cliffs , ripping apart some big antlered stag they gorge on the kill till all their jaws drip red with blood , then down in a pack they lope to a pooling , dark spring , their lean sharp tongues lapping the water 's surface , belching bloody meat , but the fury , never shaken , builds inside their chests though their glutted bellies burst — so wild the myrmidon captains , myrmidon field commanders swarming round achilles ' dauntless friend-in-arms
some gaze wonderstruck at the gift for pallas , the virgin never wed—transfixed by the horse , its looming mass , our doom
a deathless goddess — so she strikes our eyes !
nor will you , oebalus , go unsung in our songs
there harpalion charged menelaus — king pylaemenes ' son who would followed his father into war at troy but he never reached his fatherland again
turnus , the victor , commandeered the rest
now all these gifts will be handed you at once
— if now , in fact , the black cloud of the trojans blasts down on the ships with full gale force , our backs to the breaking surf but clinging still to a cramped strip of land — the argives , lost
and glaucus sensed it all and the man glowed with joy that the mighty god had heard his prayer so quickly
and so the promised day had arrived and the fates filled out the assigned time , when turnus ’ rampage warned the mother to drive his brands from her consecrated ships
then my father , mulling over our old traditions , answers : lords of troy , learn where your best hopes rest
it 's all for him , this merciless battle pitched before the ships
wind-quick iris curbed the team and loosing them from the chariot threw ambrosial fodder down before their hoofs
some put shoulders to giant grains and thrust them on , some dress the ranks , strictly marshal stragglers , and the whole trail seethes with labor
what do the dead souls want ?
troy is toppling from her heights
myself — a terrible longing drives me , heart and soul , down to the ships , into the vast achaean camp
apollo the archer stood beside him , taunting , hector , son of priam , why so far from your troops ?
not till i let loose my shout — then halt your withering fire !
well you know , old soldier loved by the gods , what sort of man he is — that great and terrible man
pull back at once , whenever you are thrown against him — or go down to the house of death against the will of fate
but the long-haired argive archers aimed at hector , trying to cut him down with arrows , hurling rocks till king agamemnon cried out in a ringing voice , hold back , argives !
he ’ d shouted some great boast , trusting his strength would match his words , probably lifting his spirits sky-high and promising gray hairs for himself and a ripe old age— as aeneas faced down tarquitus gloating in burnished gear and born to faunus , god of the woods , by the wood-nymph dryope
you are the only image of my astyanax that ’ s left
out in the lead , ascanius , still heading his horsemen , still in triumph , swerves for the ships at full tilt , his breathless handlers helpless to rein him back , and finding the camp in chaos , shouts out : madness , beyond belief !
lay down your swords !
that instant he launched an eagle — truest of zeus 's signs that fly the skies — a fawn clutched in its talons , sprung of a running doe , but he dropped it free beside the handsome shrine where achaean soldiers always sacrificed to zeus whose voice rings clear with omens
but in days to come do not let this quarrel breed some towering clash between us both , pitting you and me in conflict
but the lapiths still kept fighting , slaughtering on
we will let hector see if the spear in my hand is mad for bloodshed too !
aeneas , as rumor has it and posted scouts report , has recklessly sent his light horse on ahead to harass the plains , while he himself , crossing the mountain heights by a lonely , desolate ridge , he ’ s moving on the city
some are hung splayed out , exposed to the empty winds , some are plunged in the rushing floods—their stains , their crimes scoured off or scorched away by fire
— teucer 's arrow hitting the gleaming belt that cinched his body-shield around his chest — but zeus brushed from his son the deadly spirits : not by the ships ' high sterns would his sarpedon die
this is the realm of shadows , sleep and drowsy night
suddenly , surprising all , he tells the queen : here i am before you , the man you are looking for
and now , as her feet swept her toward olympus , ranks of achaeans , fleeing man-killing hector with grim , unearthly cries , reached the ships and the hellespont 's long shore
but now sarpedon , watching his comrades drop and die , war-shirts billowing free as patroclus killed them , dressed his godlike lycians down with a harsh shout : lycians , where 's your pride ?
nor do his children ride his knees with cries of 'father ' — home at last from the wars and heat of battle
three times she tried to struggle up on an elbow , three times she fell back , writhing on her bed
then , then you will glut the dogs and birds of troy with your fat and flesh — cut down by the beaked ships !
take your stand on the rampart here , before you orphan your son and make your wife a widow
the foam flecked his mouth and his eyes shot flame , glaring under his shaggy brows and round his head his helmet shook and clashed , a terrific wild din — hector on the attack !
at daybreak king agamemnon ordered parties of men and mules to haul in timber , pouring from the tents with a good man in charge , the lordly idomeneus ' aide-in-arms meriones
what , sleep all night ?
caught by the full band , undone by the dark , the place , the treachery , sudden crashing attack—he ’ s overwhelmed , they ’ re dragging him off , struggling , desperate , doomed
so now i am your host and friend in the heart of argos , you are mine in lycia when i visit in your country
what if i did protest , forbid you to raze their walls ?
orodes darts away but mezentius would not stoop to killing him on the run with a spearcast from behind , stabbing him , unseen , no , he dueled him man to man , proving himself the better man by force of arms , not stealth , and next , stamping his foot on the corpse and leaning hard on the spear , mezentius shouts out : here , men , lies no mean part of their battle strength , orodes , once so tall !
now what suffering , now he 's lost his father — astyanax !
seeing them all , he groaned—glaucus , medon , thersilochus , antenor ’ s three sons and the priest of ceres , polyboetes , idaeus too , still with chariot , still with gear in hand
when it comes to men , great ajax yields to no one , no mortal who eats demeter 's grain , i tell you , one you can break with bronze and volleyed rocks
here , mars , power of war , injects new heart and force in the latins , twisting his sharp spurs in their chests and loosing flight and dark fear at the trojan ranks , and the latins swarm in from all directions , seize the moment for all-out assault as the war-god strikes their spirits
you fabii , where do you rush me , all but spent ?
but hippolochus fathered me , i am proud to say
fight like men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
shouting he led the charge and his armies swarmed behind with blood-chilling cries
not even his fury will let him crash our gates — he will never plunder troy
very well then , let us give way to the dark night , set out our supper , unyoke our full-maned teams and pile the fodder down before their hoofs
aeneas marveled , his keen eyes gazing round , entranced by the site , gladly asking , learning , one by one , the legendary tales of the men of old
he dug his heel in the corpse , yanked his own bronze out but as for the dead man 's burnished gear — no hope
they ’ d hardly stood her image up in the greek camp when flickering fire shot from its glaring eyes and salt sweat ran glistening down its limbs and three times the goddess herself—a marvel— blazed forth from the ground , shield clashing , spear brandished
these woods i gladly gave the dardan prince when the prince lacked a fleet— now dread and anguish have me in their grip
can nothing hold you back ?
there — he killed astynous , then hypiron , a frontline captain
even so , it is less the pain of the trojans still to come that weighs me down , not even of hecuba herself or king priam , or the thought that my own brothers in all their numbers , all their gallant courage , may tumble in the dust , crushed by enemies — that is nothing , nothing beside your agony when some brazen argive hales you off in tears , wrenching away your day of light and freedom !
as she inflames their grief , idaeus and actor , ordered by ilioneus and iulus weeping freely , cradle her in their arms and bear her back inside
ashes of ilium , last flames that engulfed my world— i swear by you that in your last hour i never shrank from the greek spears , from any startling hazard of war— if fate had struck me down , my sword-arm earned it all
still , turnus takes his birth from our own breed , his name too— pilumnus was his forebear , four generations back— and his lavish hand has heaped your threshold high with treasure troves of gifts !
they placed the bones they found in a golden chest , shrouding them round and round in soft purple cloths
or his father ’ s familiar spirit ?
stand up to them — ring great ajax , telamon 's son
and old king priam was first to see him coming , surging over the plain , blazing like the star that rears at harvest , flaming up in its brilliance , — far outshining the countless stars in the night sky , that star they call orion 's dog — brightest of all but a fatal sign emblazoned on the heavens , it brings such killing fever down on wretched men
but now paris spotted him stripping apisaon , drew his bow at eurypylus , fast — he shot well and the arrow struck him full in the right thigh but the shaft snapped , the thigh weighed down with pain
and now his lovely mother impelled aeneas to storm the ramparts , hurl his troops at the city—fast , frontal assault— and panic the latins faced with swift collapse
so the bravest man in the broad realm of troy took her hand in marriage , true , the very man poseidon crushed at the hands of idomeneus here , spellbinding his shining eyes , crippling his fine legs
the glory goes to him if the argive fighters lay the trojans low and take their sacred city , but immense grief is his if comrades die in droves
and lead on priam too , priam in all his power , so the king himself can seal our truce in blood — his royal sons are reckless , not to be trusted : no one must trample on the oath we swear to zeus
but keep this message firmly in your mind
but caesar in triple triumph , borne home through the walls of rome , was paying eternal vows of thanks to the gods of italy : three hundred imposing shrines throughout the city
the king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears : never again , old man , let me catch sight of you by the hollow ships !
sweeter than honey from his tongue the voice flowed on and on
i am not condemned to wicked tartarus , those bleak shades , i live in elysium , the luminous fields where the true and faithful gather
he had them sit in a great and growing circle — now for funeral games — and brought from his ships the trophies for the contests : cauldrons and tripods , stallions , mules and cattle with massive heads , women sashed and lovely , and gleaming gray iron
there at the tip she bound the gorgeous golden yoke , she fastened the gorgeous golden breast straps next and under the yoke queen hera led the horses , racers blazing for war and the piercing shrieks of battle
so down you go
and cassandra saw him too
all this — i would extend to him if he will end his anger
all the treasures that filled his hollow ships and the prince hauled home to troy — would to god he would drowned before that day !
no breathing space , no letup , not a moment , not till the night comes on to part the fighters ' fury !
but she had a dream one night
and back he sprang in the car and told his driver to make for the hollow ships , racked with pain but he loosed a shrill cry to all his men : friends — lords of the argives , o my captains !
do you really believe that ’ s what the dust desires , the ghosts in their ashen tombs ?
here vulcan had forged the nomad race , the africans with their trailing robes , here the leleges , carians , gelonian archers bearing quivers , euphrates flowing now with a humbler tide , the morini brought from the world ’ s end , the two-horned rhine and the dahae never conquered , araxes river bridling at his bridge
down off the ship 's stern he dropped , his back slamming the ground , his limbs slack in death , and ajax shuddered , calling out to his brother , teucer , my friend — our trusted comrade 's dead , mastor 's son who came our way from cythera
so glaucus prayed and apollo heard his prayer
when the fatal horse mounted over our steep walls , its weighted belly teeming with infantry in arms— she led the phrygian women round the city , feigning the orgiastic rites of bacchus , dancing , shrieking but in their midst she shook her monstrous torch , a flare from the city heights , a signal to the greeks
but zeus who marshals storm clouds lowered a dark glance and let loose at ares : no more , you lying , two-faced
but good aeneas , consoling them all with heartfelt words , weeps as he commends them to acestes , their blood kin
but next agamemnon killed pisander and combat-hard hippolochus , two sons of antimachus , that cunning , politic man whom paris bribed with gold and sumptuous gifts , so he was the first to fight the return of helen to red-haired menelaus
don ’ t withdraw from my sight
where could he find some breathing room in battle ?
the god had still to attach the inlaid handles
his plan won hector over — less danger , more success — and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground , calling out to polydamas brisk , winged orders : you stay here , hold back our captains here
inspired by treachery now or the fate of troy was moving toward this end
no light work for the teams that trundled chariots churning massive wheels to make it through in stride but the trojans strained to bring it off on foot
shadowy mountain ranges , seas that surge and thunder
there he made the earth and there the sky and the sea and the inexhaustible blazing sun and the moon rounding full and there the constellations , all that crown the heavens , the pleiades and the hyades , orion in all his power too and the great bear that mankind also calls the wagon : she wheels on her axis always fixed , watching the hunter , and she alone is denied a plunge in the ocean 's baths
this is no foot-race
the son of cronus , zeus , throned aloft in the heavens where he lives , zeus himself will brandish over their heads his black storm-shield , enraged at their deceit
over the brush , the quickest route , cross-country , armored fighters ride
i think , in fact , the favor of all the gods and juno ’ s backing drove these trojan ships on the winds that sailed them here
for the rest who followed , waking achaea 's war-lust , what man has spirit strong enough to sing their names ?
the cries are fiercer — fighters beside the ships !
let someone commit my body to the earth , snatched from battle or ransomed back for gold
look , zeus just drove the rest of my comrades off in panic flight
gone— and at last the night was over
whirling , killing coeranus , chromius and alastor , killing alcander and halius , prytanis and noemon — and stalwart odysseus would have killed still more but tall hector , his helmet flashing , marked him quickly , plowed through the front , helmed in fiery bronze , filling the argives ' hearts with sudden terror
so it must please his overweening heart , who knows ?
and she called her well-kempt women through the house to set a large three-legged cauldron over the fire so hector could have his steaming hot bath when he came home from battle — poor woman , she never dreamed how far he was from bathing , struck down at achilles ' hands by blazing-eyed athena
the rest of my brothers perished in that rout
think of a cloudburst bearing down with gusts of hail and every plowman , every farmhand quits the fields and the traveler keeps safe in a welcome refuge under some river ’ s banks or cavern ’ s rocky arch while rain pelts the earth , so when the sun returns they can all get on with the day ’ s work
we have cities too , in the land of sicily , arms and a king , acestes , born of trojan blood
deadly going , fighting now for all they were worth , staking all on their own strength and friends overhead as they ripped off rocks from the rampart 's sturdy ledge and hurled them down , defending themselves , their shelters , their fast ships — the rocks pelted the ground like snow that a sudden squall in fury , driving the dark clouds , heaps thick-and-fast on the earth that feeds us all
that man must be a king !
for the men of troy the day went down against their will but not the argives — what a blessing , how they prayed for the nightfall coming on across their lines
and now they might have won their journey home , the men of argos fighting the will of fate , yes , if hera had not alerted athena : inconceivable !
wild as a swollen river hurling down on the flats , down from the hills in winter spate , bursting its banks with rain from storming zeus , and stands of good dry oak , whole forests of pine it whorls into itself and sweeps along till it heaves a crashing mass of driftwood out to sea — so glorious ajax swept the field , routing trojans , shattering teams and spearmen in his onslaught
exchange shields with the greeks and wear their emblems
the glory of armor lit the skies and the whole earth laughed , rippling under the glitter of bronze , thunder resounding under trampling feet of armies
when you fight a man against the will of the gods , a man they have sworn to honor — then look out , a heavy wave of ruin 's about to overwhelm you
in his son 's command sailed forty long black ships
wasting blow after blow at each other , thrown but missed then blow , blow upon hollow ribs , landing fast and furious , pounding chestbones , flurry of blows to head and ears , jaws cracking under the crush of hammering jabs— massive entellus , stock-still in his tracks , merely rolls to avoid the salvos , eyes fixed on his rival
but the shining archer pandarus marked him storming down the plain , smashing the trojan lines before him
what land could please me more , and where would i rather beach our battered ships than sicily ?
spurring them on to raise their spears for full assault and the trojans ' fury massed and mounted , war cries broke but apollo suddenly stood by hector , shouting , do not for a moment duel achilles , hector , out in front of your ranks !
gathered round her sat the other immortal sea-nymphs while thetis amidst them mourned her brave son 's fate , doomed to die , she knew , on the fertile soil of troy , far from his native land
a son , as greeks will tell , of electra , that electra , daughter of atlas , mighty atlas who bears the grand orb of the heavens on his shoulders
meanwhile odysseus drew in close to chryse island , bearing the splendid sacrifice in the vessel 's hold
you will drive me into war with hera
then giant ajax and tactful royal odysseus
it ’ s right to break my sworn oath to the greeks , it ’ s right to detest those men and bring to light all they ’ re hiding now
her fury inflamed by all this , the daughter of saturn drove over endless oceans trojans left by the greeks and brute achilles
with that he whirled her round in his massive hand and flung her out of the brilliant , starry skies and she soon found herself in the world of men
what , shall we head for the sea— or troy ?
equipped with this , he spurs the winds and swims through billowing clouds till in mid-flight he spies the summit and rugged flanks of atlas , whose long-enduring peak supports the skies
there , pronous first to fall — a glint of the spear and patroclus tore his chest left bare by the shield-rim , loosed his knees and the man went crashing down
but phoebus apollo plucked him up in his hands and swathed him round in a swirling dark mist for fear some argive fast with chariot-team might hurl bronze in his chest and rip his life out
and when the victims ’ chests are splayed , dido , her lips parted , pores over their entrails , throbbing still , for signs
three calves to eryx , then a ewe to the god of storms— he orders killed , and the crewmen slip the cables , one after another
echeclus son of agenor next — achilles split his head at the brow with hilted sword so the whole blade ran hot with blood , and red death came plunging down his eyes , and the strong force of fate
with blood you must seek fair winds to sail you home , must sacrifice one more greek life in return
now home he 's gone to the dear land of his fathers , his warships empty , leaving behind the hero menelaus moldering in his wake !
no , do not give up now
but the two of you will never quit this fight , i would say , till one of you drops and dies and gluts with blood ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield !
then how could i pass up royal odysseus here ?
others disgrace themselves , so panicked they clamber back inside the monstrous horse , burying into the womb they know so well
aeneas suddenly glances back and beneath a cliff to the left he sees an enormous fortress ringed with triple walls and raging around it all , a blazing flood of lava , tartarus ’ river of fire , whirling thunderous boulders
i chafe to face my man , full force , though there 's not a scrap of mine for looting here , no cattle or gold the foe could carry off
chiefs of the argives armed in bronze , no orders for you — it 's wrong to incite you two , you lead your men to war in so much force
one declaimed in public , vowing payment in full — the other spurned him , he would not take a thing — so both men pressed for a judge to cut the knot
we — your allies here — we do your fighting for you
but go no further
do not harbor it deep inside you
the fourth battalion marched with gallant aeneas , anchises ' offspring flanked by antenor 's two sons , acamas and archelochus drilled for every foray
this time , true , menelaus has won the day , thanks to athena
but your own handsome war-gear lies in trojan hands , bronze and burnished — and hector in that flashing helmet , hector glories in your armor , strapped across his back
try to refrain from cheating your superiors
then over her brows athena placed her golden helmet fronted with four knobs and forked with twin horns , engraved with the fighting men of a hundred towns
never once did you arm with the troops and go to battle or risk an ambush packed with achaea 's picked men — you lack the courage , you can see death coming
you see for yourself , i know , how father zeus sends waves of ruin breaking down our lines — victory goes to troy
tydides hurled next , the bronze launched from his hand and not for nothing : hitting phegeus ' chest between the nipples it pitched him out behind his team
but of course—so turnus can fetch his royal bride— our lives are cheap , scattered in piles across the field , unburied and unwept
it 's all for him i have come to the ships now , to win him back from you — i bring a priceless ransom
i will never force the man to go
across the earth all other creatures were stretched out in sleep , easing their cares , their spirits blank to hardship
but when hecate put me in charge of avernus ’ groves she taught me all the punishments of the gods , she led me through them all
be at peace for now
so much for his plan
at that , hector spun and rushed from his house , back by the same way down the wide , well-paved streets throughout the city until he reached the scaean gates , the last point he would pass to gain the field of battle
all on attack— the armies wheeling around for combat , all the latins , all the trojans—mnestheus , fierce serestus , messapus breaker of horses , brawny asilas— the etruscan squadron , evander ’ s arcadian wings , each fighter at peak strength , all force put to the test as they soldier on , no rest , no letup—total war
come — lead off , if you can , with all your fighting power !
with that oath he raised his scepter high in the eyes of all the gods and idaeus turned , trailing back to sacred troy
and achilles ' only weapon patroclus did not take was the great man 's spear , weighted , heavy , tough
nothing for you to fear , no punishment to come
at that his brother dropped his bow in a shelter , slung a shield on his shoulder , four plies thick , over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror
their ships were drawn up far away from the fighting , moored in a group along the gray churning surf — first ships ashore they would hauled up on the plain then built a defense to landward off their sterns
no other achaean could have brought me round so soon , but seeing that you have suffered much and labored long , your noble father , your brother too — all for my sake — i will yield to your appeal , i will even give you the mare , though she is mine , so our people here will know the heart inside me is never rigid , unrelenting
at the heart of the house an ample altar stood , naked under the skies , an ancient laurel bending over the shrine , embracing our household gods within its shade
nor did pallas muster a slow , unwilling army there in pylos , all of us spoiling for a fight
sealing his pledge by the styx , his brother ’ s stream , by the banks that churn with pitch-black rapids , whirlpools swirling dark , he nodded his assent and his nod made all of mount olympus quake
to die , tell me , is that the worst we face ?
ares had to endure it , when giant ephialtes and otus , sons of aloeus , bound him in chains he could not burst , trussed him up in a brazen cauldron , thirteen months
nothing achieved by all our gifts , our gold , our fervent appeals
quickly — let each fighter sharpen his spear well , balance his shield well , feed his horses well with plenty of grain to build their racing speed — each man look well to his chariot 's running order , nerve himself for combat now , so all day long we can last out the grueling duels of ares !
you never give up the good fight , do you ?
some forces at some ships , some clashing at others , but hector charged head-on at ajax braced for battle and both warriors fought it out for a single vessel , nor could hector burst through and ignite the hull nor ajax drive him back — a god drove hector on
he dons messapus ’ helmet crested with tossing plumes
this order still on his lips , the god vanished from sight into empty air
and the one who proves the better man and wins , he will take those treasures fairly , lead the woman home
no doubt venus fears that treacherous house and the tyrians ’ forked tongues , and brutal juno inflames her anguish too and her cares keep coming back as night draws on
chromis led the mysian men with ennomus seer of birds — but none of his winged signs could beat off black death
for if your hands should violate this great offering to minerva , a total disaster—if only god would turn it against the seer himself ! —will wheel down on priam ’ s empire , troy , and all your futures
there on the spot his strength and life collapsed and blinding grief for the driver overpowered hector , stunned for his friend but he left him lying there and cried out to his brother cebriones close by , take the reins !
oh , italy , oh , what a rugged bastion you have lost , how great your loss , my iulus !
so this , this is the doom that strong fate spun out , our son 's life line drawn with his first breath — the moment i gave him birth — to glut the wild dogs , cut off from his parents , crushed by the stronger man
and round about they slaughter droves of cattle , carcasses offered up to death , and bristling swine and beasts led in from the fields are butchered over the flames
those two will flinch , they would never dare stand up to us man-to-man in all-out battle !
i will see to this
they are fighting over his corpse
but let achilles remain here , for the moment , much as his heart would race him into war
i dreamed i addressed him first , in tears myself i forced my voice from the depths of all my grief : oh light of the trojans—last , best hope of troy !
exhausted , we land at actium , trek to the little town
sound tactics — the captains hung on his words and all fell in line
here the clear commands of apollo call him back as the god impels us toward the tuscan tiber , the numicus ’ sacred springs
there strife took her stand , raising her high-pitched cry , great and terrible , lashing the fighting-fury in each achaean 's heart — no stopping them now , mad for war and struggle
i say have done with the man — whether he sails for home or stays on here
my legs no longer firm , my friend , dead on my feet , nor do my arms go shooting from my shoulders — the stunning punch , the left and right are gone
but she , her eyes fixed on the ground , turned away , her features no more moved by his pleas as he talked on than if she were set in stony flint or parian marble rock
the weapons you see are honed for our foes , the latins
holding her in his arms , he made for the ridges , wild , dense with woods , with enemy weapons raining down around them , volscian forces closing for the kill
his keen rutulians spur each other to arms , some moved by his matchless build and youth , some by his royal bloodline , some by his sword-arm ’ s shining work in war
but the lawful wife of menelaus , renowned menelaus , he will not give her up , paris makes that clear , though all troy commands him to do precisely that
and then , finally , meleager 's bride , beautiful cleopatra begged him , streaming tears , recounting all the griefs that fall to people whose city 's seized and plundered — the men slaughtered , citadel burned to rubble , enemies dragging the children , raping the sashed and lovely women
the father of men and gods , smiling down on her with the glance that clears the sky and calms the tempest , lightly kissing his daughter on the lips , replied : relieve yourself of fear , my lady of cythera , the fate of your children stands unchanged , i swear
not a ship in sight
there , you see that youth who leans on a tipless spear of honor ?
once they had borne him into the famous halls , they laid his body down on his large carved bed and set beside him singers to lead off the laments , and their voices rose in grief — they lifted the dirge high as the women wailed in answer
but that girl — you never block her way with a word or action , never , you spur her on , since you , you gave her birth from your own head , that child of devastation !
as for patroclus , there seemed no hope that achaeans could drag the corpse of achilles ' comrade out of range
things are bad , but that would be the best
you see the rutulians on the rampage ?
now down we go , united — review them as we pass
patroclus ordered automedon to yoke them quickly — a man he honored next to achilles breaker of men , always firmest in battle , nerved to wait the call
what of your sacred word ?
oh would to god you would died there , brought down by that great soldier , my husband long ago
you—what i won ’ t do !
your wish will be my command , trojan , i embrace your gifts
behold hector now — if you ever once rejoiced to see him striding home , home alive from battle !
hard by the camp it lay tied up , riding at anchor , shielded round by the high redoubts and river currents— here he attacks , shouting out to his cheering comrades : bring up fire !
men building their homes already , trusting the land already , their fleet abandoned now
as soon as they saw the tall ships gliding through the shadowed woods and the rowers bending to pull the oars in silence— alarmed by the unexpected sight , all rise as one to desert the sacred feast
even before now they would shake to see him coming
i bowed my head in assent that day the goddess thetis clutched my knees , begging me to exalt achilles scourge of cities
and with that he breathed fresh fire in the team
he pleaded with both kings , with clear good will , no more — or enormous sorrow comes to all achaea !
all or nothing now — die , or live and drive defeat from the ships !
camilla , keen to fix some trojan arms on a temple wall or sport some golden plunder out on the hunt , she tracked him now , one man in the moil of war , she stalked him wildly , reckless through the ranks , afire with a woman ’ s lust for loot and plunder when , grasping his chance at last , rising up from ambush arruns flings his spear with a winged prayer aloft : apollo , highest of gods , lord of holy soracte !
it 's found its home in an argive 's waiting flesh — a crutch in his grip , i would say , as he trudges down now to the house of death !
i set sail for italy— all against my will
and now they all come looming up before me , terrible shapes , the deadly foes of troy , the gods gigantic in power
not if you ventured down as far as the black abyss itself — i care nothing for you , you and your snarling anger , none in the world a meaner bitch than you
his wife went with him
beg the numidians , grovel , plead for a husband— though time and again i scorned to wed their like ?
don ’ t resist our welcome
you think that you , unburied , can lay your eyes on the styx ’ s flood , the furies ’ ruthless stream , and approach the banks unsummoned ?
on our backs , from the day that we were born , it seems that zeus has piled his pack of hardships
and next they killed pylaemenes tough as ares , a captain heading the paphlagonian shieldsmen , hot-blooded men
that splendid shield he gripped before his chest and shaking a pair of spears went stalking out like a mountain lion starved for meat too long and the lordly heart inside him fires him up to raid some stormproof fold , to go at the sheep , and even if he should light on herdsmen at the spot , guarding their flocks with dogs and bristling spears , the marauder has no mind to be driven off that steading , not without an attack
what shall i do ?
so , with a warm heart celebrate them with us now
and on their side the trojans put on harness too , mustering throughout the city , a smaller force but nerved to engage in combat even so — necessity pressed them to fight for sons and wives
and he will add a dowry , yes , a magnificent treasure the likes of which no man has ever offered with his daughter
mercury made ready at once to obey the great commands of his almighty father
my strength is too far gone for feats of arms
he told me to go through the rushing dark night , to patrol the enemy lines and learn at once if the fleet 's still guarded as before or now , battered down at our hands , huddling together , you plan a quick escape , your morale too low to mount the watch tonight — bone-weary from battle
i know for a fact the spirit in your heart is well-disposed to me and all my efforts
and the matchless runner reassured him : courage !
and many a fish , leaping up through the waves , breaking the cold ripples shivering dark will dart and bolt lycaon 's glistening fat !
i ’ ll sweep it all away , the mist so murky , dark , and swirling around you now , it clouds your vision , dulls your mortal sight
and there helen sat , helen the child of zeus whose shield is storm and lightning , glancing away , lashing out at her husband : so , home from the wars !
there was an ancient city held by tyrian settlers , carthage , facing italy and the tiber river ’ s mouth but far away—a rich city trained and fierce in war
he recalls at once the two lines of our race , two parents : his own error , his late mistake about ancient places
handmaids ran to attend their master , all cast in gold but a match for living , breathing girls
death is your last worry
devouring fire whipped by the winds goes churning into the rooftops , flames surging over them , scorching blasts raging up the sky
the goddess answered quickly , her eyes blazing , true , dear brother — how your father and mother both implored me , time and again , clutching my knees , and the comrades round me begging me to stay !
spirits lifting at dido ’ s welcome , brave achates and captain aeneas had long chafed to break free of the mist , and now achates spurs aeneas on : son of venus , what feelings are rising in you now ?
there they sat in assembly , trojans , dardans , all collected together , waiting long and tense for the herald to return
turn prows to land !
and iris racing the wind went veering off
father anchises crowned a great bowl with wreaths , brimmed it with unmixed wine , and standing tall in the stern , he prayed the gods : you powers that rule the land and sea and storms , grant us wind for an easy passage , blow us safe to port !
quick as a black swift darts along through the great halls of a wealthy lord , and scavenging morsels , banquet scraps for her chirping nestlings , all her twitterings echo now in the empty colonnades , now round the brimming ponds
the first to hurl , great ajax hit the ridge of the helmet 's horsehair crest — the bronze point stuck in acamas ' forehead pounding through the skull and the dark came swirling down to shroud his eyes
picture a shepherd tracking bees to their rocky den , closed up in the clefts he fills with scorching smoke and all inside , alarmed by the danger , swarming round through their stronghold walled with wax , hone sharp their rage to a piercing buzz and the black reek goes churning through their house and the rocks hum with a blind din and the smoke spews out into thin air
down he sat , flanking cronus ' son , gargantuan in the glory of it all , and the blessed gods were struck with terror then , they stopped shackling zeus
now aloft by the side of zeus the gods sat in council , conferring across olympus ' golden floor as noble hebe poured them rounds of nectar
over it no bird on earth could make its way unscathed , such poisonous vapors steamed up from its dark throat to cloud the arching sky
away with you , madman — damn you !
now with the squadrons marshaled , captains leading each , the trojans came with cries and the din of war like wildfowl when the long hoarse cries of cranes sweep on against the sky and the great formations flee from winter 's grim ungodly storms , flying in force , shrieking south to the ocean gulfs , speeding blood and death to the pygmy warriors , launching at daybreak savage battle down upon their heads
just think what he would do at sea where the fish swarm — why , the man could glut a fleet , diving for oysters !
i have never seen such men , i never will again
eurypylus staggered back to his massing comrades , dodging death , and shouted a stark piercing cry : friends — lords of the argives , all our captains !
and the bellows , all twenty , blew on the crucibles , breathing with all degrees of shooting , fiery heat as the god hurried on — a blast for the heavy work , a quick breath for the light , all precisely gauged to the god of fire 's wish and the pace of the work in hand
so iris , glistening dew , comes skimming down from the sky on gilded wings , trailing showers of iridescence shimmering into the sun , and hovering over dido ’ s head , declares : so commanded , i take this lock as a sacred gift to the god of death , and i release you from your body
agamemnon had a vessel hauled down to the sea , he picked out twenty oarsmen to man her locks , put aboard the cattle for sacrifice to the god and led chryseis in all her beauty amidships
bring two lambs — a white male and a black ewe for the sun and earth — and we will bring a third for zeus
where could i turn ?
brothers-in-arms , he and medon led the phthians , out in the forefront of those gallant soldiers fighting beside boeotians now to save the ships
how wrong we were when we said you had good sense
for i can ’ t believe , my brave one , you could bend to a stranger ’ s orders , bear a trojan master
up with the war cries , all together !
enemy at the gates now , while off in the distance much was under way , saturnian juno hurried iris down from the sky to turnus brash in arms , seated then by chance in a hallowed glen , his forebear pilumnus ’ grove
and still we engage him , trying to block his way with a word or show of force
cluster round patroclus , shoulder-to-shoulder , fight them at close range !
come under our roofs—our welcome guest
why , you can scheme to your heart 's content without a qualm in the world for me
but first go down to the house of death , the underworld , go through avernus ’ depths , my son , to seek me , meet me there
that duel , that deadly pact—i can not bear to watch
but a god goes with him always , beating off disaster — look , that 's ares beside him now , just like a mortal !
he placed it in his hands , and he was glad to have it
no doubt some mortal has suffered a dearer loss than this , a brother born in the same womb , or even a son
all wiped from your mind , all thought of food and bed ?
look at the vast achaean armies you command !
antilochus was the first to kill a trojan captain , tough on the front lines , thalysias ' son echepolus
why have you come ?
tense as a chalk-line marks the cut of a ship timber , drawn taut and true in a skilled shipwright 's hands — some master craftsman trained in athena 's school — so tense the battle line was drawn , dead even
shorten sail , change course
then the shouts break loose , and the banks and rapids round resound with the din , and the high sky thunders back
triple-plumed , his high helmet raises up a chimaera with all the fires of etna blasting from its throat and roaring all the more , its searing flames more deadly the more blood flows and the battle grows more fierce
and swelling his ranks , three hundred , all as one alert to obey his orders , men whose home is caere , men from minio ’ s fields , from ancient pyrgi and fever-racked graviscae
now , at last , let us turn our thoughts to supper
who could rightly call me beaten—you , you swine— who bothers to see the tiber crest with trojan blood and evander ’ s house uprooted , razed to the earth and all his arcadian fighters stripped of arms ?
that arruns should cut camilla down in sudden death : that he granted , true , but not that his noble land should see him home again and the gusting southwinds swept that prayer away
spotting them now the lord of men agamemnon dressed them down with a winging burst of scorn : you there , peteos ' son , a king , dear to the gods !
let any rugged fighter who shoulders a small buckler pass it on to a weaker man — put on the bigger shield
all you gods , you shared in the wedding rites , and so did you , apollo — there you sat at the feast and struck your lyre
laid low by a wound aimed for another , luckless man , he looks up at the heavens , longing for his dear argos as he dies
the swift runner replied in haste , so be it
only the god of death is so relentless , death submits to no one — so mortals hate him most of all the gods
i will do it all
and reaching odysseus first , a mastermind like zeus , the old driver roused him from sleep , shouting out , wake up !
staring grimly , the proud runner achilles answered , beg no more , you fawning dog — begging me by my parents !
antheus and mnestheus flank him closely , dashing on and from the deserted camp roll all their swarming ranks
their captain gone , camilla ’ s light horse squadrons are first to flee , the harried rutulians flee and brave atinas too , leaders routed , and front-line men , their leaders lost , make for safety , swerving their horses , racing for the walls
how could such an outrage slip from a father ’ s lips ?
but one heifer , deep in the vast cavern , lowed back and cacus ’ prisoner foiled its jailer ’ s hopes
a beloved , honored friend — but it 's been so long , your visits much too rare
once ashore , when you reach the city of cumae and avernus ’ haunted lakes and murmuring forests , there you will see the prophetess in her frenzy , chanting deep in her rocky cavern , charting the fates , committing her vision to words , to signs on leaves
look how you cringe in the face of menelaus , no great fighter before this — a weakling , soft
let him have no fear of death , no dread in his heart , such a powerful escort we will send him — the giant-killer hermes will guide him all the way to achilles ' presence
sons huddled round their father deep in the courtyard , robes drenched with tears , and the old man amidst them , buried , beaten down in the cloak that wrapped his body
so when he sent his javelin hissing through the air and all the volscians , wheeling , trained their eyes and alert minds on the princess , she was numb to it all , the draft , the hiss , the weapon sent from the blue—until the spear went ripping through her , under her naked breast and it struck deep , it hammered home and drank her virgin blood
a huge throng of the dead came streaming toward the banks : mothers and grown men and ghosts of great-souled heroes , their bodies stripped of life , and boys and unwed girls and sons laid on the pyre before their parents ’ eyes
please bear with me , hear me out
but immortal athena , her gray eyes wide , protested strongly : father !
so by the ships the other lords of achaea 's armies slept all night long , overcome by gentle sleep
what a far cry from the old hector home from battle , decked in achilles ’ arms—his trophies— or fresh from pitching trojan fire at the greek ships
if the fates had left me free to live my life , to arrange my own affairs of my own free will , troy is the city , first of all , that i ’ d safeguard , troy and all that ’ s left of my people whom i cherish
and here came caletor son of trojan clytius sweeping fire against the prow but famous ajax stopped him short with a spear that stabbed his chest
he cries and hurls his javelin into the sky— the opening shot of war—and high in his saddle races down the plain as his shouting comrades speed him on , riding in his wake with their war cries striking terror , amazed at the trojans ’ bloodless hearts , and calling : no trusting themselves to a level field of battle !
no , of all the cities under the sun and starry skies , wherever men who walk the earth have dwelled , i honor sacred ilium most with my immortal heart : priam and men of priam who hurls the strong ash spear
a great engine of battle ?
he slid from under the altar , glided up the tree and there the brood of a sparrow , helpless young ones , teetered high on the topmost branch-tips , cowering under the leaves there , eight they were all told and the mother made the ninth , she would borne them all — chirping to break the heart but the snake gulped them down and the mother cried out for her babies , fluttering over him
another contingent guard the gates and man the towers
he roars like blazing brush piled under the ribs of a billowing bronze cauldron— the water seethes in the heat and a river boils inside it , bubbling up in spume—the bowl can ’ t hold it , it overflows and a thick cloud of steam goes shooting into the air
this crag jutting over the ridge , leaning left of the river down below— he charged from the right and rocked it , prised it up from its bedrock , tore it free of its roots , then abruptly hurled it down and the hurl ’ s force made mighty heaven roar as the banks split far apart and the river ’ s tide went flooding back in terror
and all because of italy
but the giant ajax answered briskly , wait , idaeus , tell hector here to call the truce
fighting words , and diomedes was torn two ways — he would half a mind to turn the team and take him face-to-face
august , immense , its hundred columns soaring , the house commanded the city heights , laurentine picus ’ home with its shuddering grove and ancestral , awesome aura
from then on , ulysses kept tormenting me , pressing charge on charge ; from then on , he bruited about his two-edged rumors among the rank and file
as they closed on each other , both in range , the matchless runner achilles opened up : aeneas — why so far from your own ranks , standing all exposed ?
the son of atreus smoldered , glaring across at him , but nestor rose between them , the man of winning words , the clear speaker of pylos
and so , luring the headlong ares off the lines athena sat him down on scamander 's soft , sandy banks while argives bent the trojans back
his woolly sheep at his side , his sole pleasure , his only solace in pain
three times he tried to wrench it free , tugging madly , thrice gave up the struggle — the fourth with all his might he fought to bend aeacides ' shaft and break it off but before it budged the hero was all over him , slashing out his life , slitting his belly open — a scooping slice at the navel and all his bowels spilled out on the ground , darkness swirled his eyes as he gasped his breath away
next the grave aeneas flings a spear at mezentius— right through the buckler ’ s three round plates of bronze , through the linen plies and bull ’ s-hide triply stitched the spear pierced , plunging deep in the man ’ s groin but its force stopped short of home
a total rout — and white-armed hera saw it , and filled with pity the goddess ' words went winging toward athena : look , daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder — do not we care for them any longer ?
zeus made you a lion against all women , true , he lets you kill off mothers in their labor — but you will find it painful , matching force with me
how could any argive soldier obey your orders , freely and gladly do your sailing for you or fight your enemies , full force ?
stop , my glorious blazing boy !
this brusque command dispersed the muster quickly
she gave her servants orders and out they strode to gather the older noble women through the city
the flame keeps gnawing into her tender marrow hour by hour and deep in her heart the silent wound lives on
nothing could match its beauty — a masterpiece that skilled sidonian craftsmen wrought to perfection , phoenician traders shipped across the misty seas and mooring in thoas ' roads , presented to the king
if you no longer harbor any hope for our armies , if we are so alone , and at one repulse our forces are totally overwhelmed , good fortunes lost forever , let us reach out our helpless arms and plead for peace
latium ’ s sons will retain their fathers ’ words and ways
three ships the southwind grips and spins against those boulders lurking in mid-ocean— rocks the italians call the altars , one great spine breaking the surface—three the eastwind sweeps from open sea on the syrtes ’ reefs , a grim sight , girding them round with walls of sand
yes , but as soon as fiery-eyed athena marked them killing argive ranks in this all-out assault , down she rushed from the peaks of mount olympus straight for sacred troy
nothing — unless we do exactly as i say
i ’ ve seen him gnawing limbs , oozing dark filth , and the warm flesh twitching still between his grinding jaws
look , trailing those very manes along the ground
then , atrides , lead the way — you are the greatest king — spread out a feast for all your senior chiefs
shield your sister 's husband — if grief can touch your heart
better for me this way , poseidon too , to yield before my mighty hands — outraged as he is : not without sweat would we have called it quits
make yourself—you too—worthy to be a god
there they stood , pleading to be the first ones ferried over , reaching out their hands in longing toward the farther shore
now he ’ s dealing death to sthenelus , thamyris , pholus : sthenelus speared at long-range , the next two hand-to-hand , at a distance too both sons of imbrasus , glaucus and lades
but asius leapt down to defend his comrade , just ahead of his chariot-horses still held close by a driver , the team snorting , panting over his shoulders — asius strained in fury to spear idomeneus but the cretan took him first
as they reached the trench and rampart round the fleet , the sentries had just begun to set out supper there but the giant-killer plunged them all in sleep
have done at last
so we have heard in the famous deeds of fighting men , of heroes , when seething anger would overcome the great ones
first find lycia 's captains , range the ranks , spur them to fight and shield sarpedon 's body
by now the huntress had reached olympus heights and made her way to the bronze-floored house of zeus
no , not if i had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths and a voice of iron too—i could never capture all the crimes or run through all the torments , doom by doom
however the future years will exalt his actions : a patriot ’ s love wins out , and boundless lust for praise
and out before them all , two men took battle-stations , patroclus and automedon , seized with a single fury to fight in the comrades ' vanguard , far in front
and there in the bedroom hector came on paris polishing , fondling his splendid battle-gear , his shield and breastplate , turning over and over his long curved bow
and the sands grew wet , the armor of fighting men grew wet with tears , such bitter longing he roused
then they scattered , each to his own ship and shelter
the ruthless rock striking the bones and tendons crushed them to pulp — he landed flat on his back , slamming the dust , both arms flung out to his comrades , gasping out his life
and all day long they appeased the god with song , raising a ringing hymn to the distant archer god who drives away the plague , those young achaean warriors singing out his power , and apollo listened , his great heart warm with joy
next the veteran leonteus gave the weight a hurl , then ajax came up third and the giant flung it hard with his rippling brawny arm to pass all other marks
you think it nothing , the pain that zeus has sent me ?
now then , there 's a frontier fortress , thryoessa perched on cliffs , far off above the alpheus , at the edge of sandy pylos
you ’ ve seen the stallion turnus rides , the armor he sports , all gold—that mount , the shield , the blood-red plumes , i exempt from the lot
the argive trench could not hold out much longer , nor could the rampart rearing overhead , the wide wall they raised to defend the ships and the broad trench they drove around it all — they never gave the gods the splendid sacrifice the immortals craved , that the fortress might protect the fast ships and the bulking plunder heaped behind its shield
whatever can be done
back you will slink to our fast ships tomorrow , playing the spy again or fighting face-to-face
at his command they harnessed oxen and mules to wagons , they assembled before the city walls with all good speed and for nine days hauled in a boundless store of timber
and then , after we have eased our hearts with tears and dirge , we free the teams and all take supper here
two generations of mortal men he had seen go down by now , those who were born and bred with him in the old days , in pylos ' holy realm , and now he ruled the third
treating me like some vagabond , some outcast stripped of all my rights
and shattered with anger , the old man withdrew but apollo heard his prayer — he loved him , deeply — he loosed his shaft at the argives , withering plague , and now the troops began to drop and die in droves , the arrows of god went showering left and right , whipping through the achaeans ' vast encampment
and you , great son of atreus
his filth appalling , his beard all tangled , his rags hooked up with thorns
why so slow , trojan aeneas ?
the other 's aeneas , claims anchises ' blood , the noble anchises , but his mother 's aphrodite
i will tell it all
what is the crime if we seek far-off kingdoms too ?
the goddess fouled my finish !
hector lunged at ajax toe-to-toe , hacked his ash-wood pike with a heavy sword and striking the socket just behind the point he slashed the head clean off , leaving the shaft , the lopped stump dangling in ajax ' fist , useless , bronze head bounding away , clanging along the ground
watch , exulting here in the thick of carnage , an amazon , one breast bared for combat , quiver at hand—camilla—now she rifles hardened spears from her hand in salvos , now she seizes a rugged double axe in her tireless grasp , diana ’ s golden archery clashing on her shoulder
and here , close to the springs , lie washing-pools scooped out in the hollow rocks and broad and smooth where the wives of troy and all their lovely daughters would wash their glistening robes in the old days , the days of peace before the sons of achaea came
but aeneas , bound to his oath , his head exposed and the hand unarmed he was stretching toward his comrades , shouted out : where are you running ?
iphidamas , the rough and rangy son of antenor bred in the fertile land of thrace , mother of flocks
just call father back , bring him back to my eyes
— all those troubles we suffered here alongside troy , we alone of the gods when zeus dispatched us down to slave for proud laomedon one whole year , for stated wages — at that man 's beck and call
the curetes were fighting the combat-hard aetolians , armies ringing calydon , slaughtering each other , aetolians defending their city 's handsome walls and curetes primed to lay them waste in battle
you take on the etruscan cavalry—frontal assault , flanked by brave messapus , the latin horsemen and squadrons of tiburtus
and so both sides had clashed in the cruel thick-and-fast of war while aeneas plowed the sea in the dead of night
the guide and giant-killer answered quickly , you are right , old man , all straight to the mark
and olympian zeus the lord of lightning went to his own bed where he had always lain when welcome sleep came on him
the rank and file go back , withdraw to the ships , but we who claim to be the armies ' finest champions stand our ground — face him first , try to beat him off !
achilles now like inhuman fire raging on through the mountain gorges splinter-dry , setting ablaze big stands of timber , the wind swirling the huge fireball left and right — chaos of fire — achilles storming on with brandished spear like a frenzied god of battle trampling all he killed and the earth ran black with blood
we will fight again tomorrow , until some fatal power decides between our armies , handing victory down to one side or another
hector prays for the sacred dawn to break at once , he threatens to lop the high horns of our sterns and gut our ships with fire , and all our comrades pinned against the hulls , panicked by thick smoke , he will rout and kill in blood !
the snake slowly sweeping along his length among the bowls and polished goblets tasted the feast , then back he slid below the tomb , harmless , slipping away from altars where he ’ d fed
so now they ’ ve sailed away on the wind for home shores , just to rearm , recruit their gods as allies yet again , then measure back their course on the high seas and back they ’ ll come to attack you all off guard
ah , but if— and you often see such things in risky straits— if anything sends me down to death , some god , some twist of fate , you must live on , i say , you ’ re young , your life ’ s worth more than mine
it ’ s not for me to deny him his latin throne ?
now they are even fighting inside their gates , it ’ s combat cut-and-thrust , right on their own ramparts , trenches bathed in blood !
and menelaus whose cry could marshal armies urged both sides , now hear me out as well !
but back in lycaon 's halls are eleven war-cars , beauties all , fresh from the smith and fire-new and blankets spread across them
and next his entire army was moving out across the plain , rich in cavalry , rich in braided cloaks , bright gold
put up your fists , fight for what you are worth
if you can really keep your promise to priam now , who promised his daughter — a true blood-wedding day !
topping your crest the swan plumes toss , a fabulous mark of your father ’ s altered form , and all for offending you , love , you and venus
my descent the same as yours — crooked-minded cronus fathered me as well , the first of all his daughters , first both ways : both by birth and since i am called your consort and you in turn rule all the immortal gods
at last , when young dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more , the people massed around illustrious hector 's pyre
there — pirithous ' son the rugged polypoetes skewered damasus , pierced his bronze-sided helmet
but then again , the same beasts are trained to harness as teams and bow to the yoke , at one with bit and bridle
undaunted hercules had enough— furious , headlong down he leapt through the flames where the thickest smoke was massing , black clouds of it seething up and down the enormous cavern
but why debate , my friend , why thrash things out ?
just as he shot past the matchless runner achilles speared him square in the back where his war-belt clasped , golden buckles clinching both halves of his breastplate — straight on through went the point and out the navel , down on his knees he dropped — screaming shrill as the world went black before him — clutched his bowels to his body , hunched and sank
here little petelia built by philoctetes , the meliboean chief , lies safe behind its walls
covered him head to foot in a thin light sheet and over his body spread the white linen shroud
next antilochus slaughtered phalces , mermerus — meriones killed off morys , killed hippotion , teucer cut down periphetes and prothoon
protect me , escort me now — if the gods will it so — all the way till i reach achilles ' shelter
best to return at once , give the achaeans a full report , defeating as it is
he was pruning a young fig with his sharp bronze hook , cutting green branches to bend for chariot-rails when a sudden blow came down on him in the dark — the grim marauder achilles
but not yet did the argives give way to assault — no , they stopped the breaches up with oxhide shields and down from the breastwork heights they hurled rocks at the enemy coming on beneath the wall
full battle-gear , take up your slashing bronze lances
in his command sailed twelve ships , prows flashing crimson
he swept her up from ephyra , from the selleis river after he would ravaged many towns of brave young warlords bred by the gods
a piercing shriek — she reeled and dropped her son
i will give you a sign
here the god of the earthquake drove his horses down , he set them free of the yoke and flung before them heaps of ambrosia , fodder for them to graze
back i go to the shades to fill the tally out
come , follow my orders !
now , of course , we burn to question him , urge him to explain— blind to how false the cunning greeks could be
long before that , old age will overtake her in my house , in argos , far from her fatherland , slaving back and forth at the loom , forced to share my bed !
but how should i greet a young girl like you ?
and aeneas knows nothing , the man is miles away
the rutulians reel , looking about , but now nisus , all the bolder , watch , cocking another spear beside his ear as the enemy panics—hurls and the shaft goes hissing right through tagus ’ brow , splitting it , sticking deep in the man ’ s warm brains
a prayer to zeus
yes , we will keep clear of the war as you command
with that the dream departed , leaving him there , his heart racing with hopes that would not come to pass
then priam the son of dardanus rose among them , a man who could match the gods for strong advice , and with good will toward all he swayed his people : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies — i must speak out what the heart inside me urges
she entangles one man , now another
so ajax stood his ground over brave patroclus now — the fighting atrides right beside him , standing fast , his grief mounting , every waiting moment
do not go forth , a champion pitted against him — merciless , brutal man
so he mocked and the goddess fled the front , beside herself with pain
here , mourned in the world above and fallen dead in battle , sons of dardanus , chiefs arrayed in a long ranked line
arcadians throng to gateways , grasping funeral brands in the old archaic way
so each of you here must take what blows he sends
racing prothous led them on and in his command sailed forty long black ships
each man shouted out commands to his driver , quickly , rein the team by the trench , good battle-order now !
and any trojan so weighed down , so oppressed by his own possessions , let him collect the lot , pass them round to the people — a grand public feast
there is a city , corinth , deep in a bend of argos , good stallion-country where sisyphus used to live , the wiliest man alive
and the oarsmen don their wreaths of poplar leaves , oil poured on their naked shoulders makes them glisten
what need to tell of the lapiths , ixion , or pirithous ?
oh i know it , the son of cronus has terrified you — your everlasting husband !
mourning done , he commands his troops to lift the stricken body high and sends a thousand men , picked from the whole corps to escort the rites and join in the father ’ s tears
but white-armed andromache — hector could not find her in the halls
but the lord of men agamemnon sacrificed a fat rich ox , five years old , to the son of mighty cronus , zeus , and called the chiefs of all the argive forces : nestor first and foremost , then king idomeneus , the great and little ajax , tydeus ' son diomedes and odysseus sixth , a mastermind like zeus
he was the challenger , he with his lust for battle
to seaward , carians , paeonian men with bent bows , leleges and cauconians , crack pelasgians — inland , toward thymbra , camp the lycians , swaggering mysians , fighting phrygian horsemen , maeonian chariot-drivers — but why interrogate me down to the last platoon ?
aeneas the trojan , plucked from libya ’ s heavy seas
no laws of my native land can bind me here
the messenger with her rosy lips bestirred the king : turnus , what no god would dare to promise you— the answer to your prayers— time in its rounds has brought you all unasked
but did i give way ?
even forced to withdraw she swerves her bow and showers arrows , wheeling in full flight
what brings you to our house ?
we look for evander
not for a moment
then , for a fact , i now could end this agony , keep my brother company down among the shades
eternal peace , sealed with the bonds of marriage
he was lifting a golden cup and pouring wine , glistening wine to go with the glowing victim
why should i help troy ?
no one but agamemnon — he is the one who sent you for briseis
that would avenge what he has done to hector — no coward the man achilles killed — my son stood and fought for the men of troy and their deep-breasted wives with never a thought of flight or run for cover !
true , athena held her peace and said nothing
even palinurus , he swears he can ’ t tell night from day , scanning the heavens he finds nothing but walls of sea , the pilot ’ s bearings lost
but athena , her eyes afire , grabbed the flying shaft , flicked it over the car and off it flew for nothing — and after him diomedes yelled his war cry , lunging out with his own bronze spear and pallas rammed it home , deep in ares ' bowels where the belt cinched him tight
and aeneas froze there , terrified , taking in the din : what are the crimes , what kinds ?
enemies mixing in with their own ranks crowd them hard , nor can they find escape from a wretched death , no , right at the entrance , just in their native walls , in the safe retreat of home they ’ re pierced by spears and pant their lives away
one crew , stung by the shame of losing victory now with glory won , would trade their lives for fame
the enormous snake becomes the gold choker around her throat , the raveling end of a headband braiding through her hair , writhing over her body
i ask no more than the realm my fate decrees : let the trojans rest in latium , they and their roaming gods , their rootless powers !
there was a stag , a rare beauty , antlers branching , torn from his mother ’ s dugs
and with all his royal weight atrides thundered , antilochus — you used to have good sense !
but why in my torment hold the trojans back from battle ?
none dared remain at rest as zeus advanced , they all sprang up to greet him face-to-face as he took his place before them on his throne
lord of the lightning , king of the black cloud , what are you saying ?
his own son commands the sentry-line , he and idomeneus ' aide meriones
our men fight with him
watching , rigid , suddenly warmth leaves her bones , she faints , and after a long pause barely finds the breath to whisper : that face , it ’ s really you ?
there—never forget—your hands must labor to build your first houses , ring them round with mounds
i hold the gods to blame
shameless , inveterate — armored in shamelessness !
i ’ ve stood up against his weapons , we ’ ve gone man to man
from there they labor along the charted path and at last they gain the utmost outer fields where throngs of the great war heroes live apart
he quickly called hippolochus ' son : glaucus , why do they hold us both in honor , first by far with pride of place , choice meats and brimming cups , in lycia where all our people look on us like gods ?
though i never forgot my courage , i can tell you — not i , there at the front where we win glory , there i take my stand whenever a pitched battle rears its head
he balked at killing the man — he would some respect at least — but he quickly sent him off to lycia , gave him tokens , murderous signs , scratched in a folded tablet , and many of them too , enough to kill a man
olympian zeus himself had launched him into the clean light of day
and storming zeus was stirring up apollo : on with it now — sweep sarpedon clear of the weapons , phoebus my friend , and once you wipe the dark blood from his body , bear him far from the fighting , off and away , and bathe him well in a river 's running tides and anoint him with deathless oils
and here i am in a distant land , fighting trojans , and all for that blood-chilling horror , helen !
in fast reply tlepolemus raised his ashen spear and the same moment shafts flew from their hands and sarpedon hit him square across the neck , the spear went ramming through — pure agony — black night came swirling down across his eyes
the famed achilles towered over them all , he and the battle-team that bore the peerless son of peleus into war
if it really was achilles who reared beside the ships , all the worse for him — if he wants his fill of war
now what if one of them saw you , rolling blithely on through the rushing night with so much tempting treasure — how would you feel then ?
dug in , backs to the sea , land of our fathers far away !
the work done , the feast laid out , they ate well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
with that , the river sank low in his deep pool , heading down to the depths as aeneas , night and slumber over , gazing toward the sunlight climbing up the sky , rises , duly draws up water in cupped hands and pours forth this prayer to heaven ’ s heights : you nymphs , laurentine nymphs , you springs of rivers , and you , father tiber , you and your holy stream , embrace aeneas , shield him from dangers , now at last
the marshal made things clearer : you stay there — so we do not miss one another rushing back and forth in the endless maze of pathways up and down the camp
deiphobus stripped away the corpse 's gleaming helmet but quick as the god of war meriones leapt at him , stabbed his outstretched arm and the blank-eyed helmet slipped from his grasp , pounding the ground and clanging
they were shaken , distracted men at priam 's gates but the clearheaded antenor opened up among them : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies , i must speak out what the heart inside me urges
i for one have no desire to battle zeus , not you and i and the rest of the gods together
zeus forbids you to fight for achaea 's armies !
nor would i cause your mother so much grief , dear boy
now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
but he eyed aeneas straight on , he dodged the bronze , ducking down with a quick lunge , and behind his back the heavy spearshaft plunged and stuck in the earth , the butt end quivering into the air till suddenly rugged ares snuffed its fury out , dead still
diomedes killed off axylus , teuthras ' son who had lived in rock-built arisbe , a man of means and a friend to all mankind , at his roadside house he would warm all comers in
fast to the left hand he straps the brazen shield and down from the neck he hangs the ivory-hilted sword
ladon he butchers , pheres , demodocus— a flash of his sword and he slices off strymonius ’ hand just as it clutched his throat
you wo not persuade me
but already clutching a shaft while teucer aimed meriones leapt to snatch the bow from his hand and quickly swore to the distant deadly archer he would slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs — up under the clouds he glimpsed the fluttering dove and there as she wheeled he hit her right beneath the wing and straight through the heart and out the arrow passed , plunged at meriones ' foot and stabbed the earth hard
who ’ s with me , men , who ’ s first to attack the enemy ?
who could blame the achaeans for chafing , bridling beside the beaked ships ?
and he , he will launch his comrade patroclus into action and glorious hector will cut him down with a spear in front of troy , once patroclus has slaughtered whole battalions of strong young fighting men and among them all , my shining son sarpedon
so the two aeantes kept on beating the trojans off but on they came , assaulting the rear , two in the lead , aeneas the son of anchises flanking glorious hector
our best achaean 's dead — patroclus , a stunning loss to all our armies !
and let apollo drive prince hector back to battle , breathe power back in his lungs , make him forget the pains that rack his heart
come , nothing to fear , pull off your trojan gauntlets !
the man is raving — with all the murderous fury in his heart
so i take to the open sea , an exile outward bound with son and comrades , gods of hearth and home and the great gods themselves
now close beside him the bright-eyed goddess stood and urged him on : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician — what , is this the way ?
nevertheless , one day , when their tour of duty is done at last and they moor in a western haven , all the ships that survived the waves and bore the trojan prince to latium ’ s fields—i will strip them of mortal shape and command them all to be goddesses of the deep like doto , nereus ’ daughter , and galatea too , breasting high , cleaving the frothing waves
there they found the defenders packed , hard-pressed as the lycians ' stalwart lords and captains stormed like a black tornado up against the breastworks — both men flung themselves in attack , the war cries broke
at once tyrrhenus and fierce aconteus charge each other full tilt with their spears , and both are first to crash , shattering down with tremendous impact , splintering ribs of their battle stallions ramming chest to chest
now these horses you ask about , old soldier , they are newcomers , just arrived from thrace
obey my orders , for fear the gods , however many olympus holds , are powerless to protect you when i come to throttle you with my irresistible hands
venus leading , down from the roof i climb and win my way through fires and massing foes
powerful diomedes took his challenge quickly : i will stand and fight , by god , and take the worst but little joy it will bring our comrades now
we embark her too
but once the sun stood striding at high noon , then father zeus held out his sacred golden scales : in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low — one for the trojan horsemen , one for argives armed in bronze — and gripping the beam mid-haft the father raised it high and down went achaea 's day of doom , achaea 's fate settling down on the earth that feeds us all as the fate of troy went lifting toward the sky
he knew that zeus had tipped the scales against him
with that he vanished into the black night
how each man weaves his web will bring him to glory or to grief
the work done , the feast laid out , they ate well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
that thracian , once the power of troy was shattered , our trojan fortunes gone—he joins forces with agamemnon , siding with his victorious arms , and breaks all human laws
no lapse of time , no reverence , nothing tames her , no decree of jove or the fates can break her will , she never rests
halaesus rushes in with auruncan troops and messapus , neptune ’ s son , as well , the brilliant horseman
then each man , lifting his own two-handled cup , poured it out to the gods , and back they went along the ships , odysseus in the lead
oh it ’ s a long tale of crime , long , twisting , dark , but i ’ ll try to trace the high points in their order
the trojans broke our binding truce just now — death and grief to the men of troy hereafter !
and then , last , achilles drew his father 's spear from its socket-stand — weighted , heavy , tough
just now tipping wine to her husband ’ s ashes , she implored hector ’ s shade to visit his tomb , an empty mound of grassy earth , crowned with the double altars she had blessed , a place to shed her tears
so back i go to give achilles the message
either we pluck the man from death and save his life or strike him down at last , here at achilles ' hands — for all his fighting heart
so now the argives drove the ravening fire clear of the warships , winning a little breathing room , not much , no real halt to the buck-and-rush of battle
but there stands turnus now , and amid their hot fury and rising cries of murder , he fires up their fears : trojans are called to share our realm !
pitifully his loving father groaned and round the king his people cried with grief and wailing seized the city — for all the world as if all troy were torched and smoldering down from the looming brows of the citadel to her roots
you can hear the groaning anvils boom with mighty strokes , the hot steel ingots screeching steam in the cavern ’ s troughs and fires panting hard in the furnace—vulcan ’ s home , it bears the name vulcania
gearing for battle , are you ?
look at you , carrying on in the armies ' muster just like boys — fools !
you , you at troy in the halls of king priam — i at thebes , under the timberline of placos , eetion 's house
she speaks out first : you there , young soldiers , did you by any chance see one of my sisters ?
you ’ re beaten , now retreat !
a crash of thunder !
but look , the merciless wife of jove was winging back from argos , inachus ’ city , holding course through the heavens when , from far in the air , as far as sicily ’ s cape pachynus , she spied aeneas exulting , trojan ships at anchor
but the king kept ranging , battling ranks on ranks and thrusting his spear and sword and hurling heavy rocks so long as the blood came flowing warm from his wound
o give him back at once — take ransom for the dead !
but on came hector 's team in the rush-and-buck of battle , sweeping their driver hector on in fighting-fury and then and there old nestor would have died if diomedes had not marked him fast — the lord of the war cry gave a harrowing shout , trying to rouse odysseus : where are you running , the royal son of laertes , cool tactician ?
but since i was blinded and zeus stole my wits , i am intent on setting things to rights , at once : i will give that priceless ransom paid for friendship
she approaches her grieving sister , anna—masking her plan with a brave face aglow with hope , and says : i ’ ve found a way , dear heart—rejoice with your sister—either to bring him back in love for me or free me of love for him
as a snake in the hills , guarding his hole , awaits a man — bloated with poison , deadly hatred seething inside him , glances flashing fire as he coils round his lair
there his brothers and countrymen will bury the prince with full royal rites , with mounded tomb and pillar
they will go to achilles ' tent with all good speed
under his feet he fastened the supple sandals , never-dying gold , that wing him over the waves and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds
who ’ d meet his doom ?
this is the ninth year come round , the ninth we have hung on here
then tros , alastor 's son , crawled to achilles ' knees and clutched them , hoping he would spare him , let tros off alive , no cutting him down in blood , he would pity tros , a man of his own age — the young fool , he would no idea , thinking achilles could be swayed !
and king agamemnon took his lead , saluting : again , old man , you outfight the argives in debate !
quick at zeus 's side the famous lord of earthquakes freed the team , canted the battle-chariot firmly on its base and wrapped it well with a heavy canvas shroud
now i say this to our stallion-breaking trojans , i say no , straight out — i wo not give up the woman !
rumor , vicious as ever , brings her word , already distraught , that trojans are rigging out their galleys , gearing to set sail
what hope has the common soldier in your ranks to be saved by you , hector , you heart of iron ?
fifty fighters aboard each , manning the oarlocks , five captains he named , entrusted with command , but he himself in his martial power ruled them all
in naked daylight i am determined now to ring their walls with fire !
asaeus first , autonous next and then opites , dolops , clytius ' son , and opheltius , agelaus , aesymnus and orus , hipponous staunch in combat
bright as the morning star whom venus loves above all the burning stars on high , when up from his ocean bath he lifts his holy face to the lofty skies and dissolves away the darkness
keep the team close by !
with that the dream went winging off and soothing sleep released me
command us , where do we settle now ?
old menoetes , dead weight in his sodden clothes , struggling up at last from the depths to break the surface , clambered onto the rock and perched there high and dry
again and again he fought for breath , gasping , bathed in sweat rivering down his body , his limbs soaked and sleek
and loosing a savage yell , hector led the way and his captains followed close with unearthly cries and trojan ranks behind them crying shrill
from there—if i recall what i heard—our first father , teucer sailed to troy , cape rhoeteum , picked the point and founded his kingdom on those shores
dolon answered , his legs shaking under him , hector — he duped me so — so many mad , blind hopes !
and veteran menelaus cringed himself but saw the lashing-cords and barbs outside the gash and his courage flooded back inside his chest
a shudder swept all ranks , trojans and argives both , terror-struck by the shriek the god let loose , ares whose lust for slaughter never dies
it 's good-for-nothing — he 's torn your wits away
yes , i gave birth to a flawless , mighty son
so he yielded but now the roar of flames grows louder all through troy and the seething floods of fire are rolling closer
but giant ajax would never fail his fallen brother — he ran to straddle and hide him with his shield as a brace of comrades shouldered up the fighter : echius ' son mecisteus helping good alastor bore him back to the hollow warships , groaning hard
like fires loosed from adverse sides into woodlands dry as tinder , thickets of rustling laurel , or foaming rivers hurling down from a mountain ridge and roaring out to sea , each leaves a path of destruction in its wake
to my brothers ' wives with their long flowing robes ?
now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth , now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes round again
once is enough for him
why , they would scuttle home before they can even learn if the vows of zeus with his dark cloudy shield are false or not
lunging out he whips a spear at the foes he faced and the whizzing javelin hisses , rips the air dead-on— and at that instant a huge outcry , ranks in a wedge in disarray , lines buckling , hearts at a fever pitch as the shaft wings on where a band of nine brothers with fine bodies chanced to block its course
how glad we are to see you , we battle-weary men , after so many deaths , your people dead and gone , after your citizens , your city felt such pain
neptune , you yourself , you ’ re my witness to what great instant chaos she unleashed , just now , in libya ’ s heaving seas , mixing the sea and wind and backed by aeolus ’ blasts , all for nothing , but all dared in your own realm
will agamemnon win me over ?
like a shooting star athena flashed across the earth , plunging down in the midst of both camped forces
find them he did , no longer free of wounds , unhurt — not at all
turnus , the great captain , is blazing on in another zone , stampeding the trojan ranks when the news arrives : the enemy flushed with the latest carnage offers up their gates flung open now
the argives rose in horror to hear that boast , veteran ajax most of all , the anger leapt inside him — prothoenor had dropped at the feet of telamon 's son
he waits by the ships , a man never sated with battle
friendship is much better
mad , blind i was !
impelled by the great omen , hearts filled with joy , they rush to refresh the banquet , set out bowls and crown the wine with wreaths
for that alone he waited , the god who rules the world , to see with his own eyes the first achaean ship go up in a blaze of flames
maybe they have whipped us here but not without a fight will they take our benched ships
but no false respect
hector , helmet flashing , answered nothing
then back to troy they bore him , groaning hard
you call on the winds to sweep you there by sea ?
the boys are now called troy , their troupe the trojan corps
and how we spent that last night , lost in deluded joys , you know
let it be quite enough for fate and venus both that trojans reach the rich green land of italy— trojans !
so i take my plunder — spears , bossed shields , helmets and breastplates , gleaming , polished bright
and i as i walk , i recognize a little troy , a miniature , mimicking our great trojan towers , and a dried-up brook they call the river xanthus , and i put my arms around a cutdown scaean gate
he could bear no more , wheeling off at a distance — shaking his whetted spear he charged achilles now , coming fierce as fire but achilles marked him quickly and springing forth to take him , triumphed to himself , here is the man who 's raked my heart the most , who killed my cherished comrade !
come now , i will give you one of the younger graces — wed her at once and she will be called your wife
shipmates race each other , thrashing the waves and a rising sternwind surges , drives the vessels on
turnus , struck with love , fixing his eyes upon her , fired the more for combat , tells amata , briefly : don ’ t , i beg you , mother , send me off with tears , with evil omens as i go into the jolting shocks of war , since turnus is far from free to defer his death
but father , suspecting at once , cursed me roundly , he screamed out to the cruel furies — 'never , never let me bounce on my knees a son of his , sprung of his loins !
mother bore them both
the outlaw , the adulterer
find him he did , lycaon 's skilled , fearless son , and went right up and challenged him to his face : pandarus , where 's your bow , your winged arrows , your archer 's glory ?
wild as a storm cloud moving off olympus into heaven out of a clear blue sky when zeus brings cyclones on — so wild the rout , the cries that came from the ships as back through the trench they ran , formations wrecked
what more does he want ?
then all that night the long-haired achaeans feasted as trojans and trojan allies took their meal in troy
they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they had put aside desire for food and drink , priam the son of dardanus gazed at achilles , marveling now at the man 's beauty , his magnificent build — face-to-face he seemed a deathless god
oh what fate has overpowered you , robbed of such a husband ?
so they prayed as the old horseman shook the lots and one leapt from the helmet , the one they wanted most — great ajax ' lot it was
whatever you ’ ve started , set it aside , my cyclops of etna , bend to this !
captains of all achaeans !
speak up , from right where you are , not one step more !
so things went in latium
rein your anger in !
so the ship limped in , oars laboring , slowly , and still she spreads her sails and enters the harbor , canvas taut
let no man quit the battle !
lash those pounding stallions straight at patroclus — you might kill him still — apollo might give you glory !
ardea , our forebears called the place in the old days , and the mighty name of ardea still stands firm but its glory is gone forever
the spear goes flying on and it hits the armor high up where the bronze rims the shoulder ’ s ridge , and glancing off , it rams its way through the shield ’ s plies and finally scrapes the skin of turnus ’ massive body
even before the contest ended , great aeneas calls epytides over , friend and bodyguard of the young iulus , and whispers in his trusted ear : go , and if ascanius has his troupe of boys prepared , their horses mustered to ride through their maneuvers , have him parade his squadrons now , to honor anchises here and display himself in arms
waiting , tense , he probed his own brave spirit : ah dear god — if i run from achilles ' onslaught , taking the route the rest have fled , stampeding , he will catch me even so and slash my coward 's throat
i warn you both — so help me it 's the truth — no more grooming for you at nestor 's hands !
mothers scatter in panic down the palace halls and embrace the pillars , cling to them , kiss them hard
hector , i urge you first of all — do as i tell you
and hector too — how could he hold back with his massing , armored trojans ?
i wish hector had killed me , the best man bred in troy — the killer a hero then and a hero too the man whose corpse he stripped !
they saw zeus turn the tide toward the trojans
you would set him free from all the pains of death ?
you are both great fighters — we all know that full well
dolon leapt to it , he quickly slung a reflex bow on his back , over it threw the pelt of a gray wolf and set on his head a cap of weasel skin and taking a sharp spear , moved out from camp , heading toward the fleet — but he was never to come back from the enemy 's beaked ships , bringing hector news
seeing priam decked in the arms he ’ d worn as a young man , are you insane ?
this was juno ’ s goal from the start , and so she nursed her city ’ s strength
she stood on odysseus ' huge black-bellied hull , moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings , upshore to telamonian ajax ' camp or down to achilles ' — trusting so to their arms ' power and battle-strengththey would hauled their trim ships up on either flank
once he has fitted shield to hip and harness to his back , he clasps ascanius fast in an iron-clad embrace and kissing him lightly through his visor , says : learn courage from me , my son , true hardship too
they had no love for stand-and-fight encounters — had no crested bronze helmets to guard their heads , no balanced shields in their grasp , no ashen spears , only their bows and slings of springy , twisted wool
under his brows he glared at royal hector , shouting , quick , charge me — the sooner to meet your death !
stave off his hunger now
staunch as a pillar planted tall above a barrow , standing sentry over some lord or lady 's grave-site , so they stood , holding the blazoned chariot stock-still , their heads trailing along the ground , warm tears flowing down from their eyes to wet the earth
he stood in awe of his mother 's strict command
i have just come up from the ships to scout the plain — at dawn the fiery-eyed achaeans fight around the city
so at last we avenged our comrades ’ shades—elated
both born to the same fate after all !
menelaus took the hardened captain hyperenor , gouged his flank and the bronze ripped him open , spurting his entrails out — and his life , gushing forth through the raw , yawning wound , went pulsing fast and the dark came swirling down across his eyes
then the men who lived in buprasion , brilliant elis , all the realm as far as hyrmine and myrsinus , frontier towns and olenian rock and alesion bound within their borders
off in his beaked seagoing ships achilles lies , raging away at agamemnon , marshal of armies — but here we are , strong enough to engage you , and plenty of us too
now over the high seas we raise up woody zacynthos , dulichium , same , neritos ’ crags , past ithaca ’ s rocky coast we race , laertes ’ realm , cursing the land that spawned the vicious ulysses
i can see the blaze go roaring up the ships
go , give him my message , start to finish — and see that every word of it rings exactly so
come , help me unroll the massive scroll of war !
and once they reached the plains of troy where the two rivers flow , where simois and scamander rush together , the white-armed goddess hera reined her team , loosing them from the chariot-yoke and round them poured a dense shrouding mist and before their hoofs the simois sprang ambrosial grass for them to graze
what i needed was men to shield our helpless children , fighting men to defend our trojan women — all-out — against these savage argives
where are the younger troopers now we need them ?
in all this slaughter he slips away , taking flight to rutulian soil , shielded by turnus ’ armies , his old friend
but look—clausus , born of the age-old sabine blood , heading a mighty force , a mighty force himself
king latinus , already old , had governed the fields and towns through long years of peace
now the goddess dawn climbed up to olympus heights , declaring the light of day to zeus and the deathless gods as the king commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and muster the long-haired achaeans to full assembly
acestes is our host
and there in the midst the grand , glowing cup the old king brought from home , studded with golden nails , fitted with handles , four all told and two doves perched on each , heads bending to drink and made of solid gold and twin supports ran down to form the base
but his brothers , a phalanx up in arms , enflamed by grief , some tear swords from sheaths and some snatch up their spears and all press blindly on
wherever camilla rages , plunging into the front , there arruns stalks her , quietly tracks her steps ; whenever she downs a foe and turns around for home , round he tugs at his fast reins and ducks from sight
a nightmare hovered above his head that night — diomedes himself !
he plowed forward , testing enemy lines at all points to see if they would crack before him — charging under his shield but he could not overpower the argives ' stiff resolve and ajax hulking forward with big strides , the first to challenge hector : madman !
a messenger brought me word from zeus — my mother , thetis who bore me , the old man of the sea 's daughter
if not , i swear , atrides could never have roused the fury in me , the rage that would not die , or wrenched the girl away against my will — stubborn , implacable man
the horse stands open wide , fighters in high spirits pouring out of its timbered cavern into the fresh air : the chiefs , thessandrus , sthenelus , ruthless ulysses rappeling down a rope they dropped from its side , and acamas , thoas , neoptolemus , son of achilles , captain machaon , menelaus , epeus himself , the man who built that masterpiece of fraud
but turnus , balancing long his oakwood spear with its iron tip , flings it at pallas with winging words : now we ’ ll see if my spear pierces deeper !
there — aeneas lunged and speared leocritus through , a son of arisbas , lycomedes ' die-hard friend
their own bravado killed them
aeneas challenges me alone ?
so swiftly juturna drives her team at the trojan center , darts along in her chariot whirling through the field , now here , there , displaying her brother in his glory , true , but she never lets him come to grips , she swerves far away
laocoön , the priest of neptune picked by lot , was sacrificing a massive bull at the holy altar when—i cringe to recall it now—look there !
and you , odysseus , i tell you , i command you : pick out young men , the best in our joint forces , bring forth the gifts from my ship , all we promised achilles just the other day , and bring the women too
were i passing the hours , an exile lost in the swirling sands of carthage or caught in greek seas , imprisoned in mycenae , i would still perform my anniversary vows , carry out our processions grand and grave and heap the altars high with fitting gifts
they were fighting far afield of the deep-sea ships , beneath the trojan wall , so achilles never feared his friend was dead — he must be still alive , pressing on to the very gates , but he would come back
all at once , as he took to heart the struggles he beheld , venus approached in rare sorrow , tears abrim in her sparkling eyes , and begged : oh you who rule the lives of men and gods with your everlasting laws and your lightning bolt of terror , what crime could my aeneas commit against you , what dire harm could the trojans do that after bearing so many losses , this wide world is shut to them now ?
what god , what ruthless power of mine drove him to ruin ?
fine wheels with fellies of solid , deathless gold and round them running rims of bronze clamped fast — a marvel to behold !
the ship-race over , good aeneas strides to the grassy level field ringed by hills with woodland sloping down to a vale that formed an enormous round arena
even the gods , i say , with incense , soothing vows , with full cups poured and the deep smoky savor men can bring them round , begging for pardon when one oversteps the mark , does something wrong
just in the midst of these , these outcries , look , a winging arrow whizzes in and it hits aeneas
first came the boeotian units led by leitus and peneleos : arcesilaus and prothoenor and clonius shared command of the armed men who lived in hyria , rocky aulis , schoenus , scolus and eteonus spurred with hills , thespia and graea , the dancing rings of mycalessus , men who lived round harma , ilesion and erythrae and those who settled eleon , hyle and peteon , ocalea , medeon 's fortress walled and strong , copae , eutresis and thisbe thronged with doves , fighters from coronea , haliartus deep in meadows , and the men who held plataea and lived in glisas , men who held the rough-hewn gates of lower thebes , onchestus the holy , poseidon 's sun-filled grove , men from the town of arne green with vineyards , midea and sacred nisa , anthedon-on-the-marches
and deiphobus taking aim with his big glinting spear , forever hating the man and he hurled and missed again — but deiphobus hit ascalaphus with that shaft , ascalaphus son of the butcher god of battles — the heavy spearshaft ran him through the shoulder and down he thundered , scraping , clutching the dust
surging up from the sea he came to join their ranks , took a seat in their midst and probed zeus 's plans : why now , great king of the lightning , why summon the gods to council once again ?
that was your aged father 's parting advice
not to be tossed aside , the gifts of the gods , those glories
none i know of
first he cinched him round with the boxer 's belt then taking rawhide thongs , cut from a field-ox , wrapped his knuckles well
the string sang out , arrow shot away razor-sharp and raging to whip through argive ranks !
for they had many dead , and some they bury in earth , some they lift and bear off to the nearby fields and the other dead they carry back to town
a whirl of his spear and turnus sends asbytes to join him , chloreus too and sybaris , dares , thersilochus , then thymoetes , pitched down over the neck of his bucking horse
bantering so , but he flattered swift achilles and the matchless runner paid him back in kind : antilochus , how can i let your praise go unrewarded ?
none among all the armies
here the auruncans and rutulians sow their crops , plow the rugged hills and graze the wildest banks
you sit here , keep drinking the shining wine now , till well-kempt hecamede draws you a warm bath , steaming hot , and washes away that clotted blood
i am agony — mother of grief and greatness — o my child !
better , no , to settle down on their country ’ s dying ashes , the ground where troy once stood ?
dione the light and loveliest of immortals tried to calm her : patience , oh my child
three brave sons were born of the loins of portheus : they made their homes in pleuron and craggy calydon , agrius first , then melas , the horseman oeneus third , my father 's father , the bravest of them all
but cacus , desperate bandit , wild to leave no crime , no treachery undared , untested , stole from their steadings four champion bulls and as many head of first-rate , well-built heifers
devout aeneas offers her up to you , queen juno on high , a blood sacrifice to you , standing her at your altar with her young
such maddened words he hurls but no words come from aeneas now— he hurls his spear in reply against his foe and then as lucagus , bending into the stroke , slaps the team with his flat sword , his left foot thrust out , braced for attack , aeneas ’ weapon pierces the bottom plies of his gleaming buckler , ripping into his left groin
he 's gone and snatched a corpse from under our noses , single-handed he 's taken down your trusted comrade brave in the front ranks , podes , eetion 's son
and many pale-white oxen sank on the iron knife , gasping in slaughter , many sheep and bleating goats and droves of swine with their long glinting tusks , succulent , rich with fat
he was enraged by the curses of his mother , volleys of curses she called down from the gods
when up rushed agamemnon , blocking his way and shouting out , so soft , dear brother , why ?
that girl the sons of achaea picked out for his prize — right from his grasp the mighty agamemnon tore her , and grief for her has been gnawing at his heart
darkness , everywhere , closing in around me
i know it well myself
flinging his slander , ranting taunts—ascanius had enough
why , to witness your luckless brother ’ s painful death ?
keep your armor that gave you so much joy
i was rustling their cattle in reprisal , you see , and he defending his herds , when a spear i hurled caught him right in the front ranks of herdsmen — down he went and round him his yokel drovers scattered home in panic
so when they make their roaring swoop along the bay , misenus , poised on a lookout , sounds the alarm , a brazen trumpet blast , and the men attack , geared for a strange new form of combat , fighting to hack these vile seabirds down with bloody swords
wars , horrendous wars , and the tiber foaming with tides of blood , i see it all !
haven ’ t they seen troy ’ s ramparts , built by neptune ’ s hands , collapse in flames ?
but you have got the slowest nags — a handicap , i would say
and so we make our way along the pitch-dark paths , and i who had never flinched at the hurtling spears or swarming greek assaults— now every stir of wind , every whisper of sound alarms me , anxious both for the child beside me and burden on my back
let him outfight the great achilles , strap on armor the match for his , forged by vulcan ’ s hands
best of the lot , the beauties we hand you first , whenever we take some stronghold
camilla ’ s finest hour now as dawn rose up and left her ocean bed , aeneas , moved as he is by grief to pause and bury comrades , desolate with their deaths , still the victor pays his vows to the gods as first light breaks
armed to the hilt they work the earth , their constant joy to haul fresh booty home and live off all they seize
wasn ’ t it he who exposed your wretched trojans to the greeks ?
how on earth can we hang back from combat now ?
they were the bravest champions born in corinth , in lycia far and wide
shrouding herself in her glinting silver robes she went along , in silence
let 's try again — this time he will taste my spearpoint
the realms of your father , daunus , are yours to manage , so are the many towns your right arm took by force
cocles dared to rip the bridge down , cloelia burst her chains and swam the flood
antilochus marked him now , great nestor 's son went racing across the front himself , terrified for the lord of armies — what if he were killed ?
so men before your time stormed walls and cities , holding fast to that tactic , warring on with heart
flee headlong while you can !
they hung on his words , complied , rushed to prepare the meal , and each man feasted well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
no letup , no lance spared !
but we can spur the rest of them into battle , all who had nursed some private grudge before , kept to the rear and shunned the grueling forays
once you have whipped the enemy from the fleet you must come back , patroclus
i beg you , give them all safe passage across your waters , let them reach the tiber— if only my prayers are granted , if fate will grant the trojans city walls
— to spread and couple , to bed down for yourself apart from all the troops ?
i happen to have some sea-nymphs , fourteen beauties , deiopea the finest of all by far
weaker i am , but i still might take your life with one hurl of a spear — my weapon can cut too , long before now its point has found its mark !
look at each of you , sitting there , lifeless , lust for glory gone
in that spirit , with all his might he hurled a huge spear straight into the monster ’ s flanks , the mortised timberwork of its swollen belly
don ’ t let my honor , my fame be torn from its high place , or the sons of aeneas bring latinus round with their lures of marriage , besieging italian soil
now i leave her , unaware of the risk i run , whatever it is , with no parting words because— i swear by the night and your right hand—i can not bear the sight of my mother ’ s tears
so does helymus , so does acestes ripe in years , the boy ascanius too , and the other young men take his lead
and powerful diomedes bowed to her at once : well i know you , goddess , daughter of storming zeus , and so i will tell you all , gladly
down he crashed and the darkness swirled his eyes with antilochus rushing over him like some hound pouncing down on a deer that 's just been wounded — leaping out of its lair a hunter 's speared it , a lethal hit that 's loosed its springy limbs
three times i tried to fling my arms around her neck , three times i embraced—nothing
first and best the gods will give , and your own sense of worth
so ram him straight on with your tough bronze !
as he bravely heaves and hauls , the goddess juturna , changing back again to the charioteer metiscus , rushes in and returns her brother ’ s sword to turnus
deep in grief while his father , weeping freely , walked beside them now
no long way off , i think , there are friendly shores , the coast of your brother eryx , sicily ’ s havens , if i remember rightly and take our bearings back by the stars i marked when we set out
then let us collect the bones of menoetius ' son patroclus , pick them out with care — but they can not be mistaken : he lay amidst the pyre , apart from all the others burned at the edge , the ruck of men and horses
messapus heads the column , the rear ’ s brought up by the sons of tyrrhus , turnus commands the center : a force like the ganges rising , fed by seven quiet streams or the life-giving nile ebbing back from the plains to settle down at last in its own banks and bed
as for aeneas , let the man be tossed on strange new seas , follow the course where fortune leads the way
so he decrees and speeds the son of maia down the sky to make the lands and the new stronghold , carthage , open in welcome to the trojans , not let dido , unaware of fate , expel them from her borders
your son , whom in the old days at troy
helmet flashing , rangy hector hurled a resounding yell : diomedes — once the danaan riders prized you first of men with pride of place , choice meats and brimming cups
i had already whipped an arrow into him , caught him square in the right shoulder too , just where the breastplate leaves the armpit bare , and i thought i would sent him down to the house of death but i have still not laid him low
years ago i visited phrygia rife with vineyards , saw the phrygian men with their swarming horses there — multitudes — the armies of otreus , mygdon like a god , encamped that time along the sangarius river banks
all he did was love his unlucky friend too well !
but if some deeper longing for mercy stirs beneath your prayers , some notion the whole thrust of the war can shift and change , you ’ re feeding empty hopes
the watchdog buried now in sleep , aeneas seizes the way in , quickly clear of the river ’ s edge , the point of no return
athena thrust from their eyes the blinding battle-haze , the darkness sent by the gods , and a hard bright light burst down in both directions , out to the ships and down the lines where fighting drew dead even
the attempts to heal enflame the fever more
his people hung on his words and all obeyed the king
no anger , please , great priestess , begged deiphobus
closing against each other , just about in range , the magnificent runner achilles opened up , who on earth are you ?
but his turn next — menelaus reared with a bronze lance and a prayer to father zeus : zeus , king , give me revenge , he wronged me first !
pity the ones whose sons stand up to me in war !
but why do i linger on ?
do as you please — but none of the deathless gods will ever praise you
he winged athena on with a flight of orders : quickly !
achilles the son of lovely sleek-haired thetis — the man 's not even fighting , no , he wallows in all his heartsick fury by the ships !
year in , year out , the urn stands ready , the fateful lots are drawn
but the swift runner replied , immortal iris — what god has sped you here to tell me this ?
but the people were not surrendering , not at all
they tell how alpheus , the elean river , forcing his passage undersea by secret channels , now , arethusa , mixes streams at your fountain ’ s mouth with your sicilian waters
dardan fighters hand-to-hand — now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
there on the burnished shield , io , blazoned in gold , her horns raised , her skin already bristly with hair , already changed to a cow— an awesome emblem—as argus guards the girl and father inachus pours his stream from a chased urn
across the alean plain he wandered , all alone , eating his heart out , a fugitive on the run from the beaten tracks of men
that daredevil diomedes , he would fight father zeus !
the tyrians press on with the work , some aligning the walls , struggling to raise the citadel , trundling stones up slopes ; some picking the building sites and plowing out their boundaries , others drafting laws , electing judges , a senate held in awe
soon as the warrior menelaus marked him , paris parading there with his big loping strides , flaunting before the troops , atrides thrilled like a lion lighting on some handsome carcass , lucky to find an antlered stag or wild goat just as hunger strikes — he rips it , bolts it down , even with running dogs and lusty hunters rushing him
arcadia ’ s prime he hacks down , hacks down the tuscans and you whose bodies went unscarred by the greeks , you trojans too
up in arms as they were to shield themselves , they took his word to heart and round the ships they raised a wall of bronze
aeneas , astonished , stirred by the tumult , calls out : tell me , sibyl , what does it mean , this thronging toward the river ?
there the old man lay , awaiting shining dawn
i follow a sign so clear , whoever you are who calls me into action
she was weaving at her loom , deep in the high halls , working flowered braiding into a dark red folding robe
so now menelaus drew his sword with silver studs and hoisting the weapon high , brought it crashing down on the helmet ridge but the blade smashed where it struck — jagged shatters flying — it dropped from atrides ' hand and the hero cried out , scanning the blank skies , father zeus — no god 's more deadly than you !
anna , you see the hurly-burly all across the beach , the crews swarming from every quarter ?
well i know , shift to the left , shift to the right my tough tanned shield
the grim star of minerva , she bears witness , so do euboea ’ s crags and caphereus ’ vengeful cliffs
— zeus who gathers the breasting clouds replied , that is a journey you can make tomorrow
we swept down from olympus , all to join this fight so achilles might not fall at trojan hands today
the famous runner achilles rose to his challenge : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician
how can i force them back to sea once more , command them to spread their sails to the winds ?
next time , trust me , you will pay for your crimes with more than just a scolding
daedalus , so the story ’ s told , fleeing the realm of minos , daring to trust himself to the sky on beating wings , floated up to the icy north , the first man to fly , and hovered lightly on cumae ’ s heights at last
no one , i say — no one alive less soldierly than you , none in the ranks that came to troy with agamemnon
don ’ t abandon your sworn bride !
then messapus , just sprinting along with a pair of steel-tipped spears in his left hand , training one on the trojan , lets it fly— right on target
eight arrows i have let fly , with long sharp barbs , and all stuck in the flesh of soldiers quick to fight — but i still ca not bring this mad dog hector down !
their sons ’ sons will see , wherever the wheeling sun looks down on the ocean , rising or setting , east or west , the whole earth turn beneath their feet , their rule !
on they went , those dim travelers under the lonely night , through gloom and the empty halls of death ’ s ghostly realm , like those who walk through woods by a grudging moon ’ s deceptive light when jove has plunged the sky in dark and the black night drains all color from the world
since she was dying a death not fated or deserved , no , tormented , before her day , in a blaze of passion— proserpina had yet to pluck a golden lock from her head and commit her life to the styx and the dark world below
and now the royal kings fell in with nestor
you would be the first to blame a man who railed this way
and hector called to his men in a ringing voice , trojans !
can ’ t you see the dangers closing around you now ?
desert us , leave us now—to whom ?
so you are that man 's sons ?
down she swoops , hurled to earth by a whirlwind , swift as a darting arrow whipped from a bowstring through the clouds , a shaft armed by a parthian , tipped with deadly poison , shot by a parthian or a cretan archer—well past any cure— hissing on unseen through the rushing dark
as her beauty ’ s due , proserpina decreed this bough shall be offered up to her as her own hallowed gift
as massive as athos , massive as eryx or even father apennine himself , roaring out with his glistening oaks , elated to raise his snow-capped brow to the winds
there he is in the bedroom , the bed with inlaid rings — he 's glistening in all his beauty and his robes !
so come , follow my orders
if only i were as sure of immortality , ageless all my days — and i were prized as they prize athena and apollo — as surely as this day will bring the argives death !
yet he ’ s losing touch with himself , racing , hoisting that massive rock in his hands and hurling , true , but his knees buckle , blood ’ s like ice in his veins and the rock he flings through the air , plummeting under its own weight , can not cover the space between them , can not strike full force
persuade him , somehow , to help the trojan cause , to pin the achaeans back against their ships , trap them round the bay and mow them down
even tremendous hades had to endure that flying shaft like all the rest , when the same man , the son of thunder-shielded zeus , shot him in pylos — there with the troops of battle dead — and surrendered death to pain
it 's madness to drive our teams across that trench , impossible to traverse it
and you , the rest of you argives , listen closely : every man of you here , mark each word i say
and a thick cloud of dust rose up from the man they dragged , his dark hair swirling round that head so handsome once , all tumbled low in the dust — since zeus had given him over to his enemies now to be defiled in the land of his own fathers
he raised you when you were little , a bastard boy , no matter — telamon tended you in his own house
by the will of zeus , i suppose , and other deathless gods
strophades—greek name for the turning islands— lie in the great ionian sea
so now , now we will see if achilles kills us both and hauls our bloody armor back to the beaked ships or he goes down in pain beneath your spear
against their will the two men made their way along the breaking surf of the barren salt sea and reached the myrmidon shelters and their ships
but he holds firm , unafraid , awaiting his great-hearted foe , stands firm in all his mass
a tremor ran through all the myrmidon ranks — none dared to look straight at the glare , each fighter shrank away
and now , again , the fight for patroclus flared , stretched to the breaking point , mounting in tears , in fury , since pallas fired their blood , sweeping down from the heavens , sent by the father thundering far and wide to drive the argives on , for now his mind had changed , at least for a moment
over the earth all weary living things , all birds and flocks were fast asleep when captain aeneas , his heart racked by the threat of war , lay down on a bank beneath the chilly arc of the sky and at long last indulged his limbs in sleep
or was it all a dream ?
here grim celaeno and sister harpies settled after phineus ’ doors were locked against them all and they fled in fear from the tables where they ’ d gorged
and then i put the brain of thundering zeus to sleep , pouring myself in a soft , soothing slumber round him
you ’ ll tell the ghost of priam you found an achilles—even here !
we offer up full bowls , foaming with warm milk , and our cups of hallowed blood
soon as he finds his breath the prince breaks out : the anguish you bear for my sake , generous king , for my sake , i beg you , wipe it from your mind
when we shook the lots i drew the sea , my foaming eternal home , and hades drew the land of the dead engulfed in haze and night and zeus drew the heavens , the clouds and the high clear sky , but the earth and olympus heights are common to us all
he strode from the rampart , took his stand at the trench but he would not mix with the milling argive ranks
three times the brilliant runner achilles charged him , lunged with his bronze spear , three times he slashed at cloud — then at achilles ' fourth assault like something superhuman his terrifying voice burst out in winging words : now , again , you have escaped your death , you dog , but a good close brush with death it was , i would say !
no more thoughts of retreat paraded before our people
but if such terror grips our hearts and minds , let us beg a favor of our fine prince
so by the beaked ships the argives formed for battle , arming round you , achilles — achilles starved for war — and faced by the trojan ranks along the plain 's high ground
and such good sense — your parents must be blissful as the gods !
pelasgian lethus ' son , lashing a shield-strap round the ankle tendons , was hauling patroclus footfirst through the melee , hoping to please prince hector and all the trojans , hippothous rushing on but death came just as fast
what brings you to our house ?
so , it ’ s wrong for italians to ring your newborn troy with fire ?
diomedes shuddered to see him coming on , the lord of the war cry called out to odysseus quickly , close beside him , we are in for shipwreck — a breaker rolling down on us , look , this massive hector !
but soon as he heard the trojans storm the wall and shouts rise from achaeans lost in panic rout , patroclus gave a groan and slapping his thighs hard with the flats of both hands , burst forth in anguish : i ca not stay here with you any longer , eurypylus , much as you need me — there , a great battle breaks !
we have fighting men by the hundreds still inside her , forming a wall before our loving parents , wives and sons to defend troy — where you rush on to meet your doom , headlong man as you are , breakneck man of war !
hurl your fire now — a blazing inferno of fire against their ships !
all hope gone that murderous hector 's rage and invincible spear-arm can be stopped — not now — he will hurl himself against our blackened hulls !
now the victory is yours
why this deep debate ?
for you the grove of angitia wept , for you the crystal swells of fucinus lake , for you the clear quiet pools
but the day will come when father , well i know , calls me his darling gray-eyed girl again
why , he ’ d even bind together dead bodies and living men , couple them tightly , hand to hand and mouth to mouth— what torture—so in that poison , oozing putrid slime they ’ d die by inches , locked in their brute embrace
and we ourselves are mowed down in droves ?
not for his son who breathed his last in battle
they streamed out at the gates to meet priam bringing in the body of the dead
tell me , muse , how it all began
the men themselves dried off their sweat-soaked shirts , standing against the wind that whipped along the surf , then entered the tent and took their seats on settles
he 's not inviting them to a dance , believe me — he commands them into battle !
with that achilles pulled his bronze spear from the river bluff and left him there , the trojan 's life slashed out , sprawled in the sand , drenched by the black tide — eels and fish the corpse 's frenzied attendants ripping into him , nibbling kidney-fat away
and still the rest fought on , relentless war cries rising
with that , he gave patroclus a sharp glance , a quiet nod to pile the bedding deep for phoenix now , a sign to the rest to think of leaving quickly
such disasters were in the stars , from that day on that i like a maniac attacked an immortal ’ s body , my sword defiled the hand of venus with a wound !
the king cried out and clambered down to ground from the high tower , issuing quick commands to veteran gateway guards beside the walls : spread the great gates wide — all hands now — till our routed troops can straggle back to troy !
you and your anger — rage away !
over his right shoulder , down his flank he straps an arcadian sword , swirling back the skin of a panther to drape his left side
nor would it be the first time i have had to face the matchless , headlong runner
now we must win high honor for peleus ' royal son , far the greatest fighter among the argive fleet , and we who fight beside him the bravest troops — so even mighty atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace achilles , the best of the achaeans !
with a dark glance the shrewd tactician odysseus wheeled on his commander : what 's this , atrides , this talk that slips from your clenched teeth ?
fronting the temple doors , i bolt the brazen shield great abas bore , and i engrave the offering with a verse : then i command the crews to embark from harbor , man the thwarts
flying up to the swirling clouds the arrow shot into flames , blazing its way in fire , burning out into thin air , lost like the shooting stars that often break loose , trailing a mane of flames to sweep across the sky
but with hera , though , he is not so outraged , so irate — it 's always your way to thwart his will , whatever zeus commands
bandy-legged he was , with one foot clubbed , both shoulders humped together , curving over his caved-in chest , and bobbing above them his skull warped to a point , sprouting clumps of scraggly , woolly hair
but the son of cronus throned on high knows nothing , nor does any other immortal housed on olympus shrouded deep in snow
he begged them all , groveling in the filth , crying out to them , calling each man by name , let go , my friends !
in this cup the woman skilled as a goddess mixed them a strong drink with pramnian wine , over it shredded goat cheese with a bronze grater and scattered barley into it , glistening pure white , then invited them to drink when she had mulled it all
nevertheless , i will still troop with the horsemen , give them maneuvers , discipline and commands : that is the right and pride of us old men
struck by the sudden sight , aeneas , all unknowing , wonders aloud , and asks : what is the river over there ?
you have paid your debt to our king and native land
hearing the king 's command the ranks pulled closer , tight as a mason packs a good stone wall , blocks on granite blocks for a storied house that fights the ripping winds — crammed so close the crested helmets , the war-shields bulging , jutting , buckler-to-buckler , helm-to-helm , man-to-man massed tight and the horsehair crests on glittering helmet horns brushed as they tossed their heads , the battalions bulked so dense
that city , my people , there ’ s the core and crux of this accursed war
here with a swoop the lovely goddess first took up her post , from the high ground looking round for arruns
running for dear life , legs driving , never a look behind
whom did i have to fear ?
others , look , he glimpses left and right in the meadows , feasting , singing in joy a chorus raised to healing apollo , deep in a redolent laurel grove where eridanus river rushes up , in full spate , and rolls through woods in the high world above
the old driver will slaughter you on the spot with a sharp bronze blade if you slack off now and we take a lesser prize
with all the power in me i have never quit , not from the time we rolled them back to troy
once they had reached the high seas , no land in sight , no longer—water at all points , at all points the sky— looming over their heads a pitch-dark thunderhead brought on night and storm , ruffling the swells black
he fired them so the armies roared and the ships resounded round them , shattering echoes ringing from their shouts as argives cried assent to king odysseus ' words
but then the trojans pinned the achaeans tight against their sterns , they gave them no way out , and the argive warlords begged my son to help , they named in full the troves of glittering gifts they would send his way
that very instant storming zeus dispatched apollo : go , my friend , to the side of hector armed in bronze
both gods knotted the rope of strife and leveling war , strangling both sides at once by stretching the mighty cable , never broken , never slipped , that snapped the knees of thousands
on a crest of olympus under golden clouds he sat , the god of war held fast by the will of zeus , aloof where the other deathless gods were kept back from battle
with that she loosed from her breasts the breastband , pierced and alluring , with every kind of enchantment woven through it
but now , while they debated their heated , divisive issues , sparring back and forth , aeneas struck camp and deployed his lines for battle
the armies looked on wonder-struck and marveled
that fool — he rewarded all his kindness with abuse , never gave him the mares he would come so far to win
it stood at the gates , huge , blunt at the base but spiked to a jagged point and no two men , the best in the whole realm , could easily prize it up from earth and onto a wagon , weak as men are now — but he quickly raised and shook it as zeus the son of cronus with cronus ' twisting ways made it a light lift for hector all on his own
pile it high with his arms— he left them hanging within our bridal chamber— the traitor , so devoted then !
while turnus fills his rutulian troops with headlong daring , allecto flies to the trojan camp on stygian wings— a fresh plot in the air—to scout out the place where handsome iulus was hunting along the shore , coursing , netting game
you know how my team outstrips all others ' speed
vesta and silver-haired good faith and romulus flanked by brother remus will make the laws
come , wheel round — stand firm !
zeus who marshals the storm cloud loves you both
the plan i still retain , and i have been forming , well , for a good long while now , from the very day that you , my illustrious king , infuriated achilles — you went and took from his tents the girl briseis , and not with any applause from us , far from it : i for one , i urged you against it , strenuously
you have it all , whatever your heart desires— dido ’ s ablaze with love , drawing the frenzy deep into her bones
as ares whipped the fighting spirit in each man sarpedon taunted hector : hector , where has it gone — that high courage you always carried in your heart ?
with that , just as dolon reached up for his chin to cling with a frantic hand and beg for life , diomedes struck him square across the neck — a flashing hack of the sword — both tendons snapped and the shrieking head went tumbling in the dust
but the two men kept their lookout , always alert to their comrades ' deaths or signs of instant flight as the two fought out on the flank — just as nestor ordered , sending both sons forth from the black ships to battle
then , at the same time , i am winging iris down to greathearted priam , commanding the king to ransom his dear son , to go to achaea 's ships , bearing gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
no homes , no city walls would give them shelter , nor would he have consented , fierce man that he was , no , a shepherd ’ s life on the lonely mountains , that ’ s the life he led
next those who held lacedaemon 's hollows deep with gorges , pharis , sparta and messe , crowded haunt of the wild doves , men who lived in brysiae and augeae 's gracious country , men who held amyclae , helos the seaboard fortress , men who settled laas and lived near oetylus : agamemnon 's brother , menelaus lord of the war cry led their sixty ships , armed them apart , downshore , and amidst their ranks he marched , ablaze with valor , priming men for attack
scylla lurks in her blind cave , thrusting out her mouths and hauling ships on her rocks
the king of lofty olympus countered briefly : if what you want is reprieve from instant death , some breathing space for the doomed young man , and you acknowledge the limits i lay down , then whisk your turnus away , pluck him out of the closing grip of fate
discipline fill your hearts !
may this day be one of joy for tyrians here and exiles come from troy , a day our sons will long remember
not i — i would not get too close to the son of cronus , much less put him under , not unless the father gave the command himself
but far fewer of them went down , remembering always to fight in tight formation , friend defending friend from headlong slaughter
achilles served the meat
two cups i ’ ll give you , struck in silver , ridged with engraving—father took them both when arisba fell—and a pair of tripods , two large bars of gold , and a winebowl full of years , dido of sidon ’ s gift
at once each captain shouted out commands to his driver : rein the team by the trench , good battle-order now !
if he returns , all griefs are gone !
but the glorious god of earthquakes shook in anger : what outrage !
you stay here on foot and guard the walls
not a man in sight will take that mission on , i fear , and go against our enemies , scout them out alone in the bracing godsent night — it will take a daring man to do the job
dardan fighters hand-to-hand , do not yield an inch , not in these bloody straits !
at once we will sacrifice twelve heifers in your shrine , yearlings never broken , if only you will pity troy , the trojan wives and all our helpless children !
exultant myrmidons took charge of the gifts and bore them off to their royal captain 's moorings
it is no disgrace for a king to appease a man when the king himself was first to give offense
a sight not lost on volcens , shouting out from the vanguard : soldiers , halt !
they will fight again tomorrow , until they win their way to the fixed doom of troy , since that is your only passion — you two goddesses — to plunder troy to rubble
then as the sun rolls round the giant arc of the year , icy winter arrives and a northwind roughens up the seas
reaching italy , he erected a city for his people , a trojan home called padua—gave them a trojan name , hung up their trojan arms and there , after long wars , he lingers on in serene and settled peace
see who takes the victory prize , the palm
i will bring it all to pass
he once sailed here for laomedon 's blooded horses , with just six ships and smaller crews than yours , true , but he razed the walls of troy , he widowed all her streets
nor was praeneste ’ s founder lacking from the ranks : king caeculus born to vulcan among the flocks , all ages still believe , and found on a burning hearth
book eighteen : the shield of achilles
they won this land for us with their own blood
undaunted , tydeus challenged them all to tests of strength and beat them all with ease , in each event , athena urged him on with so much winning force
it fell to earth and an argive snatched it up as it rolled at soldiers ' feet — and the night came blinding down deipyrus ' eyes
and they burned these on a cleft stick , peeled and dry , spitted the vitals , held them over hephaestus ' flames and once they would charred the thighs and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
no more delay , dodging each other down the passageways of battle !
double back on the sea-lanes , back to delos now , apollo ’ s oracle !
you , her father , have you no pity for your daughter , none for yourself ?
nothing — just shake with dread in the face of mighty hector
only one will be lost , one you ’ ll seek at sea
so apollo approached like butes head to foot—the man ’ s age , his voice , the shade of his skin , white hair , weapons clanging grimly , and counsels iulus now in his full glow of triumph : son of aeneas , stop !
aeneas never stoops to leveling men who show their backs or makes for the ones who fight him fairly , toe-to-toe , or the ones who fling their spears at longer range
her frightened comrades hurry to brace their falling queen but arruns races off , more frantic than all the rest— his triumph mixed with terror—no longer trusting his spear or daring to meet the young girl ’ s weapons point-blank
diomedes plowed on and after him came the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , following in their wake the great and little ajax armed in fury , idomeneus after them and idomeneus ' good aide , meriones , a match for the butcher god of war , eurypylus after them , euaemon 's gallant son , and teucer came up ninth , tensing his reflex bow and lurking under the wall of giant ajax ' shield
the madman , trying to match the storm and matchless lightning just by stamping on bronze with prancing horn-hoofed steeds !
and zeus in all his wisdom heard that prayer and straightaway the father launched an eagle — truest of zeus 's signs that fly the skies — the dark marauder that mankind calls the black-wing
i will take his lead , you will see
we have no lack of a handsome feast , i see that , either in agamemnon 's tents , the son of atreus , or here and now , in yours
telamonian ajax first , ajax brought down hyrtius , gyrtius ' son , a lord of the ironhearted mysians
all hands snap to orders , hiding swords away in the tall grasses , covering shields as well
but on he comes , pyrrhus with all his father ’ s force , no bolts , not even the guards can hold him back— under the ram ’ s repeated blows the doors cave in , the doorposts , prised from their sockets , crash flat
nothing can hold him back , this hector in all his fury — nothing , i tell you — not till he leaps behind achilles ' long-maned team and kills us both and routs our forward line — or he goes down himself in the first assault
once they had burned the bones and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
glaucus did not turn back or shun that call — on they charged , leading the lycians ' main mass
but larger than life , the life i ’ d known so well
first of the teams she gave you honey-hearted wheat , she even mixed it with wine for you to drink when the spirit moved her — before she would serve me , though i am proud to say i am her loving husband
quick , take up the whip and glittering reins !
now go and offer yourself to thankless dangers , you , you laughingstock !
and he rose up tall and challenged all the argives : atrides — achaeans-at-arms !
the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs are about to crush the men of troy
or exhausted , sink down to rest ?
i say no wealth is worth my life !
he offended athena and hera — both goddesses
roaming the woods , a quiver slung from her belt , wearing a spotted lynx-skin , or in full cry , hot on the track of some great frothing boar ?
yes , the will of the gods , that drives me through the shadows now , these moldering places so forlorn , this deep unfathomed night— their decrees have forced me on
the third day rose , driving the night ’ s chill from the sky as the mourners raked the embers , leveling off the ashes mixed with bones , and piled the gravesite high with mounds of earth still warm
there is a river , the minyeos emptying into the sea beside arene 's walls , and there we waited for goddess dawn to rise , the pylian horse in lines while squads of infantry came streaming up behind
go now , call ajax , idomeneus , quickly , make a run for it down along the ships
here i lie , here laid out for death
but here 's the best thing yet he 's done for the men — he 's put a stop to this babbling , foulmouthed fool !
they still have a way to go out there , those racing teams
see it through , this duty you ’ ve undertaken
look what a strong support the son of cronus speeds from ida to take your side and shield you — i am phoebus apollo , lord of the golden sword !
turnus in all his fury— that ’ s what the ruthless will of jove demands— abandons his hilltop ambush , quits the shaggy grove
pirous son of imbrasus winged it hard and true , the thracian chief who had sailed across from aenus
suddenly pallas runs rhoeteus through as he races past in his two-horse chariot
but they will never go for nothing , the oaths , the blood of the lambs , the unmixed wine we poured , the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted
then idomeneus ' good aide meriones came in fourth , trailing the famed atrides by a spear-throw
the crowd ’ s abuzz as he hauls himself to his feet , the one man who could trade blows with paris , dares who , by the mound where great hector lies , crushed the champion butes , that gigantic hulk , a braggart who fought as amycus ’ bebrycian kin— he laid him out on the yellow sand to gasp his last
let one of the leading captains take command
you really believe the enemy ’ s sailed away ?
priam takes command , has him freed from the ropes and chains that bind him fast , and hails him warmly : whoever you are , from now on , now you ’ ve lost the greeks , put them out of your mind and you ’ ll be one of us
within her single wall she will gird her seven hills , blest in her breed of men : like the berecynthian mother crowned with her turrets , riding her victor ’ s chariot through the phrygian cities , glad in her brood of gods , embracing a hundred grandsons
straight through the pelian ash burst , the shield rang out with a screech — but aeneas crouched low , holding the buckler off his chest , terrified as the shaft shot past his back , hurled so hard it plunged deep in the ground , even after it tore up two round plies of the shield that cased his body
the rest of the youngsters ride sicilian horses , old acestes ’ gifts , the riders awed by applause the dardans give their fine dressage , delighted to see in their looks their own lost parents ’ faces
and now the sunlight would have set upon their tears if achilles had not turned to agamemnon quickly : atrides — you are the first the armies will obey
and diomedes lord of the war cry stepped forward , here is your man
my mind is torn , i am harried back and forth , the heart inside me pounding through my chest and the sturdy legs beneath me giving way
you leave me a widow , lost in the royal halls — and the boy only a baby , the son we bore together , you and i so doomed
four he kept for himself , to rear in his own stalls , but the two you see in action he gave aeneas , both of them driving terrors
now aeneas , his ranking chiefs and handsome iulus stretch out on the grass below the boughs of a tall tree , then set about their meal , spreading a feast on wheaten cakes— jove himself impelled them—heaping the plates with ceres ’ gifts , her country fruits
his knees went limp , a man who would marched from paeonia , good fertile soil where he excelled all fighters , all but asteropaeus — down to the ground he went but battling asteropaeus pitied his comrade 's pain and charged the argives hard , mad to fight it out — no use , too late
they are mauling each other now , achaeans struggling to save the corpse from harm , trojans charging to haul it back to windy troy
but now venus , her anguish mounting , goes to neptune , pouring out her heart in a flood of lamentation : juno—her lethal rage , her insatiable spirit , neptune , makes me stoop to every kind of prayer
or else you would never see me now , alone on a windswept throne enduring right and wrong
an uphill battle it is , trading blows with the wives of zeus who rules the clouds
the deadly archer — aeneas knew him at once , looking straight in his eyes and the fighter loosed a rousing shout at hector : hector — all you captains of trojans , trojan allies — shame , what shame !
cutting and running so — take care that no one spears you in the back !
so you knew nothing at all from zeus about my death — and yet how sure you were !
every man of you mass with one resolve !
unlucky ufens died before he could see my shame and the trojans commandeered his corpse and weapons
even we have gods who battle on our side
that was never tydeus ' way , shy behind the lines — he would grapple enemies , bolting ahead of comrades
here a youngster breaks from the front— and an arrow whizzes in and down he goes , almo , the eldest son of tyrrhus—the point lodges deep in his throat and chokes off the moist path for his voice and his faint life breath with blood
and look , you see how handsome and powerful i am ?
i must not go and implore him
steal away in silence from my shores ?
oh , let no graver news arrive and pierce my ears !
then atreus ' son agamemnon stood in behalf of all , lifted his arms and prayed in his deep resounding voice , father zeus !
no , no , it 's not that we lack the skill in battle , it 's just the brutal lash of zeus that beats us down
but zeus saved me then , put force in my heart , spring in my racing knees
i will slip right into enemy lines at once — these trojans , camped at our flank
but wait — what am i saying ?
is this my binding pledge ?
the same people attack us both in savage war , rutulians under turnus , and if they drive us out , nothing , they do believe , can stop their forcing all of italy , all lands of the west beneath their yoke , the masters of every seaboard north and south
but if you are an immortal come from the blue , i am not the man to fight the gods of heaven
her shield of lightning dazzling , swirling around her , headlong on athena swept through the argive armies , driving soldiers harder , lashing the fighting-fury in each achaean 's heart — no stopping them now , mad for war and struggle
then on the peak of eryx reaching for the stars , he founds a temple to venus of mount ida , round it a spreading sacred grove , and appoints a priest to tend anchises ’ tomb
he fell hushed at last , his tale complete , at rest
but next achilles , burning to cut down asteropaeus hurled his ashen shaft — it flew straight as a die but a clean miss — it struck the river 's high bank and half the length of the lance stuck deep in soil
no longer would they make good the gifts , those troves of gifts to warm his heart , and even so he beat off that disaster
aeneas — dearest to me of all the men alive
but answer my questions
better that way — it 's tighter , stronger fighting
then you would have real delay in ransoming the body
about to swim for it , metabus stops short , stayed by love for his child , fear for that dear burden
but i will fill your legs and hearts with strength so you can save automedon , bear him from the fighting back to the fleet
like helpless birds , terrorized by the war that ruthless invader brings you , devastating your shores by force of arms
first he fastens under his feet the golden sandals , winged to sweep him over the waves and earth alike with the rush of gusting winds
i don ’ t flinch from a wreck in such a mooring once i ’ ve seized the land !
so athena vaunted and white-armed hera smiled but the mighty god of earthquakes challenged phoebus : apollo — why hold back from each other ?
a sharp tremor and the massive god of earthquakes left achaea 's lines , into the surf he dove and heroes missed him sorely
next odysseus led his cephallenian companies , gallant-hearted fighters , the island men of ithaca , of mount neriton 's leafy ridges shimmering in the wind , and men who lived in crocylia and rugged aegilips , men who held zacynthus and men who dwelled near samos and mainland men who grazed their flocks across the channel
it 's too soon to see agamemnon 's purpose clearly
the watchword ’ s out for war
now down in the ocean sank the fiery light of day , drawing the dark night across the grain-giving earth
down the trojans came like a squall of brawling gale-winds blasting down with the father 's thunder , loosed on earth and a superhuman uproar bursts as they pound the heavy seas , the giant breakers seething , battle lines of them roaring , shoulders rearing , exploding foam , waves in the vanguard , waves rolling in from the rear
at once they rush to the walls from all parts of the city
holding close to the wall , they picked their way until they reached the brave menestheus ' bastion
and he puts the winds to sleep , drifting on and on until he has shrouded over the mountains ' looming peaks and the headlands jutting sharp , the lowlands deep in grass and the rich plowed work of farming men , and the drifts fall on the gray salt surf and the harbors and down along the beaches and only breakers beating against the drifts can hold them off but all else on the earth they cover over , snows from the sky when zeus comes storming down — now so thick-and-fast they volleyed rocks from both sides , some at the trojans , some from trojans against the argives , salvos landing , the whole long rampart thundering under blows
but rouse this fellow , wo not you ?
pity us , god-fearing men !
automedon fought as he rode , though grieving for his friend , swooping in with the team like a vulture after geese
what are you plotting ?
consider it closely , achilles
welcome words , and soon as father neptune had soothed the goddess ’ heart , he harnesses up his team with their yoke of gold , slips the frothing bits in their chafing jaws , slacks the reins and the team goes running free , the sea-blue chariot skimming lightly over the crests and the waves fall calm , and under the axle ’ s thunder the sea swell levels off and the stormclouds flee from the wild skies
now a tower reared high , a commanding , salient point with rampways climbing up to it
i swear by the unappeasable fountainhead of the styx , the one dread oath decreed for the gods on high
right behind them the two aeantes held the trojans off as a wooded rocky ridge stretched out across an entire plain holds back a flood , fighting off the killer-tides of the mounting rivers , beating them all back to swamp the lowland flats — none of their pounding waves can make a breakthrough
abandon him here in troy to wallow in all his prizes — he will see if the likes of us have propped him up or not
i would not give you a splinter for that man !
never — others will take my side and do me honor , zeus above all , whose wisdom rules the world
so aeneas , with all eyes fixed on him alone , the founder of his people recalled his wanderings now , the fates the gods had sent
his brother alcanor runs to brace his falling brother , quick , but the spear ’ s already flown its bloody way , stabbing his dying arm that hangs from his shoulder , dangling loose by the tendons
your pleading repels me now
but hector kept on driving too — just at the point where he first broke through the gates and wall he charged , he smashed the achaean lines , dense with armed men , there where protesilaus ' and giant ajax ' ships lay hauled up in the breaking , churning surf and the wall to landward dipped low to the ground , the weakest point where the fiercest fighting raged — waves of trojans , trojan horse in assault
what god drove you to italy ?
seeing it grieving , he begins : long have we lived together , rhaebus , if anything in this mortal world lives long
breach the achaean rampart !
for they say hippolytus , once his stepmother ’ s craft had laid him low and he ’ d paid the price his father set in blood and his horses went berserk and tore the man apart , back he came , under the world of stars and windy sky , reborn by the healer ’ s potent herbs and diana ’ s love
and here it is , when the fathers ’ will is set on all-out war , the consul himself , decked out in romulus ’ garb , his toga girt up in the ceremonial gabine way , will unbar the screeching gates and cry for war
but the welcome he gave aeneas costs him dear
piercing loud as the trumpet 's battle cry that blasts from murderous raiding armies ringed around some city — so piercing now the cry that broke from aeacides
achilles never dreamed patroclus would storm all troy without him , not even with him
up and down the decks of the ships he went with his great plunging strides , swinging in hand his enormous polished pike for fights at sea , clamped with clinchers , twenty-two forearms long
you too , ufens , nersae ’ s foothills sent you to war with your glowing fame , your brilliant luck in arms and your aequian clans , most rugged men alive , seasoned to rough hunting in thicket groves on their hardscrabble land
the great victor , driving those huge bulls down to pasture , herds crowding these riverbanks and glens
will they abandon the city heights with this man fallen ?
i have no desire to rise from a bed like that and steal back home to your own high halls — think of the shocking scandal there would be !
now time wears on , day in , day out , and the breezes lure our sails , a southwind rippling in our canvas
but the cretan captain burst back in answer , ajax , champion wrangler in all the ranks !
ismarus , you too , your fine hardy fighters watched you dipping your arrowheads in poison , winging wounds at the enemy
but hector rebuked him now , shouting out his name : melanippus — how can we take things lying down this way ?
next in the march come twin brothers , leaving tibur ’ s walls and people named for their brother ’ s name , tiburtus— catillus and fearless coras , boys from argos
i will hold out till the sun goes down — enduring — fasting — despite your appeals
his heavy sweating , his hard breathing stopped the moment the will of storming zeus revived him
trojan and tuscan allies pouring down from the tiber , sweeping the whole plain !
that very moment , vengeful tisiphone , armed with lashes , springs on the guilty , whips them till they quail , with her left hand shaking all her twisting serpents , summoning up her savage sisters , bands of furies
he cheated me , did me damage , wrong !
backing into his friendly ranks , he cringed from death as one who trips on a snake in a hilltop hollow recoils , suddenly , trembling grips his knees and pallor takes his cheeks and back he shrinks
take what i say to heart and stamp it in your minds : this prophecy the almighty father made to phoebus and phoebus made to me , the greatest of the furies , and i reveal to you
revere great juno ’ s power first in all your prayers , to juno chant your vows with a full heart and win the mighty goddess over with gifts to match your vows
now as the dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth zeus who loves the lightning summoned all the gods to assembly on the topmost peak of ridged olympus
hurl the enemy from the borders !
so he proposed and down he sat again as calchas rose among them , thestor 's son , the clearest by far of all the seers who scan the flight of birds
but just as we were parceling out the plunder and offering victims to the gods around the city , right on the third day they came , the epeans massed in a swarm of men and plunging battle-stallions struck at the border , full force — and square in their midst the two moliones armed to the hilt , and still boys , not quite masters yet in the ways of combat
for the third he produced a fine four-measure cauldron never scorched by flames , its sheen as bright as new
now is your time to glory to the skies
so even in death 's strong house there is something left , a ghost , a phantom — true , but no real breath of life
and the old and noble priam answered slowly , if you truly want me to give prince hector burial , full , royal honors , you would show me a great kindness , achilles , if you would do exactly as i say
when could we find a breathing space from fasting ?
never once did my altar lack its share of victims , winecups tipped and the deep smoky savor
he answered her questions , drawing a labored sigh from deep within his chest : goddess , if i ’ d retrace our story to its start , if you had time to hear the saga of our ordeals , before i finished the evening star would close the gates of olympus , put the day to sleep
struck , the italians shout out , saluting that great omen , all hands eager to take up arms , and the augur tolumnius urges first : this , this , he cries , is the answer to all my prayers !
i can recall , though the years have blurred the tale , that auruncan elders liked to tell how dardanus sprang up in these fields , then wandered east to the towns of phrygian ida , thracian samos , called samothrace these days
i never dreamed i ’ d keep my flight a secret
we will set all this to rights , someday , if zeus will ever let us raise the winebowl of freedom high in our halls , high to the gods of cloud and sky who live forever — once we drive these argives geared for battle out of troy !
not that i blame you , trojans , nor our pacts , our friendship sealed by a handclasp
linger on for the feasts and cups at the groaning board— that ’ s your love , your lust— till the seer will bless and proclaim the sacrifice and the rich victim lures you into the deep groves !
but apollo ’ s seer broke in and countered charon : there ’ s no such treachery here—just calm down— no threat of force in our weapons
we tossed her some beach to plow—on my terms— and then she spurns our offer of marriage , she embraces aeneas as lord and master in her realm
his mother , the goddess , she ’ ll be far from his side with her woman ’ s wiles , lurking in stealthy shadows , hiding him in clouds when her hero cuts and runs !
over and over the helmet casing his hollow temples rings out shrill , the solid bronze of it splits wide open under the rocks , the plumes are ripped from his head , the boss of his shield caves in to the hammering blows
three blustery winter nights the southwind bore me wildly over the endless waters , then at the fourth dawn , swept up on a breaker ’ s crest , i could almost sight it now—italy !
book twenty-one : achilles fights the river
still he mocked her with wicked lies , with empty hopes
armies of allies crowd the mighty city of priam , true , but they speak a thousand different tongues , fighters gathered here from all ends of the realm
the husband to whom my father and noble mother gave me , i saw him torn by the sharp bronze before our city , and my three brothers — a single mother bore us : my brothers , how i loved you !
anguish for all that armor — sweep it from your mind
do — they are your team , they will haul your curving chariot so much better under the driver they know best if we have to beat retreat from diomedes
from this gold goblet father anchises tipped the wine at the high altars
everywhere round the wall the surging inhuman blaze of war leapt up the rocks — the argives , desperate , had no choice , they struggled now to defend the ships , and the gods were cast down in spirit , all who had urged the argive soldiers on in battle
you ’ ve made me see my son ’ s death with my own eyes , defiled a father ’ s sight with a son ’ s lifeblood
like him to the life , the racing iris urged , old priam , words , endless words — that is your passion , always , as once in the days of peace
my comrade 's death has cut me to the quick
yielding is far better
if only you—you have the power—would bend your will to a better goal !
then with a groan he called his dear friend by name : feel no anger at me , patroclus , if you learn — even there in the house of death — i let his father have prince hector back
you wo not last long , i would say — now the glory 's mine !
but the sibyl , still not broken in by apollo , storms with a wild fury through her cave
zeus has accomplished everything you wanted , just as you raised your hands and prayed that day
let him bow down to me !
the archer leaning firmly against a pillar raised on the man-made tomb of dardan 's son , ilus an old lord of the realm in ancient days
no coward 's work , to save your exhausted friends from headlong death
she ceased and the god of fire quenched his grim inhuman blaze and back in its channel ran the river 's glistening tides
now fighting men will sicken of battle quickly : the more dead husks the bronze strews on the ground the sparser the harvest then , when zeus almighty tips his scales and the tide of battle turns — the great steward on high who rules our mortal wars
do not seize the girl , agamemnon , powerful as you are — leave her , just as the sons of achaea gave her , his prize from the very first
then juno in all her power , filled with pity for dido ’ s agonizing death , her labor long and hard , sped iris down from olympus to release her spirit wrestling now in a deathlock with her limbs
and the lord of the battle cry could not refuse but dragged his heels like a lion leaving sheepfolds , bone-weary from harrying hounds and field hands
but now i will hasten back
if such a glorious destiny can not fire his spirit , if he will not shoulder the task for his own fame , does the father of ascanius grudge his son the walls of rome ?
here ritual said that kings should receive the scepter , first raise the rods of power
but now menelaus rose , his heart smoldering , still holding a stubborn grudge against antilochus
and the men who held euboea , abantes breathing fury , chalcis and eretria , histiaea covered with vineyards , cerinthus along the shore and dion 's hilltop streets , the men who held carystus and men who settled styra
much as your heart would spur you on to war
but then she saw great zeus at rest on the ridge and the craggy heights of ida gushing cold springs and her heart filled with loathing
come , stand in front of your team and chariot , grasp the coiling whip that lashed them home , lay your hand on their manes and swear by the mighty god who grips and shakes the earth you never blocked my chariot — not by deliberate foul
but even to us , at last , time brought the answer to our prayers : the help , the arrival of a god
but there was a crowd of kin and cousins round me , holding me in the house , begging me to stay
i took him on and athena gave me glory
there once was a cavern here , a vast unplumbed recess untouched by the sun ’ s rays , where a hideous , part-human monster made his home— cacus
he led the men who lived in opois , cynus , calliarus , bessa and scarphe , the delightful town of augeae , tarphe and thronion down the boagrius river
his tears , his treachery seized the men whom neither tydeus ’ son nor achilles could defeat , nor ten long years of war , nor all the thousand ships
but her eyes widening , noble hera answered , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
will your warlust always lie in your windy words and your craven , racing feet ?
i no longer beg for the long-lost marriage he betrayed , nor would i ask him now to desert his kingdom , no , his lovely passion , latium
his are the best horses i ever saw , the biggest , whiter than snow , and speed to match the wind !
or plunge in the heavy swells and swim back to the bay and pitch himself at the trojan spears once more ?
zeus willing a trojan victory , hector 's victory , lifting the famous runner achilles ' glory higher , but he had no lust to destroy the whole argive force before the walls of troy — all the father wanted was glory for thetis and thetis ' strong-willed son
and here i am , no chariot , no team to speed me on
and next , catching sight of the trojan ’ s clothes and the bed they knew by heart , delaying a moment for tears , for memory ’ s sake , the queen lay down and spoke her final words : oh , dear relics , dear as long as fate and the gods allowed , receive my spirit and set me free of pain
but now , if you are gearing up for war , your mind set , whatever my pains and all my skills can promise , whatever molten electrum and iron can bring to life , whatever the bellows ’ fiery blasts can do—enough !
tonight 's the night that rips our ranks to shreds or pulls us through
that said , he orders back the food and cups already cleared away , and the king himself conducts his guests to places on the grass
so it must please his overweening heart , who knows ?
from italy comes no barrier posed against the towns of tyre
trusty friends conducted dares back to the ships , dragging his wobbly knees , his head lolling side to side , spitting clots from his mouth , blood mixed with teeth
the two powerful sons of cronus , zeus and poseidon , their deathless spirits warring against each other , were building mortal pains for seasoned heroes
how long we waited for you , here on laurentine soil and latian fields
thrasymedes staunch in combat handed tydeus ' son a two-edged sword — he would left his own at the ship — a shield too , and over his head he set a helmet , bull's-hide , bare of ridge and crest , a skullcap , so it 's called , and made to protect the heads of tough young-blooded fighters
apollo has never lied before
just look at this reckless diomedes now — athena spurred him on to rave against the gods
heart-weary as we are !
a man on fire , he seizes a blazing pine-tar torch in his fist and now , watch , his men pitch into the work as turnus urges them on in person and whole battalions equip themselves with smoking brands
so he cried and his own bronze helmet flashed as hector veered away from the heavy fighting , running after his men and caught them quickly
look at the endless miles that lie between us
ah , how often i watched him battling on the lines where men win glory , saw the man with my own eyes !
all shipmates snap to commands , glad to do his orders
the lord of the war cry nodded , yes , fine , but what orders for me ?
each one killed his man
idomeneus wrenched his dark shaft from the corpse but as for the dead man 's burnished gear — no use
but now i will go and meet that murderer head-on , that hector who destroyed the dearest life i know
turnus , finishing up with a stroke between the helmet ’ s base and the breastplate ’ s upper rim , hacked off his head and left his trunk in the sand
never bury my bones apart from yours , achilles , let them lie together
many things the run of the days and shifting works of fickle time have turned from bad to good
stab me through , if you have any decency left , whip all your lances into me , you rutulians , kill me first with steel !
the first by far , eumelus lord of men sprang up , admetus ' prized son who excelled in horsemanship and following him tydides , powerful diomedes , yoking the breed of tros he would wrested from aeneas just the other day when apollo saved their master
as soon as her fury dies and raving lips fall still , the hero aeneas launches in : no trials , my lady , can loom before me in any new , surprising form
but trojans , thrilled at the sound of zeus 's thunder , pitched themselves at the argives still more fiercely , summoning up their fiery lust for battle
entellus towers up for a stunning roundhouse right and dares seeing it coming , ducks , quick , he ’ s gone— but the giant ’ s full force poured in the crashing blow lands on empty air and his own weight brings him down , a colossal man , a colossal fall , he slammed the earth , toppled , as often a hollow pine , ripped up by the roots on steep mount ida or erymanthus , topples down to ground
by chance he was counting over his own people , all his cherished heirs , their fame and their fates , their values , acts of valor
he fell with a crash , armor ringing against his ribs , his locks like the graces ' locks splashed with blood , still braided tight with gold and silver clips , pinched in like a wasp 's waist
but they called him the son of borus , perieres ' son who showered the girl with countless bridal gifts , his wedded bride in the sight of all the world
as he racked his brains , desperate , deeply torn , he lit on a quick decision
they would not gone far and he ran with eager strides as they bore achilles ' famous arms toward troy
the roads resounded with joy , revelry , clapping hands , with bands of matrons in every temple , altars in each and the ground before them strewn with slaughtered steers
he summons mnestheus , sergestus , staunch serestus , chosen captains , takes his stand on a high rise where the rest of the trojan fighters cluster round , tight ranks that don ’ t throw down their shields and spears as aeneas , rising amidst them , urges from the earthwork : no delay in obeying my orders—jove backs us now !
— patroclus , master horseman — not till you have slashed the shirt around his chest and soaked it red in the blood of man-killing hector !
rising among them chryses stretched his arms to the sky and prayed in a high resounding voice , hear me , apollo !
here , come closer — trying to frighten argives ?
but the red-haired menelaus tried to calm him : courage
do as you please — but none of the deathless gods will ever praise you
if only the storm that drove you drove your king and aeneas were here now !
now , by jove ’ s command he lands on rutulian soil , so now i do come , kneeling before the godhead i adore , begging weapons for my aeneas , a mother for her son !
i see two men and they are bearing down to fight you !
— as his mind swarms with journeys , fresh desires — so quick in her eager flight flew noble hera now and scaling steep olympus went among the gods , the immortal powers thronging zeus 's halls
odysseus knew the end had not yet come — no final , fatal wound — and drawing back he hurled his boast at socus : poor man , headlong death is about to overtake you !
like dido now , striding triumphant among her people , spurring on the work of their kingdom still to come
what plans are they mapping , what maneuvers next ?
and now the volscians charge , ranks of them packing under a tortoise-shell of shields , bent on filling the trenches , tearing down stockades
priam forbade his people to wail aloud
her gray eyes clear , the goddess athena answered , down from the skies i come to check your rage if only you will yield
there in the brush and the rough lairs of beasts he nursed his child on raw milk from the dugs of a wild brood-mare , milking its udders into her tender lips
if only i ’ d paid in full with my own guilty life , by any death on earth !
fierce young girl , who is the first and who the last your spear cuts down ?
gear up with the best and biggest shields in camp and encase our heads in helmets , burnished , fire-bright and take in hand the longest javelins we can find — then in for attack !
beside them were those condemned to die on a false charge
no doom my noble mother revealed to me from zeus , just this terrible pain that wounds me to the quick — when one man attempts to plunder a man his equal , to commandeer a prize , exulting so in his own power
then you are happy enough to down the roast meats and cups of honeyed , mellow wine — all you can drink
so now i come , i throw myself at your knees , please help me !
he would better aim his terrible salvos at his own , all his sons and daughters
with that he wrenched his bronze spear from the corpse , laid it aside and ripped the bloody armor off the back
and those who held arcadia under cyllene 's peak , near aepytus ' ancient tomb where men fight hand-to-hand , men who lived in pheneos and orchomenos rife with sheep , stratia , rhipe and enispe whipped by the sudden winds , men who settled tegea , mantinea 's inviting country , men who held stymphalus , men who ruled parrhasia — the son of ancaeus led them , powerful agapenor with sixty ships in all , and aboard each vessel crowded full arcadian companies skilled in war
and any trojan crashing against the beaked ships , torch ablaze in hand , straining to please hector who urged him on
straight through enemy columns i go plowing now — and no trojan , i guarantee , will thrill with pleasure once he meets my spearshaft head-to-head !
mother hera — look , these long-haired achaeans must be sprung of your own immortal loins
i will go after nestor , wake and rouse him , see if the good man wants to join the guard , that strong contingent , and give them orders
as his spirit churned , at last one plan seemed best : he would send a murderous dream to agamemnon
at one glance hector raked his brother with insults , stinging taunts : paris , appalling paris !
priam , son of laomedon , bound for salamis , out to visit his sister hesione ’ s kingdom , continued on to see arcadia ’ s cold frontiers
i won ’ t miss a single rutulian with my spear , just as my spears impaled the greeks at troy !
yet first the handsome iulus—beyond his years , filled with a man ’ s courage , a man ’ s concerns as well— gives them many messages to carry to his father
but i could stop that wretched couple 's pain if only i brought your head and bloody armor home and laid them in panthous ' arms , in lovely phrontis ' arms !
let them rot , the one or two who hatch their plans apart from all the troops — what good can they win from that ?
and the trojan ranks , with lightning-bolt mnestheus out in the lead , unleash an immense barrage of spears , and sweat goes rippling over turnus ’ entire body , rivering down , black with filth— can ’ t catch his breath , gasping , weak knees quaking , bone-tired until at last he dives headfirst , plunging into the river , armor and all , and tiber swept him into its yellow tide , catching him as he came , then bore him up in its soothing waves and bathing away the carnage , gave the elated fighter back to friends
god of the silver bow who strides the walls of chryse and cilla sacrosanct — lord in power of tenedos !
but at this , salius bursts out with howls that ring through the huge arena , round from the front-row elders to the crowd—a foul had robbed him clean of the prize he wanted back
nothing can stop them now — that 's their boast — they will hurl themselves against our blackened hulls
i left you alive that day i left these shelters , now i come back to find you fallen , captain of armies !
who 's that wounded man he 's bringing in from the fighting ?
but the veteran fighter lay there fast asleep , the cured hide of a field ox spread beneath him , a lustrous blanket stretched beneath his head
an archer 's hit him , a good hand at the bow , some trojan or some lycian — all glory to him , a heavy blow to us
not even his own son !
but soon this recourse struck his mind as best : he would go and approach the son of neleus first and see if nestor could work out something with him , some foolproof plan that just might ward disaster off the achaean forces
but the red-haired captain flared back in anger : father zeus — listen to this indecent , reckless bluster !
how can you say i hang back from the fighting when argive units spur the slashing god of war against these trojan horsemen ?
but achilles rounded on agamemnon once again , lashing out at him , not relaxing his anger for a moment : staggering drunk , with your dog 's eyes , your fawn 's heart !
i will burn their ships , i will slaughter all their men , argive heroes panicked in smoke along their hulls !
no captive slave allotted to serve the lust of a conquering hero ’ s bed !
now for a spear — we will see if this can kill you !
and what if it 's all true and the man 's to blame — lord of the far-flung kingdoms , hero agamemnon — because he spurned the famous runner achilles ?
our blood enemies camp hard by
do not let them bear patroclus ' body back to their ships without a fight !
oh they would leap for joy to hear the two of you battling on this way , you who excel us all , first in achaean councils , first in the ways of war
down the goddess swept from olympus ' craggy peaks and dove like a star the son of cronus flings , cronus with all his turning , twisting ways — a sign to men at sea or a massive army marching , blazing on with a stream of sparks showering in its wake
never rest your hands from the great leveler war , not till you pack and cram the trojan armies tight in the famous walls of troy — whoever flees your onset
and seizing magus ’ helmet tight in his left hand and wrenching back his neck as the man prays on , he digs his sword-blade deep down to the hilt
i myself hold out on shore with the beached ships here but i send my comrade forth to war with troops of myrmidons — launch glory along with him , high lord of thunder , zeus !
and no one will heap contempt on what i say , not even mighty agamemnon
and so he kept on raging , shaming noble hector , but the gods in bliss looked down and pitied priam 's son
now i see them straggling , lost , i hear them groaning as they go under
what brave young men !
he vowed to me long ago , he bowed his head that i should never embark for home till i had brought the walls of ilium crashing down
they tore at the towers ' outworks , pulled at battlements , heaving , trying to pry loose with levers the buttress stakes achaeans first drove in the earth to shore the rampart up — they struggled to root these out , hoping to break down the achaean wall itself
from clausus spreads through latium both the claudian tribe and clan , once rome had long been shared with sabine people
your prophets dwelling round you , zeus , the selli sleeping along the ground with unwashed feet
zeus the father who marshals ranks of storm clouds gave commands , leap to it then
the crime ’ s all mine , he never dared , could never do it !
then a mixed cordon of boys and mothers rings the walls as the long last struggle calls them all to gather
even her father , pluto , loathes the monster , even her own infernal sisters loathe her since she shifts into so many forms , their shapes so fierce , the black snakes of her hair that coil so thickly
then on the tenth the gods of heaven interred them
but zeus drove a swirl of panic deep in their lines and down from the vaulting skies released a shower raining blood , for zeus was bent on hurling down to the house of death a rout of sturdy fighters
so arruns , shaken , slinking from sight , content with a bare escape , loses himself in the milling lines of fighters
come , with the first light of day , our spirits high , let ’ s explore the land
the moment he joins his comrades packed in ambush he prays to wade in carnage , cut-and-thrust at once
and the army gave consent
what sorrow has touched your heart ?
aeneas charging aphareus , son of caletor , slit open his throat just turning toward aeneas ' ripping blade — his head slumped to the side , shield crushing in on him , helmet too , and courage-shattering death engulfed his corpse
young gyas blazed in indignation deep to his bones , tears streamed down his cheeks , he flings to the winds all care for self-respect and the safety of his crew and pitches the sluggish menoetes off the stern , headlong into the sea and takes the helm himself
no enemy could ever go against him in arms and leave unscathed , whether he fought on foot or rode on horseback , digging spurs in his charger ’ s lathered flanks
and terror-struck in the underworld , hades lord of the dead cringed and sprang from his throne and screamed shrill , fearing the god who rocks the ground above his realm , giant poseidon , would burst the earth wide open now and lay bare to mortal men and immortal gods at last the houses of the dead — the dank , moldering horrors that fill the deathless gods themselves with loathing
but lausus ’ father was just stanching his wounds in the tiber ’ s waters , leaning his body against a tree trunk , resting now
overflowing with pride , glorying over his bull the old champion shouts : son of the goddess , see , you trojans too , what power i had when i was in my prime , and from what a death you rescue dares now !
if he kills you now , how can i ever mourn you on your deathbed ?
and you , famous maximus , you are the one man whose delaying tactics save our roman state
hard , ruthless man
but he showered tears of blood that drenched the earth , showers in praise of him , his own dear son , the man patroclus was just about to kill on troy 's fertile soil , far from his fatherland
he tells achates to fetch some gifts as well , plucked from the ruins of troy : a gown stiff with figures stitched in gold , and a woven veil with yellow sprays of acanthus round the border
so he wavered , waiting there , but achilles was closing on him now like the god of war , the fighter 's helmet flashing , over his right shoulder shaking the pelian ash spear , that terror , and the bronze around his body flared like a raging fire or the rising , blazing sun
but now diomedes thrusting over the giant 's massive shield , again and again , threatened to graze his throat — the spearpoint glinting sharp — and such terror for ajax struck his argive friends they cried for them to stop , to divide the prizes , share and share alike !
take this path to the queen ’ s gates
but look , suddenly , right before his awestruck eyes , a marvel , shining white through the woods with a brood as white , lying stretched out on a grassy bank for all to see— a great sow
the night watch too , it must be kept unbroken , so no night raiders can slip inside the walls with our armies camped afield
alone before the gates messapus and brave atinas hold our front lines steady , ringed by enemy squadrons packed tight , bristling a jagged crop of naked blades !
then some trojan will glory , swaggering , arrogant , leaping down on the grave of famous menelaus : 'let agamemnon wreak his anger so on all his foes !
here and there you can sight some sailors bobbing in heavy seas , strewn in the welter now the weapons , men , stray spars and treasures saved from troy
and spread the soothing , healing salves across it , the powerful drugs they say you learned from achilles and chiron the most humane of centaurs taught your friend
i never engaged in combat on such terms
but at last , goaded on by ulysses ’ mounting threats but in fact conniving in their plot , he breaks his silence and dooms me to the altar
today the goddess of birth pangs and labor will bring to light a human child , a man-child born of the stock of men who spring from my blood , one who will lord it over all who dwell around him
with such anger seething inside her fiery heart the goddess reached aeolia , breeding-ground of storms , their home swarming with raging gusts from the south
and there they were , gathered around priam , panthous and thymoetes , lampus and clytius , hicetaon the gray aide of ares , then those two with unfailing good sense , ucalegon and antenor
but hera knew it all
the whole grove covers it over , dusky valleys enfold it too , closing in around it
he swung the bellows aside and off the fires , gathered the tools he would used to weld the cauldrons and packed them all in a sturdy silver strongbox
no , my trojan guest , we have been saved from dangers , brutal perils , and so we observe these rites , we renew them year by year , and justly so
with the last words his feet sped him on
now — while the gifts still wait — go out and fight !
and nestor the noble charioteer assented gladly : true , when the man leaps in the breach that way no one can blame or disobey him , no achaean , not when he spurs the troops and gives commands
they would gone to the games , primed to race for the tripod , but augeas the warlord commandeered them on the spot and sent the driver packing , sick for his team
so he wonders , madly tugging the reins back and makes the chariot stop
but let this be my warning on your way : since apollo insists on taking my chryseis , i will send her back in my own ships with my crew
and i tell you this — take it to heart , i urge you — if you send sarpedon home , living still , beware !
the brave son of menoetius answered quickly , impossible
i tell you this , and so help me it 's the truth — he will soon pay for his arrogance with his life !
so go and call the argive warriors to the muster : renounce your rage at the proud commander agamemnon , then arm for battle quickly , don your fighting power !
on those terms he dragged his ruthless dagger across the lambs ' throats and let them fall to the ground , dying , gasping away their life breath , cut short by the sharp bronze
but queen hera summoned apollo from the halls and iris too , the messenger of the immortals , and gave them both their winged marching orders : zeus directs you to ida with all good speed !
i should have torched their camp and flooded their decks with fire
what if one of the men gets wind of your brave plan ?
the tragic queen of carthage but the queen—too long she has suffered the pain of love , hour by hour nursing the wound with her lifeblood , consumed by the fire buried in her heart
athena had swept away their senses
grief for your son will do no good at all
but i and our fast stallions will not race today , so strong his fame , the charioteer they have lost , so kind — always washing them down with fresh water , sleeking their long manes with smooth olive oil
ah my friend , if you and i could escape this fray and live forever , never a trace of age , immortal , i would never fight on the front lines again or command you to the field where men win fame
no gold band for her hair , no long flaring cape , a tiger-skin that covered her head hung down her back
i fear the man , i would die of shame to rob him — just think of the trouble i might suffer later
by now , early dawn had risen up from the saffron bed of tithonus , scattering fresh light on the world
so he launched athena already poised for action
but maia ’ s father—to trust what we have heard— is atlas , the same atlas who lifts the starry skies
next we run with the winds and leave selinus , city of palms , astern , then pick our way by the shoals and hidden spurs of lilybaeum
but about your question — yes , i have the answer
that is why no mortal can fight achilles head-to-head : at every foray one of the gods goes with him , beating back his death
so the red-haired captain bestrode patroclus now , shielding his corpse with spear and round buckler , burning to kill off any man who met him face-to-face
the gods looked grim throughout the halls of zeus
his strong fate was driving him now against sarpedon , a man like a god
god forbid they panic , skittish with fear , buck and never pull us out of the fighting , missing your own voice as tydeus ' son attacks — he will kill us both and drive them off as prizes
there hector struck , hurling the jagged rock at teucer drawing in fury — snapped the string and his hand went numb at the wrist , he dropped to a knee , dazed
now is the time for him to work , to hunt the leading captains and beg them all for help
she always feels alone , abandoned , always wandering down some endless road , not a friend in sight , seeking her own phoenicians in some godforsaken land
so the bronze flared on his chest as on he raced — and the old man moaned , flinging both hands high , beating his head and groaning deep he called , begging his dear son who stood before the gates , unshakable , furious to fight achilles to the death
seek out the town of corythus , sail for italy !
as soon as the shadows were dispersed and the light restored to his mind , he turned his fiery glance toward the ramparts , glaring back from his chariot to the town
and last they yoked his team to the king 's chariot , stallions he bred himself in his own polished stalls
the huge guard at the gates can howl for eternity from his cave , terrifying the bloodless shades , persephone keep her chastity safe at home behind her uncle ’ s doors
his mind in turmoil , this way seemed the best : he would head for atreus ' son
my father adamastus was poor , and so i sailed to troy— oh if only our poverty lasted longer !
and hector lunged again like a murderous lion mad for kills , charging cattle grazing across the flats of a broad marshy pasture , flocks by the hundred led by an unskilled herdsman helpless to keep the marauder off a longhorn heifer — no fighting that bloody slaughter — all he can do is keep pace with the lead or straggling heads , leaving the center free for the big cat 's pounce and it eats a heifer raw as the rest stampede away
to italy you will go
and father vulcan , enthralled by venus , his everlasting love , replied : why plumb the past for appeals ?
who are your people ?
our fate , i tell you , stands on a razor 's edge : life or death for achaea , gruesome death at that
the persuasion of a comrade has its powers
so now i meet my doom
each received his realm
they all roared with laughter at his expense
urging them on but torn : whom to lead to the shore assault ?
so all the more you can rejoice with me in italy , found at last
and the first to beat retreat , a boeotian , peneleos
you be more just to others , from now on
quickly he trained his reflex bow on diomedes charging straight ahead — he shot !
though his rich estates lie far away in the country , it wo not be want of iron that brings his shepherd or plowman into town — he will be well-stocked at home
as such fears went churning through his mind the warlord nestor 's son drew near him now , streaming warm tears , to give the dreaded message : ah son of royal peleus , what you must hear from me !
it was not trojan spearmen who brought me here to fight
how many sons of gods went down under troy ’ s high wall !
mixed with ausonian blood , one race will spring from them , and you will see them outstrip all men , outstrip all gods in reverence
yes , and here , carved in seasoned cedar , rows of statues , rows of the founding forebears : italus , father sabinus , the vintner ’ s figure still wielding his hooked knife ; old saturn and janus ’ figure facing right and left
a chaste sibyl will guide you there , once you have offered the blood of many pure black sheep
he could keep his feet no longer , knees caved in on the spot — as under the ruffling north wind a fish goes arching up and flops back down on a beach-break strewn with seaweed and a dark wave blacks him out
as the snake devoured the sparrow with her brood , eight and the mother made the ninth , she would borne them all , so we will fight in troy that many years and then , then in the tenth we will take her broad streets
so home we go in those ships and cut the seas again , since now such deadly anger strikes our captain
that promise lifts his anguish , drives , for a while , the grief from his sad heart
and there in the midst of milling thousands , chiefs paraded left and right , resplendent in all their purple-and-gold regalia : mnestheus , blood kin of assaracus , hardy asilas , then messapus , breaker of horses , neptune ’ s son
then ocean men from dulichion and the holy islands , the echinades rising over the sea across from elis — meges a match for ares led their troops to war , a son of the rider phyleus dear to zeus who once , enraged at his father , fled and settled dulichion
and father zeus will waste me with a hideous fate , and after i have lived to look on so much horror !
you are not to blame
ajax ' challenge — how could it please his courage still to hang back now where other achaeans held the rear ?
all on my own i ’ ll bring your temple yearly gifts !
hector — his loving wife and noble mother were first to fling themselves on the wagon rolling on , the first to tear their hair , embrace his head and a wailing throng of people milled around them
shaking fists , they shout to arms !
but the will of zeus will always overpower the will of men , zeus who strikes fear in even the bravest man of war and tears away his triumph , all in a lightning flash , and at other times he will spur a man to battle , just as he urged patroclus ' fury now
how long we ’ ve waited , hector , for you to come , and now from what far shores ?
laocoön deserved to pay for his outrage , so they say , he desecrated the sacred timbers of the horse , he hurled his wicked lance at the beast ’ s back
on the other flank , agrippa stands tall as he steers his ships in line , impelled by favoring winds and gods and from his forehead glitter the beaks of ships on the naval crown , proud ensign earned in war
but hermes the guide of souls and giant-killer reassured her mother , leto , nothing to fear , i would never fight you , leto
elephenor , comrade of ares , led the whole contingent , chalcodon 's son , a lord of the fierce abantes
his gifts , i loathe his gifts
once i have washed my sweat away in the river , yes , i just might make it back again to troy — but why debate , my friend , why thrash things out ?
juno had barely closed when tears brimmed in juturna ’ s eyes and three , four times over she beat her lovely breast
already a new achilles springs to life in latium , son of a goddess too !
great ajax now — forever aiming at hector , trying to strike his helmet flashing bronze but hector was far too seasoned , combat-tested , broad shoulders hunching under his bull's-hide shield , his eyes peeled for a whistling shaft or thudding spear
but you , my king , be on your guard yourself
he commands his men
but now , look , just slipped out from under the greek barrage of spears , panthus , othrys ’ son , a priest of apollo ’ s shrine on the citadel—hands full of the holy things , the images of our conquered gods—he ’ s dragging along his little grandson , making a wild dash for our doors
you will never set your eyes on the day of doom that topples looming troy
and he enters the great shaded river , overjoyed
trail the trojan ships , bend to the trojans ’ every last demand ?
his scraggly beard a tangled mat of white , his eyes fixed in a fiery stare , and his grimy rags hang down from his shoulders by a knot
then , with the first lull in the feast , the tables cleared away , they set out massive bowls and crown the wine with wreaths
you tell me to put my trust in birds , flying off on their long wild wings ?
his fine voice rising and falling low as the rest followed , all together , frisking , singing , shouting , their dancing footsteps beating out the time
oh no , you wo not get past me , take me in that way !
the heart inside you is always tempered hard , like an ax that goes through wood when a shipwright cuts out ship timbers with every ounce of skill and the blade 's weight drives the man 's stroke
we worship you first and foremost , honor your fires stoked by cords of pine !
fortune speeds the bold !
and then , when the first deep rest had driven sleep away and the chariot of night had wheeled past mid-career , that hour a housewife rises , faced with scratching out a living with loom and minerva ’ s homespun crafts , and rakes the ashes first to awake the sleeping fires , adding night to her working hours , and sets her women toiling on at the long day ’ s chores by torchlight— and all to keep the bed of her husband chaste and rear her little boys—so early , briskly , in such good time the fire-god rises up from his downy bed to labor at his forge
hector struggled for words , his helmet flashing : who are you , my lord — who of the high gods — to probe me face-to-face ?
but the lord of the war cry aimed for helenus ' hand gripping his polished bow — and clean through his fist the bronze spearhead drove and cracked the tensed weapon
call up the joy of war !
this sign is yours : troy rests in your power
what good will it do him ?
and deep in his well-built lodge achilles slept with the woman he brought from lesbos , phorbas ' daughter , diomede in all her beauty sleeping by his side
armies gathering now as the huge flocks on flocks of winging birds , geese or cranes or swans with their long lancing necks — circling asian marshes round the cayster outflow , wheeling in all directions , glorying in their wings — keep on landing , advancing , wave on shrieking wave and the tidal flats resound
a brisk command , and the runner snapped to it — he dashed along the wall of the argive men-at-arms till he reached the two aeantes , stopped and shouted , ajax — ajax !
deeply shaken , i pray to the country nymphs and father mars who strides the fields of thrace : make this sight a blessing , lift the omen ’ s weight !
now the sea was going red with the rays of dawn , from the heavens gold aurora shone in her rose-red car when the wind died down , suddenly every breeze fell flat and the oars struggle against a sluggish , leaden swell
but not his body : i will hand it back to the decked ships , so the long-haired achaeans can give him full rites and heap his barrow high by the broad hellespont
and how much better it would have been !
and now this second paris
at that the king of men agamemnon backed down : a painful charge , odysseus , straight to the heart
no fear in your hearts for the quaking rage of zeus , the thundering god of host and welcome stranger — one day he will raze your lofty city for you
they ’ re closing in , i can see their glinting shields , their flashing bronze !
and even mothers up on the ramparts strive— their genuine love of country marks the way , they ’ d seen camilla fight—they hurl their weapons with trembling hands , daring to do the work of iron with pikes of rugged oak and poles charred hard
fathers , founders of our people
to disrupt the tuscans ’ faith , inflame a peaceful people ?
have you no fear of the argives breathing hate and fury ?
you too , unlucky cydon , pursuing clytius , your new love , his cheeks soft with the first gold down of youth— you would have gone down under the trojan ’ s hand and died a pitiful death , with all recall of your young boy lovers lost , if a pack of your brothers had not blocked aeneas , seven of phorcus ’ offspring rifling seven spears , some glancing off his shield and his helmet , harmless , others , that loving venus flicked away , just scratched his body
zeus also gave me a son to bear and breed , the splendor of heroes , and he shot up like a young branch , like a fine tree i reared him — the orchard 's crowning glory — but only to send him off in the beaked ships to troy to battle trojans !
much as you care for me , let me hurry out of the city , make my way , all on my own , to achaea 's waiting ships !
facing ares ' power and hector helmed in bronze , they neither turned and ran for their black ships nor traded blows with enemies man-to-man
and idomeneus over there — standing with his cretans — like a god , you see ?
tell me what 's on your mind
so into the bloody , buckling lines rides tarchon , goading his horsemen on with a burst of mixed cries , rallying each by name , spurring the routed back to battle : what ’ s your fear , you tuscans forever deaf to shame ?
so they will mutter
but now their commander , swift achilles was led away by achaea 's kings , barely able to bring him round — still raging for his friend — to feast with agamemnon
so she does as she is told
come , while there 's still time , think hard : how can you fight off the argives ' fatal day ?
but father rages now , that hard black heart , always the old outrage , dashing all my plans !
think , should keels laid by a mortal hand enjoy an immortal ’ s rights ?
what good will a man , even one in the next generation , get from you unless you defend the argives from disaster ?
and how they thrilled to see him still alive , safe , unharmed and marching back to their lines , his soul ablaze for war , but his men asked him nothing
what am i saying ?
so , bluster away with your bombast—that ’ s your style !
what is this flight that takes me home ? —a coward ! — will i ever see my laurentine walls and camp again ?
we do have prayers , you know , prayers for forgiveness , daughters of mighty zeus
you and your bluster — you are talking nonsense !
raked by the scathing taunt camilla blazes up in rage , hands off her horse to an aide and takes her stand against the ligurian : fearless on foot and armed like him with a naked sword and still unbattered shield
now fire up the rest of your long-haired achaeans
and iris racing the wind went veering past and hera turned to pallas , calling off the conflict : enough
your favorite man of war
and far on the other side achaean troops came streaming out of the well-benched ships , some to gather the bodies , some the timber
and he called the two aeantes and menelaus : ajax , ajax — lords of the argives — menelaus !
show respect for your own house
cronus ' son has entangled me in madness , blinding ruin — zeus is a harsh , cruel god
yet the spirit inside him never shrinks from claiming to be my equal , never , though other gods will cringe from me in terror
menelaus cut him down , was stripping off his armor — menelaus fierce as a mountain lion sure of his power , seizing the choicest head from a good grazing herd
but the lord of the silver bow devised a phantom — like aeneas to the life , wearing his very armor — and round that phantom trojans and brave achaeans went at each other , hacking the oxhides round their chests , the bucklers full and round , skin-shields , tassels flying
diomedes , odysseus , atreus ' son agamemnon ranged the ranks , made them exchange their armor
omens of this she gave in no uncertain terms
oh , if only my fears were false and i deceived !
pluck your brother from death , if there ’ s a way , or drum up war and abort that treaty they conceived
what drives you on ?
think what a staunch support sarpedon was to you and to all troy while the man was still alive !
all fated wars to come will end in peace , justly , under assaracus ’ future sons— troy can never hold you !
phegeus could not face his assault , his deafening cries ; he flung himself before the chariot , right hand wrestling the horses ’ jaws around as they came charging into him , frothing at their bits , then dragged him dangling down from the yoke as turnus ’ spearhead hit his exposed flank and ripping the double links of his breastplate , there it stuck , just grazing the fighter ’ s skin
suddenly paris struck him under the jaw and ear — and life flew from his limbs and the hateful darkness had him in its grip
and round him phoebus apollo brought a dark cloud down from high sky to the plain to shroud the entire space where hector 's body lay , before the sun 's white fury could sear away his flesh , his limbs and sinews
that challenge made , he closes on his enemy , spear poised for the kill as mezentius answers back : why , you king of cruelty , now that you ’ ve killed my son , why try to make me cringe ?
as the wind we pray for quickens , a harbor opens wide and closer till we can see minerva ’ s temple on the heights
you gods who govern the realm of ghosts , you voiceless shades and chaos— you , the river of fire , you far-flung regions hushed in night— lend me the right to tell what i have heard , lend your power to reveal the world immersed in the misty depths of earth
now , by god , i call a halt to all my anger — it 's wrong to keep on raging , heart inflamed forever
but the other trojans and argive men-at-arms fought on at their ease beneath a clear blue sky — sharp brilliance of sunlight glittering round them , not a cloud in sight to shadow the earth and mountains
here the tiber cuts us off and there the rutulians close the vise , the clang of their armor echoes round our walls
no sooner said than before his eyes , twin doves chanced to come flying down the sky and lit on the green grass at his feet
still , you carry no mean fame to your fathers ’ shades— just tell them this : you died by camilla ’ s spear !
up with you , all you argives geared for combat , stand your ground , right here , until we take the mighty walls of priam !
king who devours his people !
all that he had was lost , lost when the trojans killed his steadfast friend
then old nautes , the one man tritonian pallas taught , making him famous for his knowledge of her arts , giving him answers for what the gods ’ great rage might mean or what the march of fate cried out for— nautes speaks , consoling aeneas with his counsel : son of venus , whether the fates will draw us on or draw us back , let ’ s follow where they lead
ares and pallas led them , both burnished gold , gold the attire they donned , and great , magnificent in their armor — gods for all the world , looming up in their brilliance , towering over troops
your right hand pledged , time and again , to turnus , your blood kin ?
like troops on attack they ’ re heading straight for laocoön— first each serpent seizes one of his small young sons , constricting , twisting around him , sinks its fangs in the tortured limbs , and gorges
there our achaeans swung round from buprasion , heading their high-strung horses back to pylos where all gave glory to zeus among the gods and among all men to nestor
this time , though , he woke before me , came and roused me first and i sent him off to call the men you are after
that burly heart pylaemenes led his paphlagonians out of enetian country , land where the wild mules breed : the men who held cytorus and lived in range of sesamus , building their storied halls along the parthenius river , at cromna , aegialus and the highland fortress erythini
dido was married to sychaeus , the richest man in tyre , and she , poor girl , was consumed with love for him
they took the old captain 's lead , the argive kings all called to the muster now
the shaft pierced the tight belt 's twisted thongs , piercing the blazoned plates , piercing the guard he wore to shield his loins and block the spears , his best defense — the shaft pierced even this , the tip of the weapon grazing the man 's flesh , and dark blood came spurting from the wound
the guide and giant-killer reassured him : so far , old man , no birds or dogs have eaten him
while fortune seemed to allow and fate to suffer the latian state to thrive , i guarded turnus , guarded your city walls
you have acestes , a trojan born of the gods , a ready adviser
i would be pleased to hear him
he burns with lust for the sword , the cursed madness of war and rage to top it off
your sense of justice , your awesome works of war ?
all the treasures of troy hauled from the burning shrines—the sacramental tables , bowls of solid gold and the holy robes they ’ d seized from every quarter—greeks , piling high the plunder
as they came marching in , he hailed them first with peaceful words of welcome : tell us , sons of dardanus—for we know your city , your stock , and we heard that you were sailing here— what do you search for now ?
that is the source of all men ’ s fears and longings , joys and sorrows , nor can they see the heavens ’ light , shut up in the body ’ s tomb , a prison dark and deep
fear exposes the lowborn man at once
nor did prince aeneas hold back from the omen
time and again he asks for news of lausus , again he dispatches runners to recall him , bearing a stricken father ’ s orders
but achilles slaughtered on and on , never pausing , killing trojans and skittish battle-teams at once
perched on a beetling crag , celaeno , prophet of doom—her shrieks erupted from her breast : so , war as well now ?
and deep in his heart brave ajax knew and shuddered — here was work of the gods , thundering zeus on high , cutting him off from battle , dashing all his plans , zeus , determined to grant the trojans triumph now
quickly sarpedon swung his shield before him — balanced and handsome beaten bronze a bronzesmith hammered out with layer on layer of hide inside and stitched with golden rivets round the rim
a hush fell as venulus , following orders , tells his story : my countrymen , we have seen diomedes , seen the argive camp
pallas attacks him , praying first : now , father tiber , grant the spear i ’ m about to hurl a lucky path through rugged halaesus ’ chest— i ’ ll strip him of weapons , hang them on your oak !
only euryalus rose to take him on , heroic volunteer , bred of talaus ' blood and a son of king mecisteus who went to thebes in the old days , when oedipus fell , and there at his funeral games defeated all the thebans
so celaeno shrieked and taking flight , dashed back to the forest
but zeus who marshals the storm clouds warned his queen , now , hera , do not fly into such a rage at fellow gods
but one , one was left me , to guard my walls , my people — the one you killed the other day , defending his fatherland , my hector !
so he cried from far on the city 's heights , the awesome god apollo
and mother , who ruled under the timberline of woody placos once — he no sooner haled her here with his other plunder than he took a priceless ransom , set her free and home she went to her father 's royal halls where artemis , showering arrows , shot her down
not with a pair like us to urge you on — gods-in-arms sent down with zeus 's blessings , i and pallas athena
and now it encased odysseus ' head , snug around his brows
the entire heartland here is thick with woods , cocytus glides around it , coiling dense and dark
at once devoted aeneas ripped the robe on his shoulders , called the gods for help and flung his hands in prayer : almighty jove , if you still don ’ t hate all trojans , if you still look down with your old sense of devotion , still respect men ’ s labors , save our fleet from fire !
and each soldier scratched his mark on a stone and threw it into atrides agamemnon 's helmet
down come captain aeneas and all his fighters picked for battle , water their horses well and weary troops take rest
not loitering now , not slinking back tomorrow
and the old charioteer warmed to his challenge : great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon — hector and hector 's high hopes ?
she vanished into the dense night
a crack of the whip — the goddess hera lashed the team , and all on their own force the gates of heaven thundered open , kept by the seasons , guards of the vaulting sky and olympus heights empowered to spread the massing clouds or close them round once more , and straight through the great gates she drove the team
the wolf rages , desperate , how can he maul a quarry out of reach ?
god of the wild cry , apollo — so you wrecked the achaeans ' work and drove the men who had built it up with all that grief and labor into headlong panic rout
book twenty-two : the death of hector
i beg you now by your self-respect , your own brave work , by your chief evander ’ s name , your victories won , by my own rising hopes to match my father ’ s fame , don ’ t trust to your feet—hack the foe with swords , that ’ s the way !
deep in the woods on aventine hill the priestess rhea bore him all in secret , into the world of light
true , athena held her peace and said nothing
it ’ s not for first place now mnestheus strives , not for victory— oh , if only— no , let neptune pick the winner he wants but we must not come last , what shame !
listen , this too — take it to heart , i beg you — do not kill me !
invite to the feast our household gods , the gods of our own home and those our host acestes worships , too
at last the day was breaking , the morning star on the rise , aurora had just burned off the night ’ s dank fog , when suddenly out of the woods the weird shape of a man , a stranger , all but starved to death , in wretched condition , emerges , staggers toward us , hands outstretched to us on the beaches , begging mercy
into the flames with councils , all the plans of men , the vows sealed with the strong , unmixed wine , the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted !
he 's still bursting with anger , more than ever — he spurns you , spurns all your gifts
and the raucous trumpet sounds the signal—bloody war !
you who were never wild or reckless in the past
well , go to him yourself — you hover beside him !
my honors never equal yours , whenever we sack some wealthy trojan stronghold — my arms bear the brunt of the raw , savage fighting , true , but when it comes to dividing up the plunder the lion 's share is yours , and back i go to my ships , clutching some scrap , some pittance that i love , when i have fought to exhaustion
what a tale he ’ s told , what a bitter bowl of war he ’ s drunk to the dregs
swift as a dove , flushed in fear from a cave where it nests its darling chicks in crannies , a sudden burst of wings and out its home it flies , terrified , off into open fields and next it skims through the bright , quiet air and never beats a wing
but even so , late as it is , let us contrive to set all this to rights , to bring him round with gifts of friendship and warm , winning words
then earth , the sun , and furies stalking the world below to wreak revenge on the dead who broke their oaths — i swear i never laid a hand on the girl briseis , i never forced her to serve my lust in bed or perform some other task
plunging overboard , even in choppy , heaving seas , just as he dives to ground from his war-car now
there , there in the clouds and high clear sky you dangled
even a fool learns something once it hits him
with that the driver clambered through the trench
you really want to raid some enemy units ?
he woke with a jolt and seeing empty ground where the fast team had stood , men gasping out their lives , retching in all that carnage , he wailed out , sobbing , crying his dear companion 's name and piercing wails broke as the trojans swirled in panic — a desperate rout of them rushing up to the bloodbath there stood staring down at the grisly work the marauders did before they made their dash for the beaked ships
but capys with other saner heads who take his side , suspecting a trap in any gift the greeks might offer , tells us : fling it into the sea or torch the thing to ash or bore into the depths of its womb where men can hide !
he rose up tall and challenged all the argives : son of atreus — all you achaean men-at-arms !
aeneas , opposite , threatens death and doom at once to anyone in his way , he threatens his harried foes that he ’ ll root their city out and , wounded as he is , keeps closing for the kill
so she pressed and zeus the father of men and gods complied at once
there his brothers and countrymen will bury the prince with full royal rites , with mounded tomb and pillar
if there ’ s a path , fly through the air , set me a course to the grove where that rich branch shades the good green earth
and with all good will i say , fight it out with the trojans here !
no use to you now , they will never shroud your body — but they will be your glory burned by the trojan men and women in your honor !
for thetis is always there , his mother always hovering near him night and day
spotting him far out on the open meadow , turnus hits him first with a light spear winged across that empty space then races up to him , halts his team , and rearing over the dying trojan , plants a foot on his neck and tears the sword from his grip—a flash of the blade— he stains it red in the man ’ s throat , and to top it off cries out : look here , trojan , here are the fields , the great land of the west you fought to win in war
and the kings themselves , overcoming their wounds , arrayed them all in proper battle-order
you ’ re roving far too freely , high on the heavens ’ winds , and the father , king of steep olympus , won ’ t allow it
even though his courage may blaze up for combat , his limbs will turn to lead before he knows it , thirst and hunger will overtake him quickly , his knees will cave in as the man struggles on
he raised me as a child , that man of doom , his daughter just as doomed — would to god he would never fathered me !
no doubt the countrymen round about him plague him now , with no one there to defend him , beat away disaster
we have reached the limit
and now , with all good will , polydamas rose and spoke : weigh both sides of the crisis well , my friends
there in the depths of the dark forbidden chamber leto and artemis who showers flights of arrows healed the man and brought him back to glory
so , with a deep groan , the king addressed his armies : friends
the crier talthybius , his voice clear as a god 's , holding the boar in his arms , flanked the great commander
italy is the land you seek ?
if only strife could die from the lives of gods and men and anger that drives the sanest man to flare in outrage — bitter gall , sweeter than dripping streams of honey , that swarms in people 's chests and blinds like smoke — just like the anger agamemnon king of men has roused within me now
but athena , missing nothing of phoebus ' foul play that robbed diomedes , sped to the gallant captain , handed him back his whip , primed his team with power and flying after admetus ' son in full immortal fury the goddess smashed his yoke
with my own eyes i ’ ve seen him snatch a pair of our men in one massive hand and , sprawling amidst his lair , crush their bodies on the rocks till the cave ’ s maw swam with splashing blood
so the trojans storm in , their commander heading them toward the foe , their tight ranks packed in a wedge , comrade linked with comrade massing hard
it 's not right to batter another deathless god , not for the sake of these mortals
and i , i go to his side — nothing i do can help him
so , you ca not stand up to the battling menelaus ?
aeneas stopped , struck by the sight
once the men had prayed and flung the barley , first they lifted back the heads of the victims , slit their throats , skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat , a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh
quickly cocking his arm , his lance brandished high , he cranes up at the moon and prays his heart out : you , goddess , latona ’ s daughter !
to what extremes won ’ t you compel our hearts , you accursed lust for gold ?
caesar himself , throned at brilliant apollo ’ s snow-white gates , reviews the gifts brought on by the nations of the earth and he mounts them high on the lofty temple doors as the vanquished people move in a long slow file , their dress , their arms as motley as their tongues
so here the twins were laid low at aeneas ' hands , down they crashed like lofty pine trees axed
but i have you with me now
no man will hurl me down to death , against my fate
antilochus thrust first , speared the horsehair helmet right at the ridge , and the bronze spearpoint lodged in the man 's forehead , smashing through his skull and the dark came whirling down across his eyes — he toppled down like a tower in the rough assault
oh would to god — father zeus , athena and lord apollo — not one of all these trojans could flee his death , not one , no argive either , but we could stride from the slaughter so we could bring troy 's hallowed crown of towers toppling down around us — you and i alone !
turn them back , do not let them engage me here
but where does the build-up end ?
our rites complete , at once we swing our sails to the wind on yardarm spars and put astern this home of greeks , the fields we dare not trust
we ’ ve hacked a path through enemy lines—enough !
rapturous song and the beat and sway of dancing
i and my warring kings— a mockery of a prophet , am i ?
fearless bellerophon killed them all
your great father destroyed the sacred heights of troy , thanks , of course , to a man 's stupidity , proud laomedon
remember , each of you , sons , wives , wealth , parents — are mother and father dead or alive ?
then , for the first time the full horror came home to me at last
remember — let no loss of memory overcome you when the sweet grip of slumber sets you free
the city flowered for many years till king mezentius came to power—his brutal rule , barbaric force of arms
you alone know how and when to approach him , soothe his moods
meges killed pedaeus , antenor 's son , a bastard boy but lovely theano nursed him with close , loving care like her own children , just to please her husband
that man who robbed me of many sons , brave boys , cutting them down or selling them off as slaves , shipped to islands half the world away
well euchenor knew that boarding the ships for troy meant certain death : his father told him so
he 's their father — they have to obey his orders
i go to visit them and dissolve their endless feud — how long they have held back from each other now , from making love , since anger struck their hearts
the last lot , deep in the helm , was acestes ’ own , who dared to try his hand at young men ’ s work
mingling in stock alone , the trojans will subside
so you gods have willed
and trust to it now , we ’ re heading for a battle
this gleaming trophy he gives the fine young runner
but the fine spearman automedon found a cure for that — drawing his long sharp sword from his sturdy thigh he leapt with a stroke to cut the trace horse free — it worked
and so the achaeans stampeded now , unearthly terror , all of them routed now by father zeus and hector — though hector killed just one
so apollo staged the action
but hector , his helmet flashing , answered nothing — he swept past him , hector burning to thrust the argives back at once and tear the life and soul out of whole battalions
and any god i catch , breaking ranks with us , eager to go and help the trojans or achaeans — back he comes to olympus , whipped by the lightning , eternally disgraced
in that spirit he went to the river ’ s edge , drew pure water up from the brimming banks and prayed to the gods , over and over , weighing down the heavens with his vows
never — how could he slip past the sentries unchallenged ?
the armies roared applause
my heart is torn in two as i try to weigh all this
but zeus 's daughter athena spurred the argives on — athena first in glory , third-born of the gods — whenever she saw some slacker hanging back as she hurtled through the onset
he killed eetion , not that he stripped his gear — he would some respect at least — for he burned his corpse in all his blazoned bronze , then heaped a grave-mound high above the ashes and nymphs of the mountain planted elms around it , daughters of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder
they tore the weasel-cap from the head , stripped the wolf pelt , the reflex bow and long tough spear and swinging the trophies high to pallas queen of plunder , exultant royal odysseus shouted out this prayer : here , goddess , rejoice in these , they are yours !
pygmalion , catching sychaeus off guard at the altar , slaughtered him in blood
and his wife bore good bellerophon three children : isander , hippolochus and laodamia
you called them your hosts , once , and the fathers of your brides !
now , leaning his weight upon that kingly scepter , atrides declared his will to all achaea 's armies : friends — fighting danaans , aides-in-arms of ares !
here , the victor and vanquished , i stretch my hands to you , so the men of latium have seen me in defeat
turnus can find his allies for himself
here , before you all , i will name in full the splendid gifts i offer
and they closely skirt the coasts of circe ’ s land where the sun ’ s rich daughter makes her deadly groves resound with her endless song , and deep in her proud halls she kindles fragrant cedar flaring through the night as her whirring shuttle sweeps her fine-spun loom
and struck sthenelaus , ithaemenes ' favorite son — a big rock to the neck snapped the tendons strung to the skull 's base
quick as the wind the rushing iris answered , hera winged me on , the illustrious wife of zeus
we raided thebe once , eetion 's sacred citadel , we ravaged the place , hauled all the plunder here and the armies passed it round , share and share alike , and they chose the beauty chryseis for agamemnon
you will find them a trial , though you are my wife
if fight we must
lift up your eyes and search , and once you find it , duly pluck it off with your hand
whatever falls to us now , we both will share one peril , one path to safety
phrygian women—that ’ s what you are—not phrygian men !
and once they would gathered , crowding the meeting grounds , they first put out the fires with glistening wine , wherever the flames still burned in all their fury
but bronze glanced off bronze and never grazed firm flesh , the helmet blocked it , triple-ply with the great blank hollow eyes , a gift of apollo
with a high thin cry
standing there dazed , your fighting spirit dead — what are you waiting for ?
three daughters are his in his well-built halls , chrysothemis and laodice and iphianassa — and you may lead away whichever one you like , with no bride-price asked , home to peleus ' house
some strike seeds of fire buried in veins of flint , some strip the dense thickets , lairs of wild beasts , and lighting on streams , are quick to point them out
recognizing his kin , he gladly leads us home , each word of welcome breaking through his tears
dares like some captain assaulting a steep city wall or laying siege to a mountain stronghold under arms , now this approach , now that , exploring the whole fort with skill , with every kind of assault , and all no use
oh , think back on the twists and turns of war
imbrasus had reared them himself in lycia once and equipped them both with matching weapons either to fight close-up or outrace the winds on horseback
we are allies bound as one
here asius flogged his team and chariot hard , nor did he find the gates shut , the bolt shot home , not yet , the men still held them wide , hoping to save some comrade fleeing the onset , racing for the ships
sail home to the fatherland we love !
long as the trojan stragglers took to their heels and ran , the weapon did its work , but once it came up against the immortal armor forged by the god of fire , vulcan , the mortal sword burst at a stroke , brittle as ice , and glinting splinters gleamed on the tawny sand
you , you were their greatest glory while you lived — now death and fate have seized you , dragged you down !
then i would gladly stand and fight for patroclus
should he drive back to the rout and soldier on ?
now you have robbed me of great glory , saved their lives with all your deathless ease
white terror seized them all
dead set now on that , he drove prince hector against the hollow hulls though the son of priam raged in his own right , raged like ares with brandished spear , or flash fire roaring down from a ridge into thick stands of timber
behind their backs he strapped their hands , the captives he planned to send below as gifts to appease the shades , sprinkling latin blood on the pyre that burned their corpses
so hector urged his armies
you keep guard at our back , so no patrol can attack us from the rear— you be on the alert , a hawk ’ s eye all around
and in their midst the brilliant achilles began to arm for battle
your ghost , my father , he replied , your grieving ghost , so often it came and urged me to your threshold !
the rest fought on like a mass of whirling fire
he was the first to launch a spear against you , patroclus o my rider , but did not bring you down
is this our reward for reverence , this the way you give us back our throne ?
you will never set your eyes on the day of doom that topples looming troy
and into the traces he ran the purebred bold dancer — achilles seized him once when he stormed eetion 's city , a mortal war-horse pacing immortal horses now
a thousand men he rushes aboard , tight ranks spiked with spears
scatter out from port on different routes
seize your moment now
so now , out of epean spoils , the old king chose a herd of cattle and handsome flock of sheep , three hundred head he picked , the herdsmen too
the conqueror of asia
but patroclus nerved for battle dressed him down : meriones , brave as you are , why bluster on this way ?
what can he dare say now to the queen in all her fury and win her over ?
down he strode from olympus ' peaks , storming at heart with his bow and hooded quiver slung across his shoulders
if not , atrides , that outrage would have been your last !
there we can go to bed at once — since love is now your pleasure !
and the heralds cried out at the break of day , 'pylians — come collect your debts from wealthy elis !
no taking us off guard , no hanging back , no dread must cripple our steps with anxious second thoughts when the gods allow us to pull our standards up , strike camp , and move the army out
rocks heaved by a catapult pounding city ramparts never storm so loudly , never such a shattering bolt of thunder crashing forth
royal son of laertes , great tactician — come , home we go now
and next aeneas returns to his ships and shipmates , picks the best and bravest to take his lead in war while the rest glide on at ease , no oars required as the river ’ s current bears them on downstream to bring ascanius news of his father and his affairs
how great are the pains that priam and priam 's sons have heaped on you that you rage on , relentless , forever bent on razing the well-built heights of troy ?
and the tested veteran leonteus speared hippomachus , gouged antimachus ' offspring down across the belt , then drawing his long sharp sword from its sheath he rushed the front and took antiphates first with a quick thrust , stabbing at close range — he slammed on his back , sprawled along the ground
with that appeal , headlong down from the heights of heaven she dove , girt up in clouds , unfurling a whirlwind through the air and winging straight at the trojan ranks and latian camp
i swear by the skies up there , the stars , they know it all !
he is far too strong
you winds , you dare make heaven and earth a chaos , raising such a riot of waves without my blessings
first the leaders , antlers branching over their high heads , he brings them down , then turns on the herd , his shafts stampeding the rest like rabble into the leafy groves
father zeus has lopped the crowns of a thousand cities , true , and zeus will lop still more — his power is too great
so now you feel the weight of your mother 's curses — hera plotted against you , hera up in arms because you left the achaean forces in the lurch and rushed to defend these reckless , headlong trojans !
and suddenly hera taunted the father , son of cronus : so , who of the gods this time , my treacherous one , was hatching plans with you ?
you bear the brunt of troy 's and lycia 's fighting — you are our bravest men , whatever the enterprise , pitched battle itself or planning our campaigns , so stand your ground right here !
he begged the whole achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders , atreus ' two sons , and all ranks of achaeans cried out their assent , arespect the priest , accept the shining ransom !
go now , take your meal — the sooner to bring on war
there is the heat of love , the pulsing rush of longing , the lover 's whisper , irresistible — magic to make the sanest man go mad
— no wasted shot , it whizzed from his hand and punched the flat top of tydides ' right foot , the shaft dug through and stuck fast in the ground
now here the spear of aeneas had stuck , borne home by its hurling force , and the tough roots held it fast
but who of his guests would greet his enemy now , meet him face-to-face and ward off grisly death ?
this tradition of drill and these mock battles : ascanius was the first to revive the ride when he girded alba longa round with ramparts , teaching the early latins to keep these rites , just as he and his fellow trojan boys had done , and the albans taught their sons , and in her turn great rome received the rites and preserved our fathers ’ fame
catching her as she faints away , her women bear her back to her marble bridal chamber and lay her body down upon her bed
the story goes that ancient pelasgians , first in time long past to settle the latian borders , solemnized the grove and a festal day to silvanus , god of fields and flocks
but you must go alone , no other trojan attend you , only a herald with you , a seasoned , older one who can drive the mules and smooth-running wagon and bring the hero 's body back to sacred troy , the man that brilliant achilles killed in battle
olympian zeus commands you to ransom royal hector , to bear gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
no kin , no women commit his corpse to the flames — the dogs will tear his flesh before our walls !
aeneas slaughtered medon and iasus outright , medon the bastard son of royal king oileus , little ajax ' brother , but medon lived in phylace , banished from native land — he would killed a kinsman dear to oileus ' wife , his stepmother eriopis
let me barter death as the price of fame
when he saw the wound where the tearing arrow hit , he sucked out the blood and deftly applied the healing salves that chiron , friend of asclepius , gave his father long ago
here the dolopians formed ranks— here savage achilles pitched his tents— over there the armada moored and here the familiar killing-fields of battle
just give me the strength to shield my grandson , bear him quite unscathed from the raw clash of arms
so much slaughter the trojan commander spreads throughout the plain like a stream in spate or black tornado storming on till at last the young ascanius and his troops break free and put the camp behind
but off in his beaked seagoing ships he lay , raging away at atrides agamemnon , king of armies , while his men sported along the surf , marking time , hurling the discus , throwing spears and testing bows
but if down deep some prophecy makes him balk , some doom his noble mother revealed to him from zeus , at least let achilles send patroclus into battle
— another born to die ?
and now , while the two made love in the large carved bed , menelaus stalked like a wild beast , up and down the lines — where could he catch a glimpse of magnificent paris ?
our long-haired achaeans routed again , driven in terror off the plain to crowd the ships , but why ?
the three cities that i love best of all are argos and sparta , mycenae with streets as broad as troy 's
so grief gives way to grief , my life one endless sorrow !
ever since my sychaeus , my poor husband met his fate , and my own brother shed his blood and stained our household gods , this is the only man who ’ s roused me deeply , swayed my wavering heart
she brings out robes shot through with gilded thread and a phrygian cloak for ascanius
lead black cattle there , first offerings of atonement
he finished othryoneus , a man who would lived in cabesus , one who had just come at the rousing word of war and asked for priam 's loveliest daughter , cassandra — with no bride-price offered — but othryoneus promised a mighty work of battle : he would rout the unwilling argives out of troy
father zeus , athena , apollo , if all my fighters had such courage pounding inside their chests , we would bring king priam 's citadel crashing down in an instant , sacked at our hands — annihilated
the terrible blazing of those eyes , and his winged words went flying : why , why now ?
altars ring the pyre
and following turnus comes a cloud of troops on foot , shield-bearing battalions swarming the whole plain
and first he gave his drivers strict commands to rein their teams back hard and never panic , no fouling them in the onslaught : let no man , so sure of his horsemanship and soldier 's prowess , dare to fight it out alone with the trojans , exposed in front of his lines
these were her parting words and for all my tears—i longed to say so much— dissolving into the empty air she left me now
but far away , high on a mountain lookout , quite amazed to see the fleet of his old friends coming in , acestes rushes down to meet them there—a wild figure bristling spears and a libyan she-bear ’ s hide
so often he hangs back , with no heart for the work , not that he shrinks from action , skittish or off guard — it 's just that he looks to me , waiting for me to make the first move
what cause , what craving has sailed your ships to italy , crossing many seas ?
so now the open sea is blocked to the trojans , no escape , no hope
back through stakes and across the trench they fled , and hordes were cut down at the trojans ' hands — the rest , only after they reached the shipways , stood fast and shouting out to each other , flung their arms to all the immortals , each man crying out a prayer
aeneas rises from his high seat and first he rakes the fires asleep on hercules ’ altar , then gladly goes to the lowly gods of hearth and home he worshipped just the day before
aeneas , the guest of honor , he invites to a throne of maple , cushioned soft with a shaggy lion ’ s hide
shifting on her glistening feet , the goddess answered , why
by your sacred head , by the bed of our own marriage that i , at least , would never take in vain
hector looked up , saw him , started to tremble , nerve gone , he could hold his ground no longer , he left the gates behind and away he fled in fear — and achilles went for him , fast , sure of his speed as the wild mountain hawk , the quickest thing on wings , launching smoothly , swooping down on a cringing dove and the dove flits out from under , the hawk screaming over the quarry , plunging over and over , his fury driving him down to beak and tear his kill — so achilles flew at him , breakneck on in fury with hector fleeing along the walls of troy , fast as his legs would go
or a young woman , is it ?
the grand palace of priam would stand once more , with my own hands i would fortify a second troy to house my trojans in defeat
next in the draw came hardy lord eumelus , atrides menelaus the famous spearman next and meriones drew the fourth starting-lane and tydides diomedes drew the fifth and last , the best of them all by far at driving battle-teams
the king of the gods , whose power sways earth and sky— he is the one who sends me down from brilliant olympus , bearing commands for you through the racing winds
i shrink from mounting our chariot — no retreat — on foot as i am , i will meet them man-to-man
the woods and savage seas are calm , at rest , and the circling stars are gliding on in their midnight courses , all the fields lie hushed and the flocks and gay and gorgeous birds that haunt the deep clear pools and the thorny country thickets all lie quiet now , under the silent night , asleep
men say i am his son
dido , oh poor fool , is it only now your wicked work strikes home ?
i will never forget him , not as long as i am still among the living and my springing knees will lift and drive me on
the son , the father , the whole trojan line—i should have wiped them out , then hurled myself on the pyre to crown it all !
they grouped on the meeting grounds , morale broken
but our far-flung friends , they are fast asleep , they leave the watch to us — their wives and children are hardly camped nearby
here , accept these gifts , this ransom
only then can you set eyes on the stygian groves and the realms no living man has ever trod
there was a custom in latium , land of the west , and ever after revered in alban towns and now great rome that rules the world reveres it too , when men first rouse the war-god into action , whether bent on bringing the griefs of war to the getae , the hyrcanians , or the arabs or marching on india , out to stalk the dawn and reclaim the standards taken by the parthians
indeed , i ’ ll send out trusty men to scour the coast of libya far and wide
all for a girl , just one , and here we offer you seven — outstanding beauties — that , and a treasure trove besides
rubbing his tears off dumbly with a fist
you , they say , the river-nymph sebethis once bore telon , an old man now , when telon ruled over capreae , the teleboean isle
in the same breath the god apollo dives from the vaulting skies and cleaving the gusty winds searches for ascanius
deep below it a vast cavern thunders , hollowed out like vaults under etna , forming the cyclops ’ forges
now i was his blood kin , a youngster when my father , a poor man , sent me off to the war at troy as palamedes ’ comrade
now i am determined to praise you all the more , you who dared — seeing me in these straits — to venture out from the walls , all for my sake , while the others stay inside and cling to safety
we can not find a thing
the cretan captain idomeneus answered , thoas — no man 's to blame now , so far as i can tell
his chariot 's finished off with gold and silver , the armor he 's brought in with him , gold too , tremendous equipment — what a marvelous sight
so up i went to him , eagerly showed him round the walls of pheneus
he 's the one they will obey
mnestheus hands nisus a fine shaggy hide stripped from a lion , and trusty old aletes exchanges helmets with him
why such fear , such terror ?
his mother clutched his hand and urged him , called his name : my child — why have you left the bitter fighting , why have you come home ?
with that concession the prince sat down again
and laying the victims in the chariot , noble priam climbed aboard , pulling the reins back taut
you and your boy there , you grand and glorious powers
at last a piercing blare of the trumpet—suddenly all the ships burst forth from the line , no stopping them now , the shouts of the sailors hit the skies , the oarsmen ’ s arms pull back to their chests as they whip the swells to foam
and the herald took it round through all the ranks , left to right for luck , and showed it to all achaea 's bravest men
and with that he swung their racers round , mid-flight , back again to the rout — trojans and hector after them , shouting their savage cries and pelting both men now with spears and painful arrows
so keen to be gone , the men drag down from the forest untrimmed timbers and boughs still green for oars
but first i had better set to rest the flood you ruffled so
then for a third test he brought the amazons down , a match for men in war
but their feathers take no stab-wounds , backs no scars and swift on their wings they soar toward the heavens , leaving behind half-eaten prey and trails of filth
father zeus has lopped the crowns of a thousand cities , true , and zeus will lop still more — his power is too great
that man who drags patroclus back to trojan charioteers , dead as patroclus is , and makes great ajax yield — to him i will give one half the bloody spoils , keep half for myself — his glory will equal mine !
the archer loosed a fresh shaft from the bowstring straight for hector , his spirit longing to hit him — but he missed and cut gorgythion down instead , a well-bred son of priam , a handsome prince , and the arrow pierced his chest , gorgythion whom priam 's bride from aesyme bore one day , lovely castianira lithe as a deathless goddess
they quickly lowered the chest in a deep , hollow grave and over it piled a cope of huge stones closely set , then hastily heaped a barrow , posted lookouts all around for fear the achaean combat troops would launch their attack before the time agreed
do not let your spirit turn you down that path , dear boy
we were all witnesses then
so he warned but failed to shake euphorbus who shot right back , now , high and mighty atrides , now by heaven you pay in blood for the brother you laid low !
then out he went on foot to range the ranks
i swear by aeneas ’ fate , by his right hand proved staunch in loyalty , strong in feats of arms , that many nations , many—and don ’ t slight us now because we come with an olive branch held out and desperate pleas—that many people have urged us , strongly , to join them as allies
he 's off to the fast ships to tell the swift achilles
now there would have been havoc , irreversible chaos , the trojans penned in the walls of troy like sheep , but the father of men and gods was quick to the mark
others harness teams to chariots , others vault up onto their horses , swords brandished , tense for attack
no other achaean fighter could heft that shaft , only achilles had the skill to wield it well : pelian ash it was , a gift to his father peleus presented by chiron once , hewn on pelion 's crest to be the death of heroes
aeneas cries to achates : give me a sheaf of weapons !
what did you feel then , dido , seeing this ?
shall the country look on turnus in full retreat ?
now , yes , you have ransomed your dear son — for a king 's ransom
nor can they tear themselves away till the dank night comes wheeling round the heavens studded with fiery stars
what violence lands you on this frightful coast ?
if the trojans had that courage , unswerving courage that fires men who fight for their own country , beating their enemies down in war and struggle , then we could drag patroclus back to troy at once
it 's obvious — any fool can see it
but lausus , seeing it all , groaned low with the love he bore his father , tears poured down his face and now , lausus , your fated , brutal death and your brave deeds— if glorious work long ages old can win belief— neither your record nor yourself will i ever fail to sing , young soldier , you deserve our praise
till i can return to troy and tell them all , the old counselors , all our wives , to pray to the gods and vow to offer them many splendid victims
only yesterday zeus went off to the ocean river to feast with the aethiopians , loyal , lordly men , and all the gods went with him
those borne by the stream have found their graves
but you and your anger !
mnestheus , fierce serestus are spurring on the work , the men whom captain aeneas charged , should crisis call , to marshal troops in ranks and take command of the outpost
he always gave us gifts to warm our hearts , gifts for the gods who rule the vaulting skies
futile — she could never seduce the man 's strong will , his seasoned , firm resolve
the beast won ’ t move into battle till he takes a deep wound in his chest from the hunters , then he revels in combat , tossing the rippling mane on his neck he snaps the spear some stalker drove in his flesh and roars from bloody jaws , without a fear in the world
trojans , tyrians : they will be all the same to me
but collect it , call it back from the rank and file ?
what fine bearing , the man himself !
gear up for battle now !
so the soldiers bantered but not odysseus
or did hector send you out to spy on our ships , reconnoiter them stem to stern ?
and then , from that day on , i will turn the tide of war : back the fighting goes , no stopping it , ever , all the way till achaean armies seize the beetling heights of troy through athena 's grand design
so the crash of the breakers all fell silent once their father , gazing over his realm under clear skies , flicks his horses , giving them free rein , and his eager chariot flies
all ranks held their peace but diomedes lord of the war cry spoke up briskly : nestor , the mission stirs my fighting blood
men in their prime from argos , ranks of auruncans , rutulians , sicanian veterans on in years , sacranians in columns , labicians bearing their painted shields , men who plow your glades , old tiber , the numicus ’ holy banks , whose plowshare turns the rutulian slopes and circe ’ s high-ridged cape
then the famous horseman peleus took me into his halls , he reared me with kindness , appointed me your aide
but now — quickly , call up the wild joy of war at once !
shore clash with shore , sea against sea and sword against sword—this is my curse—war between all our peoples , all their children , endless war !
but diomedes lord of the war cry answered , right , old soldier — all you say is true
still , here i stay on olympus throned aloft , here in my steep mountain cleft , to feast my eyes and delight my heart
and shining hector was first to hurl his spear — at the giant ajax veering into him , full face — a direct hit where two straps crossed his chest , one for the shield , one for the silver-studded sword but both flexed taut to guard his glistening skin
so he vowed and brilliant achilles strode back to his shelter , sat down on the well-carved chair that he had left , at the far wall of the room , leaned toward priam and firmly spoke the words the king had come to hear : your son is now set free , old man , as you requested
agamemnon took his seat and nestor rose among them
but wait : let us question a holy man , a prophet , even a man skilled with dreams — dreams as well can come our way from zeus — come , someone to tell us why apollo rages so , whether he blames us for a vow we failed , or sacrifice
from the rest achaean soldiers bought their rations , some with bronze and some with gleaming iron , some with hides , some with whole live cattle , some with slaves , and they made a handsome feast
and heracles ' son tlepolemus tall and staunch led nine ships of the proud rhodians out of rhodes , the men who lived on rhodes in three island divisions , lindos and ialysus and camirus ' white escarpment , armies led by the famous spearman tlepolemus whom astyochea bore to heracles filled with power
any fighter , cut off from his wife for one month , would chafe at the benches , moaning in his ship , pinned down by gales and heavy , raging seas
and at last achilles , turning away from the corpse-fire , sank down , exhausted
and some are working the bellows sucking the air in , blasting it out , while others are plunging hissing bronze in the brimming troughs , the ground of the cavern groaning under the anvils ’ weight , and the cyclops raising their arms with all their power , arms up , arms down to the drumming , pounding beat as they twist the molten mass in gripping tongs
you have a thousand names , a thousand deadly arts
once they are packed in the walls and catch their breath , close the thickset gates and bolt them tight again
so i must speak up and drive the matter home
quickly , lords of the argives , all my captains , judge between us — impartially , no favoritism — so none of our bronze-armed men can ever say , 'only with lies did atrides beat antilochus out and walk off with the mare — his team was far slower but the king 's own rank and power took the prize !
we will fight again tomorrow — until some fatal power decides between us both , handing victory down to one side or the other
no rustic free-for-all with clubs and charred stakes— they ’ ll fight to the finish now with two-edged swords
no stranger to wild goats who graze it when flying arrows are planted in their backs
and i , cast from my country , bound for the ocean ’ s ends— irresistible fortune and inescapable fate have planted me in this place , spurred on by my mother ’ s dire warnings , the nymph carmentis , and god apollo ’ s power
never abate your fury !
we can supply the bronze , the shipwrights , docks and tackle
my great home is here , my fountainhead gives rise to noble cities
away with you now
look , a world away from his fatherland he 's perished , lacking me , my fighting strength , to defend him
enflamed by his taunts and watching his brilliant work , the arcadians , armed with grief and shame , stand braced to meet the enemy
at the same time zeus the father whipped his team and hurtling chariot straight from ida to mount olympus , soon to reach the sessions of the gods
then captain aeneas calls from his high stern , his hands extending the olive branch of peace : we ’ re trojans born
they seize some galleys set to sail , load them with gold— the wealth pygmalion craved—and they bear it overseas and a woman leads them all
the spears recede , the flames roll back before me
your turn now — keep on shielding our fast ships from this latest mass attack
comrades heaved him up and swept him clear of the fighting , far downfield till they gained his team of racers standing behind the rear lines and rush of battle , their driver and blazoned chariot held in tow
and the swift runner achilles reassured him warmly : why have you returned to me here , dear brother , friend ?
or pity me , you , great father of gods , and whirl this hated body down to hell with a bolt , the only way i know to burst the chains of this , this brutal life !
so he urged and hector obeyed his brother start to finish
now what wails of men will the field of mars send up to mars ’ tremendous city !
captains fight and die now the gates of mighty olympus ’ house are flung wide open
hunting the dark glens , day after day , we ’ ve scouted the city ’ s outposts , reconnoitered every bend in the river
his voice so firm that achilles caused the other kings to scatter
their cries rang out
so they embark with cheers to speed them on their way and the dark tarred hulls go gliding through the river , amazing the tides , amazing the groves unused to the sight of warriors ’ shields , flashing far , and blazoned galleys moving on upstream
aeneas the hero , god of the land : you know yourself , you confess you know that he is heaven bound , his fate will raise aeneas to the stars
we will never take the broad streets of troy
his groans convince us , cutting all our show of violence short
then priam and herald , minds set on the journey home , bedded down for the night within the porch 's shelter
but you , poor men , run now , run for your lives , cut your hawsers , sail away !
trojans , never trust that horse
they scatter to posts and man the watch by turns or stretching out on the grass , enjoy their wine , tilting the bronze bowls while the fires burn on and the watchmen dice away a sleepless night
book seven : ajax duels with hector
i will obey you , your demands
terror gripped the fighters looking on , stallion-breaking trojans , argive men-at-arms
but now , as it is , the fates of death await us , thousands poised to strike , and not a man alive can flee them or escape — so in we go for attack !
both of you — fight to save the achaean armies , call up your courage , no cringing panic now !
then at last i saw it all , all ilium settling into her embers , neptune ’ s troy , toppling over now from her roots like a proud , veteran ash on its mountain summit , chopped by stroke after stroke of the iron axe as woodsmen fight to bring it down , and over and over it threatens to fall , its boughs shudder , its leafy crown quakes and back and forth it sways till overwhelmed by its wounds , with a long last groan it goes—torn up from its heights it crashes down in ruins from its ridge
till now i would hoped , hoped with all my heart that i alone would die far from the stallion-land of argos , here in troy , but you , patroclus , would journey back to phthia and then you would ferry neoptolemus home from scyros , fast in your black ship , and show him all my wealth , my servingmen , my great house with the high vaulting roof
and the murderer lives on in his own country — the man has paid enough , and the injured kinsman curbs his pride , his smoldering , vengeful spirit , once he takes the price
call off this skirmish of ours at once — let these mortals fight themselves to death
how to exalt achilles ?
then , out of thin mist the goddess creates a phantom : aeneas ’ double , but a strange , unearthly sight , a shadow stripped of power , and decking it out in trojan armor , matching the shield and crest on aeneas ’ godlike head , she fills it with hollow words , gives it a voice , sound without sense , and it apes his marching stride
trust in the tale is old , yet its fame will never die
at this point , venus , shocked by the unfair pain her son endures , culls with a mother ’ s care some dittany fresh from cretan ida , spear erect with its tender leaves and crown of purple flowers
how well i recall the face , the words , the voice of your father , king anchises
forget the orders — nothing to fear , my friend , neither ares nor any other god
set sail now , the god commands , blest in the dedication of your son
the fates will find the way
again the iron warrior brought his brother round — good counsel , fitting too
icy shudders rack my limbs—my blood chills with fear
hurry , head our chariot right where the fighting 's thickest , there — horse and infantry hurling into the slaughter , hacking each other down , terrific war cries rising !
so you go back to the great men of achaea
he 's knocked the bow from my grip , snapped the string , the fresh gut i tied to the weapon just at dawn to launch the showers of arrows i would let fly
but high-hearted tydides drove away the team and gave them to aides to lash both horses back to the hollow ships
now hera poised on her golden throne looked down , stationed high at her post aloft olympus ' peak
my hand on his altar now , i swear by the gods and fires that rise between us here , the day will never dawn when italian men will break this pact , this peace , however fortune falls
then he turns to his comrades , bands of officers pressing round him there , and aeneas starts in to stir their spirits flushed with recent triumph : what magnificent things we ’ ve done , my friends !
they murmured low but priam , raising his voice , called across to helen , come over here , dear child
finally diomedes lord of the war cry shouted out , no one touch the treasures of paris , helen either !
five flocks of cattle he had in tow and five came home from pasture , a hundred plowshares made his topsoil churn
camilla ’ s life breath fled with a groan of outrage down to the shades below
with that , he fled into thin air like a wisp of smoke
may turnus see me stripping the bloody armor off his body , bear the sight of his conqueror—eyes dulled in death !
you tell me that i ca not stand up to monstrous ajax ?
and telamonian ajax struck anthemion 's son , the hardy stripling simoisius , still unwed
praying , his mind at sea , wavering here , there , crazed by his own disgrace—should he fling himself on his sword and thrust the ruthless blade through his ribs ?
hurry , my friend , this way — fight for dead patroclus !
first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves , fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps , next he strapped a breastplate round his chest , his brother lycaon 's that fitted him so well
one more thing — take it to heart , i urge you
juno kept them far from latium , forced by the fates to wander round the seas of the world , year in , year out
at least we could bring his body back to achilles , stripped as patroclus is — but not achilles ' armor : hector with that flashing helmet has seized it all
and you too , turnus , would now be standing here , a tremendous trunk of oak decked out in armor if pallas had had your years and strength to match
permit me to risk the first shock of battle
ortilochus sired diodes , that proud heart , and diodes bred orsilochus twinned with crethon drilled for any fight
glaucus cried a prayer to the distant deadly archer : hear me , lord apollo !
so stop your babbling , mouthing the names of kings , flinging indecencies in their teeth , your eyes peeled for a chance to cut and run for home
let that man beware , or great and glorious as he is , we mighty gods will wheel on him in anger — look , he outrages the senseless clay in all his fury !
he fell with a crash as idomeneus boasted , shouting over him , bravo , othryoneus , bravo to you beyond all men alive !
but if farseeing zeus does not send you that sign — his own messenger — then i urge you , beg you , do not go down to the ships — not for all the passion in your heart !
just so torn , so slowly but surely turnus backs away , his spirit churning with anger
once they would dragged the bodies back to their lines they dropped the luckless twins in companions ' open arms and round they swung again to fight in the first ranks
he claims he is far greater than you in striking force , he is the first-born too !
but the day soon came when even bellerophon was hated by all the gods
as long as he lives he ’ ll never forget such meritorious service
both men armed at opposing sides of the forces , into the no man 's land between the lines they strode , glances menacing , wild excitement seizing all who watched , the stallion-breaking trojans and argive men-at-arms
once , when that tyrant , metabus , loathed by people for his abuse of power , was drummed from his kingdom , leaving privernum ’ s ancient town , he took his daughter , a baby , with him , fleeing the thick-and-fast of battle , a friend to share his exile
quick , whomever my eye will light on in review , the mission 's theirs
so , this woman , it struck me now , safe and sound she ’ ll look once more on sparta , her native greece ?
and now in his dreams it came again—the god , his phantom , the same features shining clear
yes , but even on him the father piled hardships , no powerful race of princes born in his royal halls , only a single son he fathered , doomed at birth , cut off in the spring of life — and i , i give the man no care as he grows old since here i sit in troy , far from my fatherland , a grief to you , a grief to all your children
with that he hurled his spear , his whole body behind it— whirring on through the dark night , it flies at sulmo and striking his turned back it splits—crack ! — and a splinter stabs his midriff through
she broke off , her voice choking with tears that brimmed and wet her breast
apollo pressed on , wading into the ruck , hurling argives back in chaos and handing glory to hector and all the trojan forces
but deiphobus ' strong swift hurl was not for nothing , no , he caught hypsenor , hippasus ' son the captain , struck him under the midriff , slit his liver and that instant the man 's knees went limp
go tell them to join in friendship , seal their pacts , now i ’ ve spattered the trojans red with italian blood
then round her shoulders she swirled the wondrous robes that athena wove her , brushed out to a high gloss and worked into the weft an elegant rose brocade
but we , if we lose our land , will bow to the yoke , enslaved by our new high lords and masters— we who idle on amid our fields !
but hector marked them across the lines and rushed them now with a cry and trojan shock troops backed him full strength
now turn your eyes this way and behold these people , your own roman people
and now with the strength of xanthus beaten down the two called off their battle
and so , give the command for carthage to crush italy , overwhelm her with force
so he cried and staunch atrides stripped the gear from the corpse and heaving the bloody bronze to eager comrades swung to attack again , frontline assault
go to olympus , plead with zeus , if you ever warmed his heart with a word or any action
not for all the world , nor will all the rest of achaea 's armies
the great mother of gods detains me on these shores
tlepolemus — far across the lines the armed achaeans hauled him out of the fight , and seasoned odysseus saw it , his brave spirit steady , ablaze for action now
so hector could never throw achilles off his trail , the swift racer achilles — time and again he would make a dash for the dardan gates , trying to rush beneath the rock-built ramparts , hoping men on the heights might save him , somehow , raining spears but time and again achilles would intercept him quickly , heading him off , forcing him out across the plain and always sprinting along the city side himself — endless as in a dream
our hard straits have forced me to set defenses , station guards along our far frontiers
so he dissolved again in the proud trojan lines , dreading atrides — magnificent , brave paris
then merops and erymas die at his hands , then aphidnus , even bitias , eyes ablaze , all rage at heart , and not by a spear—he ’ d never give up his life to a spear— a massive pike with a giant blade comes hurtling , roaring into him , driven home like a lightning bolt and neither the two bull ’ s-hides of his shield nor trusty breastplate , double-mailed with its scales of gold , can block its force
his cheeks stained with tears , and pressed by hunger the boy goes up to his father 's old companions , tugging at one man 's cloak , another 's tunic , and some will pity him , true , and one will give him a little cup to drink , enough to wet his lips , not quench his thirst
now pay for your father 's outrage , blood for blood !
— despite their desperate straits
for in my heart and soul i also know this well : the day will come when sacred troy must die , priam must die and all his people with him , priam who hurls the strong ash spear
someone less of a man than i will say , 'our hector — staking all on his own strength , he destroyed his army !
but charis saw her first , charis coming forward , lithe and lovely in all her glittering headdress , the grace the illustrious crippled smith had married
potitius set this altar in the grove
hail , true son of jove , you glory added to all the gods !
that man is atreus ' son agamemnon , lord of empires , both a mighty king and a strong spearman too , and he used to be my kinsman , whore that i am !
and i too , if the same fate waits for me
now left of the ships he sped where argive ranks would head home from the plain with teams and cars
god forbid that achilles sees me turning tail , heading from town and out to open country — he will come after me full tilt and run me down !
from that noble blood will arise a trojan caesar , his empire bound by the ocean , his glory by the stars : julius , a name passed down from iulus , his great forebear
come , let us give each other gifts , unforgettable gifts , so any man may say , trojan soldier or argive , 'first they fought with heart-devouring hatred , then they parted , bound by pacts of friendship
so mercury of cyllene flew between the earth and sky to gain the sandy coast of libya , cutting the winds that sweep down from his mother ’ s father , atlas
how he strangled the first monsters , twin serpents sent by his stepmother , juno—crushed them in his hands
now there ’ s no excuse for those craven sons of aeneas to break their word , to forsake the pact we swore
come , try me in combat , weapons hand-to-hand — bow and spattering shafts will never help you then
till we see if calchas divined the truth or not
now bone-weary , aeneas ’ shipmates make a run for the nearest landfall , wheeling prows around they turn for libya ’ s coast
yet stragglers still stampeded down the plain like cattle driven wild by a lion lunging in pitch darkness down on the whole herd but to one alone a sudden death comes flashing — first he snaps its neck , clamped in his huge jaws , then down in gulps he bolts its blood and guts
we will fight again tomorrow
— achilles the son of sleek-haired thetis may outrace me — struck by my spear first — and gasp away his life !
were the men still alive or just in the last throes , forever lost to their comrades ’ far-flung calls ?
and one of these , in the waist where the braided belt chafes the flesh and the buckle clasps the strap from end to end— a striking , well-built soldier in burnished bronze— the spear splits his ribs and splays him out on the sand
seeing their close-packed ranks , hot for battle , i spur them on their way : men , brave hearts , though bravery can not save us—if you ’ re bent on following me and risking all to face the worst , look around you , see how our chances stand
the white-armed goddess hera could not resist
so then , hera , if you mean what you say , down to the last word , go back now to the deathless tribes of gods and summon iris to come before my presence , summon apollo too , lord of the famous bow
around it hovered numberless races , nations of souls like bees in meadowlands on a cloudless summer day that settle on flowers , riots of color , swarming round the lilies ’ lustrous sheen , and the whole field comes alive with a humming murmur
— blazing achilles broke in quickly — what a worthless , burnt-out coward i would be called if i would submit to you and all your orders , whatever you blurt out
what god drove them to fight with such a fury ?
so , concealing his ships in the sheltered woody narrows overarched by rocks and screened around by trees and trembling shade , aeneas moves out , with only achates at his side , two steel-tipped javelins balanced in his grip
and his sword-hilt is studded with tawny jasper stars , a cloak of glowing tyrian purple drapes his shoulders , a gift that the wealthy queen had made herself , weaving into the weft a glinting mesh of gold
sing to me now , you muses who hold the halls of olympus , who was the first to go up against king agamemnon , who of the trojans or famous trojan allies ?
now he no longer haunted the meeting grounds where men win glory , now he no longer went to war but day after day he ground his heart out , waiting there , yearning , always yearning for battle cries and combat
he summons the east- and westwind , takes them to task : what insolence !
glad for the lucky sign , odysseus prayed to pallas , hear me , daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder !
or capys perhaps , or caicus ’ stern adorned with shields ?
and paris , magnificent as a god , replied , hector , bent on faulting a man without a fault ?
mummius her he will conquer corinth and , famed for killing achaeans , drive his victor ’ s chariot up the capitol ’ s heights
and the famous crippled smith exclaimed warmly , thetis — here ?
he flung his shaft , missing the man on purpose — over his right shoulder the sharp spearpoint winged and stabbed the earth
and the dark blood — wash it out of the wound with clear warm water
here ’ s ornytus riding his calabrian charger in from a distance , all decked out in exotic armor , the huntsman setting up for a soldier
here they impaled me , an iron planting of lances covered my body—now they sprout in stabbing spears !
sisyphus , aeolus ' son , who had a son called glaucus , and in his day glaucus sired brave bellerophon , a man without a fault
what skill do i have to lengthen out your life ?
now take your evening meal throughout the city , just as you always have , and stand your watches , each man wide awake
no seas to plow , no questing after italian fields forever receding on the horizon
you see the coast is clear , our ships and friends restored
ares there — and for all his war cries diomedes shrank at the sight , as a man at a loss , helpless , crossing a vast plain halts short at a river rapids surging out to sea , takes one look at the water roaring up in foam and springs back with a leap
even now they warm the winter , long as it lasts , with obscene desire , oblivious to their kingdoms , abject thralls of lust
no , there he lies — still there at achilles ' ship , still intact in his shelters
a murderous feud broke out between both men
and you with your cunning , forge his appearance—just one night , no more—put on the familiar features of the boy , boy that you are , so when the wine flows free at the royal board and dido , lost in joy , cradles you in her lap , caressing , kissing you gently , you can breathe your secret fire into her , poison the queen and she will never know
they had no notion of custom , no cultured way of life , knew nothing of yoking oxen , laying away provisions , garnering up their stores
i grant your wish
anchors run from prows , the sterns line the shore
squeezing the nock and string together , drawing the gut back to his nipple , iron head to the handgrip till he flexed the great weapon back in a half-circle curve — the bow sprang !
each trojan soldier glancing left and right — how could he run from sudden , plunging death ?
fill my arms with lilies , let me scatter flowers , lustrous roses—piling high these gifts , at least , on our descendant ’ s shade—and perform a futile rite
deadlock : there man killed man in the pell-mell clash of battle , captains going at captains
they say there are twin curses called the furies
some beat out a dance with their feet and chant their songs
berserk for blood , he will find it uphill work to beat their valor down , matchless hands at war , and gut our ships with fire — unless almighty zeus should fling a torch at the fast trim ships himself
a torrent of questions—weeping futile tears , she sobs her long lament as priam ’ s warrior son , helenus , comes from the walls with full cortege
and there he dropped and slept the sleep of bronze , poor soldier , striving to help his fellow trojans , far from his wedded wife , his new bride
both fighters at one great stroke chopped at each other — pisander hacked the horn of the horsehair-crested helmet right at its ridge , lunging as menelaus hacked pisander between the eyes , the bridge of the nose , and bone cracked , blood sprayed and both eyes dropped at his feet to mix in the dust — he curled and crashed
all my lovely rapids are crammed with corpses now , no channel in sight to sweep my currents out to sacred sea — i am choked with corpses and still you slaughter more , you blot out more !
you must not , lost in the flush and fire of triumph , slaughtering trojans outright , drive your troops to troy — what if one of the gods who never die comes down from olympus heights to intervene in battle ?
so venus asked and the son of venus answered : not one of your sisters have i seen or heard
she looked like a young girl , a spartan girl decked out in dress and gear or thracian harpalyce tiring out her mares , outracing the hebrus river ’ s rapid tides
all obey me now
or iris sped from the clouds ?
they reforge in the furnace all their fathers ’ swords
i beg him—pity your sister , anna—one last favor , and if he grants it now , i ’ ll pay him back , with interest , when i die
the men themselves , wading into the sea , washed off the crusted sweat from shins and necks and thighs
balancing these on a facing gate , the land of crete comes rising from the sea
so polydamas stood by headstrong hector , warning , hector — and all our trojan captains , allies-in-arms !
this man 's body for prothoenor 's !
we have fought the good fight with all our kingdom ’ s power
flung from the car he writhes on the field in death as righteous aeneas sends some bitter words his way : lucagus , no panicked pair has let your chariot down , no horses shying away from an enemy ’ s empty shade— it ’ s you , tumbling off your chariot , you desert your team !
there — hector 's signal !
triumphant , the rutulians gathered their battle-plunder , weeping now as they bore the lifeless body of volcens back to camp
as luck would have it , that day arcadia ’ s king was holding solemn annual rites in honor of hercules , amphitryon ’ s powerful son , and paying vows to the gods in a grove before the city
too well i know that ares leads the charge
waiting for others to do your fighting for you ?
never again , i trust , will achilles yield to you
he was bred in the land of ithaca
and brilliant achilles shook his head at the armies , never letting them hurl their sharp spears at hector — someone might snatch the glory , achilles come in second
no mercy , please , turnus pleaded
huge as a masoned pier that falls at times on the shore of euboean baiae—first they build it of massive blocks , then send it crashing over , dragging all in its wake and it crushes down on the ocean floor as the waves roil and black sand goes heaving into the air and prochyta island quakes to its depths and the craggy bed of inarime weighting typhoeus down by jove ’ s command
fate crushed him , and hera 's savage anger
all or nothing — he charges flocks and hauls off bloody prey or he 's run through himself at the first assault with a fast spear driven home
achilles — he 's made his own proud spirit so wild in his chest , so savage , not a thought for his comrades ' love — we honored him past all others by the ships
but murderous achilles — you gods , you choose to help achilles
they first put out the fires with glistening wine , far as the flames had spread and the ashes bedded deep
but a new portent strikes our doomed people now—a greater omen , far more terrible , fatal , shakes our senses , blind to what was coming
whoever begs his mercy he will spare with all the kindness in his heart !
nestor the noble old horseman led those troops in ninety sweeping ships lined up along the shore
after them , faster — full gallop — i will find the way , i have got the skill to slip past him there where the track narrows — i will never miss my chance !
nor did he miss his sister juno ’ s cunning wrath at work
they were the first to trample on our pact
but capaneus ' headstrong son lashed back in style : do not lie , atrides !
what trust they put in their own blind luck !
thankful for my return they will go to meet the gods and sing their praises
so he commanded and the armies gave a deep resounding roar like waves crashing against a cliff when the south wind whips it , bearing down , some craggy headland jutting out to sea — the waves will never leave it in peace , thrashed by gales that hit from every quarter , breakers left and right
with that sharp warning athena seated headlong ares on his throne
now i recall how she ’ d reveal our destination , hesperia : time and again repeating it by name , repeating the name of italy
what god , you muses , warded off such savage flames from the trojans ?
you want this flashing hector to take the fleet then each man walk the waves to regain his native land ?
strongly as he longs to ease and allay her sorrow , speak to her , turn away her anguish with reassurance , still , moaning deeply , heart shattered by his great love , in spite of all he obeys the gods ’ commands and back he goes to his ships
there , yes , where you see the massive ramparts shattered , blocks wrenched from blocks , the billowing smoke and ash— it ’ s neptune himself , prising loose with his giant trident the foundation-stones of troy , he ’ s making the walls quake , ripping up the entire city by her roots
fortune fills our sails in that first clash and coroebus , flushed , fired with such success , exults : comrades , wherever fortune points the way , wherever the first road to safety leads , let ’ s soldier on
achaean troops will never hold the line , i tell you , not while the long ships are being hauled to sea
he hears us , wheels to follow our splashing oars but he has no chance to seize us in his clutches , he ’ s no match for ionian tides in his pursuit , so he gives a tremendous howl that shakes the sea and all its waves , all italy inland shudders in fear and etna ’ s echoing caverns bellow from their depths
the monster , immense , gargantuan , hideous—blind , his lone eye gone— clutching a pine-tree trunk to keep his footing firm
he would be the one to master an italy rife with leaders , shrill with the cries of war , to sire a people sprung from teucer ’ s noble blood and bring the entire world beneath the rule of law
and the first greek to cross our path ?
he rinsed his hands , took the cup from his wife and taking a stand amidst the forecourt , prayed , pouring the wine to earth and scanning the high skies , priam prayed in his rich resounding voice : father zeus !
brace for him , stand our ground together — beat him back !
themillas ’ spear grazed him first , he dropped his shield , the idiot , raised his hand to the gash as the arrow flew and digging deep in his left side , deeper , burst the ducts of his life breath with a deadly wound
but the other grazed achilles ' strong right arm and dark blood gushed as the spear shot past his back , stabbing the earth hard , still lusting to sink in flesh
take first prize and return to your hollow ships while we award this spear to the fighter meriones , if that would please your heart
that was his offer
let roman stock grow strong with italian strength
no blood-price came his way
an archer 's hit him , a good hand at the bow , some trojan or some lycian — all glory to him , a heavy blow to us !
a black cloud of grief came shrouding over achilles
pray for a safe return from all our mortal enemies , seeing you are dead set on going down to the ships — though you go against my will
but idomeneus never slacked his fury , always struggling to plunge some trojan soldier in deep shrouding night or fall himself , beating disaster off his lines
a herald ’ s ringing voice declares cloanthus the victor and aeneas crowns his brows with fresh green laurel
what , wait till turnus deigns to take me on ?
what hope can make you cling to the chilly clouds ?
and just as each of us hoped with all his heart he would dropped and died at the hands of giant ajax
king jupiter is the king to all alike
here the mothers and grief-stricken brides of the dead and their loving sisters , hearts torn with sorrow , and young boys robbed of their fathers— curse this horrendous war and turnus ’ marriage
what is he plotting now ?
achaeans stampeding back till they reined in hard , huddling tight by the sterns and shouting out to each other , flung their arms to all the immortals , each man crying out a prayer
my own fate and the deadly crimes of that spartan whore have plunged me in this hell
that left the famous spearman odysseus on his own , not a single argive comrade standing by his side since panic seized them all
up now , rouse our fighting-fury !
i ’ ve had no strife with trojans since troy fell , nor do i think of those old griefs with any joy
a ship chanced to be moored to a spur of cliff , her ladders and gangways set for action
but the known cowards he drove amidst the center : a man might cringe but he would be forced to fight
hang a great golden cable down from the heavens , lay hold of it , all you gods , all goddesses too : you can never drag me down from sky to earth , not zeus , the highest , mightiest king of kings , not even if you worked yourselves to death
he will go down to the house of death this instant , overwhelmed by achilles — all because he trusted the distant deadly archer 's urgings
periphetes , a mycenaean , favorite son of copreus , eurystheus ' herald who summoned rugged heracles time and again to grinding labors
dung stuffed his mouth , his nostrils dripped muck as shining long-enduring odysseus flashed past him to come in first by far and carry off the cup while ajax took the ox
corynaeus sealed the bones he culled in a bronze urn , then circling his comrades three times with pure water , sprinkling light drops from a blooming olive spray , he cleansed the men and voiced the last farewell
just so androgeos , seeing us , cringes with fear , recoiling , struggling to flee but we attack , flinging a ring of steel around his cohorts— panic takes the greeks unsure of their ground and we cut them all to pieces
these were the argive captains hector killed then went for the main mass like the west wind battering soft shining clouds the south wind wafts along — in deep explosive blasts it strikes and the great swelling waves roll on and on and the spray goes shooting up from under the wind 's hurl swerving , roaring down the sea — so wildly hector routed the packed lines of fighters caught in his onslaught
tell him this : leading chiefs of dardania come , pressing to be his friends-in-arms
the faces of girls , but birds !
and with that achilles stayed his burly hand on the silver hilt and slid the huge blade back in its sheath
now up comes iapyx , iasius ’ son , and dear to apollo , more than all other men , and once , in the anguished grip of love , the god himself gladly offered him all his own arts , his gifts , his prophetic skills , his lyre , his flying shafts
a swirl of thoughts goes racing through his mind , he glances toward his own rutulians and their town , he hangs back in dread , he quakes at death—it ’ s here
aeneas packs them off to death , talos , tanais , staunch cethegus , all three at a single charge , then grim onites too , named for his theban line , his mother called peridia
so , there ’ s no salvation in war , you say ?
with that , a stab of agony struck his deep heart
the old men of the realm held seats above the gates
he tells him mezentius musters fighters to his side , tells him the heart of turnus flares for battle , warns him of what to trust in men ’ s affairs , concluding all with his own strong appeals
barely raising his eyes , palinurus answers : you tell me to forget my sense of the sea ? — the placid face of the swells , the sleeping breakers ?
and the fighters split apart and then closed ranks , marshaled in five battalions , captains leading each
just let aeneas—if he needs us so , and presses so to join in alliance and take the name of comrade— come in person and never shy from the eyes of friends
but you , menelaus o my king , you had no heart to defend the pylians , hard-pressed as they were , once their leader left , a heavy blow to his troops
strangers will mark his lands off , stealing his estates
since then , turnus , you see what assaults , what crises dog my steps , what labors you have shouldered , you , first of all
tyrian dido marveled , first at the sight of him , next at all he ’ d suffered , then she said aloud : born of a goddess , even so what destiny hunts you down through such ordeals ?
altars plundered for torches , down from menacing clouds a torrent of spears , and the iron rain pelts thick-and-fast as they carry off the holy bowls and sacred braziers
— so concerned that his team and car were wrecked , and the fellow too , for all his racing skills
they chafe , sitting in camp , so bent on battle now the kings of achaea can not hold them back
you would never think so many troops could march holding their voices in their chests , all silence , fearing their chiefs who called out clear commands , and the burnished blazoned armor round their bodies flared , the formations trampling on
and the famous crippled smith replied , courage !
the average driver , leaving all to team and car , recklessly makes his turn , veering left and right , his pair swerving over the course — he ca not control them
starting with dardanus , storm-king zeus 's son who founded dardania , long before holy troy arose , that city reared on the plain to shelter all our people
but now pour cups to jove and call on father anchises with our prayers , set out the wine on tables once again !
a new day ’ s dawn was moving over the earth , aurora ’ s torch cleansing the sky , burning away the dank shade of night as the restless queen , beside herself , confides now to the sister of her soul : dear anna , the dreams that haunt my quaking heart !
embracing me as i left that day , he sent me out to win ourselves an empire—fearful , warning that we would face brave men , a battle-hardened people
not with envoys or artful diplomatic probes , i come in person , put my life on the line , a suppliant at your doors to plead for help
away with you , girl , glittering little puppet !
i speed this word to you from storming zeus
for father , i fear — if he 's not dead and buried yet — just clings , perhaps , to his last breath of life , ground down now by the hateful siege of years , waiting , day after day , for painful news of me — until he learns his only son is dead
not even helenus , filled with dreadful warnings , foresaw such grief for me—not even foul celaeno
he treats them kindly and adds these gracious words : what unmerited stroke of fortune , men of latium , traps you so in war that you flee from us , your friends ?
everywhere lie the motionless bodies of the dead , strewn in her streets , her homes and the gods ’ shrines we held in awe
leave the fighting to men
before then , for me at least , neither food nor drink will travel down my throat , not with my friend dead , there in my shelter , torn to shreds by the sharp bronze
even furious juno , now plaguing the land and sea and sky with terror : she will mend her ways and hold dear with me these romans , lords of the earth , the race arrayed in togas
i fear they will pay us back for yesterday 's triumph
vengeance waits , the same fate watches over you too , you ’ ll lie here in the same field—very soon
and once they reached the fertile land of troy they all streamed ashore , row on row in a long cortege , the sea-nymphs filing up where the myrmidon ships lay hauled , clustered closely round the great runner achilles
or does fortune shine again on you , hector ’ s andromache , just as you deserve ?
aeneas puts in here with a bare seven warships saved from his whole fleet
harder to save the warships once they are up in flames
now there was a man , that tydeus , that aetolian
in a flash aeneas , overjoyed now at the sight of the tuscan ’ s blood , sweeps his sword from its sheath and closes fast on his staggered foe
he would extend to you if you will end your anger
well , nine days we should mourn him in our halls , on the tenth we would bury hector , hold the public feast , on the eleventh build the barrow high above his body — on the twelfth we would fight again
some shut the gates , not daring to clear a safe way in for comrades , beg as they will , and a ghastly bloodbath follows , defenders killed at the entries , enemies flung on swords
— or check his rage and beat his fury down ?
wo not you listen to reason ?
she smiled with her lips only , her forehead furrowed over her dark brows as her anguish rose and she addressed them all : what fools we are , storming against zeus — we are mad !
he dispelled the mist at once , drove off the cloud and the sun came blazing forth and the whole war swung into view , clear , that instant — and ajax called the lord of the war cry , menelaus : look hard for antilochus now , my royal friend
i have never seen or heard tell of a single man wreaking so much havoc in one day as hector , zeus 's favorite , wreaks against our troops , and all on his own — no son of god or goddess
their thick armored walls no longer can shield the trojans
there was a trojan , dares , a decent , wealthy man , the god hephaestus ' priest who had bred two sons , phegeus and idaeus , trained for every foray
how they would exult , priam and priam 's sons and all the trojans
fighting against achilles ' overwhelming fury !
when they came to his shepherd 's fold he favored love who dangled before his eyes the lust that loosed disaster
pity the ones whose sons stand up to me in war !
better for you to take this wretched life— by any death you please
but the swift runner achilles answered him at once , just how , agamemnon , great field marshal
and old phoenix first — zeus loves the man , so let him lead the way
look , the achaean champion 's badly wounded — i shot him down , i swear he wo not last long — if the archer really sped me here from lycia !
and i with my spear
fling them at others , do not give me commands !
when dread has left my bones , i bring this omen sent by the gods before our chosen trojan captains , my father first of all : i had to have their judgment
— who are your parents ?
whatever you choose , great hesperia—saturn ’ s fields— or the shores of eryx with acestes as your king , i will provide safe passage , escorts and support to speed you on your way
mad—while through the woods and deserted lairs of wild beasts allecto whips amata on with the lash that whips her maenads
but the pilot answered : captain , anchises ’ son , apollo ’ s prophetic cauldron has not failed you— no god drowned me in open waters
you would be the first to lash out at another — anywhere — you saw hanging back from this , this hateful war
you never neglected me in life , only now in death
killing is no crime
pushing epeans north on the spreading plain we went , killing their troops , gathering up their burnished gear , far as buprasion rich in wheat our chariots rolled , all the way to olenian rock and the high ground they call alesion hill — but there , at last , pallas athena turned our forces back
so ajax and odysseus made their way at once where the battle lines of breakers crash and drag , praying hard to the god who moves and shakes the earth that they might bring the proud heart of achilles round with speed and ease
then they slash the throats of the hallowed victims over the flames , and tear their pulsing entrails out and heap the altars high with groaning platters
grasping my hand she held me back , adding this from her rose-red lips : my son , what grief could incite such blazing anger ?
i beg you , father , give them back their xanthus and their simois if these luckless trojans must , once more , relive the fall of troy !
zeus never dreamed in his heart a single deathless god would go to war for troy 's or achaea 's forces now
here is caesar and all the line of iulus soon to venture under the sky ’ s great arch
true , just like agenor head to foot the deadly archer stood in achilles ' path and achilles sprang in chase , feet racing , coursing him far across the wheat-fields , heading him out toward scamander 's whirling depths as the god led him a little , luring him on and on — always hoping to catch the god with bursts of speed
never doubt your powers
at that a crowd volunteered to go with diomedes
then let me die at once — achilles burst out , despairing — since it was not my fate to save my dearest comrade from his death !
stroke by stroke i swam for land , safety was in my grasp , weighed down by my sodden clothes , my fingers clawing the jutting spurs of a cliff , when a band of brutes came at me , ran me through with knives , the fools , they took me for plunder worth the taking
whatever fortune sends , it ’ s mine
saturn ’ s reign was the age of gold , men like to say , so peacefully , calm and kind , he ruled his subjects
with that , venus reached to embrace her son and set the brilliant armor down before him under a nearby oak
aeneas , ferocious in armor , stood there , still , shifting his gaze , and held his sword-arm back , holding himself back too as turnus ’ words began to sway him more and more
and reaching their prime they joined the argives sailing the black ships outward bound for the stallion-land of troy , all for the sons of atreus , to fight to the end and win their honor back — so death put an end to both , wrapped them both in night
fraud will never carry you home , safe and sound , to your lying father aunus !
and crouching down at his feet , quickly grasping his knees with her left hand , her right hand holding him underneath the chin , she prayed to the lord god zeus , the son of cronus : zeus , father zeus !
latinus had no son , his one male issue torn from him by the gods ’ decrees , in the first bloom of youth
but then , as soon as aeneas entered the high-built gates , they beat their breasts and raised their cries to the sky and the royal lodging groaned with wails of grief
all the italians fought to storm it , full strength , straining to drag it down , full force while trojans , jammed inside , fought to defend it , barricade it with stones , hurling salvos of spears through gaping loopholes
but now scylla to starboard blocks your way , with never-sated charybdis off to port— three times a day , into the plunging whirlpool of her abyss she gulps down floods of sea , then heaves them back in the air , pelting the stars with spray
seven tripods never touched by fire , ten bars of gold , twenty burnished cauldrons , a dozen massive stallions , racers who earned me trophies with their speed
pouring cups to the gods , each warlord sought his shelter
he left them there for dead and just at the point where most battalions scattered agamemnon charged , the rest of his troops in armor quick behind him now , infantry killing infantry fleeing headlong , hard-pressed , drivers killing drivers — under the onrush dust in whirlwinds driven up from the plain , hoofs of stallions rumbling thunder , bronze flashing , immense slaughter and always king agamemnon whirling to kill , crying his argives on , breakneck on
once they had entered , allowed to appeal before the queen—the eldest , prince ilioneus , calm , composed , spoke out : your majesty , empowered by jove to found your new city here and curb rebellious tribes with your sense of justice—we poor trojans , castaways , tossed by storms over all the seas , we beg you : keep the cursed fire off our ships !
so the old king vowed — but you have destroyed his hopes
but the two launched out in flight and reaching ida with all her springs , mother of flocks , they found the thundering son of cronus seated high on gargaron peak , crowned with a fragrant cloud
you argives , you degraded — splendid in battle dress , pure sham !
dress his body in deathless , ambrosial robes
and you , the captain of craft and cunning , shrewd with greed !
that first , then seize the indestructible shield the god of fire gave you , ringed with gold
but zeus is with us here !
the whole world quaked , the slopes of ida with all her springs and all her peaks and the walls of troy and all achaea 's ships
out in the lead , pyrrhus seizes a double-axe and batters the rocky sill and ripping the bronze posts out of their sockets , hacking the rugged oaken planks of the doors , makes a breach , a gaping maw , and there , exposed , the heart of the house , the sweep of the colonnades , the palace depths of the old kings and priam lie exposed and they see the armed sentries bracing at the portals
not a thought for the many times i saved his son heracles , worked to death by the labors of eurystheus
but soon as achilles mustered all battalions , positioned in battle-order led by captains , he imposed this stern command on all his troops : myrmidons !
the men looked on in horror
ah , but to leave no hoofmarks pointing forward , into his cave he dragged them by the tail , turning their tracks backward— the pirate hid his plunder deep in his dark rocks
from there , headlong down with his full weight he plunged to the sea as a seahawk skims the waves , rounding the beaches , rounding cliffs to hunt for fish inshore
the white-armed goddess hera gave him voice : yes !
it ’ s your king , who renounced our pact of friendship , choosing to trust to turnus ’ force of arms
from their union springs the human race and the wild beasts , the winged lives of birds and the wondrous monsters bred below the glistening surface of the sea
but all the while the skies keep wheeling on and night comes sweeping in from the ocean stream , in its mammoth shadow swallowing up the earth , and the pole star , and the treachery of the greeks
ah would to god not one of them could escape his sudden plunging death beneath our hands !
that was nothing to how i hunger for you now — irresistible longing lays me low !
thousands , aeneas , and i will put you in command
listen to me , quickly !
so , two as they were , they slaughtered all her children
they armed for a raid , hoping to break the siege — loving wives and innocent children standing guard on the ramparts , flanked by elders bent with age as men marched out to war
agamemnon 's cry went piercing through the army : shame !
you were bent on trouble , whipping a howling killer-squall across the sea , bearing heracles off to the crowded town of cos , far from all his friends
then devoted aeneas , sword drawn , prays : now let the sun bear witness here and this , this land of italy that i call
then father anchises , stretching his hands toward the sea , cries out to the great powers , pledging them their due rites : gods , ward off these threats
but while the beaters scramble to ring the glens with nets , i ’ ll shower down a cloudburst , hail , black driving rain— i ’ ll shatter the vaulting sky with claps of thunder
at a stroke they all pitched into the work , dividing the labors , share and share alike , and bronze is running in rivers and flesh-tearing steel and gold ore melting down in the giant furnace
then as she breathes her last , she calls to acca , alone of her young comrades , more than all the others true to camilla , the only one with whom she shares her cares , and here is what she says : this far , acca , my sister , and i can go no further
so the wrath of the gods declares , the fresh-dug graves before latinus ’ eyes
and on he goes , cloaked in cloud—remarkable—right in their midst he blends in with the crowds , and no one sees him
the dawn was a red glow now , putting stars to flight as we glimpse the low-lying hills , dim in the distance
now caeculus , vulcan ’ s stock , and umbro fresh from the marsian highlands rally their troops as aeneas rages on against them
book twenty : olympian gods in arms
that fired their hearts with the fury of despair
and under a foaming wave her sisters dove as glistening-footed thetis soared toward olympus to win her dear son an immortal set of arms
there he writhed in pain but soon , encamped by the ships , the argives would recall philoctetes , their great king
i do not blame you
brutal jupiter hands it all over to greece , greeks are lording over our city up in flames
he was hector 's close comrade , born on the same night , but excelled at trading words as he at trading spear-thrusts
and i will surge on ahead , clearing the whole way for the teams ' assault — i will bend the argives back !
then back to my house i go—if only , only she ’ s gone there— but the greeks have flooded in , seized the entire place
well , there 's one , i trust , who will never yield to him !
but again i try , i tear at another stubborn stalk— i ’ ll probe this mystery to its hidden roots , and again the dark blood runs from the torn bark
and shipmates race each other , thrashing the waves , plunging along phaeacia ’ s mist-enshrouded heights to lose them far astern , skirting epirus ’ coasts , sailing into chaonia ’ s port and we finally reach the hilltop town , buthrotum
nor could i pass you by , cunarus , staunchest in war of all liguria ’ s chiefs , or you with your modest band of men , cupavo
this is more than i can bear , i tell you — to watch my son do battle with menelaus loved by the war-god , right before my eyes
he only spurned them , groaning , i beg you — if any comrade will hear me out in this — stop pressing me now to glut myself with food and drink , now such painful grief has come and struck my heart !
bronze the threshold crowning a flight of stairs , the doorposts sheathed in bronze , and the bronze doors groaned deep on their hinges
which way did she go ?
but odysseus , cool tactician , tried to calm him : achilles , son of peleus , greatest of the achaeans , greater than i , stronger with spears by no small edge — yet i might just surpass you in seasoned judgment by quite a lot , since i have years on you and i know the world much better
that 's what i propose
nothing to lift all spirits alike , i warn you
and the swift runner achilles answered warmly , ajax , royal son of telamon , captain of armies , all well said , after my own heart , or mostly so
the labor of battle would not let them , more labor urged by the god of the silver bow and man-destroying ares and strife flaring on , headlong on
and zeus let loose a huge crash of thunder from ida , hurling his bolts in a flash against achaea 's armies
you will hang your head if under the walls of troy the dogs in all their frenzy drag and maul the proud achilles ' steadfast friend
we are the closest to the dead , we will see to all things here
if you are going off to die , she begged , then take us with you too , to face the worst together
whipped with fear by their master 's threats they put on a fresh burst for a length or two but suddenly brave antilochus saw the narrow place where the road washed out — a sharp dip in the land where massing winter rains broke off the edge , making it all one sunken rut
but riding on with hector cebriones saw the trojan rout and shouted , hector !
i am not such a raw recruit , i like to think , born and bred on salamis
that ’ s the path to the stars— son of the gods , you ’ ll father gods to come !
and a hardy trojan would call on his side , friends !
or would you refuse me , always fuming against me because i defend the argives , you the trojans ?
the meeting grounds shook
with a wrenching groan you answered your friend , patroclus o my rider : achilles , son of peleus , greatest of the achaeans , spare me your anger , please — such heavy blows have overwhelmed the troops
no time for debate , and no dissent from acestes
in tears they gathered their gentle comrade 's white bones , all in a golden urn , sealed with a double fold of fat , and stowed the urn in his shelter , covered well with a light linen shroud , then laid his barrow out
i ’ m still stalked by the sight of terrifying omens
but all of a sudden , watch , with a ghastly swoop from the hills the harpies swarm us— ruffling , clattering wingbeats—ripping our food to bits , polluting it all with their foul , corrupting claws , their obscene shrieks bursting from the stench
wait — do not fling yourself in the grind of battle yet , not till you see me coming back with your own eyes
do not let me hear you boast in father 's halls , ever again , as you bragged among the gods till now , that you would fight poseidon strength for strength
we once had a king , aeneas
book ten : marauding through the night
grant us a sign , father , flow into our hearts !
and all the while aeneas calls on turnus to fight but the man is gone , so the many men who block his way he sends to death as juno ’ s winds are spinning turnus around in mid-sea and glancing backward , knowing nothing , no thanks for escape , he lifts his hands in prayer , his voice to the stars : almighty father , so , you find my guilt so great ?
the road won ’ t play us false
here was a man not sweet at heart , not kind , no , he was raging , wild — as tros grasped his knees , desperate , begging , achilles slit open his liver , the liver spurted loose , gushing with dark blood , drenched his lap and the night swirled down his eyes as his life breath slipped away
with that challenge he sprang from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground
his urgings fuel their fire : our situation is clear for all to see , and it needs no voice of ours in council now , my noble king
the last thing i would urge is to throw ourselves into battle
wildly as two winter torrents raging down from the mountains , swirling into a valley , hurl their great waters together , flash floods from the wellsprings plunging down in a gorge and miles away in the hills a shepherd hears the thunder — so from the grinding armies broke the cries and crash of war
let me clasp your hand , my father , let me— i beg you , don ’ t withdraw from my embrace !
the world went black as night before her eyes , she fainted , falling backward , gasping away her life breath
but they , as soon as the battlefield lay clear and level , charge at speed , rifling their spears at long range , then rush to battle with shields and clanging bronze
deadly going — then and there the trojans might have been rolled back , far away from the ships and tents to wind-torn troy if polydamas had not rushed to headstrong hector : impossible man !
but then — enraged for patroclus — brilliant achilles will bring prince hector down
like some lion that spots from his high lookout , far off on the plain and flexing for combat there , an immense bull , and the lion plunges toward his kill— and that is the image of turnus coming on for battle
true , unless my parents taught me to read the flight of birds for nothing
the opposing trojans fling down missiles , any and all , thrusting off the assault with rugged pikes—expert from their years of war at defending city ramparts
as long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger , the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
at once each struck his stance , up on his toes , fists raised high—not a twinge of fear now— heads rearing back , out of range of the fists , they mix punches , left , right , probe for openings , dares trusting to young blood and fancy footwork , entellus to brawn , to brute force , but his knees quake , his huge , lumbering frame is racked with labored breathing
then when the same chiefs had set aside their strife , they stood in full armor before jove ’ s holy altar , lifting cups , and slaughtered a sow to bind their pacts
he said no more
there great joy and a kingdom are yours to claim , and a queen to make your wife
and on he strode amidst his illustrious trojan allies — calling out with wild cries , now flashing before them all in the gleaming battle-gear of greathearted achilles
sick for their friend but what could they do ?
dearest to me of all my husband 's brothers — my husband , paris , magnificent as a god
and the one who proves the better man and wins , he will take those treasures fairly , lead the woman home
nor will aeneas ’ trojans ever revert in times to come , take up arms again and threaten to put this kingdom to the sword
down the plain he stormed like a stream in spate , a routing winter torrent sweeping away the dikes : the tight , piled dikes ca not hold it back any longer , banks shoring the blooming vineyards can not curb its course — a flash flood bursts as the rains from zeus pour down their power , acre on acre the well-dug work of farmers crumbling under it — so under tydides ' force the trojan columns panicked now , no standing their ground , massed , packed as they were
but tydeus treated them all to a shameful fate , finished them all but let one run for home , heeding the gods ' signs he let the hunter off
how willing you were !
latinus ’ urgings deflect the fury of turnus not one bit—it only surges higher
he was washed up on my shores , helpless , and i , i took him in , like a maniac let him share my kingdom , salvaged his lost fleet , plucked his crews from death
anchises ’ son came to a halt and stood there , pondering long , while pity filled his heart , their lot so hard , unjust
with that , he stirs the sentries and up they march to take their turn on watch
so the men fought on like a mass of whirling fire as swift antilochus raced the message toward achilles
even now the caspian and maeotic kingdoms quake at his coming , oracles sound the alarm and the seven mouths of the nile churn with fear
we can have no idea , no clear idea at all how the long campaign will end
all in battle-order drive them past patroclus — a cortege will mourn the man with teams and chariots
but now at last , stop , achilles — let your heart-devouring anger go !
but the will of zeus will always overpower the will of men , zeus who strikes fear in even the bravest man of war and tears away his triumph , all in a lightning flash , and at other times he will spur a man to battle
flies at him , looming over him , high in the saddle to strike him dead with his rugged beamy lance , the king begging for mercy , messapus shouting : this one ’ s finished !
but he wo not save you now , i would say — though the hope goes racing through your mind
it 's your own command still ringing in my ears , forbidding me to fight the immortals head-on , all but one of the blessed gods , that is — if aphrodite daughter of zeus slips into battle , she 's the one to stab with my sharp bronze spear
trusting so to your lofty birth ?
your father , remember , was no man of mercy
bow to my appeals
achilles never treated his enemy priam so
vast treasures are piled up in antimachus ' house , bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron — father would give you anything , gladly , priceless ransom if only he learns we are still alive in argive ships !
how can you sleep all night , a man weighed down with duties ?
yet even if other teams are faster , look at their drivers : there 's not a trick in their whips that you do not have at hand
torn in spirit , dido will not dissolve into sleep—her eyes , her mind won ’ t yield tonight
let this mission challenge all our children
still , the immortals loved prince hector dearly , best of all the mortals born in troy
they rushed to obey him , some swarming over the top at once , others streaming in through the sturdy gateways — argives scattering back in terror , back by the hollow hulls , the uproar rising , no way out , no end —
gladly , the rite performed , i unfold the whole event to anchises , point by point
a snake , and his back streaked red with blood , a thing of terror !
drivers , rein your horses hard by the trench — the men themselves , armed for assault on foot , we all follow hector , all in a mass attack
and the joint of his left shoulder ached with labor , forever bracing his huge burnished shield rock-steady , but they could not wrench it loose from round his body for all their pelting weapons
pitch himself at the swords and die at once ?
and deep within its walls were fifty sleeping chambers masoned in smooth , lustrous ashlar , linked in a line where the sons of priam slept beside their wedded wives , and facing these , opening out across the inner courtyard , lay the twelve sleeping chambers of priam 's daughters , masoned and roofed in lustrous ashlar , linked in a line where the sons-in-law of priam slept beside their wives
a prize to match the exploit !
but the gods forbid you to take creusa with you , bound from troy together
what age has been so blest to give you birth ?
but no gall in achilles
and the sea heaved in joy , cleaving a path for him and the team flew on in a blurring burst of speed , the bronze axle under the war-car never flecked with foam , the stallions vaulting , speeding poseidon toward achaea 's fleet
from now on , dido cares no more for appearances , nor for her reputation , either
he has more power than you , by far , but give him sound advice , guide him , even in battle
but hades made his way to craggy olympus , climbed to the house of zeus , stabbed with agony , grief-struck to the heart , the shaft driven into his massive shoulder grinding down his spirit
try hard , do better this time — bring your charioteer back home alive to his waiting argive comrades once we are through with fighting
who can stand against you ?
but soon as tydides followed up his spear , tracking its flight far down along the front where it stuck in sand , hector caught his breath and boarding his car , drove for his own main force as he hurtled clear of the dark fates of death — diomedes shouting after him , shaking his spear , now , again , you have escaped your death , you dog , but a good close brush with death it was , i would say !
under the sodden beams the tow still smolders , reeking a slow , heavy smoke that creeps along the keels , the ruin eating into the hulls , and all their heroic efforts , showering water , get them nowhere
where will you drive me next ?
the final hours of troy silence
ulysses would not tolerate such an outrage , always true to himself when it ’ s life-or-death
and there at the palace hector 's mother met her son , that warm , goodhearted woman , going in with laodice , the loveliest daughter hecuba ever bred
we press him : tell us where you were born , your family
but nothing could make him panic — no green boy , he stood his ground like a wild mountain boar , trusting his strength , standing up to a rout of men that scream and swoop against him off in a lonely copse , the ridge of his back bristling , his eyes flashing fire , he grinds his teeth , champing to beat back dogs and men
both were gods of the same line , a single father , but zeus was the elder-born and zeus knew more
the almighty father hurled his bolt through the thunderheads— no torches for him , no smoky flicker of pitch-pines , no , he spun him headlong down in a raging whirlwind
but achaea 's armies came on strong in silence , breathing combat-fury , hearts ablaze to defend each other to the death
his feet turned to the door , stretched out for burial , round him comrades mourning
aeneas grips it at once—the bough holds back— he tears it off in his zeal and bears it into the vatic sibyl ’ s shrine
i have an age-old tract along the tiber river , stretching west , beyond the sicanian border
but if victory grants our force-in-arms the day , as i think she may—may the gods decree it so— i shall not command italians to bow to trojans , nor do i seek the scepter for myself
range the achaean ranks , with your winning words hold back each man you find — do not let them haul their rolling ships to sea !
and i am aeneas , and i can boast anchises ' blood , the proud anchises , but my mother is aphrodite
the channels of all those rivers — apollo swung them round into one mouth and nine days hurled their flood against the wall and zeus came raining down , cloudburst powering cloudburst , the faster to wash that rampart out to open sea
too well i know how my people ’ s savage hatred swirls around me
as diomedes was stripping strong agastrophus bare , tearing the burnished breastplate off his victim 's chest , the shield from his shoulders and heavy crested helmet , paris , clenching the grip and drawing back his bow , shot !
dismiss your grief and fear
but high in his stronghold aeolus wields his scepter , soothing their passions , tempering their fury
did hector never burn in your honor thighs of oxen and flawless , full-grown goats ?
— or the death of my dear son , reared for me in scyros , if prince neoptolemus is still among the living
at least in death i ’ ll find a peaceful haven
lusting to lure me to my ruin yet again ?
no truce till one or the other falls and gluts with blood ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield
mnestheus , fierce serestus , both come rushing in and seeing their ranks in panic , ranks of enemies lodged inside the gates , mnestheus shouts out : where are you heading ?
curse to your father , your city and all your people , a joy to our enemies , rank disgrace to yourself !
ah to a cruel fate i bore you in our halls !
my dear comrade 's dead — patroclus — the man i loved beyond all other comrades , loved as my own life — i have lost him — hector 's killed him , stripped the gigantic armor off his back , a marvel to behold — my burnished gear !
all the argives flying home to their fatherland , sailing over the sea 's broad back ?
please , help me to bathe her wounds in water now , and if any last , lingering breath still hovers , let me catch it on my lips
as he thought it out , the first way seemed the best
come , listen well to another man
nine years i lived with both , forging bronze by the trove , elegant brooches , whorled pins , necklaces , chokers , chains — there in the vaulted cave — and round us ocean 's currents swirled in a foaming , roaring rush that never died
and now you threaten to strip me of my prize in person — the one i fought for long and hard , and sons of achaea handed her to me
we live in shady groves , we settle on pillowed banks and meadows washed with brooks
let 's wake others also , diomedes famed for his spear , odysseus , quick little ajax and phyleus ' brave son
now see to menelaus , achaea 's fighting captain
apollo hurled fear in their hearts and handed hector and all his trojans instant glory
he demands his team and arms at once , in a flash of pride he leaps up onto his chariot , tugging hard on the reins and races on and droves of the brave he hands to death and tumbles droves of the half-dead down to earth or crushes whole detachments under his wheels or seizing their lances , cuts down all who cut and run
a whole army of men arriving out of the same quarter , bent on the same goal , to rule our city ’ s heights !
how her golden brooch binds up her hair—how she cradles a lycian quiver , her shepherd ’ s staff of myrtle spiked with steel
a suppliant now , his fresh cheeks and his strong young body pallid
diomedes just drew back beside his car and team and stood there calling sthenelus , capaneus ' son : quick , sthenelus
first , tall hector with helmet flashing led the trojans — priam 's son and in his command by far the greatest , bravest army , divisions harnessed in armor , veterans bristling spears
but you , have you just come from the tall ships ?
if die i must , death at the hands of men will be a joy !
you report my message — since this is the privilege of senior chiefs — let them work out a better plan of action , use their imaginations now to save the ships and achaea 's armies pressed to their hollow hulls
if my heart had not been fixed , dead set against embracing another man in the bonds of marriage— ever since my first love deceived me , cheated me by his death—if i were not as sick as i am of the bridal bed and torch , this , perhaps , is my one lapse that might have brought me down
while juno harangued the gods with her appeals , all were murmuring low , assenting , dissenting
now you would better plan how to save your city , you alone and your native troopers born in troy
the trojans never did me damage , not in the least , they never stole my cattle or my horses , never in phthia where the rich soil breeds strong men did they lay waste my crops
so now not even seasoned aeneas ' heavy shaft could smash achilles ' shield : the gold blocked it , forged in the god 's gift
but we , we forged ahead , oblivious , blind , insane , we stationed the monster fraught with doom on the hallowed heights of troy
what new course do we set ?
furious , struggling to tear the broken arrowhead out , he insists they take the quickest way to heal him : cut the wound with a broadsword , open it wide , dig out the point where it ’ s bedded deep and put me back into action !
hera 's challenge — and goddess athena , her eyes afire , could not resist
he cries , you and your vicious crimes !
nor do the proud commands of jove escape me now , our great , warm-hearted jove
you are talking to argive men who know my record
first hecamede pushed a table up toward them , handsome , sanded smooth , with blue enamel legs , and on it she set a basket , braided in bronze with onions in it , a relish for the drink , and pale gold honey along with barley meal , the grain 's blessed yield
now guide us again , athena , guide us against that thracian camp and horses !
— still in my senses , true , but a harrowed , broken man marked out by doom — past the threshold of old age
a doddering wreck too spent to see the truth ?
and then the heart of poseidon quaked with anger — his own grandson brought down in the bloody charge
but , oh dear gods , what slaughter threatens the poor laurentine people !
so now , if any lycian troops will obey my orders , home we go — and headlong death can come and topple troy
too many falling , day after day — battalions !
i will grant achilles glory and so safeguard your awe and love of me for all the years to come
but if go you must , pray , at least , to the great god of the dark storm cloud , up there on ida , gazing down on the whole expanse of troy !
there-aeneas replied in kind and killed two argive captains , diodes ' two sons , orsilochus flanking crethon
the whole army ’ s on guard , tense along the walls
just look , one woman crushed by the craft of two gods !
it 's offensive — this is not the time
and he forged a king 's estate where harvesters labored , reaping the ripe grain , swinging their whetted scythes
a high decree of the father must not come to nothing — whatever he commands
his son is dead in battle , his dearest son , ascalaphus — does not invincible ares claim to be his father ?
until they are battling round your well-built gates ?
as pallas , evander , all of them rise before aeneas ’ eyes , the welcoming board that met him that first day , the right hands clasped in trust— and four sons of sulmo , fighters all , and the same number reared by ufens : aeneas takes them alive to offer pallas ’ shade and soak his flaming pyre with captive blood
then he seized the royal scepter of his fathers — its power can never die — and grasping it tightly off he strode to the ships of argives armed in bronze
he hacks polydorus down and commandeers the gold
the armies took their seats , marshaled into ranks
tychius made it for him , laboring long , the finest leather-smith by far : over in hyle where the master had his home he crafted that famous gleaming shield for ajax , layering seven welted hides of sturdy well-fed bulls and hammered an eighth layer of bronze to top it off
go to sleep now , full to your heart 's content with food and wine , a soldier 's strength and nerve
aeneas ’ ship ’ s in the lead , with phrygian lions fixed on her beak , mount ida looming aloft , a god-sent sign of home to trojan exiles
but let him go alone , no other trojan attend him , only a herald with him , a seasoned , older one who can drive the mules and smooth-running wagon and bring the hero 's body back to sacred troy , the man that brilliant achilles killed in battle
the father accepted the sacrifices , true , but doubled the weight of thankless , ruthless war
but the greek commanders and agamemnon ’ s troops in phalanx , spotting the hero and his armor glinting through the shadows— blinding panic grips them , some turn tail and run as they once ran back to the ships , some strain to raise a battle cry , a thin wisp of a cry that mocks their gaping jaws
think of it : paris and menelaus loved by ares go to fight it out with their rugged spears — all for you — and the man who wins that duel , you will be called his wife !
phoebus , masking his voice like priam 's son lycaon , like him to the life the son of zeus called out , captain of trojan councils — where have they gone , those threats you made in your cups before the kings ?
withdraw to your main lines and wait him there , out of the crash of battle
i too could battle the deathless gods with words — it 's hard with a spear , the gods are so much stronger
some message from phthia that you alone have heard ?
then he would never have finished last of all
suddenly paris hurled — his spear 's long shadow flew and the shaft hit menelaus ' round shield , full center — not pounding through , the brazen point bent back in the tough armor
but here mezentius comes , brandishing high his massive spear and storming on like a whirlwind down the plain , and enormous as orion marching in mid-sea , plowing a path through the deep swells , his shoulders rearing over the waves , or hauling down from a ridge the trunk of an age-old mountain ash , as he treads the ground he hides his head in clouds— so vast , mezentius marching on in gigantic armor
but hector , his helmet flashing , never flinched : do not think for a moment , achilles , son of peleus , you can frighten me with words like a child , a fool — i am an old hand myself at trading taunts and insults
you trojans who stole away my wedded wife and hoards of riches too — for no reason , none — my queen of the realm who hosted you with kindness
night comes rushing down , embracing the earth in its deep dark wings
why , just now she plucked him away , she saved his life when he thought his end had come
why do i shrink from my decision ?
back to its well-known home the wounded creature fled , struggled into its stall and groaning , bleeding , filling the long halls with cries of pain , it seemed to plead for help
but if zeus allows you to kill off all the trojans , drive them out of my depths at least , i ask you , out on the plain and do your butchery there
the tale ’ s not failed—as you imagine—to reach my ears
but first he called his ranking chiefs to council beside the ship of nestor , the warlord born in pylos
time and again my fiery spirit drove me to win a wife , a fine partner to please my heart , to enjoy with her the treasures my old father peleus piled high
no , i must return to the ocean 's running stream , the aethiopians ' land
no one here 's in the grip of bloodless fear , collapsing in cowardice , ducking the grim assault
our glory 's gone if we fall back now on the ships — let the black earth gape and take us all at once , here and now !
but topping all your gifts , i beg you , just one more
with that , with destiny made clear , he left him there on the spot and turning back to achilles quickly brushed away the mist from his eyes , the magic , godsent haze
come now , let 's both put up a tripod or a cauldron , wager which horses are really out in front and we will make atrides agamemnon our referee — you will learn , do not worry , once you pay the price !
towering cliffs fling out their arms like steep twin walls and the temple rests securely back from shore
there lies our true home
then he eases his friends ’ and anxious iulus ’ fears , explaining the ways of fate , commanding envoys now to return his firm reply to king latinus , state the terms of peace
he , like a headland jutting into the ocean wastes and bared to the winds ’ rage , braving the breakers , weathering out all force and fury of sea and sky , stands firm himself
but achilles kept on grieving for his friend , the memory burning on
and now from all sides an enormous uproar , cries in conflict lift on the winds— like cries of bird-flocks landing in some tall grove by chance or swans with their hoarse calls clamoring out across the sounding pools of padusa river stocked with fish
his place , eastwind , is the rough rocks where you are all at home
and suddenly as they flew , the amasenus overflowed , look , foaming over its banks , such violent cloudbursts broke
nor do her trojan comrades tarry
so , he sought out italy under the fates ’ command ?
androgeos leading a horde of troops and taking us for allies on the march , the fool , he even gives us a warm salute and calls out : hurry up , men
haunting the fighting , are you ?
overawed by the king 's majestic scorn
at the first charge he slashed his right nipple , clean through the shoulder went the brazen point and down in the dust he fell like a lithe black poplar shot up tall and strong in the spreading marshy flats , the trunk trimmed but its head a shock of branches
the earth groans as stroke after stroke they land with naked swords : fortune and fortitude mix in one assault
go back to him , mother , stroke the father with soft , winning words — at once the olympian will turn kind to us again
achilles next , he leapt at prince agenor — but phoebus refused to let him seize the glory — he whisked agenor off , wrapped in swirls of mist and sped him out of the fighting safely on his way and then with trickery kept achilles off the trojans
athena 's own hand deflected it down the belt where the gold buckles clasp and breastplates overlap
around him , heaps of dead , and among them old galaesus killed as he set himself in their midst to beg for peace , the most righteous man in all the italian fields , long ago , the richest too
never set foot again on mount olympus , never !
there was a secret door , a hidden passage linking the wings of priam ’ s house—remote , far to the rear
have not you got enough to wail about at home without coming here to add to all my griefs ?
but once he would passed it round and reached the man who had scratched the stone and thrown it in the helmet — ajax bent on glory — out went his hand to take it , the herald pausing beside him dropped it in and ajax knew his mark and thrilled to see it , flung it down at his feet and shouted , friends — the lot is mine and it fills my heart with joy !
nothing , no reply , and again creusa !
but the skin of the brave soldier never blanches
who drove from the ships such raging fire ?
they never thought they would fight free of death
cupid leaps at once to his loving mother ’ s orders
next turnus buckles round his shoulders the breastplate , dense with its golden mesh and livid mountain bronze , and straps on sword , shield , and helmet with horns for its bloody crest—that sword the fire-god forged for father daunus , plunged red-hot in the river styx
and the same anguish shook menelaus too — no sleep could settle over his eyes , not now
sing to me now , you muses who hold the halls of olympus !
at that , priam , trapped in the grip of death , not holding back , not checking his words , his rage : you !
i am on my way over there to meet this new assault — i will soon be back , once i have helped our friends
stepping back from the pyre he prayed to the two winds — zephyr and boreas , west and north — promised splendid victims and pouring generous , brimming cups from a golden goblet , begged them to come , so the wood might burst in flame and the dead burn down to ash with all good speed
do not bow to a soldier 's rank , an eye to his birth — even if he 's more kingly
and now as trojan aeneas , gazing in awe at all the scenes of troy , stood there , spellbound , eyes fixed on the war alone , the queen aglow with beauty approached the temple , dido , with massed escorts marching in her wake
no trojans could save him now , strain as they might — ajax son of telamon charging quickly into the carnage speared him at close range through the bronze-cheeked helmet , the horsehair crest cracked wide open around the point , smashed by the massive spear and hand that drove it
and king agamemnon , thrilled to see that sight , sped them on with a rousing flight of praises : ajax — ajax !
into the center lines juturna strides , alert to the work at hand , and she sows a variety of rumors , urging : aren ’ t you ashamed , rutulians , putting at risk the life of one to save us all ?
no nation on earth will match the honors they shower down on you
her voice rang out in tears and vast throngs wailed and old king priam rose and gave his people orders : now , you men of troy , haul timber into the city !
i will go after pallas , pallas is mine now , my prize alone
so the heart inside your chest is never daunted
quickly the long-haired achaeans took their meal throughout the shelters , then they armed at once
the rousing rumor of war had carried far as cyprus — how the achaean ships were launching war on troy — so he gave the king that gear to please his spirit
so he cried and his outcry stirred in them all a deep desire to grieve , and dawn with her rose-red fingers shone upon them weeping round the wretched corpse
i wish i were as surely the son of storming zeus for all my days — and noble hera gave me birth and i were prized as they prize athena and apollo — as surely as this day will bring your argives death , down to the last man
the more he gloried , the more grief swept the argives , brave antilochus most , his battle-passion rising , stunned with pain but he would not fail hypsenor
but crowding round her now her husband 's sisters and brothers ' wives supported her in their midst , and she , terrified , stunned to the point of death , struggling for breath now and coming back to life , burst out in grief among the trojan women : o hector — i am destroyed !
and the noble son of anchises led the dardanians — aeneas whom the radiant aphrodite bore anchises down the folds of ida , a goddess bedded with a man
that ’ s all he says
i will go with you , your comrade
rushing back to the palace turnus calls for his team and thrills to see them neighing right before him , gifts from orithyia herself to glorify pilumnus , horses whiter than snow , swifter than racing winds
so he decreed and thetis with her glistening feet did not resist a moment
there you have my lineage
and roan beauty the horse with flashing hoofs spoke up from under the yoke , bowing his head low so his full mane came streaming down the yoke-pads , down along the yoke to sweep the ground
and now the giant fighter would summon up his fury , wheeling on them again , beating off platoons of the stallion-breaking trojans — and now again he would swerve around in flight
dodging the big spear , aeneas got to his feet
even achilles dreads to pit himself against him out on the battle lines where men win glory — achilles , far and away a stronger man than you
and the giant ajax got to his feet at once , odysseus stood up too , an expert at every subtle , cunning hold
as for the gifts , let the king of men agamemnon have the lot of them hauled amidst our muster , so all the troops can see the trove themselves and you , achilles , you can warm your heart
now we are swept away , iphitus , pelias with me , one weighed down with age and the other slowed by a wound ulysses gave him—heading straight for priam ’ s palace , driven there by the outcries
— is this the man who mustered the oarsmen once , who braved the seas in his racing deep-sea ships , trafficked with outlanders , carried off a woman far from her distant shores , a great beauty wed to a land of rugged spearmen ?
even if twenty hectors had charged against me — they would all have died here , laid low by my spear
the great blockade is over
but again , still bent on glory , hector mustered his trojan cohorts , pulled them back from the ships toward the river rapids , to wide open ground where they found a sector free and clear of corpses
but zeus drew hector out of range of the weapons , out of the dust storm , out of the mounting kills , the blood and rout of war as atrides followed hard , shouting his argives on , furious , never stopping
agamemnon leapt to his feet and hurled his threat — his threat 's been driven home
a great curse olympian zeus let live and grow in him , for troy and high-hearted priam and all his sons
there the fire-god forged them , well aware of the seers and schooled in times to come , all in order the generations born of ascanius ’ stock and all the wars they waged
but no tears move aeneas now
and no god on high , none is to blame so much as my dear mother — how she lied , she beguiled me , she promised me i would die beneath the walls of the armored trojans , cut down in blood by apollo 's whipping arrows !
he mounted again and flogged the horses hard and on they flew to the ships , holding nothing back — that 's where their spirits drove them on to go
the next battalion was led by fighting eudorus , born out of wedlock too
and zeus the son of cronus bowed his craggy dark brows and the deathless locks came pouring down from the thunderhead of the great immortal king and giant shock waves spread through all olympus
but the distant deadly archer volleyed back , god of the earthquake — you would think me hardly sane if i fought with you for the sake of wretched mortals
their horses will never sweep them clear of us , not both men , though one or the other may escape
taunting so , and steadfast diomedes offered no reply
hector loosed a piercing cry at his men : drive , drive , my stallion-breaking trojans !
first he finishes abas , quick to face him there : that burly knot , that bulwark of battle
that was my first step on the slippery road to ruin
i will gladly swear your oath — the spirit moves me now — nor will i break that oath in the eyes of any god
diana ’ s her only passion
each man to his own best hope , but now you can see how slim your hopes have been
nestor the noble horseman led with questions : tell me , odysseus , achaea 's pride and glory , famous odysseus , how did you get these horses ?
but it brought no joy to the heart of agamemnon , our high and mighty king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears
but aeneas , the great commander , hearing the name of turnus , deserts the walls , deserts the citadel ’ s heights and breaks off all operations , jettisons all delay— he springs in joy , drums his shield and it thunders terror
and across the trench he drove the purebred team with a rough exultant laugh as comrades cheered , crowding in his wake
some spears that flew from the trojans ' hardy arms , hurtling forward , stuck fast in his huge shield but showers of others , cut short halfway before they could graze his gleaming skin , stuck in the ground , still lusting to sink in flesh
out with it now !
then and there he unstrapped his polished bow , the horn of a wild goat he would shot in the chest one day as the springy ibex clambered down a cliff
the racer in all his glory just stood there , clutching one of the beast 's horns , spitting out the dung and sputtering to his comrades , foul , by heaven !
a silver bowl , gorgeous , just six measures deep but the finest mixing bowl in all the world
no sooner said than , moving on , he points out the altar of carmentis , then the carmental gate as the romans call it : an ancient tribute paid to the nymph carmentis , seer who told the truth , the first to foresee the greatness of aeneas ’ sons and pallanteum ’ s fame to come
the fates will find the way
a hundred other maids and a hundred men , all matched in age , are spreading the feast on trestles , setting out the cups
now erichthonius sired tros , a lord of the trojans , and tros , in turn , had three distinguished sons : ilus , assaracus and ganymede radiant as a god , and he was the handsomest mortal man on earth — and so the immortals , awestruck by his beauty , snatched him away to bear the cup of zeus and pour out wine for all the deathless gods
but his sister artemis , huntress , queen of beasts , inveighed against him now with stinging insults : so , the deadly immortal archer runs for dear life !
while into the melee hurry lucagus and his brother liger , chariot-borne by two white steeds , the brother reinsman guiding the team as lucagus flaunts his naked steel
i am the greater king , i am the elder-born , i claim — the greater man
but packed in a mass the trojans came on pounding , hector leading the way with long , leaping strides and heading the van in person came the god apollo , shoulders wrapped in cloud , gripping the storm-shield , the tempest terror , dazzling , tassels flaring along its front — the bronzesmith god of fire gave it to zeus to bear and strike fear in men and apollo gripped it now , locked in his two fists as he led the trojans on
when men dread that , more men come through alive — when soldiers break and run , good-bye glory , good-bye all defenses !
and i hear his urgings ringing in my ears : 'always be the best , my boy , the bravest , and hold your head up high above the others
if only he would offer one last gift to the wretched queen who loves him : to wait for fair winds , smooth sailing for his flight !
this order still on his lips , apollo vanished from sight into empty air
and all ranks of achaeans cried out their assent : respect the priest , accept the shining ransom !
the harder he cried the harder his forces charged against the argives
we have not come to put your libyan gods and homes to the sword , loot them and haul our plunder toward the beach
apollo the archer , finding his birthplace drifting shore to shore , like a proper son had chained it fast to myconos ’ steep coast and gyaros , made it stable , a home for men that scorns the winds ’ assaults
she is the one who supports the trojan forces , not their own strong hands that clutch for combat , not their unflinching spirits seasoned hard to peril
the best by far of the teams were eumelus ' mares and pheres ' grandson drove them — swift as birds , matched in age and their glossy coats and matched to a builder 's level flat across their backs
explode in a burst of fire !
a flash of a lance — hector hurled at automedon who kept his eyes right on him , dodged the bronze , ducking down with a quick lunge , and behind his back the heavy spearshaft plunged and stuck in the earth , the butt end quivering into the air till suddenly rugged ares snuffed its fury out , dead still
march out on your mission , bravest chief of the trojans , now the italians too
all of them , all our best in the old campaigns are laid up in the hulls , they are hit by arrows , pierced by spears , brought down by trojan hands while the trojans ' power keeps on rising , rising !
he ’ s setting his own squadrons between their closing forces now
i am afraid he may be hurt , alone with the trojans , brave as odysseus is — a blow to all our troops
fight like men , my friends , call up your battle-fury — make for the hollow ships !
no fame , no memory to be won for punishing a woman : such victory reaps no praise but to stamp this abomination out as she deserves , to punish her now , they ’ ll sing my praise for that
the great mother pitied us , changed our shape , she made us goddesses , yes , and so we pass our lives beneath the waves
but king agamemnon answered him in haste , true , old man — all you say is fit and proper — but this soldier wants to tower over the armies , he wants to rule over all , to lord it over all , give out orders to every man in sight
quick as the wind the goddess had a plan : we know — we too — they hold your famous armor
that ’ s hardly the man that pandarus and bitias met when those two giants confronted me— and the thousand men whom i , in a single day , sent down to hell in all my triumph , trapped as i was inside the enemy ’ s rugged walls
i ’ ll explain in a word or so
seven tripods hauled from the tents , as promised , twenty burnished cauldrons , a dozen massive stallions
what do you want ?
zeus the son of almighty cronus , i remind you , bowed his head that day we boarded ship , all the argives laden with blood and death for troy — his lightning bolts on the right , good omens blazing forth
troy has fallen—and fallen let her stay— with the very name of troy !
hector seethed in anger — his hurtling spear and his whole arm 's power poured in a wasted shot — and back in his massing ranks he shrank , dodging death
step right up , just come this way—to die !
now i will tell you what seems best to me
for nine whole days the immortals have been feuding over hector 's corpse and achilles scourge of cities
following step by step the fighting menelaus strapped on armor too
the men of troy will erect a city for me— lavinia will give its walls her name
at once menestheus sped a herald to ajax : run for it , quick one , call great ajax here — both of them , better yet , that 's best of all
god of the earthquake , you with your massive power , why are you moaning so ?
all the worse for him — if achilles wants to venture forth from the fleet , fight us round our walls
later you can mourn your beloved son once more , when you bear him home to troy , and you will weep many tears
but my heart still heaves with rage whenever i call to mind that arrogance of his — how he mortified me , right in front of the argives — that son of atreus treating me like some vagabond , like some outcast stripped of all my rights !
no small voice in the public councils , always a shrewd adviser , a power in party strife
then in a blur of kills , amphoterus , erymas , epaltes , tlepolemus son of damastor , and echius and pyris , ipheus and euippus and polymelus the son of argeas — he crowded corpse on corpse on the earth that rears us all
just don ’ t commit your words to the rustling , scattering leaves— sport of the winds that whirl them all away
enraged at his friend 's death odysseus sprang in fury , helmed in fiery bronze he plowed through the front and charging the enemy , glaring left and right he hurled his spear — a glinting brazen streak — and the trojans gave ground , scattering back , panicking there before his whirling shaft — a direct hit !
and just coming in range , just closing on each other
whirling it round the fighter sent it flying into his argives scrambling fast to retrieve it — back at his man he sprang , enraged with brazen spear , mad for the kill but aphrodite snatched paris away , easy work for a god , wrapped him in swirls of mist and set him down in his bedroom filled with scent
as long as brilliant achilles stalked the front no trojan would ever venture beyond the dardan gates , they were so afraid of the man 's tremendous spear
so— so—i rejoice to make my way among the shades
just think , you are to die by the arrows of diana !
so now , menelaus , the fresh blood went staining down your sturdy thighs , your shins and well-turned ankles
but destiny guided amphius on , a comrade sworn to the cause of priam and all of priam 's sons
but we , your own children , the ones you swore would hold the battlements of heaven—now our ships are lost , appalling !
that 's why a fighter prays for kin in his halls , blood kin to survive and avenge his death in battle !
ajax strode on , closing , bearing his huge body-shield like a rampart , heavy bronze over seven layers of oxhide
enough of your threats !
you say you ’ re achilles ’ son ?
while hector still lived and achilles raged on and the warlord priam 's citadel went unstormed , so long the achaeans ' rampart stood erect
but enter this man-killing war without the gifts — your fame will flag , no longer the same honor , even though you hurl the trojans home !
hector , tearing the famous armor off patroclus , tugged hard at the corpse , mad to hack the head from the neck with bronze and drag the trunk away to glut the dogs of troy
so the illustrious son of priam begged for life but only heard a merciless voice in answer : fool , do not talk to me of ransom
but now , look , brilliant achilles courses him round the city of priam in all his savage , lethal speed
here cretan rhadamanthus rules with an iron hand , censuring men , exposing fraud , forcing confessions when anyone up above , reveling in his hidden crimes , puts off his day of atonement till he dies , the fool , too late
but if you are on fire , overflowing with passion , there 's always your own bedroom
you are both younger than i , and in my time i struck up with better men than you , even you , but never once did they make light of me
perhaps — who knows ?
that 's just a gift of god
share and share alike the hoards our handsome citadel stores within its depths and — why debate , my friend ?
bear witness , altar and those infernal knives that i escaped and the sacred bands i wore myself : the victim
the people know , they admit they know what destiny has in store , but they flinch from speaking out
lost , i was leaving behind familiar paths , at a run down blind dead ends when— oh dear god , my wife , creusa— torn from me by a brutal fate !
wait , come , my guest , she urges , tell us your own story , start to finish—the ambush laid by the greeks , the pain your people suffered , the wanderings you have faced
wretched women of troy , it ’ s not the enemy camp , the greeks—you ’ re burning your own best hopes !
with those words she had climbed the pyre ’ s topmost steps and now , clasping her dying sister to her breast , fondling her she sobbed , stanching the dark blood with her own gown
suddenly , misenus—out on the dry beach they see him , reach him now , cut off by a death all undeserved
watch : the virgin daughter of priam , cassandra , torn from the sacred depths of minerva ’ s shrine , dragged by the hair , raising her burning eyes to the heavens , just her eyes , so helpless , shackles kept her from raising her gentle hands
silvius , your son , your last-born , when late in your old age your wife lavinia brings him up , deep in the woods—a king who fathers kings in turn , he founds our race that rules in alba longa
they say the captain , rushing headlong on to harness his team and board his car to begin the duel , left his father ’ s sword behind and hastily grabbed his charioteer metiscus ’ blade
so now the heart of sarpedon stalwart as a god impelled him to charge the wall and break it down
arriving , he finds the queen already poised on a golden throne beneath the sumptuous hangings , commanding the very center of her palace
teucer , your enemy , often sang troy ’ s praises , claiming his own descent from teucer ’ s ancient stock
one mother bore them all , a tuscan , loyal tyrrhena wed to gylippus , her arcadian husband
so venus makes an appeal to love , her winged son : you , my son , are my strength , my greatest power— you alone , my son , can scoff at the lightning bolts the high and mighty father hurled against typhoeus
helmet flashing , hector wheeled with a dark glance : no more , polydamas !
have they entitled him to hurl abuse at me ?
with those bleak words queen hera took her seat
i myself will lead you between my banks , upstream , making your way against the current under oars— i ’ ll speed you on your journey
flinging cries as a screaming gust of the northwind pounds against his sail , raising waves sky-high
first , that italian land you think so near— all unknowing , planning to ease into its harbors— lies far off
and as for the gifts you bring me from your homeland , give them to aeneas
i heard a voice of the gods who live forever
and atrides led the way and ajax took his lead , striding on like a god until they found odysseus dear to zeus but round him trojans thronged like tawny jackals up in the mountains swarming round a horned stag just wounded — a hunter 's hit him with one fast shaft from his bow and the stag 's escaped , sprinting at top speed so long as his blood runs warm and the spring in his knees still lasts
what kings were fired for war , what armies at their orders thronged the plains ?
but you , thoas , you who were always rock-steady in battle and braced the ones you saw go slack and flinch — do not quit now , thoas , urge each man you find !
he was the one who brought me here to troy — oh how i wish i would died before that day !
look down then , if you have the taste for it , hera , and you will see the towering son of cronus killing still more hordes , whole armies of argive soldiers
helios , sun above us , you who see all , hear all things !
that said , the terrible goddess swooped down to the earth and stirred allecto , mother of sorrows , up from her den where nightmare furies lurk in hellish darkness
now one thing 's certain — your own headlong death !
never — even if zeus 's wrath does not strike home at once , he will strike in his own good time with greater fury
where to begin , what opening ?
but you do not press on and reach a useful end
now through troy the heralds brought the offerings for the gods , sacred victims to bind and seal the oaths : two lambs and the wine that warms the heart , the yield of the vine , filling a goatskin sack , and the herald idaeus carried a gleaming bowl and golden winecups
they found him with all his gear outside his shelter , cohorts sleeping round him , shields beneath their heads , spears stuck straight in the ground on butt-end spikes and the bronze points flashing into the distance like forked lightning flung by father zeus
the trojans slept on , strewn throughout their fortress , weary bodies embraced by slumber
he fell with a crash , his armor clanging round him
but the two of you , if only a god could make you stand fast yourselves , tense with all your power , and command the rest of your men to stand fast too — then you could hurl him back from the deep-sea ships , hard as he hurls against you , even if zeus himself impels the madman on
so no less swiftly aeneas strides forward now and his face shines with a glory like the god ’ s
their master leapt down from the bright burnished car , propped his whip on the yoke
so he prodded and diomedes woke from sleep with a quick start and burst of winging words : a hard man you are , old soldier — hard
but never fear delay , though crewmen press you hard and the course you set calls out to your sails to take the waves , and you could fill those sails with good fair winds
just nearing the camp , just coming up to the earthworks when they spot at a distance two men swerving off to the left
hercules heard the young man ’ s prayer , suppressed a groan that rose up from his heart , and wept helpless tears as the father said these tender words to his son : each man has his day , and the time of life is brief for all , and never comes again
so they cried to the king , cries for mercy , but only heard a merciless voice in answer : cunning antimachus !
once anchises has led his son through each new scene and fired his soul with a love of glory still to come , he tells him next of the wars aeneas still must wage , he tells of laurentine peoples , tells of latinus ’ city , and how he should shun or shoulder each ordeal that he must meet
what tactic to try , to make a breakthrough , how to shake those penned-up trojans clear of their walls and strew them down the plain ?
this was the bowl achilles offered up at games to commemorate his great friend — for the one racer who proved the fastest on his feet
why , i would be the first to counsel him to take your lead , zeus , wherever you command , my king of the black cloud !
but once you have ripped away prince hector 's life , back to the ships you go !
so mnestheus , so his dragon speeds ahead , cleaving the swells on the homestretch , so she flies along on her own forward drive
only deiphobus and the rugged warlord helenus have made it back alive , wounded with sturdy spears , both in the hand too , but zeus beat off their deaths
and you , you blessed sibyl who knows the future , grant my prayer
and now as the high gods bantered back and forth diomedes , loosing his war cry , charged aeneas — though what he saw was lord apollo himself , guarding , spreading his arms above the fighter , but even before the mighty god he would not flinch
with her spells she vows to release the hearts of those she likes , to inflict raw pain on others— to stop the rivers in midstream , reverse the stars in their courses , raise the souls of the dead at night and make earth shudder and rumble underfoot—you ’ ll see— and send the ash trees marching down the mountains
moving on through the crowds he found the cretans arming for combat now , ringing brave idomeneus
go now , patroclus dear to zeus , and question nestor
no shame for your wretched land , your gods of old ?
unexpectedly in they come , for savage allecto stalks the silent forests—some with torches charred to a point , some with heavy knotted clubs , whatever they find to hand their anger hones to weapons
turnus— even in flight he rebukes his men as he races , calling each by name , demanding his old familiar sword
father zeus , athena , apollo , if only i had ten men like nestor to plan with me among achaea 's armies — then we could topple priam 's citadel in a day , throttle it in our hands and gut troy to nothing
she alone , out of so many trojan mothers , dared to follow you all the way
message delivered , off she sped as the winds rose with a superhuman roar , stampeding clouds before them
think of the lion ranging the fields near carthage
and the trojans in turn , far across the field , pulling forces back from the last rough assault , freed their racing teams from under chariot yokes but before they thought of supper , grouped for council
do not hold me back
then i will fold her in cloud , poor girl , with all her gear and bear camilla ’ s unsullied body home to a tomb and lay her to rest in her own native land
now — before they topple towering ilium down , all our people slaughtered !
you and your archery !
all lie in shambles— look with your own eyes , feel with your own hands
gleaming in equal armor , equals now at peace , while darkness pins them down , but if they should reach the light of life , what war they ’ ll rouse between them !
how can you just sit back , feckless , and let them cart it off without a fight ?
whom would the labor of battle doom ?
the second , an amazon ’ s quiver bristling thracian arrows , slung from a sweeping sword-belt starred with gold and clasped with a brilliant jewel
but not for long would his comrades give him up : in a swift maneuver ajax wheeled them round , ajax , greatest in build , greatest in works of war of all the argives after peleus ' matchless son
on with it — give argive helen and all her treasures back to atreus ' sons to take away at last
now they are dumbstruck , driven mad by the sign they scream , some seize fire from the inner hearths , some plunder the altars—branches , brushwood , torches , they hurl them all at once and the god of fire unleashed goes raging over the benches , oarlocks , piney blazoned sterns
he swears that turnus alone is summoned , he alone called forth to battle
inspired now by the plans of his old friend , aeneas is torn by anguish all the more as dark night , looming up in her chariot , took command of the heavens , and all at once , down from the sky his father anchises ’ phantom seemed to glide and the words came rushing from him toward aeneas : my son , dearer to me than life while i was still alive !
but filled with anger , zeus who marshals the thunderheads let loose now : unbelievable !
so both men stood their ground , bracing man-to-man and a flock of comrades , hardened combat veterans followed the great ajax , ready to take his shield whenever sweat and labor sapped his knees
dogs and birds will have their fill — of trojan flesh , by heaven
quick , better to live or die , once and for all , than die by inches , slowly crushed to death — helpless against the hulls in the bloody press — by far inferior men !
even if all the rest of us drop and die around you , grappling for the ships , you would run no risk of death : you lack the heart to last it out in combat — coward !
but if we have troops and provisions still intact and the towns and men of italy still support our side , if the trojans have also paid a bloody price for glory— they have their burials too , the same storm ’ s struck us both— then why this shameful collapse before it all begins ?
these gloves of eryx , i ’ ll give them up for your sake , dares
apollo has granted this , your first flush of glory , he never envied your arrows , a match for the archer ’ s own
lash him with threats of the price that he will face
his father anchises answers : they are the spirits owed a second body by the fates
i will drive the west and south winds white with clouds and sweep in from the open seas a tearing gale to sear the trojan bodies and gear and spread your lethal flames !
the rutulians shrank in panic
i will never permit it
so he yelled and the famous spearman odysseus rushed in close and reared up to shield him
and last , sarpedon and valiant glaucus marched the lycians on from lycia far south , from the xanthus ' swirling rapids
but the lord of men agamemnon shot back , desert , by all means — if the spirit drives you home !
mezentius mounted up , his weight settling onto the horse ’ s back in the old familiar way , both hands holding the heft of well-honed spears , his helmet aflash with bronze and bristling horsehair crest , and into the surge of battle so he plunged , churning with mighty shame , with grief and madness all aswirl in that one fighting heart
he commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and summon the long-haired achaean troops to battle
now , for the moment , the bracing godsent night has stopped the swift achilles in his tracks
how i wish we had called a council then
a thousand terrific strokes he 's carried off — odysseus , taking the lead in tactics , mapping battle-plans
whoever defiles her sacred body with a wound— trojan , italian : make him pay me an equal price in blood !
call your men to arms with the dawn
never forget the latins are saturn ’ s people , fair and just , and not because we are bound by curbs or laws , but kept in check of our own accord : the way of our ancient god
now my army 's ruined , thanks to my own reckless pride , i would die of shame to face the men of troy and the trojan women trailing their long robes
if only you could burst the stern decrees of fate !
phoebus apollo lord of the silver bow had bred them both in perea , a brace of mares that raced the war-god 's panic through the lines
i was about to die
frenzy drives him , turnus ’ whole face is ablaze , showering sparks , his dazzling glances glinting fire— terrible , bellowing like some bull before the fight begins , trying to pour his fury into his horns , he rams a tree-trunk , charges the winds full force , stamping sprays of sand as he warms up for battle
here in front of your flaming pyre i will cut the throats of a dozen sons of troy in all their shining glory , venting my rage on them for your destruction !
to die once is enough ’ ?
they are the ones who brought this war upon me , devastating war against the achaeans — here , come closer , tell me the name of that tremendous fighter
why , any man will accept the blood-price paid for a brother murdered , a child done to death
pandarus and bitias— alcanor of ida ’ s offspring born by the nymph iaera once in jupiter ’ s grove—men like pines and peaks of their native land , who trusted so to their swords they fling wide the gate their captain entrusted to them , all on their own inviting enemy ranks to breach the walls
haul minerva ’ s effigy up to her house , we shout , offer up our prayers to the power of the goddess !
sit down in the ring , you two , and watch the horses — they will be home in a moment , racing hard to win
— both a better soldier and more loved by the gods
that day ranks of trojans , ranks of achaean fighters sprawled there side-by-side , facedown in the dust
despite my anguish i will beat it down , the fury mounting inside me , down by force
next he goes for sthenius , then anchemolus sprung from rhoeteus ’ age-old line , a man who dared befoul his own stepmother ’ s bed
the challenge still on his lips , a sudden shuddering seized him , eyes fixed in terror , the fury was looming up with so many serpents hissing , so monstrous her features now revealed
quick , take up your gear and off we go
but dauntless turnus never lost his faith in his daring , certain to seize the beaches first and hurl the invader off the land : now then , here is the answer to your prayers— we ’ ll break them all by force !
tityus too : you could see that son of earth , the mother of us all , his giant body splayed out over nine whole acres , a hideous vulture with hooked beak gorging down his immortal liver and innards ever ripe for torture
he feared his men might meet the worst at last , comrades who crossed a waste of seas for him to raise troy and mount their fierce assault
smeared on the old man 's head and neck the dung lay thick that he scraped up in his own hands , groveling in the filth
come , dismiss your ranks , have them make their meal
anger stirs up lies
again sarpedon missed — over patroclus ' left shoulder his spearhead streaked , it never touched his body
drawing his sharp sword achilles struck his collarbone just beside the neck and the two-edged blade drove home , plunging to the hilt — and down on the ground he sprawled , stretched facefirst and dark blood pouring out of him drenched the earth
he hacks their lolling necks and lops the head of their master , leaves the trunk of him spouting blood , the earth and bedding warmed with the wet black gore
no , dear as he is to you , and your heart grieves for him , leave sarpedon there to die in the brutal onslaught , beaten down at the hands of menoetius ' son patroclus
and there the man himself , turnus , his build magnificent , sword brandished , marches among his captains , topping all by a head
but once he looked the fast achaean drivers square in the eyes , shook the shield and loosed an enormous battle cry himself , apollo stunned the high courage in all their chests — they lost their grip , forgot their fighting-fury
sped by athena 's battle-plan — while staunch odysseus loosed the stamping horses , hitched them together tight with their own reins and drove them through the ruck , lashing them with his bow : he forgot to snatch the shining whip that lay in the well-wrought car
and now they would run in rings on their skilled feet , nimbly , quick as a crouching potter spins his wheel , palming it smoothly , giving it practice twirls to see it run , and now they would run in rows , in rows crisscrossing rows — rapturous dancing
what privilege are you begging for your ships ?
but as for achaea 's forces , all the ground that the broad trench enclosed from ships to wall was crammed with chariots , teams and men in armor packed into close quarters , yes , and the one man who packed them there , a match for rushing ares , hector the son of priam , now zeus gave hector glory
so they labored , the long-haired achaeans , while the gods aloft , seated at ease beside the lord of lightning , zeus , gazed down on the grand work of argives armed in bronze
that 's the place , i think — nowhere else are the long-haired argives so outfought
and so the souls are drilled in punishments , they must pay for their old offenses
he is the strongest argive now , i tell you
the ground was always steaming with fresh blood and nailed to his high and mighty doors , men ’ s faces dangled , sickening , rotting , and bled white
now the great array of gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long , overcome by gentle sleep
i thought for certain i would go to join the dead , descend to the house of death this very day — i thought i would breathed my last
some stalks fell in line with the reapers , row on row , and others the sheaf-binders girded round with ropes , three binders standing over the sheaves , behind them boys gathering up the cut swaths , filling their arms , supplying grain to the binders , endless bundles
and the men who lived in pherae fronting lake boebeis , in boebe and glaphyrae and iolcos ' sturdy ramparts : their eleven ships were led by admetus ' favored son , eumelus , born to admetus by alcestis , queen of women , the most radiant daughter pelias ever fathered
with that urging hermes went his way to the steep heights of olympus
clambering back into troy now , whipped weak with fear by the argive forces ?
safeguard our house , safeguard my grandson iulus !
king agamemnon answered crisply , tactics , my noble menelaus
have you forgotten — even now ?
and may that heartless dardan , far at sea , drink down deep the sight of our fires here and bear with him this omen of our death !
aeneas stopped in his tracks and huddled under his shield , crouching down on a knee but the spear in its onrush swiped the peak of his helmet off and swept away the plumes that crowned his crest
with that command he parted both contenders
now i will see if hector , for all his flashing helmet , leaps for joy when the two of us come blazing forth on the passageways of battle — or one of his trojans too will glut the dogs and birds with his fat and flesh , brought down in blood against the argive ships !
father zeus , when did you ever strike a mighty king with such mad blindness — then tear away his glory ?
nor did the man live long , not with the hate of all the gods against him
i too was glad to camp the night on the shipways , hopes soaring to seize their heavy rolling hulls
as the battle draws dead even across the plain the fury ’ s power has lived up to her promise
standing over him , so they would gloat and stab his body
then send him on his way with the wind-swift escorts , twin brothers sleep and death , who with all good speed will set him down in the broad green land of lycia
if only artemis had cut her down at the ships — with one quick shaft — that day i destroyed lyrnessus , chose her as my prize
no , jove sped iris down from the high heavens , winging strict commands for his sister , juno , if turnus did not quit the trojans ’ looming walls
he hands the glory to hector , today at least — tomorrow it 's ours , if he wants to give us glory
picked young soldiers stand in a ring around him
when the south wind showers mist on the mountaintops , no friend to shepherds , better than night to thieves — you can see no farther than you can fling a stone — so dust came clouding , swirling up from the feet of armies marching at top speed , trampling through the plain
and all-subduing sleep could not take him , not now , he turned and twisted , side to side , he longed for patroclus ' manhood , his gallant heart — what rough campaigns they would fought to an end together , what hardships they had suffered , cleaving their way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea
many suitors sought her all through latium , all ausonia too , and the handsomest of the lot was turnus , strong in his noble birth and breeding
he seized my foot , he hurled me off the tremendous threshold and all day long i dropped , i was dead weight and then , when the sun went down , down i plunged on lemnos , little breath left in me
so i loved him , at least : he never stinted with gifts to please my heart
what kind of men are these ?
loose those horses — or you go kill the men and leave the team to me !
but his son ascanius , now that he gains the name of iulus—ilus he was , while ilium ruled on high— will fill out with his own reign thirty sovereign years , a giant cycle of months revolving round and round , transferring his rule from its old lavinian home to raise up alba longa ’ s mighty ramparts
ah but how it galls me , it wounds me to the quick when the father tries to revile me with brute abuse , his equal in rank , our fated shares of the world the same !
let no lovely goddess — and no god either — try to fight against my strict decree
reaching the myrmidon shelters and their ships , they found him there , delighting his heart now , plucking strong and clear on the fine lyre — beautifully carved , its silver bridge set firm — he won from the spoils when he razed eetion 's city
awesome — as when the grip of madness seizes one who murders a man in his own fatherland and flees abroad to foreign shores , to a wealthy , noble host , and a sense of marvel runs through all who see him — so achilles marveled , beholding majestic priam
true , dawn on fiery dawn he drags him round his beloved comrade 's tomb , drags him ruthlessly but he can not mutilate his body
packs of dogs and the young herdsmen rushed to help but the lions ripping open the hide of the huge bull were gulping down the guts and the black pooling blood while the herdsmen yelled the fast pack on — no use
some heave on the flames the plunder stripped from the latin ranks they killed— their helmets , burnished swords , bridles , chariot wheels still glowing hot , while others burn the offerings well-known to the dead , their shields , their spears that had no luck
there is no more shattering blow that i could suffer
what are you panting after now ?
but argive units , spotting hector in full retreat , charged the trojans harder , their lust for battle rising
but once they reached the scaean gates and the great oak , there the two sides halted , waiting each other 's charge
quick to juno ’ s command , she lifts her wings , hissing with snakes , and quitting the airy heights of heaven , seeks her home in hell
but as hector backed away great ajax seized a rock — countless holding-stones for the fast trim ships were rolling round among the fighters ' feet — he hoisted one and heaved it at hector 's chest and struck him over the shield-rim , close to his throat and the blow sent hector whirling off like a whipping-top , reeling round and round
achilles grabbed a foot , slung him into the river , washed away downstream as he cried above him savage words to wing him on his way : there — lie there !
but all on his own he punts his craft with a pole and hoists sail as he ferries the dead souls in his rust-red skiff
then an awesome voice descended through the air , surrounding the trojan and rutulian ranks alike : no frantic rush to defend my ships , you trojans , no rising up in arms !
and now as then , my concern for him stands firm
and saw him drive achaeans against the ships that day he kept on killing , cutting them down with slashing bronze while we stood by and marveled — achilles reined us in : no fighting for us while he raged on at agamemnon
their hands pleading for peace while they arm their sterns with spears !
and no one knew
but quick little ajax rounded on him roughly : loose talk , idomeneus — why are you always sounding off ?
as they first fell from the boy ’ s lips , his father seized upon them , struck by the will of god , and made him hold his peace , and aeneas cries at once : hail to the country owed to me by fate !
you have done nothing to me
with the first light of day you will see for yourself as you convey him home
for the rest of troy , though , just a moment 's grief unless you too are battered down by achilles
good heralds of zeus and men , here , come closer
what is this madness blazing in your hearts ?
many , most of them violent ares cut the knees from under
a chariot-maker fells it with shining iron ax as timber to bend for handsome chariot wheels and there it lies , seasoning by the river
weave together some pretext for delay , while winter spends its rage and drenching orion whips the sea— the ships still battered , weather still too wild
but his mother , venus , stirred by fear—no wonder—by all the threats and the latins ’ violent uproar , goes to vulcan now and there in their golden bridal chamber whispers , breathing immortal love through every word : when greek kings were ravishing troy in war , her fated towers , her ramparts doomed to enemy fires , i asked no help for the victims then , i never begged for the weapons right within your skill and power
now , into your hands she entrusts her holy things , her household gods
but the argives surged to patroclus ' savage spirit — he spurred the aeantes first , both ablaze for battle : ajax , ajax !
trojans hold the high ground , over the beachhead there , camped against the ships — only a narrow strip to keep off sudden death
their spirits crowding around aeneas , left and right , beg him to linger longer—a glimpse is not enough— to walk beside him and learn the reasons why he ’ s come
you do not have long to live now , well i know : already i see them looming up beside you — death and the strong force of fate
but euaemon 's royal son laid low his son — eurypylus , chasing hypsenor fleeing on before him , flailed with a sword , slashed the trojan 's shoulder and lopped away the massive bulk of hypsenor 's arm
a reverent silence , all , and crown your brows with wreaths
that 's our battle-order , my iron-hearted trojans , just as i command
what do you care ?
in the next breath , bloated with gorgon venom , allecto launches out , first for latium , king latinus ’ lofty halls , and squats down at the quiet threshold of amata seething with all a woman ’ s anguish , fire and fury over the trojans just arrived and turnus ’ marriage lost
best to yield to night
that girl — the sons of achaea picked her as my prize , and i would sacked a walled city , won her with my spear but right from my grasp he tears her , mighty agamemnon , that son of atreus !
for you , i say , she lifts the thyrsus twined with ivy , dancing in your honor , letting her hair grow long , your sacred locks !
struggling with his wound , eurypylus answered , no hope , patroclus , prince
she ’ s human at first glance , down to the waist a girl with lovely breasts , but a monster of the deep below , her body a writhing horror , her belly spawns wolves flailing with dolphins ’ tails
so he called and the crowds fell back on either side , making way for the wagon
all dared an outrageous crime and what they dared , they did
book seventeen : menelaus ' finest hour
— it 's worthless as the wind !
your handsome face — a wonder
that goal in mind , i bleed my own people for gifts and food so i can build your courage , each and every man
insane as it is , i beg you , let me rage before i die !
and each commander marshals his own troops for battle , squadrons sheathed in bronze , and whets their fury with mixed accounts of the last night ’ s slaughter
and nisus speaks up first : euryalus , now for the daring sword-hand
antilochus never clear of enemies , always wheeling , bracing to face them , his own spear never resting , always brandished , quivering tense , his courage primed to cut men down with a hurl or charge them face-to-face
he just might impale you on his spear !
then , from that point on , harnessed in battle-armor , moving at forced march our army reached the alpheus ' holy ford at noon
no one could fight him , stop him , none but the gods as hector hurtled through the gates and his eyes flashed fire
but now you are back , hera — you ask me to do the impossible once again
when there , look , i dreamed i saw prince hector before my eyes , my comrade haggard with sorrow , streaming tears , just as he once was , when dragged behind the chariot , black with blood and grime , thongs piercing his swollen feet— what a harrowing sight !
the terrible gates of war with their welded iron bars will stand bolted shut , and locked inside , the frenzy of civil strife will crouch down on his savage weapons , hands pinioned behind his back with a hundred brazen shackles , monstrously roaring out from his bloody jaws
and i never dreamed the war would come to this : the trojans advancing all the way to our ships , men who up till now had panicked like deer , food in the woods for jackals , leopards , wolves — helpless , racing for dear life , all fight gone
all ranks scattered , leaving a no-man ’ s-land between them both
but here you come , charging out in front of all the rest with such bravado — daring to face the flying shadow of my spear
down he crashed , the torch dropped from his fist , right before hector 's eyes — he watched his cousin sprawl in the dust before the huge black ship and gave a stirring cry to all his units : trojans !
how savage the storm that broke from brute mycenae , scourging ida ’ s plains !
and the god of earthquakes only fueled his fire , taking the voice of thoas , son of andraemon , king over all pleuron , craggy calydon too and aetolian men he ruled revered him like a god : idomeneus , captain of cretans under arms — where have the threats all gone that sons of achaea leveled at these trojans ?
there is no way in the world a man can meet its edge and still survive the slashing — fear holds all men back
turnus kills the brothers fresh from apollo ’ s lycian fields and next menoetes who , in his youth , detested war but war would be his fate
and over it all , amid the hilltop lookout points there ’ s high ground , hidden , good safe shelter
if only he had obeyed achilles ' strict command he might have escaped his doom , the stark night of death
this is my pleasure , my decree
the brilliant achilles laid him low when he stormed cilicia 's city filled with people , thebe with her towering gates
there ’ s no faith left on earth !
here in a vast cave king aeolus rules the winds , brawling to break free , howling in full gale force as he chains them down in their dungeon , shackled fast
that greatest avenger , hercules !
no heroes either , bolting out of the argive pack for single combat !
but soon as a spear or bowshot wounds the king and atrides mounts his chariot once again , then i will hand hector the power to kill and kill till he cuts his way to the benched ships and the sun sinks and the blessed darkness sweeps across the earth
we press him hard—who is he ?
but grieving for all the rest , one breaks my heart the most and stabbing grief for him will take me down to death — my hector — would to god he had perished in my arms !
but once the ferryman , still out in the styx ’ s currents , spied them moving across the silent grove and turning toward the bank , he greets them first with a rough abrupt rebuke : stop , whoever you are at our river ’ s edge , in full armor too !
time and again i have gone to battle , fought with men but i have never seen an army great as this
that would be a disgrace
and you escaped that time , you fled to lyrnessus ' walls , but at one charge i sacked the place with athena 's help and father zeus , i tore the day of freedom away from all the women , dragged them off as slaves
some he would hand to the lords and kings — prizes of honor — and they , they hold them still
— i fathered hero sons in the wide realm of troy and now , now not a single one is left , i tell you
all the riders , following custom , wear their hair bound tight with close-cut wreaths , each bearing a pair of lances , cornel , tipped with steel
but it 's not the flowing feast that is on our minds now — no , a stark disaster , too much to bear , achilles bred by the gods , that is what we are staring in the face and we are afraid
indeed , i prefer her by far , the girl herself , i want her mine in my own house !
but her brother held power in tyre—pygmalion , a monster , the vilest man alive
men who hold fescennia ’ s ridge , aequi falisci too , the steep slopes of soracte and all flavina ’ s fields , the lake of ciminus rimmed with hills , and capena ’ s groves
so off she went to her room , the chamber her loving son hephaestus built her , hanging the doors from doorposts snug and tight , locked with a secret bolt no other god could draw
gazing out on the passageways of battle !
now throw helicon open , muses , launch your song !
they will give royal hector his fill of blows , strong on attack , glutton for battle as he is
his father stood at his side , lending sound advice to the boy 's own good sense : young as you are , antilochus , how the gods have loved you !
poor man , if only he ’ d marked his bride ’ s inspired ravings !
up now , set our minds on our own fighting-fury !
i also propose—to bear the news , confirm the pact— that a hundred envoys be dispatched , elite latin stock , their arms laden with boughs of peace and bearing gifts , hundred-weights of gold and ivory , throne and robe , our royal emblems
like him to the life , apollo provoked aeneas : aeneas — how could you and your men save troy with the gods against you ?
the games were over now
now as the moors adore you , feasting away on their gaudy couches , tipping wine in your honor— do you see this ?
laden with all their ranks came forty long black ships and phocian captains ranged them column by column , manning stations along the boeotians ' left flank
with that the son of magnanimous old nestor led the mare and turned her over to menelaus ' hands
you would never go with another to banquet on the town or feast in your own halls
meet me on level ground , in combat , hand-to-hand , gear up to fight on foot
oh , if only we had a shred of our old courage left !
yes , aeneas has quit his camp , his comrades and his fleet , he ’ s lighted out for the palatine hill , evander ’ s royal home
a twist of her wrist and the man hit the ground , springing aside as the goddess climbed aboard , blazing to fight beside the shining diomedes
merciless , iron man — confining your own men to the ships against their will !
that son-in-law from a foreign home , and he ’ s called to share my throne with equal power !
my sons laid low , my daughters dragged away and the treasure-chambers looted , helpless babies hurled to the earth in the red barbarity of war
so he mocked as athena and queen hera muttered between themselves , huddled together , plotting troy 's destruction
and telamon 's giant son agreed at once
mezentius ’ hissing sling— keeping its strap taut and dropping his spears , three times he whipped it around his head , let fly and the lead shot , sizzling hot in flight , split his enemy ’ s skull and splayed him out headfirst on a bank of sand
and the lines of fighters clash , matched in chiefs , in power , the rearguard packs tight , no room for maneuver , no spear hurled in the press
— he may respect my age , may pity an old man
if we can escape our death — if war and plague are joining forces now to crush the argives
i ca not make them out
and to steel her new resolve to leave the light , she sees , laying gifts on the altars steaming incense— shudder to hear it now—the holy water going black and the wine she pours congeals in bloody filth
why tremble so before the trumpet blares ?
and now his mother began to tear her hair
zeus and fate and the fury stalking through the night , they are the ones who drove that savage madness in my heart , that day in assembly when i seized achilles ' prize — on my own authority , true , but what could i do ?
no , not even now would the causes of her rage , her bitter sorrows drop from the goddess ’ mind
as a stallion full-fed at the manger , stalled too long , breaking free of his tether gallops down the plain , out for his favorite plunge in a river 's cool currents , thundering in his pride — his head flung back , his mane streaming over his shoulders , sure and sleek in his glory , knees racing him on to the fields and stallion-haunts he loves — so down from pergamus heights came paris , son of priam , glittering in his armor like the sun astride the skies , exultant , laughing aloud , his fast feet sped him on
lifting it from the chest he purified it with sulphur crystals first then rinsed it out with water running clear , washed his hands and filled it bright with wine
aphrodite daughter of zeus beat off the packs , day and night , anointing hector 's body with oil , ambrosial oil of roses , so achilles could not rip the prince 's skin as he dragged him back and forth
meriones , who had come in fourth took fourth prize , the two bars of gold
not with honor — you , the finest men in all our ranks
when they had put aside desire for food and drink , the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all
all day the rutulians encircle every entry , battling on to bring their enemies down in blood and ring their walls with fire
they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they had put aside desire for food and drink , ajax nodded to phoenix
how can he strike out at the enemy ?
where 's his war-gear lying ?
but soon as the white-armed goddess hera saw them mauling argive units caught in the bloody press , she winged her words at pallas : what disaster !
as arruns starts to circle swift camilla , a match for her spear yet more adept at cunning
then , spent as they were from all their toil , they set out food , the bounty of ceres , drenched in sea-salt , ceres ’ utensils too , her mills and troughs , and bend to parch with fire the grain they had salvaged , grind it fine on stones
uncontrollable hera — you and your treachery — halting hector 's assault and routing hector 's armies
hundreds of plunging war-teams dragging chariots down , snapping the yoke-poles , ditched their masters ' cars and patroclus charged them , heart afire for the kill , shouting his argives forward — slaughter trojans !
atrides hurled and missed , his spearshaft just slanting aside the man 's flank as iphidamas went for the waist beneath the breastplate — he stabbed home , leaning into the blow full weight , trusting his heavy hand but failed to pierce the glittering belt , failed flat-out — the point , smashing against the silver , bent back like lead
we will simply offer the argives tactics that may save them — so they wo not all fall beneath your blazing wrath
we will stay clear and escape the father 's rage
so , violating the peace , he tells his captains : march on king latinus—gear up for war !
strangers will come , and come to be your sons and their lifeblood will lift our name to the stars
they know him at once , his hated face , his immense frame , and aeneas ’ troops are stunned
turning to go , his helmet flashing , tall hector answered , do not ask me to sit beside you here , helen
the staff and the wreaths of god will never save you then
with that he seizes a heavy lance and wings it hard and straight through the bronze of maeon ’ s shield it pounds , ripping open his breast and breastplate both at once
turnus lowered his eyes and reached with his right hand and begged , a suppliant : i deserve it all
antilochus kneeling near , weeping uncontrollably , clutched achilles ' hands as he wept his proud heart out — for fear he would slash his throat with an iron blade
what ’ s more , i will pair you with pallas , my hope , my comfort
hector kept on ranging , battling ranks on ranks , slashing his spear and sword and flinging heavy rocks but he stayed clear of attacking ajax man-to-man
from here , his old tuscan home of corythus , he set sail , and now a golden palace high in the starry heavens welcomes him to a throne , and his altars add a name to the growing roster of the gods
he traded his gold armor for bronze with diomedes , the worth of a hundred oxen just for nine
no lame old age can cripple our high spirits , sap our vigor , no , we tamp our helmets down on our gray heads , and our great joy is always to haul fresh booty home and live off all we seize
whatever the stand-off round the sturdy walls of troy , with greek victory hanging fire until the tenth year came , was all thanks to aeneas ’ and hector ’ s strong right arms
aeneas of troy , famous for his devotion , feats of arms , goes down to the deepest shades of hell to see his father
up and at it , shipmates , man the thwarts !
— so i can declare to her my solemn , sound decree : achilles must receive a ransom from king priam , achilles must give hector 's body back
the rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship
so i gave way at last and lifting my father , headed toward the mountains
we ’ ll even be glad to raise your mighty walls ordained by fate , glad to shoulder up the foundation stones of troy !
now look what a wretched death i am doomed to suffer , trapped in this monstrous river like some boy , some pig-boy swept away , trying to ford a winter torrent in a storm !
gyas commands the huge chimaera , a hulk as huge as a city—trojans in three tiers drive her on , churning as one man at three ranked sweeps of oars
as the trojan charged head-on achilles speared him square in the brows — his whole skull split in half and down he crashed , achilles exulting over him : here you lie , otrynteus ' son — most terrible man alive !
now , as long as the armies fought to take the rampart , far from the fast ships , patroclus sat it out in his friend eurypylus ' shelter
another god might fear their wall — their idle whim — one far weaker than you in strength of hand and fury
trojan-born acestes relishes his new kingdom , holding court , giving laws to the elders called in session
the world was split three ways
three shafts of jagged hail they ’ d riveted on that weapon , three of bursting stormclouds , three of blood-red flame and the southwind winging fast
i will even honor him on a par with my orestes , full-grown by now , reared in the lap of luxury
the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs from zeus are about to crush the men of troy !
victors and victims killing , killed in turn : both sides locked , not a thought of flight , not here
even if you killed me , would priam drop his crown in your hands — for that ?
what , is a woman routing squadrons strong as ours ?
so straight to the king she went , blurting out her lies : ' i wish you would die , proetus , if you do not kill bellerophon !
there they stay , motionless , never slip from sequence
the old man 's taunts brought nine men to their feet
shrunken so , the demon flutters over and over again in turnus ’ face , screeching , drumming his shield with its whirring wings
young trojan recruits , keen to have a look , came scurrying up from all sides , crowding round , outdoing each other to make a mockery of the captive
apollo did not neglect the father 's orders
for long i ’ ve watched you trying to fight against it , all for nothing
over against them , trojans ripping the tiles and turrets from all their roofs—the end is near , they can see it now , at the brink of death , desperate for weapons , some defense , and these , these missiles they send reeling down on the greeks ’ heads—the gilded beams , the inlaid glory of all our ancient fathers
chariots too are rolled along , splashed to the rails with latin blood
if achilles fails to learn all this from our own immortal voices he will quail when a god attacks him face-to-face
then we can calm the god , and only then appease him
when one looks out for himself , alert but alone , his reach is shorter — his sly moves miss the mark
then over his shoulder agamemnon slung his sword , golden studs at the hilt , the blade burnished bright and the scabbard sheathed in silver swung on golden straps , and he grasped a well-wrought shield to encase his body , forged for rushing forays — beautiful , blazoned work
all obey me now
a cup for the hands of each guest — here beneath my roof are the men i love the most
now as they flex their bows to a curve with all their force , all each man can muster , drawing shafts from quivers , young hippocoön shot first , his bowstring twanged , his whizzing arrow ripped through the swift air and struck home , fixed deep in the timber mast
so why not go back now , hurl your challenge at menelaus dear to ares , fight it out together , man-to-man again ?
but what if they round on us ?
and here they display a cavern , an awesome breathing-vent for the savage god of death , and a vast swirling gorge spreads wide its lethal jaws where the acheron bursts through , and here the fury hid her hateful power , releasing earth and sky
but tomorrow at daybreak , armed to the hilt for battle , we man the towering ramparts
but paris flared in rage at his comrade 's death , his friend and guest among all the paphlagonians
he orders his own captains to carry tree-trunks clad in enemy arms , with the hated names engraved
what can i say first ?
my kinsman offered a gleaming sword-belt , rich red , bellerophon gave a cup , two-handled , solid gold — i left it at home when i set out for troy
an enormous oak , its branches lopped and trunk laid bare , he stakes on a mound and decks with the burnished arms he stripped from mezentius , that strong captain : a trophy to you , mars , the great god of war
noble nestor was first , achaea 's watch and ward , pleading , begging each man for his parents ' sake , be men , my friends !
head for the rocks , menoetes !
fighting words , and ares pounded his sturdy thighs with the flats of both hands and let loose in grief : now , you gods of olympus — who could blame me now if i descend on achaea 's ships to avenge my son , my butchered son ?
if you , a phoenician , fix your eyes on carthage , a libyan stronghold , tell me , why do you grudge the trojans their new homes on italian soil ?
so she urged and the swift runner complied at once : i must — when the two of you hand down commands , goddess , a man submits though his heart breaks with fury
so both men parted , ajax back to achaea 's armies , hector back to his thronging trojans — overjoyed to see him still alive , unharmed , striding back , free of the rage and hands of ajax still unconquered
what ’ s left for me now ?
what disgrace for us — to return without a fight to the bronze-floored house of zeus on mount olympus !
so how could i , claiming to be the highest goddess — both by birth and since i am called your consort and you in turn rule all the immortal gods — how could i hold back from these , these trojans , men i loathe , and fail to weave their ruin ?
and taking a rugged spearshaft tipped with whetted bronze the archer went on the run to stand by ajax ' side
dido , trying to raise her heavy eyes once more , failed— deep in her heart the wound kept rasping , hissing on
here pallas drives and lunges , lausus opposes him , all but equal in age , remarkably handsome , both , but fortune grudged them both safe passage home
but queen hera , her eyes wide , protested strongly : dread majesty , son of cronus — what are you saying ?
and first a strange radiance flashed in all eyes and a great cloud appearing out of the dawn came sweeping down the sky , trailed by the goddess ’ dancing troupes from ida
no , through the shocks of war , through walls of fire , they ’ ve found a way !
to witness the outrage agamemnon just committed ?
heartsick , he cloaks the boy with one as a final tribute , covering locks that soon will face the fire
is this the end he promised ?
whatever i might ask ?
rearing in their defense my war-team , hector 's horses were charging out to battle , galloping , full stretch
then on the twelfth some god cast him into achilles ' hands again and now he would send him off on a new journey , resisting all the way to the house of death
but devout aeneas makes his way to the stronghold that apollo rules , throned on high , and set apart is a vast cave , the awesome sybil ’ s secret haunt where the seer of delos breathes his mighty will , his soul inspiring her to lay the future bare
how on earth can a wounded man make war ?
like the wolf that ’ s killed some shepherd or hulking ox and before attacking spears can catch him , races off at once , darting into the pathless hills for cover— he knows he ’ s done some outrage—frantic now , he tucks his trembling tail between his legs and heads for the woods
but still not satisfied , he ’ s made his way to the farthest towns of corythus , arming a band of tuscans , countryfolk he ’ s mustered
we saw him drown at sea ourselves
but no comfort could reach the fighter 's heart till he went striding into the jaws of bloody war
still , just as you are , go out to the broad trench and show yourself to the trojans
nor will your mother lay your corpse on a bier and mourn her darling son — whirling scamander will roll you down the sea 's broad bosom !
your face , your features—hardly a mortal ’ s looks and the tone of your voice is hardly human either
and turnus wheels , dropping the task at hand and full of fury , speeds to the trojan gate to face the headstrong brothers
so in his house they raised the dirges for the dead , for hector still alive , his people were so convinced that never again would he come home from battle , never escape the argives ' rage and bloody hands
but , oh how wrong to rely on gods dead set against you !
fifty ships came freighted with these contingents , one hundred and twenty young boeotians manning each
still dead even , they plow their furrows , ripping the sea wide open with thrashing oars and cleaving triple beaks
and helen in all her radiance , her long robes , replied , why , that 's the giant ajax , bulwark of the achaeans
who were the kings ?
seeing the eagle sent their way from zeus , they roused their war-lust , flung themselves on the trojans with a vengeance
ah but now , since i have no desire to battle glorious hector , tomorrow at daybreak , once i have sacrificed to zeus and all the gods and loaded up my holds and launched out on the breakers — watch , my friend , if you will take the time and care to see me off , and you will see my squadrons sail at dawn , fanning out on the hellespont that swarms with fish , my crews manning the oarlocks , rowing out with a will , and if the famed god of the earthquake grants us safe passage , the third day out we raise the dark rich soil of phthia
but she heard the groans and wails of grief from the rampart now and her body shook , her shuttle dropped to the ground , she called out to her lovely waiting women , quickly — two of you follow me — i must see what 's happened
my sister , turnus replies , i recognized you long ago , yes , when you first broke up our treaty with your wiles and threw yourself into combat
but king agamemnon countered , not so quickly , brave as you are , godlike achilles — trying to cheat me
look , it ’ s your own ascanius !
this one forced himself on his daughter ’ s bed and sealed a forbidden marriage
then each can see for himself who comes in second , who takes off first prize
meriones killed phereclus — son of tecton , son of the blacksmith harmon — the fighter 's hands had the skill to craft all kinds of complex work since pallas athena loved him most , her protege who had built paris his steady , balanced ships , trim launchers of death , freighted with death for all of troy and now for the shipwright too : what could the man know of all the gods ' decrees ?
lichas next—cut live from his dead mother ’ s womb and hallowed to you , the healer— but what good now to elude the knife at birth ?
stripped of everything , now it ’ s past our power to reward you gift for gift , dido , theirs as well , whoever may survive of the dardan people still , strewn over the wide world now
but the boar stands fast , unflinching—where to charge ? — anywhere—grinding his tusks and shaking spears from his back
twice they plucked you safe from the ruins of troy
and next he caught erylaus closing , lunging in — he flung a rock and it struck between his eyes and the man 's whole skull split in his heavy helmet , down the trojan slammed on the ground , head-down and courage-shattering death engulfed his corpse
aeneas cries , so rushed !
you with your gentle temper , all your gentle words
the design is mine
just as he led his armies here for nothing , failure
the souls already crouched at the long thwarts— he brusquely thrusts them out , clearing the gangways , quickly taking massive aeneas aboard the little skiff
your name and armor mark the site , my friend , but i could not find you , could not bury your bones in native soil when i set out to sea
i hate that man like the very gates of death who says one thing but hides another in his heart
give our enemy glory or win it for ourselves !
down you go to troy 's and achaea 's armies now — and see that the trojans break the sworn truce first and trample on the argives in their triumph
now from its depths she seemed to catch his voice , the words of her dead husband calling out her name while night enclosed the earth in its dark shroud , and over and over a lonely owl perched on the rooftops drew out its low , throaty call to a long wailing dirge
again and again the brilliant swift achilles whirled , trying to stand and fight the river man-to-man and see if all the immortal gods who rule the vaulting skies were after him , putting him to rout — again and again the mighty crest of the river fed by the rains of zeus came battering down his shoulders , down from high above but achilles kept on leaping , higher , desperate now as the river kept on dragging down his knees , lunging under him , cutting the ground from under his legs
and achilles rose and challenged all the argives : we invite two men — our best — to compete for these
just add one gift to the hoards you tell us now to give and pledge the dardans
i will make you a sacrifice , a yearling heifer broad in the brow , unbroken , never yoked by men
muster the crews on shore , all tackle set to sail , but the cause for our new course , you keep it secret
and the old man rejoiced at that , bursting out , o my child , how good it is to give the immortals fit and proper gifts !
and just behind him , ancus , full of the old bravado , even now too swayed by the breeze of public favor
not once , i swear , did i pass some handsome shrine of yours , sailing my oar-swept ship on our fatal voyage here , but on each i burned the fat and thighs of oxen , longing to raze troy 's sturdy walls to the roots
but hector keeps his terrible fury blazing , keeps his bronze spear stabbing and never stops the slaughter — zeus hands him glory !
and vulcan forged them too , the mother wolf stretched out in the green grotto of mars , twin boys at her dugs , who hung there , frisky , suckling without a fear as she with her lithe neck bent back , stroking each in turn , licked her wolf pups into shape with a mother ’ s tongue
for all his fury , trust me , he will quake before he penetrates our front
do not harbor it deep inside you
disgraces — have you no shame ?
another zone where a torrent had hurled down boulders , heaving them far and wide and torn out trees from its banks
so let him die , outright — let a god wipe him out !
must not give you orders
my fame goes past the skies
turn your blades on me , rutulians !
at first light idaeus went to the beaked ships and out on the meeting grounds he found the argives , veterans close by the stern of agamemnon 's ship
alert as a hunting hound that lights on a trapped stag , hemmed in by a river ’ s bend or frightened back by the ropes with blood-red feathers—the hound barking , closing , fast as the quarry , panicked by traps and the steep riverbanks , runs off and back in a thousand ways but the umbrian hound , keen for the kill , hangs on the trail , his jaws agape— and now , now he ’ s got him , thinks he ’ s got him , yes and his jaws clap shut , stymied , champing the empty air
one sector , as he decrees , called troy , another , ilium
you throw to the winds the will of cronus ' son — time and again zeus gave you strict commands : stand by the trojan ranks and save their lives till the sun goes down at last and darkness shrouds the plowlands ripe with grain !
and after him came atrides , red-haired menelaus , next antilochus , urging his father 's horses : drive , the two of you — full stretch and fast !
father , bow your head in assent !
thanks to you , the african tribes , numidian warlords hate me , even my own tyrians rise against me
and striding out on shore they soared to the high sky and found farseeing zeus , and around him all the gods who live in bliss forever sat in a grand assembly
terrified of the trojans ’ hate , now troy was overpowered , terrified of the greeks ’ revenge , her deserted husband ’ s rage— that universal fury , a curse to troy and her native land and here she lurked , skulking , a thing of loathing cowering at the altar : helen
so much the better if i had
but if you hold back from the bloody foray here or turn some other soldier back from battle , winning him over — you with your soft appeals — at one quick stroke my spear will beat you down , you will breathe your last !
a joy it will be one day , perhaps , to remember even this
i give you this prize , a gift for giving 's sake , for now you will never fight with fists or wrestle , or enter the spear-throw , or race on sprinting feet
euryalus , nisus asks , do the gods light this fire in our hearts or does each man ’ s mad desire become his god ?
if only olympian zeus the lord of lightning grants us strength to repel this trojan charge then carve a passage through to troy 's high walls !
straddling his brother , acamas thrust and speared boeotian promachus , trying to drag the corpse by the feet , and acamas loosed his cry of exultation , argives — glorious braggarts , you , insatiate with your threats !
fortune may have made me a man of misery but , wicked as she is , she can ’ t make sinon a lying fraud as well
just as an instant sleep stole in and left him limp , the god , rearing over him , hurled him into the churning surf and down he went , headfirst , wrenching a piece of rudder off and the tiller too , and crying out to his shipmates time and again—no use— as the god himself goes winging off into thin air
they held tight as a working widow holds the scales , painstakingly grips the beam and lifts the weight and the wool together , balancing both sides even , struggling to win a grim subsistence for her children
no more war at a distance , waiting to take the long flights of spears and arrows — they stood there man-to-man and matched their fury , killing each other now with hatchets , battle-axes , big swords , two-edged spears , and many a blade , magnificent , heavy-hilted and thonged in black lay strewn on the ground — some dropped from hands , some fell as the fighters ' shoulder-straps were cut — and the earth ran black with blood
well , you will never plant your lance in my back as i flee you in fear — plunge it through my chest as i come charging in , if a god gives you the chance !
where are you headed now ?
here aeneas ’ frightened shadow throws itself into hiding , turnus hard on its heels , nothing can keep him back , bounding over the gangways , leaping the high decks
now then , launching out as the wind bears you toward sicilian shores and pelorus ’ crowded headlands open up a passage , steer for the lands to port , the seas to port , in a long southern sweep around the coast , but stay clear of the heavy surf to starboard
but if fighting 's flaring up in their own sector , at least let the rugged giant ajax come alone with teucer the master archer at his side
leading his troupe of eunuchs , his hair oozing oil , a phrygian bonnet tucked up under his chin , he revels in all that he has filched , while we keep bearing gifts to your temples—yes , yours—coddling your reputation , all your hollow show !
but all in the house is turmoil , misery , groans , the echoing chambers ring with cries of women , wails of mourning hit the golden stars
panthous ' son euphorbus , the best of his own age at spears and a horseman 's skill and speed of foot , and even in this , his first attack in chariots — just learning the arts of war — he would brought down twenty drivers off their cars
let bygones be bygones
but ours calls us on from one ordeal to the next
if you have the daring to stand against my heavy spear its point will rip your soft warm skin to shreds !
and the sibyl says no more but into the yawning cave she flings herself , possessed— he follows her boldly , matching stride for stride
they above all — we put those men in charge
but euryalus tears off rhamnes ’ battle-emblems and gold-studded belt : gifts that lavish caedicus once sent remulus of tibur , hoping to seal a pact with a friend then far away , and remulus , dying , passed them on to his grandson and , once he died , the latins commandeered them in battle , spoils of war
if only i ’ d been free to live my life , untested in marriage , free of guilt as some wild beast untouched by pangs like these !
hector amidst them now engaged them with a vengeance , doing bloody work with lances flung and a master 's horsemanship , destroying young battalions
why holding back , why now , why drag your heels ?
tame to the touch , it liked to frequent its master ’ s table
day after day i have gone against the trojans , never hanging back by the ships , i swear , old warrior that i am — but i have never seen such horses , never dreamed
but now he was bent on breaking men , probing the lines wherever he saw the largest mass and the finest gear but he could not smash through yet for all his fury
i am on my way to olympus heights , to the famous smith hephaestus — i pray he will give my son some fabulous armor full of the god 's great fire !
quick through the onset — better save him now !
ah , no wonder the men of troy and argives under arms have suffered years of agony all for her , for such a woman
while there they sit at their royal ease , exulting , the goddess of love and apollo lord of the silver bow : they loosed this manic ares — he has no sense of justice
then let us place his bones in a golden urn , sealed tight and dry with a double fold of fat , till i myself lie hid in the strong house of death
and seeing odysseus bleeding there the trojan troops exulted , calling across the melee , charging him in a mass as edging , backing off he gave ground now , calling his own companions
his heirs will blaze in courage , their might will sway the world
and rinsing off , their skin sleek with an olive oil rub , they sat down to their meal and dipping up their cups from an overflowing bowl , they poured them forth — honeyed , mellow wine to the great goddess athena
and at last he speaks out , filled with joy : may the gods speed the plans that we launch here , their own omens too !
and the great spearman idomeneus led his cretans , the men who held cnossos and gortyn ringed in walls , lyctos , miletus , lycastus ' bright chalk bluffs , phaestos and rhytion , cities a joy to live in — the men who peopled crete , a hundred cities strong
the fatherly captain smiled down at his friend and had them fetch a shield , didymaon ’ s work the greeks had torn from neptune ’ s sacred gate
but soon as achilles grew arm-weary from killing , twelve young trojans he rounded up from the river , took them all alive as the blood-price for patroclus ' death , menoetius ' son
with a hand uncallused still she flung her baby spears , swirled a sling-shot round her head with its supple strap and bagged a crane or snowy swan by the strymon ’ s banks
so they fought to the death around that benched beaked ship as patroclus reached achilles , his great commander , and wept warm tears like a dark spring running down some desolate rock face , its shaded currents flowing
your pleading repels me now — you must have something better than this to say
all of them—what disgrace—i deserted them all to die an unspeakable death
but then as i madly rushed from house to house , no end in sight , abruptly , right before my eyes i saw her stricken ghost , my own creusa ’ s shade
younger than nestor , the next generation up , flush with their fresh strength
he led an escort formed of the brave old soldier nestor 's sons , meges the son of phyleus , meriones and thoas , lycomedes the son of creon , melanippus too
but not even now would trojans and prince hector have burst apart the rampart 's gates and huge bar if zeus the master strategist had not driven his own son sarpedon straight at the argives , strong as a lion raiding crook-horned cattle
down through the vast encampment of achaea , the faster to rouse the slashing god of war !
but whatever death lays bare , all wounds are marks of glory
whether you ’ d like to attack from left or right or stand on the ridge and roll huge boulders down
as the wheeling sun swung round to the full light of day and put the dark to flight , first he commands his troops to follow orders , brace their hearts for battle , gear for war
folded deep in that bed they lay and round them wrapped a marvelous cloud of gold , and glistening showers of dew rained down around them both
the new thatch bristled thick on romulus ’ palace roof and here the silver goose went ruffling through the gold arcades , squawking its warning—gauls attack the gates !
wherever you are now — in lycia 's rich green country or here in troy , wherever on earth , you can hear a man in pain , you have that power , and pain comes on me now
but now , i see , he only plotted brutal treachery : now he commands me back to argos in disgrace , whole regiments of my men destroyed in battle
help either side as the fixed desire drives each god to act
but if my son was doomed to an early death , to know he died after killing volscian hordes and died as he led the trojans into latium : that will be my joy
you guided the arrow of paris , pierced achilles ’ body
whoever begs his mercy he will spare with all the kindness in his heart
i saw him myself , pyrrhus crazed with carnage and atreus ’ two sons just at the threshold— i saw hecuba with her hundred daughters and daughters-in-law , saw priam fouling with blood the altar fires he himself had blessed
down from the woods and high hills they lumber in alarm , the tribe of cyclops , down to the harbor , crowding the shore , the brotherhood of etna !
not all they claim was stored in the depths of troy , that city built on riches , in the old days of peace before the sons of achaea came — not all the gold held fast in the archer 's rocky vaults , in phoebus apollo 's house on pytho 's sheer cliffs !
you , old man , you would overpower us all !
the girl — i wo not give up the girl
soon as i tear the first stalk from its roots and rip it up from the earth
and so the powers assembled deep in zeus 's halls
i too have a noble birth to boast — my father , tydeus , mounded over now by the earth of thebes
you ’ ve threaded the rocks resounding with scylla ’ s howling rabid dogs , and taken the brunt of the cyclops ’ boulders , too
this strong right arm will put our truce to the proof
pray for a bird of omen , zeus 's wind-swift messenger , the dearest bird in the world to his prophetic heart , the strongest thing on wings — clear on the right so you can see that sign with your own eyes and trust your life to it as you venture down to achaea 's ships and the fast chariot-teams
i look back—what forces still stood by me ?
and back apollo strode , a god in the wars of men
the herald obeyed his captain 's orders quickly
never by will of mine did the god of earthquakes wreak havoc among the trojan ranks and hector and surge to help their foes !
take and return our trust
still the trojan exulted , wild with hopes of triumph as menelaus , drawing his sword with silver studs , leapt at pisander , who clutched beneath his shield his good bronze ax with its cleaving blade set on a long smooth olive haft — a clash !
i could scarcely interject a word , dismayed , i stuttered a few breathless phrases : alive , yes
tarchon himself has sent me envoys , bearing the crown and scepter , offering me the ensigns , urging : join our camp , take the etruscan throne
athena 's eyes are shining on you both !
anchises , silent a moment , drawing his son and sibyl with him into the midst of the vast murmuring throng , took his stand on a rise of ground where he could scan the long column marching toward him , soul by soul , and recognize their features as they neared
so staunch antilochus leapt at you , melanippus , stripping away your gear , but hector marked it now and straight through the ruck he charged antilochus hard
not that he quit the foray even then — he sprang at coon , gripping his big spear shaft tough from the gusting wind that whipped its tree
now it was king agamemnon 's turn to address them
bursting into tears the goddess slipped from under her clutch like a wild dove that flies from a hawk 's attack to a hollow rocky cleft for it 's not the quarry 's destiny to be caught — so she fled in tears , her archery left on the spot
by now some fighter better than he , a stronger hand has gone down in his own blood , or soon will go
and agamemnon the lord of men consented quickly : that 's no lie , old man — a full account you give of all my acts of madness
the next to die ?
now , making offerings to my mother , dione ’ s daughter , and to the gods who bless new ventures , i was poised , there on the beach , to slaughter a pure white bull to jove above all who rules the powers on high
for ten days the seer , silent , closed off in his tent , refused to say a word or betray a man to death
you ’ ll soon see the waves a chaos of ships , lethal torches flaring , the whole coast ablaze , if now a new dawn breaks and finds you still malingering on these shores
seizing a glinting whip , his fist on the handgrip , automedon leapt aboard behind the team and behind him achilles struck his stance , helmed for battle now , glittering in his armor like the sun astride the skies , his ringing , daunting voice commanding his father 's horses : roan beauty and charger , illustrious foals of lightfoot !
that gift will hold me here by the beaked ships as long as the life breath remains inside my chest and my springing knees will lift me
they next draw lots for starting places , captains stand on the sterns , their purple-and-gold regalia gleaming far afield
eunaeus , son of clytius , first
the night comes on at last
so i vowed at first
here 's some advice , not to be tossed aside , and i will tell it clearly
such fire athena blazed from tydides ' head and shoulders , drove him into the center where the masses struggled on
and zeus suspected nothing , not a word of treachery
you alone have pitied the long ordeals of troy—unspeakable— and here you would share your city and your home with us , this remnant left by the greeks
i will help you remember — you will give up your treacheries , you will see if your warm embraces serve you then , your bed of lust where you sank me in your arms
we can all banquet here to our heart 's content
now on with it , great pelides , let us fight !
and so poseidon shrank from defending allies out in the open — all in secret , always armed like a man the god kept urging armies on
why go over that unforgiving ground again ?
but the cretan captain idomeneus countered , spears ?
and now the prince , the captain of men aeneas would have died on the spot if zeus 's daughter had not marked him quickly , his mother aphrodite who bore him to king anchises tending cattle once
but patroclus , giving a cry to automedon whipping on his team , patroclus went for troy 's and lycia 's lines , blind in his fatal frenzy — luckless soldier
spurring his men while hector aflash in armor urged his trojans — thinking he would even go up against achilles : no fear of pelides now , my gallant trojans !
and the voice of sleep the soft and soothing drifted back
hold fast to my words and keep them well in mind to comfort your hard lot
and your fathers filled your ears with marching orders
but you , you wipe such thoughts from your mind
then , at last , at the end of their rope , his people revolt against that raving madman , they besiege mezentius and his palace , hack his henchmen down and fling fire on his roof
and at daybreak , marshal agamemnon , rouse your troops to fell and haul in timber , and furnish all that 's fitting , all the dead man needs for his journey down the western dark
so now i mourn your death — i will never stop — you were always kind
when he yokes his team , the sun shines down on us as well
so now the heart of aeneas leapt inside his chest when he saw the flocks of fighters crowding in his wake
so cast your fear to the winds
and then he revealed an unknown ancient treasure , an untold weight of silver and gold , a comrade to speed her on her way
with that , he rounded hard on lausus ’ comrades , slow to move , and lifted their captain ’ s body off the ground where lausus was defiling his braided hair with blood
why recall it all , the armada burned to ash on the shores of eryx ?
charging forward as always , head-on , until polydamas speared his shoulder — just grazing its ridge but grating bone — he thrust at point-blank range
and set apart , the virtuous souls , with cato giving laws
even latinus flees , cradling his defeated gods and shattered pact of peace
so , hecuba ’ s not the only one who spawned a firebrand , who brought to birth a wedding torch of a son
if it 's spears you want , you will find not one but twenty , all propped on my shelter 's shining inner wall : trojan weapons , stripped from the men i kill
just as you see achilles charge the front once more , hurling his bronze spear , smashing troy 's battalions — so each of you remember to battle down your man !
go now , take your meal — the sooner to bring on war
he grasped them both by the hands and hugged their shoulders , tears rivering down his cheeks : for you , good men , what reward can i find to equal the noble work you ’ re set on ?
and you , my father , carry our hearth-gods now , our fathers ’ sacred vessels
three squadrons with three captains weave their ways , each leading a column of twelve , six boys in double file , a trainer beside each troupe , all shining in the sun
lycian stalwarts could not force the achaeans back , breach their wall and burst through to the ships , nor could achaean spearmen hurl the lycians back , clear of the rampart , once they would made their stand
complex as the course the sons of troy now follow , weaving their way through mock escapes and clashes all in sport as swiftly as frisky dolphins skim the rolling surf , cleaving the libyan or carpathian seas in play
never again will i embrace him striding home through the doors of peleus ' house
patroclus — soon as the fighter cut their front battalions off he swerved back to pin them against the warships , never letting the trojans stream back up to troy as they struggled madly on — but there mid-field between the ships , the river and beetling wall patroclus kept on sweeping in , hacking them down , making them pay the price for argives slaughtered
afterward he must suffer what the fates spun out on the doomed fighter 's life line drawn that day his mother gave him birth
dares , dazed the most , shrinks back from the bout
for the fourth he set out two gold bars , for the fifth , untouched by fire as well , a good two-handled jar
and not only short , now , but filled with heartbreak too , more than all other men alive — doomed twice over
serestus gathers the armor , shoulders it home to you , king mars , your trophy now
there ’ s no fighting it , no making way against it , we ’ re too weak
to harass the trojans over land and sea , to ignite an unspeakable war , degrade a royal house and blend the wedding hymn with the dirge of grief : all that lay in your power
he ’ s on in years , but a god ’ s old age is hale and green
then at last , at the fourth dawn—landfall , rearing up into view , some mountains clear in the offing , a rising curl of smoke
no turning the tide till we wheel and face this man with team and car and fight it out with weapons hand-to-hand
but first , according to time-honored custom , i will test the men with a challenge , tell them all to crowd the oarlocks , cut and run in their ships
you , he argued , you in your prime , untouched by age , your blood still coursing strong , you hearts of oak , you are the ones to hurry your escape
what are their bodies made of , rock or iron to block your tearing bronze ?
but again some god swoops down and saves this hector — and has not he wiped enough of us out already ?
cries hit the heavens—now it ’ s the latins ’ time to turn tail and flee across the fields in a cloud of dust
you won me the scepter , jupiter ’ s favors too , and a couch to lounge on , set at the gods ’ feasts— you made me lord of the stormwind , king of cloudbursts
both of you , better yet , that 's best of all
so achilles , drawing the sharp sword at his hip , sprang at the man in rage as he tried to wrench pelides ' spear from the bank but his grip failed
outraged by my innocent friend ’ s demise until i burst out like a madman , swore if i ever returned in triumph to our native argos , ever got the chance i ’ d take revenge , and my oath provoked a storm of hatred
tracking a stray mule or a lost companion ?
achaeans breathing fury feared for machaon now : what if the tide turned and trojans killed the healer ?
the shouting of fighters soars , the clashing blare of trumpets
and once the god had made that great and massive shield he made achilles a breastplate brighter than gleaming fire , he made him a sturdy helmet to fit the fighter 's temples , beautiful , burnished work , and raised its golden crest and made him greaves of flexing , pliant tin
with those words on his lips , he gave his wife the embraces both desired , then sinking limp on her breast he courted peaceful sleep that stole throughout his body
all ranks held their peace
ajax , fiercest of all and atreus ’ two sons and the whole dolopian army , wild as a rampaging whirlwind , gusts clashing , the west- and the south- and eastwind riding high on the rushing horses of the dawn , and the woods howl and nereus , thrashing his savage trident , churns up the sea exploding in foam from its rocky depths
help me burn these accursed ships to ashes
he 's a proud man at the best of times , and now you have only plunged him deeper in his pride
we will fight again — i will finish you off next time if one of the gods will only urge me on as well
but we run counter to helenus ’ warnings not to steer between scylla and charybdis— only a razor-edge between the devil and deep blue sea— so it ’ s come about , we must swing back , when look , a northwind speeds to our rescue , sweeping south from the narrow cape of pelorus , driving us past the pantagias ’ mouth , that haven of native rock , past the bay of megara , thapsus lying low , sea-marks pointed out by achaemenides now , retracing the shores he once had coasted past as luckless ulysses ’ shipmate
he herded them off with his staff — they fled outside before the old man 's fury
how could he convoy priam clear of the ships , unseen by devoted guards who held the gates ?
aeneas himself , up in the lead beneath the ramparts , raises his arm and thunders out , upbraiding latinus , calling the gods : bear witness , i ’ ve been dragged into battle once again !
the pact ’ s already struck , its terms are set
she cries , poor husband , what impels you to strap that sword on now ?
the others listened closely and fell in line , moving out , and marshal agamemnon led them on
never once in his halls did he forget the gods who hold olympus , never , so now they remember him
i will tell it in brief
they singed the bristles , splaying the porkers out across hephaestus ' fire then poured the blood in cupfuls all around the corpse
and amidst the wall build gateways fitted strong to open a clear path for driving chariots through
the horses came behind as the old man cracked the lash and urged them fast throughout the city with all his kinsmen trailing
but once he caught her , stalking her through the onslaught , gallant tydeus ' offspring rushed her , lunging out , thrusting his sharp spear at her soft , limp wrist and the brazen point went slashing through her flesh , tearing straight through the fresh immortal robes the graces themselves had made her with their labor
but you , once he slashed away your life with his brazen spear he dragged you time and again around his comrade 's tomb , patroclus whom you killed — not that he brought patroclus back to life by that
so racked with grief for her brother he had killed she kept pounding fists on the earth that feeds us all , kept crying out to the god of death and grim persephone , flung herself on the ground , tears streaking her robes and she screamed out , 'kill meleager , kill my son !
or iarbas drags me off , his slave ?
how can you think of making all my labor worthless , all gone for nothing ?
perhaps you wonder how priam met his end
the father of men and gods complied at once
you glory over it too — making his wife a widow lost in the depths of their new bridal chamber , bringing his parents cursed tears and grief
it 's much against my will — his fury is overwhelming
they were the strongest mortals ever bred on earth , the strongest , and they fought against the strongest too , shaggy centaurs , wild brutes of the mountains — they hacked them down , terrible , deadly work
we must not loose our teams from the war-cars yet
approaching thetis , she caught her hand and spoke her name : thetis of flowing robes !
and actor 's son menoetius urging you , amy child , achilles is nobler than you with his immortal blood but you are older
the crowd was dazed—seven welted plies of enormous oxhide stitched in ridges of lead and iron to make them stiff
then , terrified by the sudden phantom , aeneas , wrenching himself from sleep , leaps up and rouses his crews and spurs them headlong on : quick !
oileus ' son alerted telamon 's son at once : ajax , since one of the gods who hold olympus , a god in a prophet 's shape , spurs us on to fight beside the ships — and i tell you he 's not calchas , seer of the gods who scans the flight of birds
i killed my last man there , i left him dead
and nestor the noble horseman spurred them more : what disgrace !
don ’ t fear the threats of war
vast tracts we have left a wasteland
they stood in a ring around the ox , took up barley and then , rising among them , king agamemnon raised his voice in prayer : zeus , zeus , god of greatness , god of glory , lord god of the dark clouds who lives in the bright sky , do not let the sun go down or the night descend on us !
the rest remain here too , all in strict formation , till the treasure trove is hauled forth from my tents and we can seal our binding oaths in blood
now , mother , go to the queen of plunder 's shrine and i will go hunt for paris , summon him to fight if the man will hear what i have to say
why did they raise up this giant , monstrous horse ?
i was killing his friends against the ships when the lord of the war cry ajax struck me down with a boulder square across my chest — he took the fight right out of me , i can tell you
athena luring him on with all her immortal cunning — and now , at last , as the two came closing for the kill it was tall hector , helmet flashing , who led off : no more running from you in fear , achilles !
but the lord of far-flung kingdoms , hero agamemnon , honored giant telamonian ajax first and last with the long savory cuts that line the backbone
