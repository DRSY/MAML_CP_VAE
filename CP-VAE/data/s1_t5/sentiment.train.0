but old age , our common enemy , has worn you down
then i bitterly attacked my crewmen ,
to carry ships and men on their way home
so , good sir , respect the gods
he turned them loose to feed inside the lovely yard , while he talked to odysseus ,
whom immortal gods hold dear
i would not rob him
with a dazzling thunderbolt i myself
why do you need this ?
she came up and began to wash her master
he may feel pity for us
that 's what troops muttered , both trojan and achaean
his heart was pitiless :
the kind of father you were born from
furthest out to sea
now a great work of war awaits you , the sort of enterprise you used to love
though i live in a palace far away
and take out his revenge in his own hall ,
a lethal fate to trojans
let a stranger slice this head off my neck
removed the virgin 's belt and made her sleep
take the whip and glistening reins
and people listened to him as if he were a god
for phoebus apollo had made them all fall back in an amazing panic
holds her head and eyebrows high above them all , so recognizing her is easy , though all of them
one of those arrogant young men
where on this wide earth do you intend to roam ,
but her intent is different
till then he would been treated always like a god
that 's what lycaon 's son cried out , boasting aloud
then she left for her mighty father 's well-built home
where one finds the cave of eilithyia ,
came down , and we slept there on the shore
the age of the socratic man is over ; put on wreaths of ivy , put the thyrsus into your hand , and do not be surprised when tigers and panther lie down , fawning , at your feet
arete then told her servants to set a large cauldron full of water on the fire as quickly as they could
he pays his tribute
did you not see
he called their finest men together , all the ones who commanded trojans troops , with all their rulers
but without myth every culture loses the healthy natural power of its creativity : only a horizon defined by myths completes and unifies a whole cultural movement
but come now , all of us should follow what i say
then warriors got up for the spear-throw competition—the son of atreus , wide-ruling agamemnon , and meriones , courageous attendant to lord idomeneus
or if he would send him off towards the city :
it 's not yet time to sleep here in the halls ,
as he fell , war-loving lycomedes pitied him
among some folk who spoke a foreign language ,
as many as you want—in my hut twenty one stand against the sunny wall , trojans spears i take from warriors i kill
that 's how sweet passion has seized hold of me , how much i want you now
argive helen sat there , too , with her attendant ladies , directing servants in their famous handicrafts
but her mind is full of other things
for we now understand what it means to wish to see tragedy and at the same time to long to get beyond all seeing : referring to the artistically employed dissonances , we should have to characterize the corresponding state by saying that we desire to hear and at the same time long to get beyond all hearing
circe , who will be the guide on such a journey ?
in all their pride they keep on plotting wretched things for me
danaans were driven back among their hollow ships in a rout , and the noisy tumult never stopped
then the trusty swineherd called out to his companions :
so come , let the steward begin to pour
do not let trojans kill achaeans off like this
that way he might come to recognizewhether or not we are of some use to him
in the stern part of the ship , the falling mast
yet even so , he could not revive him
but long-haired achaeans kept on shooting , attempting to hit hector with rocks and arrows
you should honour other men , your neighbours ,
and then we threw a cloak on top of him
it appears as the will , taking that world in schopenhauer 's sense , that is , as the opposite to the aesthetic , pure , contemplative , will-less state
so come now , tell me this ,
will die without a name in ithaca
with cruel intentions can invade the lands
then zeus planned the destruction of his men
flying on the right , when he departed
lord mulius , attending on amphinomus ,
achilles attacked , as well , heart full of savage anger , covering his chest with that richly decorated shield , his shining four-ridged helmet nodding on his head , the golden plumes hephaestus had set there shimmering around the crest
against godlike odysseus and did not relent until he reached his native land
beneath wide heaven—the city he wiped out
when i go to him , i can provide no help
and taken many splendid gifts away
it was so soft and shone out like the sun
from all these , great-hearted achilles took the fat , using it to cover up the corpse from head to foot , piling skinned carcasses around it
we will find them right before the gates , where i ordered them to meet the sentries
you are speaking to a man who thinks things through
that god was apollo , son of zeus and leto
standing by achilles , she clasped his hand , then said :
beyond ogygia—it 's called syrie ,
it 's a bad thing to chatter like the wind
out of this house , and they would be miserable
your bones will lie rotting here in trojan soil , recalling the work we failed to finish
though only for the briefest moment ,
wise meriones then replied :
up now , divinely born patroclus , master horseman
hector , i suppose you thought you could safely strippatroclus , without giving me a thought , since i was far away
if , however , in the exemplification here indicated , we have rightly associated the disappearance of the dionysian spirit with a most striking , but hitherto unexplained , transformation and degeneration of the hellenic man -- what hopes must revive in us when the most certain auspices guarantee the reverse process , the gradual awakening of the dionysian spirit in our modern world !
three times godlike achilles yelled across that ditch
but what i can do with my hands and feet and my own power , i will do
if you are with me now as eagerly
i washed my hands in a protected spot ,
with this sword odysseus struck leiodes right on the neck—
as we roamed across the misty waters ,
in fact , they seem to have felt this way
with these words , swift-footed iris went away
i set off for aeolus ' splendid palace ,
they asked him all kinds of questions
from his eyes then
athena took good care to veil him in thick mist , so no bold phaeacian who ran into him
hephaestus , though slow , has now caught ares ,
who gave him hospitality and kindness
well now , there 's an agile man !
then he kissed his dear son and held him in his arms
the world symbolism of music for this very reason can not in any way be overcome by or reduced to language , because music addresses itself symbolically to the primordial contradiction and pain in the heart of the original oneness , and thus presents in symbolic form a sphere which is above all appearances and prior to them
his hair—it flowed up like a flowering hyacinth
once my sharp bronze killed him , i ran off to a ship without delay ,
disastrous advice to my companions :
cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids
so i am telling you to do as follows—
when lord odysseus , who had endured so much , saw him worn down with age and carrying so much heavy sorrow in his heart ,
had fallen over it , and so with that
that 's the only thing that spared the argivesand saved their ships beached on the shore
comrades who followed him , i gathered up
menelaus , son of atreus and cherished of zeus ,
i know how to charge into the frenzyof fast chariots , and i know how to danceto ares ' tune in the grim killing zone
wherever we encounter the naïve in art , we have to recognize the highest effect of apollonian culture , something which always must come into existence to overthrow the kingdom of the titans , to kill monsters , and through powerfully deluding images and joyful illusions to emerge victorious over the horrific depths of what we observe in the world and the most sensitive capacity for suffering
in that case , you are an old friend of my father
eurymachus , i am not requesting you to furnish me with guides
beside nestor stood young men holding five-pronged forks
i might even assert that in goethe 's proposed nausikaa it would have been impossible to make the suicide of that idyllic being ( which was to be carried out in the fifth act ) grippingly tragic , for the power of the apollonian epic is so extraordinary that it magically transforms the most horrific things through that joy in and redemption through appearances right before our very eyes
his spirit urged him to glut ares , warrior god with the bull 's hide shield , on hector 's blood , more so than on the blood of any other man
then peisander made straight for glorious menelaus
alive or dead , he told me he would heard nothing
it is a shroud for warrior laertes , for the day a lethal fate will strike him
let there be one in charge , one ruler , who receives from crooked-minded cronossceptre and laws , so he may rule his people
as he spoke , our hearts collapsed , terrified
swift-footed achilles then said in reply :
hector was convinced by his advice
it almost reached his chin
all poetic art and poeticizing
he heard the crashing of the sea against the rocks—
others , however , have not been deterred from this blasphemous assertion
the bronze went straight on through , severed his belt , then drove low in his stomach
with these words , he drove themon
smoke rising in the middle of the island , through dense brush and trees
all these things have thus come to an end
lord odysseus , who had endured so much , held him
then you can offer me a gift , as your guest
in all phaeacia , from whom you yourself
once our swords have sliced your strength from you , we will mix your property , all the things you have inside your home
the premise of the opera is a false belief concerning the artistic process : the idyllic belief that every sentient man is an artist
woman , tell me the truth
but i will describe for you
his spear hit hypsenor , son of hippasus , his people 's shepherd , low down in the liver
friends , this marker herebelongs to me
from inside the hut patroclus heard him
then he left his room , his face resembling a god 's
with these words , the goddess set the armour down before achilles
but at that hour when the morning star appears , announcing that light is coming to the earth , the star after which dawn in her yellow robe moves out across the sea , by then the fire was dying
each man 's heart sank to his feet
good nurse , they are all enemies hatching evil plans ,
here and there along his vineyard slopes
athena spoke and thus swayed his foolish wits
my loyal companions feasted for six days—
even if he 's living in a wealthy home ,
she said i alone should listen to them
poetry , in other words , was subservient
an irrepressible laughter then pealed out
in zeus ' heart the best idea seemed to beto send out a wicked dream to agamemnon
i swear to you , agelaus , by zeus
then a vagrant from the community arrived ,
men or women in his household , knew
he was easily the best , your father ,
or welcome strangers and fear god in their hearts
that 's what hector thought as he stood there waiting
not in the usual way , but at sunset
but when he hears you are still alive , his heart feels joy , for every day he hopeshe will see his dear son come back home from troy
and thus avoid destruction
old chryses burned them on split wood , poured wine on them
as his mind and heart were thinking about this ,
that have overcome him
and nothing would have separated us
has buried them , although they live on still
as he moved , going after peleus ' son among those crowds of men , he did not go unnoticed
black night concealed the heavens , and no one noticed us or was aware
and fair-haired menelaus , the last one
throughout the army , in the ranks , they ate their dinner
but leave me there , in case old man nestor
telemachus then called out to his companions
that 's what the suitors said
her mother loaded on a box full of all sorts of tasty food
he then told competitors to shoot the dove
someone who herded sheep , but with a refined air that marks the sons of kings
come then , let 's do what black night demands—prepare a meal
odysseus , when we look at you , we do not perceive
to leave this house , for he 's very worried
when hector saw agamemnon going back , he gave a loud shout to the lycians and trojans :
crafty odysseus smiled at him and said :
those dear companions scylla snatched away
though you are keen to go , let my servants fetchthose presents from my ship and bring them here , so you can see if you approve of them
just as the sun began to shine down on the fields , rising from the gently flowing ocean depths , climbing in the sky , the two groups met each other
but when he re-launched
great hector of the shining helmet then replied :
as he fell , his head , mouth , and nose hit the earth well before his knees , and ajax cried to brave polydamas :
with her immortal sea nymphs to look on
i wo not let anyone who 's touched my food
in the centre lay two golden talents , to be awarded to the one among them all who delivered the most righteous verdict
while they were slaughtering the sailors there ,
that 's how the gods then talked to one another
it sailed beyond the marks of all the other men , speeding lightly from his hand , and athena ,
for i am ashamed to stand stark naked
then peneleus and lycon charged each other
stay there and sit with him
or if you fight him , i will control the horses
but he says he will not return that noble lady , wife of menelaus , though the trojans wishhe ’ d do that
a nurse went , too , carrying the child
they bring fresh water
tell him he can move among the suitors
so as their tempers heated up , they both grew angry on the polished threshold by the lofty doors
with a sharp bronze point
you will get the credit for what they begin
if only that had happenedto some other man and left you in place , among the ranks of younger warriors
zeus ' daughter aphrodite answered her :
only to be butchered by my own hearth ,
you claimyour family stems from a broad flowing stream , but i boast a family coming from great zeus
you will learn about these thingswhen all the immortals do—the evil planszeus is proposing , something , in my view , which wo not please all hearts alike , in gods or men , although some may still enjoy our feast
meanwhile at dawn odysseus and the loyal swineherd , once they would sent the herdsmen out with droves of pigs , made a fire in the hut and prepared their breakfast
what country is this ?
if he would done what the son of peleus had told him , he would have missed his evil fate , his own dark death
glorious hector then said to ajax in reply :
to any city , any land
the two of them went inside the inner chamber of the hollow cave and lay down beside each other to make love
gathering all sorts of goods , another man
here , you can soon add up
a nasty night came on
father zeus , if , in wheat-yielding argos , any man has ever burned fat thighs of bulls or sheep in sacrifice to you , praying for his return , and you answered him , nodding your head and promising assent , olympian god , remember that
the shade of my companion speaking out
on your broad shoulders , then fix that fine oar in the ground there , and make rich sacrifice to lord poseidon with a ram , a bull ,
the huge rock door , drove his rich flock outside ,
strong diomedes , with a scowl , answered sthenelus :
is stirring up a nasty fight against us ,
just as some god sends a breeze to sailors in distress , when they work themselves too hard rowing out at sea , bodies broken with fatigue at their polished oars—that 's how these two looked to the long-suffering trojans
to drink , the water there was swallowed up
half the white milk and set aside the whey
wise penelope then said to him :
i think the brains and blood of many suitors
she rushed down from olympus ' peak
ares urged the trojans on , while bright-eyed athena kept rousing the achaeans
so with a heavy heart
but since he 's picked up his thieving habits ,
it had a silver cross-piece
and struck the mules
or in the sea , being tossed around by waves
prepare to win the contests
as she left this house , would call upon
the two hatched a plan against the suitors ,
we will ship you off at once
inside the city , when tribes of men get old ,
as he comes home
i will make that sacrifice to you , and more— on that beast i will plate both horns with gold
those complaints of yours are not unjustified
to make me miserable
but she replied and said :
he jabbed his spear into the life-giving earth , and then spoke to that shepherd of his people as a friend :
a dreadful panic on my comrades
thanks to favours from the gods , you have
the bronze sliced through his hand into the bow
to visit many lands collecting wealth
boat oars , and well-trimmed ships , in which with joy they cross the gray salt sea
or did it turn itself around ?
not while i am alive , gazing on the earth
he kept looking round , like a bearded lion which dogs and men chase off— with spears and shouts they drive it from the farm
she made her taller , too , and changed her figure , so it looked more regal
who was sitting there beside her
but when they reached the middle of the crowded meeting , with quick beats of their wings they wheeled around ,
and he 's not worth a damn
they brought off the offerings to archer god apollo
i stayed there seven years , the entire time ,
the island is not poor
but now one of you
in a corner , terrified
all his skin was swollen , and sea water flowed in streams up in his mouth and nose
with this insight a culture is inaugurated that i venture to call a tragic culture
achilles ' noble heart moaned aloud
we were no longer disconcerted at witnessing his style
and then grant all other men of pylos
ajax , one of the godsdwelling on olympus , in a prophet 's shape , tells us both to fight on by the ships
melanthius finished , and as he moved on past them , in his stupidity he kicked odysseus on the hip
my dark heart thinking , as i walked , of many things
who has fixed our swift ship out at sea as she was racing homeward ,
hector , you asked me to tell you the truth
to the swineherd and the keeper of the goats
that infallible old man of the sea
like the gods who occupy wide heaven
that i should at all costs miss this island ,
wine restores strength well in a weary man , and you have grown tired guarding your own family
she does not lack
and give some news to wise penelope
their hearts dismayed , and they departed from the hall , past the large courtyard wall
this opposition became more dubious and even impossible as similar impulses gradually broke out from the deepest roots of hellenic culture itself
hermes the deliverer conducted them along the murky passageway
i do not think he went hometo cheer up his dear wife and worthy parentson his own two feet
total disaster , if we chance to meet
afraid i might reprimand him harshly
but if i sow a lethal fate for them ,
your mother wo not set you on your funeral bed , lamenting over you
you men who are more powerful than me ,
phaeacian power and strength depend on him
telemachus , may zeus , hera 's loud-thundering husband ,
were four , the sons of dolius six , and with them dolius and laertes , though they had gray hair ,
do not hide it
slitting the throats of two of them , achilles tossed them on the pyre
penelope paused , then spoke to eurynome ,
if not , then i will take a prize myself by force , something from you or ajax or odysseus
in bowls for him to drink up with his dinner
where people of the town collect their water ,
melanthius poured their wine
he would had the bad luck to meet godlike achilles
after its trip across the misty seas ,
let us mark this well : the alexandrian culture , to be able to exist permanently , requires a slave class , but with its optimistic view of life it denies the necessity of such a class , and consequently , when its beautifully seductive and tranquilizing utterances about the dignity of man and the dignity of labor are no longer effective , it gradually drifts toward a dreadful destruction
whoever strikes at you will have to fight
his belly tells him to move in against the flocks ,
but now the gods with their malicious plans
after his meal , he easily rolled back
and many other men lay dead around them
said these words and left
hurry and carry him outside the house ,
who came with me on my trip from pylos
in his beaked ships
here , in silence , we brought our ship to land ,
i won her with my spear , once i would destroyedher strong-walled city
with hospitality , and questions him
listen to me , those of you who are courting
to be king is not something evil
calypso , the lovely goddess , had told him to keep this star on his left as he moved across the sea
hostile troops are camped close by
the army streamed out , foot soldiers and charioteers , making a huge din
so tell me this—
picked up in her firm grip a curved key made of bronze—
it 's disgraceful how such wretched cowards want to lie
how can the ugly and the disharmonic , the content of the tragic myth , stimulate aesthetic pleasure ?
that ’ s what i said
the godlike minstrel demodocus , the man
should by rights attend
from the other , cold water comes , as cold as hail or freezing snow or melting ice , even in summer
you are sleeping , son of fiery atreus , tamer of horses
peiraeus , we do not know how these matters will turn out
some hurried to bring in the dead , others to find wood
they set it alight
then , sick at heart ,
then telemachus climbed up
with a heavy heart ,
and then tell him
with these words , lord achilles conducted them inside his hut and seated them on chairs covered with purple rugs
achaeans troops missed his presence there among them
they raced on board , went to their places ,
but we would be ashamed by public gossip
my cunning name had pulled off such a trick
and set it in a finely-polished rack , which held many other spears belonging to odysseus
with an uncommon wisdom
now they are ashamed of you
with these words , athena seduced him forward
that 's how the soldiers talked together
then lycaon 's knees gave way , his heart collapsed
i will give him some of it and send him off
and roams mountain slopes and grassy valleys seeking pasture , and then the lion comes
come now , when the long-haired achaeans leave , sailing their ships to their dear native land , you can smash their wall , take it out to sea , bury the great shore under sand , and so erasethat great achaean wall completely
in these three basic forms of optimism lies the death of tragedy
for my good news—let me have fine clothing ,
one 's family gets rich immediately ,
while you lead us to circe 's sacred home
i will get the glory
skilled in making lovely things
then wise penelope replied :
apollo would not let panthous ' son be killed among those fighting in the front
whenever they intended to retire to bed
old man , in our assembly once againyou win out over all achaea 's sons
but now , since the time you left for pylos ,
and divinely born odysseus , sacker of cities ,
i will not speak of , nor could i recite ,
servants carrying bread , plenty of meat ,
while in the theatre daytime might be only artistic and stage architecture only symbolic , and the nature of the metrical language might have an ideal quality , nevertheless , on the whole , a misconception still ruled : it was not enough , schiller claimed , that people merely tolerated as poetic freedom what was the essence of all poetry
people will forgetthat wall which phoebus apollo and myselfworked hard to build for heroic laomedon
and that 's the reason
daughter of a wealthy man , and compete
aeneas then leapt down with his long spear and shield , fearing achaeans would somehow haul away the corpse
her dear nurse eurycleia
even if he slanders you and calls you coward , he will not convince the trojans or dardanians , or trojan wives , married partners of brave menyou have thrown into the dirt , still in their prime
but with the food
achilles told patroclus , his companion , to sacrifice to all the gods
while the disaster gradually slumbering in the womb of theoretical culture gradually begins to frighten modern man , and he anxiously ransacks the stores of his experience for means to avert the danger , though he has no great faith in these means ; while he , therefore , begins to divine the consequences of his situation -- great men , universally gifted , have contrived , with an incredible amount of thought , to make use of the paraphernalia of science itself , to point out the limits and the relativity of knowledge generally , and thus to deny decisively the claim of science to universal validity and universal aims
the shimmering river waters were held back
give me the polished bow , so here among you
achaeans quickly led their fast horses back from bouprasium to pylos , all of thempaying tribute among all the gods to zeus , and among all men to nestor
cold water flowed down from a rock above , and on the top of that
he followed in her footsteps
together with the spirit in my crew ,
is pessimism necessarily the sign of collapse , destruction , and disaster , of the exhausted and enfeebled instinct , as it was among the indians , as it is now , to all appearances , among us modern peoples and europeans ?
against poseidon , my father 's brother ,
a lengthy voyage , to do away with me
you are keen for me to marry—you must wait
saying this , hector swung his whip down from his shoulders , lashing on his horses , calling trojans in the ranks
shortly i shall also indicate by name the forces which seem to me to guarantee a new birth of tragedy and who knows what other blessed hopes for the german character !
of making love , then entertained each other telling stories , in mutual conversation
brings the same delight a brother does
now asius is avenged !
has always been that way and forces you
just as any man
the power of watery winds could not get through , none of helios ' rays could pierce it , and the rain would never penetrate
where fair-haired circe lived , fearful goddess
and met their fate alongside agamemnon
all bewitched by circe 's wicked potions
the entire plain dried up
when rose-fingered dawn came up , they gathered around that pyre of glorious hector
you do not consider this , do not think at all
achaea 's sons apportioned it all fairlyamongst themselves
once he would eaten his heart 's fill and had enough , eumaeus filled the bowl from which he drank himself and gave it to him full of wine
it 's flooding through me , overpowering the hearthere in my chest—not even when i lusted for
ajax 's spear struck him first on the peak of his horse-plumed helmet
resourceful odysseus went into his hut , then slung across his shoulder his finely decorated shield and set off with them , to find noble diomedes , son of tydeus
great spear-fighting myrmidons reached home safely , led by the glorious son of brave achilles ,
the achaean elders gathered round achilles , urging him to eat
then he questioned him :
to fight against the trojans
never gets back home
the old man came up out of the water ,
aeneas then shouted out , addressing hector :
then said to eumaeus :
their hearts had not responded to what he would just said
in her right hand she held out in a golden cup some honey wine , so the men could pour libations before setting out
but now he 's died by some pitiful fate
in word or deed
these swift abantes came with elephenor , their hair grown long behind , warrior spearmen , filled with fierce desire to tear apart their enemies , to pierce armed bodies with their long ash spears
my queen , for he tells the kind of stories
old man , from the way you tend this orchard
i came home , and the immortals gave me
come now , let 's give back argive helen
without being noticed and remind them all
misery like this , all this suffering , is not for us alone
so eurymachus struck a person serving wine
on sea-girt dia killed ariadne ,
then he took a wife , built a high-roofed house , and fathered two strong sons , antiphates and mantius
telemachus ' exact age is not known , but he must be in his mid to late teens , since he was a young child when odysseus left for troy about thirteen years previously
flowing oceanus : oceanus or ocean is a river which in homeric geography surrounds the lands and the sea—it is , as it were , the outer rim of the world ( which is flat )
their masters ' chariots , fully covered , remained stationed in the huts
immortal gods who dwell on mount olympus no longer disagree about all this
the many rival contests where phaeacians
then we will come up to the city
the best thing i could do
earthshaker poseidon then answered him and said :
autolycus , you must personally find
against huge rocks in a perilous place
that how odysseus was coming out to meet those fair-haired girls ,
without tears , their hearts so deeply moved
for it 's grand to listen to a singer
to follow on your route—for you yourself
from that place i drifted for nine days
to those other men to go home at once
but if the gods decline , i say we stop
so keep on after them
even a human man , though mortal and ignorant of what i know , can achieve what he intends for someone else
you were always gentle
to whom she 's well disposed she can resolve
here , take a remedial potion with you ,
just as you honoured me , striking hard against achaeans then , so now , grant me what i pray for—remove disaster , this wretched evil , from the danaans
in the whole flock by far
to the farmyard of a man who understands
with long pointed leaves stands at the harbour head , and close beside it there 's a pleasant shadowy cave , sacred to the nymphs whom people call the naiads
so come , let 's all agree to what i say
an old sicilian woman
let 's end this competition
his leg fell in the basin , and the bronze rang out
eurycleia , once she saw the bodies and huge amounts of blood , was ready to cry out for joy now that she would seen such a mighty act
achilles , you may be the most powerful of men , but you are inflicting too much damage here
among the trojans that he was odysseus
where are you from ?
people closely connected to the gods
they do not let me join them past the river
that you are a strong , fine-looking man ,
immediately sent my men bad omens—
but hector has the power of deadly fire
waiting for your word
i once entertained a man , someone who would come
they would given up all hope for hector 's safety
the real joy for the greek in this dialectical solution is so great that a sense of powerful serenity invests the entire work , which breaks the sting of the dreadful pre-conditions which started the process
once she would finished , i answered her :
stay calm , mother , even though you are upset
know if i have seen him or heard any news
he bears those , too , though much against his will
i can make sincere suggestions to him
but your heart and wicked acts
two swift dogs went with him
with this canon at hand , euripides measured all the individual features and justified them according to this principle : the language , characters , dramatic construction , the choral music
they have become their god 's timeless servants , living beyond all regions of society
but then , south wind kept blowing one whole month
and here , on the edges of this island ,
and take the one he wishes for himself
the lovely lady talked of all she would been through in the house , looking at that destructive group , the suitors , who , because of her , had butchered
since there 's no future thanks for one 's good deeds
for both of us
many fine possessions stored away at home
to hurt him , in their eagerness to kill him
he would have killed the man
the housekeeper , quickly and in secret
to tell her dear father and her mother
they ran away in all directions
how i wish that he , too , might be struck
then he spoke to him—his words had wings :
but what about your battle with those trojansyou put to flight ?
falling thick and fast
but all the suitors cried out in the hall
you will enrage those gods and make them bitter
once he would said this , he put his lovely armour on , around his shoulders , and roused telemachus ,
taking the shining whip which fit his grip , automedon jumped in the chariot
this is the phenomenon of the lyric poet : as an apollonian genius he interprets the music through the image of the will , while he himself , fully released from the greed of his will , is a pure , untroubled eye of the sun
his dear nurse , eurycleia , then said to him :
across the island , far from my comrades ,
away from his companions , grasped his hand , and spoke :
where nymph calypso lives
on that floor , young men and women whose bride price would require many cattle were dancing , holding onto one another by the wrists
friends , now i will give the word—let 's hurl our spears
you two ajaxes , leaders of the argives armed in bronze , for you i have no orders
in different ways to see if , while its lord was gone ,
antilochus feared he might hurt himself or slit his throat with his own sword
you have that right
i may not be the best in battle
when resourceful lord odysseus noticed that ,
you should go inside the well-built home
for which my heart had gone through so much pain , suffering men 's wars and dangers on the sea ,
but nonetheless let her go back with the ships
achilles slept in a corner of his well-built hut , with lovely briseis stretched out there beside him
from such innerly degenerate music those with a true musical nature turned away with the same aversion which they had displayed before the art-killing tendency of socrates
or tremble at the vengeance of the gods
there 's going to be more war , more wretched combat ,
with them came terror , fear , and tireless strife , sister and companion of man-destroying ares— at first small in stature , she later grows enormous , head reaching heaven , as she strides across the earth
my own heart prompted me to do it
thoas moved in to close quarters , pulled the heavy spear out from his chest , drew his sharp sword , then drove it straight into the middle of his belly , destroying peirous ' life
to set me free , sent them clear signals
my dear child , which of the heavenly gods has treated youso nastily , as if you were committing some evil act in public ?
all your wealth or eat it up
that 's how true it is there 's nothing sweeter
for i am a man who suffers more
with immortal sea nymphs from the sea
to comb out wool and bear their slavery
ajax armed himself in glittering bronze
their numbers—from dulichium there are
by apollo 's silver bow in his own home
her sisters went with her in tears
stain you with lots of blood , and shove you out , send you packing from this house
he will suffer hardships , but in twenty days
how could he endure to perceive the echo of innumerable shouts of pleasure and woe in the wide space of the world night , enclosed in the wretched glass capsule of the human individual , without inexorably fleeing toward his primordial home , as he hears this shepherd 's dance of metaphysics ?
and once he would finished dinner , eurycleia
hermes the helper , going at once into her upper room in secret , had sex with her
i will lead the way
now , as it were , the olympic magic mountain reveals itself to us and shows us its roots
as he crossed the threshold , penelope addressed him :
to carry out revenge for agamemnon
and sandals for his feet
they dismounted and were welcomed joyfully
in a way no one would ever do ,
then on his own he set across his shoulders
then she called out to him and said :
on each side of the crowd they armed themselves , then both strode to the middle , prepared to fight , both glaring fearfully
where sun changes his course
told achaeans to plan on going home
about acting bravely with these suitors ?
i would make him ageless and immortal
he clutched a long-shadowed spear
pyraechmes led archers from paeonia , from far off amydon , by the axius , a broad flowing river , whose moving watersare the loveliest on earth
odysseus knew her from her voice , as she talked
stranger , you do not seem to be a wicked man ,
as he held his loyal and loving wife ,
but you can keep
high-thundering zeus , whose power is supreme
a married man but with no sons , was killed
idomeneus , seeing him clearly , dodged the spear , covering himself with the round shield he carried , one made of bull 's hide and shining bronze in rings , with two cross braces fitted on
it seems to me it 's zeus ' fault
they brought me here ,
but if my hands subdue you and you die , you will pose no problems for the argives later
men answered on the run
by dark waves stirred up by the west wind 's breath
but she did not reveal herself to him directly—
and inside the hall , with each man 's limbs
and thus whose udders were about to burst ,
with our own hands to roll from the high door
and his splendid son
he raised youas an infant in his home
charging through the gate and shouting at his dogs , he scattered them in a hail of stones here and there
i wo not miss my chance
they had trouble convincing him to go there— his heart was still so angry for his comrade
this process stands right at the beginning of the development of drama
she took with her that weighty , powerful spear—
so now , since i will not be returning home again , let me give this lock to warrior patroclusto carry with him
the sound of their lamenting filled the house
thus , among the assembled ships , mother and son spoke to each other many winged words
all at once , while he alone escaped from fate ,
or get the heart inside my chest stirred up
is some poor wanderer who 's just come here
we see that this book was burdened with an entire bundle of difficult questions
how could you dare come to achaea 's ships , and come alone , to rest your eyes on me , when i have killed so many noble sons of yours ?
her mother shared the same fate as that bird , the mournful halcyon , for she criedwhen apollo , the far shooter , seized her
by father zeus , athena , and apollo ,
the closely fitted doorway to this hall
i will not forget him , as long as i remain among the living , as long as my dear limbs have motion
sharp pain shot through his flesh
crowds of them came thronging in from all sides of the pit ,
of helen , something made by her own hands
and now , aelous , because he ’ s a friend of his ,
then poseidon moved on to the achaean camp
but come now , tell me—and speak truthfully—
they must all stand firm around the body , fighting hand to hand
were stored inside the hollow quiver
it did not miss , not even a single top on all the axe heads
that platonic distinction between and evaluation of the idea in contrast to the idol in connection with likenesses lies deeply grounded in the nature of the greeks
he came out , looking like ares
the god who slaughtered argus , mighty hermes , fell in love when he noticed her among the singing maidens in the chorus dancing for artemis , the golden-arrowed goddess in the echoing hunt
yet all this comes from you , the way you showfavours to these insolent men , these trojans , whose aggressive spirit has no limit , who can never get enough of battle , though they are not winning in an equal fight
once they would got there
as passenger , men who let you disembark
when you need him here so much !
i can tell you that my name is mentes ,
if heroes like goethe and schiller could not succeed in breaking open the enchanted gate which leads into the hellenic magic mountain ; if with their most dauntless striving they could not go beyond the longing gaze which goethe 's iphigenia casts from barbaric tauris to her home across the ocean , what could the epigones of such heroes hope for -- unless , amid the mystic tones of reawakened tragic music , the gate should open for them suddenly of its own accord , from an entirely different side , quite overlooked in all previous cultural endeavors
perhaps can tell me of his mournful death—
bad dreams as well
once he would killed his father ,
accordingly , we see that opinions concerning the value if the greeks for education have been degenerating in the most alarming manner since that time
do not let death weigh down your heart
who do not put salt on any food they eat ,
when every one of them had taken food and drink to his own heart 's content , nestor , the geranian horseman , began to speak :
they went there and , without any effort ,
i am here to learn the name of that wounded manyou drove in with
i manned nine ships
the suitors moved inside , laughing uproariously , and threw him words of greeting as they went
let there appear another sign from zeus
which had been damaged in some storms
for us , it is enough to have perceived that the essential charm , and therefore the genesis , of this new art form lies in the gratification of an altogether nonaesthetic need , in the optimistic glorification of man as such , in the conception of the primitive man as the man naturally good and artistic -- a principle of the opera that has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible demand which , in face of contemporary socialist movements , we can no longer ignore
and all the food he will eat , so he wo not ruin
aeneas strode out first , making threatening taunts , his heavy helmet nodding as he moved around
mingle with the suitors
until that time , no drink or food will pass my throat , at least , while my dead comrade lies inside my hut , mutilated by sharp bronze , with his feetstill pointing at the door , while his companionsmourn there around him
we all lay the blame for this on you
if a man honours these daughters of zeus as they come near , they will help him greatly , paying attention to him as he prays
thus these men kept toiling in the battle frenzy
every man then sacrificed to the immortal gods , praying to escape death and war 's killing zone
for men on earth about faithful penelope
but now you are last of all
i do not want to hit you with a sneaky shot , not a man like you , but in open combat , if i can manage it
you let approach the blood will speak to you and tell the truth , but those you keep away will once again withdraw
he also rules over the beautiful appearance of the inner fantasy world
and muses , nine in all , sang out a dirge ,
once the destroying fate of a harsh doom
when i would said this , she made the oath at once ,
the locrians were led by swift ajax , son of oileus , the lesser ajax , not the greater ajax , son of telamon , but a much smaller man
i reviewed these things in every detail ,
for i do not think you made it here on foot
if some man going past along the road upsets them by accident , they all swarm out with fearless hearts to guard their young—with that same heart and spirit the myrmidons then poured out from their ships with a ceaseless roar
skillful teucer then replied to agamemnon :
then alcinous responded to odysseus :
but now that the socratic culture can only hold the scepter of its infallibility with trembling hands ; now that it has been shaken from two directions -- once by the fear of its own consequences which it at length begins to surmise , and again because it no longer has its naïve confidence in the eternal validity of its foundation -- it is a sad spectacle to see how the dance of its thought rushes longingly toward ever-new forms , to embrace them , and then , shuddering , lets them go suddenly as mephistopheles does the seductive lamiae [ faust , lines ff ]
when he would drunk some blood , he wept aloud ,
where did you and your god-like companions
the dionysian musical enchantment of the sleeper now flashes around him , as it were , fiery images , lyrical poems , which are called , in their highest form , tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs
that resourceful man , replied to her and said :
they were dragging him off , as he roared aloud
young men , now you have entertained your hearts with tests of skill , so come inside the house ,
on this question classical antiquity itself gives us illustrative evidence when it places homer and archilochus next to each other as the originators and torch-bearers of greek poetry in paintings , cameos , and so on , with the assured feeling that only these two are to be considered equally the original natures from whom a fire-storm flowed out over the entire later world of the greeks
but telemachus moved in too quickly for him—
make sure your ship stays close to scylla 's rock
his skull , every bone at once
for the heavenly gods have given me
a pair of tripods and two silver bathing tubs ,
a word of omen , and here outside the house
with his long spear , and telemachus injured
tydeus ' son came across the king , the thirteenth man whose sweet life he had taken
this fine potion , which i will provide you , wo not allow it
me and my crew when scylla moves to strike
my child , what kind of speech has slipped the barrier of your teeth , when you declared
white-armed goddess hera agreed with what zeus said
they dragged him inside by the hair , threw him on the ground—the man was terrified—
steadfast thrasymedes stood holding a sharp axe
pallas athena had robbed them of their wits
but the happiest heart ,
he laced up lovely sandals over his sleek feet
with chairs and logs set all around
priam gazed in wonder at agamemnon , saying :
phylo brought a silver basket ,
he came to see me
meets them , they do not hide their true identity , because we are close relatives of theirs ,
the others reached the huts of atreus ' son
around her stood her husband 's sisters and his brother 's wives
leonteus then struck down in quick succession menon , iamenus , and orestes— all these lay prone there , on the all-nourishing earth
trojans had dragged the horse all by themselves
now , if we add the most important phenomenon of the entire ancient lyric , the union , universally acknowledged as natural , between the lyricist and the musician , even their common identity ( in comparison with which our recent lyrics look like the image of a god without a head ) then we can now , on the basis of the aesthetic metaphysics we established earlier , account for the lyric poet in the following manner
then once more over patroclus the bitter fight resumed—fierce and full of sorrow
but a single man kept on yelling out abuse— scurrilous thersites , expert in various insults , vulgar terms for inappropriate attacks on kings , whatever he thought would make the argives laugh
he 's begging me to go back home again ,
once i nod my assent , nothing i saycan be revoked , denied , or unfulfilled
no man could criticize a house like this
sarpedon , leader of lycian spearmen , lies dead , the man who protected lycia with his judgment and his power—slaughteredby ares on the bronze spear of patroclus
i am frustrated for myself
in two different groups , one where hyperion goes down , the other where he rises
in order to grasp this point , we must demolish that artistic structure of apollonian culture , as it were , stone by stone , until we see the foundations on which it is built
so even in death , your name did not die
shrewd telemachus then answered her and said :
and raise them well
set the child upon his knees and spoke to him :
she would packed it with cloaks and tunics , and woollen blankets , too—protection from the wind
went through the hall until he came to arete
nestor 's son peisistratus approached them first , took athena and telemachus both by the hand ,
for he had made the challenge , made it eagerly
night is passing quickly
showed everyone the truth
by setting out this historical example , we have attempted to clarify how tragedy surely dies away with the disappearance of the spirit of music , since tragedy can arise only out of this spirit
then the women went out from the hall , the ones
ajax dodged the weapon , but only just
many men live there , more than one can count ,
she set in place for her
he kept on trying to wrap some trojan soldier in death 's dark night or to fall himself , defending achaeans from disaster
while i was alive , you never did neglect me
then , with his bronze , he butchered those twelve noble sons of the courageous trojans , his feelings grimly set on this atrocity
surpasses that of every other human group ,
the hero became a gladiator , to whom people gave his freedom , after he had been well beaten and was covered with wounds
to bring them to a nasty death , then left
he began dragging paris off , back in the direction of well-armed achaeans
my words soon won them over
turning in all directions ,
my heart by then had changed—it now desired
down on the ground away from him , leaning it
hector , you other leaders , you allies , it 's foolish to think of driving our swift horses
and might make fun of him , which would bring me
godlike achaeans now could pause for some relief from the destructive killing of impartial war
now , since you keep me here , telling me to wait for your young master ,
for the sake of your offerings and the god
come , put that sword back in its sheath , and let the two of us
from somewhere else , that 's how odysseus spread the leaves to cover him
i will send some clothing here
fill the house all day
deucalion had me and king idomeneus
he let go of the spear and crouched there , both his hands stretched out
achilles slept in a corner of the well-built hut
through the doorway until he reached the courtyard and the portico gate
you should turn your passion into kindness , the hospitality of your own house
what gives your heart delight
when my royal mother has to leave here
when achaeans sailed back to their dear native land , then poseidon and apollo planned to erase that wall , by stirring up the raging power of all rivers flowing from mount ida to the sea—rhesus , heptaporus , caresus , rhodius , granicus , aesepus , the sacred scamander and simoeis , where many ox-hide shields and helmets had fallen in the dust , along with a race of people half-divine
by apollo , whom zeus loves , to whom you , calchas , pray in prophesy to the danaans , i swear this—while i live to look upon the light of day , no achaean will raise violent hands against you , no , not even if you name agamemnon , who claims he 's by far the best achaean
or are they kind to strangers ?
do not let these things afflict your heart
they placed it on the fire , poured water in it , and added wood below
for you maintain it 's not appropriate that someone else speak out against you , either in a council meeting or in war , for he should always back your leadership
meet the shade of teiresias of thebes ,
antinous was the only one to speak
but come , we will make you the same proposition—and we will deliver
resourceful odysseus then answered her and said :
that ’ s the reason earthshaker poseidon
where are you from ?
to boast above the bodies of the slain
beside priam , hector 's mother wept
against us , and they will send out messengers
for none could match his speed on foot , as he ran , chasing men in flight when zeus forced them to flee
the song which they have heard most recently
and when were we in greater need of these highest of all teachers than at present , when we are experiencing a rebirth of tragedy and are in danger alike of not knowing whence it comes and of being unable to make clear to ourselves whither it tends ?
between the mixing bowl and silver-studded chair , rushed out in person to clasp odysseus ' knees ,
on the seas at random , like those pirates
godlike theoclymenus then said in reply :
going back to our swift ship beside the sea
speaking the truth so i can understand—
in there lives scylla
so stop all this ,
at that point it was hard to recognize each dead man
in the rear , meriones roused the ranks for action
there boeotians fought , ionians in long tunics , locrians , phthians , and glittering epeians
unlike the old man afflicted with excessive suffering , a man who merely suffers as the victim of everything which happens to him , now we have the unearthly serenity which descends from the sphere of the gods and indicates to us that the hero in his purely passive conduct achieves his highest action , which reaches out far over his own life ( whereas his conscious striving in his earlier life led him to pure passivity )
i am afraid everything the goddess said
and eurypylus then slaughtered melanthus
but even if wide-ruling agamemnon , heroic son of atreus , is to blame , if he really is the reason for all this ,
but i worried about the horses—they would lack foragewith so many men all crammed together , and they were used to eating very well
i start to sweat
hippothous let go the feet of brave patroclus , allowing them to fall and lie there
but tell hippodameia and autonoe
it 's the brightest of the stars , but an unwelcome sign , for it brings wretched mortals many fevers
or will you change your mind ?
acorns , beech nuts , cornel fruit , the stuff
matches his ability to string this bow
did he take citizens of ithaca ,
but he should have prayed to the immortals—in the race he would not have finished last
taking no food—she would not eat or drink—
here , the lofty and highly much praised artistic achievement of attic tragedy and the dramatic dithyramb presents itself before our eyes , as the common goal of both artistic drives , whose secret marriage partnership , after a long antecedent struggle , celebrated itself with such a child , simultaneously antigone and cassandra
no one dared sit down , all terrified because achilles had appeared , after his long absence from that savage conflict
far from the sea , such a gentle passing ,
in the same way ,
one can guess from all this just where the great question mark about the worth of existence was placed
is a physician whose knowledge of these things
even though he is not here ,
she quickly took the looped thong from its hook , put in the key , and with a push shoved back the bolt
his heart was happy
knows nothing of all this , and neither do
dear brother , my father , my noble mother , and my comrades begged me repeatedly to stay there
the shades of suitors whom odysseus had killed
since he sat beside him and heard his heavy sighs
once he sent me here to bring away
and then he would have burned those well-balanced ships with searing fire on the spot , if queen herahad not set a plan in agamemnon 's mind to rouse achaeans with all speed on his own
its people have confidence in that
with your own head
to the borders of the field where the swineherd
but why do not we discusshow this warfare is going to finish up—whether we should re-ignite harsh combat , this horrific strife , or make both sides friends
from those suitors and their murderous pride
with a high box framed on top
now they are dead—and the man who killed them
is some mortal human driving off your flocks or killing you by treachery or force ?
looking like telemachus , she went all through the city
and now the vultures
i do not think he will give up
they spun out that destructive thread for men ,
i answered him and said :
you would not have seen a single argive there
then all those present reached for the splendid dinner set in front of them
many of us living on olympus have been hurt by men in our attempts to bring harsh troubles on each other
they furled the sail and quickly lowered the mast
medon was a bastard son of noble oïleus , thus brother to ajax , but lived in phylace , far from his native land
you understand my words -- as you will also , in conclusion , understand my hopes
and menelaus , who loved war , shuddered , too
i called a meeting and spoke to all the men :
two loyal companions , mecistus , son of echius , and alastor , bent down , then carried hypsenor groaning to the hollow ships
if a goddess had not felt pity for me
on my broad shoulders , he told me to set it
when argives saw hector carried back , they charged in , going at trojans even more , their battle fury roused
priam 's son hit menelaus with his arrow— on the front plate of his armour , in the chest
that would be better
that a man who would won much property
he even boasts about it—since achilles stays beside his hollow ships , anger in his heart
they thwart my wishto smash down those sturdy walls of troy
who , in the home of godlike odysseus ,
in winter , winds blow them down to earth , but then , when spring season comes again , the budding wood grows more
if some other man , some earthly mortal , had told me this , a prophet who interprets sacrificesor some priest , we would think it false , reject it
a lovely object , beautifully made ,
thinking of their common cause , he spoke out :
the dionysian greek wants truth and nature in their highest power : he seems himself transformed into a satyr
once we have killed these men , father and son , then you will be slaughtered , too , for all the things you are keen to bring out
to fetch the body of the dead elpenor
let him stay alive a while and suffer
but now , with his master gone , he lay neglected
all right , stranger , i will be truthful with you
odysseus led onthe cephallenians , soldiers from ithaca , well wooded neritum , crocylea , rugged aegilips , from zacynthus , samos , both those inhabiting the mainlandand those from cities on the facing shore
and will be here soon
let us but observe these patrons of music at close range , as they really are , indefatigably crying : beauty !
but then i was taken
so she could tell him everything , while his wife , his townsfolk , and his friends would not know who he was , until the suitors ' crimes had all been paid in full
and you can visit him—eurymachus ,
ever burned a sacrifice to you—
as he poured libations in his house ,
i spoke these reassuring words to him :
do not you want them to win ?
to lie down under blankets on a bed
gazing down from ida , the son of cronos made the fight an equal combat , so on both sides men killed each other
then antinous , eupeithes ' son , spoke out to them :
the two warriors then seized a chariot with two men , their people 's finest , two sons of merops from percote , a man skilled ,
she did not bring you with her servants
and also , should the need arise , on foot
you always love to work on things in secret , without involving me
athena then approached and fleshed out the limbs on that shepherd of his people
he did not dare protect his slaughtered brother 's corpse
he would been a wealthy man ,
should we not eradicate it forcefully from greek soil ?
getting in beside her , iris picked up the reins , then lashed the horses forward
and string it with the greatest ease , then shoot an arrow through twelve axes , all of them ,
will give me retribution
mighty polyphemus , as he stroked its back ,
waves were holding up
there are many of you and few of them
on anyone here who has not honoured
then from the deck picked up his powerful spear
but once he would seen odysseus after nineteen years , the dark finality of death at once seized argus
they pushed ahead , for there were two of them , both really keen to win , because they would set the greatest prize for that particular race
from under the yoke , his swift-footed horse called xanthus spoke to him , ducking his head down quickly , so all his mane streamed down from underneath his shoulder harness beside the yoke towards the ground
mentor , you mischief maker , your wits
drive forward , you horse-taming trojans
when archilochus , the first greek lyric poet , announces his raging love and , at the same time , his contempt for the daughters of lycambes , it is not his own passion which dances in front of us in an orgiastic frenzy
resourceful odysseus then answered her and said :
so he will give you a splendid ransom , if he learns i am by achaean ships , alive
to the female slave you esteem the most ,
to kill him , rip out his heart , and devour
had left my limbs
do not hold back from bringing to fulfillment
has stirred the spirit in my chest
the poet tells us this , a poet who fought throughout his long life against dionysus with heroic force , only to conclude his life finally with a glorification of his opponent and a suicide , like a man suffering from vertigo who , in order to escape the dreadful dizziness , which he can no longer endure , throws himself off a tower
they are restless , just sitting idly there
and shambling bent-horned cattle
helen carried off this robe , and they returned ,
make sure there are twenty measures of ground-up barley meal
when east wind and south wind rush down together from father zeus ' clouds to whip up the sea , the whole assembly rippled , like a large grain field , undulating under the fury of the storm , as west wind roars in with force , all ears of corn ducking down under the power of the gusts— that ’ s how the shouting men stampeded to their ships
will you never stop asking your questions
do they really bear the stamp of nature 's darling children who are fostered and nourished at the breast of the beautiful , or are they not rather seeking a mendacious cloak for their own coarseness , an aesthetical pretext for their insensitive sobriety ; here i am thinking of otto jahn , for example [ professor of classical philology at bonn ]
come here , friend , stand by me
apollo of the silver bow then made an image , a copy of aeneas , with matching armour , around which trojans and brave achaeans fought , hacking away at ox-hide covering their chests , at the round shields or smaller shields with fringes
to demonstrate that socrates also merits such a place among the drivers of the chariot , it is sufficient to recognize him as typifying a form of existence inconceivable before him , the type known as theoretical man
apollo slipped into the throng of fighting men
though he 's far off , cover him with glory now
hurry up and kill the finest pig there is ,
send favouring winds blowing stiffly through the air , so the ship could complete its voyage quickly
let a man go and get that sweet-toned lyre
she came out , opened up her shining doors without delay , and asked them in
immortal gods who dwell on mount olympus no longer disagree about all this
his hair was dirtied with the dust
and so they slept there in the palace vestibule , prince telemachus and nestor 's noble son
the most expensive one
go to the army
so bring two lambs here—white male , black female—for earth and sun
just as a carpenter 's line makes ship 's timber straight , when a craftsman 's hand applies it , a skilled expert in all facets of his craft , inspired by athena— that 's how tensely poised the fighting in that battle stood
with your skill in horsemanship forgotten
at such auspicious words
agamemnon , king of men , answered menelaus :
of other men before we got back here ,
then bright-eyed athena told telemachus
from the standpoint of epic this uneven and irregular word of images in the lyric is easy to condemn—something no doubt the solemn rhapsodists of the apollonian celebrations did in the age of terpander
patroclus drew back a little , evading the anger of apollo , the far shooter
be kind and give me some of that again
many relatives of his
dark-haired earthshaker , is that the messagei am to take from you to zeus , these harsh , defiant words ?
exactly where his midriff held his liver ,
but a home belonging to odysseus ,
so all day long until the sun went down ,
for a long time now , this must have been what zeus desired , and zeus ' son , the god who shoots from far , and all those who willingly gave me helpin earlier days
when death comes from the gods
that 's what he said
there he hammered out the earth , the heavens , the sea , the untiring sun , the moon at the full , along with every constellation which crowns the heavens— the pleiades , the hyades , mighty orion , and the bear , which some people call the wain ,
does he bring news your father 's coming ,
of every human being
he will get back home and take out his revenge
turning round , socus began to run
they gave me to a stranger they had met ,
she has thought up another stratagem :
the armour on his leg , newly hammered tin , gave out a fearful clang
but i always expected he would be large , a noble man , with enormous power
your libation and have prayed , as is right ,
in someone else 's house and do not dare
be my guide with the gods ' help , until i reach the hut of peleus ' son
her heart encouraged that so clear a dream
you do not join us , so we destroy these arrogant trojansonce and for all , along with all their childrenand their honourable wives as well
yes , my friends , believe with me in dionysian life and the rebirth of tragedy
as he spoke , he threw his tattered bag full of holes across his shoulders , hanging by a twisted strap
but when they ran past those springs the fourth time , father zeus raised his golden scales , setting there two fatal lots for death 's long sorrow , one for achilles , one for horse-taming hector
as diomedes finished , dolon was intending to cup his chin with his strong hand in supplication
while i was still a child , you suitors
once they were no longer pulling hard
fatherzeus , why is no god standing by me here , in this pitiful state , rescuing mefrom this river ?
which will separate me from odysseus ' house ,
in distress and late , in someone else 's ship , after losing every one of your companions
paris then killed menesthius , king areithous ’ son
and twisted it inside the socket of his eye
a pouch of food , as well
then the old man ordered his servant woman to pour pure water on his hands
you dear lads , fight no more
wo not shame your family
pandion also went , carrying teucer 's curving bow
so then , all day long until the sunset ,
for in this place the earth will cover me
she climbed up in the chariot , her fond heart suffering
and the life you lead is good
the men were terrified
and that 's why it is understandable that music is capable of bringing out every painting , even every scene of real life and the world , with an immediate and higher significance and , of course , to do that all the more , the closer the analogy of its melody to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon
she cried out , calling him—her words had wings :
i would have visited another mighty king
he 's near by and safe
the journalist , the paper slave of the day , triumphs over the professor in all matters pertaining to culture ; and nothing remains to the latter but the metamorphosis , often experienced by now , of fluttering also like a cheerful cultured butterfly , with the light elegance peculiar to this sphere , employing the journalist 's style
there are more of them , and they are braver men ,
but when they reached the ford across the swirling river xanthus , immortal zeus ' child , hermes left them and returned to high olympus
he strode off to face idomeneus , fiercely eager for this fight
setting her hand on the chariot yoke , the goddess said :
but as the days and months kept passing by
or if he does not know me any more ,
dear nurse , do not laugh at them and boast too much
it seems to me
huge waves with a dreadful roar smashing on dry land and foaming spray concealing everything—
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
i do not think he will grow up to adulthood
we must get back
the women added their laments
all-conquering sleep could not overcome him , as he tossed and turned , longing for manly , courageous , strong patroclus , thinking of all he would done with him , all the pain they would suffered , as they would gone through wars with other men and with the perilous sea
as he said this , warrior idomeneus dragged him by the feet through lines of fighting men
telemachus spoke to them with strength and power :
you do not want to suffer shame from aethe , who 's just a mare
for i clearly said odysseus should suffer much misfortune
here it becomes necessary to take a bold running start and leap into a metaphysics of art , by repeating the sentence written above [ section ] , that existence and thee world seem justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon
although athena hated him , he would have been saved , if he would not grown insanely foolish—
the men climbed in , went to their rowing seats ,
was that what made aegisthus brave enough
give me your hand , i beg you , for i will never come again from hades , once you have given me what 's due , my funeral fire
they quickly set him down in spacious lycia , his own rich land
on the other side , when patroclus saw him , he leapt from his chariot
minos then fathered worthy deucalion
next i saw minos , glorious son of zeus ,
the first to speak was white-armed arete , who said :
the spear hit ajax , right where two straps intersected on his chest , one for his shield , one for his silver-studded sword
then the shade of swift achilles
i have just heard myself to pass along to you ,
his well-sprung bow was there , and quivers , too , with lots of painful arrows ,
like a diver , off the ship
what you have just said is quite irrelevant
we can arrange the marriage contractby our seaworthy ships
but nestor , wanting them to stay , appealed to them and said :
he said he would slice off both our ears with bronze
my father 's calling for you
inside the spacious cave , every sheep and goat
and rolling in distress , i answered her :
the fruitful vineyard and from there continued down to the extensive orchard , where he failed to find
we sailed in there , dragged our ship on land , and walked along the stream of oceanus ,
i see this idea stamped out in that dreadful trinity of oedipus 's three fates : the same man who solved the riddle of nature ( the ambiguous sphinx ) must also break the most sacred natural laws when he murders his father and marries his mother
they answered him—their words had wings :
no more words from you abusing our kings , seeking to sneak back home
once athena had said this , achilles obeyed , rejoicing in his heart , as he stood there , leaning on his bronze-tipped ash spear
once he would said this , antinous turned on eumaeus , to reprimand him :
but eumaeus had no wish
all the gods you will offer perfect sacrifices ,
let 's move first—capture him out in the fields ,
what a cheerful confidence there is about these daring endeavors , in the very heart of theoretical culture ! -- solely to be explained by the comforting belief , that man-in-himself is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera , the eternally piping or singing shepherd , who must always in the end rediscover himself as such , should he ever at any time really lost himself ; to be considered solely as the fruit of that optimism , which here rises like a sweetishly seductive column of vapor from the depth of the socratic world view
then she called the famous artisan hephaestus :
that morning is already drawing near
the gods conducted me to ogygia ,
he spoke to his courageous heart :
when someone else runs into you and says
he can say i because he is the moving central point of that world
the helmet round his temples gave a dreadful clang , as he went down
patroclus then obeyed his dear companion
glaucus , leader of the lycian spearmen , was the firstto turn around
he had theoclymenus sit by him in the stern
to a follower of yours , and now you sit
obviously the degree of clarity in these men 's knowledge was the factor that designated them collectively as the three wise men of their time
when i looked around the hall , i saw the geese—
who has received from god the gift of song
just now i stated we would go back to troy today , once we would destroyed the ships and slaughteredall achaeans
and led me on my way
the enraptured horde of those who served dionysus rejoiced under the influence of such moods and insights , whose power transformed them before their very eyes , so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses , as satyrs
which of the gods incited these two men to fight ?
and make me his wife ?
and help my dear son grow into a man
the ones who disrespect me and the ones
have endured great suffering a long time over such a woman—just like a goddess , immortal , awe-inspiring
in this man 's form , apollo , son of zeus , spoke up :
a well-known reputation going there
down to the edges of the island , where tall trees grew , alder , poplar , and pine that reached the upper sky , well-seasoned , dried-out wood , which could keep him afloat
my friend , everything you say is true enough
save the son of clytius , just in caseachaeans strip his armour now he 's fallenamong this group of ships
take the one you want , the best of those in view
areilycus fell face down in the dirt
whoever you may be among the gods ,
both hosts and guest , can enjoy our feasting
ajax , worthy son of telamon , ca not you forget ,
and underneath the dark and sandy ground
obeying athena 's words , achilles relaxed his huge fist on the silver hiltand pushed the massive sword back in its scabbard
their bronze spear points glittered like father zeus ' lightning
if you are the two sons of antimachus , that hot-hearted man who , when menelaus cameas envoy once to the assembled trojanswith godlike odysseus , urged the trojans to kill menelaus , to stop him going backto the achaeans , now you will pay the pricefor those shameful actions of your father
six of my companions , right from the ship ,
the sightless prophet—circe 's words , as well ,
those weapons are no longer like the ones odysseus left
telemachus you boaster , your spirit
those which pass through the fresh-cut ivory
offer you delightful sacrifices
you have no spirit—you ’ re always brooding
trojans must not seize our ships and leave uswith no way to escape
and fifty-four feet high
when they reached the broad achaean army , they hauled the black ship high up on the sand , pushed long props tight beneath it , then dispersed , each man returning to his own huts and ships
so the mighty spear of warrior aeneas did not break the shield , stopped by the golden armour , a present from the god
holding up his sceptre , hector swore :
we have advice for you , if you will listen
the bronze spear point bit into his lungs
poseidon would get angry with us ,
about twice as far , i started shouting ,
whether he should do so openly or not
dressed him in sweet-smelling clothes , and sent him from the island
saying this , achilles reached out with his arms , but he grasped nothing
divinely raised antilochus , come here , so you can learn the painful news , somethingi wish had never happened
someone invested with enormous power ,
the instinct of aristophanes ( which grasped issues so surely ) was certainly right when he linked together socrates himself , the tragedies of euripides , and the music of the new writers of dithyrambs , hating each of them and smelling in all three of them the characteristics of a degenerate culture
my father , brave odysseus , over there ,
zeus ' harsh whip has lashed achaeans back , and your heart now wants to break our ships
could escape being killed
at troy who lost his chance to see the day he would come back
all your possessions for yourself as king
now , in that land , phorcys , the old man of the sea ,
trojans gave a shout
as for telemachus , you should use your skill
i have endured a lot in many wanderings ,
once they would come down to the sea and reached the ship , on shore they came across
leaving the others well behind , about as far
just as a man yokes oxen , big bulls , wide in the shoulder , to grind barley on a well-built threshing floor , and lowing oxen quickly flatten all the grain , that how brave achilles drove his sure-footed horses to trample on the dead and on their shields as well
come in the hut
or men who might have turned their island
and same , as well as those who lord it here
down the road or those who live close by—
he snatched agenor up , hid him in dense mist , then sent him quietly away from battle
for he looks like someone who offers prayers
the other man 's angry heart and spiritare checked , once he takes the compensation
be patient , for you must endure them all
and growing old , he would have given me
i have come back to sunny ithaca
they washed blood off with water and piled them onto carts , shedding hot tears
athena stood behind achilles , grabbed him by his golden hair , invisible to allexcept achilles
there lies great-hearted anchises ' son , aeneas , whom we honour as we do prince hector
a different route and chart another course , a scheme , i think , which gave zeus pleasure
at his own hearth
the deep swirling river had had sex with her
as soon as she appeared up on the rock
without being harmed , how his comrades slaughtered the oxen of the sun god helios , how his ship
it was a powerful victory of the non-dionysian spirit when , in the development of the new dithyramb , it alienated music from itself and pushed it down to be the slave of appearances
far from the city
their hearts did not lack a thing—they shared the meal as equals
in their swift ship and set me here in ithaca
the nightingale of the green woods , sings out
left to go up island
then she went away , leaving achilles there , angry at heart for lovely girdled briseis , taken from him by force against his will
by these ships the wall was lowest
arrogant men so recklessly have planned
or a haven from the sea
put clean clothing on your body , then go—
when telemachus and peisistratus reached
high on the wall they hacked each other 's armour— leather bucklers and large round shields across their chests , quivering targets
so , anger in my heart , i yelled again :
then he stripped the armour off the son of paeon , a famous spearman
what power was it which liberated prometheus from his vultures and transformed myth to a vehicle of dionysian wisdom ?
penelope laughed and quickly spoke these winged words to eumaeus :
armed sentinels went out , led by thrasymedes , nestor 's son , his people 's shepherd ,
that island has no flocks or plough land—
they killed plump swine , as well ,
come now , dear nurse , tell me the truth
anyone you met would call you blessed
is not morality a desire for the denial of life , a secret instinct for destruction , a principle of decay , diminution , and slander , a beginning of the end , and thus , the greatest of all dangers ?
then peisander struck , hitting glorious menelaus ' shield , but his bronze could not break through
glancing at the man who sat beside him ,
is not a good companion
from those he meets , for tonight at least
the gods display their love so openly
but i wo not comenear zeus , lull him to sleep , unless he bids me , asks in person
no sooner had he said all this , than amphinomus , turning in his place , saw a ship in the deep harbour
or were you killed by enemies on land ,
from every quarter , for cronos ' son
and on sweet wine
i hate like the gates of hell any man who says one thing while thinking something else which stays hidden in his mind
there he reached out with both hands for his companions
but why do not welie down and make joyful love together ?
from that i have had food and drink and helped out those who have a claim on my attention
i have come here now
son of atreus , why question me on this ?
her dear husband , until bright-eyed athena
went along as well
give me the truth , so i clearly understand—
come on then , go after them with speed , so we may capture nestor 's shield , whose fameextends right up to heaven—it 's all gold—the shield itself , cross braces , too
prudent telemachus then said in reply :
the heart in your chest
for a drink—the sun 's heat forced it down
that nobody destroyed my wits with wine
and there 's no point in prattling like the wind
planning desperate acts , wasting the wealth
that 's how the suitors talked
put into his chestsome nectar and beautiful ambrosia , so hunger wo not consume him
thus these two art drives must unfold their powers in a strict proportion , according to the law of eternal justice
she , a modest virgin , went upstairs , where the god lay with her in secret
some men stayed together in their seats , but others , more than half , jumped up with noisy shouts
he 's a bad beggar if he feels disgraced
for every trojan 's limbs were seized with trembling fear when they observed him there , swift son of peleus in that blazing armour , like man-killing ares
for the finest hearts can change
they joined their hands with his , and with their words they pledged their help
well , here i am in person—
take all the weapons of war lying there ,
great priam did not permit his trojans to lament
it is probable , however , that almost everyone , upon close examination , finds that the critical-historical spirit of our culture has so affected him that he can only make the former existence of myth credible to himself by means of scholarship , through intermediary abstractions
who will offer him some bread and cups of water
both forestays on the mast , which then fell back , and all our rigging crashed down in the hold
for soon the achaeans will attack you , all together , and cut you down
shrewd telemachus then said in reply :
myth alone saves all the powers of the imagination and of the apollinian dream from their aimless wanderings
then she could pour out on his eyelids and his crafty mind a deep warm sleep
then thetis , goddess with the silver feet , answered achilles :
up in the sky the sun has disappeared—
to be an athlete
glorious achilles , i am sure you have set your heart on destroying the city which proud trojans holdthis very day
but now especially be my friend , athena
and not a wedding feast
i agreed to give it to him
it 's what the old man swore , but you failedto bring about what he desired
gold statues of young men stood on sturdy pedestals , holding torches in their hands to give light at night for people feasting in the hall
that a single person should step forward at the beginning of a work and explain who he is , what has gone on before the action starts , what has happened up to this point , and even what will occur in the unfolding of the work , that would strike a modern poetical dramatist as a wanton , inexcusable abandonment of all the effects of suspense
you can beg for it throughout the country
i will prophesy what the immortals
whenever i get the urge to wipe outsome city whose inhabitants you love , do not try to thwart me
lord apollo , son of zeus , then answered hector :
in twenty cups of water , and the smell
now you must accept this splendid armour from hephaestus— no man has ever had such gorgeous armourto wear around his shoulders
shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
they obeyed at once
and speak to me as well
but let 's postpone discussion of all this
while there 's food and drink in our swift ship , let 's think of eating , so we do not waste away and die of hunger
antinous and eurymachus , both men
that 's how odysseus let tears of pity fall
no , scamander , the swirling river , will carry you awayto the broad lap of the sea
he bids you quickly arm long-haired achaeans , for now you can take troy , city of wide streets
beside the corded bedstead
i had to support myself
for telemachus , so we could capture
your death will come far from the sea , such a gentle passing ,
fishing with bent hooks , their stomachs cramped
then with both arms i paddled and swam off
laertes ' son , and carry them away
he 's not in his right mind , not in the least
wasting days and nights away with weeping
now he moved out to face atreus ' son agamemnon
her knees moved quickly as her feet hurried on
let him speak first
to pray to the gods , hoping one of them
and ask about them , you must deceive them
you have fallen in our hands
from sleep , approached them from odysseus ' house , and stood up in their midst
the child 's loving father laughed , his noble mother , too
beyond all other women on this earth ,
through its portrayal the lyrical genius sees right into the very basis of things
to make him hard for people to identify ,
your husband wo not get home—he 's in the house ,
the actor in this dramatic epic remains , in the most profound sense , still a rhapsodist ; the consecration of the inner dream lies upon all his actions , so that he is never completely an actor
could use it when they would bathed
then zeus put great power into pylians
but all of you must come here , even if not called by name , for you will feel shame and anger in your hearts ,
so did the dogs , as well
and noble honours given by the people
once he would organized the snare around the bed , he announced a trip to lemnos ,
next time i will beat him
trojans , lycians , you dardan spearmen , hold your place
so lord odysseus , who had endured so much , prayed there , while two strong mules took the girl into the city
map of the home states of some of the major achaean and trojan leaders
bearing in mind their common good , polydamas addressed them :
they live without a council or assembly
cydonians and three groups of dorians ,
tying it to the rock
then he will welcome him in an appropriate way
the ninth one was the mother of the batch
so listen , both of you
is always telling me to eat and drink ,
indeed , they must have felt even more that their entire existence , with all its beauty and moderation , rested on some hidden underground of suffering and knowledge which was reawakened through that very dionysian
a pair of clasps and a fine engraving
then cyclops once again picked up a rock ,
may recognize that we are about to fight
had washed the pebbles clean
or if , in his own presence , men armed with swords hacked down his brother or his son , as he looked on
diomedes then challenged two sons of priam , son of dardanus , both in a single chariot— echemmon and chromius
and no man born and no one yet to be
two stalwart followers of mighty zeus
we walked by these very trees
they did not run off
with a heavy groan , swift-footed achilles then answered thetis :
he knows nothing of our trouble , the great suffering which afflicts the army
more so than others
even for my own wife that 's dangerous
they collapsed in droves
dividing ithaca from rugged samos ,
let the call go outfrom heralds , whom zeus loves , through all the city , for growing boys and gray-haired men to campup on the city 's walls , built by the gods
all right my child , i will tell you the truth
do not you recall the time i strung you up on high , putting two anvils on your feet , tying your wrists with unbreakable gold rope ?
but hera , zeus ' honoured wife , was angry
if gods would only give me strength like that ,
at close range odysseus wounded damastor 's son
of someone else , and zeus awards them spoils
most powerful , mighty zeus , and you others , you immortal gods , may you make surethe men who first violate these oathswill have their brains spill out onto the ground , just like this wine , they and their children
amphigenea , pteleum , helos , dorium , where the muses met the thracian thamyris , and stopped his singing
there 's a fountain , with meadows all around
antilochus , you may still be quite young , but zeus and poseidon have been fond of you
he wound the veil across his chest , and then , with arms outstretched , fell face first in the sea ,
i , too , had my own ram , the finest one
when they would approached each other , at close quarters , great hector of the shining helmet spoke out first :
for lord achilles killed my father , when he wiped out thebe , city with high gates , slaying eëtion
the trojans roared out in response
do you think he will take me to his home
with these words , poseidon left , once he would explainedthese matters to aeneas
he was foaming at the mouth , below his eyebrows the eyes were raging fire—the helmet round his temples shook with menace , as hector battled on , for zeus , the god of heaven , was his protector , giving him glory and honour , though he was but one man among so many , for hector 's life would soon cease
then hector threw his bright spear at automedon , but since he was directly facing hector , he saw the bronze spear coming and evaded it by leaning forward
achilles , friend of zeus , you ask me to explainapollo 's anger , the god who shoots from far
it would not be appropriate for meto say no to your demand , since you sleepin the arms of zeus , the greatest of the gods
then he spied us and said :
i will tell you something else—
the rest kept fighting , with no let up in the noise
when they themselves are cowards—just as if a doe has put two new-born suckling fawns
shrewd telemachus then said in reply :
once he would said this , with his sharp bronze axe he chopped up wood for kindling , while others led in a big fat boar , five years old , and stood him by the hearth
hector with his glittering helmet then yelled out :
friends , i will tell you this ,
at the point where argives , having burned their huts and gone on board their well-oared ships , were sailing off ,
and never fail , while the sea yields up its fish
with his spear , tydeus ' son wounded brave agastrophus , son of paeon , on the hip
it 's difficult for one man ,
something he might give you for your house
around achilles , huge waves towered threateningly , beating down his shield
resourceful odysseus replied to him and said :
with fifty in each group
eumaeus , i will tell the truth , all the details , to wise penelope ,
and when he 's dead they all make fun of him
with this heroic push of the individual into the universal , with this attempt to stride out over the limits of individuation and to wish to be oneself a world being , man suffers in himself the contradiction hidden in things , that is , he violates the laws and he suffers
but when the two men had approached each other , moving close together , godlike achilles was the first to speak :
i may know him , a man like that
what laestrygonian antiphates had done
they all bit their lips , astonished that he would spoken out so boldly
i wish these suitors now inside our home
those fighting in the ranks in front , including glorious hector , moved back somewhat , as far as a long javelin flies when it 's been thrown by a man in competition showing off his strength , or in a battle with a murderous enemy— that 's how far achaeans forced the trojans to move back
he strung it with ease and shot an arrow
i took him to the house , entertained him
he looks as if he 's going to a dance , or if he 's sitting down right after dancing
pushed me off course , as i was doubling back
and , on the other hand , what if , to turn the issue around , it was clearly during the time of their dissolution and weakness that the greeks became constantly more optimistic , more superficial , more hypocritical , with a lust for logic and rational understanding of the world , as well as more cheerful and more scientific ?
to gods that you would see him reach that age
here they found soldiers hard pressed in the fight
alas , what great sorrow for achaea !
when they would made the mound , they started to return
when diomedes , skilled in war cries , noticed ares , he shuddered—just a man crossing a large plainstops at a raging river rushing to the sea , looks helplessly at swirling foam , and moves away—so tydeus ' son backed off then , saying to his men :
where are you from ?
hostile to their reckless acts—he was angry
i did not come to battle over herebecause of trojans
but now , on the basis of what you have just said , i find your thinking questionable
by plaiting them together back and forth ,
divinely born son of laertes , resourceful odysseus
sweet sleep then said in reply :
just as east and south winds challenge one another in mountain forests , shaking up deep stands of oak , ash , and tapering cornel trees , hurling slim branches one against the other , with tremendous noise as the branches snap—that 's how trojans and achaeans collided with each other in that conflict
some of them soon enough on their way home ,
in a difficult harbour , fleeing the storm ,
now it 's all happening
that 's how a prophet would interpret this , someone who in his heart knew the truth of signs
and smashed them on the ground like puppy dogs
leaning on his staff , his body dressed in rags
for in that choicewe find the joy which we derive from war
from crete , where the race of minos lives ,
now long-haired achaeans are mocking us , saying we have put forward as a championone who looks good , but lacks a strong brave mind
you have to tie me down with still more rope
for as i stay here ,
nine men in all stood up
to a deserted island , and left him there ,
they dashed off willingly , their spirits happy to be heading for the hollow ships
drink fit for gods
with this , she sped on through achaean ranks ,
she folded up the clothes , put them in the handsome wagon , harnessed up
with just one leap the man will get it done
the goddess , silver-footed thetis , set
they drove achaeans back , right back to their deep trench , hector at the front , proudly showing off his strength
this night before us
antilochus , no other achaean warrioris as young as you or quicker on his feet , or as brave in battle
in his heart she put courage and strength
but there , at the front of the herd , two fearful lions had seized a bellowing bull
then he set up , far off in the sands , the mast of a dark-prowed ship
to my own son—it would be better for him
bronze-armed achaeans , in admiration , may incite someone to fight lord hector
i think someday we will be remembering
already we breathe the air of a theoretical world , which values the scientific insight higher than the artistic mirror image of a universal principle
even zeus , who they say is the greatest of the godsand men , was blinded by her , when hera , a mere female , with her cunning tactics , deceived him that very day alcmenewas to give birth to mighty hercules , in thebes , city with the splendid walls
does not please all his listeners alike
where all the people passing by made offerings
telemachus , philoetius , and eumaeus
telemachus returns to ithaca
not when i have these sorrows in my heart
from people who had many rich estates ,
to eternal gods and remember me
then euryalus answered him and said :
i will go to the place where we assemble ,
old ones worn out with toil , young tender girls , with hearts still new to sorrow , and many men
but sits there groaning and wailing , in tears ,
many fell halfway before they reached white skin , skewered in the earth , still longing to taste flesh
in the spirit of this aesthetic the first experiments were made in the leading amateur circles of florence by the poets and singers patronized there
shrewd odysseus glared at him and answered :
in their hearts they were amazed
after these words , the two men lay down beside the road , among the corpses
none of them suspected anything
as he was thinking , phoebus apollo approached in the form of asius , a strong young man , horse-taming hector 's uncle , hecuba 's blood brother , dymas ' son , who lived by the river sangarius in phrygia
but now i grieve
you ’ re here because deathless gods despise you
i wo not be coming back ?
but go away for now , in case hera catches on
you have not visited—your home 's so far away
they all churned the water with their oar-blades , terrified of being killed
but he stood firm , like a rock—
then they went back to alcinous ' home to feast
and spread a fleece on top
i have come now because some people claim
for zeus was bringing us a wretched fate
and a master 's punishment can be severe—
my father and my family
you wretched creatures , where are you going ?
for a symbol of such a cultural form , we would have to set up socrates the player of music , in the sense talked about earlier
from far away , pallas athena added her voice , too , causing great consternation among the trojans
a broad-beamed vessel which can move across
i am dreadfully afraid for the danaans
alcimedon , what achaean warrioris better able to control and guidethese strong immortal horses than yourself , except patroclus , a man as wise as gods , while he was alive ?
you have no compassionfor your infant child , for me , your sad wife , who before long will be your widow
just like a silly child
your dancers were the best , and now , indeed ,
my dear child , will you agree to do what i ask of you , or will you refuse , because you are angry with me in your heart , since i help danaans and you aid the trojans ?
he 's not in trouble , but sits there in peace ,
you want to test me , old man , by asking me of godlike hector
on the cargo and his profit
from the city they soon brought cattle and stout sheep , sweet wine and bread from home
just as dogs and country farmers chase a horned stag or wild goat , but the creature saves itself in a sheer rock face or dark underbrush , and men have no luck finding it , but their shoutsattract a bearded lion to their path , who scatters them , despite their eagerness—that 's how danaans for a while continued to press on in groups , thrusting away with swords and double-bladed spears
recall your battle fury
rather than more wealth in gold or clothes
as the furrow laid down by a team of mules
forget being so amazed
once he would finished working at these tasks , he lit a fire
when they reached the ditch and towers round the ships , the sentries there were starting to prepare their meal
whichever one comes out victorious , the stronger man , let him seize all the goods , and take the woman as his wife back home
it 's hard to keep the families and childrensafe for everyone
my child , here 's a manyou seem to be neglecting totally , a special favourite of yours—achilles
of the rebellious giants
when i went there and his home sheltered me
singers win honour and respect
return back to the yard—they skip ahead ,
back on my native soil , for all i have suffered
a mid-sea course on the windward side of crete
any inner power or strength , not like
she looked like golden-arrowed goddess artemis
he 's asking to be sent away back home
she quickly reachedthe spacious home of hector , killer of men
now , from the acting area the clarity and solemnity of the epic form speaks to him ; now dionysus no longer speaks through forces but as an epic hero , almost with the language of homer
in the district , even when the dead man
menelaus , too , was troubled with anxieties
we would have had to sweat it out to end it
over there in troy
all of them , gave him gifts and filled his bag ,
your mother , hera , has an implacable , unyielding spirit
when you came here
so odysseus and her servants could keep up on foot
but he stayed behind , by his curved seaworthy ships , still enragedat agamemnon , atreus ' son , the people 's shepherd
they all sat there in silence , saying nothing
he sees more extensively and profoundly than ever , and yet wishes he were blind
and there perform as many funeral rites
if anyone hears groans inside this room
this tremendous difference , which opens up a yawning gap between plastic art as apollonian and music as dionysian art became more or less obvious to only one great thinker , when he , without any prompting from the symbolism of the greek gods , recognized the different character of music and the origin of all other arts from it , because music is not , like all the others art forms , images of appearances , but an immediate reflection of the will itself , and also because it presents itself as the metaphysical counterpart to all physical things in the world , the thing-in-itself as counterpart to all appearances ( schopenhauer , world as will and idea , i , p )
did poseidon stir the winds into a furious storm and strike your ships ?
why do you compare me to immortals ?
for these men pay me no respect at all ,
but you can stretch out here , in the house , putting bedding on the floor
when he set off for troy so long ago
until you reach your native land and home ,
oh father zeus , if you wished to bring me over land and sea
it is much rather a world possessing the same reality and credibility for the devout greek as the world of olympus , together with its inhabitants
and make the iron strong—that 's how his eye
those comrades i had trusted feasted there , eating the cattle they had rounded up ,
i told it to you and your noble wife
wounded by bronze spears , who would died in war ,
full of corn , was sailing to dulichium
so do not throw those long spears of yours at them , not all at once
it is a god who brought all this about
take this food , and give it to the stranger
beside them she then set up a polished table
and , like a fool , he swilled it down
they all fled back , once they would seen their king struck through the heart , lying there in the pile of bodies
resourceful odysseus , son of laertes and a child of zeus ,
diomedes was stripping the gleaming breast plate off the chest of strong agastrophus , taking , too , the shield from off his shoulders and his heavy helmet
saying this , she plunged into the crashing sea
he spoke to me :
he took up his weapons and spoke—his words had wings :
as the goddess said these words , she dispersed the mist
who surpassed all men in prophecy ,
he 's got one life , no more
no other wind sprang up ,
thus , you , above all , should speak and listen , then act upon what other men may say , if their spirit prompts them to speak well
the city and its land
and your name was mentioned in our home ,
neleus would not let me take up arms
many men had fallen down on top of him , when cronos ' son intensifiedfierce conflict
eumaeus looked around , then picked up a stool lying where a servant usually sat
from such a trip , over the misty sea ,
and fight with all his heart
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
in that existence as dismembered god dionysus has the dual nature of a cruelly savage daemon and a lenient , gentle master
made the journey home in the same day
then they stood up , dissolving the assembly by the ships
you yourself know it
my son , we must let this man lie here , for all our grief
agreeing with what he would said , they stood up and moved away
antiphates then raised a hue and cry
and , with their arrogance , they draw our wine ,
shrewd telemachus then answered her :
she made us lie down in a row and threw
each leader killed his enemy
lord odysseus would have killed still more lycians , if hector of the flashing helmet had not seen him , then gone through the ranks in front , armed in shining bronze , terrifying danaans
he left outside , in the open courtyard
as odysseus said these words , pale fear seized everyone
and spilling over , enough to clean one 's clothing , even garments really soiled , they took the mules
full of joy , carrying a costly present ,
so he has paid for everything in full
and our complete destruction 's plain to see
he showed me all the rich possessions
the gods gathered there in zeus ' house
for you to lean on , then give it me
he embraced the earth and kissed it—shedding numerous warm tears—he was so delighted
he fell onto his back down in the dust
feasting on that rich supply of meat ,
the joyful day of your return come soon ,
but then the troops came up with agamemnon , all together
and , with a nod of my head , ordering them
at that point we generally find a decisive secularization , a break with the unconscious metaphysics of its previous existence , together with all its ethical consequences
sent an attendant out to bring back presents
even men on foot were not confident about it
a full and proper sacrifice , and gods
for i am not hurt that agamemnon , the army 's shepherd , urges armed achaeans on to battle
over to a husband
and led the daughter home to be his brother 's wife
my heart has suffered , all those torments
resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
greedy beggars who disrupt our banquets ?
he stumbled and fell
it lasts all year long
on his bier , closing up his eyes in death ,
you ajaxes , both argive leaders , menelaus , leave that corpse to the rest of our best men , who will stand firm around it
who was just about to raise up to his lips
when dawn in her yellow robe rose from ocean 's stream , bringing her light to immortal gods and mortal men , thetis reached the ships bearing hephaestus ' gifts
to send me home
let her ask me then about her husband
they are crowding in the city , while you chase off on a diversion here
but before they left he sent me away
patroclus obeyed his dear companion
a nymph , a daughter of that phorcys
saying this , he turned away , thinking it shameful
but we have slaughtered
the finest in the land
this chorus in its vision gazes at its lord and master dionysus and is thus always the chorus of servants
i took great pains
in running fast and fighting well
as he was moving from the island thrinacia
he sees me first and , knowing all my plans , escapes me
in all sorts of ways , a courageous man ,
once they would reached the boat , they dragged the black ship into deeper water ,
he would come up from the sea and seated himself there , pitying achaeans , as trojans beat them back , and nursing a powerful anger against zeus
inside she met her many servants and bid them all lament
when fair-haired demeter was overcome
they gave a piercing cry which woke up lord odysseus
if somehow he 's a god come down from heaven
so they could be compelled to work for them
i cut back the foliage , by removing
i will return at sunrise , and i will bring you lovely armour made by lord hephaestus
my heart 's preoccupied with troubles now ,
was lost at sea
you come up to every man , one by one ,
they moved there and sat down on polished stones arranged in rows
but when achilles saw them , his anger grew
i wish that on that day my mother bore mesome evil wind had come , carried me away , and swept me off , up into the mountains , or to the waves of the tumbling , crashing sea
to flowing water and a towering tree
here we do not see any more the epic dissolution of the self in appearances , the disinterested coolness of the real actor , who remain , even in his highest achievements , totally appearance and delight in appearances
the old man finished speaking
great-hearted trojans i have just slaughteredwill rise again , up out of murky darkness , if this man 's avoided death , returned like this , after i would sold him off in sacred lemnos
all day long , the sail stayed full , and we sped on across the sea , until the sun went down
anyone who has sensed in the platonic texts the merest scent of the god-like naïveté and confidence in the direction of socrates 's teaching has also felt how that immense drive wheel of socratic logic is , at it were , in motion behind socrates and how we have to see this behind socrates , as if we were looking through a shadow
when companies of trojans hurled at me
what euripides in aristophanes ' frogs gives himself credit for as a service , namely , that through his household medicines he freed tragic art of its pompous hustle and bustle , that point we can trace above all in his tragic heroes
but if you are keen to hear them ,
i give him to you
to get back quickly to my native land
their crying and moaning echoed through the house
while much-enduring lord odysseus slept there ,
a picture image of the truth of things
what are her thoughts and plans ?
but say what 's on your mind
our hearts were resolute
friend , i myself am not all that eager
we have signs only we two understand
mentor has moved away ,
using his wise judgment ,
remote from me , so my dear wife could go
is there perhaps ( a question for doctors who treat madness ) a neurosis associated with health , with the youth of a people , and with youthfulness ?
using brute force in that hollow cave of yours
we will soon take him over to the mainland ,
when they reached diomedes ' well-constructed hut , they tethered the horses with cut straps in the stall where diomedes ' own swift horses stood , munching their sweet grain
hephaestus spoke , then stood up , passed a double gobletacross to his dear mother , saying :
they charged into a tamarisk bush and snapped the pole on the curved chariot , right at the very end
in a fight , even if a great quarrel comes
eurynome , though my heart was never keen before to show myself
that man began our strife
but come , speak openly and tell me this—
odysseus had described to her
zeus ' mind has changed
stretched out he covered seven hundred feet
but leave behind a pair of swords , two spears ,
come , patroclus , born from zeus , fetch the girl
hector was in the crowd there with them , grimly killing with chariot and spear , decimating young men 's ranks
once agamemnon spoke , the men stopped fighting , quickly falling silent
she reached for her son 's goblet
well , now i think you will pay for all you have done
going up to each man and reassuring him :
i am begging you , if ever in word or deed
instead , the sirens ' clear-toned song will captivate his heart
the most proper style of our aestheticians is to exercise their lame wits on such a collection and to overlook the phenomenon which is really worth explaining
and so for me
godlike otus and famed ephialtes
hector , you are right in what you say against me
the wide rumour of the suitors ' murder
hear me now—i wish to tell a story ,
for all the suitors
i paused , and he immediately replied :
will speed him on his way
their tears made the sands wet , men 's armour , too , for they were mourning the loss of a great warrior , who would made men flee
now the issue 's clear—either we will be killed or we will be saved , if we can push the danger from our ships
this view , combined with that historical tradition that originally the tragedy consisted entirely of the chorus , reveals itself for what it is , a crude and unscholarly , although dazzling , claim
they will honour him with all their hearts ,
so i moved back again , kept on swimming ,
her housekeeper , and said :
slain by cruel bronze , and pray to the gods ,
the whole floor swam with blood
my friends , stand by him , keep in your heartsyour sense of shame , in case the myrmidonsstrip off his armour and mutilate his corpse , in their anger at the dead danaans , the ones killed by our spears at their fast ships
i am on my way to inform warlike achilles of the newswhich geranian nestor , achaea 's guardian , asked me to report
until i finish all i need to do in here
circe , grant me the promise which you made
father zeus , you keep afflicting humans with great blindness
they had not been wise
but now he 's grown—his youth has reached its limit—
odysseus ' dear son rejoiced
to recognize someone 's inheritance
she does not turn down
to get weapons in their hands to fight a war
tell me the truth , so i can understand—
around his head and shoulders the goddess put a fiery glow , then drove him forward , right into the middle of the strife , the killing zone , where most warriors fight
if he bumped into us : who 's the man
and men say i am the finest of all goddessesin a double sense—both by my lineageand my marriage to the ruler of the gods
to receive a sacrificial offering to him—
in his black ship , back from sandy pylos
so euripides as a poet is , above all , the echo of his conscious knowledge , and it is precisely this which confers upon him such a memorable place in the history of greek art
or her previous husband whom she loved
for fine odysseus in the land of troy ,
to hades ' home , having made his prophecy
then stirred north wind to rage against our ships—
shaking his head , zeusthen spoke to his own heart :
why are you trying to irritate that savage ?
take good care of them ,
for atreus ' son would never make my heartso totally enraged here in my chest , nor would he take that girl away from me , so arbitrarily against my will , if zeus did not somehow desire the deathsof argives in large numbers
she went at the archer goddess , insulting her :
to think of ways to force these suitors out ,
hera went to the assembled ships , with pallas athena and poseidon , who shakes the earth
that will pain your heart to pay—your sorrow
shrewd telemachus then answered her and said :
would let a tear fall on his cheek for one whole day , not even if his mother and his father died ,
are not as steady as they used to be
swift-footed achilles , in a towering fury , then answered apollo :
he was totally despised by all the gods
on the opposing side , well-armed achaeans carried tlepolemus away from battle
old horseman peleus would cry with grief , noble counselor of the myrmidons
i do not fancy staying here unvalued , to pile up riches , treasures just for you
but when the girl was going to harness up the mules and start to fold the splendid clothes to make the journey homeward , athena , bright-eyed goddess , thought of something else ,
and they have won respect reserved for gods
the two proceeded on through weapons and black blood
rest in peace , patroclus , though you are in hades ' house
drink some sparkling wine , till hecamedewith the lovely hair draws you a warm bathand washes the dried blood off your body
for her first voyage
then i would be more beautiful and famous
who had not learned what courage is
filled up with chariots and infantry ,
until then the greeks had felt involuntarily impelled to relate all their experiences immediately to their myths , indeed to understand them only in this relation
went out and tied a ram and a black ewe
he spoke , then tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a large pillar , threw one end above the round house , then pulled it taut and high , so no woman 's foot could reach the ground
she provokes me so with her abuse
you must carefully select three comrades ,
his spear first struck him in the back , between the shoulder blades , as he turned to flee
both his head and neck were covered with the dung he would groveled in and grabbed up by the handful
son of peleus , do not try to scare me off with words , as ifi were a child
and set up their ambush for telemachus
where your lady mother and your father lived ,
antinous spoke , and what he would just proposed they found agreeable
i would smash his brains out on the ground in here , sprinkle them in every corner of this cave , and then my heart would ease the agonies
we heard all he said to you there in his house
telemachus , your well-armed companions
saying this , nausicaa cracked the shining whip
so the two men
o nestor , son of neleus , great gloryof achaeans , if a god wanted to , he would easily give even better horses ,
of shipwrecks or disaster
but when you see our son has grown a beard , then marry who you wish , and leave the house
that 's how the goddess graced his head and shoulders
for apollo , god with the silver bow , and ares ,
even though you are really shrewd
and control swift-footed horses , those things which soon decide the outcome of the fight in an impartial war
swift-footed achilles greeted them and said :
and came to the fine harbour where we found
there he gave them to his dear companion deïpylus , whom he esteemedabove all others the same age as himself , since they both thought alike
they were so terrified they dropped their weapons and all fell on the ground , at that goddess ' resounding voice
to rid your halls of them
but if what i say is horrifying and terrible , then the hairs on my head stand on end from fright , and my heart knocks
looks at a minstrel who sings enticing songs
great torments , which the shaker of the earth ,
i think disaster looms
by those swift dogs you yourself have raised ,
or any slaves in lord odysseus ' home
went through the house , head bowed , with foreboding in his heart , for he had a sense of troubles
just like a lion
phoenix , dear old father , noble lord , i do not need such honours , for i possesshonour in the will of zeus
ilioneus collapsed , stretching out his arms
when they would come to close quarters , facing one another , diomedes , expert in war cries , was the first to speak :
let 's fight and not hold back our spears , so we can see if achilles kills us both , then takes the bloodstained trophies to the ships , or whether you will destroy him on your spear
you gods that live at ease were jealous of her ,
troops from phylace , flowering pyrasus , shrine of demeter , iton , where flocks breed , antrum by the sea , and grassy pteleum— brave protesilaus had led these men , while still alive
if you are keen to infiltratethe trojan army , over there are thracians , fresh troops , new arrivals , furthest distantfrom the rest , among them their king rhesus , son of eioneus
he crashed on the ground and lay there motionless
in a contest with their bows
across the misty sea
it was your wife who hit me , father , white-armed hera
i was third in command , on their orders
there 's nothing i can do
go on your way
i received them both in my residenceand entertained them
and could the greek serenity of later greek periods be only a red sunset ?
of the very finest men , just because
but apollo of the silver bow had not been unvigilant , once he would perceived athena taking care of tydeus ' son
when i get back ,
using her judgment with the whip , she drove on
even in the world below zeus honours them
both of these universals , however , are , from a certain point of view , contrary , since ideas consist only of forms abstracted first from perception , rather like the stripped away outer skin of things , and are thus really and entirely abstractions
is put to the test between these suitors
as they were tasting samples of the innards
thus they talked to one another of these things
that 's where warlike ajax and achilles lie ,
like a vulture , meriones leapt out again , pulled the heavy spear out of his upper arm , then moved back to his group , but deïphobus ' blood brother polites , with both arms round his waist , hauled him from the fight , until he came to his swift horses in the rear
how must we derive this curious internal bifurcation , this blunting of the apollinian point , if not from the dionysian magic that , though apparently exciting the apollinian emotions to their highest pitch , still retains the power to force into its service his excess of apollinian force ?
which men will learn about in years to come
went off , as alcinous had ordered , to the shore
with these words he set into odysseus ' hands
it seems to me you know how to compete ,
sitting bolt upright , he said :
from that point , mount ida was clearly visible , priam 's city , too , and the achaean ships
to lord poseidon with a ram , a bull ,
when the sun had left the splendid sea and risen up into an all-bronze heaven , giving light to gods
but when wise penelope
his men followed , shouting loudly
now i am hurt and suffering , i am holding back ,
there he sits in front of his beaked ships , mourning his dear companion
to free your crew and entertain you
shedding many tears of grief
you ought to be ashamed
if indeed it 's true he is odysseus
all in due order , then spread the white sail out
the close-fitting door of that storage room
before now , you have not been too reckless or a fool
he stretched out his arms ,
he sent their diver back , grieving for his team
but it ripped apart two layers on that protective shield
and laughter-loving aphrodite left for paphos ,
tell me this , and speak straight and to the point
since odysseus went to wicked ilion ,
in this state , pure understanding , as it were , comes to us , to save us from willing and the pressures of willing
since there 's no greater glory for a man
on the opposite side , within the courtyard , were twelve roofed rooms , all made of polished stone ,
yet they heard me and followed my advice
just as when archer artemis
i will now set up this contest for the suitors
the strength drained out of him where he was standing
and give rash speeches
the old man then spied odysseus and asked :
looking at him , swift-footed , godlike achilles felt pity
to meet some well-known kings in an assembly—
because you overcame that beggar irus ?
with them came thirty hollow ships
or else you have found out from some other man
proud king oeneus had no living sons , and he himself was dead , as was fair-haired meleager
as he goes down to hades , the mighty gatekeeper , his heart , i think , will be pleased i have given him an escort
cloud gatherer zeus then answered hera , saying :
at this point , the trojans , having fled like deer , spread out through the city , resting by its sturdy walls , drying their sweat and taking drink to slake their thirst
sit down there , and wait a while ,
this moment marked the start of his final rush to death
at dawn idaios went out to the hollow ships
thetis , shedding tears , answered her son , achilles :
for he revered the gods who live for ever
by enemies on land
as troops moved up tightly bunched , men 's eyes went blind in the blaze of glittering bronze , glaring helmets ,
then went down to my ship and told my crew
divided up between them
gained strength , we held our ground and beat them back , for all their greater numbers
old eurycleia went up to an upstairs room ,
out from under the altar that snake slithered , darting for the plane tree , where there laytiny , new-born sparrows , eight fledglings , huddled under foliage at the very top
and speak candidly—was the place ransacked ,
he missed ajax , but hit leucus , a brave companion of odysseus , in the groin , as he was dragging simoeisius away
we moved down to our swift ship by the shore ,
how will i end up ?
to arrange an escort for your journey home
schopenhauer , who did not hide from the difficulty which the lyric poet creates for the philosophical observer of art , believed that he had discovered a solution ( something which i can not go along with ) when in his profound metaphysics of music he found a way setting the difficulty decisively to one side , as i believe i have done in his spirit and with due honour to him
in a wrestling match with philomeleides
dawn soon came on her golden throne
she mustered a force of volunteers in pylos , all keen for war
give me your armour to buckle round my shoulders , so trojans , mistaking me for you , may stop the fight
their meanings are not clear , and for people
when did he leave ?
so achilles gave the great sword to diomedes— the scabbard and the well-cut strap as well
are you really willing to leave troy , city of wide streets , for whose sake we have borne so many evils ?
when someone else runs into me and says
because he pitied me ,
where each met his bitter fate—but zeus ,
first , my noble father 's perished , the man
when goddess dawn rose high up on olympus , bringing light to zeus and the immortals , agamemnon bid the loud-voiced heralds summonall the long-haired achaeans to assembly
but the rest of the long-haired achaeanswill stay here , until we demolish troy
achilles lost his footing
raise the mast , spread your white sail , and just take your seat
if one of the achaeans wants to bring
but when agamemnon , hit by a spearor wounded with an arrow , mounts his chariot , then i will give hector power to kill and kill , until he moves up to the well-decked ships , at sunset , when sacred darkness comes
not to disgrace your ancestral family—
if you are keen to come , there 's no way i would stop you boarding my trim ship
he has no way of getting back to his own land—he lacks
they had no idea telemachus had gone
especially me—however far i travel ,
to serve the suitors , every one of them
for yesterday zeus went to oceanus , to banquet with the worthy ethiopians
to carry more fine armour from the storeroom
shall i speak up and pretend ,
you know it 's things like these that help to make a noble reputation among men
if odysseus himself had not called a halt and said :
report this message to achaean leaders—that 's the privilege of senior men—their minds must come up with some better planto save the achaean fleet and armybeside the hollow ships
they went away , and my heart was laughing—
once the thigh parts were completely roasted
once sunrise comes , the story will be out
fear gripped all the myrmidons
three times he yelled , as loud as any man can shout
then his noble mother movedbeside him , as he was groaning bitterly
they were discussingtwo alternatives , each one pleasing some of them— whether to attack that city and plunder it , or to accept as payment half of all the goods contained in that fair town
by our swift ships
even a grain of salt from your own house
the sail and yard arm dropped down into the sea , some distance off
he went to join the group of finely dressed achaeans
the shade of atreus ' son then answered amphimedon :
in your halls , as you just claimed
my lord , in this you must not criticize your daughter ,
lord odysseus , we went through the woods , as you had ordered and , in a clearing there , found a splendid house built of polished stone ,
when they have to face the pain and sorrow
it is certainly the sign of the breach of which everyone speaks as the fundamental malady of modern culture , that the theoretical man , alarmed and dissatisfied at his own consequences , no longer dares entrust himself to the terrible icy current of existence : he runs timidly up and down the bank
ajax slew laodamas , noble antenor 's son , who led up troops on foot
whoever in these circles has not completely exhausted himself in his endeavor to be a dependable corrector of old texts or a linguistic microscopist who apes natural history is probably trying to assimilate greek antiquity historically , along with other antiquities , at any rate according to the method and with the supercilious airs of our present cultured historiography
watching him , the father of gods and men pitied hector
and if your heart is angry about this ,
he came here with his armour—an amazing sight—huge and made of gold
indeed , it must also be historically demonstrable how that period rich in folk songs at the same time was stirred in the strongest manner by dionysian trends , something which we have to recognize as the foundation and precondition of folk songs
adreste came with her
once he would said this ,
things wo not change at alluntil the two of us go out to challengediomedes with a chariot and horses , until we confront him with our weapons
you are on fire with grief , faces wet with tears , fine pedestals and walls have gobs of blood ,
what else but the perpetuum vestigum [ the enternal mark ] of a union between the apollonian and the dionysian
they had to do—as if you yourself were there
for all my heavy groaning , since that storm
beside his brother thrasymedes and his father
the suitors reached out with their hands to grab the tasty food prepared and placed in front of them
with these words , the two men jumped out of their chariots , clasped hands and pledged their mutual friendship
achilles , peleus ' son , of all achaeansthe mightiest by far
we would sent hermes earlier to speak to him
may people someday say , as he returns from war , 'this man is far better than his father
and there 's no glory
and then provide the correct interpretation ?
for through their ancestry they stem from paeeon
i suspect , by contrast , that with our present worship of naturalism and realism we are situated at the opposite pole from all idealism , namely , in the region of a wax works collection
that said , pallas athena led off rapidly—
let each answer this question according to his own feelings : he will at any rate show by his answer his conception of culture , provided he at least tries to answer the question , and has not already become dumbfounded with astonishment
they then lay down to rest and took the gift of sleep
her nights and days always end in sorrow ,
a very strong affection for odysseus
then helen , goddess among women , said to priam :
while you turn to face the flowing rivers , looking backwards
poetry itself is lost with it !
you do not pity trojans as they are butchered
though i am in pain , i have told the truth in this
if i rush away before achilleswhere other men are running in their panic , he will catch me , then kill me as a coward
next , he placed the great anvil on its block , took up a massive hammer in one hand and in the other his tongs
godlike priam then said in reply to hecuba :
so he produces marvelous work , that 's how athena poured grace onto his head and shoulders , as he came out of his bath , looking like the immortal gods
and when we discussed our strategies
worms had nibbled on the horns
dreadson of cronos , how can you say this ?
stepped from the ship
he sent him roughly off with harsh abusive ordersthe old man went away again , enraged
as he went , he raised his legs high , striving against the current
in twelve days , when he returns and comes home to olympus , i will go to zeus ' bronze-floored house , clasp his knee
he spoke up at once , addressing the phaeacians ,
says she will be leaving with another man ,
telemachus visits nestor in pylos
that old man with still more troubles
the old man did not visit them to explain their dreams , for mighty diomedes slaughtered both of them
then melanthius the goatherd answered him :
in your home from tomorrow on , since you
a long way off , those same ethiopians ,
they quickly rushed away to get their weapons
so that this stranger , with us escorting him
that 's what i propose—let zeus be my witness
get lots of wood , so all night long , until first light of dawn , we can burn many fires , lighting up the sky
or go off with the best of those achaeans
eumaeus , i hope father zeus likes you
for there 's no benefit in frigid tears
my spear has sent you running once before
and these actions will consist , for the most part , like those of a mid-wife , of things concerned with the education of noble disciples , in order to produce an endless supply of geniuses
is more painful still—it could not save him
well known to all for my deceptive skills—
dark blood flowed down
or a stupid man , if you have in you now
zeus then boasted openly to all the gods ,
someone on a distant farm without a neighbour
discovered the plump seals , looked at each one ,
silver , and ivory , and then across it
then i can pass through the gates of hades
antilochus , you have not paid that tribute here for nothing
to take some bread and offer it to me
my bridal room , and my own husband , too ,
still , i am not chasing anyone away
teucer hit him with an arrow on the gleaming strap around his chest which held his protective shield
the dithyrambic chorus is a chorus of transformed people , for whom their civic past , their social position , is completely forgotten
and so right there the first philosophical problem posed an awkward insoluble contradiction between man and god and pushed it right up to the door of that culture , like a boulder
swift ajax , son of oïleus , was the first to recognize the god
if they do not pay me proper retribution
but when we would ransacked priam 's lofty city
the godlike minstrel honoured by his people ,
be prudent , kind , or gentle from now on ,
he had such shabby clothing covering his body
then helen , long-robed goddess among women , answered :
on the other hand , by means of the same tragic myth , in the person of the tragic hero ; it knows how to redeem us from the greedy thirst for this existence , and with an admonishing gesture it reminds us of another existence and a higher pleasure for which the struggling hero prepares himself by means of his destruction , not by means of his triumphs
shipmates , although you are suffering distress , hear me out
he really stirred the heart of warlike peneleus
has set off in a hollow ship—poor child—
she would given him both bad and good , for she would destroyed his eyes , but had bestowed on him the gift of pleasing song
who kept assigning me the harshest tasks
she made no attempt to use her fingers
as old men should
so these two looped the cords of powerful war and deadly strife around both contending armies , then pulled them taut , a knot no one could undo or slip away from , a knot that broke the limbs of many fighting men
no matter who he was or what he needed
he may reach dawn with her golden throne
bound for cyprus , dmetor , son of iasus ,
but euphorbus , son of panthous , with his ash spear , also knew that brave patroclus had been killed
around it on both sides
i wish i could hide him from distressful death , when his cruel fate arrives , as surelyas i know there will be fine armour for him— such splendid armour that it will astoundall the many men who chance to see it
you must have a strong desire to die ,
of lotus-eating men , and all the cyclops did—
i am holding you back with my delay , not coming as quickly as you asked
we really thought he would killed us there
running over , he took up a position by both ajaxes and said :
the men kept toiling on without a pause , sweat dripping on their knees and legs , under their feet , and running down men 's eyes and hands , as both sides battled over swift-footed achilles ' brave companion
taking her female servants to her room upstairs
take a golden cord , hang it from heaven
on the string , as if prepared to shoot
so come , no longer show me such ill will
am not unskilled in competition ,
we have no special gift
and then a great omen appeared , a snake , blood-red along its back , a dreadful sight , a thing sent out by zeus into the daylight
in the presence of immortal gods
and just as tragedy , with its metaphysical consolation , draws attention to the eternal life of that existential core in the continuing destruction of appearances , so the symbolism of the satyr chorus already expresses metaphorically that primordial relationship between the thing-in-itself and appearances
this morning early , a wagon and some mules ,
i do not blame any olympianas much as i blame my own dear mother , who led me astray with lies , telling mei would die from the swift arrows of apollo , under trojan walls and fully armed
the bow fell from his hands
those phoenicians , truly crafty men , seduced her
one of his horses had been hurt , hit by an arrow on its head , right on top , that spot where on a horse hairs begin to grow out from the skull , a deadly place
talthybius swung the body round , then threw it in the vast gray sea , food for fish
so it followed a straight line
and fell out , a long way from the raft
that land is where she said i would be saved
the phaeacians , so celebrated for their ships ,
tell me , who 's that large man , over there , that impressive , strong achaean ?
and explained its features
they agreed with what he would said
the worthy swineherd had picked up the curving bow and was carrying it
the finest in my flocks
just as from a high peak of some massive mountain , zeus , who gathers lightning , shifts a bulky cloud , once more revealing all the peaks , high headlands , and mountain glades , while from heaven the huge bright sky
meanwhile , aphrodite and apollo , with his silver bow , are enjoying themselves , happy about this madman they have unleashed , who has no sense of what 's appropriate
no longer exercise their power , slaves
muse , tell me this—which of them were the very best of those who came over with the sons of atreus ?
a word from you
on the other side , higher up the sloping plain , the trojans did the same
in well-stitched leather sacks
so give back argive helen and her property , compensate us with a suitable amount , something future ages will all talk about
i will go to sparta , land of lovely women ,
i am always going in among the trojans , and i claim i do not malinger by the ships , although i am an old man for a warrior
the way i would a god , and i have come here
and sat me on a silver-studded chair ,
together with eumaeus and philoetius
then splendid hector , calling with a shout , announced that he would come forward to confront achilles
still , though it hurts , we should let all this pass , repressing hearts within our chests—we must do that
you who rule on high , yes indeed , aegisthus
the blow from zeus ' lightning made our boat
since i first left the mountain snows of crete ,
but with a spear , that 's more difficult—they are so much stronger
the immeasurable suffering of the brave individual , on the one hand , and , on the other , the peril faced by the gods , even a presentiment of the twilight of the gods , the compelling power for a metaphysical oneness , for a reconciliation of both these worlds of suffering—all this is a powerful reminder of the central point and major claim of the aeschylean world view , which sees fate ( moira ) enthroned over gods and men as eternal justice
helped me stand again , and brought me home ,
you would fight any man you saw avoiding battle , fleeing war 's brutality
while the men kept on fighting at the well-decked ships ,
i offered many prayers , with promises
we will be successful in what we are doing
wise eurycleia , telemachus is telling you to lock up
and his many wanderings , will come home
the battered timbers on the tower rattled
when cows , having had their fill of grazing ,
you will not come up with other devious plans
at hermes ' words , laughter arose from the immortal deities
such beautiful prizes in your honour
a large , fine place , with cleared land all around
hector , here the two of us mingle with danaans , but on the outskirts of this hard-fought battle
there will be stories for telemachus and i
the axle was completely spattered underneath , as were the rails behind , with gobs of blood thrown up from horses ' hooves and chariot wheels
with coverlets spread over them , and then ,
dear nurse , the gods have made you mad
glossary of people and places
on her head she placed a double-ridged gold helmet , men from a hundred cities etched upon its four-part crest
what sophocles said about aeschylus—that he does what 's right , without being aware of it—was certainly not said in any euripidean sense
the truth about this , too , so i understand—
flying off in a rush , the two gods reached ida with its many springs , mother of wild beasts
while his mother was coming down mount ida , accompanying her parents to watch their flocks
i will go straight through the army , till i reachagamemnon 's ship , where their best menmust be in council talking of their plans , whether to flee or to continue fighting
for agamemnon had ordered him repeatedly to keep the horses ready for the time his limbsgrew tired from moving through so many soldiers
from his friends and native land much longer
they came up through the crowd answering their comrade 's shout
but fate had overtaken him by now
heralds poured water out for them to wash their hands ,
weaving a huge , immortal tapestry ,
in splitting dry wood and building a good fire ,
i have come back to my native land
it 's a nasty thing to accept a pledge
will be so overcome with foolishness
to prepare a banquet
in its great subtlety would not let me speak
you can describe the details to your wife
his herders and his ploughman will not needto travel to the town through lack of iron
perhaps the charioteer let go the reinsand could not guide his chariot round the postand failed to make the turn
gone limp—that 's how irus is now sitting
they got in at once , moved to the rowing bench ,
but there is something much worse about my book , something which i regret even more than to have obscured and spoiled my dionysian premonitions with formulas from schopenhauer : namely , that i generally ruined for myself the magnificent problem of the greeks , as it arose in me , by mixing it up with the most modern issues !
my myrmidons , let none of you forget those threats you spoke about by our swift ships , while i was angry—you would go on and on against the trojans
the spirit of agamemnon , son of atreus ,
by a spear in the strong hand of telemachus
that man is laertes ' son , crafty odysseus , raised in rocky ithaca
for reality , the world of separate things , supplies clear phenomena , remarkable and individual things , the single case , to both the universality of ideas and the universality of melodies
to ambush this divine old man , in case
i am just a beggar
but when the dogs disfigure shamefullyan old man , chewing his gray head , his beard , his sexual organs , that 's the saddest thing we wretched mortals see
i was a son of zeus , child of cronos ,
you might well die , come to a quick end on his spear
of fresh-carved ivory which fits around it ,
they stood in fair-haired circe 's gateway
let 's start—fight on , whether for victory or flight
yes , this dog belongs to a man who died
we can repay ourselves—
would send other troubles , since my mother ,
abandoning me to tears and sorrow
by our ships lies a dead man—unwept , unburied—patroclus
next resilient , godlike odysseus tried a lift
schedius and epistrophus , sons of iphitus , the son of great-hearted naubolus , commanded phoceans—men from cyparissus , rocky pytho , holy crisa , daulis , and panopeus ; men from anemorea and hyampolis ; from around the sacred river cephisus , from lilaea , beside cephissus ' springs
our ship then reached the boundaries of deep-flowing oceanus ,
will pay them back
a cloak and tunic
and how to sail across the fish-filled seas
with no sense of law , or kind to strangers , with hearts that fear the gods
as a young girl carrying a pitcher
this impartial war , in case thundering zeus ,
a bad dream had stood beside his head that night , a device sent by athena—and that dream was the son of tydeus
hector and the trojans , with a shout , threw volleys of lethal weapons at them
think of zeus 's rage
move close and dig a hole there two feet square
closely linked by marriage
and to whom she borne a child , even if
i regret that i tied myself to hopes where there was nothing to hope for , where everything indicated all too clearly an end point !
they fought lord hector and the trojans spear for spear , shield with layered shield , in close-packed formation , shields linked together and helmet touching helmet , troops shoulder to shoulder
attempting to catch anyone who tried
and great spear fighters , too
sitting high above them , zeus stayed in control
has gone to gather news about his father ,
on his bent limbs , the hairs stood out , and he stayed there in a daze
and left for aegae where he has his splendid home
he called out to the trojans , shouting :
you are the one who is especially loyal
the son of tydeus jumped down onto the ground ,
blowing from behind our dark-prowed ship—
you never stop working
antinous , there 's no way i will dismiss
beggars and vagabonds are like
got back to his native land , he and his son
old man , no wanderer who came with news of him
let whoever'sgoing to getthe two-handled cup step forward
idomeneus , above all danaans , with their swift horses , i value you in war , in all other things , and at banquets , when achaea ’ s finest prepare gleaming wine , the kind reserved for kings , in mixing bowls
here we must think clearly of the tremendous power that stimulated , purified , and discharged the whole life of the people : tragedy
melampus was caught trying to help his brother and imprisoned by phylacus , but his prophetic powers persuaded phylacus to release him and give him the cattle
has permitted them , for their ships move fast ,
i would rather lose my life once and for all
the son of peleus ' shade
once they reached the splendid palace of the king , they sat down in rows on high-backed chairs and couches
he spoke out at once to his phaeacians ,
but achilles checked them , keeping soldiers there
but now science , incited by its powerful delusion , speeds on inexorably right to its limits , at which point the optimism hidden in the essence of logic fails
no man can match your expertise in that
you are both younger men than i and i have been colleague of better men than you , men who never showed me any disrespect , men whose like i have not seen again , and never will—like peirithous , dryas ,
towards the gloomy darkness in the west—
she called her husband ,
a god came down in person—for he could ,
while in his mind and heart he turned this over , ranks of shield-bearing trojans advanced against him , encircling him
he has no bed or bedding—no cloaks
but eurycleia 's words could find no wings
he would not let them stand up on the earth
warrior phaedimus , the sidonian king , presented it to me on my way home ,
i saw lord mentor , though by that time
he was crude and rough , but now he seems
be willing now to stand by me like that , protect me , and i will sacrifice to youan unbroken yearling ox with a broad headwhich no man yet has put beneath the yoke
to high olympus , petitioning zeus ,
that 's what the suitors said
there 's no man to guard our home from ruin ,
so jump out there—see if you can hit one of the trojans
so there 's no onewho will keep the dogs from going at your head , not even if they bring here and weigh outa ransom ten or twenty times as much , with promises of more , or if priam , son of dardanus , says he will pay your weightin gold
thus , we forced her to complete the cloak
of a malicious woman
the din of smashed-in shields , gates , and horsehair helmets—that sound reached heaven
the keen arrow dug into the leather strap , passed right through the finely decorated belt , through the richly embossed armour , the body mail , his most powerful guard , worn to protect his flesh , by blocking spears and arrows
today , one of them will mourn a dear dead son
and zeus sent blustery west wind blowing in with rain , a steady downpour all night long
it 's that time of day
menelaus shouted , but antilochus kept going , moving even faster and laying on the whip , as if he had not heard
the one whom leto bore , killed both of them ,
which he kept there as a change of clothing ,
the herdsmen walking by the cattle , four of them , were also made of gold
with all his gifts , he 's bringing pleasureto the gods who live in spacious heaven
podarcus was iphicles ’ son , child of phylaces
may gods give you joyful prosperity
but i had one left , guardian of our city , protector of its people
come on , some of you get busy here—
but now hector was striving to break through the warriors ' ranks , probing them wherever he saw the largest groups , the finest armour
his fat flock right inside the spacious cavern ,
with these words , the goddess led her inside the house
a slur on us
inside the home the sicilian servant woman
they soon reached the scaean gates
i will carry out what you have told me
for odysseus was not the only man
your chariotand your horses are not here
with just a tunic
the answer to my many prayers , fleeing poseidon 's punishment from the deep sea
the attractive farms of the egyptians ,
he moved back into the ranks , among his comrades , avoiding death
earthshaker , you would never call me prudent , if i fought with you over human beings—those pitiful creatures are like the leaves , now full of blazing life , eating nourishment the earth provides , then fading into death
of anger from the gods , in case their rage
i am returning now to windy troy
because the day they meet their fate has come
once they would washed the clothes and cleaned off all the stains , they laid the items out in rows along the sea shore , right where the waves which beat upon the coast
other gods will follow our example
as i slept , a dream sent from the gods
flocks of sheep and shambling bent-horned cattle
then atreus ' warrior son handed telemachus
i have had no practice with such formal speech
and threw it on the fire
so we could get away from this disaster
euripides is the actor with the beating heart , with his hair standing on end
at banquets , when we achaeans feast our senior men , you hear me call your name out first
all his companions , before returning home
and they ran off in fear and crouched down here and there among the jutting dunes of sand
the shuttle fell out of her hands onto the floor
but the public , including the best individuals among them , met him only with a suspicious smile
but should zeus , who sees far and wide , not send that messenger , i would not urge you or advise you go there , to achaean ships , for all your eagerness
one , which faces north wind , is the one men use
they gave me a really tiny portion
a desire to lament arose in both of them—
or whether we should seek out other men
though you are a brave man , god-like achilles , do not encourage achaea 's sons to fightagainst the trojans on empty stomachs
but i am ashamed to drive her from the home
in all the herds , to serve as dinner for the suitors
and hears the sirens ' call never gets back
grief overwhelmed the suitors
then , odysseus , you will see the other cliff
i am no prophet and have no sure skills
spoke to him—his words had wings :
and the sun get hot
then prudent telemachus replied :
alas , athena , child of aegis-bearing zeus , tireless one , we have made an empty promise
or listen to my words when i asked him
we can deal with that
if some god made sure our fight was equal , he would not easily defeat me , even thoughhe boasted he 's completely made of bronze
but when swift achilles killed my husband , you would not let me weep
you have already got men from this country
and send you where your heart and spirit urge
by the door post of the hall , leaning from her seat to spin fine threads of yarn
after saying this , iris left
and now all this
leaning his chair against a lofty pillar
this attempt to scale the heights of heaven is part of the famous stories of the war between the giants and the olympian deities
one butchers in its stall
until he reached the massive cave , where calypso , the fair-haired nymph , had her home
it 's just not fair that you , our leader , have botched things up so badly for us , achaea 's sons
you phaeacians counselors and leaders ,
which made sorrow come to us as well
you dear gods , what a day this is for me !
most likely to completely wreck our ship ,
approve the act , i myself will kill him
trembled as she spoke to him—her words had wings :
alcimedon , make sure you keep the horses close to me , so they breathe right on my neck
will get this far or throw it further
until he would reached the swift ships and the huts—
this in your heart—you control the steering on this hollow ship
then the sun went down , and all the roads grew dark
i groaned and cried out to immortal gods :
why try to scare the argives ?
then the godlike singer took his hollow lyre
that reflection , which lacks imagery and concepts , of the original pain in music , together with its redemption in illusion , gives rise now to a second reflection as the particular metaphor or illustration
and after that another proud young man would say :
shall i stay there with them , wait for you to come , or hurry back to you , once i have told them your instructions ?
listen to me , men of ithaca
their eyes filled up with tears
from the rocky lookout
at once i was the firstto recommend we all appease the god
he was coming backfrom oechalia , from the court of eurytus the king
he suffered badly , until he came to rhodes , whose people live in three groups split by tribes
let 's now imagine that one great cyclops eye of socrates focused on tragedy , that eye in which the beautiful madness of artistic enthusiasm never glowed—let 's imagine how it was impossible for that eye to peer into the dionysian abyss with a feeling of pleasure
and sailors ' hearts tell them to go on board
that subjectively willing and desiring man archilochus can never ever be a poet
saying this , thetis turned away from her own sonto address her ocean sisters :
lady , it 's quite impossible to twist another meaning from this dream ,
do not we have enough apart from him ,
i wish i would got you low down in the gut , taken your life
with their excessively garish and motley collection of styles , weaving back and forth between prose and metrical forms , they produced the literary image of raving socrates , which they were in the habit of presenting in their own lives
with sponges , clean up the mixing bowls ,
we sailed away from there , hearts full of grief at losing loyal companions , though happy
but now , i will never welcome him back home again , returning to the house of peleus
he prayed to apollo , who loved him well
no blame attached itself to you by waiting ,
who would just come back from wandering around
and their indefatigability makes me think that perhaps they are not aesthetically sensitive at all , but react merely as moral beings when listening to a tragedy
euryalus killed dresus and opheltius , then charged after aesepus and pedasus ,
was like the gods '
his courage will profit no one but himself
i have got something to say
it 's the interior of zeus ' home
behind them , came autolycus ' sons , with lord odysseus
once they reached laertes ' well-furnished home , they found
each one brought his dead outside the house and buried them
now in the twentieth year , after suffering through numerous ordeals ,
but proetus , in his heart , plotted against him , driving him from argos , being much stronger , for zeus had given royal power to proetus
in the plain , some distance off , a high hill stood by itself , right before the city
and returning home , i could hold out here
then both sides reinforced their ranks—trojans and lycians , achaeans and myrmidons
it 's better to settle this once and for all—whether we live or die—than be hemmed in , fighting a long grim battle , as we are now , among our ships against inferior men
but still , though you will suffer badly , you may get home , if you will curb your spirit and your comrades
so they set off , led by agamemnon , king of men
because he 's now a man , quite capable
to accept that , if zeus gave it to me
let everyone in troy be slaughtered , without pity , without leaving any trace
and zeus ' child , if it 's against your will , you should not now remain here in my house
nine heralds shouted out instructions , attempting to control the noise , so men could hear their leaders , god 's chosen ones
hearing these words , both men agreed
in fact , it could be the case that for the aryan being this myth has the same defining meaning as the myth of the fall has for the semitic peoples , and that both myths are , to some degree , related , as brother and sister
was turning over many gloomy thoughts
it took us more than seven years
as she pursues wild boars and swiftly running deer ,
and if they would reached their full-grown height as men ,
or with the swineherd
one of them would say something like this :
then his long sword slaughtered many trojans ,
cyclops , if any mortal human being
which you now , in your arrogance , display ,
but hera , afraid for achilles , cried out , fearing the great , deep , swirling river would sweep him off
with these words , he pushed the ram away from him , out through the door
othryoneus , of all mortal men i would consider youthe happiest , if you would accomplished all those things you promised dardan priam , so he would give you his daughter
resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
how else could a people so emotionally sensitive , so spontaneously desiring , so singularly capable of suffering have endured their existence , unless the same qualities manifested themselves in their gods , around whom flowed a higher glory
telemachus hangs the servant women from
hear me , poseidon , you who enfold the earth—
while i was still alive , with no fear of the gods , who hold wide heaven , or of any man
but there was no way athena would permit
he often served you well—both your city
the rest of the danaans hector left alone , not killing any of them
just as doves or long-winged thrushes
when his own life 's at stake—and we were faced
first , with an ointment made from ambrosia she cleaned her lovely face ,
then from your thigh , you must yourself draw that sharp sword out , and , sitting there , prevent the powerless heads of those who have died from coming near the blood , until you have listened to teiresias
hector led my mind astray with foolish hopes , lots of them
it has been pointed out earlier that the homeric epic is the poetry of olympian culture , with which it sang its own song of victory over the terrors of the fight against the titans
as he thought about all this , sitting there among the suitors , he saw athena
just as black beans or peasfly off a broad shovel on large threshing floors , driven by the sharp wind or winnower 's strength—that 's how the arrow point glanced off the breast plate , then flew aside , away from glorious menelaus
his arms and legs she covered with an old man 's ancient flesh and dimmed his eyes , which had been so beautiful before
so they could eat meat to their heart 's content
back from athens—bad news for aegisthus
the noise never stops
brave diomedes , skilled at war cries , noticed this
shrewd telemachus then said in reply :
when i relied upon my youth and strength , i think i ranked among the very best
for he , too , i think , is dressed in rags like these ,
he will give you clothes himself , a cloak and tunic , and send you where your heart desires to go
your voyage here quite useless
that was just talk
if ares had come there , he would have approved of them , as would athena , who inspires men in war
in lovely thebes , ruling the cadmeans
daughter of great zeus and hera , goddess
resourceful odysseus answered him and said :
in order to get closer to these two instinctual drives , let us think of them next as the separate artistic worlds of dreams and of intoxication , physiological phenomena between which we can observe an opposition corresponding to the one between the apollonian and the dionysian
against her wishes , to give an order
the fair goddess calypso
given freely from her stores
but at least hector , priam 's son , wo not mount youor drive your finely decorated chariot
get up , old woman ,
to the high-roofed chamber which stored his father 's wealth , an extensive place
she stepped high up , onto the planking where the storage trunks were placed in which they kept their fragrant clothing
do not look in on anyone or ask questions
close to the gates , they met priam bringing home the body
and so through their depravity they have met an evil fate
in argos , but i sailed on to pylos
in earlier days , young men would take the dog to hunt wild goats , deer , and rabbits ,
ajax struck through the even circle of the shield of his opponent , but did not touch his flesh
left him and went to troy , you would quickly see
keep her distance and question her dear husband , or should she come up to him , hold his head and hands , and kiss them ?
but tell me truly how you chanced to see him
his words had wings
across from him stands idomeneus , surrounded by his cretans , like a god
as he sat there beside him , was the only one
alcinous , you should not concern yourself
with the lyre he was bringing pleasure to his heart , singing about the celebrated deeds of men
there was a radiance , as if from sun or moon
and the hearth of excellent odysseus ,
tell you something or keep it to myself ?
a large crowd stood around , enjoying the dancing magic , as in the middle two acrobats led on the dance , springing , and whirling , and tumbling
do not permit them to come into my presence
there has never been another period in the history of art in which so-called culture and true art have been so estranged and opposed as we may observe them to be at present
all the finest of phaeacians
he stabbed elephenor with his bronze spear , right in his exposed side , where his shield left himvulnerable as he bent down
counselor zeus has made manifest to us
son of atreus , you other argive leaders , many long-haired achaeans have been killed
there is one leader held back by the sea somewhere , but still alive
but come now , tell me—and make sure you speak the truth—
and now some men are setting out to kill
even now this metaphysical drive still tries to create for itself a certainly attenuated form of transfiguration , in the socratism of science that strives for life ; but on the lower steps , this same drive led only to a feverish search that gradually lost itself in a pandemonium of myths and superstitions that were collected from all over and piled up in confusion : nevertheless the greek sat among them with an unstilled heart until he learned to mask this fever with greek cheerfulness and greek frivolity , becoming a graeculus [ a contemptuous term for a greek
thanks to what the gods then willed , for we know everything that happens on this fertile earth
then heat a cauldron for him on the fire ,
about his straight-horned cattle and desires to wreck our ship and other gods agree ,
mother , i had to come down here to hades ' home ,
quite an impish boy—when we are outside
by father zeus , athena , and apollo , would i were as young as when the pylianand arcadian spearmen gathered to fightby the walls of pheia , beside the banksof the fast-flowing river celadon
or ask questions , or look directly at him
when he reached his comrades , he turned around and stood his ground once more
the son of cronos spoke , then nodded his dark brow
some god was planning trouble
and shoots an arrow through all twelve axes
lord of the dark cloud , ruler of all ,
once the surf had taken layers of sweat from off their skin and their hearts had been refreshed , they stepped in shining tubs and bathed
sweeter than honey the words flowed from his tongue
and we consider this problem too profound to be touched by such superficial styles of commentary
he 's in a bad way now
did not allow the raft to carry me ,
the spirit in my crew was shattered
their father present , all the gods at once stood up from their seats
some report of your dear father
that 's what he prayed
laodamas , what you have just said is really sensible
to my own land , when you had given me
telemachus , your heart will think of something , and power from heaven will provide the rest
do not whine to me , you dog , about my kneesor parents
did not forget his skillful tricks
the rage of zeus , the god of strangers ,
but my own work must not be wasted , worth nothing
saying this , ajax tried a lift
is prompting me to state
but i ca not see any argive who could do that
traced out by someone very skilled in carpentry
when she spewed it out , she seethed and bubbled
lord alcinous , most renowned of men ,
no one else was allowed to sit there with them , no old or younger men
you suitors , make sure your hearts do not encourage you
as for men on the estates , i would prefer
bearing all sorts of different types of grapes ,
you would not utter prophecies like these
he was sitting there
but not even horse-taming hyperenor , strong as he was , got much enjoymentfrom his youthful vigour , once he would mocked me , as he waited when i came against him , calling me the most unworthy warrioramong danaans
now , as for you ,
thinking of patroclus , he sighed repeatedly , then said :
the purple cloak covering his back , jumped up ,
bright-eyed goddess athena answered hera :
men threw these logs down in a line along the shore , where achilles planned a massive burial mound for patroclus and himself
diomedes pulled up right in the middle of the crowd
and how could we avoid
but then telemachus , leaning his head over
yesterday , my twentieth day afloat ,
to hyperesia , where he lived and prophesied
i do not like you or care about your rage
i will see—and in my heart confirm—if he will return , as he 's just done , or if life-giving earth , which keeps even strong men down , will hold him
friends , what our wise queen has just said to us , as we would expect , is not wide of the mark
in return , music imparts to the tragic myth an intense and convincing metaphysical significance that word an image without this singular help could never have attained
and i am good enough to sing before you ,
the clearest figure still always had a comet 's tail attached to it , which seemed to hint at the unknown , the inexplicable
it 's better to be frank
then she knew me
i will send you off with honour
but if our feelings were those of entirely dionysian beings , myth as a symbol would remain totally ineffective and unnoticed , and would never for a moment keep us from listening to the re-echo of the universalia ante rem [ the universals before the thing ]
just at sunset , they reached the celebrated grove , sacred to athena
i washed it clean
then lash boards against his back
wherever you run into foreigners
with me in overall command , telling men
while she was doing laundry , one of them
now , let 's go straight for him
will not be useless , even though i travel
i might have seen
here that dreadful witches ' potion of lust and cruelty was without power
my dear child , i am giving you this gift as a reminder
indeed , my son , you have made a valid point
these he will present to you , with them the one he seized from you , briseis , daughter of briseus
by contrast , the sound painting of the new dithyramb immediately strips such a vivid event of its mythic character
in the likeness of a man , noted where it fell
and she revealed no lack of noble sense ,
hanging on my sturdy thigh and striking him , slicing off his head and knocking it to earth ,
but since you have only learned to misbehave ,
the sacred gods , afraid , stopped tying up zeus
for i can claimi do not neglect my fighting prowess
we had our food and drink ,
and he will get great sorrow , if achaeans are wiped out
meanwhile , the other men had finished working
you would prefer to beg throughout the land ,
let diomedes take the first-place prize
some argive has got it in his flesh
at once she spoke up accusingly :
with these words , achilles set off towards the city , his heart full , charging on like a prize-winning horse pulling a chariot at full speed across the plain with little effort—that 's how fast achilles ran , sprinting with his legs and feet
were eager to get up and charge outside
hit a man—eurydamas—while telemachus
to leave the horse , and he kept reaching for his sword hilt and his spear of heavy bronze
then you can rouse yourselves and come with me ,
fair-cheeked helen , standing beside him with the garment in her hands , spoke to telemachus and said :
but aegis-bearing zeus , son of cronos , keeps showering me with grievous troubles
so i will go
where now has the myth-building spirit of music gone ?
loyal servants stood with her , one on either side
that he would experience hardships on his trip
he ate and drank voraciously—many days had passed since he would last tasted food
carry it back here
my girls , give the stranger food and drink
it never once let up
i was alone , for zeus had struck my ship
you could not tell whether sun and moon still shone , for in that fighta mist surrounded all the best men standing there
going off on the run , menelaus came up to ajax , then spoke out :
you are the first one i have approached , after going through so much grief
that 's the reasoni will never stop this grieving for your death
with wild and dangerous men restraining him ,
to become the king of fertile ithaca ,
then eurymachus , son of polybus , answered her :
it happened that a thesprotian ship
with his flesh shriveling around his bones
then mighty agamemnon sent out men and mules , from huts in every quarter , to gather wood
deïphobus was of two minds— should he step back and pick out a companion from stout-hearted trojans , or should he try to fight all on his own ?
i ca not see all that clearly , but the man seems to be of aetolian descent , an argive king , mighty diomedes , son of horse-taming tydeus
rouse yourself , son of peleus , most feared of men
of all danaans after the noble son
here 's a fearful honoured goddess in my home , the one who saved me when i was in pain , after my great fall , thanks to my mother , that shameless one , eager to conceal me , because i was a cripple
where are his family , his paternal lands ?
still , we are sorry for the troops , danaan spearmen dying , suffering dreadful fates
he did not stay to let himself get known
his words stirred the heart in aeneas ' chest
the spear point smashed through the helmet with its horsehair crest , driven on by the force of ajax 's mighty fists in that huge spear
the torch light emanates from his own head
then drive the lambs and kids out of their pens
gouneus brought twenty-two ships from cyphus
when sleep fell down across their eyelids , the suitors felt an urge not to stay sitting there for any length of time , but to get themselves some rest down in the city
that bow of his
he 's tall and handsome !
i notice many men are feasting here—
pelias and neleus , and they became
the man is no longer an artist
men rushed to arm themselves
there 's any way he could get here on foot
hector saw this from the lines
man , rising up into something titanic , is victorious over his own culture and compels the gods to unite with him , because in his self-controlled wisdom he holds their existence and the limits to their authority in his hand
has granted him the power to understand—
we two come from the gods , here to help you—me and pallas athena , and zeus approves
to pour down on the flaming sacrifice ,
but i will tell these things to thunder-loving zeus
other people will not recognize them
but zeus wants us to winfar more than the danaans , and you all suffercountless fears and wo not keep battling on
with a man who came from somewhere else ,
then the housekeeper invited him to step
to reach old age among his own possessions ,
the surging sea parted round the two of them
i will have to wander round the city by myself ,
with horses and a well-built chariot
he would be quick to blame an innocent man
then on noble hector 's corpse he carried out a monstrous act
first , with ambrosiashe washed from her lovely body all the stains , then rubbed her skin with fragrant oil , divinely sweet , made specially for her
she set off , going to divine odysseus ' home
fourth was polyxeinus , son of agasthenes , augeas ' son
to my mind , this last place is the onewhere long-haired achaeans stand most in need
moves back and forth in its uncertainty
and trusting their own might , at once began
next , achilles set out the prizes for the archers , things made of blackened iron—ten double axes and ten with single blades
as you instruct me
a friend 's persuasion is an excellent thing
to move in ithaca , not in the city
she traced it out and recognized it
he was wondering whether he should charge and kill him with his staff ,
i am a friend
i marched here as an ally , traveling far , for lycia is a long , long way from here , by the swirling river xanthus , where i leftmy dear wife , my infant son , much property , something poor men covet
daughter of aegis-bearing zeus , set a rock in place to block the entranceway
where menelaus and his ships then sailed
come now , let 's ask some prophet , priest , interpreter of dreams—for dreams , too , come from zeus—a man who might say why apollo is so angry , whether he faults our prayers and offerings , whether somehow he will welcome sacrificial smokefrom perfect lambs and goats , then rouse himself and release us from this plague
with forestays they soon set the mast down in its notch , then rowed the ship in to its mooring place
each man sent a herald out to fetch some gifts
polyphemus , what 's so bad with you that you keep shouting through the immortal night and wake us up ?
i shall speak only of the most illustrious opposition to the tragic world view : by that i mean research scholarship , optimistic to the core of its being , with its father socrates perched on the pinnacle
our sacrificial victims , while i unsheathed
the cyclops , in his frantic rage , devoured
used up his goods , and victimized his son
will soon be here
whether they are cruel , unjust , and savage ,
i would like to know that
how then among all these immortal gods
i have sent antilochus to our fast ships , to swift achilles
and we live far off in the surging sea ,
inside a hollow cave , a place nymphs used
i have got a mind that 's not made for a fool
and it will happen
but now they are fightingwell outside the city , by our hollow ships
then nestor , standing up before the argives , said :
made of eternal bronze and gleaming like a star , it stood out among the homes of the immortals
telemachus , once i have gone up to my room ,
you will have a bed
fearful night envelops wretched mortals
i always remember with such yearning
diomedes woke up quickly , then answered him—his words had wings :
after our flesh and blood ?
and weave a robe , wide and delicate fabric
odysseus left the harbour , taking the rough path into the woods and across the hills , to the place where athena told him he would meet the swineherd , who was , of all the servants lord odysseus had ,
he is close by
she sat there a long time in silence
at this moment , men are constantly in action by our ships , with no relief
and set it down before them , then lots of meat ,
they know that themselves , more so than anyone
to die than live and fail in the attempt
he came to see
wished to get back to their hollow ship
some arrogant young man would make a comment using words like these :
in some land far away
for fate ordainsthat he will escape , so the dardanian racewill not die out and leave no seed alive
but earthshaker poseidon is a stubborn god ,
the son of menoetius , godlike man , stoked the fire , a huge one
where aeolus lived , son of hippotas ,
and you ’ ve thrown us all into disaster
for when music seeks only to arouse our indulgence by compelling us to find external analogies between an event in life or nature and certain rhythmic figures and characteristic musical sounds , when our understanding is supposed to be satisfied with the recognition of these analogies , then we are dragged down into a mood in which a conception of the mythic is impossible
and rose-fingered early dawn
but the ox-hide backstay
aboard swift ships to be escorted back by sailors
fleeing his country and great-hearted neleus ,
lord zeus , grant i may be revenged on this man , who first committed crimes against me , lord alexander
to glorify or else debase a man
father zeus and you other blessed gods
as your own husband , who will execute
a bad or feeble man , if gods follow you
daughter of great-hearted alcinous
nurse , come and help me
raise that long spear of yours and throw it
throughout all greece and middle argos
and say i swim in tears because my mind
we went ashore and carried water back
she placed it facing paris
and not conceal a thing
at dawn , we shall consider whether to go back
agamemnon , king of men , replied :
but what may art itself expect form the operation of an art form whose beginnings lie entirely outside of the aesthetic province and which has stolen over from a half-moral sphere into the artistic domain , deceiving us only occasionally about its hybrid origin ?
in case the noise the suitors made disturbed the guest and made him hate the meal because he would had to share the company of overbearing men
the guts came with it
to guard the palace of great-hearted alcinous
will be my lot , now that i have been cursed ,
and the hearth of excellent odysseus ,
telamonian ajax still gripped the spear , but it was useless without its bronze spear head , which fell some distance off , clanging on the ground
she put in delicacies , as well , and poured some wine into a goat skin
as many lovely presents as befit
lying on the couch , all her limbs relaxed
tlepolemus ' long spear struck sarpedon in his left thigh
was even angrier than before
just as an industrious and honest woman holds her scales , a weight on one side , wool on the other , until they balance , so she can glean a pittance for her children , that 's how evenly the battle raged , until zeus gave glory above all other men to hector , son of priam , who was the first man to jump inside that wall of the achaeans
as menelaus said these words , he sprang forward , grabbing the horse hair crest on paris ' helmet , twisting him around
odysseus struck molion , godlike attendant to lord thymbraeus
eat now , stranger , what a servant offers ,
were sailing off to troy , i prophesied
from zacynthus twenty young achaeans ,
there was no way athena would allow the suitors , those arrogant men , to stop behaving badly ,
but now , far from their city , they fight here , right by our hollow ships
or offered such well-chosen sacrifice
but come now , let 's make
before we designate this other spectator by name , let 's linger here a moment to reconsider that characteristic duality and incommensurability at the heart of aeschylean tragedy ( something we described earlier )
leaving the bodies there , he charged into the line where soldiers ' ranks were most confused ,
in the shape of acamas , thracian leader , he yelled at priam 's royal sons :
surely you are not tiredfrom those fights where men win glory , exhausted after killing off the trojans , for whom you feel such deadly hatred ?
and to begin with ,
set it lengthwise on the deck of the curved ship ,
the axe makes his force stronger
many labourers were wheeling ploughs across it , moving back and forth
still , of all mortal men in ilion , hector was the favourite of the gods
without a care they waste our property
what his dear father said
bring a boar in here , the best there is , so i can butcher it
my lovely ram , why are you the last one in the flock
before he could succeed in stringing up the bow
he quickly came to troy and to the hellespont
in front of them , hector 's horses , swift of foot , came out to fight
he picked out twenty men , the best there were in the whole state , and set up an ambush
zeus told me to come here against my will
to get back to our swift ship by the shore ,
was it so you would experience sorrowamong unhappy men ?
but for us to make use of plato 's terminology , we would have to talk of the tragic figures of the greek stage in something like the following terms : the one truly real dionysus appears in a multiplicity of shapes , in the mask of a struggling hero and , as it were , bound up in the nets of the individual will
but we are not going back to our own lands ,
the young men , after tying up their clothes ,
for if we come to blows , then we will have trouble
the famous earthshaker , enraged , replied :
those known for their great bravery did not back off
when agamemnon , king of men , heard these words , he quickly sent the troops off to their balanced ships
you will be laughing at the troubles still in store
the two of you were busy with the ox meat
his mind was not too clever—
he could keep grim death at bay
or else some achaean man will grab your armand throw you from the wall—a dreadful death—in his anger that hector killed his brother , or his father , or his son
meriones , with quick strides , caught up with acamas , then hit him with his spearin his right shoulder , as he was climbing in his chariot
falling on her knees , she implored her dear brother , pleading hard for his golden-bridled horses :
will deny my will by force , if i wish
trojans , lycians , dardan spearmen , be men , my friends , call on your fighting strength
who is especially irked at wicked deeds
moving down from heaven , looking like a woman
it 's skill that lets a helmsman steer his course , guiding his swift ship straight on wine-dark seas
of all his sons
i will fetch you clothing , a cloak and tunic ,
the sea surged up to the achaean huts and ships , as the two sides met with a tremendous noise , louder than ocean surf booming on shore , driven there from the depths by the harsh north wind , louder , too , than roaring fire as it jumps to burn the trees in some mountain clearing , louder than the wind which howls through the highest branches of some oak tree , a wind which at its worst makes the most piercing noise— that 's how loud the shouting came from trojans and achaeans ,
so i could get the gifts he would promised me ,
up to wide heaven
as if he were divine , then send him off ,
in it a servant woman
he quickly bent his bow , taking aim at diomedes
apollo could not live without dionysus !
but as soon as the genius of music flew away from tragedy , tragedy is , in the strong sense of the term , dead
and placed it in his hands
in such a furious temper , so that he
but the spear did not break through
to take the bow in its bright case down from its peg
i will be grateful always
and if , among philosophers , anaxagoras , with his concept of mind , seems to be the first sober man among total drunkards , so euripides might have conceptualized his relationship to the other poets with a similar image
desperately eager to destroy this place , they pitched their forces round it in a siege
with shields and two-edged spears
at that point , trojans , like some fire or windstorm , marched behind hector , son of priam , in a mass , shouting and screaming with excitement , hoping to seize achaean ships and kill the best men there
that tale , whose fame had climbed to spacious heaven , about odysseus and achilles , son of peleus ,
who are your parents ?
snatched two of my men and gorged himself
and here we see that the entire conception of the poet is nothing other than that illuminated image which nature as healer holds up before us after a glimpse into the abyss
they are beautiful and made just recently , but covered up with drapes
they ran fast , for this was no contest over sacrificial beasts , the usual prizes for a race
every trojan woman would revile me afterwards
come now , phaeacian counselor and leader ,
as yours to keep , all the food and wine ,
but all the other ships ,
far out in front
if all the argives in iasian argos
warming it here and there in the firelight
what can the healing magic of apollo not accomplish when it can even create the illusion that the dionysian is really in the service of the apollinian and capable of enhancing its effects -- as if music were essentially the art of presenting an apollinian content ?
odysseus , how is it you have come back here ?
i was not speaking all that seriously
go through with it
right now i am filthy ,
saying this , he pulled his bronze spear from the river bank
the finest clay , the most expensive marble—man—is here worked and chiseled , and the cry of the eleusianian mysteries rings out to the chisel blows of the dionysian world artist : do you fall down , you millions ?
aeneas , anchises ' worthy son , led the dardanians
are you trading men , or wandering the sea
having objects thrown at me or being hit
mesthles and antiphus commanded the maeonians
the spear of pelian ash drove straight through the shield , which rattled from the blow
pre-eminent among the tribes of men
and odysseus fathered me , his only son ,
not thinking i would feel the cold without it ,
the old man , godlike priam , then said in response to hecuba :
and planning brave odysseus ' journey home
well , he may be killed anyway—some godmay strike him
carry out your work— this butchery—out there on the plain
old godlike priam then answered achilles :
from fallen leaves scattered on the ground
i slung my large bronze silver-studded sword
or else in the sea the fish
you will see the suitors killed , if that 's your wish ,
for when the lethal fate of his sad death will seize him , so no achaean woman
different women , any one of whom might be suitable for us to marry
but he keeps control
he had two sons—phegeusand idaios—both very skilled in all aspects of war
to spacious lacedaemon , to the home
as he was coming home , back from the fields ,
seeing their advance , menestheus , son of peteos , shuddered , for they were aiming at his part of the wall , bringing destruction with them
and told him he should send me on my way ,
let all keep a sharp lookout , to stop a group from entering our citywhile the army is elsewhere
at that point i forgot
and does her weaving in an upper room
in some foreign land , and careless women
to anyone i wish or to withhold it—
agamemnon sent talthybius to the hollow ships , instructing him to bring a sacrificial lamb
just as a man sets a layer of gold on silver ,
the two put on their armour , closed the shining door , and made their way to wise and crafty odysseus
let 's give him gifts of friendship , as is right
another need was driving us away
on top of silver , a craftsman who 's been taught
will have to trust your heart
and meet the suitors with the strength he had
who competed with the gods in archery
moving around everywhere , he began the killing
i will not marry her
i was the only one
and do not lag behind
he sat on the highest part of mount olympus , under golden clouds , confined by zeus ' will , along with the rest of the immortal gods , forbidden to participate in warfare
that 's how my mother is ,
and may he find troubles in his house
he will scratch his shoulders on many doorposts ,
be gracious and give me a noble fame ,
you would get good prices there
but at that time , thetis said nothing of the evil which had taken place , the death of his companion , his dearest friend by far
he swam on ahead , eager
with this voyage of his , has now achieved
achaeans felt keen sorrow that such a worthy man had fallen
for the true poet , metaphor is not a rhetorical trope , but a representative image which really hovers in front of him in the place of an idea
i suffered many troubles and allowed
teasing achaea 's sons because in her heart
when he comes back home
a marriage she detested , nor did she
she 's still living in her home , as before—
if your man kills me with his sharpened bronze , let him strip my armour , take it away , off to your hollow ships , but give my body back to my house , so trojans and their wives
i want the truth , so i know what happened—
and two ox-hide shields , for the two of us
leading on another filthy scoundrel
has freely given him these presents
odysseus and his men
leave that sort of boasting to the gods ,
it 's good to extend one 's hand to zeus , if he 's inclined to pity
in this house , when you allow a stranger
even so , let me not die ingloriouslywithout a fight , but in some great actionwhich those men yet to come will hear about
then antinous , eupeithes ' son , addressed them :
back when the achaeans ,
if now the entire crowd philosophized , administered their lands and goods with tremendous astuteness , and carried on their own legal matters , well then , he claimed , that was to his credit and the achievement of the wisdom which he had drummed into the people
that wise odysseus would return back home ,
what will happen to our agreements , the oaths we made ?
on his shoulder he looped his bronze , silver-studded sword , his huge strong shield
long-suffering lord odysseus heard what she advised
tyro conceived and then gave birth to sons ,
clytoneus was by far the finest runner ,
she came out at once , opened the bright doors ,
feeling that hollow trap
the first contingent was led by menesthius , with his flashing breastplate , son of spercheius , the river fed from heaven
but alcinous rested in an inner chamber in the high-roofed house—his lady wife lay there , as well ,
the fact that in general there can be a connection between a musical composition and a perceptible presentation rests on the point that , as stated , both are only very different expressions of same inner essence of the world
alcinous made her his wife and honoured her
but the servants girded up his clothes and led him up
i lay down on the deck , while our ships ,
her force broke the ox-hide strap , leaving menelaus clutching in his massive hands an empty helmet
there she met the suitors , those arrogant men , who were enjoying themselves
go to the room upstairs , and promise
he would boasted his singing would surpass the muses , daughters of aegis-bearing zeus , should they compete
the son of cronos has made our family
he was digging round a plant , all by himself ,
eumaeus covered him with a huge thick cloak ,
there they face an imminent destruction
far away from us , beside achaean ships , their swift dogs will eat you
the phantom passed through the thong which held the bolt and went into penelope 's room
though i was dying , i raised my arms to strike her with my sword , but that dog-faced bitch turned her back on me
they ripped away my clothes , cloak and tunic ,
but that fearful goddess with a human voice ,
but when antilochus stood by menelaus , aeneas , though a swift fighter , started to withdraw , seeing these two men standing their ground together
meanwhile , achaeans were moving to the walls , their shields held up against their shoulders
hephaestus then prepared a prodigious blaze
but in my heart i had no appetite
so i will return home now to phthia
there , before the gates , they sat down
as someone capable of picking up
on their trip across the water , minds fully bent on slaughtering telemachus
in his right hand , he gripped a stone , a large jagged rock , his fingers wrapped around it
as wise as you or more welcome—your words
i know you well
he quickly shut the lid and bound it with a knot , a tricky one which he would picked up from queenly circe
to make it hot , and spoke to all my men ,
to see when his hands would fight the shameless suitors
he snapped off a huge chunk of mountain rock
know that i am earthshaker poseidon
and told my loyal comrades to stay there
other long-haired achaeans drink their portion , the amount allotted to them , but your cupalways stands full of wine , as does mine , so you can drink any time your heart desires
every struggle of the spirit of music for pictorial and mythic revelation , which becomes increasingly intense from the beginning of the lyric right up to attic tragedy , suddenly breaks apart , right after developing in full luxuriant bloom , and , so to speak , disappears from the surface of hellenic art , although the dionysian world view born out of this struggle lives on in the mysteries and in its most amazing transformations and degeneration never stops attracting serious natures to it
beside the shore , glowing with charm and beauty
charged at me—their anger was so great ,
that 's what i was like
even in the language of the old tragedies there was a great deal he found offensive or , at least , enigmatic
everything they did and suffered , the work
but thoas could not stripthe armour off
that 's how they talked
placed ambrosia and nectar right beside her
why do we possess so much fine property , by the river xanthus , beside its banks , rich vineyards and wheat-bearing ploughland ?
i saw alcmene , amphitryon 's wife ,
from laments , as i look after my own work
you will see your friends and make that journey back to your own high-roofed home and native land
everything is interwoven in the cloth
so many harsh ordeals
cloud-gatherer zeus answered him and said :
have changed all that completely
he would brace his arms and feet ,
apollo did not disobey his father
although i often sit here in my house
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
but come , let 's get our two minds workingto rouse our spirits for this coming fight
are all mixed up
for above all mortal men , odysseus
all his companions , leaving only two
then i replied and said :
for a different man
what if it were the case that the greeks , right in the midst of their rich youth , had the desire for tragedy and were pessimists ? what if it was clearly lunacy , to use a saying from plato , which brought the greatest blessings throughout hellas ?
for i wo not go in there alone
let zeus himself , hera 's loud-thundering husband ,
raw meat for them rip to pieces
argives also moved swiftly from their well-decked ships
the old man , in a hurry , climbed in his chariot , then drove out through the gate and echoing courtyard
each soldier 's appetite was fully satisfied— all dined equally
he 's put some good—you have undergone much pain ,
with this mirror of beauty , the hellenic will fought against the talent for suffering and the wisdom of suffering which is bound up with artistic talent , and as a memorial of its victory homer , the naïve artist , stands before us
he said these words to ease her mood , while he himself was planning her son 's death
they set off for the centre of that noisy battle , with cebriones , noble polydamas , phalces , orthaeus , godlike polyphetes , palmys , ascanius , morus , son of hippotion , men who would come from fertile ascania the day before as reinforcements
i had seven brothers in my home
tying the twisted sheep 's gut down at either end—
urging them on , so no one , in his fear ,
or some place else , not until she marries
here in the house , exactly as i said
you wo not escape from him
without paying anything , i will call upon
where , my lord , i ask you to remember me
the gates were being demolished
he answered me at once :
who , when i was still a boy , put me in charge
then agamemnon prayed on their behalf :
or restrain their hands from acting badly
in hope you would pity me and send me off
for this reason the dithyramb is essentially different from every other choral song
but i will have no part of escorting him
you have no cause to grieve because you are dead
euripides is a pure artist neither in planning his work nor in carrying it out
or bringing back the rest of your companions
in delos once i saw something like this—
he would already brought men lots of trouble
who 's watching over and protecting you
diomedes charged off , joining at once those soldiers fighting in the front , his spirit on fire to battle trojans , seized by frenzy three times greater than before
my kingship , or has another man already
he covered his broad back with a spotted leopard skin , picked up his bronze helmet , set it on his head , then picked a spear up in his powerful fist
but he could not sway hector 's heart
of the fertile mainland reaching out to sea ?
will rule sea-girt ithaca
one by one , relaxed me with their soothing words :
by far of the achaeans , i came here
would have lamented him , the one who planned
and carrying a freight of shining iron
a solemn oath that you will make no more plans to injure me with some new mischief
peirous , who would thrown the rock , ran up and speared his gut
a man stooped with age , but infinitely wise
they shared no words—they had no common language , but mixtures of tongues , with men from many lands
would have tossed me up onshore , throwing me
with him were antenor 's two sons , archelochus and acamas , extremely skilled in every form of war
that 's how they talked
posing a threat to men from other lands ?
to carry out what he would proposed
then they drank wine to their heart 's content and left , each to his own home , to get some sleep
my brother , swift achilles is really harassing you , with his fast running around priam 's cityin this pursuit
may set some monstrous creature of the sea
not till i would touched all my master 's body
the prophet calchas , understanding all , told us apollo 's will
the gods were sitting in assembly , among them
who were allied with us
death , who destroys men 's hearts , flowed all around patroclus , as he slaughtered erymas , amphoterus , epaltes , tlepolemus , son of damastor , echius , pyris , ipheus , euippus , and polymelus , son of argeas—all these patroclus laid out , one by one , on the earth , which nourishes all men
the best known connection , however , is the close juxtaposition of both names in the oracular pronouncements of the delphic oracle , which indicated that socrates was the wisest of men and at the same time delivered the judgment that euripides captured second prize in the contest for wisdom
she stood above his head and spoke to him , saying :
happy to have avoided being destroyed ,
survived , for queen hera rescued him
with such an open heart
but as the months and seasons came and went ,
and fine hospitality—that 's the right
but you should have a bath ,
however , once we look away from the character of the hero as it surfaces and becomes perceptible ( a character which is basically nothing more than a light picture cast onto a dark wall , that is , an illusion through and through ) we penetrate further into the myth which projects itself in this bright reflection
many of his men , armed with their ash spears ,
armed in bronze , only two leading warriors were killed on their way home
so you must go and say that to your son
here is the house you asked me to point out
he was in great distress , but , caked with brine , he was a fearful sight to them ,
achilles had laid waste lyrnessus and thebe 's walls , overthrown the spearmen mynes and epistrophus , sons of lord euenus , son of king selepius because of her , achilles sat still grieving
he 's been king , they say ,
so , stranger , pay attention to what i say ,
then the famous crippled god came back to them—
then how he came to aeolus , who would taken him in
i do not thinka trojan who gets within my spear rangewill have reason to feel happy
when godlike alexander saw menelaus there , among the fighters at the front , his heart sank
nevertheless i can assert ( something of a paradox to all appearances ) on the basis of the secret foundation of our essence , whose manifestation we are , precisely the opposite evaluation of dreams
i will not conceal it from you
with a long speech
royal and mighty alcinous rose from his bed ,
that statement of socrates 's dream vision is the single indication of his thinking about something perhaps beyond the borders of his logical nature
all right , my child , i will tell you the truth
now , come along with me ,
you have five dear sons living in your home—
embraced laertes , kissed him , and then said :
so now , since i am not returning to my own dear land , and for patroclus was no saving lightor for my many other comrades , all those killed by godlike hector while i sathere by the ships , a useless burdenon the earth—and i am unmatched in warfareby any other achaean armed in bronze , although in council other men are better—so let wars disappear from gods and menand passionate anger , too , which inciteseven the prudent man to that sweet rage , sweeter than trickling honey in men 's throats , which builds up like smoke inside their chests , as agamemnon , king of men , just now , made me enraged
she reached up to odysseus ' chin and said :
should deny me this
my friends , be patient , give us all more time , until calchas ' prophecy comes true or not
i have the finest ships and young men , too ,
during the summer months and in fruitful autumn , he makes his bed
together in a group , eupeithes rose to speak
was menelaus not in achaean argos ,
better men with stronger hands than hishave already been destroyed and will be
some low-born achaean said something like :
hermes the guide , killer of argus , then replied :
after i would put on
he came , stood in their midst , and delivered his report
the lance of knowledge turns itself against the wise man
troubles have fallen in a double sense
and these are the horseswhich dolon told us of , the man we killed
and lord odysseus left with them
they all ate and drank to their full heart 's content
as i drew closer to our curving ship ,
the fact that tragedy begins with him , that out of him the dionysian wisdom of tragedy speaks , is a phenomenon as foreign to us here as the development of tragedy out of the chorus generally
who can endure much suffering
are empty of all grace
now the music has become a feeble copy of a phenomenon and , in the process , infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself
such a man also understandshow to urge his horses on , right at the start , using leather reins
every pain you have suffered on the fish-filled seas , every wrong that hostile men have done on land
there in the cave—we did not have the strength
and the goddess would set before them very soon
he said he would seen odysseus with cretans
always thinking gentle thoughts about his master
odysseus stripped away the clothing he would received from fair calypso
so then i pushed the stake deep in the ashes ,
the music of apollo was doric architecture expressed in sound , but only in intimate tones , characteristic of the cithara [ a traditional stringed instrument }
after odysseus spoke , the two men went away ,
his spirit swiftly left his limbs , and he was carried off by hateful darkness
with no one else
a garden vine , fully ripe
three comrades , the ones i trusted most in any enterprise
i pursued , going after them like some black whirlwind
but i have no reports
athena guided it straight to pandarus ' nose , directly by the eyes
because he begged you to ?
all those lords with power in the islands—
that was a foolish thought !
repeatedly , i urged you not to do it
may gods grant you success !
by huge extensive roots—just like that , these two men , trusting the power in their arms , held their position , as great asius approached
the gods brought him up just like a sapling ,
he will run into troubles with those people
he 's strong , powerful enough to throw this far
joy in his heart
for some time they soared
my heart has often felt a strong desire to take a woman there as my own wife , someone suitable for marriage , to enjoy the riches which old peleus has acquired
other trojans and their famous allies followed what excellent polydamas had said to them , but asius , son of hyrtacus , leader of men , did not want to leave his horses or their driver , the attendant charioteer
there were fallen leaves in piles around the place
athena , goddess with the gleaming eyes , replied :
wind-swift iris then answered achilles :
she left to bathe herself , put fresh clothing on her body , and went away ,
my crew had a quick meal beside the ships
we shook our tokens in a bronze helmet
automedon , swift ares ' equal , stripped the armour , boasting in triumph :
all right , old priam , things will be arrangedas you request
when he would gone about as far as mules plough in a single day—and in deep fields they outwork oxen pulling double-jointed ploughs— the two men ran after him
what fools we are to get incensed at zeusso stupidly !
if you kill me , a minstrel , for i sing
would show me a way home
of aegis-bearing zeus , then said to her :
with many others in my company ,
but when agamemnon saw soldiers holding back from hateful war , he would lash out at them in anger
in making lovely things , a noble heart ,
on a trip to sparta and sandy pylos , to learn about his father 's voyage home—
next he set up a mast
let 's throw these guests
once cyclops had stuffed his massive stomach
and killed the man
then , in the entrance to her cave , scylla
each and every day to get back home ,
and no matter what he says , his words will not be wasted
the sons of noble alcinous took the lovely gifts and set them down before their honoured mother
nor do i care for any prophecy
and then the gods
for odysseus , while i have been far away
no human being could climb up that rock
they all got up and went to the sea shore , then quickly dragged the black ship up onto dry ground , while eager attendants carried off their weapons
i have reached here only after wandering
when you run into him , you must move back , or you will end up in hades ' house , contraveningwhat destiny ordains
now , indeed , antilochus , i will give up my anger with you
do not let him hit you with his spear or slash youat close quarters with his sword
meanwhile , the trojans , shouting and scattering in panic , were jammed up in every pathway
achaeans wo not keep me back , not for long
for men to make a common pile againwould be most unfair
with his share of the loot they passed around
somewhere far from his native land and friends
he 's the fastest one there is
laertes , and he , too , was the father
as he thought of this in his mind and heart , helen came into the room , emerging from her fragrant high-roofed chamber
hurled things at him , but for a little while his firm heart kept enduring what we threw
yesterday , my armour on my shoulders ,
i claim worthy descent through tydeus , who lies in thebes hidden underground
they lashed them tight behind his back , as odysseus , laertes ' royal son , who had endured so much ,
then among them all telemachus spoke out
there 's no one like odysseus here who will guard our house from ruin
great-hearted agenor saw him drag the dead man
then they traced out the dimensions of a mound , using stones to mark its base around the pyre , and then piled earth on top
with a golden shuttle
they heard what priam said and readily agreed
and yet , in spite of this , her heart was never sorry for penelope ,
some property of mine
in my dear native land ,
she embraced the child on her sweet breast , smiling
but we will hold back ,
so he burned him in his finely decorated armourand raised a burial mound above the ashes
her lovely song when early spring arrives ,
high on her head
zeus sent me herea messenger , the mother who bore me , daughter of the old man of the sea
the many fine-fleeced sheep and then set sail
the two men then battled over cebriones , like two lions struggling on a mountain peak over a slaughtered deer , both ravenous , both filled with fighting fury— that 's how those two masters of the war shout fought , patroclus , menoetius ' son , and glorious hector , over cebriones , both keen to slash each other 's flesh with pitiless bronze
wise penelope then answered him and said :
in her voice and form she resembled mentor :
then shook white barley grain on top
around its outer edge , he fixed a triple rim , glittering in the light , attaching to it a silver carrying strap
then went into the polished tubs to have a bath
now lash these horses on until you reachour swift ships
dolon just stood there terrified , stammering , pale with fear— his teeth were chattering in his mouth
our animals , and not just one or two ,
tydeus ' son was trying to aim his gleaming spear point over the huge shield , to get ajax in the neck
he cut through the tendons behind both feet , from heel to ankle , threaded them with ox-hide thongs , and then tied these onto his chariot , leaving the head to drag behind
goes into exile , leaving his relatives
we put our faith in it as a firm defencefor ships and for ourselves
ormenus ' son , like an immortal god
ox-eyed queen hera trembled as she answered—her words had wings :
she set foot in her blazing chariot , grasping her huge , strong , heavy spear , with which she kills men , heroes who annoy her , goddess with a mighty father
well before the others
when they would put glittering bronze around their bodies , they opened up the doors and went outside
great-heated trojans , too , spoke words like these :
disputes they go through with their husbands
he fell down with a crash
or the family he claims to come from
at once , took their places on the rowing bench ,
inside this house , your wife and child , a man
with his master 's goods while he was far away
then i carved out my bed , till i was done
sarpedon 's spear hit tlepolemus right in the neck
geranian horseman nestor answered diomedes :
when someone mentions my good master
agamemnon stood over him , then hacked off his head , so it fell on iphidamas
it was thrown by peirous , son of imbrasus , captain of the thracians , who would come from aenus
but when the sun went down and darkness came ,
the cruel rock crushed both tendonsand the bone
when brave eurylochus ’ lot fell out ,
if you are my son and truly of our blood ,
well , eumaeus , i hope the gods pay back the injuries
before the year goes by , you will be giving birth to marvelous children , for a god 's embrace does not lack power
through her tears she spoke—
the other deities , those ranked below him , listened carefully
but i clung to the keel of my curved ship
a sure sign , so you will clearly know it 's me
above the blood , and , on the other side ,
he especially found too much pomp and circumstance for simple relationships , too many figures of speech and monstrosities for the straightforward characters
then let our singer end his song , so all of us ,
constant grief lay on his heart for his own son , antinous , the first man killed by lord odysseus
meanwhile odysseus eagerly devoured the meat
then amphinomus , splendid son of nisus ,
eurycleia went back through odysseus ' splendid home to tell a cable attached to the top of the round house and to a nearby pillar
we do not need more talk
here the will in in the highest danger
well , this is bad news—
he did not move the sceptre to and fro , but gripped it tightly , like some ignoramus—a bumpkin or someone idiotic
son of peleus , do not be so afraid
but her nights and days all end in sorrow , with her shedding tears
apollo raced on , only a little bit ahead , using his cunning
we captured thebes , city of seven gates , leading smaller forces over stronger walls , trusting signs sent by the gods and zeus ' aid
with your forceful words to drive this stranger
when , at this point , he sees to his horror how logic turns around on itself and finally bites its own tail , then a new form of knowledge breaks through , the acknowledgement of the tragic , which in order merely to be endured , requires art as a protector and healer
thick with whispering trees , mount neriton ,
come , i will tell you the trees you gave me once
my heart rejoiced—i thought it was no dream ,
the splendid queen , so i may speak to you
cloud-gatherer zeus then answered her and said :
do they have any more regard for you ?
then odysseus went to sit some distance off ,
not one of them will send us from their town
then the cattle herder answered him :
they are suitors for my mother—their pride
cloud-gatherer zeus then answered her and said :
but i stayed at that place a while , in case
however , to prevent this apollonian tendency from freezing form into egyptian stiffness and frigidity and to prevent the movement of the entire ocean from dying away , through the attempts of the apollonian tendency to prescribe to the individual waves their path and extent , from time to time the high flood of the dionysian destroys those small circles in which the one-sided apollonian will seeks to confine the greek spirit
patroclus , why predict my own death for me ?
pallas athena roamed throughout the city ,
and made a prophecy
hector , do not talk to me of our agreements
as for the others ,
and the sturdy courtyard wall and kill them
to various places , to sandy pylos
odysseus and i have not seen each other
to menace human beings
now the dithyrambic chorus takes on the task of stimulating the mood of the listeners right up to the dionysian level , so that when the tragic hero appeared on the stage , they did not see something like an awkward masked person but a visionary shape born , as it were , out of their own enchantment
the flames went out
then , after they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart 's content , each of them returned back home to get some rest
where achaeans suffered such distress ,
you would met your fatal end in trojan lands ,
bronze and gold lay there stacks , with clothing packed in chests and stores of fragrant oil
the skin on all of them changed colour
the two ajaxes moved back and forth along the wall , urging men on , firing up the fighting spirit in achaeans
and send him off in a chariot with your son
away from my companions , who would gone out ,
well , do as you wish , but we other godswill not all approve your actions
or did you meet some god who gave them to you ?
so we can set out pieces of the thigh
for this fact to be acknowledged , before it was established that all art inherently depended on the greeks , from homer right up to socrates , we had to deal with these greeks as the athenians dealt with socrates
to eat my wheat
at least that is my experience
as eupeithes said this , he wept , and all achaeans were seized by pity
he will get angry and stand up to proclaim
look there , child of aegis-bearing zeus , you tireless one , that dog fly once againis leading man-killing ares through the crowd , away from battle
to where her father lives , for he 's a man
prudent telemachus then answered him and said :
and no longer thinks about her children
that said , he spoke to antinous—his words had wings :
then he will add to this seven women of lesbos , skilled in crafts , whom he chose for himself when you captured well-built lesbos
slaughtering oxen , fat goats , and sheep
that would be entirely unfair to me
and thus the apollinian illusion reveals itself as what it really is -- the veiling during the performance of the tragedy of the real dionysian effect ; but the latter is so powerful that it ends by forcing the apollinian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to speak with dionysian wisdom and even denies itself and its apollinian visibility
the work for which we came remains undone
idomeneus did not relent his fighting frenzy
after evading death and fate , he shows up
something to wear whenever a great storm blew
looking like one of wise alcinous ' heralds
you would marry my child and become my son ,
i am prepared to swear the oath , as my heart bids , and , before the gods , i will not swear falsely
to milk each ewe and bleating goat ,
he raised a resounding yell , crying to his trojans :
apollo comes there with his silver bow
but when aegis-bearing zeus aroused him ,
the two men , godlike odysseus ' servants , then went in as well
deep in my heart
from the back cut of a white-tusked boar , lots of fat on either side , and called out to the herald :
and one receives more honours for oneself
in your own home you have changed my crew to pigs and keep me here
his unsheathed bow in hand , with an arrow
has given birth to such a noble son
one claimed he would paid in full , setting out his case before the people , but the other was refusing any compensation
may antinous come to a fatal end ,
then achilles , loved by zeus , moved into action
a sweet sleep binding me , shrouding my eyes ?
the miraculous mist dissolved away from him
hector , which of the achaeans will now fear you , since you are afraid of menelaus , who so far has been a feeble spearman ?
it 's made of gold—for all his days to come
because he would joined with taphian pirates
odysseus , as wise as zeus , led these troops , who came with him in twelve black ships
he clearly told you to assist the trojans , to defend them until evening comes , casting its shadows on the fertile farm land
may zeus destroy them before they harm us
remaining there until the light of dawn
now everything my dear heart once desired
as you have just said ?
those present listened carefully , then followed his advice
father zeus , will any mortal manon boundless earth , after this event , inform gods of his plans , of his intentions ?
geranian horseman nestor answered odysseus :
which will go as far , i think , even further
shrewd odysseus , still smiling , then continued :
he found cadmeans feasting in large numbers in the palace , home of great eteocles
his speed and strength , and then you would be amazed
that flow on earth
her father and her brothers are already telling her to marry
was far too little
now in that dream
odysseus moved throughout the army , calming things
day and night-time trails lie close together
as they moved on together
to kill a man , even as companions
i would prefer you keep those gifts yourself—
she summons to these halls
then he hit him , his sword slashing through his neck—his limbs collapsed , and iphidamas fell there into a bronze sleep , unhappy man , far from the wife he would married , to help his fellow citizens , far from that lady from whom he would had no favours , though for bride price
the ships were smashed to pieces by the waves
camped by the banks of the sangarius river
i went to where my ships were on the beach—
the assembly is the place for speeches
the greek were already fully on their way to labeling cleverly and arbitrarily the completely mythical dreams of their youth as historical , pragmatic , and youthful history
have snatched him off and left no trace
and you are attempting to confuse my mind
and reach your native land
if she knows that everything you say
have pulled from the gray sea up on the curving beach , lying piled up on the sand , longing for sea waves , while the bright sun takes away their life—that 's how the suitors then were lying in heaps on one another
but he sits there , all by himself , without a care , without a worry , claiming he 's supremeamong immortal gods , manifestly so , for strength and power
now , near the country of the cyclopes ,
across the fish-filled seas
all women an evil reputation ,
for now things stand upon a razor 's edge—miserable destruction for achaeansor their salvation
he spoke , then kissed his son
i left it open—
some racing drivers , trusting their chariot and horses , drive themcarelessly , moving back and forth , weaving on the course
and from ithaca itself twelve young men ,
and dishonouring the wife of a man who ,
right now he 's testing all the army
then aeneas killed two of the best danaans , crethon and orsilochus , whose father livedin well-built phere , a man of property , descended from the river alpheus , whose broad streamsflow through pylian land
so he challengedcadmean young men and beat them easily
put me and war-loving menelausin their midst to fight it out for helen , all her property
shrewd telemachus then answered nestor , saying :
take me alive , son of atreus—you will getgood ransom
possessions and a house built near my own
with strength like that , i could have stood with you
astonishingly so—to tell the truth ,
around the city , put up homes , raise temples
indeed , what is the dionysian ?
the sort you would not hope to come across
when i would had my fill of rolling in the sand
she took my hand and led me from the house
when the old man ,
now you must plunge
but so far hector 's wife knew nothing of all this , for no messenger had come to tell her clearly that her husband had remained outside the gates
having said these words , glorious hector took his plumed helmet in his hands
that lion-hearted man , whose qualities
here we have before our very eyes in the highest symbolism of art that apollonian world of beauty and its foundation , the frightening wisdom of silenus , and we understand , through intuition , the reciprocal necessity for both of them
achilles , you may be stronger , since your mother was divine , but he 's more powerful , for he rules more men
men stood outside them , trying to knock them down by force to pass on through
a brave and wealthy man
—he will hand overand add more goods from his own home
we landed at geraestus , where we offered
to be more active , put courage in his heart ,
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
the hero , the highest manifestation of the will , is destroyed , and we are happy at that , because , after all , he is only an illusion , and the eternal life of the will is not disturbed by his destruction
choose fifty-two young men who in the past
however , alongside this condition , the singer simultaneously , through a glimpse at the surrounding nature , becomes aware of himself as a subject of the pure , will-less knowledge , whose imperturbable , blessed tranquilly now enters to contrast the pressure of his always dull , always still limited willing
what men 's countries have you visited ?
that 's what someone would have said—he would never know what was going on
i will bring him on board
and the son born from the two of us
men ca not reject fine presents from the gods , those gifts they personally bestow on us , though no man would take them of his own free will
for some time she could not speak a word to him—
saying this , agamemnon held up his sceptre , invoking all the gods
in her chest the heart is quite divided ,
a cloak and tunic , and then send me off
on land or killed at sea by waves stirred up
looking down on the two men , the son of crooked-minded cronos pitied them
men from zeleia , on mount ida 's lowest slope , wealthy trojans , men who drink dark waters of the river aesepus were led by pandarus , lycaon 's worthy son , whom apollo had taught archery
they look like living servant girls , possessing minds , hearts with intelligence , vocal chords , and strength
live far away , for no one dwells near us ,
that old man shows under those rags of his
had firmly charged to watch out for his wife ,
at his words , the old man grew afraid
so you can carry the bright coverlets ,
on their way , they reached the river asopus , its lush grassy meadows full of reeds
up to the city , seeking idomeneus ,
i will not hold back , but go straight at their lines
in this shameful way
it wants to be exactly the opposite , the unadorned expression of the truth , and it must therefore cast off the false costume of that truth thought up by the man of culture
in an insulting , overbearing way ,
hera quickly lashed the horses with her whip
so they would set the ships in rows , and thus filled up the whole wide coastal bay between the headlands
but going back demoralized is bad
although her heart is sad , she feeds their hopes , by giving each man words of reassurance
when you see that ,
he did not repay his parents for the work they would done to rear him— he did not live long enough , slaughtered on the spear of great-hearted ajax
when he thought of going to bed to get some sleep , she told the women slaves
so let all this
she told me first of all
the herald , pontonous , then brought up a silver-studded chair for him
his bowels spilled out onto the ground
she did not reply—her words could find no wings
i wish pure artemis would quickly bring
the chief mourners stayed behind
but you do not seem to be a man like that
the old chariot fighter , produced the gold
he 's killed your trusty comrade podes , eëtion 's son , a noble front-line warrior
back from sandy pylos or from sparta
a man who visits as a wanderer
on the other side , ajax called out to his companions :
along each rowing bench
but he 's damagedargives in a major way , with actionsthey will remember for many years to come
optimistic dialectic , with its syllogistic whip , drove music out of tragedy , that is , it destroyed the essence of tragedy , which can be interpreted only as a manifestation and imaginary presentation of dionysian states , as a perceptible symbolizing of music , as the dream world of a dionysian intoxication
his work proceeded quickly
told the worthy swineherd to stand beside this door and watch , for there was just one way of reaching it
i thinkmany of them will be glad to get some rest , the ones who escape this deadly warand who evade my spear
when i would said this , circe went through the hall , her wand clutched in her hand , and opened up
his heart did not suspect there was a trick
but first let 's ask the gods
he surpassed all men of his own time in knowledge about birds and making prophecies
his mind works quickly , but his judgment 's suspect
after saying this , he handed the girl over
so now let 's thinkhow we may make amends , win him back with giftsand gracious speeches , and be friends once more
they flew off willingly , mid-way between the starry heaven and earth
once he gets here , he lies down to rest
that man was mulius , a spear fighter , son-in-law to augeias
whenever i move up to starry heaven
young and old , one of whom could well be king ,
at this , ares gave her his golden-bridled horses
at this lycaon 's noble son gave out a noisy shout :
and he will always eat his meals with us
as for your father , he stays on his farm
and then hung loops of it from roof beams high above , fine as spiders ' webs , impossible to see ,
in her hand she gripped a spear
odysseus recognized the river as it flowed
if , among human beings , you know of some
remember what i have said
whether it was that child of zeus , the muse ,
who lives here as my friend and treats me well
and in return i will sacrifice to you
so i will agree to your request
so let the black earthopen here for each of us
into the fields—such things warm servants ' hearts
i would have a curved scythe in my hands , and you
in their rooms , so i can put away in storage
the servers placed beside odysseus a portion
before that day , there are still many more
from god-nurtured kings who wield a sceptre
welcomed both of them and said :
in this sense the dialogue is an image of the greeks , whose nature reveals itself in dancing , because in dancing the greatest power is only latent , betraying its presence in the lithe and rich movement
his next of kin thus divided up his assets
with these words , hector of the shining helmet left that furious conflict and strode quickly off with rapid strides , following his companions , the men taking the famous armour of achilles towards the city
then , horseman patroclus , you made fun of him :
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
all the things that went on there in troy , all trojan and achaean suffering ,
they raced on like this about as far as a discus flies when tossed with a shoulder swing by a powerful young man testing his strength
brought on my fatal end
for the truth is this—of all the things which breathe or move on earth , nothing is more miserable than man
to be overly surprised your father
to a place between the round house and fine wall around the courtyard , herding them into a narrow space
i got to know them—from their appearance and their wise advice
but i do not think it 's all just as you said ,
other assets you could obtain elsewhere ,
it 's near the road , a clump of poplar trees
son of telamon , still full of anger
so i could tell him how , when i left here ,
for the titaressus is a branch of the river styx , dread waters by which the most solemn oaths are sealed
helper hermes accompanied them as well , the godwith the most cunning mind of all
once they would had food and drink to their heart 's content , telemachus and the noble son of nestor
so they fought on , like blazing fire
so he may go as quickly as he can ,
fleeces , cloaks , and shining coverlets
so the sun set
finally in prison he came to understand how , in order to relieve his conscience completely , to practice that music which he had considered insignificant
call each soldier by his father 's name , complimenting all of them
but there was nothing he could do to pull back now , retreat into the ranks
and in plain sight of all ?
made all our plans so hard to carry out
oh , make that happen
with an understanding heart
you look like a king
odysseus prayed , and pallas athena heard him
i saw phaedra , procis , and fair ariadne ,
thanks to my slaves , those ungrateful bitches
gentle sleep had overpowered nestor 's son ,
that old warrior , who , men say , no longer comes
the finest goats by far from all the herds ,
my son , from what you have just been saying , you are fated to an early death , for your doomcomes quickly as soon as hector dies
they cooked these on split wood , then placed the innards on spits in hephaestus ' fire
but your mind is empty
in his hand he held up on a golden staff the scarf sacred to archer god apollo
my fond exhausted heart slept through the night , past daybreak and noon—not until the sun
odysseus rose from his soft bed and told his wife :
to some other place ?
though each of you shares in this honour , too
the kind of wine we had on board our ship , a gift of drink i was carrying for you ,
for one more year , although it 's hard for me
geranian horseman nestor then said to patroclus :
do not try to comfort me about my death ,
gracious hebe went among them , pouring nectar
here you will meet your doom , though as a fighter , you are so formidable and brave
first , she led the sure-footed horses against ares
a man raised by zeus , shimmered in the light ,
for i say this—no achaean will beat me with his fistsand take this mule
i wish i would died and met my fate right there ,
once there , he can beg food from anyone
beside the fire where she used to sit , they placed a chair for her , inlaid with ivory and silver
there is a very ancient folk belief , especially in persia , that a wise magus could be born only out of incest
if these two had died , then we would have somethingreal to grieve about
the son of atreus , famous spearman menelaus , struck him , as he stood up in his chariot , hitting him right on his collar bone
but these suitors here , i think , know something—
by you and by my honourable mother ,
then the phaeacian counselors and leaders ,
the race of men who walk upon the groundcan never match the race of deathless gods
i would publicize your fame
i just do not know
as a man can shout , moving forward quickly ,
and cry out in distress
well , i claim i am great anchises ' son , and aphrodite is my mother
i do not think we will bring this talkto a successful end , not on this trip
resourceful odysseus then replied to him and said :
then she promised she would offer perfect sacrifice
menelaus , son of atreus , stood there over him , holding his long-shadowed spear
leocritus , son of evenor—he struck him
the lovely goddess then replied :
the bronze point smashed straight through the frontal bone
adrestus fell onto his back
and for us there is no consolation ,
swift-footed achilles then said to priam :
like the balm well-crowned cytherea rubs on herself when she goes to the joyful dancing of the graces
he stirred up winds
the deathless god appeared before odysseus
you poor wretch , you are not considering your own death at all—it 's getting closer
resourceful odysseus then answered her and said :
off now to your sty , and lie in there
no woman in your household
before it could , it snapped off at the socket
resourceful odysseus , laertes ' son ,
the dead were making noises , like birds
phoebus , why do we two stand aloof ?
he has my blessing !
about a friend of mine , if he 's still alive
my misguided king , do you think achaea 's sons are really fearful cowards , as you state ?
as he did so , lord odysseus shot an arrow
be careful , son of dardanus
i do not know if he 's going to scout our shipsor strip some dead man 's corpse
that 's why i will never issue such an order
then you would find out how strong i am and what my hands can do
the speeches of teiresias of thebes ,
their frequent reckless conduct in your home ,
even though he 's dead , persephone
then you would not have seen lord agamemnon sleeping , hiding , or not keen to fight
he grabbed telemachus ' hand and said to him :
how blind he was , poor fool !
i was so tired , sweet sleep fell over me
i will leave my house ,
should not my longing overleap the distance
she crossed the wooden threshold—a long time ago a skillful craftsman planed it , set it straight and true , then fitted doorposts and set shining doors in place
and hope i will find a sloping beach somewhere
swift iris , with feet like the wind , replied :
i want to fight
to get back again
they quickly got the suitors to give up their games and had them sit down all together in a group
the others ' horses may be faster runners , but the drivers are no better skilled than you
angry with her , he went down into that huge crowd of trojans and woke up hippoco ön , a thracian counselor , one of noble rhesus ' family
people themselves learned from euripides how to speak
but when a man laments all day , his heart
water poured upon our hands , then once again
and in my heart , priam , i recognize—it 's no secret to me—that some godled you here to the swift achaean ships
an arrow struck eurypylus in the thigh
a high dark wave rose arching over them ,
for jason was her friend
it drove on through two layers , but there were still three more , for crippled god hephaestus had hammered out five layers , two made of bronze , two inner ones of tin , with a gold one in between
but he did not repay his fond parents for raising him
a family which , in days to come , will have a famous name , since penelope
and who , on the other hand , would think of making only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those florentine circles and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the love of the opera which spread with such rapidity ?
a fine and worthy man dear to your heart ?
i do not think you will come back unsuccessfulin getting what it is your heart desires
who did not get back home
today i found no one else strong enough for that
i will sound out my father ,
dryops fell at achilles ' feet
you know all things ?
his head rolled in the dust as he was speaking
son of atreus , meet his death ?
that 's what i said
but never thought to see it !
so come , then , shoot an arrow at him—at splendid menelaus
then he left the hut , going to lie down and rest where the white-tusked boars slept beneath a hollow rock , sheltered from north wind
the bronze breastplate he was wearing did not help him— the spear lodged in his gut
stopped barking and fawned around him
will touch my feet , none of the serving women
now , there was a certain mancalled euchenor , son of polyidus the prophet , a rich , brave man , who lived at home in corinth
men from nisyrus , crapathus , casus , cos , eurypylus ' city , the calydnian islands had pheidippus and antiphus , sons of lord thessalus , hercules ' son , as leaders
sent you out here ?
so you can understand there is no joy for me in being king
or i may bring gods ' anger down on you
telemachus moved up to where his room was built ,
to set their hands to the ship 's rigging
dressed in a filthy , shabby , patched-up tunic
any other women of the household
for my part , i advise us to returninto the city—we should not stay here , on the plain , waiting for dawn beside the ships
ask penelope to come here with her slaves ,
he set out goblets made of gold , as a herald went back and forth pouring their wine
their monstrous acts of wanton foolishness ,
you are the one who longs to get back home , once evening comes , before the others
a dark wave swallowed her
now here you are again , asking meto do something i simply must not do
the watchman went straight to the palace to report the news
he groaned aloud and struck his thighs with both his palms , then expressed his grief , saying :
the swiftest of all flying things , could match her speed , as she raced ahead , slicing through the ocean waves , carrying a man whose mind was like a god 's
at dawn bright-eyed achaeanswill organize for battle round the city
as well as ten gold talents
i might try the bow myself
six daughters as well as six full-grown sons
those bristles brought on by that nasty drug
are coming home with empty hands
they put dry kindling round them , hard seasoned wood , freshly split by axe
you make me call to mind the suffering
lord odysseus cried out in triumph :
we will hold off the trojans and godlike hector , standing behind you with a single heart , just as we share one name
at troy , if he would come safely back , bringing
while i look on in pain
in our assembly you are all infants , silly children , with no sense of war 's events
i had inside my home , providing him
here in my home , i will give you the finest ,
you two need not continue wrestling
when leiodes had finished ,
could you yourself produce a strategy
as i travel on my journey homeward ?
i can not talk of him in any detail
and come here to my farm
he will drive achaeans back a second time , once he 's turned them into cowards
but now achillesprays that north wind and loud west wind will come
arching high above his head , and drove it at him
here wise penelope sat , while white-armed servants came from the women 's hall and started to remove the lavish amounts of food , the tables , and the cups high-spirited suitors had been drinking from
he spoke winged words of sympathy :
that odysseus had come
for both sides a major fight ensued
he stirred up a second nasty quarrel
he stayed there , but my father roamed around
just like that , the din rose upthroughout the widespread trojan force
underneath them divine earth made fresh flowers grow— dew-covered clover , crocuses , and hyacinths , lush and soft , to hold the lovers off the ground
if you were to spend five or six years here
then , after quickly cutting down brush wood ,
with respect to the astonishing daring with which aeschylus places the olympian world on his scales of justice , we must remind ourselves that the deep-thinking greek had an unshakably firm basis for metaphysical thinking in his mystery cults , and that he could unload all his skeptical moods onto the olympians
with a cry , she threw herself on him , hands tearing at her breast , her tender neck , her lovely face , fair as a goddess , lamenting :
or at least his image , for he himself
or else kill the men , while i take care of them
besides , he 's healthy , and he is no fool
encased in shriveled skin
they have all taken refuge , like dogs around a lion
until we move into the city and reach
would treat me badly , and some deity
these men stood in line , as achilles pointed out the turning post— the race course was the distance there and back
you go at me like this , with such anger
i will stay and stand up to their attack
he set me in his chariot ,
do all this , you great-hearted trojans , just as i have said
he left me there ,
then he slaughtered pylon , as well as ormenus
so zeus did not want patroclus to become merely a plaything for the dogs of his trojan enemies
he would not escape his grim fate and come back from the ships to windy troy , proudly boasting of his chariot and horses
shrewd telemachus then said to menelaus in reply :
he was called arnaeus—his honoured mother
three times he thought it through in his mind and heart , and three times counselor zeus
then two long spears flew from their hands together
tie it round your breasts
after saying this , apollo took a seat high up on pergamus
under the incessantly changing phenomena the eternal primordial mother , always forcing things into existence , always satisfied with the changing nature of appearances !
in just that way , fair-haired menelaus stood above patroclus
with their own eyes all say the same—we both
you fool , do not offer me a ransom or some plea
and freezing wind , his dear son had met me ,
the chosen man will greatly benefitwell-armed achaeans and his own heart , too—if he comes away from this grim fight , this dangerous combat
gripping the scales , he raised them by the centre
sophocles was the third person named in this hierarchy , the man who could praise himself in comparison with aeschylus by saying that he ( sophocles ) did what was right because he knew what was right
with my sharp bronze , i was to wound her
was in decline did that sweet sleep release me
to come in here—they can stand beside me
with curving boats drawn up along the road ,
a splendid chest , which she filled with precious gifts , the clothing and the gold brought by phaeacians
eumaeus , some comrade of yours is coming ,
instead , waves from the sea and deadly blasts of fire carry away
so why mislead me with such questioning ?
your mother first got the report
so standing above priam 's head , he said to him :
long-suffering lord odysseus was pleased and spoke out in prayer , saying :
daughter of great-hearted arsinous , she would been chosen for him by achaeans , because he excelled them all in giving wise advice
he 's gone where people can not see or hear him ,
a long way by his father and other senior men ,
so long as the single creator of order and ruler of all , the mind , was still excluded from artistic creativity , everything was still mixed up in a chaotic primordial pudding
renowned odysseus , your store of tricks , of suffering , is infinite
that 's what he said
i do not blame you in the least , for anyone
once he would heard the unwelcome news , hephaestus went into his forge , pondering some nasty scheme deep in his heart
then the crowd of women came ,
he hit lord antinous and went on shooting ,
that heart in your chest always thinks this way
are like their fathers
dark blood at once came flowing from the wound
the appearance of a swallow
nothing can be more offensive to our stage techniques than the prologue in euripides 's plays
she incited the two sons of atreus
far and wide through greece and central argos
but he never finished what he had to say
i have suffered and struggled through so much ,
she gave telemachus the fine two-handled cup
strangers being abused and female servants
and so for three years
the spectator without a play is a contradictory idea
her dreadful grieving and her sorry tears
bringing water in a basin etched with flowers
and trust me in your hearts—here 's the old scar
with misery and painful wretchedness
for that reason the book should at this point be handled with some consideration and discretion
teucer , my friend , mastor 's son , our worthy comrade , has been killed
my child , why have you left hard battle to come here ?
or until she misses me or learns i have gone ,
meriones stooped down and scooped them from the plainwith his own hands , then spoke to idomeneus :
but the old man
brought on your death
but once the waves have smashed my raft apart ,
the shadowy mountains of your country
agamemnon 's sharewas fair-skinned chryseis
he pulled on his shining bronze
a weak man , too , in future days , or else
in ithaca he never did or said
he 's wiped outso many achaean men , good ones , too , and so rashly
for counselor zeuswo not let me fight these trojans all day long
and so one may verify ( in an eccentric way ) what schopenhauer says of the man trapped in the veil of maja : as on the stormy sea which extends without limit on all sides , howling mountainous waves rise up and sink and a sailor sits in a row boat , trusting the weak craft , so , in the midst of a world of torments , the solitary man sits peacefully , supported by and trusting in the principium individuationis [ the principle of individuality ] ( world as will and idea , vol
today i would state that it was the problem of scholarship itself , scholarly research for the first time grasped as problematic , as dubious
odysseus , you no longer have that firm spirit and force you once possessed
this , you must know , is the arching cavern
he told him to do it
then great telamonian ajax moved out front , and strong diomedes , son of tydeus , got up
i am sure that for countless men precisely this , and only this , is the effect of tragedy , but it plainly follows that all these men , together with their interpreting aestheticians , have had no experience of tragedy as a supreme art
will not bring you distress and suffering—
so now , let that be ,
all the property which paris brought herein his hollow ships to troy—how i wish he would died before that day !
i am no weakling
giving his armour to his noble comrade laodocus , who drove the horses close beside him , he set off on the run
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
now , though menelaus was still very keen
may that man come , and led on by some god
in that trojan land , when achaeans shot ,
we have each got only one
dawn will soon be here
and came at once to tell hephaestus
first on his legs he set his shin guards—beautifully made , fitted with silver ankle clasps
from somewhere far away , if you must ask
of wise penelope , icarius ' daughter ,
bronze and gold and piles of woven clothing ,
she 's brought here some shipwrecked vagrant , a man whose people
he would seized it as a prizewhen he would destroyed the city of eëtion
that how some god has spun a fate for him
which made him stand out among danaans
she bathed herself and took fresh clothing for her body
feeding on the plant , eager to forget
with these words , achilles stirred the spirit in each man
so ox-eyed queen hera then began considering how she might deceive the mind of aegis-bearing zeus
of brave telemachus and bring back
and reaches full maturity
answer what i am asking
where men speak a foreign tongue , if , in fact ,
he was turning it this way and that , testing it
around thymbreare positioned lycians , mysians , impetuous fighters , and phrygians , who fight on horseback , and from maeoniathere are charioteers
would have appeared with them still weeping there , if goddess athena with the gleaming eyes ,
keeping watch on them , while i sent out scouts
for you are king of an extensive plain
eumaeus looked at the man , scolded him , then , lifting up his hands in prayer , he cried aloud :
his attendant was holding them some distance off , while he went on foot through those fighting at the front , until lord diomedes robbed him of his life
was finished with you , we set your white bones
for we are astonished , as soon as we compare the theatre public we know well with that chorus and ask ourselves whether it would be at all possible on the basis of this public to derive some idealization analogous to the tragic chorus
i came down to the sea and reached the ship
how he might get the shameless suitors in his grip , one man against so many
we should all assemble , then carry off the bodies of the deadwith mules and oxen
then atreus ' son would have easily carried off the celebrated armour of the son of panthous , if phoebus apollo had not been offended
bathed me in the river , and gave me clothes
and speak candidly—who are your people ?
while wind and helmsman held us on our course
i grieve for him much more than for my husband
they all agreed with his suggestion
now famous spearman odysseus was left alone , no achaean there beside him , for fear gripped them all
there his wife ran up to meet him , andromache , daughter of great-hearted eëtion , who would included a large dowry with her
responding to telemachus , geranian horseman nestor said :
sometimes south wind would toss it over to north wind to carry
should we desire to combine the two conceptions that have just been shown to have influenced the origin of opera , it would merely remain for us to speak of an idyllic tendency of the opera
taller and stronger , and on his head she curled
he killed great-hearted bathycles , chalcon 's dear son , who lived at home in hellas , a man pre-eminent among the myrmidons for a wealthy and successful life
odysseus led them out
keep sitting in the hall or at the door
but they had trouble standing up to hector 's charge , as he attacked the ships
may some god lead you home ,
why turn the matter now
all those schemes he 's thought up in your home
then scamander , the deep-flowing river , cried out to apollo :
godlike telemachus was the first to see him ,
nestor took a strong spear with a sharp bronze point , then stood outside the hut
many soldiersfollowed him , and he was pre-eminent in war
some spears hurled by brave hands flew swiftly forward , then stuck in his great shield , and many stood upright in the space between them , impaled in earth , still eager to devour his flesh
wagging their long tails
with pain beyond all hope
but now i really havea dreadful fear of peleus ' swift-footed son
hera , why 's your son burning up my stream , doing it more injury than any other ?
telemachus prepares for his voyage
lord odysseus then , with his trickery ,
did he do it to make sure
than give it to another man
his skin would have been stripped and all his bones smashed up ,
from your own womb you must have given birthto these long-haired achaeans
for it is the lot of every myth gradually to creep into the crevice of an assumed historical reality and to become analyzed as a unique fact in answer to the historical demands of some later time or other
according to this insight and to the tradition , dionysus , the essential stage hero and centre of the vision , was not really present in the very oldest periods of tragedy , but was only imagined as present
for i do not think you reached this place on foot
should the dionysian exist at all ?
and so the race of noble arcesius
with a sharp cry , she cradled her son 's head , then spoke
by some other man , one who had no land
once his living spirithas abandoned him , send death and sweet sleepto carry him away , back to the spacious landof lycia , where his brother and his kinsmenwill bury him with a mound and headstone
for her to show up among the suitors
remain among the living
just as those times when the stars shine bright in heaven , clustered around the glowing moon , with no wind at all , and every peak and jutting headland , every forest glade is clearly visible , when every star shines out ,
his sons came from their rooms and gathered round him in a throng—echephron ,
i am talking to the suitors most of all
let someone else take hold of it
the crewmen loosed the cables
then geranian horseman nestor began to speak
the performing artist was really at a loss how to deal with a listener who comported himself so critically ; so he , as well as the dramatist or operatic composer who inspired him , searched anxiously for the last remains of life in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment
and placed it by her side , filled with fine-spun yarn
i am not from the same wombas hector , the man who killed your comrade , that kind and powerful warrior
begging as a dear friend at your knee
let each of you go up against your manin full warrior fury
but this man wants to put the rest to shame , rule all of us , lord it over everyone
aphrodite , trying to coax some new achaean womaninto running off with one of those trojansshe loves so much , must have been caressingsome well-dressed achaean lady and scratchedher delicate hand on a golden brooch
they washed their hands , and picked up the barley grain for sprinkling
amazement came in her heart—
aeneas then said to apollo in reply :
but they could not , with that response , conceal that they themselves were , nonetheless , internally related and similar to those deposed titans and heroes
as these two were talking like this to each other , the other herdsmen came in with their swine
before his wedding day
my reputation then would be more famous ,
when circe noticed me just sitting there ,
tell me now , you muses living on olympus , which of the achaeans was first to carry off bloody trophies from the men who would just been slaughtered , when famous earthshaker turned the tides of war
or else to answer back from where we were ,
many lovely swords , with dark mountings , fell to earth , from hands and shoulders of those fighting warriors
her mother also gave her some smooth olive oil
he followed closely in the goddess ' footsteps
now fatal death has overtaken him
were swallowed up in fog
he shook his head in silence
the mother fluttered around here and there , lamenting her dear chicks
his acts would bring about his total ruin
at daybreak , i will take you there and organize an ambush
how is all this going to end up for me ?
meanwhile , odysseus and the faithful swineherd
they have met disaster through their foolishness
he sat some distance from the ships , shot off an arrow— the silver bow reverberating ominously
my orders tell meto speak to you to see if you are willing to put a stop to the harsh clash of war , until such time as we have burned our dead
then he put around his chest the body armour belonging to his brother lycaon
your comrades , over there in circe ’ s house ,
patroclus went to achilles , his people 's shepherd , shedding warm tears , like a fountain of dark water whose stream flows over the lip of a sheer rock face
after saying this , odysseus began to count the lovely tripods ,
the fruit of this condition is an ascetic condition , in which one denies the power of the will
you must enjoy our hospitality
in their hearts the suitors were amazed
is the very worst of trials for men ?
you and i alone will investigate
at once the god held back his flow ,
and three horses , too , and , as well as these ,
he may well be in orchomenus or in sandy pylos ,
my friends , we are not going down to hades ' house just yet , although we ’ re grieving , not until the day
she whipped the horses on
has hurt well-armed achaeans , and now ,
it struck him in the chest , right by the nipple
he made a stand by pandarus , like a lion , confident of its strength
two of the best working men now living could not lever that stone out of the ground easily into their cart , but hector carried it with ease alone
resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
leader of your people , that incident
this trip of ours
i feel it also in my lower limbs
so you invite this man to come as well ?
tricked me with his story
then the group surrounding sly and shrewd odysseus once more threw sharp spears into the crowd of suitors , and once again odysseus , sacker of cities ,
then darkness veiled his eyes , and his spirit left him
inside our ship was gone , they had to roam ,
and the beard around his chin turned black again
so for two days and nights he floated on the ocean waves , his heart filled
the pile of dead bodies grew , as they fell—trojans , proud allies , danaans , too , all together
when i get home
you would be disgraced among all men and shamed
glorious odysseus , you ask about your honey-sweet return
penelope , astonished , went back to her rooms ,
while i am being badly treated , even if
for i think i will hear of it
we will leave him in odysseus ' palace ,
you are not sending me back home , when you tell me to get across that huge gulf of the sea
my heart always divided in my chest ,
men of ithaca , listen to me now , hear what i have to say
odysseus , divinely bred , laertes ’ resourceful son , so you are going to fly back home ,
to his father 's palace
but anyway , now this stranger 's come here ,
beyond the courtyard , but near the door , stands an enormous orchard ,
and find delight in your own suffering ?
so you must leave quickly
there he first struck pronous with his shining spear , where pronous ' shield had left his chest exposed
my dear mother , do not bring me some sweet wine , for you will weaken me
warped his better judgment—perhaps it was
that 's how i met my fate and died , as well
who had endured so much , considered what to do
the horses flew on willingly , chests flecked with foam , their underbellies caked with dust , as they took the exhausted king away and left the battle
then old priam stood on that wall built by gods , observing huge achilles as he drove the trojans ahead of him in total panic , their spirit broken
his words had wings :
he 's urging men to give him gifts
when my elbow nudged him , he was all ears ,
and poured water out into a silver basin ,
but then swift-footed , godlike achilles spoke :
when they live well and are considered wealthy
it 's a stream of nectar and ambrosia
it 's name is not unknown—
then apollo charged out to meet achilles , seeking to protect the trojans from destruction , as they fled straight for the high-walled city , suffering from thirst and dusty from the plain
but gave them lotus plants to eat , whose fruit ,
creatures with lovely manes , quickly back to pylos
then death carried him into its shadows
you have just questioned me about
that 's how euripides must have thought about it ; that 's how he , the first sober poet must have passed sentence on the drunken poets
i replied and calmed them down :
water spilled out on the ground
they had bristles , heads , and voices just like pigs—
i say he will , then set your men on me
but jumping to one side , polydamas nimbly avoided his dark fate
let my comrades eat , then send them out
briseis , looking like golden aphrodite , then saw patroclus mutilated by sharp bronze
is really hard to sway
i think , to roam around among mankind
they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome
he 's close by , still alive in the rich land
to find out if he can recognize me ,
with this man 's singing of the evil fate
knew who i was , and with a cry of grief ,
around his chestthe bronze rang fearfully , as he moved into action , a sound to make even brave warriors afraid
these men here , they spend all their time like this , with songs and music—it 's so easy for them ,
but ships can moor there in a place with openings in both directions
what should it be called ?
he ran to those in front , calling in a loud voice :
she went on ahead of him to make things safe
so i stood upright hard against the mast
could convince his wife or his dear son
in the rear , he placed his many brave foot soldiers , a battle wall
and were keen to bring him home unharmed
by contrast , what are we to make of what killed tragedy—socratic morality , dialectic , the satisfaction and serenity of the theoretical man ?
wherever patroclus saw the biggest crowd of soldiers in retreat , with a yell he charged at them
they left the ships and came to a smooth road ,
with an amazement which was all the greater as he sensed with horror that all this may not be really foreign to him , that even his apollonian consciousness was covering the dionysian world in front of him , like a veil
further brutal war and dreadful battle ,
you would much prefer to stuff yourself with food
once i caught sight of her ,
and raise the alarm as swiftly as we can
there he walked on in the form of a young prince with his first hair on his lip , looking that age when charms of youth are at their loveliest
when the spirit bids , you can get some rest
in a distant corner of the house , where they kept
aphrodite brought , when she would led me there ,
who keep on slaughtering his flocks of sheep
do not tell me i should rinse my body off
was the only one to hesitate
in order to celebrate itself , its creatures had to sense that they were worthy of being glorified—they must see themselves again in a higher sphere , without this complete world of contemplation affecting them as an imperative or as a reproach
odysseus finished , then threw around his shoulders his ragged bag full of holes , with a twisted strap
cried out , too , all those inside the house , young and old
i know well enough i am fated to die here , far from my loving parents
there periphlegethon and cocytus ,
with these goods of mine
he would sworn an empty oath , but dolon was encouraged
not one of them
instead he hit lycophron , son of mastor , from cythera , one those attending ajax
whenever he went off to war in his black ships
i asked about the aesthetic pleasure , though i know full well that many of these images also produce at times a moral delight , for example , under the form of pity or moral triumph
enjoy our banquet , but no more shouting ,
father zeus , it seems you gods are still
in the middle of the meeting
of other people , the way men cross the sea to visit one another in their ships—
if not , i will steal your sweet life with one spear throw
the eagle released the fawn , dropping it right beside that splendid altar where achaeans sacrificed to all-knowing zeus
who had endured so much , was the first to speak :
in vain we look for a single vigorously developed root , for a spot of fertile and healthy soil : everywhere there is dust and sand ; everything has become rigid and languishes
you had died there with him
and the hearth of excellent odysseus ,
to swear a mighty oath on my behalf ,
now zeus incited them to war
telemachus , let your mother test me in these halls
sarpedon withdrew a little from the parapet , but did not retreat completely , for his heart was set on seizing glory
in there well-timbered ships can ride without being moored , phorcys was an ancient god of the sea , father of a number of monsters
all around her cave
they set him in a chariot and took him away , full of sorrow , to sacred ilion
holds out his hand to guard him
to see their skill and test them man to man
for the atrocious stench of sea-born seals
we—the sacred army of argive spearmen—
because we would been such fools , there was no breeze to help us on our way
but when achilleshas met his fate and died , then you may fightin full confidence among those at the front , for of all achaeans no one else will kill you
all of high ilionhas been destroyed
my son , whom i so love , away from home ,
one of those mortals living on the earth ,
hold off , hephaestus , splendid child
on a massive fire , while high above our heads
there with him in the palace
his house and his possessions in phoenicia
so he raced ahead and got back to the crowd ,
controls the land unchallenged and can feast in banquets with his equals , or at least
to cretheus—aeson , pheres , and amythaon—
you ’ ll stay there with the rest of them
when he stood up in well-built lesbos once
but soon enough he would rouse himself again
other gods , all through olympus , were very anxious , but just stood there , unable to untie you
zeus and other eternal gods forbid
it 's wrong to go on suffering grief for ever
standing by priam , swift-footed iris spoke , sounding like polites , priam 's son
it 's easy for the gods who hold wide heaven
and looked around for hiding places
your godlike wife by giving courtship gifts
you should recognize me—agamemnon , son of atreus , the one whom zeusalways loads with miserable fortune , more so than other men , so long as breathstays in my chest and movement in my limbs
next mentor , who would been noble odysseus ' companion ,
i will not obey you any more
is it because i am filthy ,
the finest beasts in helios ' herd
we all know that
and our finest man has perished—sarpedon , child of zeus , who would not assist his son
dione , queen among the goddesses , replied :
surely a higher pleasure must be perceived in all this
i ’ m ready to wrap my conquering handsaround my spear
the people of phaeacia , who love the oar ,
we came to thebe , eëtion 's sacred city , sacked it , taking everything the city had
how will you learn from me ,
if i leave this fine armourand patroclus , who lies here because he triedto avenge my honour , some danaan , seeing this , will call me a disgrace
blowing from your stern , so you may reach
beside it , on an angle , they made a common grave , back from the plain
just as our fathers were so long ago
that speech of yours provokes me
towards the high-roofed palace
when these foals played ,
over the sea in our swift ship , waiting
together with long-robed ctimene ,
for wretched human beings
so this stranger has his gifts in hand
as far as i am concerned ,
a portion of the meat , set it in front of him , and lifted some bread for him out of the basket
you see in me the use of poetry—
just as for mortal men zeus bends his coloured rainbow down from heaven , an omen prophesying war or some harsh storm , upsetting flocks and stopping men from workupon the earth—that 's how athena then placed herself in the achaean throng , wrapped in a purple mist
you will soon be with the swine
so long as war-loving meleager was in the fight , the curetes did not do well
are close relations of the gods
wide-ruling agamemnon grabbed the spear in his fists and yanked it towards him with the fury of a lion , pulling it away , right out of iphidamas ' hands
i was carried by the wind from troy
philoetius , and eumaeus , and told them all
that 's what they said
in that crowd , men 's hearts were set to slaughter one another with sharp bronze
they must attach the rope ends there as well
because we carried everyone in safety
in days gone by might come
has ever yet been sure about his parents
in his home he honoured her the way he did
so now the spirit here in my own chestis even keener than before to fight
lord odysseus sat down there
when patroclus had cut the trojans ' front ranks off , he pushed them back again towards the ships , keeping them from the city they were trying to reach
and made it shake
eumaeus also prayed like that to all the gods
but this time , he was up and roaming well ahead of me
least of all the reality of this world of appearance , for it says to us : look there !
fighting hard in battle after battle ,
in front of him he held his spear and a round shield , eager to kill anyone who might come at him
tell me now , you muses inhabiting olympus , who was the first to come against agamemnon— one of the trojans or one of their famous allies ?
there are many herds and flocks , plenty of wine ,
we think that you are a matchfor swirling xanthus in a fight
and all this treasure here ,
where you made many sacrificial gifts
the son of tydeus picked up a stone , a massive rock which no two men now alive could lift
by her dear children , by alcinous himself ,
you are here , and you babble all the time
they learned to work from the immortal gods
instead , they crept away , whimpering in fear , to the far side of the hut
father , i am here—the very man you asked about
your life is fated to be short—you will not live long
and we do not know
and he was there , covered with blood and gore ,
i have no objection , my child , to providing mules for you ,
or fights will happen here
struck the woman , and she fell with a thud
and i will describe for you every detail ,
for mighty agamemnon calls for you to look at warrior menelaus , achaea ’ s leader ,
but still , i answered him by saying :
you have a man like this one ,
both gods had a common father— the same family , too—but zeus was older and more wise
telemachus stopped him and said :
her feet are soft , she walks , not on the ground , but on men 's heads , and she brings folly onto humankind , seducing them at random
let us ask ourselves whether the feverish and uncanny excitement of this culture is anything but the greedy seizing and snatching at food of a hungry man -- and who would care to contribute anything to a culture that can not be satisfied no matter how much it devours , and at whose contact the most vigorous and wholesome nourishment is changed into history and criticism ?
though she was sad , it was a pleasure for me
am the thirteenth king
he will bring men to help him
with a grieving heart , hephaestus went up to his home , stood at the front door , where a cruel anger gripped him
son of atreus , which god helped your plan and forged a scheme so you could lie in wait
when they reached the stream of the fair-flowing river , where the washing tubs were always standing ready , full of fresh water flowing up from underneath
to drown , to sink --
not if you are eager to return
was happy listening , and sleep did not come down across her eyelids until he would told it all
hoping in his heart he would string that bow and shoot an arrow through the iron
goddess themis , do not question me like this
and oil we cleaned your lovely skin
zeus , the cloud gatherer , spoke out in response :
then rushed up to pull their spears out of the dead
her heart cared about him , so she cast around him an amazing mist
but my crew , overcome with arrogance ,
shame on you lycians !
is something i ca not bear
you two ajaxes , now you must get your joy protecting us , as you have done before , but even better
a plea , especially to eurymachus and godlike antinous , since what he said
the first to kill a man was teucer , son of telamon
just as a terrifying fire rages through deep woodson a parched mountain , burning dense stands of trees , as the driving wind blows flames to every spot , that how achilles , like a god , raged with his spear , attacking and killing men all through the fight
a place whose name no one should ever speak
i know machaon , his people 's shepherd
athena , goddess with the gleaming eyes , then said to him :
we hauled up our ships , took down all the sails , went up along the shore , and fell asleep ,
the killing of the suitors
who stood apart was the shade of ajax ,
she quickly dropped into the wine they were enjoying a drug which eased men 's pains and irritations ,
he took this stool , placed it by telemachus ' table , facing him ,
in his chest his heart was hoping
as far as the first is concerned , the text is largely irrelevant
that 's what he wanted , i suppose
and this table welcoming your guests ,
pylaemenes , a brave soldier , commanded paphlagoniansfrom enetae , where herds of mules run wild , men from cytorus , from around sesamus , those with fine homes by the stream parthenius , from cromna , aegialus , high erithini
she gives hope to each of us , makes promises
shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
the only one who beat me with the bow
amphidamas then gave the cap to molus , as a present for his hospitality
the gates of heaven scraped open on their own
and set the bed up in a different spot
just as he was when he went with the troops
for there 's nothing more shameless than a wretched stomach ,
one would not select any men but these
dear phoebus , go down to bronze-armed hector
amphimedon 's shade then answered him and said :
in her upper room , the daughter of icarius ,
each man looked around to see how he might flee complete destruction
then father zeus , enthroned on high , put fear in ajax
that 's what they would say , and their remarks
his sword sliced away his arms and slashed his head off
a tear ran down his cheek onto the ground—till then he would held himself in check
then athena , goddess with the gleaming eyes ,
enraged that you destroyed his dear son 's eye
which laertes had once won by his own efforts ,
when lord odysseus , who would endured so much , saw her , he was glad and quickly spoke up to telemachus ,
but hector killed only one man— periphetes of mycenae , dear son of copreus , who used to take messages from king eurystheusto mighty hercules
these the swineherd , a splendid man , had raised himself
a name which never should be mentioned
i will lie down on the black hollow ship tonight
but i will tell you this—remember it well— i will not raise my hand to fight about that girl , no , not against you or any other man
my friend , i thought you hada better mind than any other manliving in fertile lycia
for i do not think that you were born and raised
then he picked up a swift arrow lying by itself
i am asking you to follow these instructions—
comes to our city
then the two of them sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree
they reached us in the morning , thick as leaves
his words had wings :
then draw that sharp sword on your thigh and charge , just as if you meant to slaughter her
no other man can match the way i serve
he was the finest looking man i saw
i will try to mediate their endless quarrel
whom i left behind
give me a swift ship and twenty comrades ,
he went to his death with the same tranquility plato describes him showing as he leaves the symposium , the last drinker in the early light of dawn , beginning a new day , while behind him , on the benches and the ground , his sleeping dinner companions stay behind , to dream of socrates the truly erotic man
storm-footed iris rushed off with the message
telemachus has only just grown up ,
my mother picks up from those soothsayers
i never met him , never even saw him ,
once he would finished speaking ,
wine has seized your wits ,
i tied the huge creature 's feet together ,
and care for him
men and horses are all shrouded in this mist
zeus sent a favouring wind
to take his seat inside the hall and eat his meal beside telemachus
odysseus restrained them , kept them in check ,
if so , then you are no son of tydeus , the son of warlike oeneus
we went to sleep , each man with his weapons , along the river bank
with the immense impact of the image , the concept , the ethical teaching , and the sympathetic emotion , the apollinian tears man from his orgiastic self-annihilation and blinds him to the universality of the dionysian process , deluding him into the belief that he is seeing a single image of the world ( tristan and isolde , for instance ) , and that , through music , he is merely supposed to see it still better and more profoundly
something sweet to satisfy their hearts , slaughtering
first , he set out prizes for swift charioteers— for the winner , a woman skilled in fine handicrafts and a tripod with handles holding twenty measures
i could transgress what zeus has ordered
we would taken many jars for everyone
cutting across this gulf , but i ca not find
athena poured beauty on him in large amounts to make him taller , more robust to look at , and on his head she made his hair
in this sense , it is precisely the tragic myth that has to convince us that even the ugly and disharmonic are part of an artistic game that the will in the eternal amplitude of its pleasure plays with itself
about the anger of the gods or the dining table
he went back to the door , sat there ,
they brought in godlike telemachus , asking him
thus , thoas ruled alone
threw him decisively , and all achaeans
hector sliced his wrist , and so his fighting ended
there were no rocks , and it was sheltered from the wind
it 's now the twentieth year since he went off
hector was annoyed— his weapon had flown from his hand and missed its mark
after being away so long
son of atreus , how can such words as thesecome from your mouth ?
if he misses the bird and hits the cord , he will be less successful , but he will take as prizethese single-bladed axes
i did not learn a thing
then from a mountain peak
now , you should eat before you leave
to the waters of that zeus-fed river ,
olympian zeus himself gives happiness to bad and worthy men ,
this said , antinous called out to melanthius ,
grant that telemachus and i get back ,
for he will fight when the spirit in his chest moves him , or when god drives him to it
and my two feet
that 's what the spirit of teiresias
but still , the oath , lambs ' blood , unmixed libations , handshakes , things in which we placed our trust—all these will not go in vain
as did telemachus and menelaus , too ,
i do not believe there are any mortal men
i would met with every hospitality
both were keen to get the judgment from an arbitration
menelaus found him putting his fine armour on by his ship 's stern
at once he asked the loud-voiced heralds to summon all the long-haired achaeans to assembly
the man who sent meis honourable but quick to take offence
but odysseus returned into the hut
at their communal feasts , my own altarnever went without the proper offerings , libations and sacrificial smoke ,
this is your life , this is the hand on the clock of your existence
grapes are drying in the sun
who you give orders to , will take me there ,
that 's the man whose people you are now keen to favour
he shows us , with his awe-inspiring gestures , how the entire world of torment is necessary , so that through it the individual is pushed to create the redemptive vision and then , absorbed in contemplation of that vision , sits quietly in his rowboat , tossing around in the middle of the ocean
so they could wash then beside them she pulled up a polished table
nastes led the carians , men with a strange language , from miletus , phthires , with its wooded mountain , maeander 's waters and high peaks of mount mycale
achilles served the meat and sat down by the wall , directly opposite godlike odysseus
queen hera with her crafty mind then answered zeus :
we are from ithaca below mount neion
of all the treasured gifts stored in my home ,
then godlike theoclymenus addressed them all :
then on this grain-giving earth his fame
prophesied to me when i descended
alcinous then answered him and said :
then the daughters of the old man of the sea
about the marriage , though i am upset
just as a bull grunts when it grazes in a meadow , that how the key 's force made the fine door creak , and it quickly swung ajar
men thrashed around , back and forth , as they were sucked down in the current screaming
to tell the truth , no greek artist handled his public over a long lifetime with greater daring and self-satisfaction than euripides
then answered him and said :
once odysseus spoke , the old woman left the room to fetch water for his feet , since what she would had before had all been spilled
the gods were not unwilling this man came
with what he would said
and spoke out to odysseus :
of his return—how he came home and then
stand by me as you did my father , lord tydeus , at thebes , that time he wentas messenger , sent there by achaeans
he bids the other trojans , all achaeans ,
a kind reception with the many things
my friend , since you are so resolved in your denials ,
grazing near the dark-prowed ship
prepare yourselves for hard strife , but believe in the miracles of your god
but at this point it 's the other people
to all those suitors you will appear disgusting ,
he was very much afraid for the achaean ships
there was no other challenge he could dream up more difficult for me
with a shout , he went after them , taking ranks of trojans with him
to cook his dinner
mycenaeans , willing to comply , agreed
that is , in his transformed state he sees a new vision outside himself as an apollonian fulfillment of his condition
do you think this is another trick ?
you must not look
many arcadians came in every ship , skilled fighters
all that seem to be something accidental , a reminder of the origin of tragedy which we can well do without , because we have come to realize that the chorus can be understood only as the origin of tragedy and the tragic in general
what 's happened now , my friends , has come about
all of you sitting here , without heart , disgraced like this , may all of you dissolve , disintegrate to earth and water
they followed him , making a huge noise
but the life-nourishing earth
and now light from the sun would have gone down on them , as they wept , if telemachus had not spoken
strange lady , to you those who live on mount olympus
i left them and came to troy to fight on foot , relying on my expertise in archery
this man here is indeed , as you have said ,
you will not be avenged
to marry my mother and then possess
therefore euripides set up the prologue even before the exposition and put it in the mouth of a person whom people could trust—a divinity would necessarily confirm the outcome of the tragedy for the public , more or less , and take away any doubts about the reality of the myth , in a manner similar to the way in which descartes could establish the reality of the empirical world through an appeal to the truthfulness of god and his inability to lie
he proceeded through the house to tell penelope the news
after i have looked over my estates
i ordered them to quickly fling on board
to overcome me when , weak as i am ,
inside the house , begging from the people ?
it does not get incensed without a reason
when he went off to troy
eurymachus , polybus ' son , then spoke out in reply :
set my hands on the colossal main mast
the land behind them was black , looking as though it had just been ploughed , though it was made of gold—an amazing piece of work !
i have excellent sons and many soldiers
they all helped pick her up , almost dead from shock
did not see him as he moved across the city
and cunning of a sort we never hear about
stranger , since you are keen to reach the city ,
on the other side , glorious hector organized his men
electrum , silver , ivory—to me
with cables on the stern
hermes the guide , killer of argus , hearing zeus , did not disobey
you insatiable creature , quite shameless
charge ahead , you horse-taming trojans
and their disgraceful conduct , any man
to get some sleep , i will come to collect them
and where are your parents ?
inside the hall—i would have pleased your heart
you heard me earlier , when i prayed to you
would have made a tomb for you—for your son
next in came the horses driven by antilochus , grandson of neleus , who just beat menelaus— he won by cunning , not by his horses ' speed
just as a man constructs a wall for some high house , using well-fitted stones to keep out forceful winds , that 's how close their helmets and bossed shields lined up , shield pressing against shield , helmet against helmet , man against man
that 's what they said
it stood there , while trojans sat and talked around it , confused what they should do
for , more than anyone , i am weighed down
since the power in this house is mine
yes , my child , may you always think about
odysseus finished and then , still wrapped up in his cloak , picked up a hefty discus , bigger than the others , much heavier than the ones used by phaeacians
my loyal crewmates quickly pulled out wax
then priam , descendant of dardanus , addressed them all :
i sent him ahead with my noble comrades ,
so shut your mouth
the centaur , in brave perithous ' house ,
wise penelope then answered him :
for , in fact , gods make themselves appear
or for heralds who do the people 's work
hides crept along the ground , while on the spits the meat began to bellow , and a sound
to sell me off for an enormous profit
the fight between centaurs and men began
only deïphobus and brave helenushave gone back , both wounded in the arm—hit by a long spear—but zeus saved them from death
however , if we ask ourselves to indicate , briefly and without claiming to say anything in detail , what euripides might have in common with menander and philemon and what was so excitingly exemplary and effective for them in euripides , it is enough to say that the spectator in euripides is brought up onto the stage
first i got out from underneath its gut
but as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared , they hurried to the ship and loaded on the bronze , which strengthens men
if you have ever loved my father , stood by his side in murderous combat , be my friend now
and your heart 's satisfied , you can tell me
they then reached the lofty hut of peleus ' son , which myrmidons had built there for their king , cutting pine beams for it , then roofing it with downy reedsgathered from the meadows
they bear no young and never die
we are afraid of yet—not telemachus ,
so go now , challenge war-loving menelausto fight again in single combat
well , nobody , i will eat all your companions before you
achilles then stood up , and addressed the argives :
may hera 's loud-thundering husband , zeus ,
as the stone sank , the sea surged under it , waves pushed us back
no doubt here in these halls you have often prayed that my goal of a sweet return would stay
you have now won my heart , though it 's been truly stubborn
keep it in mind
whose mind has had all sense knocked out of it
alcinous , it 's not at all appropriate
when you are bowed down with a ripe old age , and your people prospering around you
cyclops , take this wine and drink it , now you have had your meal of human flesh , so you may know
as this was happening , on a peak of mount olympus hera of the golden throne was standing watching
some god will overcome those noble suitors ,
his words stirred up athena , who was already keen
but the reply they heard was harsh
cadmus ' daughter , once a mortal being with human speech , but now , deep in the sea , she was leucothea
tlepolemus raised his ash spear high
a skillful artisan whom pallas athena
he directed them right at the fire , then told them to start working
do not show contempt for what they have to say or insult their coming here
where they held public debates
though not too many people live on it ,
against these men , after he got back ?
our ship sailed on , away from ocean 's stream ,
what sorrow nowhas come into your heart ?
and there is no one there to help him
inside that well-decked ship
his son , the warrior antiphus , had sailed to troy , that horse-rich city , along with lord odysseus ,
go there , heroic man , and follow my instructions—
my friends , leaders and rulers of argives , am i the only one to see those horses , or can you glimpse them , too ?
mentor , help fight off disaster
as his mind thought it through , the latter course of action seemed the better choice , to clasp the knees of laertes ' son , odysseus
when they would enjoyed their food , the girl and her attendants threw their head scarves off to play catch with a ball , and white-armed nausicaa led them in song
now , see if you can cope with my bronze point
to cry for any mortal man who 's died
but the great man cebriones , proud of his glory , just lay there in the swirling dust , his horsemanship now quite forgotten
when they saw that , they were happy—in all their chests the spirits filled with joy
but you are older
or any noise from men within these walls ,
he wants to see you and get your advice ,
once he would said this , peisistratus drove his horses ,
and on the tomb there fix the oar i used
he sang about the various ways those warriors
more so than other men
ask me questions about anything except
for now we fight ourselves , arguing like this
her scheme did not go well
for you , too , are made of mortal stuff
and grandsons of great hercules had threatened him
and have no knowledge of ships painted red or well-made oars that serve those ships as wings
the many epeians on board were commanded by amphimachus , son of cteatus , and thalpius , son of eurytus , descended both from actor
good ones , too , could not have shifted it
he shuddered , for he perceived how high-thundering zeus was denying completely all his fighting skill , wanting the trojans to prevail
but all by himself he 's snatched a bodyfrom the trojans and gone off with it
still sucking on the teat , not yet broken
not one of them dared look directly at those weapons
and as myth died with you , so died the genius of music as well
inside the high-roofed house , with his noble wife , who had prepared the bed , lying down beside him
had seemed the best
he 's taking a huge stash of glorious loot—
each of them in turn , standing by the boat
alas , this is great sorrow for achaeans
more beautiful , as well
for as long as he 's alive , i do not think
she died a wretched death
speeds on her way , then turn her into stone
looking down from pergamus , apollo grew annoyed
the best man brings up his sure-footed horsesin last place
so i can lie down by myself
the goddesses moved stealthily , like wild pigeons , eager to assist the argive troops
since my husband 's now been so long absent
this beast from the gods reached oeneus ' orchardand was causing serious damage there , knocking tall plants to the ground , entire trees , including roots and flowering apples
since lord odysseus is dead , but i
the swift arrows tumbled out
so he asked zeus what plan he had in mind :
eumaeus and the rest of you , his work mates ,
two rails run round it
so it must be the case that the fine sonof menoetius is dead , that reckless man
if i had power , i would defend myself ,
and fill your stomach
promise apollo , illustrious archer born in lycia , you will make fine sacrifice , some new-born lambs , once you get back to your city , holy zeleia
whose voice is like a god 's
young men have , who then seek judgment ,
they lack all discretion , all sense of justice ,
in her grief over her brothers ’ killing , she prayed to the gods , beating fertile earthwith her hands over and over , kneeling down , her breasts wet from crying , begging hades and fearful persephone to kill her son
but now , in my mind , i have got this dreadful fear that thetis , silver-footed daughter of the old man of the sea , has won you over , for this morning early , she sat down beside you , held your knees
have a pleasant dinner in odysseus ' home
i chose two of my men
and then i noticed mighty hercules ,
with countless fine things set before him
he has no peers
across my shoulder , grabbed my bow , and told him to take me back there on the selfsame trail
i found my trusty comrades at the ship
should end it themselves
once the thighs had been completely burned and they would sampled innards ,
among the cyclopes , grain-bearing earth grows clusters of rich grapes , which zeus ' rain increases , but this drink—
your attendant 's weak , your horses slow
but apollo himself stirred up aeneas , taking on the form of periphas , the herald , son of epytos , who would grown old serving as herald to aeneas ' old father
the divine hair on the king of gods fell forward , down over his immortal head , shaking olympus to its very base
stranger , since you ask me questions about this , stay quiet , enjoy yourself , drink your wine ,
this pressure and the rays of helios ,
take their fast horses out of harness ,
i say it 's better to be slaughtering wild beasts , deer in the mountains , than to fight all outwith those more powerful
nothing 's more miserable for human beings
a constant din arosearound great nestor and warlike idomeneus
to stand her ground was alcinous ' daughter
danaans poured out from among the ships throughout the constant uproar
a practical pessimism , which could give rise to a dreadful ethic of mass murder out of sympathy , such a belief is present and was present all over the world , wherever art did not appear in some form or other , especially in religion and science , as a remedy and a defense against that pestilence
she spoke , and her eyes glanced over at penelope , anxious to tell her that her husband had come home
having said this , swift-footed iris went away
for my mind is just , and inside my chest
shades of the dead—brides , young unmarried men ,
some god breaks me apart , i will go on—
he despises you , your gifts , and tells youto think for yourself with the argiveshow you may save achaean ships and men
trojans could not break through , get past danaan ranks to assault the ships and huts
fully armed , he quickly jumped down from his chariot to the ground
on a raft of wood well lashed together
excited by their master 's shout , his horses ran on even faster
nor any mortal men
bright-eyed athena smiled and stroked him with her hand
he 's a child no longer
the fast horses swerved
let them love each other as they used to do ,
is no doubt done for
while we were occupied with all these tasks , circe was well aware of our return
he changed the armour so it suited hector 's body
you have not been a fool
and stop them drinking dark blood all at once
warmer water to it
the men dispersed , each man to his own house
without being favoured by the gods
the first shade to appear out of the pit was my companion elpenor , whose corpse
then i gave orders we should leave on foot—
his fair share of the trophies with him
as they embarked , i observed their leader ,
would tell agamemnon , son of atreus ,
so come now , give him the polished bow ,
each suitor , quite astonished , would glance at the man beside him and then mutter words like these :
he escaped your throw all on his own
he saw both ajaxes , so keen for war , standing there
with his spear , aeneas then struck down leocritus , son of arisbas , the courageous companion of lycomedes
he would broken in his well-built home in eleon
and apollo , far-shooting god , make hector
once he would roasted them completely , he picked them up and , without taking out the spits , carried them still hot over to odysseus
three times i poured some out and gave it to him ,
the finest of all fattened hogs for them to eat
let it be your treasure , in memory of patroclus ' burial
lady , we have not yet come
it 's hard for me , though i am a powerful man , to attackso many men and battle with them all
but in the morning let us all assemble ,
the two of us wo not say goodbye , until
renowned odysseus , great glory of achaeans , tell me how you two obtained these horses
in his fury with the suitors , those men
lycaon 's fine son then said in reply :
that what i said
so you must leave this island with all speed
if i threw , if my bronze spear hit youin the middle of your body , then no matterwhat your courage , or how much trust you placein your strong hands , you would quickly give me glory , and your life to famous horseman hades
then phoebus apollo spoke out to achilles :
with these words , nestor hurried through the ditch
who leaned back and fell asleep
then you would know the kind of strength i have
but he came back and , sitting on a beam
or have they died and gone to hades ' home ?
i did many reckless things
down to my swift ship and to my comrades
for i get such astonishing delight
now that you have all finished eating ,
a moment to look forward to
could i somehow be
brought us disaster—he made that our fate ,
do you think the blame rests with your kinsmen ,
to your well-built home and native land
for the armies of horse-taming trojans and achaeans had only just begun to march against each other
or perhaps in sparta with menelaus
and what about morality itself ?
for the gods were with us when we came
keep silent for the moment , in case one of our achaeans hears you
twisted it around—just as a shipwright
i will kill you , and you will pass through hades ' gate
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
well now , this is strange indeed—to my home has come
but the beast got the jump on him and struck him above the knee , charging at him from the side , a long gash in his flesh sliced by its tusk , but it did not reach odysseus ' bone
even in my dreams
i do not , nor do the others here with me
and above all , it is through music that the tragic spectator is overcome by an assured premonition of a highest pleasure attained through destruction and negation , so he feels as if the innermost abyss of things spoke to him perceptibly
then cloud-gatherer zeus , irritated , said to her :
rouse danaansto battle hard
he would been there , on watch , for one whole year , just in case agamemnon should succeed in getting back
his loyal companions retrieved it
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered her and said :
so they immediately got up and went away
the life of ajax , such a splendid man ,
aeneas cowered down , holding the shield out away from him in terror
i fathered sons , the best in spacious troy
i have returned here in the twentieth year ,
because he is unable to behold a vision , he forces the machinist and the decorative artist into his service
mighty agamemnon then speared him in the side
but when he sawbarbs of the arrow head , its binding , still outside , not underneath the skin , his spirits rose , and courageflowed back into his chest
then his lovely wife , in a quarrel over who should get credit for first wounding the great wild boar , meleager had killed his mother ’ s brothers
at other times i have held back from war , but not this time
but athena approached odysseus , laertes ' son , and urged him to collect bread from the suitors , so he might find out those who did respect the law and those who flouted their traditions
eurymachus , all you other noble suitors , no longer
they washed , rubbing lots of smooth oil on themselves , then sat down to eat
she stood beside the door post of the well-built room and , holding a bright veil across her countenance ,
i would died as well and met my fate that day
once xanthus had said this , the erinyes removed his voice
or perhaps a stranger did—odysseus
by what you have said
and kissed life-giving earth
and to the outer limits of the earth—
the first drops for libations
now he plans a cruel trick , tells me to return to argos dishonoured , after i have lost so many warriors
once we would made it past those rocks and fled ,
with her lovely voice calypso sang inside the cave , as she moved
zeus seated himself upon his throne
he sat down behind odysseus and pulled the arrow from his foot
in their hollow ship have carried away
when hera spoke , hephaestus extinguished his stupendous fire at once
geranian horseman nestor led these menin a flotilla of ninety hollow ships
and then murdered him , once the man came home
but my heart is torn
but as the days and months went by , bringing
stranger , you look different to me than you did before—
do not let forgetfulness seize your mind , when honey sleep has loosed his sweet grip on you
it protected heads of brave young men
that one of them can not still somehow
i choose with care and then deliver them
the instantaneous , the witty , the foolish , and the capricious—these are its loftiest divinities , the fifth state , that of the slave ( or at least the feelings of a slave ) now come to rule
then medon , an intelligent man , said to her :
my child , do not blame her now about such things
the richly woven garments she herself had made
i myself will look at them
so both gods lay there , on the all-nourishing earth
it would be inappropriate for me
here on this sea-girt island , we could make
where i moored my curving ships
many shady mountains and the roaring sea stand there between us
menestheus , son of peteos , led these men
that fame you haveas a courageous warrior is misplaced
more than any other of his comrades—
hector then called out to peleus ' noble son :
shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
anchises ' strong son was not unwilling
about my lady , although servants have
my sharp bronze , i think , can slice up his flesh , too
to them this feminine flight from seriousness and terror , this cowardly self-satisfaction with comfortable consumption , seemed not only despicable but also the essentially anti-christian frame of mind
he was dreadfully afraid
off to sacred pylos and holy sparta
they have taught you all sorts of things with horses , so there 's no need to issue you instructions
people call this star by the name orion 's dog
the gods bring miseries to wandering men ,
will be returning home has been wiped out
and do not let your mind and heart
but from the others i will not back away ,
for now—and i say this because you asked—
how this matter can best resolve itself
squandering a fine man 's property and then
telemachus , the gods themselves , it seems , are teaching you to be a braggart
and their demonstration diagnosed for the first time the illusory notion which pretends to be able to fathom the innermost essence of things with the aid of causality
the fourth brought water in ,
you scampered off , down mount ida 's slopes , and quickly , too
in our house we honored him just as we didour parents
son of tydeus , what 's the matter with us ?
weeping , they picked the white bones of their comrade out and put them in a double layer of fat inside a golden urn
as a result of euripides , the man of ordinary life pushed his way out of the spectators ' space and up onto the acting area
and pick me something truly beautiful
achilles , when he saw him , jumped out and roared in triumph :
the fleet was soon prepared
this was poetry 's new position , the place into which plato forced it under the influence of the daemonic socrates
now i will describe for you each and every one of circe ’ s fatal ploys
the day that you will return
things to grieve about
he instructed him to take them to the hollow ships
my dear child , things are indeed just as you say
but i would like to ask you , my good man ,
we came to tenedos and sacrificed
not when he rises into starry heaven ,
he makes me tremble—i am so afraid
but if you harm them , then i foresee destruction for your ship
trojans must be timid men
he went off and , standing beside odysseus ,
i ran out straight ahead ,
odysseus , a man of many schemes , then answered her and said :
they asked me and famous idomeneus
with spear-fighter peisistratus , leader of men ,
the same ship brought us here
with no work skills or strength , just a burden
have planned something disastrous
with their mistress and find out everything ,
zeus spoke and then instructed hermes , his dear son :
he comes by birth from a good father
to wear fresh garments on your person
and they would had a taste of inner organs ,
inside the doorway with a fearful glare
that 's how terrible his resolution is
but the shaker of the earth had not forgotten
what i was looking for
just as a leopard emerges from thick undergrowth , to face a hunter , with no fear in its heart ,
to the gods , and portion out the land for farming
making libations to honour keen-eyed hermes ,
without a lively pathological interest , he says , i , too , have never yet succeeded in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind , and hence i have rather avoided than sought it
and then into a serpent and a leopard ,
limb from limb , right here
menelaus and aeneas , now faced each other , with eager hands and spears , ready to begin the fight
addressing each of them in turn , he ordered them to pray to all the gods
for being so angry
worn out in war , i reach my ships with something fine but small
at once he saw a shameful sight— achaeans in retreat , pushed back by their enemies , high-hearted trojans
antinous , it 's quite impossible for me to eat
he said these words , to hold down the heart within his chest , and his spirit submitted , enduring everything with resolution
idomeneus had come from the curving ships that day on foot and would have given the trojans a great triumph , if coeranus had not quickly driven up with his swift-footed horses
athena spoke , and much-enduring lord odysseus
talked to them with reassuring words and said :
the brutal fight began again among the ships
then he would scatter this presumption ,
when they would satisfied their need for food and drink , then priam , son of dardanus , looked at achilles , wondering at his size and beauty , like gazingface to face upon a god
poseidon , sent at me
or bring back word to us—they wished to stay ,
until death 's black cloud came to embrace us
first , he set up the axes
once i would made it over to the gateway
the island where fair-haired calypso lives ,
the hospitality i give my guests
kept talking to each other
they would gone off to gather large rocks for the wall around the vineyard , with the old man in the lead
with these words , eurymachus pulled out his sword , a sharp two-edged blade of bronze , and then charged out straight at odysseus , with a blood-curdling shout
deadly things , so horrible to others
you will steer your ship at it , illustrious odysseus
and my intelligence , if you dine here ,
mighty earthshaker , what strange things you say !
then we will collect bones from patroclus , menoetius ' son , separating them with carefrom all the rest
as she went back and forth before her loom ,
but if we are
now , if all those of us who protect danaans were to agree to drive the trojans back , we would leave wide-seeing zeus up there by himself , sulking where he sits alone on ida
that would be the cause of some disgrace
you gods are cruel and vindictive
bloodstained ares ' long spear struck it
in case someone robs me and removes it
in a mighty lion 's den and then gone roaming
like plato , he assigned it to the art of cosmetics , which present only a pleasant surface , not the useful , and he therefore demanded that his disciples abstain and stay away from such unphilosophical temptations , with so much success that the young poet of tragedy , plato , immediately burned his poetical writing in order to be able to become socrates 's student
grieving for dear shipmates we had lost ,
that made the beggar irus angry , so he said :
then go back to your ship with your spirit
and give her to the man he feels he likes ,
so the gods , givers of good things , stood in the doorway , looking at the artful work of ingenious hephaestus
there are plenty of achaean women in hellas and in phthia—daughters of lords , men who govern cities
by attacking us , these trojans were the first to violate their oaths
but poseidon did not laugh
helios , i think you should keep on shining for immortals
as i was remembering odysseus ,
then they could storm heaven
father zeus will never help those liars
telemachus walked away to the ocean shore
hence , they lack blood , and men call them immortal
the spirits , ghosts of the dead , keep me away
to make me groan and grieve still more ?
with both his hands he pulled up the purple cloak to hide his eyes
at this speech argives gave out an enormous cheer
with her own hands she combed her shining locks in braids , a stunning style for an immortal goddess
i had twelve ships with me , and each of them
although of all the gods who hold olympus
every time he tried to dash for the dardanian gates to get underneath the walls , so men on top could come to his assistance by hurling spears , achilles would intercept him and turn him back towards the plain , always making sure he kept running a line between hector and the city
the keen-eyed killer of argus told him
all those men as much as i do one man ,
telemachus , this bird flying to our right
once she would raised them , their royal mother
in astonishment he turned
with himwent teucer , his brother , both from the same father
but zeus , grant me now at least this prayer—let us get out of here alive , in safety
shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
some of our people who saw that island
first , let your eyes inspect this scar—a boar
that was the man
to me to have good sense , so act as follows—
to stop their slurs , their insults , you wo not let them wash your feet
and your mind 's unfeeling
for you love war , constant strife and battle
for zeus , son of cronos , has not given
deïphobus , son of priam , moved out before them , full of ambitious hopes
there are none left for us to pass around
release my dear child to me
than going on foot , because the washing tubs
as he approached , odysseus , his father , got up
as you visit the farms , while those others ,
while at home aegisthus planned the murder
but he struck his chest and said , as a rebuke to his own heart :
the robes and sashes
once that goes , no matter how keen a man may be , he can no longer continue in the war
but aeneas was not their sole commander
and by trading filled their hollow ship with goods
then pallas athena gave diomedes , son of tydeus , strength and courage , so among all argives , he would stand out and win heroic glory
bolt and lash them shut
in this totally strange character instinctive wisdom reveals itself only in order to confront the conscious knowledge now and then as an impediment
right now they shake with fear in front of you , like bleating goats confronted by a lion
then a third one joined them , philoetius , an outstanding man , bringing in
so autolycus then answered her and said :
meanwhile , a herald brought him
as dawn rose from her bed beside lord tithonus , bringing light to immortal gods and men alike , zeus sent strife down to the fast achaean ships , the savage goddess , carrying the sign of war
after saying this , achilles ordered automedon , his close companion , to fetch the breastplate from the hut
the gods charged off to battle , their hearts divided in two groups
entertain any further nasty words
i do not know if some god was urging him
where there 's an old debt they still owe me ,
but perhaps some god will inspire the hearts in both your chests , so you two can stand firm
but come , i will tell you
where are deïphobus , brave prince helenus , adamas , son of asius , and asius , son of hyrtacus ?
my queen , i wish that what you have just described were the worst of it
at once to the woman 's quarters in disgrace
the fine leather strap stretched round paris ' soft neck , right below his chin , was strangling him to death
they ’ d drawn their ships on shore beside the blue-gray sea ,
odysseus then made this entreaty :
give me strength , so i can call my lycian comrades , urge them on to war ,
already in sophocles the chorus reveals itself as something of an embarrassment , an important indication that even with him the dionysian stage of tragedy was beginning to fall apart
and brought them to ithaca , where laertes
you are achaean women , not warriors
the people then had trouble restraining the old man in his frantic grief , his desperate wish to go through the dardanian gate
at parnassus , where i keep my property ,
all those other men , the noble suitors ,
across the stone threshold
he stood above my head and spoke these words : 'you are sleeping , son of fiery atreus , tamer of horses
but come now , listen to me
for with the paphlagonians he would welcomed paris as his guest
do we know , my divinely cherished menelaus ,
you tell me to end my cries and suffering ,
fare you well , o queen , through all your years , until old age and death arrive , the fate
i will be looking like a beggar ,
penelope was quiet—no winged words flew from her
well , once we would left troy , we sailed together ,
that famous spearman meges , son of phyleus , coming up close , drove a sharp spear in his neck , into the nape behind his head
were busy in the hall , children of springs ,
insults me later on—among the people
people should have expelled him beyond the borders as something enigmatic , unclassifiable , and inexplicable , so that some future world could not justly charge the athenians with acting shamefully
his words had wings :
the sensation of this contrast , this game back and forth , is basically what expresses itself in the totality of the song and what , in general , creates the lyrical state
once goatherd melanthius said this , he climbed a flight of stairs inside the palace , up to odysseus ' storerooms
she found helen in her room , weaving a large cloth , a double purple cloak , creating pictures of the many battle scenes between horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans , wars they suffered for her sake at the hands of ares
the bloody limb fell on the ground
standing around you , the danaans wept ,
prepare yourselfto shoot a swift arrow at menelaus
far from the city , or else on the road
for my heart 's on fireto help trojans , who really miss me when i am gone
and speak the truth—did you see any comrades ,
you were pre-eminent among all men
so do not give our fathers honours high as mine
you could tell me something of his death ,
when the two of them
i was not attacked and killed in my own home by gentle arrows of the keen-eyed archer ,
he will be worse off , and , with these men here ,
do not let me offend you , king menelaus
the son of crooked-minded cronos gave youa two-edged gift—he gave you honourto govern all men with your sceptre , but he did not give the strongest power , courage
eumaeus spoke and offered to eternal gods
from the essence of art as it is commonly understood according to the single categories of illusion and beauty it is genuinely impossible to derive the tragic
so dismiss them from the pyre for now
soon enough , they would be running back , filling the gullieswith their dead , if mighty agamemnon treated me with kindness—but now they fightall through our camp
once those two had seen it
of course , set apart from all the rash hopes and the defective practical applications to present times with which i then ruined my first book , the great dionysian question mark remains still standing , as it is set out there ( also in relation to music ) : how should a music be created which is no longer romantic in origin ( like the german ) but dionysian ?
in the meantime , i have a dreadful fear that flies may burrowin those wounds carved by the slicing bronzeinto the body of menoetius ' noble son
i will wrinkle fine skin on your supple limbs ,
who knew all there was to know about great exploits
all through cephallenia , to every city
to many others here in sunny ithaca
when they returned , thanks to the deviousness
once they would enjoyed these contests ,
yet his fond heart thinks it 's all right to claimequality with me , whom all others fear
warlike thrasymedes gave a two-edged sword to the son of tydeus , for he would left his own beside the ships , and a shield as well
my son , it 's good to pay immortal godswhat 's due to them
that in the same age , even among the same people , this passion for a half-musical mode of speech should awaken alongside of the vaulted structure of palestrina harmonics which all medieval christendom had been building up , i can explain to myself only by a cooperating , extra-artistic tendency in the essence of the recitative
back to my native land
meriones , you are a lovely dancer , but if my spear had hit you , your dancing dayswould have ended for all time to come
laid waste that lofty city and how odysseus ,
i sat on them
as long as the men had red wine and bread ,
through mountain fields and grassy valleys
when they did those things
as telemachus ' comrades were approaching land ,
gazing up to heaven , he poured out some wine , then spoke aloud , saying :
there will be in this district good reports
though small , is welcome
for i do not believe , once he comes here ,
his black earth is rich
of his murderous wife
tell me about it , and be frank
fearful , difficult , and fierce—not someone
ares , ares , you bloodstained man-killer , ca not you return to diomedes
after he had killed the son of atreus ,
and keep striking them against the surging sea
he was the fastest runner of all those
not unless you , goddess , would undertake
you are a welcome and respected guest , but to this pointyou have not come by very much
mighty alcinous then said to arete :
on its end hebe tied the cross-piece , lovely gold , then fixed the golden collar straps
with a shining silver cord he lashed that bag
just as before , breaking his heart with tears and groans , full of sorrow , as he looked out on the restless sea and wept
my heart understands them , all the details ,
playing on the shore , and she was with them ,
when i first saw you
father zeus , ruling from mount ida , most glorious , most powerful , and you , too , god of the sun , who sees everything , hears everything , you rivers , earth , you gods below the earth , who punish the dead when men swear false oaths , you gods are witnesses
and his people , trying to save his children
i chose two men , with a third as herald
for a swift ship , and he was happy to oblige
agenor then bound up his hand in a strip of twisted sheep 's wool and made a sling , which his attendant carried for him , his people 's shepherd
do not you see that long-haired achaeanshave built a new wall to protect their ships , dug a ditch around it , and yet have madeno splendid sacrifice to us , the gods ?
me , i don ’ t want to stay here in my hut
either through the influence of narcotic drink , of which all primitive men and peoples speak , or through the powerful coming on of spring , which drives joyfully through all of nature , that dionysian excitement arises
a friend 's persuasion perhaps can do some good
child of zeus , invincible goddess , hear me
or leap up and dance
then she led him on a path
when the two were close , within each other 's range , agamemnon threw and missed—his spear turned aside
but you did come to a kind man 's house
i say to him—do not be afraid of death ,
to provide this stranger with a dinner
and in despair he spoke to his great heart :
i will discuss no plans with him , no actions
the city 's main defense , the best by far
to stay there by the ship and guard it ,
odysseus lay down there
we suspect that the birth of tragedy can not be explained either from the high estimation of the moral intelligence of the masses or from the idea of the spectator without a play
that 's how the leaders and commanders of the myrmidons rushed around brave patroclus ,
now , of course , alongside this single recognition , excessively truthful and brave , stands a profound but delusive image , which first came into the world in the person of socrates , that unshakeable faith that thinking , guided by the idea of causality , might reach into the deepest abyss of being , and that thinking is capable of , not just understanding being , but even correcting it
she bore her husband splendid children—
and dogs , as well
we must look after him , for every stranger ,
silver-footed thetis then said to achilles :
when a man 's in need , they say that shame
odysseus then sat down
to hear the fate of argives and danaans ,
anything more insignificant than man
inside the hut they would butchered a large woolly sheep
in your own home , trojans treated youexceptionally well , did they not ?
saying this , she hurried through the house , heart pounding ,
brought in bread and set it there before me ,
noble theoclymenus then said in reply :
tydeus had a son not much like his father
soon enough you will learn
and spoke to her—his words had wings :
before now , trojans never wished to standconfronting the fierce fighting powerof achaean arms , not even for a moment
i will offer her to you with gold-wrapped horns
it hit democoön , priam 's bastard son , who would come from abydos , where he bred horses for their speed
forty black ships in his flotilla
but now you would be quite happy looking onif ten achaean groups were fighting here with ruthless bronze before your very eyes
divinely raised scamander , it shall beas you request
heroic leitus knocked down phylacus , as he was fleeing
over the waves and carried them to egypt ,
the very best thing for you is totally unreachable : not to have been born , not to exist , to be nothing
they do not control their horses
he took three paces—with the fourth he reached his goal , aegae , where his famous palace had been built of eternal gold and marble deep within the sea
for odysseus will not be away for long
he will not lie , for he is far too wise
once he would made it back , carrying the weapons , as quickly as he could
standing close to him , talthybius spoke
and yearly seasons rolled around once more ,
but apollo did not let him win the glory there
and tell the steward
so we achaean sons fought there nine years ,
on his handsome head he put a fine helmet with nodding horse-hair plumes on top , full of menace
but the gods are still preventing him
who was coming closer , argus wagged his tail
wise penelope then answered him :
i claim that sacred right , my lord , because it was at your tablei first ate demeter 's grain the very dayyou seized me in that well-built orchard
zeus ' bright eyes never onceglanced from that brutal combat , gazing down and thinking in his heart of many different things about how lord patroclus ought to meet his death , wondering whether glorious hector should cut him downwith his bronze in that bitter fighting there over godlike sarpedon and then strip the armour from his shoulders , or whether he should multiply grim misery for still more men
achaeans held firm around menoetius ' son , united by a common spirit , behind a fence of their bronze shields
lame , wrinkled , cross-eyed , they try to follow
many other danaan counselors
in case those men have a head start on us
with this knowledge in mind , we must understand greek tragedy as the dionysian chorus which over and over again constantly discharges itself in an apollonian world of images
looking like artemis or golden aphrodite
so drink your wine
that 's what 's best now
and from this contrast , greek tragedy perished as a work of art
as for you , you both were trembling in your shining limbseven before you looked on any fightor witnessed first-hand war 's destructiveness
that 's how my shipmates , once they saw me , thronged around , weeping—in their hearts it felt as if they they would got back to their native land , the rugged town of ithaca itself ,
no doubt , a man can suffer lossof someone even closer than a friend—a brother born from the same motheror even a son
she found him there , still mourning endlessly
but when priam 's towering city was destroyed
after he would revived and his spirit came once more into his chest , laertes spoke again and said :
he shook his head in silence , making cruel plans deep in his heart
weigh down his heart , just the way my spirit
eurymachus , my father 's journey back to ithaca
as far off shore as a hollow ship can sail in one whole day , when a fine stiff breeze
or did hostile forces on the mainland kill you off , while you were taking cattle
directly to your and your mother 's home ?
old woman , those who have seen the two of us
ordering them to put their oars to work ,
grain-giving earth had raised them up to be
xanthus , why do you prophesy my death ?
and while music thus compels us to see more and more profoundly than usual , and we see the action on the stage as a delicate web , the world of the stage is expanded infinitely and illuminated for our spiritualized eye
to share a goddess ’ bed , if you want her
the girls picked up the clothing from the wagon , carried it in their arms down to the murky water , and trampled it inside the washing trenches ,
but then the son of atreus ' team slowed down and fell behind , reined in deliberately , in case the sure-footed teams somehow collided and overturned their well-sprung chariots in the road , leaving their drivers , for all their eagerness to win , sprawling in the dust
atreus ' son ordered troops to cleanse themselves
inside the shining bronze
at the same time we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age simply means a return to itself of the german spirit , a blessed self-rediscovery after powerful intrusive influences had for a long time compelled it , living as it did in a helpless and unchaste barbarism , to servitude under their form
the greek artist , in particular , in looking back on these divinities , felt a dark sense of reciprocal dependency
then athena , the bright-eyed goddess , answered him :
after many years—that 's how nestor
tydeus was not a man to shirk like this
eurynome spread a cloak on him , once he lay down to rest
at the sight , black night eclipsed her eyes
to hades , so now geranian horseman nestor ,
he stirred odysseus ' heart
if by the ships right now we were namingthe best men for an ambush , where one seesa warrior 's courage most conspicuously , where cowards and brave men truly show themselves—for a coward 's colour always changes , the man ’ s so nervous he just can ’ t sit still , shifting around , resting first on one foot , then another , heart pounding in his chest , his mind preoccupied with thoughts of death , and his teeth keep chattering in his mouth , while a brave man 's colour never changes ,
so although he may be absent ,
he was destroyed by fateand by malicious hera 's anger , too
not like men at all , but giants
once they would piled up the mound , they went back in , gathered together for a splendid feast , all in due order , in priam 's house , king raised by zeus
his noble wife , but not once did he have sex with her , because he wanted to avoid annoying his wife
concealed in mist and clouds , without a fear
was weeping , too , in another spot , once he saw
their beaks jabbing deep inside his guts
but i am completely doomed to misery , for i fathered the best sons in spacious troy , yet i say now not one of them remains
one by one , as the god rained arrows downthroughout the wide achaean army
many of his companions mourned around him
we just sat—wind and helmsman held the course
for a beggar man
but that emphatic tradition speaks here against schegel
from a long way off , if he wanted to
then athena removed the strange cloudy mist and cleared their eyes , so on both sides light streamed in , back to the ships and out towards the battle groups
father zeus , are not you angry with aresfor killing off those warriors ?
all the things you have determined in your mind
will not proceed the way we want it to
so we lay down and slept
falling to his knees , warlike aeneas stayed down , supporting himself with his strong hand on the ground
and then , you fight over me in person with your bronze
grant that i come to the phaeacians
noble penelope then left and went upstairs
she approached the hut , appearing like a woman ,
the architecture of the scene appears as an illuminated picture of a cloud , which the bacchae gaze upon , as they swarm down from the mountain heights , as the majestic setting in the middle of which the image of dionysus is revealed
odysseus grinned at nestor and answered him :
across the waves he raced , just like a cormorant , which hunts for fish down in the perilous gulfs
phaeacia 's best , had walked along to watch the games
she had a huge loom set up in her rooms
to someone else , and with impunity ,
for we both understand what shrewdness means
my neck was broken ,
with lots of men aboard and loaded down
they went straight to splendid menelaus ' palace
while slaughtering the men
great telamonian ajax then answered teucer :
at the end of his drama , euripides once again made use of this same divine truthfulness in order to confirm his hero 's future for the public
he can take whichever one he choosesback home as his wife to peleus ' houseand pay no bridal gift
antilochus , you are driving like an idiot !
and not one of the achaean women
uncontrollably , just like a cauldron
he throws me into pointless bitter fights
and our ships set off , the achaean fleet
when we achaeans loot some well-built trojan town , my prizes never match the ones you get
i would have my fill of troubles
the old man finished speaking
which have come over him—so fate ordains
lord odysseus spoke , then moved across the threshold
he made a stand right there , in front of old nestor 's chariot , calling out to nestor , son of neleus—his words had wings
and a single servant woman , actoris ,
honoured wife of odysseus , laertes ' son ,
their dear wives and children stood up on the walls as a defence , along with those too old to fight
not by himself , for helen and megapenthes
up to now , the two lapiths had been urging well-armed achaeans from inside the rampart to defend their ships
then athena spoke to him :
it would be shameful if we both went backto olympus , to zeus ' bronze-floored home , without a fight
while they went on talking to each other in this way , eurynome and the nurse prepared the bed
and how we did not get him
agamemnon 's prudent speech changed his brother 's mind
but you must listen now to what i say—
the lovely goddess left , and white-armed servants came , chattering as they moved there from their chambers
the dancing rhythms made a powerful sound
after a while , they realized they could not get out
and beg him for his life ?
no matter who it is comes to this house
idomeneus slaughtered phaestus , son of borus , a meonian , who would come from fertile tarne
but as those two men came out into the plain , they did not go unobserved by wide-seeing zeus
there 's no pain in a man 's heart , no grieving ,
not if he would died among his comrades
son of atreus , how can you say such things ?
began to cry aloud , but i was glad
tells stories which are lies
belonging to godlike odysseus
he especially roused the spirit in fierce ajax , son of telamon
he jumped out of his chariot down to the ground holding his weapons
with disgusting clothing on my body
in fact , many women kept watching him
that fears the gods
each onehas sunk itself deep inside a soldier 's flesh , some strong , swift warrior
but diomedes with his ruthless bronze had gone to run down aphrodite—knowing she was not a godwho could do much in battle , not one of those who control men 's wars
our lookouts sat each day on windy heights ,
it would violate all sense of what is right if i assisted or escorted on his way
strong diomedes , son of tydeus , is hurt , as is odysseus , famous for his spear , agamemnon and eurypylus as well , with an arrow in his thigh
up allthose of youwho want to make the effort for this prize
and make things hard for you in days to come
so now , my friend , you too must die
pour libations to the dead around it ,
for from that time on there was nothing mysterious about how ordinary life could appear on stage and what language it would use
who summons and disperses men 's assemblies ,
but you go on ahead
when dawn came up
still , it 's shameful to go home with nothing
tyndareus ' daughter acted differently ,
euanthes ' son , one of apollo 's priests ,
the spear point pushed on through , below the bone , piercing his bladder
although we needed food , we never thought
so hear me out
whatever name i say
but augeias , king of men , kept the horses there in elis
he quickly spoke to ajax , who stood close by
then their father gave me this reply :
goddess with the gleaming eyes , answered telemachus :
vastly inferior to me , someone
when you sail from there , do not leave me behind , unburied , unlamented
i see suitors here
those who have never had the experience of having to see at the same time that they also longed to transcend all seeing will scarcely be able to imagine how definitely and clearly these two processes coexist and are felt at the same time , as one contemplates the tragic myth
i do not think the family of arcesius
the strap across his chest was frightening ,
we gods are always suffering dreadfullyat each other 's hands , when we bring men help
his wife presented helen with some lovely gifts—
as he spoke , black clouds of grief enveloped hector
the cliff 's too smooth , like polished stone
the other is aeneas , proud anchises ' son , that 's his claim
athena sent this shape to lord odysseus ' home ,
but antinous threw a footstool at him
do you wish to see how overbearing agamemnon is ?
worrying if her fine son could avoid being killed , or if those arrogant suitors would slaughter him
more than the others were
once they leaned back and stirred the water with their oars , a calming sleep fell on his eyelids , undisturbed and very sweet , something very similar to death
the night will come when some hateful marriage
the palace of heroic alcinous
and to hear you talk about my mother
my friends , danaan heroes , comrades of ares , let no one lag behind to pick up loot , seeking to reach our ships with all you can
i will go ahead and smooth the horses ' path
with human flesh and washed it down with milk ,
what do you need ?
now you lie disfigured , my heart refuses meat and drink , though both are in this hut , because i miss you so
they washed their hands and feet and went inside the house , back to odysseus
and make a raft , a large one
who followed him , not one was left alive
you yourself must beg him to report the truth
i know himby his shield , the visor on his helmet , and by looking at his horses
will not go unfulfilled—for all of them—
so i will declarewhat , in my view , it 's best for me to say—i do not believe that agamemnon , atreus ' son , or any other argivewill persuade me , for no thanks are givento the man who always fights without restagainst the enemy
wife to polybus , who lived in thebes in egypt ,
he 's just fled from a ship of thesprotians
it 's not so high
until i am finished with this robe , so i
as for the trench they dug , my horses will jump over that with ease
he brought on stormy blasts from every kind of wind , concealing land and sea
any longer from your home , abandoning
to refuse to take your word
you have encountered dying men before ,
through these gates the goddesses lashed on their horses
i will lie down there
a race like me ,
in the district will get angry with me
who took so much upon himself
she was not alone—two attendants went with her
first he armed himself with bronze around his body , and the two servants did the same , putting on
who had no peer
besides , my spiritdid not mean to stay enraged for ever , although i thought i would not end my anger
wise penelope then spoke out in reply :
ereuthalion then stepped forward as their champion , a godlike soldier ,
antinous ' words made them all jump up laughing
jumped up , ran off , and came back to the ships
silver axle boxes revolve on either side
in the hall , and put them in a secret place ,
with many thoughts of death
i will have some horses harnessed for you ,
antilochus was very pleased to get it
i understand things well
she stuffed three goblets in her bosom
my friends , there would be no glory for us if we went back to the hollow ships
nine acres and more
neleus in earlier times used to sit on them ,
my hand let go my spear
beside him lay a woman he would seized from lesbos , fair diomede , one of phorbas ' daughters
it hit the son of priam 's shield , a perfect circle
we should put together very quickly ,
generations of men are like the leaves
archer god apollo 's priest sought out his daughter
for all his clear-voiced talk
her king 's possessions—bronze and gold and iron , all finely crafted work
enough to set an ambush , in the straits
ox-eyed queen hera smiled , and , as she did so , put the garment round her breasts
once he would said this , alcinous led them out , and they followed him
or are you feeling sad for argives as they are being obliteratedamong the hollow ships for all their pride ?
in response to calchas , swift-footed achilles said :
there , waiting for bright dawn , we fell asleep
the dear nurse eurycleia
he said to priam :
all together in the hall
when they would sworn and finished promising ,
just as a bitch stands snarling above her tender pups when she sees anyone
looking in every detail just like mentor
the gods aren ’ t treating you with disrespect
the introduction of the chorus , according to schiller , was the decisive step with which war was declared openly and nobly against naturalism in art
the story of or name those in the common mass , not even with ten tongues , ten mouths , an untiring voice , a heart of bronze , unless the olympian muses , daughters of aegis-bearing zeus , could sing of the men , all those who came to troy
she came to hector in the form of deïphobus , with his tireless voice and shape
you have not hit me
you are a difficult man to deal with , hector , for you do not take advice
some god poured over me
old priam had agreed , promising he would give her to him
just as a great wave crashes from the wide sea onto the planking of a ship , driven by forceful winds whipping up the waves— that 's how trojans , with tremendous shouts , came down ,
whenever i return to ithaca
in that chesthis mind can not be changed
then alcinous again spoke up and said to him :
or from blustering west wind , the ones
the painful agonies of all the argives
whether to stay with me and tend the house , out of respect for what the people say
if he were brave
here the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man
he was the best of all , because he had most men
world , do you have a sense of your creator ?
here was a spirit with alien , even nameless , needs , a memory crammed with questions , experiences , secret places , beside which the name dionysus was written like a question mark
you will fulfill your mission
but come , let 's sort out the best course of action , so we both can drag the corpse and then get backin person to bring joy to our companions
to cherish you the way she cared back then
they drag me by my feet throughout the house
so now i will goto meet hector , killer of the man i loved
and gave me sandals to tie on my feet ,
i chased you away from your own cattle
i thought i was paying alexanderfor his wickedness , but now my swordhas shattered in my fist , while from my handmy spear has flown in vain
sliced right through—with a groan the stag collapsed down in the dust , and its spirit left the beast
and numerous rich flocks belonging to
i would not spare you or your comrades
in the ground there , make rich sacrifice
as pallas athena did supporting him
dionysus , as before , when he fled from lycurgus , king of the edoni , saved himself in the depths of the sea , that is , in the mysterious floods of a secret cult which would gradually overrun the entire world
war does not offer much relief
and did not reach old age in his own home
like some lion , he thinks savage thoughts , a beast which followsonly its own power , its own proud heart , as it goes out against men 's flocks , seekinga feast of cattle—that 's how achillesdestroys compassion
at once , he slung across his shoulder his curved bow , then threw a gray wolf skin on it
keeps making all this trouble for you ?
your famewill reach as far as the shining light of dawn
he knew who i was
so if you win her favour , there 's a hope
both now and in the future , to kill you ,
the entire truth , just as you requested
i will lie down in bed , which has become for me
immortal divine fluid then flowed out , ichor , which circulates only in the blessed gods
after they would done that ,
discussing all the troubles he would endured
let storm winds snatch it , carry it away
just as phaeacian men have more skill than anyone at sailing a fast ship across the sea , so their women have great skill
many men were killed
even those who lived so long ago—
have no use for bow or quiver , but for masts ,
now look at what you have done
the best and loftiest thing which mankind can share is achieved through a crime , and people must now accept the further consequences , namely , the entire flood of suffering and troubles with which the offended divine presences afflict the nobly ambitious human race
even in hector 's chest the heart beat rapidly
he smashed both hinges
so now i will give you answers to those questions
do not hold back your handsin murderous warfare till you have corneredinside the famous walls of troy those mennow in retreat before you
and only with this hope was there a a ray of joy on the face of the fragmented world , torn apart into individuals , just as myth reveals in the picture of the eternal sorrow of sunken demeter , who rejoices again for the first time when someone says to her that she might be able once again to give birth to dionysus
up to her rooms and there wept for odysseus ,
may he carry backbloody spoils from his slaughtered enemy , making his mother 's heart rejoice
i were either as young as you , the son
in our fear , we moved back to the far end of the cave ,
i will take back from here more gold , red bronze , fair women , and gray iron—all i captured
with a good heart , he gives you food and drink ,
my life 's so miserable and empty
the judgment of the two old men , cadmus and tiresias , seems also to be the judgment of the aged poet : the mind of the cleverest individual does not throw away that old folk tradition , that eternally propagating reverence for dionysus ; indeed , where such amazing powers are concerned , it is appropriate at least to demonstrate a diplomatically prudent show of joining in
are willing in your heart to help me
he 's full of anger , more so now than ever
even the god-like plato speaks of the creative capability of poets and how this is not a conscious understanding , but for the most part only ironically , and he draws a comparison with the talent of prophets and dream interpreters , for the poet is not able to write until he has lost his conscious mind and reason no longer resides in him
openly or in secret ?
long before that we should be considering
daughter of icarius , and quickly , too
as long as you had in your hearts some hope
but his ruthless heart
they make sure odysseus stays where nobody can see him—
old phoenix stayed there , to go to sleep , as achilles told him , so that he may go away with himin his ships back to their dear native land , if he wants , for he wo not take him by force
we both seem born
holding a golden staff
penelope found him especially pleasant because of how he talked ,
old man , you should go home and prophesy
but while the artist , in his revelation of the truth , always keeps his enchanted gaze hanging on what still remains hidden after his revelation , theoretical man enjoys and remains satisfied with the covers which have been thrown off and takes his greatest delight in the process of continually successful unveiling , a success which his own power has brought about
no matter how young and strong , no living manwould dare to make the trip to our encampment
i wish to get back home without delay—
you dog—once more you are evading death for now
later , when we would had our fill of food and drink , i began to speak , asking you to come with us
odysseus would hide his head once more and groan
why wo not you yield to the immortal gods ?
then achilles spoke— his words had wings :
i know you care for me , but let me leave the city by myself , go to the achaean ships , then beg him , that ruthless man , that violent monster
they thought peleus ' swift-footed son by his shipshad set aside his anger and made friends again
stand there with hands and feet lashed to the mast
he would left—in case you harmed your lovely skin
standing near them , etoneus carved the meat
glorious hector struck him as he grabbed the corpse—with a rock he hit his head and split the skull completely open inside his heavy helmet
as soon as you see him stretched out to sleep , then you must use all your strength and courage to hold him there for all his desperate moves , as he struggles to escape
from across the hall the suitors yelled :
overcome with weariness and sleep , athena
in a mad fit he committed evil acts
the fattest one which seems to him the best
but in his heart ,
they called out to one another continually , especially geranian nestor , achaea 's guardian
reaching priam 's house , she found him weeping there and mourning
but his eyes stayed firm between his eyelids ,
and sat around the king , seeking justice , throughout the spacious gates of hades ' home
about a prophecy which you , old man ,
but all this lies in the lap of the gods
by contrast , image and idea , under the influence of a truly appropriate music , reach an elevated significance
as thestor fell , his spirit abandoned him
the mortal hercules , zeus ' great-hearted son ,
whether he was overwhelmed by enemies
my heart and mind know well the day is comingwhen sacred ilion will be destroyed , along with priam of the fine ash spear and priam 's people
odysseus , too , looked round the house to check if anyone
you have been ravaging my house , raping women ,
cebriones went with them as third commander
so you two can be happy in your hearts
with his spear right in the groin and drove the bronze
everything you say , old man , is true enough
when i was being beaten down at sea
i have not yet come near
father zeus , have you ever so deludeda high-minded king and stolen his glory ?
so you should go up to your upper room
and did not bring destruction on them all ,
and get back to his native land—he lacks
chios on our left , or take the southern route ,
odysseus , why are you sitting here like this , like someone who ca not speak , eating out your heart , never touching food or drink ?
where are they sleeping ?
as nestor finished , the sun was going down ,
and come up with devious schemes , people say
go to agamemnon 's hut , atreus ' son
some at the millstone ground up yellow grain ,
and you , our guest , should no longer hide
so i will speak plainly
to steal away the spoils i would won at troy ,
even now , in the assembly of immortal gods , she 's always insulting me , accusing me of favouring the trojans in the war
but the response he got was brutal :
as he thought about his options , he thought his best plan was to find aeneas
on sheep fleeces and an untanned ox-hide ,
he begged for mercy , addressing achilles with these winged words :
if i had known
have shown they are the best
you should not exist or ever have been born
he 's turning it around in all directions
just as children rejoice to see life in a father who lies sick ,
now , just in front of egypt there 's an island ,
nevertheless , he describes the essential being of song as follows :
we dragged our boats into the sacred sea ,
there i will pray to you
listen to me , bold suitors , who have been ravaging this home
and gave her all the details her dear son
in everything , you ’ re the most useless argive of them all , because your mind is dull
swift-footed , godlike achilles charged that cloud three times , striking hard each time with his bronze spear
whom he left at home a new-born child ,
it would be hard for me to compensate
then the lovely goddess went back to olympus
but then you , surrendering to your arrogant spirit , shamed our strongest man , honoured by the gods
pull your horses back !
but even so , he did not neglect what menelaus told him
she felt pity for odysseus as he suffered
every one of you , get your spears and shields prepared for action
go home , and there make sacred offerings
the sort of offshore breeze which makes men 's ships race out across the broad back of the sea
in all other matters
he turned the horses to the swift ship by the shore , took out the lovely gifts , the clothing and the gold , which menelaus had given telemachus ,
my father 's house , great-hearted alcinous
these took him away , back to the city , tired out , moaning heavily , blood dripping from his wounded arm
when i am bowed down with a ripe old age ,
now we are offeringseven of the best we have and much more
when he noticed him ,
when the two armies came to one common ground , they smashed into each other—shields , spears , fierce angry men encased in bronze
but he made poseidon want to help danaans , even more so than before
and let no female god , no male one either , seek to thwart my plan
he killed othryoneus , a man from cabesus , who now lived in troy
we two stood in the doorway
perched up in thick foliage of the forest ,
who ruled the people here and who they were
for the feast which you have chanced upon is in his honour
but archer artemis was no help to him then , no more than was his expertise in archery , at which he would been pre-eminent in former times
when he saw danaans coming up with horses , he would approach them , shouting words of encouragement :
the will , the memory of our personal goals , constantly interrupts this calm contemplation of ours , over and over again , but the next beautiful setting , in which pure will-less knowledge presents itself to us , always , once again , releases us from willing
not even in summer or at harvest time
the bright-eyed goddess went there , once she would finished speaking to nausicaa
they had a blue enamel cornice
still in a rage , achilles chased them with his spear , his heart filled with strong and unremitting fury , still eager to win glory
agamemnon , king of men , then answered nestor :
achilles gave a huge cry of grief
and prepared a feast for me , like an ox
no wild animal he chased escaped him
seeing that zeus had sent the bird , men resumed the fight , attacking trojans eagerly , their battle spirits roused
gripping the arrow notch , the ox-gut bowstring , he pulled back , drawing the string right to his nipple , iron arrow head against the bow
how unequal the division of luck and disaster !
dared stand and face up to the enemy
let 's picture for ourselves a generation growing up with this fearlessness in its gaze , with this heroic push into what is monstrous ; let 's picture for ourselves the bold stride of these dragon slayers , the proud audacity with which they turn their backs on all the doctrines of weakness associated with optimism , so that they live with resolution , fully and completely
but in his heart telemachus had recognized
let fire consumeour strategies , men 's plans , our treaties , ratified with wine and handshakes , those things we used to trust
but after the twelfth dawn had come since hector 's death , phoebus apollo spoke out to the immortals :
seized two of my companions in his fist ,
then at close quarters , hectorattacked leitus , son of great-hearted alectryon
he came out only to the scaean gates and to the oak tree
lord agamemnon , son of atreus , king of men , let 's end our discussions nowand not postpone work given by the gods
and the shield slung round my shoulders
as a more welcome guest
until your cunning led you from that cave ,
here we must at once call attention to the common characteristic of these two conceptions in the genesis of opera , namely , that in them the ideal is not felt as unattained or nature as lost
so you just accept whatever trouble he sends each of you
if he did not , this bullying of yours , son of atreus , would be your last
by the time achaeans had rushed through the stakes , as they crossed the ditch , many had died at trojan hands
kissed the fertile ground
a rugged place , not fit for herding horses ,
painting with music is thus in every respect the opposite to the myth creating power of true music
above the mound , his finely fashioned oar
would that i were young , my strength as firm , as it was that dayepeians buried lord amarynceusat bouprasium
once the men had prayed , scattering barley grain , they pulled back the beast 's head , slit its throat , flayed it , sliced thigh bones out and hid them in twin layers of fat , with raw meat on top
once they would put gleaming bronze around their bodies ,
those horses of warrior achilles , descendant of aeacus , are hard to manage or control for any mortal person , except achilles , son of an immortal mother
why start weeping now ?
as they talked like this ,
with a hearty laugh , he then addressed his comrades :
i , too , know well enoughhow to shout out taunting words and insults
who would been compelled to sing before the suitors , kept trying to get away from his own murky fate
you are great atinsults , ajax , but really stupid
we follow along , but only moment by moment
bright helios never gazes down on them ,
then said something like :
in your own house , in case they take over
more than odysseus ever would have got
from her husband , who , in the twentieth year ,
in our own land
it 's true some young men out in a black ship
that 's how fate decrees he will see his friends
sounding a dreadful thunder clap , he loosed his lightning , a dazzling fiery bolt which hit the ground immediately in front of diomedes ' horses
you are a cunning man , with no lack of wit—to consider
the suitors were outside odysseus ' palace ,
beside the breaking surf
so what if the gods , who live forever , made him a spearman ?
and speak the truth—whether you chanced to hear where my son 's living now
succumb to fear too much
and spirit moved back in his heart , he untied
those two allies you mention are excellent
but then from across the room telemachus shouted out a threat :
i lay in wait for him with my companions ,
but we wo not miss him muchif the rest of us get fighting strengthand help each other
if there was ever such a man , to welcome
earthshaker poseidon set in motion
come , let heralds of bronze-clad achaeanssummon all the soldiers to assembly
because she 's so desirable , we wait here ,
but still , though i have undergone so much ,
he had two sons—alcmaeon and amphilocus
we will lack the bravery to match our strength
achilles had brought fifty ships to troy—
where are you running ?
seeking a man-killing poison , something
without that , the delight in tragedy simply can not be explained
in phylacus ' palace , suffering harsh cruelty ,
telemachus , there 's no way we can ride
but come , let 's send out hand-picked mento go with all speed to achilles ' hut , peleus ' son
then lead her off , cheeks ravaged by her grief ,
in your father 's name , for i do not believe
the platonic dialogue was , so to speak , the boat on which the shipwreck of the old poetry , along with all its children , was saved
then the rest of achaea 's sons came running up
he sent me off , since , as it so happened ,
lays painful curses on his future life ,
our ships moved fast—
and then the noble youth rejoined the suitors
now , for instance , she 's just rescued him from certain death
a brother who was killed , not the worst man
the pigs gave out amazing squeals , as they were herded in
that traitor clytaemnestra slaughtered her right there beside me
for odysseus , her dear husband , until sweet sleep , cast by bright-eyed athena , spread across her eyelids
first he killed astynous , and then hypeiron , a shepherd of his people
by rousing violent winds and giant waves ?
using the analogy of a dream we can learn something about this naïve artist
to the leader of the people
then this stranger , once he gets back home ,
where did she find him ?
one scale sank down , the one which held the achaeans ' fate that day— it moved down to the all-sustaining earth , while the trojans ' fate rose up toward wide heaven
the lycians , led by powerful commanders , their kings , were climbing up the parapets like some black whirlwind
does your heart prompt you to fight against mein the hope you will win priam 's royal honoursamong horse-taming trojans ?
everywhere along the wall , along the parapet , men 's blood was spatteredfrom trojans and achaeans
mixed wine in a bowl for them and served it round , coming to each man in his turn
it was easy for me , as he went away , to see that from the back by the markings on his feet and legs
our task here is to battle with our hands
i sailed across the sea
where the dionysian powers rise up as impetuously as we experience them now , apollo , too , must already have descended among us , wrapped in a cloud ; and the next generation will probably behold his most ample beautiful effects
but i would not allow them to lament—
there is no better way
i do not have any choice
as my men came out , i spoke to them and said :
all the achaeans roared out their support :
made by his shipmates as they moved around ,
old man , she already knows
odysseus then spoke to his servants and his son :
he had a herald , older than himself ,
i have come to you and to your husband here ,
troops streamed out , infantry and horses
i was the first to shoot an arrow off
who did they say they were ?
telemachus ' mother sat across from him ,
the weapon did not leave his hand and miss the target
friend , surely it 's all right for me to answer , and my heart is torn
daughter of the old man of the sea ,
then old man nestor , the chariot fighter , began the ritual washing
it really would have been a welcome thing to me and to my son
and came to see the two
pale fear took hold of me
the battle raged , this way and that , across the entire plain , as warriors hurled bronze-tipped spears at one another , between the simoeis and xanthus rivers
then a huge wild boar
along with father zeus , will be enough
from the large amount remaining , took pieces
and dressed me differently , a ragged cloak
already held her brothers in lacedaemon , in their own dear native land
in a foreign land is a worthless fool ,
it was a glancing blow , but the point of the spear sliced quite near the bone
i saw him on an island
indeed , i could recount a longer story—
as if he were a god
i would like to be therefor that sacred feast
gifts of aeolus , brave son of hippotas
treating her as her own daughter , providing toys , whatever she desired
once sacred persephone dispersed those female shadows here and there ,
to protect his house from ruin
or has some other man now married her ?
now the black earth held him
in the middle he placed his poorer troops , to force them to keep fighting on against their will
to my native land , for my heart is keen
for him that will be a worse disaster
anchor the swift ship that brought you here ?
get other soldiers to remain in place
child of zeus , and leader of your people ,
as he said this , achilles took the old man 's wrist on his right hand , in case his heart was fearful
what antinous had thrown did not make him stagger
many of his comrades , the ceteians , were also slaughtered there around him
how could he be contemptuous of his public out of a high respect for his public ?
i know in my mind and heart that day will comewhen holy troy , priam , and his people , fine spearmen , will be annihilated , when high-ruling zeus , son of cronos , who dwells in the sky , angry at their lies , will shake his dark aegis against them all
a savage with no sense of law and justice
son of atreus , and died in my own home
so why should i not bring an evil fortuneon these trojans when they have made me angry ?
i could just sling a beast as large as that
then she starts to grieve ,
so he could wash his hands
phaeacians have no pilots , no steering oar ,
in there , too , are springs which always flow
their lives and spirits , since it 's far better
some of them , like gervinus [ g g gervinus , author of shakespeare , and shakespeare commentaries ] , do not even reach the entrance halls
or go outside and weep
that 's how you , patroclus , rushed at cebriones , in your killing frenzy
to help him with the power i once had
i might lose my temper , abandon you , and hate you just as much as i have loved you
in fact , it 's wine that 's seized your wits , or else your mind
enormous agonies for oedipus ,
and handed out the portions , while megapenthes ,
fresh-washed clothing when they go out dancing
i do not think he will long survive my arrow 's force , if apollo , son of zeus , really was the onewho put it in my heart to leave lycia
and if you claim to be my father ,
around priam 's great city , many men , sons of the immortals , are now fighting
in spite of all modern ideas and the judgments of democratic taste , could the victory of optimism , the developing hegemony of reasonableness , practical and theoretical utilitarianism , as well as democracy itself ( which occurs in the same period ) perhaps be a symptom of failing power , approaching old age , physiological exhaustion , all these factors rather than pessimism ?
all around that misty rock
once they heard his call ,
but there was nowhere i could plant my feet ,
when earthshaker poseidon heard these words , he left and went to scheria , home of the phaeacians
this husband of mine has no sense nowand wo not acquire any in the future
then stick him there
as for us , we are visitors here and come
just as a man sitting on a rocky point hauls up a monstrous fish out of the sea , using a line and bright bronze hook— that 's how patroclus dragged thestor from his chariot , mouth skewered on the shining spear
as offerings to the gods and to prepare
next , in the leaping contest amphialus came out victorious , and then ,
the swineherd went away
menelaus spoke , rousing the heart in warlike ajax , who moved up among those fighting in the front
moving close to him in the form of a young man ,
some spirit deluded me , made me come
so he got home
and sleep is sweet
could never fool me
but do not provoke me too much with your fists ,
if they miss your voice , they may shy or panic , or refuse to charge straight into battle
the whole great house resounded to the steps of men celebrating a good time
he was angry with his father and moved away
which i saw with my own eyes
noble wife of laertes ' son , odysseus ,
to make his voyage dreadful
outside the harbour , there 's a fertile island ,
the attempt , for example , to use the theater as an institution for the moral education of the people , still taken seriously in schiller 's time , is already reckoned among the incredible antiques of a dated type of education
one who adjudicates the many quarrels
once we would ravaged priam 's lofty city ,
between the epic prologue and epilogue lay the lyrical , dramatic present , the essential drama
dear nurse eurycleia then answered her :
my child , what you say is all well and good , but come ,
but if you would seen that , your heart would have felt great pity
in her heart she thought up another trick
meanwhile , these men are feasting on my home
the glorious son of pelegon then said in reply :
they came where wounded fair-haired menelaus lay
in my hut , too , and in my black ship , there 's lots of trojan loot
where the political drives are taken to be absolutely valid , it is just as necessary that a people should go to the path toward the most extreme secularization whose most magnificent but also most terrifying expression may be found in the roman imperium
aeneas slaughtered medon and iasus
the way he used to and avert disaster
no other woman 's heart would be so hard
even if you yourself escape ,
tall and very skilled in making splendid things
nausicaa , how did your mother bear a girl so careless ?
it 's zeus ' fault and fate—those furies , too , who walk in darkness
and then parcel out among themselves
thick fires burned the corpses ceaselessly
but telemachus , who could not yet believe
in these established concepts we already have assembled all the components of a profound and pessimistic world view , together with the mysterious teachings of tragedy : the basic acknowledgement of the unity of all existing things , the idea of individuation as the ultimate foundation of all evil , art as the joyful hope that the spell of individuation is there for us to break , as a premonition of a re-established unity
that brave odysseus has died somewhere
i moored my curving ships in egypt 's river ,
but wandering around some foreign land ?
achilles , interrupting agamemnon , shouted :
as he thought , he did what seemed to him the better option—
his words had wings :
for here there is no reminder of asceticism , spirituality , and duty
for all his devious skills , got tired out ,
his skill in prophecy , apollo 's gift , had led achaean ships to troy
so there was no light coming from the sky
firmly over anticlus ' mouth and held him ,
whose eyes stopped weeping
eat up , god-guided stranger , and enjoy the kind of food we offer
and quickly skim across wide tracts of sea ,
your dear son telemachus
long-haired achaeans gulped a quick meal by their huts
his achaean army he brought here in vain
telemachus did not turn his back for very long
and where , breathless , we once thought we were being extinguished in a convulsive distention of all feelings , and little remained to tie us to our present existence , we now hear and see only the hero wounded to death , yet not dying , with his despairing cry : longing !
whenever they spin their threads of trouble ,
not to arm myself
he set up his massive anvil on its block ,
they went inside the hut and sat down on some chairs
a crude and lawless people
it was huge—twenty-two four-wheeled wagons ,
who first established seven-gated thebes ,
but sthenelus , son of famous capaneus , answered :
a man with every form of excellence ,
they reached the splendid house and found his wife , a gigantic woman , like a mountain peak
once rose-fingered dawn arrived , we dragged up our ship and made it secure
as he continued on his way , he met both men called ajax , arming themselvesamong the hordes of troops , with crowds of men on foot
when alcinous 's fine son heard these words , he moved so he was standing in the middle of the crowd ,
we lowered the masts into the holds and then ,
collecting his reports in ithaca
mesaulius served the bread , a servant
there 's a steep cliff there , a rock facing the sea right in the misty surf , on gortyn 's borders ,
athena spoke , and resourceful lord odysseus
there 's nothing gives one more delight
my lady , have a precious trunk brought here ,
are already sitting beside their oars ,
whenever diomedes stood over some man he would just killed with his sword , crafty odysseus , from behind , would grab his feetand drag the body clear
who did they claim they were ?
beside the restless sea
and have you at the end—my gift to you ,
once etoneus heard , he did what he would been asked
is it a wedding ?
when the suitors notice they have gone missing
pour me out some barley grain
royal telemachus heard him and spoke up ,
for which we came here in our swift black ship
but even there , thanks to my excellence ,
there wind-swift iris stopped the horses , untied themfrom the chariot , and gave them heavenly fodder
but two warriors , thrasymedes and antilochus , well-known men , had not yet learned about the death of lord patroclus
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
his eye must be sun-like , in keeping with his origin
has asked me to do it , and i am willing
wise penelope then gave him her reply :
saying this , hector threw his bright spear at ajax , but missed
does not convince me
that this man came up and taunted you
when you are back in your own land ,
any plants by hand or plough the earth ,
melanthius said this and left them there , as they walked slowly onward
son of atreus , i fear we are being beaten back , forced home , if we are not all going to be destroyed right here , with war and plague killing off achaeans
he placed the lambs in his chariot
i may become some wild beast 's prey , its prize
and euryalus addressed the king and said :
the land grew there
the breastplate kept his body guarded from the spear
has forfeited his journey to achaea ,
to conceal his tears
well , i have got other troubles from the gods ,
that 's why of all the gods , he 's the onemen hate the most
he missed him , but not by much
on this point we base the fact that we can set a poem to music as a song or as a vivid presentation in pantomime or as both in an opera
cloud-gatherer zeus , quite irked , answered poseidon :
do we think we have got people to help outsomewhere behind us or some stronger wallwhich will hold off our men 's destruction ?
there was no man on this earth they honoured ,
and begged him—his words had wings :
and they put out to sea
they might drivetrojans worn out with fighting to the city , far from our ships and huts
he lit a fire and milked his flock , one by one ,
entreat her to inform him where the city was
he threw the rock and did not waste his throw—he hit cebriones , hector 's charioteer , a bastard sonof famous priam , as he held onto the reins
well-decked boats have stowed on board , then moved the ship to the harbour 's outer edge
given the incredibly clear and accurate plastic capability of their eyes , along with their intelligent and open love of colour , one can not go wrong in assuming that ( to the shame all those born later ) their dreams also had a logical causality of lines and circumferences , colours , and groupings , a sequence of scenes rather like their best bas reliefs , whose perfection would justify us , if such a comparison were possible , to describe the dreaming greek man as a homer and homer as a dreaming greek man , in a deeper sense than when modern man , with respect to his dreams , dares to compare himself with shakespeare
would now return and mingle with the suitors
let that dear heart in your chest endure it ,
talking is a man 's concern , every man 's ,
the sharp arrow went in there , kept going , and splattered blood down on the curving metal
mighty agamemnon then answered nestor :
odysseus meets the shades of the dead
they are easy to distinguish , for he lay in the centre of the pyre—the others burned some distance from him on the edges , the humans and the horses
snatches even these away
aeneas , why have you stepped forward , standing here so far in front of all your men ?
the wife of odysseus , who would been away so long
troy , argive ships , how achaeans made it home—
telemachus , together with the swineherd
talthybius , whose voice was like a god 's , was there ,
always roaming down into the city ,
so come—one of you must fetch a heifer
a sound beats in my ear , fast-moving horses ’ hooves
i have come to see if you could give me news
to maintain her wedded husband 's home
around it was a poplar grove , fed by its waters
they gathered in a group on the spacious grounds before the city
daughter of minos , whose mind loved slaughter
diomedes shouted this , then threw the spear , deliberately missing dolon
as he was returning to his native land
for he was keen to challenge our best men
you could see black earth appear
that swineherd eumaeus was going from the farm
there were many flocks , sheep as well as goats ,
from someone else 's goods , and each of them
just as the falcons with hooked talons and curved beaks
that 's what i said
that son , mighty megapenthes , born to a slave ,
and whom apollo and aegis-bearing zeus
then you would suffer death in misery
when , at a lavish feast in honour of the gods ,
once she would said this , she moved down from her shining upper chambers
they are being destroyed by one man 's charging frenzy
fair-haired menelaus then answered peisistratus , saying :
but the heart inside my chest is worried—
to that famous spearman menelaus ,
taller than before and sturdier to the eye
to join the suitors , while i stay outside , or , if you wish , stay here
of all things , you should now sit in the hall
at once he dispersed the mist , scattering the haze
we sailed in , hauled our ship up on the beach ,
once hera spoke , athena dashed off in pursuit , delighted in her heart
i am a daughter of arybas , whose wealth
who goes without a name once he 's been born
but he 's always got some god beside him , to ward off destruction
brought in the mixing bowl of shining silver
when a man like him , with a grief-stricken heart , makes a request ?
telamonian ajax then answered oïlean ajax :
he stored these carefully , and pallas athena ,
i find your actions here astounding
and i will tell you something else—make sure you remember it
here in our home , and also sacrifice
those who ransacked troy
would be here planning for your funeral
could not do a thing to stop him , nor could
the new comedy could now direct its attention to such a prepared and enlightened crowd , for whom euripides became , to some extent , the choir master
of all my shipmates there , eurylochus
all the hardships he went through
with your incessant need for food and drink ,
then he sat down , directly facing furious agamemnon
zeus and athena end the fighting
perimedes and eurylochus , bound me
that we may not despair utterly of the german spirit , must we not conclude that , in some essential manner , even these champions did not penetrate into the core of the hellenic nature , to establish a permanent alliance between german and greek culture ?
and am very much afraid to clasp your knee
my name 's well known—aethon—the younger son ,
ah stranger , i wish what you have just said
with this rock athena struck raging ares in the neck
athena had poured an amazing poise on him , across his shoulders and his head and made him look taller and more powerful , so the phaeacians
oucalegaon and antenor , both prudent men , elder statesmen , sat at the scaean gates , with priam and his entourage—panthous , thymoetes , lampus , clytius , and warlike hicataeon
with the torch of this idea , let 's look at socrates
with this in mind , it is permissible for us to assess euripides as the poet of socratic aesthetics
sitting down there , they talked to one another
he died in the river , at the hand of swift achilles , descended from aeacus
still , he would have been severely mauled
into the broad lap of ocean and go findthe old man of the sea in our father 's house
the strangers brought , and bring the men inside ,
he killed alcathous , dear warrior son of divinely bred aesyetes , anchises ' son-in-law
about those things that well may happen
of all bronze-clad achaeans to get home
the true song is the expression of this entire emotional condition , mixed and divided in this way
but what of achilles ?
we will think about how we can send him off ,
listen to me , you brave suitors
as are his hands , the glances from his eyes ,
when argives looked at him , they felt great joy , while the limbs of all the trojans shook with fear
it 's because of you the sounds of warfarecatch fire round our city
he would have tossed mefrom heaven into the sea , if night , who subdues gods and men , had not saved me
it is just like the relationship of the solemn rhapsodist of the olden times to the younger attitude , whose nature is described in plato 's ion : when i say something sad , my eyes fill with tears
if one were to choose the city 's finest men ,
a great deal of wealth from those egyptians ,
the immortal ones who hold wide heaven
hector seized hold of that ship and would not let go— gripping the ornamental marker on the stern , yelling to his trojans :
they all had a good laugh at him
and then to sparta , to see if i can find
once you know that ,
now i will tell you something—there 's a marker , so clear you can not miss it
have given , more so than to other women ,
and given me possessions of my own ,
shrewd odysseus then answered him and said :
i will start by giving you this golden cup
to cut that primordial and all-powerful dionysian element out of tragedy and to rebuild tragedy as a pure , new , and un-dionysian art , morality , and world view—that has now revealed itself to us very clearly as the tendency of euripides
if so , all his flesh will fester
on the bed he threw some skins from sheep and goats
o father zeus , athena , and apollo ,
this breed of broad-faced cattle has increased
after this , i can endureeverything
so now he would have given eumelus the mare , as achaeans had agreed , but antilochus , great-hearted nestor 's son , stood up to claim his right
a fair and spacious circle
praying to athena and offering sacrifice
poseidon also answered themis ' summons , coming from the sea to join them
and tell all other men to do so , too
with more rope and lashed me even tighter
his words had wings :
there 's nothing i will accept , despite my need
by father zeus , athena , and apollo , i wish such spirit would fill each man 's chest
you must fix the rope at both its ends onto the mast
resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
they tightened forestays , and then hoisted a white sail on twisted ox-hide ropes
to go through hellas and middle argos ,
and he 's made this threat—which he intends to carry out—he will maimyour swift horses in their traces , throw you bothout of the chariot , smash it in pieces
and then to pay no attention ,
the lovely goddess answered me at once
but hurry to the light as quickly as you can
made them a curse against the argives ,
to a roof-beam high above her head and died ,
but a prudent man , one to whom people have given their trust , who has so many things to think about , should not sleep all night
then shrewd odysseus stripped off his rags , grabbed up the bow and quiver full of arrows , and sprang
for all their arrogance
then came the men on foot in their thousands
these poor people naturally do not have any sense of how deathly and ghost-like this very health of theirs sounds , when the glowing life of the dionysian throng roars past them under the magic of the dionysian , not only does the bond between man and man lock itself in place once more , but also nature itself , most alienated , most hostile or subjugated , rejoices again in her festival of reconciliation with her prodigal son , man
wise penelope had thought of something else—
are all so sensible and thoughtful
he spoke up , asking me some questions :
flames will burntwelve noble sons of great-hearted trojans , all cremated with you
first , eumaeus slung his sharp sword from his shoulder and wrapped a really thick cloak all around him , to keep out the wind
i would never noticed such a lovely tree
where do i stop ?
of all the kings zeus cherishes , it ’ s youi hate the most
a herald gave a splendid lyre to phemius ,
among men who are you ?
o nestor , son of neleus , great glory of achaeans
in appearance you do not seem to be a slave ,
strange lady , why urge me so eagerly to tell you ?
so much so that all the neighbouring men
did not turn out the way the suitors wished
to see the swineherd , the man who tends your pigs
the insolence of those presumptuous men
i do not think that spear flew in vain from the strong hand of panthous ' valiant son
bright-eyed goddess athena answered him :
cloud-gatherer zeus then answered her :
then lost his hollow ships , with all men dead
has come about—an escort and these gifts ,
as they lamented , the son of cronos saw them
they were keen to slaughter me
send us on againto where thracians sleep and to those horses
she would climbed up pergamus
there are two cities there , with all the land
then chryses arrivedat the swift ships of bronze-armed achaeans
thought of something else
the daughter of icarius woke from her sleep ,
i will swim for it
but thoas , in times past , you were a man who always stood his groundand encouraged other men to do the same , if you saw someone shirking
he now lies by his curved sea-worthy ships , angry at agamemnon , his people 's shepherd
inside the palace , you will first greet the queen
to use some of the abundant food they stored
father zeus , are not you incensed at this barbarity ?
his spirit left his body with each gasp he took
in the morning , some of us dragged our ships
telemachus moved off , going through the hall ,
oh , son of laertes , happy odysseus ,
but i tell you this—and it will happen
the men bathed in the sea , washed off impurities
the best thing i could do would be to find
that 's why my heartcannot concern itself with what you have said , only with killing , blood , men 's dying groans
ajax , son of telamon , achaea 's tower of strength , was the first to break through ranks of trojans , punching out some breathing room for his companions
thus these soldiers went at the fight like a raging fire , as neleus ' horses carried nestor from the fight
achaeans ca not all rule here as kings
he was also sowing troubles for the suitors
when they had cooked the upper cuts of meat
next , achilles moved up to mulius and with his spear struck him on the ear
had given him that name when he was born , but now all young men called him irus , because he ran around carrying messages for anyone who asked him
so odysseus went to sleep there , and the young men slept around him
then he set the head rolling through the crowd , like some round stone
you have come , telemachus , you sweet light
around them , people were overwhelmed with wailing and laments throughout the city
everything going on here is my concern ,
he told how he next came to telepylos where the laestrygonians live ,
to whoever he desires
outside the harbour , right against the land ,
he went inside the spacious cave
when encircled by a crowd of crafty hunters ,
they cut these skillfully , pierced the meat with spits , roasted them with care , and passed around the portions
at that moment , as he watched , hector began to shake in fear
as the two groups moved out to the same spot , they crashed together , smashing shields and spears , the battle frenzy of bronze-armed warriors
attached to it with a slender cord , he placed a quivering dove with the cord tied to its foot
oh stranger , i wish what you have said might come about
on a bright shining chair
to protect her great house for her ?
but if sarpedon 's dear to you , if your heart feels pity for him , then let him be killed in a fierce combat at patroclus ' hands , son of menoetius
but then , leiodes ran out , grabbed odysseus ' knees ,
meanwhile the suitors were being driven into action by agelaus ,
are not like you
to find some places we could use as lookouts
while he was having a good time , tucked away
but i will be your guide—even all the way to famous argos—attending to your every need on a swift shipor else on foot
friends , there 's no way an older man weighed down with grief can fight a younger man
the god soon gave us our heart 's fill of game—
the winnowing shovel is a device for separating grain from chaff
it may take them far past euboea
listen to yourself , my pessimistic gentleman and worshipper of art , listen with open ears to a single selected passage from your book , to that not ineloquent passage about the dragon killer , who may sound like an awkward pied piper to those with young ears and hearts
he would left these well-balanced ships at percote , then come on foot to ilion
that 's how strong diomedes went to fight the trojans in his angry fury
father of us all and son of cronos ,
and we endured countless other hardships
we should not make this mattersomething you and i later squabble over , a source of major disagreements
i gave him a fine welcome
two swift-footed hunting dogs accompanied him
make sure you greet nestor for me ,
to great zeus ' daughter , and quickly lifting up
when they had made the oath
a man skilled in shaping horn had worked on them , to fit the horns together to create a bow
since we first drove them back to ilion , i have not stopped fighting as hard as i know how , cutting men down with my bow and killing them
then swift-footed achilles spoke to priam , in a joking tone :
my spirit is not resolute
all people gazed at him
i wished to hold the shade of my dead mother
dragged through this lovely home
for i do not think
my heart was firm
i can fetch some sweet wine for you , so you can start by pouring a libationto father zeus and other deathless gods
peiraeus was the first to speak :
who live forever , take your vengeance now
odius pitched forward with a thud , his armour rattling round him as he fell
a child of dolius , but penelope had raised her ,
i made it back
standing up among the argives , achilles said :
while the two lapiths were stripping shining armour from the dead , young troops with polydamas and hector , the most numerous and bravest of the men , the ones most keen to breach the wall and burn the ships ,
really troubled him and made him old
if i stay right here
eurynomus , was with the suitors
odysseus spoke to them , testing the swineherd ,
you may get back to ithaca , although
once the gods had changed the wind 's direction , it seemed that he could make it safely back
white-armed goddess hera , as soon as she would heard this , spoke to hephaestus , her dear son :
after a pause , old horseman phoenix spoke :
that famous lady hippodameia borepolypoetes to perithous on that very day he took revenge out on those hairy monsters , and beat them from mount pelion towards the aithices
peleus ' son went after him , sure of his speed on foot
achilles , fully armed , climbed up beside him ,
set off to battle , then—show you are a man , the fine man you claimed to be before
molus later gave it to his son meriones
my friend , since you are the first one i have encountered here , my greetings to you , and may you meet me
my friend , leave your arrows and your bow—set them down , since some god has broken themto spite danaans
as a poet , he shows us first a wonderfully complicated legal knot , which the judge , link by link , undoes , in the process destroying himself
when everyone had eaten food and drunk
the boy immediately shrank back against the breast of the finely girdled nurse , crying out in terrorto see his own dear father , scared at the sight of bronze , the horse-hair plume nodding fearfully from his helmet top
what was the immense need out of which such an illuminating group of olympic beings arose ?
and on the eighteenth day some shadowy hills appeared , where the land of the phaeacians , like a shield
onto the close-set timbers , then finished it
some distance from the hearth and quickly turned around towards the darkness
then he advanced—the troops moved up behind him , making a huge din , even from soldiers at the back
fine , large creatures , with thick fleecy coats
on my journey home
just as fig juiceadded quickly to white milk clots it at once ,
with no sense of injury , then strangers
each had thrown his spear and missed , wasting the throw
the lions , after ripping open the great ox 's hide ,
was bringing alector 's daughter home to sparta
then godlike paris stepped out , as trojan champion , on his shoulders a leopard skin
odysseus 's knees gave way , his spirit fell , and in great distress he spoke aloud , addressing his great heart :
i will speak to you quite openly , concealing nothing
stranger , stories told in dreams are difficult—
he lived with us when he arrived from cythera
i would no longer have a chance to get awayfrom death , my fate
he looked like a young man
and drown at sea or just keep going in silence ,
she placed some grains of barley in a basket
for that 's a dead man 's right
hector 's swift-footed horses carried him and his weapons back , leaving behind , against their will , the trojans held up at the trench dug by achaeans
and clothing , too , a greater hoard of goods
but since gods have ordained these evil things , i wish i would been wife to a better man , someone sensitive to others ' insults , with feeling for his many shameful acts
among them all , the father of gods and men was first to speak
but now you are fully grown ,
and having my feet washed brings no delight
yet we were comforted by indications that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss the german spirit still rests and dreams , undestroyed , in glorious health , profundity and dionysian strength , like a knight sunk in slumber ; and from this abyss the dionysian song rises to our ears to let us know that this german knight is still dreaming his primordial dionysian myth in blissfully serious visions
the horses came behind
nestor set horses , chariots , and charioteers in front
in my own home , you will hear
hector was gagging painfully , dazed and vomiting blood
no other beggar or stranger listens in
still wasting his resources
that 's how we held the red-hot pointed stake
all my other fine companions perished there ,
three sons of alcinous stepped out , as well—halius , laodomas ,
then she wrapped around herself a heavenly robe , which athena made for her from silky fabric , adorning it with gorgeous embroidery
the ship 's stern started to catch fire
it 's been three years now—
he were a god
so we asked a god to give us a sign
nothing further here , even though his rage
wise penelope , daughter of icarius , we do not think
with his right hand he grabbed her by the throat , and with the other pulled her closer to him
once odysseus spoke , they all took steady aim ,
then antilochus stripped spoils from mermerus and phalces
came quickly to the island of the sirens
other than achilles no one used it to drink gleaming wine
to one of the other haughty kings—
but they could not string it—whatever strength they had
you have no wish to go into the blacksmith 's home
i , on one side , holding out my sword
and mocked the cyclops :
their numbers now are more than one can count—
approaching him , he spoke—his words had wings :
and now it sat there , covering odysseus ' head
seeking to become your mother 's husband ,
now , if you leave these animals unharmed
they rushed outside and beat their breasts around warlike achilles
but after so many of the finest trojans died , many achaeans , too , though many did survive , in the war 's tenth year , priam 's city was destroyed
only this time the chorus of spectators had to have practice
no man alive on earth could now fight them
in this connection , the chorus of witches [ in goethe 's faust ] says :
within her heart the disastrous folly
once they would been released from their strong chains , both gods jumped up immediately—ares went off to thrace ,
not even from that place
there in the hall , until the sun goes down
here speaks to us only a full , indeed a triumphant , existence , in which everything present is worshipped , no matter whether it is good or evil
youunhappy man , your heart 's had to endure so many evils
he always sat furthest away ,
and tied his feet and hands with heart-wrenching bonds
soldiers from bouprasium , fair elis , those partsbounded by hyrmine , coastal myrsinus , the rock of olene , and alesium—these troops had four commanders , each with ten swift ships
but then he got away from fate and drove the bellowing herd from phylace
i would not advise him to go against you , lord of the dark cloud , but to follow you , wherever you might lead
then she lay back and got some rest , and all her limbs relaxed
then , with sorrowful hearts , they went in person
they unhitched the mules , then brought the clothes inside
my friends , consider both sides of this issue
from things no man has seen
this finely crafted mixing bowl
i will arm myself and hand out other armour
whom anyone would pray for as a son
no , let 's quickly end our quarrel , leavingthese mortal men to fight amongst themselves
goddess athena with the gleaming eyes answered him :
you must go first of all to see the swineherd ,
to be allotted ten
and i asked about each one
argives were not driven back to their black ships by ares or by bronze-armed hector
for both of us she kept watch at the doors
but what was i to do ?
the son of cronos cast a thick mist down on their glittering helmets , for zeus had not felt hostile to patroclus in earlier days , when he was alive and comrade to achilles
the first to spot themwas idomeneus , leader of the cretans
will furnish a fast ship for you and come
at that moment , cloud-gatherer zeus spoke to apollo :
i answered him at once :
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered her and said :
those men were sorry for their comrade , but could not help—
so the complete destruction of the suitors
still , castor , son of hylax , the man
with him in mind , zeus addressed the gods :
as you have made to him , praying you might reach
to everyone , and sends out messages
we know well enough how strong you are—invincible
no joy of her
speaking these winged words to her :
we have not had to go without our shareof feasts , either in agamemnon 's hut , atreus ' son , or here , for you have prepareda richly satisfying meal
after the ram had moved
then call your crew
we went to pylos and reached nestor ,
cinched up his sword , closed his fist around a spear , moved close beside his father , right by his seat , and stood there , fully armed with glittering bronze
i will remain like this till sunset ,
nor will i take them lightly
gave them their skills in famous handicrafts
for the godsare terrifying when they reveal themselves
it knocks aside all fine things built by farmers , hard-working men
for he 's just come home
to enjoy our youth and reach together
you know how his appearance in the hall
thanks to hermes the messenger , the one
or any of the servants in this house
as they made their plea to great zeus ' daughter , hector went to the fine house of alexander
we never spent the night on shore , but sailed
we must stride right into the midst of those battles which , as i have just said , are being waged in the loftiest spheres of our present world between the insatiably optimistic desire to know and the artistic need for tragedy
there he found phaeacian counselors and leaders
and then kill him
choice offerings to the gods
and thus stands out among those in assembly
bronze walls extended out beyond the threshold
but these men had not come through unscathed
but he blocked the way to the swift ships for all of them
and for the nymphs
you have made me so worked up
she raced down from the peak of mount olympus ,
to the hollow ships , if one man , well versed
but they stayed silent
in deep thick woods , for he could track a scent
by contrast , the images of the lyric poet are nothing but himself and , as it were , only different objectifications of himself
the old man plunged back in the surging sea
her words had wings
the polished spear point sailed over his right shoulder , then stuck in the ground
to send him out across the sea 's broad back
so we groaned , and stayed there waiting for bright dawn
and ask him questions about everything , both those who are grieving for their ruler ,
as the masses threw themselves at his feet , he nonetheless , with a sublime act of defiance , threw his own individual attitudes in their faces , those same attitudes with which he had conquered the masses
insulting odysseus , to make his comrades laugh
all through the wretched night , with my eye on
another man who , as a host , provides
fathered brave oicles , who then produced
so the two men helped themselves , eating the fine meal prepared and set before them
with these words , penelope raised a sacred cry ,
go call the stranger
so you must care for
the veil the goddess gave him and let the river
some distance off , he prayed to lord apollo , leto 's fair-haired child :
holding him back against his will
he sent me off
i will give in to you freely , though unwillingly
when the great bow was in odysseus ' hands ,
the man is really strong , much more powerful than other men
i promise he will pay you everything ,
in his distress he addressed his own brave heart :
in their swift ships to carry them across
how i wish all of helen 's relatives
then idomeneus struck oenomaus in the stomach , smashing the front plate on his body armour
he would have stayed here
into the wide hellespont , so that men ,
then , with your attendants
but pallas athena stopped it from sinking into any vital organ
honoured him with all their hearts , just as if
then athena , eyes glittering , took her brother , headstrong ares , by the hand , and said to him :
immortal gods have set a proper time
none of the rivers was left out , except oceanus , nor any nymph
in case my comrades , overcome with fear ,
the other warriors , all those who had escaped
you are a passionate woman—why is it
nestor took the well-made shield belonging to his son , horse-taming thrasymedes
alas , unconquerable child of zeus , who bears the aegis , the argives will flee , go back home to their dear native land , cross the wide sea , abandoning helen , an argive woman , leaving in triumphpriam and his trojans
fair-haired menelaus went out after them
wishes to evade his death and lethal fate ,
hector grabbed hold of a seaworthy ship , at the stern , the fine fast boat which brought protesilaus to troy , though it did not take him back to his own native land
but then athena , goddess with the glittering eyes , thought of something else
were driven by those wicked blasts of wind
but euripides was , to some extent , only a mask
seeing that , lord odysseus filled up his cup with wine and proposed a toast :
father zeus , ruling from mount ida , mighty , all-powerful , of these two men , let the one who brought this war to both sides be killed and then go down to hades ' house
father zeus drove his fine-wheeled chariot and horses
he saved my life
as she led them quickly from the city
but for me this is much better , and for him , too , that before we came to blows he backed off , away from my hands , despite his anger
it 's not ordained that you are to die here , killed by some river , which will soon recede , as you will see
for by that stone wall blazing fires broke out everywhere
if i did not do that , then her father
the two of them wo not stand apart for long
who came from your companions , met me , a herald
damastor 's son , by eurynomus , amphimedon ,
right in the vanguard , the typical greek youth , plato , prostrated himself before socrates 's picture with all the fervent adoration of his passionately enthusiastic soul
leaders and counselors of the phaeacians ,
in fact , i am asking you to do it
when goddess athena with her glittering eyessaw argives being slaughtered in the battle frenzy , she rushed down from olympus heights to sacred ilion
destroys them , once our spirit flies from us , from our white bones
tomorrow morning early give him a bath
you will not lack clothes or any other thing
your heart must stay alert , so you do not suffer harm
and killed her wedded husband—among men
let each grown woman get ready a large fire in her home
night came on , bringing storms
but now you must go home
and rub him down with oil , so he will be ready
then he grabbed two heavy bronze-tipped spears
and they agreed with what he would said
i roused my shipmates and ordered them aboard
then i would still agree
you will make us crash !
on a promontory projecting out
rams and billy goats
my father is a wealthy man , owns lots of things—bronze , silver , well-worked iron
on every one i burned fat and thighs of oxen— i was so keen to conquer troy , its well-made walls
had gone to dodona to find out there ,
here we have demonstrated the one possible relationship between poetry and music , word and tone : word , image , and idea look for metaphorical expression in music and experience the power of music
and he was helped by my accursed wife ,
i will go as well to help you , so with all speed
arising from the mixing bowl was sweet ,
you have destroyed our beautiful world with your mighty fist
standing close to menelaus , he spoke to him—
telemachus , it seems one of the women in the house
for then its disciples would have to feel like those people who want to dig a hole straight through the earth , and one among them sees that , even with the greatest lifelong effort , he is in a position to dig through only a really small piece of the immense depths , and that piece will be covered over in front of his very eyes by the work of the person next to him , so that a third person would apparently do well to select a new place for the tunneling efforts he undertakes on his own initiative
poseidon , and to periboea ,
then the lovely goddess
i could see no evidence
pallas athena took up the reins and whip
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
a home , a plot of land , a wedded wife
in his heart he smiled with bitter scorn
they tied me up with tightly twisted rope
while the females , who had not been milked
if i tried , i would be hopeless , a man
and so , stranger , the name of ithaca is even known in troy ,
i do not think you will make it back yourself—
under the direction of their husbands
it was very beautiful , the loveliest object in the world by far
take a year or more to fly back from there
he hurled his load
scattered the achaeans , i never saw you ,
a change in seasons , the new year rolled in ,
there 's no city there
with a scowl , odysseus , that resourceful man , then answered euryalus :
let no one hear odysseus is back home
these they covered in a double layer of fat
so the two moved straight ahead , guarding their shoulders under bull 's hide shields , tanned and tough , with thick bronze hammered out on top
my father , too , the one who sired me
except those times when east or south wind blew
so in answer to noemon ,
but still , even now i think i will push him
in the air among the clouds
about a pilot for your ship
if you bid me choose a companion for myself , how could i reject godlike odysseus , with his heart and daring spirit always eagerfor every challenge ?
such an ill-fated man ever was alive ?
so i wo not exhaust you and your comrades
old man , what you have just said is true and relevant
despite his sorrow , antilochus did not forget his comrade
let 's get agreementfrom all of you to end this matter quickly
but they would built it without sanction from immortal gods—they would made no splendid offering , no sacrifices to the gods , asking them to keeptheir swift ships safe , so the wall soon fell apart
there the graces bathed and then anointed her
mighty diomedes scowled at dolon and said :
setting in her heart the prudent words her son had said
we would better save him
with his fine hands a spacious bed—fallen leaves were all around , enough to cover two or three
a carver lifted platters with all sorts of meat
in this way , the two men conversed with one another
far-seeing zeus steals half the value of a man
he strode ahead and quickly reached the royal palace
there he left him , leaning against the courtyard wall with his stick in his hands
as much as i do—you have brought to an end
cloud-gatherer zeus then answered him and said :
the man who hits it , that quivering dove , can carry offall these double axes
when swift-footed godlike achilles had stripped the corpse , standing among achaeans , he spoke these winged words :
let each of you
soon dawn arrived on her golden throne
well , i will make a start
then went at ctesippus and said :
they will pay you honours like a god
this dishonourable man had a son with much more virtuous qualities— he could run fast and was an excellent fighter , and for his mind among the best in mycenae
saying this , athena grabbed sthenelus ' hand and hauled him from the chariot to the ground
but sweet sleep did not visit zeus , tossing and turning over in his mind some way to honour achilles , by slaughtering many soldiers by the achaean ships
patroclus fell with a crash , and achaea 's army was filled with anguish
with these words , she turned her sure-footed horses back
come now , tell me this—
then patroclus stood in the doorway , like some god
there was no easy way horses pulling chariots with wheels could move across
down a smooth plank , chest first into the sea
it 's their last stand
they drove me to wage this wretched waragainst achaeans
with indomitable courage , as you did
a people who know nothing of the sea ,
geranian horseman nestor then answered telemachus and said :
they will carry you across the tranquil sea ,
leiodes , that speech that passed the barrier of your teeth , what wretched , sorry words !
you argives , are we really going to give the victoryto hector , son of priam—allow himto take our ships and get the glory ?
it was in bloom
so i went in with her ,
or setting anchor stones , or tying up
what sort of artistic style would we have if from this the idea of the spectator we derived , as its essential form , the spectator in himself ( the pure spectator )
do not fear aresor any other immortal deity
has cut that olive tree down at its base
old men now , their fighting days were finished , but they all spoke well
if down in hades men forget their dead , even there i will remember my companion
the fire has breathed on them too many times
the virgins who move solemnly to apollo 's temple with laurel branches in their hands singing a processional song as they go , remain who they are and retain their names as citizens
he looked out at troy , at the achaean ships , at the flashing bronze , at warriors killing , and at warriors being killed
can yet boast they and their ship sailed past her without getting hurt
the building of that wooden horse , the one
but how suddenly the desert of our exhausted culture , just described in such gloomy terms , is changed when it is touched by the dionysian magic !
then iris came as messenger to white-armed helen , taking on the image of her sister-in-law , wife of antenor 's son , fine helicaon
the son of peleus , from the other side ,
if you start to beg your men , or order them , to let you go ,
if he wo not obey my orders and ignores them , he should consider in his mind and heartthis point—no matter how mighty he may be , he ca not stand up to me if i attack him
follow a single line
begging scraps—no need for sword or cauldron
and there is forested mount neriton
of our returning army , no details
crafty odysseus , with a smile , then asked dolon :
eighth came the fair briseis
will sap his strength before he comes of age
about my dear father 's journey home ,
pelias lived in spacious iolcus ,
as much as they could wish , entreating them ,
but pallas athena refused their prayer
let hector see how my hand wields a spear
they set off chasing him with speed
by the ships ' sterns ?
gaea ( or gaia ) is the earth , the child of chaos
mentor , do not let what odysseus says convince you
he glared at him , then , with a scowl , replied—his words had wings :
the soldiers all grew silent
returning from these hortatory tones to the mood befitting contemplation , i repeat that we can learn only from the greeks what such an almost miraculously sudden awakening of tragedy means for the innermost life ground of a people
so the son of peleus spoke , throwing to the ground the sceptre with the golden studs
from the place he took four shields , eight spears , and four bronze helmets with thick horsehair plumes
the most remote of people
athena stirred up the conflict , coming down from heaven , sent by wide-seeing zeus to urge on the danaans
and men say that he 's a mortal , although zeus , cronos ’ son , gives him glory
planting my foot , i pulled my bronze spear
sit down for a meeting , so i can speak
but if you hold back from war , or with your words convince some other manto turn away from battle , you die right then , struck by my spear
at once he spoke out to patroclus , his companion , calling him beside the ship
then leocritus , son of euenor , spoke in reply :
on the other route there are two cliffs
the time has come for me to send you off
for my limbs and feet are no longer firm , my friend
he 's inviting them to fight , not to a dance
among these warriors , as they armed themselves some distance off , menelaus strode—confident , courageous—rousing his troops for war , his heart passionateto avenge helen 's struggles , her cries of pain
his dark blood gushed out , soaking the earth
with sexual desire , and their legs grew weak
he led in priam with the wagon load of priceless gifts
but agamemnon killed him on the ground
i ca not fight youwhen you burn with flames like this
to the fine flowing spring artacia ,
i was going to tell you ,
the swineherd , that outstanding man , then answered him :
you two ajaxes , argive leaders , and you , meriones , let each man bear in mind the kindnesses of poor patroclus , who , when he was alive , knew how to treat every man with care
he brought with him an enormous ransom , carried in his hands the sacred golden staffwith the shawl of archer god apollo
that 's how you are
you arrogant trojans , who ca not get enough of war 's destructive noise , this is the wayyou will go back from these ships of the danaans , who ride fast horses
that women in some strange and far-off land
what then did schopenhauer think about tragedy ?
as he stood there , he cried out
are beautiful—that 's how that unmarried girl
it may be you will find aegisthus is still living there , or else orestes has preceded you
is not far off , as you will quickly learn
he and war-loving menelaus here will fight it out alone between the armiesfor helen and for all her property
next , fierce warrior polypoetes killed astyalus
but his sharp arrow had not killed diomedes , who moved back to stand beside his chariot and horses
shrewd odysseus scowled at them and gave his answer :
who wished to make odysseus her husband
and through his tears he spoke winged words to him :
they themselves then disembarked in the crashing surf , to prepare a meal and mix the gleaming wine
and a powerful spear , as well
it 's more important , too—if i do kill them ,
though he was short and wore cloth armour , among all hellenes and achaeans he excelled in fighting with his spear
i am not concerned so muchabout patroclus ' corpse , which soon enough will be food for trojan dogs and birds , but i fear for my own head , and yours , as well , which may be in danger
through the iron : as mentioned in the note at , the challenge required the
the faint image then answered penelope and said :
and make her happy , by staying in the room
resourceful odysseus scowled and said to her :
so say your prayers to our father , lord poseidon
from another place—she has no respect
for i will make a truthful prophecy
to give great glory to the trojans
i would give you a home
but then , when penelope
you shall accompany the dionysian pageant from india to greece
who noticed and could hear his heavy sighs
so these men worked hard to bring that body from the battle to the hollow ships , in the face of a fierce conflict , like some fire suddenly rushing at a city full of people ,
we saw a high cave , overhung with laurel
even if you descend to the lowest placebeneath the earth and sea , where iapetusand cronos live , where they get no pleasurein any sunlight from hyperion , or any breeze , in the depths of tartarus— even if you went as far away as thatin your wandering , i would still pay no attentionto your displeasure
this is no meal where each man brings his share
but how can i rejoin that conflict ?
will make our hearts united even more
their bronze-tipped spears , in the fighting there around the corpse of peleus 's dead son
in the same shape you saw him go to sleep , then , warrior king , you can relax your grip and let the old man go
much against their will ,
you idiotic stranger , you are a man
might well observe that you are a rich man 's son
in case another man might eat a lotus
then bring them to the house , and be happy
when this voice came , it always sounded a cautionary note
while they kept laughing , the men prepared a meal ,
do not let trojansdestroy achaeans in this way
mother , why begrudge the faithful singer
you are wearing different clothes , your skin has changed
on the basis of this most significant way of understanding all aesthetics , which , taken seriously , marks the first beginning of aesthetics , richard wagner , to confirm its lasting truth , set his stamp , when he established in his beethoven that music must be assessed on aesthetic principles entirely different from those for all fine arts and not at all according to the category of beauty , although an erroneous aesthetics , in the service of a misleading and degenerate art , has become accustomed to the idea of beauty asserting itself in the world of images and to demand from music an effect similar to the effect of plastic arts , namely , the arousal of satisfaction in beautiful forms
blows cold in early morning
to fight a man who acts with violence
of all the female household slaves she was the one who loved him most , for she had nursed him as a child
athena , with apollo of the silver bow , perched in the lofty oak tree sacred to zeus , who bears the aegis , looking like two vultures , set to enjoy the unfolding human action
our boat sailed on its course , but not for long
already in euripides , when his heroes or chorus first start to sing , things get really out of hand
then strain to push it uphill to the top
like a diver , cebriones toppled over , out of the well-made chariot
their bodies looked like swine—but their minds
and on sweet wine
sorted into separate groups , with yearlings ,
he drove the bronze spear straight through the man
we claim we are far better than our fathers
according to the ideas of lucretius , the marvelous divine shapes first appeared to the mind of man in a dream
by their greater numbers , i would rather die ,
you did not pay attention to your fathers ,
but he first discovered evil in himself ,
he mad use of this tragedy as dante made use of vergil , in order to be conducted to the gates of paradise ; while from this point he continued unassisted and passed over from an imitation of the highest greek art-form to a restoration of all things , to an imitation of man 's original art-world
in the same place schopenhauer also described for us the monstrous horror which seizes a man when he suddenly doubts the ways of comprehending illusion , when the sense of a foundation , in any one of its forms , appears to suffer a breakdown
think of going back , to the hollow ships , son of great-hearted tydeus , in case you get driven there in quick retreat , if some other god wakes up the trojans
for all guests and beggars come from zeus ,
a bright stream flows out underneath a cave
the rest are young ,
and circe , too , on aeaea
but i might force you out into the fields
i picked three at a time
a female servant carried in a fine gold jug
the old man trembled , then ordered his attendants to prepare his chariot
with sons who are , in turn , intelligent
then nestor addressed the argives , shouting :
dead men on the hard earth all around him ,
they left melanthius there , tied up and hanging in bonds which would destroy him
just as smoke rises up , reaching spacious heaven , when a city burns from fires set by wrathful gods— that 's how achilles brought the trojans death and danger
instruct athena to go immediatelywhere trojans and achaeans carry ontheir bitter conflict
all the women raised their hands , praying to athena , while theano took that lovely robe and placed it in athena 's lap , the goddess with the lovely hair , then spoke out this prayer to great zeus ' daughter : blessed athena , sacred goddess , defender of our city , break the spear of diomedes
his handsome looks and shape
when helen had stirred in the drug and told them to serve out the wine , she rejoined the conversation and spoke up once again :
wiped with porous sponges soaked in water
raising their hands , each man prayed fervently to all the gods
after him came forward mighty diomedes , son of tydeus , driving those yoked horses from tros ' herd , which he would just taken from aeneas , though apollo had snatched away their owner
in what painful confusion must the cultured class of such a period gaze at the phenomenon which perhaps is to be comprehended analogically only by means of the profoundest principle of the hitherto unintelligible hellenic genius -- the phenomenon of the reawakening of the dionysian spirit and the rebirth of tragedy ?
may these suitors here
he says that you have here with you a man
who shows him hospitality ?
and take my life or a storm wind would come ,
when the two men , standing on each side with their troops , had armed themselves , they strode out to the open space between the trojans and achaeans , staring ferociously
even one whose actions are done well
onboard a well-decked ship and send them off
all sorts of tricks , the way a man will do
in silence : the doorway in question is the entrance to the women 's quarters
that 's what mighty ajax ordered
hector , my heart and my proud spirit prompt meto volunteer to sneak up to those fast ships and find out what i can
courage in his heart , so he might talk about
resourceful odysseus then moved back and replied :
perhaps some wrapping you had for the clothes
now may zeus , loud-thundering mate of hera ,
the people in the palace were all silent ,
he looked after him , surrounding him with love , as if he were his son
in the city instead of in the fields
so some other beggar will be careful to avoid deception
did not please agamemnon in the least ,
not in the least , for this is why you have sailed
son of atreus , this would be your last offence
then sweet sleep released me
twenty of the best
you should sit here for now
it would be impossible for me to tell
for of all towns inhabited by earth 's peoples , under the sun , beneath the heavenly stars , sacred ilion , with priam and his people , expert spearmen , stands dearest in my heart
where are you from ?
under his own roof , he and the suitors
he sat a long time silent
he came along as well ,
feeling pity for them , zeus spoke to athena— his words had wings :
his eyes were full of tears , his mind transfixed with sorrow
in all of ithaca
its roots were crackling in fire
so let us go ,
was not appropriate for suitors in the past
then walked along the shore beside the sea
the force his supple limbs possessed before
you achaeans have often criticizedand spoken ill of me
it landed there beside his feet
and the keeper of the goats , so they could
byyour knees , achilles , i beg you to respect me as a suppliant
they were extremely angry with him ,
earthshaker poseidon broke my ship apart—
of his own household
bulls and rams—and was sitting at a banquet ,
for my companions who remained behind
but i fear them here , where we may experience disaster , because of hector , who leads their charge
herald , why did my son leave ?
we should not move out , in case some men here
when he would gone to the lapiths
great ajax kept on trying to throw his spear at bronze-armed hector
along with forty fig trees
then shrewd telemachus spoke up in reply ,
poseidon sat there , beside the other gods , wrapping a concealing cloudaround their shoulders
so we can make a tasty meal here in the hut
the loud-voiced herald , standing in their midst , spoke out :
for achilles was the better man by far
third leader was diores , son of amarynces
where the shepherd of his people placed his millstones
approaching him , geranian horseman nestor shoved him with his foot , waking him up
before i ever came to ithaca ,
come on , let ’ s see how much gold and silver
the only life it feeds is bleating goats
that 's in your power
let 's give him a large tripod and a cauldron ,
glorious achilles , lie your white bones ,
now evil death is here , right beside me , not somewhere far away
they go to sleep beside their faithful wives ,
zarathustra the dancer , zarathustra the light hearted , who beckons with his wings , a man ready to fly , hailing all birds , prepared and ready , a careless and blessed man
aeneas , leader of the trojans , then replied :
next , she asked noemon , fine son of phronius ,
like a boy and girl chatting by some rock or oak tree , as they flirt with one another
so come on now ,
lying on the ground
you must be offering a sign to someone
whichever way you look , even if you really try , you can not tellfrom what direction we are being attacked
hides a torch underneath black embers , and thus saves a spark of fire , so he wo not need to kindle it
everything was calm and bright around them
they placed the yoke with care across the polished pole at its front end , then set the rope 's eye on the peg and bound it up securely with three twists round the knob
yes indeed , she still lives in your palace ,
sailing across the wine-dark sea to men
we must not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen -- if society , leavened to the very lowest strata by this kind of culture , gradually begins to tremble with wanton agitations and desires , if the belief in the earthly happiness of all , if the belief in the possibility of such a general intellectual culture changes into the threatening demand for such an alexandrian earthly happiness , into the conjuring up of a euripidean deus ex machina
fair-haired menelaus , very annoyed by what he would heard , replied :
i am a poor wretch , but what i have to say ,
towards the land , and , like a tidal flood ,
anyone like you—either man or woman
the flying bronzegrazed the metal with a rasping sound
he was , as it turned out , searching
troops rallied once more and turned to face achaeans
the envoys approached , lord odysseus in the lead
when he noticed them , he went back inside the house , to tell the shepherd of his people what he would seen
than any other suitor , and now he 's going
your glorious fame , achilles , will endure
no , three times no !
for he has his own sons
they sped off quickly , keen to move on through the city toward the plain
in his rage he may harm achaean troops—passions run high in kings whom zeus supports
the merit you possess , in your anger
dolon 's head rolled in the dust , as he was speaking
once they would quickly covered up the sturdy bed ,
once he finished speaking , noemon went away ,
for those in times to come
so they made their way to the assembly ground
mighty agamemnonspoke to him and said :
he denied me nothing and helped me go
to reach a ripe old age in his own home ,
this herald and the swineherd met because they would both been sent off with the same report to tell the queen
men who destroyed his ships and well-armed comrades , all of them , and how odysseus was the only one
you cruel man , how will any of the countless other men
this is a great disgrace , which people will learn about in years to come—how an achaean force of such quality and size vainly sailed off to fight a lesser force , and failed to get what they set out to take
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
in the mule cart she saw the corpse lying on the bier
in ploughing fallow land
he then spoke out among the suitors :
although you live a long way off , you have heard
but , as the circling years kept moving past me ,
i would not show such grief if he were dead ,
and struck the gray sea with their oars
the fierce gusts of howling winds snapped the mast off in the middle
and nestor 's son was really eager
now i greet you
he gave me splendid gifts—
is that why you are here , you and your devious trickery ?
i do not have a cloak
they can do that—
the others died through their own foolishness
laertes said a prayer
these words of mine won over their proud hearts
for the killing of her son
each one of us
so i wander aimlessly round hades ' homeby its wide gates
then appeared the ghost of my dead mother ,
with those monsters spearing men like fish ,
my ship is berthed some distance from the city ,
you know well enough , divinely bred old man , what he 's like—not someone to take lightly
but what is the origin of this enigmatic trait that the suffering and the fate of the hero , the most painful triumphs , the most agonizing oppositions of motives , in short , the exemplification of this wisdom of silenus , or , to put it aesthetically , that which is ugly and disharmonic , is represented ever anew in such countless forms and with such a distinct preference -- and precisely in the most fruitful and youthful period of a people ?
then he made him leg guards of finely hammered tin
then great telamonian ajax roused the argives :
but if he 's the mani think he is , the fierce son of tydeus , he could not be charging at us in this way without help from some god beside him , an immortal with a covering cloudaround his shoulders , the god who pushed asidethat sharp arrow which struck diomedes
but still i wish ,
even if he lies here an entire year , his flesh will stay just as it is or better
father , now i will bring you
fair winds began to blow behind our dark-prowed ship ,
along with philoetius and eumaeus ,
and honours him , no matter where he goes ,
either they did not come with the contingentfrom lovely lacedaemon , or they sailed here in their seaworthy ships , but have no wish to join men 's battles , fearing the disgrace , the many slurs , which are justly mine
seeing this , agamemnon , king of men , spoke out , rebuking them
my husband and his fine companions there ,
so first of all they bathed and put on tunics
they were some distance from the other people ,
all sorts of treasure , woven goods and gold ,
and then they quickly went back to their dear father 's home
i can reveal the truth of this as well
and caused me pain
then with their talons they attacked each other , clawing head and neck , and flew off on the right , past people 's homes , across the city
i am the only one who can make the claim
behind them , trojans soldiers gave a shout , as they saw achaeans hoisting up the corpse
father , surely one of the eternal gods
a mound , raised a pillar , then planted there ,
but if his heart knows of some prophecythat he 's avoiding , something from zeushis mother 's mentioned to him , then at least let him send you to war , in commandof other myrmidons—it may beyou will prove a saving light to the danaans
i will stay here and bear whatever troubles come ,
though i pitied you before , in my home
to build up walls and planting lofty trees ?
never interact with us
horse-breaking cadmeans were upset with him
pale fear gripped them all
with a phaeacian crew was sailing back
they howled and ran at him , barking furiously
just as a mountain snake waits for some man right by its lair , after eating poison herbs so that a savage anger grips him , as he coils beside his den with a fearful glare— that 's how hector 's dauntless heart would not retreat
the killer of argus , the gods ' great messenger ,
unless , goddess , you ’ ll agree to swear
the day we would seized the sacred citadel
perhaps your husband , the son of cronos , has frightened you ?
just as dogs maintain a tired watch over their sheep in some farm yard , when they hear a savage beast , who 's just moved down from wooded hills , men and dogs raising a din around it , so those dogs get no rest , that 's how sweet sleep had left those sentries ' eyelids , as they kept guard that wretched night , always turning
hector ran under the walls of troy , limbs working feverishly
as for me , may i go down to hades ' home , before i seethis city plundered and destroyed
on the eighteenth we gave you to the fire
achilles spoke—his words had wings
ignoring all the others , hera took the cup of fair-cheeked themis , the first who came running up to meet her
cauldrons , gold , and splendid clothing
hecuba took outone of the gowns , the finest embroidery , the largest
but come , let all of you now swear this solemn oath—
first , he moved around and spurred on lycia 's leading men in every spot to rally round sarpedon
then take it off and throw it far from land into the wine-dark sea
he would drawn out his sharp sword , to see if he would somehow yield the door to him
so every day i would weave at the big loom
i lacked the courage then to fight with you , as you attacked
he 's well disposed to you and loves your son and wise penelope
all the kings applauded horse-taming diomedes
when that spear struck adamas , he doubled up , bent down over the spear , writhing like a bull which farmers in the mountains bind with willow shoots and drag along by force , against the creature 's will
oh , how i wish
warlike meriones , running up , yanked out his spear
she spoke to him once more and said :
zeus no longer turned his radiant eyes toward troy , for in his heart he did not believe a single one of the immortal gods would move to give assistance to the trojans or danaans
he threw on the fire enduring bronze and tin , precious gold and silver
i have placed them well beyond the smoke , since they are no longer
hit him up close
we sacrificed fine beasts to zeus almighty , a bull to poseidon , and one to alpheius
and are lying there , having sex together ,
nor was i killed
seeing paris , hector spoke some sharp words to him :
does not quickly come to stand against you
he stood bewildered , shifted his seven-layered shield onto his back , turned , looked round at throngs of trojans , like some wild beast , then backed off step by step , retreating , but often turning back
then spread out purple covers on these well-fashioned chairs
then nestor , the geranian horseman , cried out :
what sea route brought you here ?
when nausicaa had spoken , they heard her words
my lady , a messenger has come to me from zeus , instructing me to ransom our dear son
you trojans , lycians , and dardanians—soldiers who fight in the killing zone—my friends , be men
they were pleased with what he would said
perse , child of oceanus , was their mother
as its power increases , the subjective fades into complete forgetfulness of self
odius and epistrophus led the halizoni from distant alybe , where men mine silver
huge god hephaestus got up from the anvil blockwith laboured breathing
if that omenwas sent to trojans keen to cross the ditch , a high-flying eagle on our army 's leftholding in its talons a blood-red snake , still living , which it let drop before it reachedits nest , thus failing in its purpose , to bring that snake back for its offspring , then , like that bird , if we , with our great strength , breach the gates and the achaean wall , and if achaeans then retreat , we will come backfrom the ships by this same route in disarray , leaving behind many trojans slaughteredby achaean bronze , as they defend their ships
of the danaans , for men praise the most
diomedes , skilled at war cries , rejoiced
and on it wove a delicate wide fabric
then he left the soldiers there to carry on their strife , their wretched endless war
he carried in his spear and set it in its place , against a looming pillar
what must it have been like with his unapologetic successors ?
in book of the odyssey , when athena visits telemachus in ithaca (
he can make even a brave man fearful , rob him of his victory with ease
that you should leave my home for your fast ship as if you were departing from a man
near the end of his life , euripides himself propounded as emphatically as possible the question about the value and meaning of this tendency in a myth to his contemporaries
they all shouted with him , then drove the horses
so now i meet my fate
just as a storm wind scatters dry straw in a heap , blowing pieces here and there in all directions—
their skin 's not made of stone or iron
to see the day when i return
patroclus is dead , but whoever pulls himto horse-taming trojans here and makes ajax move away—i will give him half the spoils ,
my child , what a speech has slipped the barrier of your teeth !
then she inserted ambrosia and red nectar into patroclus , through his nostrils , so his flesh would stay uncorrupted
we lay there , hearts consumed with sorrow
my spirit 's breath grows faint—the river wind
from which he then emerged at last victorious ,
saying a quick word to odysseus , who was close by :
but if i go back home , my fame will die , though my life will lasta long time—death will not end it quickly
on its right shoulder
now no consolation has any effect
these men competed in the foot race on a course
those threats he would once made against godlike odysseus
but even then zeus had not decided
across the wine-dark sea and then arrive
achilles jumped up in amazement , clapped his hands , and then spoke out in sorrow :
the others will all swear an oath of friendship , a binding one—we will live in fertile troy , they in argos , where horses breed , and in achaea , land of lovely women
i hope i do not get killed or in my palace
just as an angler on a jutting rock
hector , loved by zeus , went in the house , holding his spear , sixteen feet long , bronze point glittering in front of him , a gold band running round it
then ajax gave a nod to phoenix
now 's the time for you to fight on bravely
with savage blows he beat up his own body ,
will no longer be postponed
zeus makes even brave men run away , stealing their victory with ease , or in person rouses men to fight
somehow it must please cronos ' mighty sonthat achaeans perish now without a name , far from argos
and laid them out underneath the portico ,
that 's what i said
but i will be with my horsemen , advising them ,
my spear , for odysseus , sacker of cities , also set me on his knees many times
all of them are trying to court my mother
then i called my comrades , ordering them
who 's been devouring the crop
for he is much more powerful than us
he 's mortal—his fate doomed him long ago
where their splendid weapons lay
dressed his body in these clothes at home ,
zeus thundered and then hurled a lightning flash down on our ship , which shook from stem to stern and filled with sulphurous smoke , as zeus ' bolt
close to the shore , a rock that looks just like
by doing this , is not archilochus ( the first artist called subjective ) essentially a non-artist ?
there 's no snow or heavy storms or even rain , and oceanus sends a steady breeze ,
glancing at his neighbour , one of them would say :
of course , when reasoning can not succeed in this endeavour , myth must finally serve , something which i have just noted as the necessary consequence , indeed , even the purpose of , science
there was a high front courtyard made of stones
until the gods show you a splendid bride
cloud-gatherer zeus then gave poseidon this reply :
his reckless people and was killed himself
saying this , hector gave heart and spirit to each man
hector 's fatal day sank , moving down to hades
carried me ahead and left me on your shore
that 's what he wanted , i suppose
and telemachus can cater to him—
onetor 's son , as he gripped the steering oar
but the gods can not protect a man from death—
i killed a dear son of idomeneus ,
my father will give lots of it to you—an immense ransom—if he once finds out i am at achaean ships and still alive
there they scattered , each man going to his own ship
then asius , son of hyrtacus , groaned in vexation , struck his thigh , and cried out :
it 's hard to compete with children of the mighty son of cronos , even thoughyou are descended from some river
menoetius ' brave son gave it to his companions to carry to the hollow ships
taking aim , bold antilochus speared him in the stomach
he recommended that we consider the chorus to some extent as a sample embodiment of the crowd of onlookers , as the ideal spectator
with strength that never tires , and in a field
but if any man ,
or do they welcome strangers ?
but she wo not have power
this book offers an answer to that question : a knowledgeable person speaks there , the initiate and disciple of his own god
and the day of his return
to come out of the cave ?
son of mermerus , from ephyre
curved ships had carried her from there some years ago , when she would been chosen as a prize for alcinous ,
your son , called me from the room
zeus and helios were angry with him—
while in the middle of the wine-dark sea ,
eager servants carried off their weapons and without delay
son of tydeus , wheel your sure-footed horses round
by what route did they bring you to ithaca ?
aeneas , trojancounselor , now you must defend your brother-in-law , if you feel any grief
telemachus , your wit and understanding
taking that as athena 's gift , she walked away
later on these animals
he quickly seized two men and wolfed them down
a powerful longing to talk face to face
roused from sleep , he saw that where the horses stood was empty , the fearful carnage with men gasping in their death throes
he will forget that pain which now weighs down his spirit
that resourceful man , then answered him and said :
enjoying themselves at his expense
someone else might challenge me or not
a noble gift—for there is nothing better
i do remember all these things you say ,
among them came the two moliones , fully armed , still young , not knowing much of serious warfare
i went down to our swift ship by the shore
the brightest clarity of the image did not suffice us , for this seemed to wish just as much to reveal something as to conceal something
on top , his pointed headsprouted thin , scraggly tufts of hair
murderous ares went in among the trojan ranks , inspiring the troops
their own possessions lie untouched at home ,
with twisted willow shoots , part of the mat
is it all covered in disgusting cobwebs ?
mighty hector 's lethal wave engulfs us
had robbed them of their chance to get back home
then wise penelope replied and said :
this is what 's set for them
she had lain with him on the slopes of ida
with this talent , with all the clarity and agility of his critical thinking , euripides sat in the theatre and struggled to recognize the masterpieces of his great predecessors , as with a painting darkened by age , feature by feature , line by line
always waiting here in hope day after day
send out a call
they kept moving back , once they realized ares was with the trojans
bodies kept rolling underneath his axle ,
to see your father 's and mother 's lofty home and them , as well ?
hector 's got up again , evading death
you can take whichever one you choose back home as your wife to peleus ' house and pay no bridal gift
as a result of all this , we can look upon the world of appearance , or nature , and music as two different expressions of the same thing , which itself is thus the only analogy mediating between the two of them
called out to eurycleia , his dear nurse :
it was to such a concord of nature and the ideal , to an idyllic reality , that the cultured renaissance man let himself be led back by his operatic imitation of greek tragedy
and that 's especially true of ithaca
the old man , afraid , obeyed his words , walked off in silence , along the shore by the tumbling , crashing surf
patroclus threw the offeringsinto the fire
for twenty days the gods detained me there
lady , no human living on boundless earth
icarius ' daughter , is a virtuous woman ,
all of you picked men of the same age ,
they do not extend a friendly welcome
for if zeus , the olympian , does not fulfill them now , later on he will
there 's nothing here—no plant , fig tree , vine ,
were sitting there—by far the best of all the suitors
when you have offered
with her hands she rubbed her cheeks and said :
of caring for a household to which zeus
son of atreus—and along with them ,
they dragged these back , hoping to undermine the wall
cloud-gatherer zeus , smiling at athena , said :
must pay a fine for his adultery
and the troubles they went through , you would grow tired and sail back home well before i would finished
such a belief is possible only in an age which seeks to believe that rousseau 's emile is an artist and imagines it has found in homer an artist like emile raised in the bosom of nature
right to his face :
after all , it 's his home which he came to
i have now come to your knee , to see if you
even the state knows no more powerful unwritten laws than the mythical foundation that guarantees its connection with religion and its growth from mythical notions
telemachus wanted to discuss his absent father
all had a hearty laugh at his expense , relaxing
not even a wheeling hawk ,
go , swift iris , and tell hector this—as long as he sees agamemnon , that shepherd of his people , rampaging at the front , mowing down rows of men , he must restrain himself , tell other troops to fight the enemy in the killing zone
next came the two ajaxes , men clothed in an impetuous ferocity
hector , my child , respect and pity me
a sad end for telemachus right here
quite the reverse , he was moving out to combat , to man-ennobling war
we sailed on further , my crewmen 's spirits
that checked his fighting fury
as the swineherd eumaeus came inside the house ,
a man who could find out these things , return to us unharmed , would be famousamong all men living under heaven , and get rich gifts , as well
consequently , music , when considered as an expression of the world , is universal to the highest degree , something which even has a relationship with the universality of ideas , rather like the way these are related to particular things
men prayed to lord zeus , son of cronos
the struggle , torment , and destruction of appearances we now consider necessary , on account of the excess of countless forms of existence forcefully thrusting themselves into life , and of the exuberant fecundity of the world 's will
she spoke out uttering words of sorrow :
seeing him , mighty agamemnon was elated
and leaders , too , were brushing tears aside , and each man 's legs were trembling—even then my eyes never saw his fair skin grow pale
life left the beast
her words had wings :
the age when youthful charm is at its height
godlike achilles raised his long spear , prepared to strike
i would have given him an argive city
the wound rouses the beast 's strength
they will honour him and give him gifts , as if he were a god
men fought in various groups from one ship to the next
at once they reached the gods ' home , steep olympus
prince telemachus , what do you need that 's brought you all this way on the sea 's broad back to lovely sparta ?
as one who 's been enraged at many people ,
someone might come out from the hall , see us ,
spoke to the animal :
now , we see here a grotesque defect in mythical consciousness , so that socrates can be considered specifically a non-mystic man in whom the logical character has become too massive through excessive use , just like instinctive wisdom in the mystic
and the citizens from the day they meet their doom—
in the boxing match
below chios and past stormy mimas
the first to speak was eurymachus , son of polybus :
back and forth before her loom—she was weaving
with words like this , they came up close and wounded hector
will that wide net of art , whether in the name of religion or of science , fly over existence always more tightly and delicately , or is it determined that it will be ripped to shreds by the restless barbaric impulses and hurly-burly which we now call the present
you never show good news
my child , this warfare is not your business
you yourself obviously understand
this is your guest gift—something to pay back
on top of ossa
he set it down , and with it a shield and helmet
i will tell you one i think is suitable
he wo not remove this wretched plague from the danaans , until we hand back bright-eyed chryseis , give her to her beloved father , freely , without ransom , and offer holy sacrifice at chryse
in a fit of anger , paris shot off a bronze-tipped arrow
it would be far better if he did
would have perished , something not ordained by fate , if bright-eyed athena had not given him advice
their herders are divine ,
both lord odysseus and myself were present
with a murderous peril right beside us
surely you are quite at liberty to plananything you wish
for everything is only a huge sublime chorus of dancing and singing satyrs or of those people who permit themselves to be represented by these satyrs
by a tall pillar , looking at the ground , waiting
the fir beams and high supporting pillars
but in a foreign land away from those
but we have no horses here , no chariot for me to chase him in
the face of her own son or speak to him
but if i came
they threw the bulls ' tongues on the fire and , standing up , poured out their offerings
through this impoverishment the phenomenon itself is even lowered in our feelings , so that now , for example , a battle imitated in this kind of music plays itself feebly out in marches , trumpet calls , and so forth , and our imagination is held back precisely by these superficialities
on that shield hephaestus next set a soft and fallow field , fertile spacious farmland , which had been ploughed three times
you never want to tell me openly what you intend
in the same way , for the man who surrenders himself entirely to the experience of a symphony it appears as if he saw all the possible events of life and the world drawn over into himself
who will escape complete destruction
my home 's being eaten up ,
they quickly left the flowing river , moving briskly forward at a rapid pace
in that chest of yours your mind holds out against my spell
then he led his troops away
wise penelope then answered her :
and thus the onlooker may well stand in real consternation in front of this fantastic excess of life , to ask himself with what magical drink in their bodies these high-spirited men could have enjoyed life so that wherever they look , helen laughs back at them , that ideal image of their own existence , hovering in sweet sensuousness
behind folly , who , because she 's strong and quick , runs far in front of them , appearing all over the world , bringing harm to men
as i hear you talk—these suitors think up
he used to set inside his hall , in a line ,
my proud spirit never gave me any sense
he hit achilles on the shin , below the knee
three hundred and sixty boars were there—four dogs , fierce as wild animals , always lay beside them
lady , what you say is true
powerful hephaestus then untied the netting
hoped we would meet again as host and guest ,
when i kill other women in my home
already in his native land , sitting still
took the bright reins and whip and lashed the mules ahead
crooked-minded cronos ' son made it light for him
across the great sea straight to euboea—
once lord odysseuscame here with war-loving menelaus , as an ambassador in your affairs
i will tell you what the heart in my chest says
what do i care about assisting in this war ?
but for all these things , he 's not been able to check the power of man-killing hector
he leapt into his chariot once more , drove back into the crowd , eluding his black fate
achilles then , in tears , withdrew from his companions , sat by the shore , staring at the wide gray seas
to our swift black ship , bringing a report
the killer of argus ,
the lycians , though brave , did not hold their ground
around these many men , you are far too brash
this said , eumaeus went inside the stately palace , straight into the hall to join the noble suitors
are you supposed to tell the female household slaves of lord odysseus
he begged achaeans , above all atreus ' two sons , the people 's leaders
he needs a sturdy ship
they sit high in the clouds ,
helenus drew back into the group of his companions , escaping death
and many say of him 'he 's a true man
he 's in the bedroom , on the carved-out bed , his beauty and his garments glistening
as soon as you have gone from here , the suitors
she scooped out in the sand some pits to hide in , and then waited there
i could descend beneath this hateful earth
most beautiful by far of all the streams
and it 's skill , too , that makes one charioteergo faster than another
but , my friends , you can repair all this—
suitors of the splendid queen , listen to me ,
the beaten man gets this two-handled cup
thus rescuing all achaeans
even before the haughty suitors come
and , carrying it across my back , returned
but that trouble-making stomach of mine
of female servants in the palace
i will give him seven populous cities , cardamyle , enope , grassy hire , holy pherae , fertile antheia , lovely aepea , and vine-rich pedasus , all near the sea , beside sandy pylos
they quickly followed what i would said
are built in a style utterly unlike
we stood there astounded at what we would seen— a horror desecrating the gods ' sacrifice
for we will not capture troy with its broad streets
with many more as well
but you should know i had no wish to fight
but melanthius the goatherd answered him and said :
in their hollow ships
with passion and had sex with iasion
when i was finished ,
the athenian headland , phoebus apollo
describe for me how you ran into him
held two flaming torches
now the spirits of the storm have snatched him ,
to bring these matters to an end
for twelve mares he would lost and sturdy mules , as well , still on the teat
odysseus spoke , and dolius sat down again
in their theatre , given the way the spectators ' space was built up in terraces , raised up in concentric rings , it was possible for everyone quite literally to look out over the collective cultural world around him and with a complete perspective to imagine himself a member of the chorus
you will be beaten with a torch and leave that way
raise a mound for me by the gray sea shore , memorial to an unfortunate man ,
and met his fate
struck the gray sea with their oar blades
he reached gargaros , site of his grove and temple , fragrant with sacrifice
but then odysseus struck the boar , hitting it
all right , stranger , i will speak candidly
then he leapt in among the ranks , calling each man :
their hands reached out to take the tasty food
when the dear son of odysseus comes ,
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
he carries a huge shieldaround his shoulders
shedding plenty of hot tears , and cut their hair
who sail around , risking their own lives ,
two are married , but three are now young men
lord odysseus never took it
addressing him right to his face :
odysseus and penelope approached with joy
then antinous , eupeithes ’ son , gave him this reply :
you need not worry about my mother
as nestor sat drinking wine , listening to the noise of war , he said to asclepius ' son :
he looks at them precisely and with pleasure , for from these pictures he fashions his interpretation of life ; from these events he rehearses his life
he truly was a gentle father to me
but his sword cut down the son of telephus , brave eurypylus
where waves come crashing with a roar on them
the major criticism which plato made about the old art—that it was the imitation of an illusion and thus belonged to a lower level than the empirical world—must above all not be directed against his new work of art
and provide him clothing
art alone can turn those thoughts of disgust at the horror or absurdity of existence into imaginary constructs , which permit living to continue
and hephaestus have taught all sorts of crafts ,
the heavy bronze-pointed arrow flew awry
he sat down beside the son of cronos , exulting in his glory
considered how he might make such a promise
will separate without some blood being spilled
but there are other kings of the achaeans ,
let 's withdraw , avoiding zeus ' anger
for from all people living on the earth
the chorus of oceanids really believes that they see the titan prometheus in front of them and consider themselves every bit as real as the god of the scene
one held a freshly laundered cloak and tunic
more so than others
clytaemnestra organized a trap for you ,
there was a third leader , god-like euryalus , mecisteus ' son , son of lord talaus
if these last sentences have perhaps managed to give only a preliminary expression to these difficult ideas and are immediately intelligible only to few , i nevertheless may not desist at this point from trying to stimulate my friends to further efforts and must ask them to use a single example of our common experience in order to prepare themselves for a general insight
i told my crew
a good and loyal man , a son-in-law ,
and i am the first born
then addressed the son of nestor :
on my way back there ,
as he said this , he led the long-suffering stranger towards the house
for already i have hit two of their best men , tydeus ' son and the son of atreus
which , i think , will happen—even though
remembering our qualities , the skills
if i try to land ,
is now besotted , loaded down with wine
thus , as patroclus , menoetius ' fine son , looked after wounded eurypylus in his hut , trojans and achaeans kept fighting on in clusters
with sedge , broad-eared white barley , wheat , and rye
recall your warlike poweramong these hollow ships
things would have been much better
it was like a tower made of bronze , with seven layers , each one of ox-hide , a weapon made by tychius , the best of leather workers , who lived in hyle
i wo not deny you or get in your way
my heart was always fearful , just in case
i wishsome comrade would report back quickly to peleus ' son , for i do not think he 's learnedthe dreadful news of his dear comrade 's death
artemis herself had taught him how to shootevery animal raised in the mountain forests
his weapon wounded her slim wrist , piercing the skinabove her hand , right through her godlike robe , a garment the graces had made for her themselves
if for your sake odysseus ever burned
people living in these places own a lot , many sheep and cattle
bronze-armed achaeans talked together , using words like these :
neither side had any thought of ruinous flight
as he looked at him he seemed like the immortals
then shrewd odysseus answered him and said :
like foreign strangers , assuming many shapes
you missed , godlike achilles
but you men , you soldiers , cowardly comrades , disgraceful people ,
divinely born son of laertes , resourceful odysseus—try lifting me , or i will try lifting you
i wo not approachwithin sight of achilles
so if beggars have their gods and furies ,
around the shabby beggars
for that reason , achilles , you should give zeus ' daughters your respect
then she called out to the loyal swineherd , saying :
must like to watch that hateful bunch of suitors
before nestor could finish , the two men arrived
when they lost you , such a tower of strength
the shade of atreus ' son then answered him :
all-conquering sleep then overpowered him
you are not following zeus ' plans
or he may escape , if the son of cronos
where they were born and bred
my heart will never prompt me to do that , for i have learned always to be brave , to fight alongside trojans at the front , striving to win fame for father and myself
they surpass all women for their beauty
let me board your ship—i am a fugitive ,
how my heart pictures him
pulled it from the fire
art saves him , and through art life saves him
the second city was surrounded by two armies , soldiers with glittering weapons
christianity was from the start essentially and thoroughly disgust and weariness with life , which only dressed itself up , only hid itself in , only decorated itself with the belief in an other or better life
or had met his fate
icarius , in his home , where he himself
in an almost alarming manner the culture man was for a long time found only in the form of the scholar : even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from scholarly imitations , and in the main effect , that of rhyme , we still recognize the origin of our poetic form from artificial experiments with a nonindigenous , really scholarly language
the god 's gift had protected him
priam 's city of broad streets was taken
by then i will have completed all our gifts
make sure they lash you there with still more rope
then he untied the horses from their harnesses
to see if he would keep up his kindly welcome
even though your home is far away
get them here fast , while still i have arrows
no one could explain to him why his reflections about and objections to the great masters might be correct
both together , so lord odysseus himself
holy persephone might send at me
even though a strong net tied you down ?
to get back home
in the piles of dung left there by mules and cattle , heaped up before the doors until odysseus ' servants took it as manure for some large field
the god who kept guard over ismarus ,
for some time telemachus
from the plain , the wind carried the sweet-smelling smoke right up to heaven
in his heart nestor 's son
as he had ordered
telemachus then spoke to them with royal authority :
worms are not eating him ,
do not let your hearts fear any ambush , some crafty achaean trick
my trusty comrades summoned me and said :
the loyal swineherd joined the crowd of suitors
achaea 's sons stood up and welcomed them with toastsin golden cups , one after another , asking questions
worthless men could not father sons like you
or is he here pursuing his own business ?
elpenor , how did you come to this place ,
he spoke to the immortals , full of rage :
now , as for yourself ,
brother , you are arming yourself
the leader of the cretans , furious with ajax , then replied :
i have no fight with them
who court me in my halls—the one who offers
achilles ' words at once stirred into action a strong , brave man , well skilled in boxing—epeius , son of panopeus
she said this , then left for the fine palace
or i to him , but in my chest and heart
she said to us :
devising perils for my enemies ,
for anyone who asked him : the name irus is probably a masculine version of iris , the name of the goddess who carries messages for the gods
escorting the large trunk
now they would have mourned till sunset , but achilles soon got up and said to agamemnon :
the hateful marriage , but can not decide
nausicaa went to stand close by her father
the suitors went inside godlike odysseus ' home
for i will give you all the help you need
beside him in the chariot , grabbed the reins ,
hector did not notice ajax , for he was fighting on the far left of the battle , by scamander 's banks , where the slaughter was most fierce
who knows true devotion and has suffered
to every noble she approached she spoke these words :
as medon spoke , penelope felt her heart and knees give way where she was standing
in recompense for this , you angry gods
i was the only one
city of wide streets
honoured wife of odysseus , laertes ' son ,
a sceptre in his hand
he charged at acamas , who did not stay there to confront the charge of noble peneleus , so he then struck ilioneus , son of phorbas , who owned many flocks , a man whom hermes loved above all trojans , and he would made him wealthy
on top he threw a large cloak
richly wrapped in fat , grant this prayer for me—
the whole plain by now was filled with men and horses , all in gleaming bronze
if apollo also stands among them , as a single god next to the others and without any claim to the pre-eminent position , we should not on that account let ourselves be deceived
protect yourselfagainst your enemy inside these walls
is far the dearest of all men to me
but before he said a word , long-robed helen spoke and said these words :
by weeping for your husband any more
troops assembled on the run
and my son is worrying about those men
groping with his hands he picked up the stone ,
as for me , when he 's become a full-grown man
but do not blame mefor golden aphrodite 's lovely gifts
we should save medon , too ,
sometimes to one man and , at other times ,
one man could block the way for everyone ,
sometimes her eyes gazed at him full in the face , but other times she failed to recognize him ,
we who live in troy are men with courage , and there are lots of us
graze wandering herds of goats , eleven in all ,
then resourceful odysseus answered eumaeus with these words :
then forged a net no one could break or loosen ,
the noise from both sides went up into bright zeus ' sky
there is an old saying to the effect that king midas for a long time hunted the wise silenus , the companion of dionysus , in the forests , without catching him
east wind clashed with south wind , while west wind , raging in a storm , smashed into north wind , born in the upper sky ,
and speak the truth—i can see there the shade of my dead mother , sitting near the blood , in silence
they may breed worms in him , defile his corpse , now that the life in him is gone
enjoying themselves—their hearts are cheerful
this said , hector gave ajax a silver-studded sword , along with a scabbard and a well-cut sword belt
when they are worn out with work and lack of sleep
in my own country
for cronos ' sonhas made the rest of the danaans flee
the keen arrow bounded off
now death and fate have overtaken you
but i will go
achilles stood by the stern of his broad-beamed ship , watching the harsh work of battle , the pitiful retreat
if we assume that this desire for the beautiful and the good might be quite true—and pericles , or , rather , thucydides , in the great funeral oration gives us to understand that it is—where must that contradictory desire stem from , which appears earlier than the desire for beauty , namely , the desire for the ugly or the good strong willing of the ancient hellenes for pessimism , for tragic myth , for pictures of everything fearful , angry , enigmatic , destructive , and fateful as the basis of existence ?
swooping down on everyone , destruction in their eyes
would have been eager to rush home to see
to poseidon , dark-haired shaker of the earth
so these men kept conversing with each other
old friend , where does this stranger come from ?
a two-handled jar of gold
a herald led the guests away
resourceful odysseus , laertes ' son
start carrying those corpses outside now ,
an island far away , where they could tend
act with graciousness to us
in astonishment , achilles got up off his chair and stood up quickly , still holding the lyre
so the achaeans stripped sarpedon , pulling the gleaming bronze from off his shoulders
for the two of us , or should i think about
to make a meal of him
the metaphysical joy in the tragic is a translation of the instinctive unconscious dionysian wisdom into the language of the image
rubbed them down with oil , and wrapped around them woolen cloaks and tunics , they came out from the bath and sat down on the chairs
my child , what words escaped the barrier of your teeth !
as he ran off in front of him
he left an only daughter , arete
there with my bronze-tipped spear i struck him
it 's bad when someone does not want to leave
she promised to bring me splendid armourfrom hephaestus
son of the wise anchialus , and king
with ceaseless grief which i can not forget
i called to him—my words
with these words , hephaestus left her there , going to start his bellows
agamemnon struck him with his bronze-tipped spear shaft below his embossed shield , as he was pulling iphidamas out from the crowd
do not stand out there to face him
i am afraid that he 's in trouble
so tell me the truth—this present visit ,
sleep was overjoyed and said :
for i must followthe dictates of a cruel old age these days , though as a warrior i once excelled
schiller has illuminated his own writing process with a psychological observation , inexplicable to him , which nevertheless does not appear dubious
hera , do not hope to understand my every plan
those others over there
from slaughter , not until the suitors pay
for the voyage back to his dear native land ,
as a friend , someone worthy of their pity
you are a man who runs away
he hit acamas , son of eussorus , a strong brave soldier , best of the thracians
but you must go to athena ’ s temple , goddess of battle spoils , with burnt offerings
he went in at once and sat among the suitors ,
the illustrious son of wise polybus ,
strictly charged me to avoid this island ,
then later i can welcome you as guests ,
once hector spoke , he balanced his long-shadowed spear and hurled it
they placed the urn under soft linen in a hut
you shameless bitch , you dare stand against me ?
i have not hit him
but when he left the crowd of men and horses , he went eagerly along the path
to the lovely girl hermione , as beautiful
delighting us in any way his mind
you are so polite , intelligent , and cautious
he went off , leaving the courtyard and the hall , back to his pigs
gazing up to heaven , they uttered words like these :
imagine for a moment the following scenario : if the incalculable sum of all the energy which has been used in pursuit of this world project is spent not in the service of knowledge but on the practical ( ie , egotistical ) aims of individuals and peoples , then in all probability the instinctive delight in living would be so weakened in universal wars of destruction and continuing migrations of people that , with suicide being a common occurrence , the individual , perhaps out of a sense of duty , would have to see death as a final rest and , like the inhabitants of the fiji islands , the son would strangle his parents , the friend would strangle his friend
we rather maintain that the entire opposition , which even schopenhauer uses as a measurement of value to classify art , that opposition of the subjective and the objective , has generally no place in aesthetics , since the subject , the willing individual demanding his own egotistical purposes , can only be thought of as an enemy of art not as its origin
so come , tell me , famous odysseus , great glory of achaeans , does he wishto protect our ships from all-destroying fire , or does he refuse , his mighty spiritstill gripped with anger
eurylochus came back immediately
in order to express that appearance in images , the lyric poet needs all the excitement of passion , from the whispers of affection right to the ravings of lunacy
patroclus slept opposite achilles
then i was young
idaios then returned , going back to sacred ilion
in accordance with these general assumptions and comparisons , let us now approach the greeks , in order to recognize to what degree and to what heights the natural artistic drives had developed in them and how we are in a position to understand more deeply and assess the relationship of the greek artist to his primordial images or , to use aristotle 's expression , his imitation of nature
she agreed to go
they charged out in a frenzy through the house ,
she was in a room inside their lofty home , weaving purple fabric for a double cloak , embroidering flowers on it
heaven echoed with the din
in fact , take away the lives and spirits
odysseus grabbed irus by the foot and dragged him
aphrodite , zeus 's daughter , scorns me
zeus gave you sceptre and laws to rule them
back to our swift ship and cross the water
before the day she married one in public
vultures will gnaw awaytheir tender flesh , while we lead off their wives
far from my own land , abandoning my child ,
the spirit left its bones
are you waitinguntil they fight by the well-built city gates ?
withdrawing some distance from them , he sat apart , exultant , glorious
o father zeus , athena , and apollo— if i only had ten such counselorsamong achaeans , king priam 's citywould soon fall , be taken , sacked at our hands
eurypylus , i ca not staywith you any longer here , though you need help
then the sun set , and darkness covered all the roads
lay waiting for me—i at once removed
patroclus pulled his spear back , dragging thestor out across the chariot rail
all the wives who now control their homes
ajax , noble son of telamon , your people 's leader , everything you say matches what i feel
what curious consideration of the spectator led him to go against the spectator ?
zeus ' daughter aphrodite then took aresand led him off by hand , as he kept groaning— he found it difficult to get his spirit back
tell her she must marry whichever man
i built my bedroom round this olive bush ,
then the women began their wailing , led by white-armed andromache , who held in her arms the head of man-killing hector
famous spearman odysseus came up and made a stand before him
it was in accordance with the laically unmusical crudeness of these views that the combination of music , image , and words was effected in the beginnings of the opera
when coön noticed this , an eminent man , antenor 's eldest son , his eyes darkened with grief for his fallen brother
so she stood there facing up to him
his words had wings :
holding off the suitors in your house
something disgusting and ridiculous—
he came to priam 's splendid palace , with porticos of well-ground stone
their honour comes from zeus the counselor , who loves them
before this point , i was still a foolish child
for second place he led out a mare six years old , unbroken and with a mule foal in her womb
heart full of misgivings
the bronze-tipped arrow hit his right buttock , pushing underneath the bone , going right into the bladder
singing and dancing , man expresses himself as a member of a higher unity
telemachus spoke , and they all bit their lips , astonished that he would spoken out so boldly
then they raised the body off the ground , lifting it high with one great heave
where the steward pours the wine
since our godlike minstrel was first moved to sing , as we were dining , our guest has been in pain—
could see you , more suitors would be feasting
back to your well-built home and native land
we are here as suppliants to you , and zeus protects
he called out to his slaves , and they did what he ordered
from phylace—broad-faced beasts with spiral horns , and hard to manage
achilles spoke and took his seat
how great must dionysus be among you if the god of delos considers such magic necessary to heal your dithyrambic madness !
but wise penelope , icarius ' daughter ,
he 's brought to me a fitting ransom
you were telling lies to make me fear you , so i might forget my strength and courage
until i would asked teiresias my questions
now i beg you ,
stranger , if you wished to sit beside me in these halls
i will tell you where all this is going to lead— that arrogance will soon cost him his life
what about your parents ?
this new soul should have sung , not spoken !
even the noblest moral deeds , the sympathetic emotions , self-sacrifice , heroism and that calmness in the soul ( so difficult to attain ) , which the apollonian greeks called sophrosyne—all these were derived by socrates and his like-minded descendants right up to the present from the dialectic of knowledge and therefore described as teachable
theoclymenus called him aside ,
do not let the pain exhaust you
so , as my guest , i can offer you a gift , something you will like
this likeness you have just noticed , my dear wife ,
when the blameless prophet had drunk dark blood , he said these words to me :
you hold them back with your commands , each one working from his own position
i have no wish to see with my own eyes my dear son fight war-loving menelaus
a gift from dionysus , something made
ares suffered , too , when mighty otusand ephialtes , children of aloëus , tied him up in powerful manacles , then kept him prisoner in a brass jarfor thirteen months
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared , males in the flock trotted off to pasture ,
and carry out as many funeral rites
how i wish odysseus from way back then
as he said this , a massive wave charged at him with tremendous force , swirled round the raft , then from high above crashed down
come on , we ca not fight argives from a distance
we used to spend
homer , the ancient self-absorbed dreamer , the archetype of the naïve apollonian artist , now stares astonished at the passionate head of wild archilochus , the fighting servant of the muses , battered by existence
she saw hector as he was being dragged past before the city , with swift horses pulling him ruthlessly away to the achaeans ' hollow ships
if that 's true , if you are indeed my son odysseus
his limbs dripped sweat , and dust rose from his head
but happiness like that the gods deny me ,
whatever might have been be the basis for this dubious book , it must have been a question of the utmost importance and charm , as well as a deeply personal one
so achaeans got welcome relief in their flight from godlike hector
because we ca not endure what 's happening
epeius made with guidance from athena
if a god does overpower these lordly suitors
brings double benefits—it gives him help
but on that voyage back
wolves and lambsdo not share a common heart—they always sense
a long time simply testing every man ,
to open up or close our well-built trap ,
he threw off his purple cloak
give me some rag to throw around myself ,
when , surrounded by his enemies ,
his flocks bear young
but since those days ,
laertes then answered him and said :
what our country 's called—the phaeacians
he 's hard by the land of the phaeacians ,
friends , if we are all fated to be killed togetherby this man , let no one leave the battle
and came to find news about my father
compensation on his own , in an amount
a beautiful gold jug and poured some water out
slash them with long swords , until the life is gone
and give me the truth
and there were plenty—had fallen in blood and dust , like fish which , in the meshes of a net , fishermen
in some thick bushes and so rid myself
i will send him off
just as when zeus , husband of fair-haired hera , flashes lightning to announce a massive rain storm , an immense downpour of hail or snow , when fields are sprinkled white , or to foretell some bitter warfare , the gaping jaws of battle—in just that way then the groans reverberated in agamemnon 's chest , deep in his heart , making his whole body tremble
but when i would had enough of shedding tears
for a long time now , they have stayed apart from one another , not sharing love there in the marriage bed , since anger fills their hearts
chest straps on our protective body shieldswill be soaked through with sweat
will keep penned up here inside the hall ,
we stayed inside the cave and waited there ,
look beside you— there 's a great stream there , but he ca not help you
mighty earthshaker poseidon , very angry , answered hera :
hand your comrade the cup of honey wine ,
if you are one of the gods who hold wide heaven ,
she gave my helpless husband her fine care
to wise penelope that you are safe
menelaus , son of atreus , zeus-fostered leader of your people ,
; whereas , music , by contrast , gives the heart of the thing , the innermost core , which comes before all particular shapes
next , the old man burned the pieces on split wood and poured gleaming wine on them
he placed his bellows far from the fire and collected all his work tools , then stored them in a silver chest
one 's pandarus , the skillful archer , who boasts he 's lycaon 's son
so you should give a bigger piece of bread
for myth must be vividly felt as a single instance of universality and truth staring into the infinite
helmets and bossed shields rang out as they were hit with rocks the size of millstones
then he hit him with his massive sword , taking his life
then cebriones noticed trojans were being driven back
agamemnon spoke , sending his brother off with detailed orders
she stirred them onto endless lamentation
and govern in this land , and i myself
moving off toward erebus , to join
you claim to be a prophet with these men ,
idomeneus , leader of the cretans , answered meriones :
was the only one who promised he would try ,
aboard the ship with him
but i did not seehis face , for the horses passed me quicklyin their haste to gallop on
then she made her whiter than fresh-cut ivory
with her right she grabbed the bow , snatching it and its quiver off her shoulders
but where invincible talents fought against the socratic instructions , his power , together with the force of his immense personality , was always still strong enough to force poetry itself into new attitudes , unknown up until then
but warlike diomedes was the main commander
for suddenly in his heart he was afraid that , when she touched him , she might see a scar he had , and then the truth would be revealed
without your consent i would never board a raft ,
now , those allies—are they intermingledwith horse-taming trojans where they sleepor separate from them ?
father zeus will make one group victorious
blood soaked the chariot rails , thrown up in gouts from horses ' hooves and wheel rims
where 's your mind gone , that wisdom you once had , for which in earlier days you were well knownamong your subjects and with strangers , too ?
on both sides there were steep banks along its length , with many large sharp stakes driven in the upper edge , set there by achaea 's sons as a protection against their enemies
before you get back to your native land ,
with tears streaming down , penelope addressed the famous singer :
now we are matched by hector , just one man , who will quickly set our ships alight with fire
a greater worry in my heart that you ,
in fearful battles he killed many men
you do not need to suffer what comes from wandering on the restless sea
they were astonished telemachus had talked to them so forcefully
once the sun had set
but the blessed gods were not willingto accept it , for sacred ilion , and priam , and priam 's people , rich in sheep , did not please them
after moving around in many lands ,
with his spear , he hit thymbraeusin his left nipple , tossing him from his chariot to the ground
is so against all human law
cur that he is , he does not dare confront me face to face
i ran away to her , and zeus held back , though still enraged , not wishing to offend swift night
they sent a messenger to tell the woman
just as a skillful workman sets a layer of gold
the way i used to have , or if my travels
their talk is crude , and that i would avoid , in case someone
when he would sailed off in his ships , odysseus had made mentor steward of his household , charging them to follow what the old man ordered and telling mentor to keep all property secure
these men in their armour were fighting at the head of those brave phthians , standing with boeotians to defend the ships
have brought me other grievous troubles
to lead their ships to troy
both her eyes were full of tears , and she would lost her voice
sweet sleep rushed to the achaean ships , to inform poseidon , the encircler and shaker of the earth
if you say so , old friend
opposing him , hector leapt from his chariot down to the ground
he was dealing with his grief
what are you doing just standing here , like dazed fawns exhausted after runningover a large plain , now motionless , hearts drained of spirit—that 's how you stand , in a trance , not marching up to battle
you love constant strife—war and combat
the dogs and young men were chasing after them
then she went down into the sweet-smelling room which stored their gowns , fine embroidered work of women from sidonia , which godlike paris brought with him from sidon , when he sailed across the broad sea , on that voyage where he carried high-born helen off
a desperate struggle then ensued among the trojans and danaans fighting there
through this gulf of oblivion , the world of everyday reality and the dionysian reality separate from each other
and then let 's charge , go at him all together in a group ,
aiming his shining spear at him , idomeneus threw
what a mess , child of aegis-bearing zeus !
you threaten now to confiscate the prizei worked so hard for , gift from achaea 's sons
hence , with archilochus a new world of poetry begins , something which conflicts very profoundly with the homeric world
if i am fatedto die by the bronze-clad achaeans ' ships , that 's what i wish
perhaps horseman peleuswas not your father , nor thetis your mother—the gray sea delivered you , some tall cliff , for you have an unyielding heart
why are long-haired achaeans once againretreating to their ships , being beaten backacross the plain in terror ?
if he 's alive or dead
who understand things well
the dionysian , with its primordial joy experienced even in pain , is the common source of music and tragic myth
if we recall how the dreamer , in the middle of his illusory dream world , calls out to himself , without destroying that world , it is a dream
ilioneus was the only child his mother bore to phorbas
for when gods appear ,
his limbs gave way , as his spirit left him
he died under your powerful hands
beauty and wisdom beyond all women
odysseus did the same—he kissed their heads and hands
he looked around him carefully , as he moved , so no warrior 's bronze would hit his flesh
your request some time agotaught me my lesson , on that very day when hercules , son of almighty zeus , set sail from ilion , after he would sackedthe trojans ' city
and the heifer from the herd
diomedes ' words missed godlike , firm odysseus , who moved off to the achaeans ' hollow ships
to go without—no matter who it is
i have been stranded too long on this island and ca not discover any sign of help
so she locked the doors of that well-furnished hall
who had a lion 's heart and qualities
on my right hand and said :
agamemnon finished speaking and sat back down
pay attention to me so i can say
she fixed a gorgeous golden belt and placed a veil
then serve it to all people in the hall ,
for his mother bore him to go through trouble more than other men
to tell me clearly of your father 's trip ,
year after year—the sub-soil is so rich
pallas athena had a special love for him
but the latter , though an impetuous warrior , did not stand his ground
for those beasts , then i will go down to hades and shine among the dead
this seemed the better choice—to hit him with less force , so achaeans would not look at him too closely
but come now , eat my food , and drink my wine , until you have got back that spirit in your chest you had when you first left your native land of rugged ithaca
as if they are descended from great zeus
come in now , dear boy , so that my heart
to the sounds of celebration
old godlike priam then said to hermes :
he claimed that one day , as a splendid ship
and a boar that breeds with sows , then leave ,
is for his freight—he keeps a greedy eye
helios had stayed on watch and gave him a report
we may either die or ward off death and fate and then escape
and pens no longer hold them , as they run ,
of everything that crawls over the earth ,
taking on the form of enipeus
he met alexander , busy in his room with his fine weapons—shield and body armour—polishing his curving bow
as they lunged at one another in the crowd of men , their bronze chests echoed with the fearful noise
well , when it was the third watch of the night
but they did not understand why this had happened
then , leaning back , one of them would throw it high , towards the shadowy clouds , and then the other ,
which helen had been given by alcandre ,
he begged me many times to let him loose ,
where he used to rest when sweet sleep came to him
just give me a swift ship and twenty rowers—
were you not the one
i am not afraid of war , the din of chariots , but there 's always something more powerful , the mind of zeus , who bears the aegis
but far fewer of them died , for they were careful to protect each other from complete destruction in that fighting crowd
no man could match me , none of the epeians , my own pylians , nor any of the brave aetolians
hobbling up and down his vineyard hills
people call it batieia , but the gods know it as the tomb of agile myrine
then hecuba took her turn in leading their laments :
my son-in-law and daughter , give the boy
nobly born son of laertes , resourceful odysseus , so you now wish
glorious hector then told fiery cebriones to lash the horses on , drive them to battle
if these overbearing suitors kill me
terrified , he started running , leaving the gate
old man nestor shamed them
shedding many tears , stretching out his hands ,
my heart can bear all that ,
he said he had no appetite for food
in early morning , as that sacred day grew stronger , weapons hurled by both sides grimly took their toll— men kept on dying
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
son of atreus , you must maintain with forceyour previous plan to lead the argive troops directly to the harsh demands of war
of all living men , you are the worst—
their best man is leaving
it 's hard for one man to restrain so many
that just how odysseus
with their shameful plans , the suitors brought this on
so i know how many men there are
in a lonely place close to our curved ship ,
confronted with such a public , the nobler natures among the artists counted upon exciting their moral-religious emotions , and the appeal to the moral world-order intervened vicariously where some powerful artistic magic ought to enrapture the genuine listener
one ash spear , weighted down with bronze , fell against the wall
after saying this , swift-footed iris sped away
prudent eurycleia then answered him :
if i can see my goods again , my slaves ,
have the cattle herder drive it to me
ever visit you in future ?
all at once , joy and sorrow gripped her heart
this reconciliation is the most important moment in the history of greek culture
never has desire so filled my mind as now , not even when i first took you awayfrom lovely lacedaemon , sailing off in our sea-worthy ships , or when i lay with you in our lover 's bed on the isle of cranae
go to mount olympus , implore zeus , if ever you in word or deed have pleased him
but i will say this—and what i say will happen—i will break apart the skin and crush the bonesof the man who fights me
into the sturdy hall the entrance to a passage ,
in their black ship
saying this , ares struck athena 's tasseled aegis , that fearful aegis which not even zeus ' lightning can overcome
now he 's met his death , his fate
after you ’ ve been there , proceed to sparta
granting him for all his days continually
and took me with him , until we reached
for i am a man
antilochus , a prudent man , replied :
i am odysseus , son of laertes ,
each time they drank that honey-sweet red wine ,
therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time the primal phenomenon of the tragic can be described with some degree of success
had purchased her with his own wealth—at the time ,
he 's been away so long
can read men 's hearts and thoughts—they know
to lock their room—bolt the close-fitting doors
row on quickly past her ,
then agelaus spoke , calling all the suitors :
we can not begin to sense its highest value until it confronts us , as it did the greeks , as the quintessence of all prophylactic powers of healing , as the mediator that worked among the strongest and in themselves most fatal qualities of the people
beside stern cables of our ship
we came back really angry in our hearts , enraged about those promised wages he would withheld
counselor zeus was waiting to glimpse with his own eyes the blazefrom a burning ship , for that would be the moment he was going to push the trojans from the ships and give the glory to danaans
i am born from axius , the wide-streaming river , whose waters are the loveliest which flow upon this earth
what if i hired you for some distant farm—
he will remember me , as he pours libations
and apollo grants him glory , i will dress him
by the courtyard , skinning goats and singeing pigs
leave your home here on olympus
with a bright veil before her face
his favourite , for whom he 's undergone much sorrow ,
beyond the reach of breathing fire
there she should tryto get the trojans to break their oaths first , by harming the glorious achaeans
to tell each other to our heart 's content
zeus , whose thoughtsendure forever , is calling for you
as you were dying , you did not reach your hand out from the bed , or give me some final words of wisdom ,
a shameful death right here
and other things , your livelihood and mine
do you not seehow they are busy stripping dolops ' armour ?
you can prepare yourself—it wo not be long
the pylian horsemen waited there till dawn while squads of men on foot
and sets them under you , then i will tell you
a quick respite from his exhausting troubles
we went aboard at once , put up the mast ,
did you sail here in ?
turn his hands against those shameless suitors ?
he found her there , a huge fire blazing in her hearth—from far away
her appearance changed to look like dymas ' daughter—
while the thunderclap of the battle of worth was reverberating across europe , the meditative lover of enigmas whose lot it was to father this book sat somewhere in a corner of the alps , extremely reflective and perplexed ( thus simultaneously very distressed and carefree ) and wrote down his thoughts concerning the greeks , the kernel of that odd and difficult book to which this later preface ( or postscript ) should be dedicateda few weeks after that , he found himself under the walls of metz , still not yet free of the question mark which he had set down beside the alleged serenity of the greeks and of greek culture , until , in that month of the deepest tension , as peace was being negotiated in versailles , he finally came to peace with himself and , while slowly recovering from an illness he would brought back home with him from the field , finished composing the birth of tragedy out of the spirit of music
telemachus , now you have reached
the sharp rock struck him on the forehead , bashing in his eyebrows , breaking through the skull
antinous came up laughing at telemachus
i would ask you to consider this—you will spend
but if they are having trouble where they are , with fights breaking out , let mighty ajax , son of telamon , come by himself
i mean , ones now on earth who feed on bread
perhaps , as we speak , odysseus and mighty diomedes are driving sure-footed horses back from trojans
they looked like full-grown pigs , nine years old , standing in front of her
once he would filled his heart with food and drink , he left , returning to his pigs , through the courtyard and the hall full of banqueters , who were enjoying themselves with dance and song , for evening had already come
a mighty oath by all the gods she would tell no one
prothous , son of tenthredon , led the magnetes , from the region round peneus and mount pelion , where leaves are always trembling in the wind
of thesprotians—with many treasures
telemachus had gone to visit the estates
about my master 's painful death
until golden-throned sacred artemis
but you must rouse paris , and he should hurry , so he can catch me here in the city
he collapsed with a crash , and darkness fell upon his eyes
rest idle , not even if he 's come here
i was always fond of ships with oars
and keep nothing hidden , so he can reach
as for you , zeus-fostered menelaus ,
across the broad back of the sea
i was taking gold and silver back with me ,
it has a harbour , too , with good anchorage ,
the mirror in which earlier only great and bold features had been shown now displayed a painful fidelity which conscientiously reflected the unsuccessful features of nature
thanks to my courage—for i was no fool ,
but that did not push odysseus off the pathway
still , i will answer what you ask , the questions you have posed
and it will happen—if he strings the bow
by zeus , highest and most excellent of all gods , it 's not right that water touch my head , until i have laid patroclus on his fire , piled up a burial mound , and shaved my hair , since such grief will never reach my hearta second time , not while i still remainamong the living
at the best of times , he 's a proud man now you have encouraged him to be prouder still
in circe 's house , after i would been sleeping , i did not think of using the long ladder
it 's on the shouldersof hector with the shining helmet—he boasts about it
thus , in council you want us all to thinkyou ’ re better than the rest
or at least as a philologist—even today in this area almost everything is still there for philologists to discover and dig up , above all the issue that there is a problem right here and that the greeks will continue remain , as before , entirely unknown and unknowable as long as we have no answer to the question , what is the dionysian ?
at once he thundered down from glittering olympus , from high beyond the clouds
with an angry frown , wily odysseus then answered her and said :
daughter of great-hearted alcinous , had ordered
how is euripides ' work related with respect to this ideal of apollonian drama ?
but he did not strip his corpse—his heartfelt too much shame for that
a competition featuring those axes
a warm and gentle breeze
the many ships which sailed here with youfrom mycenae stand ready by the sea
each man glanced around , checking how he might escape his own complete destruction
the best of all the argives , voyaged , too ,
that 's what she said , and our proud hearts agreed
have you been hurt ?
came some servants carrying a chest which held
and i do not blame
gods are supposed to give us happiness
now my son lies in the dust , heart filled with pain
the stranger 's strength made him the better man
sent a black cloud above our hollow ship
what young men went with him ?
so i weep all the time
so none of you
then he would get up , to wander in distress , back and forth along the shore
stay here a while
this bowl achilles set out as a prize to honour his companion , a trophy for the man who in the footrace proved he was the fastest
i think it 's clear
acamas shouted this , bringing grief to argives
way over there among the trojans ,
now i will go back and tell this to achilles
the first one to speak was telamonian ajax :
and were asleep , but this one , weaker than the rest , had not yet finished
the day he 's taken and becomes a slave
and it was freezing cold
and put everything in some containers—
she may rescue him from death
and athena gave me strength and courage ,
the child odysseus had , telemachus
churning the water white with polished blades
went to her bright room upstairs and wept there
it can not be described ?
even the virtuous ones
did he take that black ship against your will ,
he charged on , eager to force the argives quickly back , to massacre large numbers of their soldiers
even now , if you would speak to fierce achilles , you might persuade him
he called his nurse , eurycleia , and said to her :
meanwhile , athena , daughter of aegis-bearing zeus , threw her dress down on the floor of her father 's house , a soft robe , richly embroidered , which she would made with her own hands
the way he did
expressions of compassionate condescension may be heard in the most varied camps of the spirit -- and of lack of spirit
and described them to me
and what fate has befallen him
telemachus lay there all night long , wrapped up
a man ca not be well skilled in everything
an endless sleep , so there among the leaves ,
son of atreus , that famous spearman ,
from high up in the roof
tell me , so we will both know
but when i saw that ,
noblemachaon , think about how this battle will end up—the shouting from our young men by the shipsis getting louder
you will not talk me into it
in front the mules drew on the four-wheeled wagon , led by wise idaios
i would suggest you stay away
if you asked me to stay for one whole year ,
then a dog lying there raised its head and pricked up its ears
not once was there a favourable wind ,
be blessed among all men , get everything
there the trojans and dardanians were seated in a meeting , a general assembly , awaiting his return
the sun went down ,
and spoke to his own heart :
me and my father
the woman spoke to them again and said :
she unhinged their minds , so laughter from their mouths came from an alien source , and the meat they ate became blood-spattered
by the muses ' clear-toned song
i have got a shovel used for winnowing
will start their wicked schemes to hurt you later—
as my ship left the beetling cliffs behind ,
and started weaving something very big ,
he who would destroy the opera must take up the struggle against alexandrian cheerfulness , which expresses itself so naïvely in opera concerning its favorite idea
gifts he had received from iphitus , his friend ,
so he had to ask himself : have i always labeled unintelligible things i could not understand ?
aphrodite spoke , stirring emotion in helen 's heart
every day and night zeus sends , they kill
the killer of argus , god 's messenger , stood there , marveling at the sight
hera and athena muttered , sitting together , plotting trouble for the trojans
nausicaa brought her fine clothing from her room
with her she brought
but an evil fate was leading him towards his death , destroyed at your hands , menelaus , in lethal war
pour some sweet wine into jars for me ,
for every day i get my joy from mourning ,
saying this , cebriones urged on their horses with the lovely manes , cracking his whip over them
for i can explain the doric state and doric art only as a constant apollonian war camp
i will remind you of these things once more , so you will stop your malicious trickery , so you will see the advantages you getfrom this seduction , this couch where you layto have sex with me , when you came from the godsintending to deceive me
with more wealth in hand
dionysian art also wants to convince us of the eternal delight in existence
and see it through just as i tell you ?
but of brave odysseus ,
he made that net
idomeneus yanked his long spear out of the corpse
antinous , in our hearts do we truly know or not
but zeus ' mind is always stronger than a man 's
ripped to shreds by the power of that wind
priam stood up , descendant of dardanus , wise as the gods
she made him recall his father , even more so than before
i grabbed its back
to sit now in your home , for there 's a chance
standing near him , athena spoke
but if that 's your wish , if your heart 's set on it , you have that bedroom your own son hephaestushad built for you
old woman , you can rejoice in your own heart—but do not cry out aloud
and serve as his attendant there in troy ,
which forces her to leave
from left to right , beginning from the place
a man who 's done a lot of wandering
then he laughed with triumph , driving the sure-footed horses past the ditch
hector with his gleaming helmet scowled and said : polydamas , i do not like what you have just said
how can you get this cure ?
but then sweet sleep came over me—i was too worn out
and question you , then reassure them ,
for king pheidon said he would welcomed him with entertainments ,
my dear mother , although quite sensible ,
you can not be odysseus , my father
one of the immortal gods
but odysseus did not forget his various tricks
he stole ares secretly
but my warrior spirit did not listen
to my young goats , then he could drink down whey and put some muscle on those thighs of his
then , removing the cover from his quiver , pandarus took out an arrow , a fresh-winged courier bearing dark agony
then odysseus got up and set off for the city
many times you soaked the shirt on my chest , slobbering your wine , a helpless baby
i am willing to give up all of it , even to add to it things of my own
i saw themwheeling round the turning post in front
the poor man 's miserable
since he 's a younger man of my own age ,
but that 's not what they have done
that 's how keen he was to kill the trojans
a sword completely made of bronze ,
among my servants , if some other one
through the former a phenomenon becomes more impoverished than it is , whereas through dionysian music the individual phenomenon becomes richer and widens into an image of the world
to go about their tasks
since you have questioned me , i will tell you the truth
wise telemachus then answered her and said :
a resourceful man , who won himself
the gods pitied odysseus ,
and keep this home with me
irus any more , judging from the thighs
the cattle herder philoetius
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
as you will need to satisfy your wants
for a short time we really are the primordial essence itself and feel its unbridled lust for and joy in existence
after he would told them all his prophecies ,
one you ca not escape
the two approached , came up , and stood there before cloud-gatherer zeus
as i remember them
had returned and come back to his palace
he wo not stop cutting men down with his bronze , for zeus is giving him the glory
son of atreus , indeed i will prove myselfa loyal comrade to you , as i promised that first time long ago
and so , my lad ,
and enjoy each other 's wretched troubles ,
for to us who stand on the boundary line between two different forms of existence , the hellenic prototype retains this immeasurable value , that all these transitions and struggles are imprinted upon it in a classically instructive form ; except that we , as it were , pass through the chief epochs of the hellenic genius , analogically in reverse order , and seem now , for instance , to be passing backward from the alexandrian age to the period of tragedy
some wove fabric , or sitting down , twisted yarn , hands fluttering like leaves on a tall poplar tree , while olive oil dripped down
as if he were a god , and sent him in a ship
listen to me , friends
knows if , before that wedding day arrives ,
she had a young lad at her breast , a child , who now , i think , sits down among the men , happy his dear father will notice him
twenty of the women
when they gulp it down and drink too much
he 's got something he wants to say
he went off to the storeroom
are you going to take me still further off , to some well-populated city somewherein phrygia or beautiful maeonia , because you are in love with some mortal manand menelaus has just beaten parisand wants to take me , a despised woman , back home with him ?
penelope spoke , and the old woman held her hands over her face and shed warm tears
i wo not just tell you odysseus will be back—
how can you claim i am hanging back from battleeach time we achaeans rouse ourselves for waragainst horse-taming trojans ?
when they had sex with them in secret
before he gets back to his native land ,
midway between the earth and starry heaven , zeus reached mount ida with its many springs , mother of wild beasts
for any one of them who injures him
a voice from zeus , which often brings men news
so the two of them reached out to take the fine food
athena , zeus ' daughter , goddess of war 's spoils , was first to stand before you , to ward off the piercing arrow—she brushed it from your skin , just as a mother brushes a fly off her child while he lies sweetly sleeping
he cheated me , betrayed me
he moved out of lord agamemnon 's line of sight , to one side , then struck his forearm with his spear , just below the elbow
out of my arms , like a shadow or a dream
had died , brought to their knees , since she
many enemies are now devising schemes
at once he was helped along by female servants made of gold , who moved to him
without a sign of fear , strong diomedes then replied :
that way we would escape from trouble as quickly as we could
a glancing blow across the wrist
in reading omens from the birds
but with his sword diomedes jumped at him , slashed him across the middle of his neck , slicing through both tendons
if his feet outrun ours , we will keep following himand chase him from his camp towards our ships
they were in such a rush to shift him
where to put this wealth
the sheer rock precipice
his brothers and comrades collected hector 's ash-white bones , as they mourned him— heavy tears running down their cheeks—and placed them in a golden urn , wrapped in soft purple cloth
at least that 's what he was to me
she dressed me in immortal clothing , and sent a wind ,
with socrates as his ally , euripides dared to be the herald of a new artistic creativity
when the wrapped-up thigh bones were completely cooked , and they would tasted samples of the inner organs , they chopped up the rest , arranged the meat on spits , cooked it carefully , then drew it from the fire
with these words , hector roused each man 's fighting spirit
these men are courting me against my will
holding his round shield in front of him , he stepped lightly forward , under cover of that shield
could stretch the string on that powerful bow
simoeis produced ambrosia for them to eat
the famous crippled god then answered thetis :
is he still held in honour among the many myrmidons ?
then they dined all day long until the sun went down
after a convoy on the misty seas ,
however , if we see how , under the pressure of this peace agreement , the dionysian power revealed itself , then we now understand the meaning of the festivals of world redemption and days of transfiguration in the dionysian orgies of the greeks , in comparison with the babylonian sacaea , which turned human beings back into tigers and apes
that i should place a huge loom in the halls
i think i now respect you even more , since you have dared to come outside the wall , to help me , when you saw me in distress , while others all remained inside
at that point many spirits will emerge—they ’ re the shadows of the dead
when they would had their heart 's content of food and drink , telemachus leaned his head close to nestor 's son , so no one else could hear , and spoke to him :
so take the shining reins and whip
as when we were setting up an ambush
after my recognition of that tremendous opposition , i sensed in myself a strong urge to approach the essence of greek tragedy and , in so doing , the deepest insight into the hellenic genius
why do you carry such a bow , as useless as the wind ?
he would been away so long , and pallas athena ,
and then he will know the gods who love himare the best of the immortals and those godswho up to now have guarded trojansin this war 's battles have only little power , as feeble as the wind
so it was right for me , gave me a bath ,
someone can hide a ravenous stomach—
for one can quickly get too much of sorrow ,
then , with a great shout , he called out to his trojans :
who possessed the power of song
idomeneus ' pitiless bronze then struck erymas right in his mouth—the spear forced itself straight through , below his brain , splitting his white skull apart , smashing out his teeth
taking on the likeness of a man , mentes , leader of the cicones , apollo addressed hector with these winged words :
on both sides—each has a narrow entrance ,
swift iris , with feet like wind , went on ahead
the two winds rose up
the bronze breastplate he wore was no protection
then far-seeing zeus carried out a scheme
who in his looks and body was the best
that 's what he will boast
are planning nasty things against me
angry at zeus , her father , athena sat there silently , so enraged she did not say a word
the nymph then dressed me in a cloak and tunic
the brooch on it was made of gold—it had
when fair-haired dawn gave birth to the third day , with my sharp sword and spear i quickly climbed
but all the suitors looked around at one another
youmyrmidons , companions of achilles , son of peleus , be men , my friends , recall your fighting strength , so we may honour the son of peleus , by far the best achaean at the ships , with the finest comrades in a close combat
i will collect the soldiers
then glaucus , son of hippolochus , commanderof the lycians , looking at hector with a frown , criticized him harshly :
you will recite the details of this story , i will tell all men how , of his own free will ,
each one receiving just what zeus desires
you wretched stranger , your mind lacks any sense—you have none at all
then they set off , back to phaeacia
but meriones went after him , as he moved back , and hit him underneath his navel , in the scrotum , the most agonizing way for men to perish miserably in battle
perhaps i might have been able to do that !
then , splitting up , we fanned out in three different groups to hunt
where they will stay safely stored inside for you
how i would join in with fighters in the front
enraged at leucus ' slaughter , odysseus strode up , through the front ranks , armed in gleaming bronze
teucer 's lot gave him first attempt
amphinomus , you seem to be a man
the quality of mentor , alcimus ' son ,
so many riches stored in pheidon 's home ,
instead , you will be content to eat the food supplies which goddess circe gave
until i reached a river , which i thought
to the famous city of the myrmidons ,
give nestor and his sons a glorious name ,
so she went through the house
i staggered out and fell down on the beach ,
a fine intelligence , and thus for women
teucer , with a shudder , spoke out to his brother ajax :
they are to be locked in so that they do not interrupt the revenge killings or run off to raise a general alarm
the dogs went first , ahead of them , following the tracks
i know your courage
those close to himhad better stay here in a single groupto help him off , once my fists have thrashed him
a dreadful flash came from the blazing sulphur
he yanked the stake
are pestering my mother against her will
white-armed hera sent me
sarpedon 's speech stung hector 's heart
at their heart-rending pride and wicked acts
who work to earn their bread
for you to talk in person to the stranger , to hear for yourself what he has to say
fair-haired hecamede made them a soothing drink
they yoked the horses , climbed in the ornate chariot , then drove out from the echoing portico and gate
but come , let 's all follow what i now propose
why should i praise my mother ?
in earlier ages men had set it there to indicate the boundary of a field
charge into a snare set in a thicket , as they seek out
the one that forms the ocean 's navel stone
you have come here to olympus , goddess thetis , though you are grieving , with endless sorrowsin your heart
once he spoke , they all heard him and obeyed at once
in that shape , apollo , zeus ' son , spoke out :
the spear point sliced his tendons , and darkness closed his eyes
which they would received from circe earlier
created by hephaestus 's matchless artistry ,
he forgot , or else grew careless , a lapse within his foolish heart
to the well-decked ship and stowed it all in place , as odysseus ' dear son instructed them to do
the beaters reached a clearing
hear me , god of the silver bow , protectorof chryse , mighty lord of holy cilla , sacred tenedos
into a well-constructed settlement
agamemnon dragged a swift ship down the shore , chose twenty sailors , loaded on the oxen , offerings for the god , and led on fair-cheeked chryseis
but shrewd odysseus , once he would raised the bow and looked it over
when wise athena puts it in my mind ,
about floating back to grim charybdis
i will take you to my wise father 's house ,
there a man who had no need of sleep
when zeus , cronos ' son ,
if alexander 's killed and priamand priam 's children are unwillingto reimburse me , then i will remain here , fight on until i am fully satisfied , until i end this war appropriately
you say the city is a long way off
let your heart be brave , priam , son of dardanus
you must attend to the lid yourself ,
addressed antinous , reprimanding him :
saying a prayer , he set one aside for hermes , son of maia ,
take me alive , and i will ransom myself
i am not sitting in my bedroom hereout of spite or anger with the trojans
and you , my friend , best wishes to you , too
he climbed into his chariot and told his driver to go back to the hollow ships
but the trojans , though confident with their long spears , did not kill anyone , for all their eagerness
you should prepare your dinner and then eat , here in the city , as before
i came to see this land with my own eyes
the arrow , weighted with bronze , went straight through and out the other end
in a bowl carved out of ivy wood he mixed wine sweet as honey
once we would come up really close beside her ,
who dance the best , perform for us , and then
with these words , bright-eyed athena went back to olympus ,
still , he did not escape his fate
breach that argive wall
but as i thought about it ,
a wife whose excellence was truly great
with a groan , the gates of heaven opened on their own , those gates which the seasons , custodians of olympus and great heaven , too , look after , pushing open the heavy cloud , then pushing it shut once more
antenor , i am not pleased with what you have said
in his mind can somehow weave a plan ,
men famous for their ships , spoke to one another—
antilochus took the prize for coming last
away from his companions
but by examining the husk , i think ,
o circe , how can you ask me to be kind to you ?
who wandered far and wide after ravaging
among these men , no one
my child , do not let such things distress your heart
take us alive , son of atreus
a harvest-offering , first fruits of his orchard
as he thought it through , the best thing seemed to be
all memories of home
pity filled my heart
keep this firmly in your mind
the sceptre-bearing king , whose powerful authority comes from zeus , never shares honours equally
we stretch our hands out toward this image , and nature reaches its goal through the deception
and the two princes here agree with me ,
then you must go to hades ' murky home
but if you are having trouble where you are , with fights erupting , then let mighty ajax , son of telamon , come by himself
is not it enough that zeus , cronos ' son , gives me this grief , that i must lose my son , the best one of them all ?
to see if we have any options left
my good mother , why this wish to have me slaughtered ?
men worked hard , falling each tree with a mighty crash
but i will go back now
its roots were black ,
we will get the people to provide the cost
meanwhile , the other men kept up the fight , kept on butchering each other
you would tell me where he 's hiding from my rage
he will tell you your course , the distance you must go on your return ,
when they reached the stately palace , they put their cloaks down on the seats and armchairs ,
from the basket where it lay , and then he hurled it
poseidon heard him make this boastful claim
my family or my native land , in case
on getting married , then let her return
in some hidden corner of this sacred cave ,
offered prizes to some fine phoenicians ,
but when odysseus ' dear son arrives ,
there are two gates for insubstantial dreams ,
as a fine dancing and assembly ground
and from alcinous , the king
so let no one hereturn back towards the ships , now you have heardfrom your commander
to fight against those who outnumber you—
for whom many trojans and achaeans
telemachus said this , then flicked the horses with his whip
by swallowing salt water
report my words precisely
we could not see a thing , and all our ships
in the wooden horse ?
good philoetius , i want you to lock
you will soon come out from under these bad times
how the rest of our comrades came to grief
the upper hand , until achaeans respect my son , until they multiply his honours
the suitors kept throwing spears with frantic haste , but , though there were many , athena made them miss
brought him to crete , as he was sailing on ,
agonizing groans came from those his sword then butchered
then all the other sons of the achaeans
yes , menelaus has just defeated me , but with athena 's help
have not you alreadybeen cooped up long enough within those walls ?
and now , racked with grief and mourning , he shed tears as he addressed them :
among the argives , who were the first and last men killed by hector , son of priam , and brazen ares ?
to the stranger , verbally and with a gift ,
her voice held back every man in that whole army
so come now , before he calls achaeans
if this very day cronos ' son stirred up
you clearly know full well , because you heard me say it—i am intending
take courage , diomedes , in this fight with trojans
they sat there , on the tower , these trojan elders , like cicadas perched up on a forest branch , chirping soft , delicate sounds
concerning me—so i would be reduced
they prepared wine in the mixing bowl , then poured water over the kings ' hands
sthenelus jumped down on the ground
and make your prayers there to athena ,
for nine days apollo rained death down upon the troops
trojans then threw their full weight straight at the danaans , holding spears up high , their hearts hoping they would drag that body away from ajax , son of telamon
the way you talk , so he can cut you up ,
glorious son of atreus , king of men , agamemnon—counselor zeus wo not fulfillall the things that hector has in mind ,
so now , after suffering so much anguish ,
the way he used to or inspects the fields ,
of getting home someday
those who wish to court a noble lady ,
she made his helmet blaze with tireless flames , his shield as well—like a late star in summer which shines especially bright , newly risen from its bath in ocean 's streams
on the twelfth , some god threw him back again into achilles ' hands , who was about to ship him , against lycaon 's wishes , down to dwell with hades
struck each man , then penned them in her pigsties
and then go home and rest
then he spoke out to his master :
and set it down before him
so come , suitors , since your prize seems to be
all achaea 's sons roared out , approving what horse-taming diomedes said
clasping his hands with words of welcome
they heard him shouting out
when you think we have had time to reach my home , then go in the city
that 's how godlike ajax chopped down simoeisius , son of anthemion
as these men toiled in frantic battle , powerful fate drove strong , brave tlepolemus , son of hercules , against godlike sarpedon
but i would do the same
that torment which brings men so many troubles
the men broke up in groups and organized themselves to form five companies , with each one following its own leadership
so argives were forced to move back from the ships ' first row
so glaucus prayed then to apollo :
then , suddenly he pushed the table from him with his foot , spilling food onto the floor—the bread and roasted meat
now , if somehow you could set an ambush
they killed a heifer from the herd , plump hogs as well , as they prepared the meal
he 's knocked the bow out of my hands and snapped
do not you recall the moment you provokeddiomedes , tydeus ' son , to wound me ?
the man who wants to fight courageouslymust stand his ground with force , whether he 's hit , or whether his blows strike the other man
he was the one who would made well-balanced ships for paris at the start of all the trouble , bringing disaster on the trojans and on paris , too , for he was ignorant of what gods had decreed
stored in a polished chest inlaid with gold ,
two feet each way
xanthus , and you podargus , aithus , noble lampus !
so die , all you fleeing trojans , until we reachthat sacred city ilion , with me there , right behind you , fighting and killing you
i answered her and said :
nobody is killing me , my friends ,
that 's how pallas athena shot to earth , then dropped right down into the middle of the soldiers
to follow what i say
when trojans saw mighty idomeneus , like some flame , and his attendant meriones in his richly shining armour , they called out to each other in the crowd , then made a massive charge
armour from the storeroom
and cliffs rise up in a sheer face of rock
standing at one end , chipped and tapered it
not since the day a man from aetolia
as odysseus did before
she gave it me , and , when i would drunk it , without being bewitched ,
he was just starting to recover , to recognize his comrades round him
that would have stilled his heart and stopped his fighting at achaean ships , if teucer had hit him as he was showing off how brave he was
come , you leader of your people , let me be
then each man went to his hut , where he lay down and stretched out to take the gift of sleep
this serenity is a counterpart to the marvelous naïveté of the old greeks , which we must see—in accordance with its given characteristics—as the flowering of apollonian culture , blossoming out of a dark abyss , as the victory over suffering , the wisdom of suffering , which the hellenic will gains through its ability to mirror beauty
nearby was teucer , who would just come from his huts
seeing helen approach the tower , they commented softly to each other—their words had wings :
apollonian tendencies metamorphosed into logical systematizing , something corresponding to what we noticed with euripides , as well as a translation of the dionysian into naturalistic effects
leader of your people , send me back now
we must report this news , though it 's not good , to the danaans waiting to receive it
will send you following winds
and i saw maera and clymene ,
without spilling any blood
when i went away i did not leave behind anyone to protect my property
sly aegisthus , who would killed agamemnon , that splendid man
has suffered such anxiety
and then lost , one she would had loving sex with
then nestor came across the kings the gods sustain— they were walking round among the ships—all the ones whom bronze had wounded—diomedes and odysseus , along with agamemnon , son of atreus
goddess athena with the gleaming eyes then said to him :
and i will speak the truth—if , on my behalf
so now conduct this stranger to your home ,
how unintelligible must faust , the modern cultured man , who is in himself intelligible , have appeared to a true greek -- faust , storming unsatisfied through all the faculties , devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge ; faust , whom we have but to place beside socrates for the purpose of comparison , in order to see that modern man is beginning to divine the limits of this socratic love of knowledge and yearns for a coast in the wide waste of the ocean of knowledge
she simply could not stop her white arms holding him
three times my spirit prompted me to grasp her , and i jumped ahead
helen spoke in tears
when immortal night arrived , we lay down
and there 's a double gateway well fenced in
but you are either weary after so much action , your limbs worn out , or fear has made you timid
make sure you ask him
when they annoy her , daughter of a mighty father
then she heard the wailing , laments coming from the walls
and if we get home , make it to ithaca , our native land ,
nature and the ideal , he says , are either objects of grief , when the former is represented as lost , the latter unattained ; or both are objects of joy , in that they are represented as real
hera has seduced him on a bed of love
we will give you the loveliestof agamemnon 's daughters , bring her herefrom argos , so you can wed her , if you , for your part , will join us to destroythe well-built city ilion
and was the finer man
but i stayed there undaunted , till my mother
you are like a king , the kind of man who bathes
i will tell you something else—take it to heart
daughter of tough-minded atlas , who knows
matching what they received themselves—telemachus , godlike odysseus ' son , had given them those orders
the spartan plain and its surrounding hills ,
so he moved away
brings gifts and puts them in the chariot ,
he took with him the royal staff of his ancestors , eternal and imperishable
forgetting everything i have had to bear ,
patroclus ordered his companions and the women servants to set upa sturdy bed without delay for phoenix
odysseus would come home—that 's what i want
but some time past his fate had struck him and he would gone down to the house of hades
as they were reaching for the food , old dolius appeared
they quickly led out seven women , all well skilled in lovely handiwork
sweet sleep quickly slipped around him
i do not think you can evade poseidon ,
he slumped onto his side , and , as he was hit ,
hector slew stichius and arcesilaus— one a leader of bronze-armed boeotians , one a trusted comrade of brave menestheus
in proper order at each rowing bench ,
make fun of him , as well , when he arrives
they fill their ships and then sail off for home
things you really need
once he would told her everything ,
the initiates in the eleusinian mysteries hoped for a rebirth of dionysus , which we now can understand as the mysterious end of individuation
lived among men in my home , a rich man
it was astonishing—crates full of cheese , pens crammed with livestock—lambs and kids
but i see him for myself
close by them , resourceful odysseus stood among his troops , cephallenian soldiers , powerful fighting men
he spoke out immediately
but when dawn appears , you should stir yourselves so you can set me in my misery
but what if i let achilles , son of peleus , drive them on , then dash away myself to some other place , far from the wall , out in the trojan plain , until i reachida 's spurs , where there 's a bush to hide in ?
what fills your heart—since you have now stopped
with this cupachilles poured libations to no god but father zeus
she climbed the lofty staircase to her chamber ,
even within a well-built farm
or to enjoy myself with my mind relaxed
the title old man of the sea , the name given to proteus in menelaus ' account of his adventures in egypt ( in book ) , is applied here to phorcys as well
the same duality lay over the construction of the drama , as well as over the meaning of the chorus
but come , tell me—
we found them all quite cheerful , eating
later on we will collect throughout the land
he said that he had seen odysseus
back to the ship and urged my comrades
was epicurus an optimist for the very reason that he was suffering ?
belonging to cyclops was lying there
will stand as witnesses for both of us
acts which go on and on , without an end
men put their trust in weaker friends than me—
now both of us share a common fate , to redden the same earthright here in troy
without offering some gift for us to take ,
a lovely , finely woven garment , and tied
but for the moment , let 's agree to dine , though i hate to eat
the warrior who would struck himwas not the weakest of achaeans
are you in truth odysseus ' son ?
your dear sonis ransomed for that huge amount you paid
when zeus ' seasons load their tops with fruit
over the body acamas shouted then in triumph :
one ash spear , weighted down with bronze , fell against the wall
of what the heart inside my chest is urging
if you are holding back in this grim fight , then now 's the day the trojans overcome us
he 's still alive and looking at the sunlight
could set a bride price for his daughter
or other tunics here
earthshaker poseidon led them , gripping in his powerful fist a fearful sword , with a long edge , like a lightning bolt , which no man in grim battle could withstand—his fear would hold him back
someone who looks so much like someone else ,
they will runback to achilles ' ships with many oars
asked them to sit down on soft cushions and eat
of our strong bedroom
then the young men warmed the bow and tested it
than a glimpse of one 's own native land
returning from his travels—there 's still room
people really loved him , for he lived beside a roadand welcomed all passers-by into his home
past men 's farms , walk fast with my attendants
so achilles awarded it to nestor
here the trojans and their allies marshaled forces
let it remain in your dear mother 's room
if someone just feels the urge to change himself and to speak out from other bodies and souls , then that person is a dramatist
that 's what the herder of the bent-horned cattle said
more so than to all other mortal men ,
is it a public or a private matter ?
stored bread and wine and special delicacies ,
had heard it from hermes the messenger
is he a younger or a senior man ?
then resourceful odysseus answered him and said :
then meges killed pedaeus , antenor 's bastard son
first of all , let 's drag the ship onshore , stow all our goods and tackle in the caves
all the pains which grieve my mind and heart
once hera finished , ares struck his sturdy thighs with the flat of his hands and , in his grief , burst out :
a valued female servant
for you , and for your ship
the old man of the sea comes here from egypt , i mean infallible , eternal proteus ,
i was the one who gave him that clothing
in our case , all our throws fall wasted on the ground
with excellent moorage , and from that spot
what about achaea 's other sons , the younger ones ?
at the stern , so odysseus could sleep in peace
he climbed down from the chariot and said :
they heard exquisite music , from apollo 's lyre and the muses ' beautiful song and counter-song
when they are servants to nobility
after that , enjoy your stories
for you , who kept watch over for us , are dead
and try to learn if one of the women
your parents ' breeding has not been destroyed—
and gives me fame and honour
the soldiers heard him and obeyed
the immortal gods to see if zeus
in cyprus , where she has her sanctuary , her sacred altar
from his own home , seeking to prevail with gifts
all phaeacians sat in silence , without saying a word , spellbound in the shadowy hall
to see them again with my own eyes
you must be brave
in his own farmyard , but the swineherd ran up fast behind them , dropping the leather in his hands
and kept shooting volleys of swift arrows
married because she was so beautiful ,
even if a major quarrel should arise ?
scowling at him , cloud-gatherer zeus replied :
have paid the price of their proud arrogance
later , with the corpses on the plain , you will have timeto strip off bodies of the slaughtered men
your mother and your father and the others , those in the town and in the countryside
friends , up to this point , we have not been strangers to misfortunes
the form of the greek theatre is a reminder of a solitary mountain valley
but when the storms
i would be called a coward , a nobody , if i held back from any actionbecause of something you might say
they did not wish to cheat me , but were blown
hector , you are always taking me to task , though i give good advice in our assemblies
well , i suppose i will remain a coward ,
the plastic artist as well as his relation , the epic poet , is absorbed in the pure contemplation of images
a basic issue is the relationship of the greeks to pain , the degree of their sensitivity
and taken from her arms and legs all sense of fear
ares stirred his battle spirit , planning his death at aeneas ' hand
who are you among men ?
who has no clothes or wealth , some pauper ,
to a man in such a mood , however , an old athenian , looking up at him with the sublime eyes of aeschylus , might reply : but say this , too , curious stranger : how much did this people have to suffer to be able to become so beautiful !
but i am not the man to tell achaea 's sonsto drag our well-decked ships into the seaif they are not willing
but move out of the hall and sit outside ,
but he pined away at heart , remaining idle by his ships , yearning for the hue and cry and clash of battle
but all these matters
from that mound they built a wall ,
now my shipshave brought me here as a destroying force , against you , your father , and other trojans
were full of spite :
achilles turned again on agamemnon , atreus ' son , with harsh abuse , his anger still unabated :
the tale of your misfortunes
really bad , while his son is still alive ,
let 's go to that crowd
around her , all her servants
i have roamed through many lands
you slaughtered many men
we had to endure while on board the ships ,
fight the immortal gods all by himself ,
so they were feasting
that 's why you should never treat them kindly , not even your own wife
herdsman , you do not appear to be a man
aeneas then said in response :
to leave the dark heart of the wood
phoebus apollo heard him
and patroclus , too , a man whose counsel
and it 's not right for us to linger here
let 's call on gods to witness , for they are the best ones to observe our pact , to supervise what we two agree on
they reached the two fair-flowing well springs which feed swirling scamander 's stream
to deny him what he asked
next , she laid out a wide variety of food ,
of our healers , podalerius and machaon , one , i believe , lies wounded in our huts , himself requiring some worthy healer , the other 's out there on the plains , holding offthe fighting spirit of the trojans
but hector is a mortal man , suckled at a woman 's breast , while achillesis the child of a goddess i raised myself
and focus on your journey home , i think
these men report back
the fact that death and not exile was pronounced over him socrates himself appears to have brought about , fully clear about what he was doing and without the natural horror of death
especially to athena , zeus ' bright-eyed daughter
now he slept in peace , forgetting all his troubles
the two men drank and quenched their parching thirst
father zeus , who rules both gods and men , you have thundered loud up in the starry sky ,
will be difficult to bear
on his head he set a cap of marten skin , grabbed a sharp spear , and set off , going from the camp towards the ships
the i of the lyric poet thus echoes out of the abyss of being
listen to me now
from the cave mighty polyphemus roared :
so we two stood there in sad conversation ,
and questioned him in person :
with fewer men and only six ships , he sackedthe trojan city and emptied all its streets
who devised this plan all on your own ,
inside the cave with a huge crash
excel all women for your form , your stature ,
round both ajaxes soldiers made a stand and strongly held their ground
as they talked about the kind of man
besides , it ’ s easy to recognize the gods
he says you should wait around till sunset
but at that moment ,
that 's what they thought as they fought one another
noble ajax , son of telamon , leader of your people
here they found achilles ' shade , son of peleus ,
just as the great sea heaves with a sullen purple swell , anticipating the swift passage of sharp winds— but uncertainly—so its waves have no direction , until some steady storm blows down from zeus—that 's how
son of iasus , once the mighty king
he set off among bronze-clad achaeans , seeking heroic machaon
among the suitors , each in turn
a huge white goose , a tame one from some farm
down in the hold , just like a sea bird 's fall
but you have worked very hard , endured a lot—you , your noble father , and your brother—in my cause
but if we two agreed , were of one mind , then troy 's fate would be sealed without delay , without a moment 's pause
and gave him the gold flask full of smooth olive oil
and wove a rope about six feet in length ,
for this is how it will end up , i think ,
i might come , if you sailors were willing to promise me on oath to take me home
but those beside the corpse kept holding their sharp spears , with no pause in the fighting
they have already been assembled ,
orestes slew his father 's murderer ,
all those who live in lovely woods , river springs , and grassy meadows came together at cloud-gatherer zeus ' home , seating themselveson porticoes of polished stone , built there by hephaestus ' cunning arts for his father zeus
besides , she had with her
trojans can expect from zeus more sorrows , more disasters
his heart and mind were not aware that gifts like that , splendid presents from the gods to mortal men , are not so easily defeated , nor do they fail
so far , however , such critics have constituted the audience : the student , the schoolboy , even the innocuous female had been unwittingly prepared by education and newspapers for this kind of perception of works of art
huge rivers , fearful waters , stand between us , first and foremost oceanus , which no man
but , my dear sir , what in the earth is romantic if your book is not ?
in their defensive wall ,
but they did not sleep for long , only for a while , since dawn soon reached there on her golden throne
is she still there with her son , keeping watch on everything ?
are a separate group , closer to the dawn
does wise penelope now know for certain
you will now find genuine welcome and respect
so helen spoke to hector with these soothing words :
the trojans ' wives and daughters ran up round him , asking after children , brothers , relatives , and husbands
i would be left behind ,
he left them there , to chase abas and polyidus , sons of old eurydamas , interpreter of dreams
to carry out the dead
with telemachus ' help he took away
then with his sharp spear menelaus , son of atreus , killed scamandrius , son of strophius , a huntsman
he was born on the banks of the river simoeis ,
they also include what is serious , cloudy , sad , dark , sudden scruples , teasing accidents , nervous expectations , in short , the entire divine comedy of life , including the inferno—all this moves past him , not just like a shadow play , for he lives and suffers in the midst of these scenes , yet not without that fleeting sensation of illusion
then he moved off
an outstanding man , served bread in a fine basket
anyone who murders just one person
but then zeus saved me—he gave me strength and made my legs run faster
they tied me hand and foot onto the ship ,
escaping scylla and dread charybdis ,
then athena , zeus ' daughter , came up to them ,
for his intelligence and offerings
he would fixed a footstool underneath , part of the chair , on which they usually threw a large sheep fleece
quite easily , like drifting down a stream
how i wish i would never won that contest !
but ajax , swift son of oïleus , killed the most
once inside the house and in the courtyard , move through the great hall quickly till you reach
it would be difficult
and observed odysseus , who already had the bow
herald , take this portion of our food
son of splendid menelaus , poured the wine
what demi-god is it to whom the ghostly chorus of the noblest specimens of humanity had to cry out : alas , alas !
so on the fifth beautiful calypso bathed him ,
she met thetis sitting in a hollow cave with other sea godsthronging there around her
i will choose from the many ships , new and old ,
hear what i have to say , so i can speak
and then zeus gave out a sign with a huge peal of thunder
dancing and song—the finest joys of dinner feasts
but apollo confronts us once again as the divine manifestation of the principii individuationis [ the individualizing principle ] , in which the eternally attained goal of the primordial oneness , its redemption through illusion , comes into being
paid no attention to their words
is odysseus still alive
zeus , son of cronos , gives me glory
but keep this news
calypso , the lovely goddess ,
so now , if you can , protect your son
in ithaca , he would have sent you on your way
today 's a banquet day for everyone
his relatives , men and women , wo not be burying him , once he 's dead , with the proper rites of fire
across from them , antilochus lamented , eyes full of tears , as he held achilles by the hand
if so , i will pray to you
just a single man against so many
with some made-up tale
but menelaus was bringing his swift horses in very close behind
agamemnon , you are an excellent man , but do not take briseis from achilles
my dear lady , you are always fancying things
you can rest assured—no other odysseus
and then , when we ,
have killed my animals , the very ones
the dionysian truth takes over the entire realm of myth as the symbol of its knowledge and speaks of this knowledge , partly in the public culture of the tragedy and partly in the secret celebrations of the dramatic mystery celebrations , but always in the disguise of the old myths
were sons of troy and pallas athena
but you must not rejoinares ' conflict until with your own eyes you see me in the morning here again
they struck the gray sea with their oar blades
three times you circled round ,
she fed them and took good care of the old man ,
all around , earth chuckled to see that gleaming bronze
why are you so irritated , hera and athena ?
as he sat in the hall , inciting all his comrades
and choose a painful death
on top of these , he would setan eighth layer made of bronze
given this insight , we can call the chorus , in its primitive stages of the prototypical tragedy , the self-reflection of dionysian men , a phenomenon which we can make out most clearly in the experience of the actor , who , if he is really gifted , sees perceptibly before his eyes the image of the role he has to play , hovering there for him to grasp
when he suddenly showed up , not even
achilles looked at priam , marveling at his royal appearance and the words he heard
just as freezing snowflakes fall thick and fast from zeus , driven by the raging sky-born north wind—that 's how crowds of them streamed out then , pouring from the ships— brightly gleaming helmets , strong-plated body armour , ash spears and embossed shields—the glitter of it allflashed up to heaven
outside the hall , and sat down there , by the altar of great zeus , peering round in all directions ,
to cause trouble for the thesprotians ,
and then summon there
achaeans , what telemachus has said
diomedes slept with the hide of a field ox spread out under him and a bright rug underneath his head
but how seldom does the naïve , that sense of being completely swallowed up in the beauty of appearance , succeed
over three human generations
no one dared stay put as he came in—all rose together
but now these suitors
theseus brought her once away from crete
if she would known achaea 's warrior sons
diverting your attention from this bow string
my gleaming belt protected me on top , as did my body chain mail underneath , forged in bronze
calling the cyclops , although around me
phoebus apollo has saved you one more time
and achaeans will give others , till they fill up each and every pen
with your wife and children there beside you ,
here , take this veil—
the suitors in their hearts felt immediately overwhelmed
welcomed me , without demanding ransom
next on that shield , the celebrated lame god madean elaborately crafted dancing floor , like the one daedalus created long ago in spacious cnossus , for ariadne with the lovely hair
as soon as they gave out the order , the task was done
and live among the dead
cloud-gatherer zeus then said to poseidon in reply :
i do not know any other people , none of those who hold
to a dear friend
just as two furious wild boars fall on the dogs chasing after them , that 's how diomedes and odysseus turned back again to slaughter trojans
at once he recognized pallas athena , the dreadful glitter in her eyes
how i wishyou never had been born or died unmarried
someone ( i do not know who ) asserted that all individuals , as individuals , have to be taken as comic and thus untragic , that the greeks in general could not tolerate individuals in their tragic theatre
a fair , well-balanced mind ?
when he heard these words ,
only one ocean ship ,
those arrogant suitors who upset this home ,
at that point , the argives might well have gone back— contravening what fate had proposed for them—if hera had not spoken to athena :
he did not reply , but left ,
zeus heard of it and annihilated him
be brave , dear nurse , for i have not planned this without help from a god
twelve choice bulls as offerings to poseidon ,
with them went chromius , and godlike aretus , fully hoping in their hearts they would kill the men , then drive those strong-necked horses off
child of arcesius , by far the dearest of all those i cherish ,
from a hollow ship and reach that cavern
there 's hope you will have relief from trouble
that was the scar the old woman was then holding in her hands
meanwhile , peleus ' son , gripping his long-shadowed spear , still eager to kill more , charged asteropaeus , son of pelegon , born to the broad river axius and acessamenus ' eldest daughter , periboea
there fell into my heart
no blows from sharp bronze spears or other wounds from fighting hand-to-hand , the sort one gets so frequently in battle
he was easing his spiritwith a tuneful finely decorated lyre
but we must seek this delight , not in appearances , but behind them
on the fourth day ,
there will be trouble in your home—arrogant men eating up your livelihood and wooing
on our right hand , zeus hurled down lightning bolts , signs manifesting his good will to us
for fine spearman menelaus , son of atreus , caught him as he ran away in front of him , hitting him in the back between his shoulder blades , forcing the spear right through scamandrius ' chest
to odysseus ' home , son of laertes
men can grieve too much
that 's why i have come
from the back , he looked exactly like machaon , son of asclepius
fifty-two hand-picked young men
calypso gave me with my constant tears
for in my heart and mind i know too well
euryalus must apologize in person
then began to speak to them :
to one another , that how these spirits squawked
did hector never sacrifice to you , burning thighs of perfect bulls and goats ?
not long ago , when our achaean shipsgathered at aulis , bringing disasterfor priam and his trojans , we sacrificed on holy altars placed around a spring hundreds of perfect creatures to the gods , the immortals—underneath that tree , a lovely plane tree , where bright water flowed
where there was no way to escape
not even swift well-balanced ships get through
but come , i will keep you free from harm and save you
and these same symptoms allow us to infer the same lack at the heart of this culture , the destruction of myth
everything which comes to the surface in the apollonian part of greek tragedy , in the dialogue , looks simple , translucent , and beautiful
his words had wings :
but i carried the dog off
i will suspend the fighting for the length of time you have asked for
should one of you meet his fate and die , stabbed by a spear or cut down with a sword , let the man die
who 's been absent for so long
huge tawny beasts , both well fed on grass ,
zeus-fostered king , we will indeed tell him
from his dear native land , not even if
to keep going on his trip , he stayed there ,
i tell you , he wo not go back without you
hector drove his fine-maned horses back and forth , his eyes glaring like a gorgon or man-killing ares
never since aristotle has an explanation of the tragic effect been offered from which aesthetic states or an aesthetic activity of the listener could be inferred
and , sitting well in order , raised their oars
struck hard against the ground
like a gust of wind , athena slipped over to the young girl 's bed ,
with bushy horsehair plumes
from my father in this way ?
for you wo not be competing as a boxer , or in wrestling , or the spear throw
you are plotting mischief now , inviting me to go up to your room ,
but other gods had gathered
to see which men would risk their lives with me—
but he never did return to his own country
lycian leaders are pressing us so hard , the ones who previously in bloody fightshave demonstrated their ferocity
alas , what a useless promise i made then , the day i tried to cheer menoetius upat home , telling him when i would sacked ilion , i would bring his splendid son back there to him , in opoeis , and with his share of trophies
first cloud-gatherer zeus fathered dardanus , who built dardania , for sacred ilion , city of mortal men , was not yet builthere in the plain
his huge and pleasant livelihood
but come , first let your sure-footed horsescharge at ares
but hermes the helper came up by himself , took the old man 's hand , then asked him questions :
tragedy absorbs the highest ecstasies of music , so that it truly brings music , both among the greeks and among us , to its perfection ; but then it places the tragic myth and the tragic hero next to it , and he , like a powerful titan , takes the whole dionysian world upon his back and thus relieves us of this burden
so he went to hector , stood by him , and said :
if you are indeed a god and have listened to that goddess when she speaks ,
but surely it 's already clear by now
the next man to charge against him was harpalion , son of king pylamenes , who came to fight at troy following his dear father
there i saw argive helen ,
i noticed the tunic on his body—
i lack all this , though personally for me
and tell me of my father and my son ,
shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
middle-class mediocrity , on which euripides built all his political hopes , now came into prominence
then , with his great cunning , he told his wife to place before the suitors
it struck menelaus ' shield , a perfect circle , but the bronze did not break through , the point deflected by the powerful shield
woman takes a thousand steps to get her way
swift achilles was still pressing hector hard in that relentless chase
at offering advice and making speeches
once they climbed out of that well-built rowing ship onto dry land , first they took odysseus out ,
and suffered much gets pleasure from his woes
give you , stranger , the thing you most desire ,
that staunch perseverance which characterized , for example , the national instincts of the romans , probably does not belong among the necessary predicates of perfection
trojans hearts were seized with grief
in the river pools , eels and fish were much distressed—they jumped everywhere in that fine river , suffering the fiery blasts prepared by that resourceful god hephaestus
she spoke out and said :
i want the people safe , not all killed off
in a forest clearing they found circe 's house—
i am alone , so bring some help
moving up close to the dead body , he spoke out , addressing warlike menelaus :
across the restless sea
in his own house
calling to his father , who was close by :
inside the palace of splendid menelaus
and made a quick prayer to great zeus ' daughter :
aphareus ' head snapped back—his shield and helmet fell down on him , and death , which takes the living spirit , gathered him in
for athena planned the battle out in just that way
for that man was no prophet calchas , who reads our omens
i heard the lowing cattle being penned
my friend , that is precisely the poet 's work—
come now , tell me—and be sure to speak the truth
bear his fame far and wide among all men ,
there , in the large shrine , leto and artemis , the archer goddess , healed aeneas , restoring him to his former power and magnificence
i will tell you i have not been pent up here with my consent
steep mountain peaks and by the river springs
burial ; amphimedon complains to agamemnon about his death at odysseus ' hands ; agamemnon pays tribute to odysseus and penelope ; odysseus goes out to find his father ; laertes and odysseus talk in the vineyard , and odysseus tests his father with a false story and then reveals his identity ; the two men return to laertes house , where eumaeus , philoetius , and telemachus have prepared dinner ; laertes ' appearance is transformed ; dolius and his sons arrive ; the men in ithaca hear about the slaughter and collect their dead ; eupeithes urges action against odysseus ; medon and halitherses advises against such action ; the majority decide to follow eupeithes ; athena questions zeus about his intentions regarding odysseus ; zeus tells her to deal with the situation ; odysseus and his followers arm themselves and go out to meet the ithacan army ; athena urges laertes to throw a spear ; laertes kills eupeithes ; athena stops the ithacan army and sends it back to the city ; a thunderbolt from zeus stops odysseus ; athena establishes a lasting oath between both sides ]
to hear from the massive towering oak tree ,
for twelve days he 's lain there , but his fleshhas not decayed
powerful diomedes then answered odysseus :
apple upon apple , grapes in cluster after cluster , and fig after fig
to organize my escort and give splendid gifts ,
to tell her she should end her tears and sorrow
menelaus , so good at battle shouts ,
poseidon would strike her and then throw up
the brave epeians were encircling the city , hearts set on razing it
he smiled , then said , as he spoke to the argives :
loved , and fed me
and do not , in your miserable state ,
thinking how to kill the suitors with athena 's help
his words spurred on the swineherd
and moved up to the foredeck of the ship ,
with a scowl , hector of the flashing helmet then replied :
seeing them coming , sthenelus , capaneus ' brave son , at once spoke up to diomedes—his words had wings
she stood by odysseus ' broad-beamed black ship in the middle of the line , so she could be heard in both directions , from the huts of ajax , son of telamon , to those of achilles , whose well-balanced ships were drawn up at the ends , for these men trusted courage and their own strong hands
some distance from the path , in case someone came by , before odysseus could wake up , stumbled on them , and robbed him
but he went off to argos , where horses graze ,
i sent out scouts to go up to the lookouts
but you , son of atreus , check your anger
why should you be so concerned about it ?
in a rich house , too , among my people
myth , the necessary prerequisite of any religion , is already paralyzed everywhere , and even in this domain the optimistic spirit , which we have just designated as the germ of destruction in our society , has attained the mastery
you will find zeus-fostered kings in there feasting
the cattle herder answered him :
while you were somewhere far away
i cherished and looked after , and i said
my kinsmen , the ones a man relies on
and there were many in the room
i am not surehe 's not a god
just as four stallions yoked together charge ahead across the plain , all running underneath the lash , and jump high as they gallop quickly on their way ,
after he would said this , her words could find no wings
they skillfully bound up
but he looks broaderin his shoulders and his chest
rubbed him with oil , and put a tunic on him ,
then wind-swift iris came to troy as messenger from aegis-bearing zeus carrying grim news
in honour of his noble son and daughter
while he 's still alive and sees the sunlight , he lives in sorrow
to frustrate hearts in our achaean chests
hoisted the white sail , and then set off ,
but dreadful pain came in my heartand spirit when that man wished to cheatsomeone his equal and steal away that prize , and just because he 's got more power
as he threw , trojans moved back , but the spear found a mark
but for all that , i urge my lycian troops to action , i stand and fight all comers on my own , when i have nothing for the enemy to take
from the way his body looks he 's no weakling—not in his thighs and calves ,
to escape the wrath of zeus , not unless
called her into the storage room , then said :
we dragged it out into the glittering sea ,
friends , this man 's hands have been invincible , but now they will stop
i will tell you what fate has in store for you
to set foot on the shore
and spread out lovely purple blankets over them ,
let me remain forever in your city , since it seems i will not be going hometo cheer up my dear wife and infant son
you got here on foot faster than i did , sailing my black ship
or in response to what some god has said ,
i will be as tough as a hard stone or iron
you understand what sort of spirit lies
with respect to this practical pessimism , socrates is the original picture of the theoretical optimist , who in the belief ( which i have described ) that we could discover the nature of things conferred upon knowing and discovering the power of a universal medicine and understood evil-in-itself as error
even a fool can see that father zeusis now personally helping trojans
i went to circe ,
to demodocus , so that he can eat
be brave , and do not weigh down your heart with this
you want me now to go to battle
but they fill up our house day after day ,
and then your heart , divinely raised menelaus , had no desire to help defend the hard-pressed comrades left there by antilochus , men of pylos , who felt his loss severely
when they would had their fill of food and drink , beautiful divine calypso
that 's what she said
old man , in this fightthese young men are pressing you too hard
i will tell you this—
snow melts away under west wind 's thaw ,
the subjective mood , the emotional state of the will , communicates with the surroundings we contemplate , and the latter , in turn , gives its colour to our mood , in a reflex action
but i was left heart-sick
each one with harsh opinions of the other ,
for i have never clapped eyes on you beforein those fights where men win glory
let 's go back to our own dear country in our ships
my cloak behind with my companions
and , sitting in good order in their rows ,
now once again you gods are envious ,
hector of the flashing helmet made no reply
and run my hand along his chest , to find
achilles carved , while automedon held the meat
so come on now ,
but you should go up to your own chamber
and alcinous , the king
rushed up to clasp telemachus ' knees , and begged—
his spirit went to hades
when the others reached the huts of nestor , neleus ' son , they stepped out on the fertile earth
inside my hollow ship , so as to stop
looking on , athena and hera teased zeus , son of cronos :
thought of something else
as for scylla , the father of gods and men
after all , one should not demand of what is noblest of all that it should have the durable toughness of leather
the broad flowing river could not slow him down , once athena had put great power in achilles
then old warrior echeneus addressed them all—
are willing , the ones who hold wide heaven ,
but they all laughed ,
felt strong once again
his horses , frightened by their master 's threat , ran faster for a stretch
achilles charged offin pursuit , chasing apollo out across the plain , past wheat fields , turning him towards the river , the deep , swirling scamander
and drunk wine to their heart 's content , odysseus , a crafty man who had a trick in mind , spoke out :
as it pushed a massive wave
father zeus , if , among the deathless gods , i have ever served you well in word or deed , then grant my prayer will be fulfilled
herald , why have these noble suitors
now you are madly eagerto throw deadly fire on our sea-going ships , to kill achaean warriors
then she organized her plans
then there 's no fear you will suffer anything
on my own strength to guard me from a man
makes them supremely arrogant
in your own home
once you have takenhector 's life , return back to the ships
and the voyage which i have talked about
while the critic got the upper hand in the theater and concert hall , the journalist in the schools , and the press in society , art degenerated into a particularly lowly topic of conversation , and aesthetic criticism was used as a means of uniting a vain , distracted , selfish , and moreover piteously unoriginal sociability whose character is suggested by schopenhauer 's parable of the porcupines
let us recollect further that kant and schopenhauer made it possible for the spirit of german philosophy , streaming from similar sources , to destroy scientific socratism 's complacent delight in existence by establishing its boundaries ; how through this delimitation was introduced an infinitely profounder and more serious view of ethical problems and of art , which we may designate as dionysian wisdom comprised in concepts
all the splendid gifts phaeacian noblemen
he looked like this—he had rounded shoulders ,
stranger , you are a fool , or else you have come
and hide these goods phaeacian noblemen
just as a sharp spasm seizes women giving birth , a piercing labour pain sent by the eilithyiae , hera 's daughters , who control keen pangs of childbirth , that 's how sharp pain sapped agamemnon 's fighting strength
in the front hall she found cups and tables left by those who had been feasting there ,
the far shooter tricked him , by standing right before achilles ' feet , looking exactly like agenor
right then war-loving achaeans would have driven trojansback to ilion , conquered by their own cowardice , with argives winning glory beyond what zeus decreed , through their own strong power
and women servants piled some baskets full of bread , while young lads filled their bowls up to the brim with drink
would have been too horrible to bear ,
when they had lashed the rigging on that fast black ship , they set out bowls brimful of wine and poured libations to the eternal ageless gods , and of them all
this anchorage here belongs to phorcys ,
all blamed the son of cronos , lord of the dark cloud , because he planned to give glory to the trojans
may turn out for the best
none of my ships was harmed , no one got sick
the animal 's head above the much-travelled earth
on a black merchant ship with twenty oars ,
most dread son of cronos , what are you saying ?
come , stand by great ajax , son of telamon !
so then i answered her :
i have already made a solemn promise
fierce ares has scattered their dark bloodbeside the fair-flowing scamander river
thus for the mortal eye the inextricably tangled legal knot of the oedipus story is slowly untangled , and the most profound human joy suffuses us with this divine dialectical companion piece
so much bread and meat , they were keen to get some rest
until the gods delivered me from trouble
one always held the reins—he was the driver
from what she has in store
nestor , chromius , noble periclymenus ,
consult the shade of that theban prophet ,
and poplar , too , with long-winged birds nesting there—
so quick-eyed achaeans are sending chryseis in fast ships back to chryse , transporting gifts for lord apollo , and heralds cameto take away briseis from my huts , the girl who is my gift from achaea 's sons
he had a son , glaucus , father of handsome bellerophon
i will bring you each a wife , and i will provide
are you on business ?
it drove clean through his chest
but now the man who has a claim to be the greatest of achaeans has witnessed it
when he would eaten and the godlike singer finished , the suitors were making an uproar in the room
and was visible to no one but odysseus
have you not reached ithaca , nor seen your wife in your own home ?
i will go to ithaca and urge his son
menelaus had in mind
and went off to explore
so now let everyoneturn round and face the enemy directly , whether to survive or die
old godlike priam then said in answer to achilles :
telemachus with the swineherd and goat keeper
in this way the gods justify the lives of men because they themselves live it—that is the only satisfactory theodicy !
but now this music becomes perceptible to him once again , as in a metaphorical dream image , under the influence of apollonian dreaming
in my heart and craving my dear husband ,
relying on this noble deception , it may now move its limbs in dithyrambic dances and yield unhesitatingly to an ecstatic feeling of freedom in which it could not dare to wallow as pure music without this deception
people sayyou are noble peleus ' son , your motherfair-haired thetis , daughter of the sea
they quickly set the urn down in a shallow grave , covered it with large stones set close together , then hurried to pile up the mound , posting sentries on every side , in case well-armed achaeans attacked too soon
so deep , courageous , and spiritual , so exuberantly good and tender did this chorale of luther sound -- as the first dionysian luring call breaking forth from dense thickets at the approach of spring
patroclus , you thought you would raze our city , robbing our women of their life of freedom , taking them in ships to your dear native land
it hit aeneas ' hip , where thigh meets pelvis , what people call the hip joint
child of zeus , if you give the order ,
one needs to live—things i will remember ,
i saw , while sitting on the well-decked ship—
for nine days immortals have been quarrelingabout achilles , sacker of cities , and hector 's corpse
i will tell you the truth of what you have asked me
i will add a gold half-talent to your prize
his food and drink , once his legs grow weary
keen to reach me
of what fate had in store
his gold did not spare him a wretched death
for how could we compel nature to yield up its secrets , if not for the fact that we fight back against her and win , that is , if not for the fact that we commit unnatural actions ?
the farmyard and the pigs in countless numbers ,
in a huge rage , he sent down gold-winged iris with a message for them
so he prepared to go outside
there , once he would washed his hands in gray salt water , to athena he made this prayer :
moving up close to patroclus , achilles said :
peleus ' son held the shield away from him in his big fist , fearing the long-shadowed spear from brave aeneas would easily go through
or were you alone with sheep or cattle ?
if nobody is hurting you and you are alone , it must be sickness given by great zeus ,
his legal children from his lawful wife
in that , too , there is an art , as in certain romance novels of the present time
earth flowed black with blood
something clear so i can be quite certain
while iphitus was enquiring
or did you come on other people 's ship
to some bath attendant or another slave
up to this point , we have considered the apollonian and its opposite , the dionysian , as artistic forces which break forth out of nature itself , without the mediation of the human artist and in which the human artistic drive is for the time being satisfied directly—on the one hand as world of dream images , whose perfection has no connection with an individual 's high level of intellect or artistic education , on the other hand , as the intoxicating reality , which once again does not respect the individual , but even seeks to abolish the individual and to restore him through a mystic feeling of collective unity
now all those bodies
i ran away through all of spacious hellas , then came a suppliant to fertile phthia , where flocks are bred , to king peleus
in all they went through over there , the things
he quickly climbed up on one of the horses
aphrodite spoke , then loosened from her breasts the finely decorated , embroidered garment in which all her magic charms were fixed—for love , erotic lust , flirtation , and seduction , which steals the wits even of clear-thinking men
my weaving would be wasted and in vain
some god was guiding us
he went on the run through achaean huts and ships
around the fields looking for laertes
he sat beside the steering oar and used his skill to steer the raft
if you linger by the cliff to arm yourself , i fear she will jump out once more , attack you with all her heads and snatch away six men , just as before
although you have truly suffered much bad luck
here 's a man who will get one for us
while sleep , who relaxes troubled human hearts ,
taking out another arrow , teucer tried to hit bronze-armed hector
thus that old man , skilled in war 's traditions , roused his men
i myself am young—
into a lovely harbour , with a sheer cliff
and had a sumptuous feast
a splendid golden belt around her waist
zeus has given me a glimpse of land ,
great telamonian ajax then answered him :
he might see me , as i moved off from the city for the plain , and catch me with a sprint of his swift feet
son of atreus , why ask me that question ?
one had to destroy tragedy , too , in order to be able to live away from the soil of home , uninhibited , in the wilderness of thought , custom , and deed
the people came as soon as dawn appeared—
i claim to come from sidon , rich in bronze
the rock he planted right in his doorway
famine never comes there ,
peisenor , a herald who provided shrewd advice ,
antinous , son of eupeithes , spoke up :
so we can dislodge him from the threshold ,
you have undertaken will be pointless
the belly of the sail filled up with wind , and the ship sailed on its way
they may say nice things , but they are making plans for nasty schemes in future
a threat for which there was no remedy—
does not match your looks—you would refuse to give
so hermes traveled with him , bringing willing favours
just like that star which stands out the loveliest among all those in the heavenly night sky—the star of evening—
bring your ship back to your dear native land in secret ,
you are still ignorant , it seems , of the fact that i am a god
i think i loved those things because a god
the fame of this wall will reach everywhere , as far as light of dawn
just as a mountain falcon , the fastest creature of all the ones which fly , swoops down easily on a trembling pigeon as it darts off in fear , the hawk speeding after it with piercing cries , heart driving it to seize the prey—in just that way achilles in his fury raced ahead
but if achillesdoes not learn this from a god who speaks to him , then he may be fearful if some god appearsagainst him in the battle
even for a blessed god—that 's how skillfully
and was carried off by dreadful winds
in this shape , divine aphrodite spoke to helen :
men looked and were astounded
she used to stroll along
but he refused , continuing to mourn :
he dumped swift arrows right there at his feet and then addressed the suitors :
teucer slaughtered lord aretaon , and antilochus , nestor ’ s son , with his glittering spear killed ableros
to set a bed outside , under the portico ,
there 's a huge fig tree there with leaves in bloom
nor was i coward
you are abusive to odysseus ' slaves ,
as we talked together , some women came ,
when we would sailed past crete , we saw land no more , only sky and sea
you would not think he 's just come from some fight
as my master ordered , and get there today—
as he saw them approach , achilles felt no joy
in ocean 's backward-flowing stream , just as
we checked out the rigging on our ship and then sat down
then zeus , son of cronos , stole glaucus ' wits , for he gave tydeus ' son his golden armour , worth one hundred oxen , exchanging that for armour made of bronze , worth only nine
so ajax finished with his mouth and nostrils full of dung , as resilient odysseus raced on ahead , came in first , and won the prize
just when i would lost hope , and i have made my way
offered up with love—in honour of our guest
aeneas , counselor to bronze-armed trojans ,
old man , tell me about your troubles
with his body wrapped in wretched clothing
so she does not mar her lovely face with tears
that 's how the wolves and sharp-clawed lions there kept fawning round those men , who were afraid
you have returned from wandering around
after he would given countless courtship gifts
is it not sufficient that in days past ,
to my native land
iasus , a commander of athenians , was known as a son of sphelus , son of bucolus
calypso , the lovely goddess , went back home
through all its days it 's never once been sown
after all , they bring you presents , many pleasing gifts , to helice and aegae
this man here has saved your life
and in a raft—a harsh and dangerous trip
but then achilles met someone fleeing the river— lycaon , a son of dardanian priam , whom he would captured once before in a night attack , taking him against his will from his father 's orchard
he nodded at the woman ,
those serving at the meal laid down a portion of the meat in front of him
and has requested confirmation from us
but these things are in the lap of the gods
if somehow my crewmen and myself
they carved the body quickly , cutting thigh bones out , all in proper order , and then covered them
then he stripped their armour
that in years past you have been kind to me ,
he would never been among achaean ships—
with you an only son and so well loved ?
whenever battles start , i stand and fightwith men in front , in those encounters where men win glory
that tribute made , they drank wine to their heart 's content
and godlike eurylochus led the other
danaans then began to push the trojans back
in a fine cloak and tunic and led me
that was how i started
my comrades cautioned me from every side ,
too much hospitality or not enough
will come into the home of odysseus ,
i brought her up and gave her to peleusto be his wife , a man dear to the heartsof the immortal gods
i will stir up some winds—
for in this way he will be able to determine to what extent he is capable of understanding myth as a concentrated image of the world that , as a condensation of phenomena , can not dispense with miracles
in his heart achilles sensed their purpose
once they would rowed on well beyond the sirens ,
but pallas athena grabbed it and returned it to achilles , without hector , that shepherd of his people , seeing what she would done
and move inside the finely furnished house
why is that mighty god now summoning me ?
as far as i know , thoas , no one 's to blame
for meyou got the value of a hundred oxen ,
it depends far more on those great rhetorical-lyrical scenes in which the passion and dialectic of the main hero swelled up into a wide and powerful storm
for all their numbers , they could not hold their ground outside the city walls
i know well that in my master 's journey home
patroclus had owned nine dogs who ate beside his table
but we have got hands to raise in their defense
she came up to she gave the same instructions ,
then meriones , the fifth contestant in the race , harnessed his fine-maned horses , and all the racers climbed in their chariots
as when young men and hunting dogs harass a boar , the beast charges from dense foliage on every side , whetting white teeth on its curving jaws , and they dodge all round it , to the sound of champing tusks , hunters and dogs standing firm , for all their fear—
the others kept on fighting
three times apollo pushed back his shining shield
sleep in your soft bed
back through the house , until they reached telemachus
she led me in
wise eurycleia then answered him :
there are countless crops and wine-bearing grapes
she saw her father standing in his chariot , together with his herald , the town crier
right now i am always grieving for the boy ,
we will leave him behind
and to the influence of this outrage we can ascribe the fact that the view of greek antiquity as a time of rose-coloured serenity lasted for centuries with almost invincible tenacity , as if greek antiquity had never produced a sixth century , with its birth of tragedy , its mystery cults , its pythagoras and heraclitus , indeed , as if the artistic works of the great age simply did not exist—although these works , each and every one of them , can not be explained at all on the grounds of such a senile joy in existence and serenity , moods appropriate to a slave , or of things which testify to a completely different world view as the basis of their existence
before i could do that , she slaughtered me , her husband
there were young lads dancing , whirling to the constant tunes of flutes and lyres , while all the women stood beside their doors , staring in admiration
achilles , son of peleus , mightiest
you mean laertes ' son , from ithaca
he would look out , through his tears , over the restless sea
i was badly beaten down—on board ship
and for her husband 's bed , or to go now
out in the open courtyard
till that time , you will lie like this with me by my beaked ships , and round you trojan and dardanian womenwill keep lamenting night and day , shedding tears , the very women we two worked hard to winwith our strength and our long spears , by lootingprosperous cities of mortal men
then they fell asleep
odysseus did not plan these acts
with prayers and vows
they lay together there covered with a cloud , a lovely golden mist , from which fell glistening dew
into my house and entertained him well , with a kind welcome , using the rich store
ca not each of them go roundwaking up the kings ?
to your own children , so that something bad
some time in the night , long-haired achaeans may make their move to get away by sea
his heart was hatching trouble for the suitors
would anyone have acted otherwise ,
instilled fresh spirit in them all
but hectorcharged on from where he ’ d first breached the gates and wall , smashing up the close-packed ranks of the danaans , right to the ships of protesilaus and ajax , drawn up on the beach beside the blue-gray sea
as it came out , i struck it in the spine ,
then some other man stood here
i do not go to the city , unless i am called
to be given to me
i am still too young and can not yet rely
unless philoetius has killed him ,
brandishing his spear , powerful diomedes yelled :
these things concern your heart
around his legs he would tied shin pads stitched from ox-hide to protect himself from scratches , and on his hands he had on gloves , since there were thistles in that spot
he took the form of phaenops , son of asius , of all hector 's guests the one he liked the most
instantly prepared to listen :
but when they came within the distance of a spear throw or even less , he saw that they were enemies and started running , to get away as quickly as his legs could carry him
there was no moon
trojans , in full retreat , passed the wall and ditch , with many slaughtered by danaans
but if a man is innocent and thinks
but when zeus , son of cronos , brought to us
he did not try to tell me any details
grant that i see the day of my return
but it is just as certain that in those places where the first onslaught was halted , the high reputation and the majesty of the delphic god manifested itself more firmly and threateningly than ever
or when he turns again from heaven to earth
would you were safely by your ships dry-eyed
unraveling on the straps—the two men jumped out
before he can quickly get to pylos
his eyes saw me and knew just who i was
so come on , climb up into my chariot
hera 's entreaties have persuaded them
silver-footed thetis then said in reply :
what my eyes witness here astounds me , a dreadful thing i never thought would happen— trojans moving up to our own ships , men who previously were shy , like deer , which in the woods are prey to jackals , wolves , and leopards , as they wander round , alone and frightened , with no will to fight
once they had all eaten their fill of food and drink , geranian horseman nestor was the first to speak
to come here , so i can greet him warmly
that is how the delphic god interpreted the greek past
warlike podarces , son of iphicles , led them— the man owned many flocks and was a young blood brotherto protesilaus
let me tell you something which is sure to happen—if you slack off nowand i win some inferior prize , then nestor , his people 's shepherd , will stop feeding you
when he said this , laertes felt great joy and said :
half way up the rock face there 's a shadowy cave
but that was now impossible
when atreus ' son menelaus , skilled at war shouts , threw his spear , he hit helenus in the hand , the one which held the finely polished bow
and added many tasty delicacies as well ,
but , i tell you , he 's not yet escaped being killed
playing checkers right outside the door , sitting down on hides of cattle they themselves had butchered
all men need the gods
the cyclopes do not have boats with scarlet prows or men with skills to build them well-decked ships , which would enable them to carry out
but every man he looked at—
myself , i would rather leave you at the farm
these carcasses they skinned and dressed and then prepared a splendid banquet
and athena also came , ready to receive the sacrifice
ships were smashing into one another ,
swift-footed achilles then answered agamemnon :
the one they have gotwo not work , since anger still keeps me away
in your home , unless there is an old one ,
it 's dangerous to come to blows with thosemarried to cloud-gatherer zeus
his other clutched the spear , refusing to let go
hector of the flashing helmet turned his eyes to one side and shook out the lots
now , there 's a certain city thryoessa , far off on a steep hill by the alpheius , at the very end of sandy pylos
loved in all sorts of ways
so now go on your own and challenge him
with a double fold , and a fringed tunic ,
hear what i have to say
whereas in all productive men instinct is the truly creative and affirming power , and consciousness acts as a critical and cautioning reaction , in socrates the instinct becomes the critic , consciousness becomes the creator—truly a monstrous defect
he could smear on his bronze arrow points
to what then does the mystery of this oneness of german music and philosophy point if not to a new form of existence , concerning whose character we can only inform ourselves by surmise from hellenic analogies ?
achilles served the meat
should zeus ever grantwe pillage troy , a city rich in goods , we will give you three or four times as much
the god-like man climbed in , held back the reins
it has soft , well-watered meadows
but i will not stop killingthese proud trojans till i have them corneredin their city and have tested hectorin a fight , and he kills me or i kill him
the road lies there in front of you
and strive for evil , for no one here , none of those whom divine odysseus ruled ,
i think i may provoke someone who wields great power over argives , a man who is obeyed by everyone
so none of us could recognize the man
go now , swift iris , convey to lord poseidon these instructions , report it all precisely—he 's to stop , to leave the battle strife , and go awayto the group of gods or to his sacred sea
you know , when he went off
the mightiest and most terrible oath
father , i think you will later come to recognize
with all my family safe
it is like the relationship of the entrancing vision of the tortured martyr to his pain
the higher truth , the perfection of this condition in contrast to the sketchy understanding of our daily reality , as well as the deep consciousness of a healing and helping nature in sleep and dreaming , is the symbolic analogy to the capacity to prophesy the truth , as well as to art in general , through which life is made possible and worth living
you people should disperse , each one
the oaken axle groaned aloud , weighed down , bearing the fearful goddess and the finest man
and then , menelaus , they would have seen you die at hector 's hands—he was by far the stronger man— if wide-ruling agamemnon , son of atreus , king of the achaeans , had not hurried up , grabbed you by your right hand , and said these words :
let people merely recall the consequences of the socratic sayings virtue is knowledge ; sin arises only from ignorance ; the virtuous person is the happy person
she placed a well-washed cloak around his body , then made him taller and restored his youthful looks
and spoke at once to his phaeacians , master sailors
standing upright at the mast
mine and the immortals
menelaus , skilled at war shouts , followed his advice
the breaking waters pushed him backwards
thus , you should go
get outside , you wretch , and be satisfied
he stood holding his clear-toned lyre by the side door , his mind divided—should he slip out from the hall and take a seat close to the altar of great zeus , god of the courtyard , where laertes and odysseus had burned many thighs from sacrificial oxen ,
they did not disobey , but dressed themselves in bronze , opened the doors , and went outside , with odysseus in the lead
this is now the ninth revolving year we have been waiting here , on this very spot
all right , i will say what seems to me the best
that 's what nestor said , and the brave achaeans stopped their running
the defiant titan prometheus reported to his olympian torturer that for the first time his rule was threatened by the highest danger , unless he quickly joined forces with him
there were nine groups , each with five hundred people and nine offerings of bulls ready to sacrifice
father , what my eyes are witnessing is an enormous wonder
his words had wings :
commands respect , even with deathless gods—
they left behind them the cities of lemnos and imbros , moving quickly , then came to mount ida with its many springs , mother of wild creatures , and arrived at lectum , where for the first time they left the sea
the man she loves
to toiling men , each and every one of them ,
his head , and his hair on top
odysseus ' dear son rushed to put on a bright tunic ,
and stood there , on a rugged outcrop ,
with both fists on the jaw , smash all his teeth
as he dies , she sees him gasping his last breath , embraces him , and screams out her laments ,
my excellence in form and body
there in the city all were overcome with grief beyond anyone 's control
how my heart pities hector , who 's often sacrificed to me , burningmany thighs of oxen on the crestsof ida with its many spurs and valleys , on the city heights , as well
prosperity and his knees stay supple
once you strike at themit ca not stop flesh-ripping bronze
but now , he 's forgotten that and helps the trojans
then in his anger he threw the sceptre on the ground and burst out crying
the gristle hit the solid wall
the best men put on the best equipment , the worst men got the worst
he was sitting with the suitors , his heart troubled , picturing in his mind how his noble father
let others swear a solemn oath as friends
across the restless sea , leaving lovely scheria
i do believefather zeus must hate me , to give me to youfor a second time
for hector then will speak out in troy
a dust cloud rose above him , his dark hair spread out round him , and hector 's head , once so handsome , was covered by the dust , for zeus had given him to his enemies to dishonour in his own native land
with goddess aphrodite in the lead , they came to alexander 's lovely house
take care to welcome him with honour ,
let no one believe that the german spirit has forever lost its mythical home when it can sill understand so plainly the voices of the birds that tell of that home
then they , too , lay down in the shadowy hall to sleep
i guarantee i would pay you—gathering stones
who has had to suffer such misfortune
by contrast , the tragic chorus of the greeks is required to recognize the shapes on the stage as living , existing people
tied some fine sandals on his feet , took a strong spear , well suited to his grip , and , as he headed off
then the whole bunch disappeared , all of them
in his hand he held two spears
everyone who saw it was astonished
were overcome with passionate weeping ,
and almost hit the steering oar
they both let fly together—one with a sharp spear , the other with an arrow from his bowstring
glorious achilles , if your mindis really set on going back , if youare totally unwilling to protectour swift ships from destructive fire , because that anger has consumed your heart , how can i remain here , dear lad , alone , away from you ?
he calmed himself , right up to his last days , with the interpretation that his philosophizing was the highest musical art , and believed that it was incorrect that a divinity would remind him of common , popular music
i will take my ship and my own company
asked me why i would come to lovely sparta ,
tended by foreign herdsmen or his own
but trojans kept on pouring in
and lived alone , away from all the rest , a law unto himself , a monster , made
inside your halls , and every man will bring
another of achaea 's well-dressed women ,
if it now seems as if the lyrical genius and the non-genius bound up with him were one and the same and as if the first spoke that little word i about himself , then this illusion could no longer deceive us , not at least in the way it deceived those who have defined the lyricist as a subjective poet
the heart here in my chest gets full of grief ,
and so the aristophanic euripides gave himself high praise for how he presented common , well-known , ordinary living and striving , which any person was capable of judging
turn them back again
so amphinomus addressed them all and said :
and now prepare a meal , while we stay put
full of water , and a bag of food , in which she put many tasty things for him to eat
that was what zeus willed—other gods , as well
the heart in mighty ajax recognized gods ' work
around malea , driving me past cythera
to his high-roofed house and native land
paris did not wait for long in his high-roofed home
resourceful odysseus then said to telemachus :
to set ares free
and three rows of teeth packed close together , full of murky death
about his comrades who went there with him
he dug a trench ,
you proud-hearted trojans , do not be afraid of that son of peleus
once i would said this ,
besides this i place another equally obvious confirmation of my view that opera is based on the same principles as our alexandrian culture
a style in which music is regarded as the servant , the text as the master , where music is compared with the body , the text with the soul ?
indeed , people would have let themselves be killed in order to learn more from him , if they had not been aware that tragic poets were just as dead as tragedy itself
but i ca not see two of the men 's leaders , castor , tamer of horses , and pollux , the fine boxer—they are both my brothers , whom my mother bore along with me
i will say this to you—
odysseus crawled and immediately gathered up
we must recognize how everything which comes into being must be ready for a painful destruction
their mother , had gone outside and summoned them
i could not catch a glimpse of her at all
she would throw up keel and mast
well , he won me over with his cunning
then antilochuspounced on him , like a dog leaping on a wounded fawn , which some hunter hits as it rushes from its den , loosening its limbs
for me to drink
but i swam on ,
let the one whose heart now drives himto fight with me step out as champion , your representative against lord hector
my child , could you direct me to the home
raise up your legs , you fine dancers , and better yet , stand on your heads !
a cloak and tunic and some clothes to wear
on an island , suffering great distress
whoever has experienced the delight of a socratic discovery and feels how this , in ever-widening rings , seeks to enclose the entire world of phenomena , will experience no spur capable of pushing him into existence more intense than the desire to complete that conquest and to weave a solid impenetrable net
i do not think his strength will help him , or his beauty , or that lovely armour—that will lie somewhere underneath the flood , buried in slime
dear brother , save me
below the sunlight , as i , too , did once ?
when they observed this , the two , in their amazement , went straight up to them
at evening the fine swineherd came to odysseus
like wild mountain boars taking on a confused mob of men and dogs attacking them—the beasts charge sideways , shattering trees around them , ripping out the roots , gnashing their teeth noisily , till someone hits them with his spear and takes away their lives—that 's how the shining bronze sounded on these two , as they moved out against the flying weapons
gods and warriors slept through the entire night
there 's an outer rim of jagged boulders
i am afraid that one of the phaeacians may outrun me , for in those many waves
your heads , your faces ,
we prepared and ate our evening meal
we made her finish it against her will
nor did i need to spend time at your house ,
coming up , patroclus struck him with his spear right on the jawbone , smashing through his teeth
on my way home
to go there and mingle with the suitors—
may gods grant you success of every kind ,
from dulichium , in fear of eurymachus
other gods had received their sacrifices , but he would failed to offer anything to her , a daughter of great zeus
achilles , greatly moved by what the gods had said , set off , running across the plain , now full of flooding water , with many lovely weapons of the slaughtered men floating there among their corpses
stranger , i speak his name with full respect
which both their hearts should find agreeable
of many warriors , when , once a king dies ,
in this , music is like geometric figures and numbers , which are the universal forms of all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all a priori [ before experience ] , although they are not abstract but vivid and always fixed
she was the youngest child of amphion ,
and zeus ' will then came to be fulfilled
because of something dionysus said
the truth is this—blessed gods do not love
but idomeneus went away to troy
he 's still alive , looking at the sunlight
and i do not even hear about his journey
it filled the sail , an excellent companion
it would be wrong , stranger , for me to disrespect a guest ,
then i think you most resemble artemis ,
sidonian experts in skilled handicrafts who made it had shaped it well
amazement gripped all those observing him to watch him organize those axes properly ,
while i was born deformed
no matter what his strength
will fix your eye
swift iris , with feet like wind , then said to achilles :
so they came forward one by one in turn ,
all the way back to aeolus ' island
savory smells curled up amid the smoke high into heaven
as phemius said this ,
but in his cave the wild cyclops had slaughtered him and made him his final meal
should be brave , so people born in future years
of his comrades ' bitter fate
if we start bickering , we ca not enjoy the meal , our excellent banquet
as i kept going , my heart
but why should an innocent man like himsuffer such misfortune , without doing wrong , just because of other people 's troubles ?
and as for food ,
then come to the wandering rocks , dread charybdis , and to scylla , whom men have never yet escaped
and giver of good things , how would you like
into a shining sky
this archilochus immediately startles us , alongside homer , through his cry of hate and scorn , through the drunken eruptions of his desire
to censure him for this is as impossible as it is to approve of his influence on the removal of instinct
apple trees—all with gleaming fruit—sweet figs
the man who wins , who comes off the victor , gets the womanand her property
he was all that eager to get married—
or hear their voices
i will tell you a sure sign you wo not forget—
earth flowed with blood
as a passenger and not the master
do not tell mewhat i should do
we do not have many cloaks
the old nurse went back to her room to rest ,
then , one after another , the proud suitors came
he hit hyrtius , the son of gyrtius , who led the courageous mysians
with these words , thetis left the cave
twelve distinguished kings are rulers here
odysseus prepares for his revenge
then she went away ,
whoever looks at a collection of folk songs , for example , des knaben wunderhorn [ the boy 's miraculous horn ] with this theory in mind will find countless examples of how the continually fecund melody spews out fiery showers of images all around
all around the boundless earth
on the tenth night ,
or inspired minstrels , who sing for our delight ?
the chorus of satyrs in the dithyramb is the saving fact of greek art
then in his hut he would rest again , leaving hector stretched out , face down in the dust
like a ship 's ribs , twelve of them in all
though a stranger , all by himself in that cadmean crowd , chariot fighter tydeus was not afraid
with these words , hermes went on his way , back to high olympus
another 's livelihood and pay him nothing
surely wide-thundering zeus for many years has shown a dreadful hate
when our will prevails
odysseus , that harsh rebuke of yours has stung my heart
you are our herald , tell the fair-haired nymph
your plan will benefit the two of us
got his revenge against his father 's killer ,
we know well enough your lovely armouris in trojan hands
a splendid meal of meat and sweetened wine
because i have gone through so much misery
a mist fell , clouding his eyes , but soon he breathed again
but there are lots of us who will stand against you
against the promontory on the left ,
and offers the best bridal gifts
coön was feverishly dragging his blood brother , iphidamas , out by the feet , crying for help to all the finest men
peiraeus , a famous spearman , then answered him and said :
zeus and the other gods kept me tied up
by our black ship
drink fit for gods and not yet mixed with water—
which no man yet has put beneath the yoke
if you send sarpedon home alive , take care some other god does not desireto send his dear son from the killing zone
now lies dead , something he well deserved
while she was alive ,
made high-minded polypheides his prophet ,
but their laments were useless
as she wept , lord odysseus heard her voice and lost himself in thought
you keep coming at me with such anger
but athena made sure their spear throws missed the mark
and yet i had to bear countless troubles ,
this is the apollonian dream state , in which the world of day veils itself and a new world , clearer , more comprehensible , more moving than the first , and yet shadow-like generates itself anew in a continuing series of changes before our eyes
their ears all caught his call
if zeus had not brought on a storm to end it
the two men ran up , panting , and grabbed his hands
what you have been looking forward to so long
to be married and got countless wedding gifts
her flesh melted—just as on high mountains
many men wished to volunteer
let sense of shame from all menfill your hearts
to learn about or hear of anything ,
these forces struggled , with terrific shouts across the dead man 's corpse
a place where i can leave this cold gray sea
his heart was angry with his dear mother , althea
the sea 's huge depths , in spite of all the gods
then someone must set off for the black ship
and so the messenger god , killer of argus ,
and then wise penelope began their conversation :
on his strong head he set a well-made helmet , with a horsehair crest which nodded menacingly
i think if we could capture these two things , achaeans would climb aboard their ships tonight
the servant women washed him , rubbed him down with oil , and dressed him in a handsome cloak and tunic
riding on the misty sea , lay very close to him
then you can hear both sirens as they sing
once he 's looked them over , he will lie down in their midst , like a shepherd with his sheep
and noble echephron led in the heifer by the horns , as aretus entered from an inner room ,
has truly been fulfilled !
a servant brought in a lovely golden jug ,
achilles seized him by the foot , then flung him in the river , shouting out in triumph— his words had wings :
or any rule of law , in hollow caves
daughter of great zeus who bears the aegis
to a sheltered spot , following what nausicaa ,
and i saw tityus , son of glorious earth ,
you came here wandering across the sea ?
its tremendous expansion , extending to all peoples and constantly increasing with new births , testifies to us how strong that artistic duality of nature is : which , to use an analogy , leaves its trace behind in the folk song just as the orgiastic movements of a people leave their traces in its music
a useful remedy—she got ambrosia ,
odysseus goes to the palace as a beggar
with these words , helen placed the garment in his hands
sweet slumber did not enfold this shepherd of his people , for his mind was disturbed with many worries
where lambs are born with horns and ewes give birth three times in one full year
instead , let each man carry on his courtship
now we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the womb of this socratic culture : optimism , with its delusion of limitless power
you are fighting against the trojans by yourself , in the front ranks of the crowd
that 's what she said
and die a pitiful death
when evening comes , i could wash in the river , get rid of all the sweat and then go back , return to ilion
he made me swear
helen , child of zeus , then answered priam :
son of atreus , other achaean leaders , priam and other noble trojans asked meto tell you what alexander has proposed , if that meets with your approval , an offeryou will want to hear
but those sailors ' hearts
the best wine you have got after the stock
the philosophy of wild and naked nature looks with the unconcealed countenance of truth at the myths of the homeric world dancing past it
the lovely goddess answered right away :
hera then fixed earrings in her pierced ear lobes , each with three gemstones , an enchanting glitter
in ancient wisdom , had not held them back
on his head odysseus set a hide cap , on the inside skillfully reinforced with leather thongs
i have got such a wretched fate !
but as it is , your fate was to be caught
hence , pressed down under this weight of contempt and eternal no 's , life must finally be experienced as something not worth desiring , as something worthless
of all men you are the best in making plans
and gave the argives wise and useful views
in the courtyard , old horseman peleus was burning thigh bones rolled in fat to thunder-loving zeus
then , as they were about to sprint in for the prize , ajax slipped in mid stride—for athena fouled him— right where the bellowing cattle had dropped their dung as they were slaughtered , the ones which swift achilles had killed in honour of patroclus
mighty agamemnon answered menelaus :
that 's the one whose daughter prevents the sad , unlucky man from leaving
from the beast 's head he cut off a single hair
for i have this cruel wound
she sent me off
each of them shouted out some words like these
a single beam of pine kept the gate securely closed
giving such a speech
we need to fight
worn down by sad old age , he would have no other child , no person to inherit all his property
paris led the second group , along with agenor and alcathous
dragged them underneath the rowing benches ,
you should consider what that means
at the home of wise ortilochus
only to the extent that the genius in the act of artistic creation is fused with that primordial artist of the world , does he know anything about the eternal nature of art , in that state , miraculously , as in the weird picture of fairy tales , he can turn his eyes and contemplate himself
so now , i end my anger
just as ravenous mountain wolves suddenly attackyoung goats or lambs and seize them from the flock , when in the mountains an inattentive shepherdlets them wander off—once the wolves see them , they attack at once , for those young lack the heart to fight— that 's how danaans then went after trojans , whose minds now turned to shameful flight , for they would lost their will to battle on
in the twentieth year , after going through
they would all come to a speedy end and find
then this man should soon take his final shot
they hauled in and furled the sails on their trim ship , moored it , and disembarked
i guarantee he will get a fine reward
companions and ships equipped with oars ,
by father zeus , athena , and apollo , i wish i were
inside the splendid chariot , and nestor 's son
send your companions and the ship ahead ,
odysseus quickly put on a cloak and tunic ,
even something small , is to be cherished
who would have welcomed me , then sent me off
let us add its most difficult question : what , from the point of view of living , does morality mean ?
the men said this in tears , addressing the king with tender words
stands the long-leafed olive tree
come , let 's go in your chariot , or at leastclasp him by the knees and beg for mercy
pale fear gripped my crewmen
the fine gate to the yard is awfully near ,
or eurytus of oechalia , warriors
in this drama there is already a surrender of individuality by entering into a strange nature
my lightning would have blasted both of you
how i am escorted from this place
he fell down on his knees , screaming
a younger man could talk so much like him
i wish i were as young as i was then ,
for they all hated paris , as they hated gloomy death
going out , eumelus ' mares were in the lead , but they must have run into some troubleout there , somewhere on the plain
so he jumped up and looked out at his native land
beside their dear father and good mother ,
the river bore orsilochus , king of many men , and orsilochus fathered great-hearted diocles , to whom were born twin sons ,
swift-footed orsilochus—in spacious crete
when all his armour was in place around his body , he moved forward , like some gigantic ares when he sets off to battle among warriors whom zeus , son of cronos , has stirred up for war , to fight with that war frenzy which consumes men 's hearts
the two of uscould run as quickly as the west wind 's blasts—men say they are the fastest thing there is—your fate still stays the same , to die in war , killed by a mortal and a god
i stayed there seven years and gathered up
the son of atreus shouted to his argives to get their armour on
there will be sorrow for you later ,
the middle of its back
but some remained— both sons of atreus , lord odysseus , nestor , idomeneus , and old horseman phoenix , each trying to console him in his painful grieving
her fine daughter , the youngest child she bore
white-armed goddess hera saw argives being slaughtered in the thick of battle
and that i wanted to avoid
the dogs and herdsmen
over the sea in their swift ship , set him
however , insofar as he interprets music in images , he is resting in the still tranquility of the sea of apollonian observation , no matter how much everything which he contemplates through that medium of music is moving around him , pushing and driving
the son of cronos has forbidden anyoneto assist the argives
with these words , glorious hector stretched his hands out for his son
but come , i will transform you ,
my own dear son fell there , antilochus , as strong as he was noble ,
or else i would have perished in these rooms
in horse-breeding argos , seeking to seduce
in his lofty home with hospitality
then brave sthenelusclimbed back into his chariot , grabbed the shining reins , and raced the strong horses back , keen to rejoin diomedes
when they joined up with the company of sentries , they did not find the captains of the watchmen sleeping
for then i will haveno other comfort , once you meet your death , except my sorrow
they present in the clarity of the real the very thing which music expresses in the universality of mere form
i will tell you about him
then they stopped , regrouping by their chariots , pale with fear , terrified
i called you here , each from your own city , not because i wished a large displayor needed it , but so you might help merescue trojan wives and little childrenfrom warrior achaeans
so they mourned for hector in his own house , though he was still alive—they thought he would not come back , he would not escape the battle fury of achaean hands
for our best men lie injured at the ships , crippled by arrows , spears , and swords
as they gazed upon the man , struck with wonder
to his heart it seemed she knew him and was standing there ,
who loved to go to battle in a chariot
in their hearts they must glow with pleasure for you always ,
but i could not lead my men off safely ,
tamer of horses , berthed their well-built ships
two herdsmen followed with him
and then to sacred sparta , seeking news
the gods had that much special love for you
the suitors were unhappy ,
and so was he
at once he sent an eagle , of all flying things the surest omen , a dark one , which people call black eagle , with wings as wide as doors on some rich man 's vaulted store house , one fitted well with bolts—that 's how wide this eagle spread its wings on either side , appearing on the right , speeding across the city
and had her share of recognition from the gods
with all these troubles in my heart
their master , in great pain ,
meriones killed a well-armed trojan warrior , laogonus , daring son of onetor , a priest of zeus at ida , honoured by his people as a god
then ino with the lovely ankles noticed him—
sends out another to maintain their count
child of aegis-bearing zeus , why have you come now ?
by force , or did you volunteer to give it up ,
old man , everything you say is true enough
and once you have had your meal , we will ask you who you are
what distinguishes the aryan conception is the lofty view of an active transgression as the essentially promethean virtue
he answered me and said :
the two men let the sweat dry on their tunics , standing in the seashore breeze
but we still must see and bear these things—
each of them prayed that he could go to bed with her
with ranks of soldiers
holding bull 's hide shields up high , with loud shouts , asius ' men came straight for the well-built wall , behind lord asius , iamenus , orestes , adamas , asius ' son , thoön , and oenomaus
in it the atrophied form of tragedy lived on , as a monument to tragedy 's extremely laborious and violent death
against each other , bring in their cattle ,
approaching ajax , the herald dropped the token in his palm
hera , why have youcome ?
only dare to be tragic men ; for you are to be redeemed
and ransacked priam 's city in the tenth
they sped off eagerly , dragging hector
measuring four acres and containing soil
i have been suffering trouble for a long time
but if fair-haired menelaus kills alexander , then let the trojans hand back helen , with all her property , and compensateachaeans with something suitable , which future ages will remember
but i was afraid you might be angry ,
as for me , i am readyto give every gift which lord odysseus promised you in your hut yesterday
but when i wish to hide my thoughts from gods , do not you go digging after them , or pestering me for every detail
alas—sarpedon , dearest of all men , is fated now to die , killed by patroclus ,
that was the song the famous minstrel sang
the wonderfully crafted metal rang out loudly
and with a sure aim let the arrow fly
resentment lingers in his chest , until one dayhe acts on it
with those two gods of art , apollo and dionysus , we connect our recognition that in the greek world there exists a huge contrast , in origins and purposes , between visual ( plastic ) arts , the apollonian , and the non-visual art of music , the dionysian
then the killer of argus , zeus ' messenger ,
by this time , helios had just begun to strike the fields ,
and hold it on my shoulder with one hand
they lashed the rope ends to the mast as well ,
the fawn , as he throttled it , and the fawn
will reach my native land
but i will make this threat : i will take your prize , fair-cheeked briseis
there were no harbours fit for ships to ride or coves , but jutting headlands , rocks , and cliffs—at that point odysseus felt his knees and spirit give way ,
carved out of pine
when he met her , great-hearted tydeus ' son charged , lunging with his sharp spear at aphrodite
then you may enjoy some , too , if you will drink
once he grew up and longed for his own land
i told him to return back to the ships , once he would saved them from consuming fire , and not face up to hector man to man
but now , you should all eat , so we can start the fight
that 's no help to us
closely observed , this fatal influence of the opera on music is seen to coincide exactly with the universal development of modern music ; the optimism lurking in the genesis of the opera and in the character of the culture thereby represented , has , with alarming rapidity , succeeded in divesting music of its dionysian-cosmic mission and impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character : a change comparable to the metamorphosis of the aeschylean man into the cheerful alexandrian
because of this complete transformation in public language he also made the new comedy possible
already down in hades ' home ?
glaucus , why would a man like you speak outso arrogantly ?
i would be ashamed to do it
that always happens , each and every day
who cares about apollo 's scarf and staff ?
whose young have been carried off by country folk before they are fully fledged
so medon was the one who set their ranks in order
this lofty metaphysical delusion is inherent in scientific research and leads it over and over again to its limits , at which point it must turn itself into art , something which is really predictable in this mechanical process
their roosting place , and find out they have been welcomed by a dreadful bed , that 's how those women held their heads all in a row , with nooses fixed around their necks , so they would have a pitiful death
in those centuries when the greek body flourished and the greek soul bubbled over with life , perhaps there were endemic raptures , visions , and hallucinations which entire communities , entire cultural bodies , shared
under men 's and horses ' feet the earth rang ominously
which helios owns , who gives men such joy
so i split up
in all these things i am telling you the truth
you seem to be a vagrant , just like me—
ajax , my friend , come here
a song about the glorious deeds of warriors ,
it manifests the same characteristic features i already derived out of the idea of the un-dionysian : it fights against dionysian wisdom and art ; it strives to dissolve myth ; it places an earthy consonance in place of a metaphysical consolation , indeed a particular deus ex machina , namely , the god of machines and crucibles , that is , the force of nature , recognized and used in the service of a higher egoism ; it believes in correcting the world through knowledge , a life led by scientific knowledge , and thus is really in a position to confine the individual man in the narrowest circle of problems which can be solved , inside which he can cheerfully say to life : i want you
the goddess spoke and handed him the veil
if you want some action , since sleep has not come to you here either , go with me
where these two foaming rivers meet
you will find that hard to do
or is in hades ' home , already dead
keep looking on , and hold yourself in check
but his heart would find no joy until he would entered the bloody mouth of war
are lying uncared for in odysseus ' house
i lost my noble husband—a man
this dynamic of the tragic chorus is the original dramatic phenomenon : to see oneself transformed before one 's eyes and now to act as if one really had entered another body , another character
peleus 's son went back to his well-balanced ships and huts , along with patroclus , menoetius ' son , and friends
if i learn he 's dead and gone , i will come back
who have been courting her within the halls ,
and some land , too , within shouting distance
just like those times two winds blow in from thrace— north wind and west wind suddenly spring upand lash the fish-filled seas—black waves at once rise up , then fling seaweed in piles along the shoreline— so spirits in achaean chests were now cast down
and comes to see his mother 's family home
would quickly take their vengeance on these men
the very ones he wished to choose himself
how in hephaestus ' house they first had sex
to their delight , the gods release him from disease , that 's how odysseus rejoiced when he could see
who paid an excellent price
neither ares nor athena , who incite warriors to battle , if they would seen that fight , would have disparaged it , not even if they would been intensely angry
aegisthus then accompanied him home—
where are your swift lethal arrows and the bowphoebus apollo gave you ?
i am going to address the son of peleus , but you other argives pay attention—let every one of you mark my words well
come then , tell me this—
like many men the black earth nourishes
once she reached her father 's splendid palace ,
he thinks he will never suffer any harm
i throw further than any other man
it seems telemachus really does intend
i wo not wash myself in front of you ,
in order , then , to form a true estimate of the dionysian capacity of a people , we must not only think of their music , but also just as necessarily of their tragic myth , as the second witness of this capacity
my fighting power grows
do not do that , even if the second is the greater king
aeneas , king of men , would have perished there , if aphrodite , zeus ' daughter , had not seen him right away
i could escape destruction
resourceful odysseus , laertes ' son ,
she spoke out once more to her well-groomed housemaids :
his father 's vanished , and there 's no one else
at priam 's words , the crowd moved back , making room
for the minds of gods , who live forever ,
expert at war shouts , to let you go back ,
i have done good things for you
flushed out mountain goats , food for us to eat
queen circe 's told me what to do
the most magnificent temple lay in ruins
that question whether their constantly strong desire for beauty , feasts , festivities , and new cults arose out of some lack , deprivation , melancholy , or pain
then athena , goddess with the glittering eyes , replied to zeus :
that oath i swore ,
i would stuffed in each man 's ears and loosed my ropes
and removed the sharp sword from his shoulders
the morning frost may be too much for me—
straight through—so leocritus fell on his face ,
as he fell , powerful elephenor , son of chalcodon , courageous leader of the abantes , seized his feet , and started pulling him beyond the range of weapons , eager to strip him of his armour quickly
clasping his hand , she spoke to him :
that 's not the reason
one made of horn and one of ivory
he went up to greet his master , kissed his head , both his handsome eyes , his two hands , then burst into tears
and that 's the reason
the entire plain was filled with men on foot and in their chariots and with gleaming bronze
but now the trojans have your lovely armour , all your glittering bronze
with words of reassurance :
and secure it quickly with a knot ,
on those companions of odysseus ,
a massive axe , well suited to his grip , and made of two-edged bronze
the beast gets here as quickly as it can ,
i will give you clothes and send a favouring wind
you led me far from father and my friends , then sold me off in sacred lemnos
the son of atreus moved through the troops and gave out many orders
the bronze point , slicing under his tongue , smashed through his teeth
dear child , come tell me who this man is , shorter by a head than agamemnon , son of atreus
a herd of seals—they are the offspring of the lovely daughter of the sea and swim up out of the gray water
he granted part of it , part he denied
quite generally , only music , placed beside the world , can give us an idea of what is meant by the justification of the world as an aesthetic phenomenon
the fiery effects are , to be sure , imitated with a high degree of realism , but the ideas and emotional effects are not in the slightest way imbued with the spirit of art
he 's near by , planning a disastrous fate
were hideous , as heads were smashed apart
then alcimedon , springing up into that fast chariot , quickly grabbed the reins and whip
he struck that round leather shield
sleep , king of all menand gods , if you have ever listened to what i say , obey me now
the men thus occupied , agamemnon did not forget the challenge he would made earlier to achilles
in view of his critically productive creativity it must have often struck him that he must be bringing alive in drama the opening of anaxagoras 's text , the first lines of which go as follows : in the beginning everything was a confused mixture , but then came reason and created order
that 's the way the gods have spun the threadsfor wretched mortal men , so they live in pain ,
or when , in the same way , the cunning witch
you drunken sot , dog-eyed , deer-timid coward , you are never strong enough within yourself to arm for war alongside other comrades , or venture with achaea 's bravest on a raid
in that ditch many swift horseslost their master 's chariots when poles snapped at the end
odysseus had given him a keen-edged sword
lie there , among the fish
with his hand he grabbed and squeezed his wounded arm , still painful from being hit by teucer 's arrow , as he would attacked him on that high defensive wall
no fruit gets destroyed or dies in winter time
shrewd telemachus began by speaking to the other two :
knowing nothing of the preparations
whatever came to hand
of arethusa , drinking its dark water
what purpose ( that 's the question we need to ask at this point ) could euripides ' intention to ground drama solely on the un-dionysian have had , if we assume its implementation had the very highest ideals ?
at persephone 's groves , on the level beach where tall poplars grow , willows shed their fruit , right beside deep swirling oceanus
the two lay down together on the bed
and brushed aside a tear—he did so casually to hide it from eumaeus
then peiraeus , the well-known spearman , approached , leading the stranger
the killing of their sons and brothers
war-loving menelaus noticed alexander striding there , his troops bunched up in ranks behind him , and he rejoiced , like a famished lion finding a large carcass— antlered stag or wild goat—and devouring it at once , though fierce young hunters and swift dogs attack
i will leave you the horses , so i can fight
he robbed teucer of that triumph by snapping the fine bow 's tightly twisted string , just as teucer was lining up a shot at hector
that god had given it to lord zeus , son of cronos
the troops kept dying ,
who had endured so much , overjoyed to see it ,
father zeus , you wo not get angry with me for what i say , will you ?
to those nymphs they call the naiads
in its unfettered rush it demonstrates a natural power of the sort we meet , to our shuddering surprise , only in the very greatest instinctive powers
and , in a multitude of enemies ,
then helen , goddess among women , picked out one , the largest and most beautifully embroidered—
responded to with such delight
all the bronze and gold and well-worked iron ,
a guest remembers all his life the man
gathering plentiful supplies and gold ,
ranged like that , the two groups will stand against each other
she recognized her brother-in-law at once , as he kept busy in the war where men win glory , for he was her brother and her husband 's , too
and he returned , bringing the achaeans ,
eumaeus , may father zeus treat you as well
athena spoke , and pale fear gripped the men
when she said this ,
by a large swell , and as he quickly looked ahead ,
when trojans reached the scaean gates and oak tree , they stopped there , to wait for their remaining men
but a cunning man , though he 's got worse horses , keeps his eye on that turning point , cuttingthe pillar close
i would left her still alive when i set off
intelligence , and planning , we escaped
the father of gods and men replied :
around his chest he put on the body armour of achilles ,
in fact , i would advise you to retreat , get back to your companions
much more famous than this political explanation of the chorus is a w schlegel 's idea
people heard about it all at once and came in
you are too cruel
that 's what one calls a world !
the best place i could land—it was free of rocks , and there was shelter from the wind , as well
he had no clue of what zeus really meant , his plan to load on them , trojans and danaans both , still more suffering , more cries of sorrow , through war 's brutality
who are these people ?
where i stood , i could see smoke rising
meanwhile , silver-footed thetis reached hephaestus ' home
they reached the fields of sunny ithaca
glaucus , my friend , you warrior among men , now you must really show yourself a spearman , a true courageous fighter
it is from this abyss that the german reformation came forth ; and in its chorales the future tune of german music resounded for the first time
he kept quiet , looking at his father , always watching him
to draw the sharp sword by my sturdy thigh
when i would not allow him into battleor to display himself , that time he cameto thebes alone , far from his achaeans , in the middle of all those cadmeans , i told him to be quiet at the palace feast
two of the finest men then came at one another in the middle groundbetween the armies , both prepared for combat— aeneas , anchises ' son , and godlike achilles
antilochus , if you are telling me to give eumelussome other prize inside my huts , i will do it
because he sees so much more around him
it 's like what the cyclops did , when our companions
inside a woman 's chest
antilochus jabbed his sharp spear
she pinned the robe around her breast with golden brooches
as for me , i had no doubts ,
so i answered him—
on the threshold , gripping the bronze spear in her fist
do not slow down or stand there sad at heart
the steep height at malea , storm winds caught him
which carry her as fast as stormy blasts of wind across the ocean seas and endless tracts of land
patted telemachus with his hand , and said :
some years ago laertes
no other man can rival him in this
see , men and women of troy , come and see—look on hector , if , while he was still alive , you would rejoice when he came back from war , for he was a great joy to all our cityand its people
but there 's no way men can go on forever without sleep
then from the polished wagon they brought in that priceless ransom for hector 's head , leaving there two cloaks and a thickly woven tunic , so achillescould wrap up the corpse before he gave it back for priam to take home
then a man approached , someone from far away ,
to these proud suitors and the violent acts
but they did not bark
looking at hera with a fearful scowl , zeus said :
then i moved up and stood at cyclops ' side ,
were meant to reassure him :
i do not want to take these women 's lives with a clean death
then they armed themselves
from what i know ,
making them forget their troubles
the man i trusted most and cherished
in them , for the first time , the tearing apart of the principii individuationis [ the individualizing principle ] becomes an artistic phenomenon
he gave them to the suitors
he collapsed in the dust , like a poplar tree , one growing in a large well-watered meadow , from whose smooth trunk the branches grow up to the top , until a chariot builder 's bright axe topples it , bends the wood , to make wheel rims for a splendid chariot , letting the wood season by the riverbank
the achaeans all grew silent , ashamed to duck the challenge , afraid to answer it
then this man wo not be shooting any more
just as man-killing ares sets off to battle accompanied by his son terror , just as strong , as fearless , who makes any man afraid , no matter how courageous he may be—the two of themsetting out from thrace , having armed themselves to fight ephyreans or brave phlegyans , giving glory to one of them , without listening to either side— that 's how meriones and idomeneus , leaders of men , set off to battle , fully armed in glittering bronze
he urges other men to do the same
no man 's strength matched his
i will show you your course and tell you each sign to look for , so you will not suffer , or , thanks to vicious plans of sea and land ,
menelaus , skilled at war shouts , at once
that 's idiotic , like a faithful promisebetween men and lions
had contemplated all these things with wonder ,
to cut down the heifer
you have come back from the fight
had not been buried in the broad-tracked earth
in the killing zone let each man shame the rest
because he was the king of all phaeacians
and well-tended ships , by the meeting places ,
i speak out my holy laughter to myself
in the dionysian dithyramb man is aroused to the highest intensity of all his symbolic capabilities
just as a wild mountain boar , trusting its own strength , stands firm against a mob , a crowd of men who chase it in some lonely place , with hair bristling along its back , its eyes lit up , like fire , gnashing its teeth ferociously , eager to toss dogs and men aside—that 's just the way the famous spearman idomeneus stood , without backing off , as swift aeneas came at him
the trojans can expect from zeus more sorrows , more disasters
in comparison with music , each appearance is far more a mere metaphor
because in his heart all through that immortal night anxious thoughts about his father kept him awake
hence , confronted by the greeks , people have been ashamed and afraid
a matter for the men , especially me ,
the strong-hooved mules , and climbed up by herself
but now , with filthy clothing on my skin ,
that 's when those timbers first came into view
their own rich flocks , to feast the lady 's friends
he kicked ajax behind the knee , taking out his leg
leading these men came ares along with fearful strife , bringing war 's pitiless and murderous confusion
then he threw his sharp spear from his massive hand
was warning me a man might soon attack ,
whipping it around , menelaus hurled the helmet in among well-armed achaeans
it 's difficult to reconcile the idea of odysseus being far from the sea with the mention of his people ( ie , those in ithaca ) living well all around him , unless , as some legends have it , he leaves ithaca and becomes a ruler somewhere else
but odysseus , angry at his true-hearted wife ,
many died for helen 's sake , and then
but the sword shattered into three or four pieces , falling from his hand
at the first place you reach in ithaca ,
is anchored over there , close to the fields
keeps me in his house against my will ,
his heart was growling
tragedy closes with a sound which could never come from the realm of apollinian art
that 's what appropriate for those who die
with powerful king alcinous leading them ,
then the sons of nestor went into action
but that 's not how things happened to turn out—
they set off together , through the wide achaean army 's crowded ranks
on their behalf , strong and mighty alcinous
with these firm orders , he dismissed the men , who moved off , heavy hearted , along the shore of the restless sea
and as for us ,
the chariot axle underneath got sprayed with blood
so with his huge strides , he kept moving up and down the decks along the ships
he turned himself into a hairy lion ,
white-armed hera did not answer him
i am not that unhappy
i regret that , on the basis of the most recent german music , i began to tell stories of the german character , just as if that character might be about to discover itself , to find itself again
holy elis owed him an enormous debt— four prize-winning horses with their chariot , which had come to elis to compete , intent on racing for a tripod
and others will hate to speak to me as peers , in public claiming full equality with me
i will tell you now in detail
i will explain it to you
his dear nurse eurycleia answered him :
who gets angry with me first
that unlucky guest , my son , if , indeed ,
casts out some bait with his long pole to snare
achaeans and trojans were elated , full of hope that wretched war would end
but when i would set out , like a fool i would left
giving them their orders , an old man 's right
antinous in his heart
as the sun went down , the splendid presents were brought in , carried to alcinous ' home by worthy heralds
and ask him questions about everything
once they have taken on supplies of water
i am like mortal men
even if the others are all slaughteredby achaean ships , you need have no fearthat you will be killed
for those phaeacians , her own countrymen ,
to drive the cattle in for their own meals
bright-eyed athena then said to apollo :
the late-setting bootes , and the great bear ,
let me tell you something—of all those who came to troy with atreus ' sons , you are the most disgraceful
now find it pleasing for the wise odysseus
where am i now ?
you too , old man , would make up a story
this is a man
seeing the smoke , my mind and heart considered going down
but come , tell me—and speak truthfully—how many days do you require to bury godlike hector , so i can stop that longand keep the troops in check ?
forty black ships came with elephenor
is a great symbol which i made myself
still , i do not expect
euphemus , son of god-nurtured troezenus , son of ceos , led ciconian spearmen
though i was on my way to hades ,
but their spirits fell , as they remembered
wise penelope then answered him :
son of polybus , began to shout to them ,
then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
would make him keep his distance for three months
then athena , goddess with the glittering eyes , thought of one more thing
hermes , in his turn , gave it to king pelops , the chariot racer , who passed the staff to atreus , the people 's leader
then she can marry the one who offers most
but cronos ' son did not grant his wish
of deep black wool
the conference over , the two parted
will not allow the quiver and the bow
the first pieces he had cut
where , like a god , he sits and sips his wine
he would come from fertile paeonia , their best man in a fight after asteropaeus , and his fall filled warrior asteropaeus with sorrow
it 's certainly the case , as true as that my son was once alive , he never once neglected in our homethe gods who hold olympus
have planned some dismal fate for him
but all you other sceptre-bearing kings
ends in a swift death
by the fourth day he had completed all this work
and rising sun , as well as all who dwell
of enemies who keep on butchering
can the deep hatred against modernism , reality , and modern ideas go any further than it does in your artists ' metaphysics , which would sooner believe in nothingness or the devil than in the here and now ?
sing out loud , or giggle softly to himself ,
tomorrow morning idaios should go to the hollow ships , to tell the sons of atreus , both agamemnon and menelaus , what alexander has just now proposed , the very man whose cause launched this dispute
the colts who bring on dawn
that made queen hera angry
to whom zeus has given honour and glory , it 's difficult for me to see preciselywhat each of you is doing—this conflictrages on so fiercely
olive , pear , or garden plot in all the field—
he told me all about achaean plans
that is none other than zeus ' daughter ,
as long as phoebus apollo held the aegis steady in his hands , on both sides weapons hit their mark— men kept on dying
for i will still grant glory to the trojans , to keep on killing till they reach the ships , at sunset , when sacred darkness comes
in a silver basin , so they could wash their hands
with her encouragement , to sail back home—
just as he did his true-born sons
of its resources and claim he wo not come back
where cimmerians have their lands and city ,
those counselors and leaders , were not so wise
men who roam about , when they need a meal ,
the cruel point kept going
he 's had bad luck , but in his appearance
nastes and amphimachus , noble sons of nomionwere their leaders
strong antiphates , out of a meeting ,
in the morning , agamemnon , king of men ,
from the great fight—we can be sure of that—
with respect to greek tragedy , which , of course , comes to us only as a drama of words , i have even suggested that that incongruity between myth and word can easily seduce us into considering it shallower and more empty of meaning than it is , and thus to assume a more superficial action than it must have had according to the testimony of the ancients
many achaeans are hatching evil plans—
acamas and warlike peirous led the thracians , those men bounded by the hellespont 's strong flow
achaeans all will celebrate his fame
the bedpost , i used an augur to bore out
meanwhile , circe had been acting kindly
that 's the man i was , back then , but now let younger men competein events like these
once he would heard these words , eumaeus went and stood beside odysseus , then spoke—his words had wings :
and violence reach up to iron heaven
even if they wish to stay for fair-throned dawn , they can not not wear me down , for i am a man
if any of them fears and honours us
in this dark night
then lovely polycaste , youngest daughter
when hector saw that teucer 's arrow shot had missed , he called in a loud voice to trojans and to lycians :
messenger hermes , killer of argus , answered priam :
to all the gods who hold mount olympus
but seek to win them over with nice words , even though you will surely not convince them ,
trojans created a commotion , totally confused , as they rushed in all at once , to gaze astonished at the terrible destruction those two men did before returning to the hollow ships
as penelope said this , telemachus gave a mighty sneeze—it echoed
trojans had summoned an assembly by priam 's palace gates
would be testing lord odysseus
so striking up to now , i will make them dim
after menelaus spoke , he stripped the body , then gave its bloody armour to his comrades
one of those heroic men who perished
and only after the spirit of knowledge is taken right to its limits and its claim to universal validity destroyed by the establishment of that limit would it be possible to hope for a re-birth of tragedy
i can foretell events much better than you can
artemis began a war about this beast , that battle between the curetesand the aetolians , courageous men fighting for the boar 's head and bristly hide
despicable paris , handsomest of men , but woman-mad seducer
i beg you by olympian zeus and themis ,
was driven in , and brave telemachus ' comrades
and you , my child , you will follow with me , to some place where you will be put to workat menial tasks , slaving for a cruel master
then some arrogant trojan , leaping up onto the tomb of famous menelaus , will shout : amay agamemnon 's angeralways end like this
war-loving menelaus felt pity for these two , seeing them die
received nine goats by lot
hector picked up a rock lying before the gates , thick at its base but tapering sharply on the top
it seems to methat another team is now in front , with another charioteer approaching
so he stayed home with his wife , cleopatra , the attractive daughterof the lady with the lovely ankles , maripessa , daughter of euenusand ides , strongest of all men then alive
that 's how much she 's honoured from the heart
where must tragedy come from ?
on the front , a dog held in its forepaws
singing for the suitors at their banquets
a man the blessed gods must hate
keep wandering on the sea until you meet
from the gods or mortal men , but sail off
tell me now , you muses living on olympus , how the fire first got tossed onto achaean ships
he spoke to hera , his sister and his wife :
if zeus grants me the strength to take your life , i will not abuse your corpse in any way
but no man gets his life back , not by theft or plunder , once it has flown out from him ,
to push forward with that reasoning and to separate true knowledge from appearance and error seem to the socratic man to be the noblest , even the single truly human vocation , just as that mechanism of ideas , judgments , and conclusions has been valued , from socrates on , as the highest activity and the most most admirable gift of nature , above all other faculties
a god who knows the depths of every sea ,
they heard and carried out his orders , eagerly and quickly harnessing swift horses
onto the ground , and treat him like a sow
after he would said this ,
and bathe a man the same age as your master
but come now , let all of you
as he keeps wandering from place to place
for all the pain i feel , i will suppress the heartwithin my chest , as i must
he 's in a distant land , alive or dead
now i would like to give that mixing bowl to you
to be a thing of wonder , not like man
so be on your way
for nine full days
i stayed there with him an entire year
aeneas picked up a rock , a heavy lift , which no two men now alive could do , although he managed it with ease all by himself
but hermes did not find odysseus in the cave—
just a phantom royal persephone has sent
son of fiery-hearted tydeus , why talk like that ?
it lay below the others , shining like a star
i could later pray to zeus , cronos ' son ,
no one thought to pull the ash spear from his thigh , so he could walk
his right hand held a gold cup full of honey wine , so they might pour libations before setting out
since it gives you pleasure , kill us , but do in the light of day
for as he turned , he tripped against a shield rim , the one he carried , which extended to his feet and protected him from spears
i am issuing no orders to you
the noble goddess went to them
fulfils whatever he has in his heart
as some man i just met on my way here
thetis did not forget the promise to her son
on which the lawless monster polyphemus
meanwhile , other gods and warrior charioteers , all conquered by sweet sleep , slept the whole night through
but no phaeacian will detain you here ,
after this last flourishing , myth collapsed , its leaves grew pale , and soon the mocking lucians of antiquity grabbed up the flowers , scattered around by all winds , colourless and withered
by the sea lie carians , paeonians , with their curved bows , lelegians , caucones , god-like pelasgians
his pitiless heart replied :
to quarrel with each other
beside the gate of dreams
though he stayed behind , he must have given you strict orders as you left , wouldo not return to me , horseman patroclus , at the hollow ships , until you have slashed blood all over man-killing hector 's tunicfrom his own chest
that 's massive ajax , achaea 's bulwark
next you will reach the island of thrinacia , where helios ' many cattle graze ,
first listen to what greek folk wisdom expresses about this very life which spreads out before you here with such inexplicable serenity
on the other hand , many a being more nobly and delicately endowed by nature , though he may have gradually become a critical barbarian in the manner described , might have something to say about the unexpected as well as totally unintelligible effect that a successful performance of lohengrin , for example , had on him -- except that perhaps there was no helpful interpreting hand to guide him ; so the incomprehensibly different and altogether incomparable sensation that thrilled him remained isolated and , like a mysterious star , became extinct after a short period of brilliance
the cicones broke through , overpowering
and found herself someone to marry
nestor spoke this prayer , and pallas athena heard him
but gods do not give men everything at once
for both of you
all the same age as brave telemachus
he hit a good fighting man , comrade to aeneas , great-hearted deïcoön , son of pergasus , whom trojans honoured as they did king priam 's sons , for he was quick to take his place among the best , the men who do their fighting at the very front
it 's not at all appropriate for a manspattered with blood and dirt to offer prayers to the son of cronos , lord of the black clouds
would you young ladies move some distance off ,
