start at the point where agamemnon , son of atreus , that king of men , quarreled with noble achilles .
which of the gods incited these two men to fight ? that god was apollo , son of zeus and leto .
for agamemnon had dishonoured the god 's priest , chryses , who 'd come to the ships to find his daughter , chryseis , bringing with him a huge ransom . in his hand he held up on a golden staff the scarf sacred to archer god apollo . he begged achaeans , above all the army 's leaders , the two sons of atreus :
menelaus , agamemnon , sons of atreus , all you well-armed achaeans , may the gods on olympus grant you wipe out priam 's city , and then return home safe and sound.release my dear child to me . take this ransom .
honour apollo , far-shooting son of zeus .
take the generous ransom . displeased , agamemnon dismissed chryses roughly : old man , do n't let me catch you by our hollow ships , sneaking back here today or later on .
who cares about apollo 's scarf and staff ? i 'll not release the girl to you , no , not beforeshe 's grown old with me in argos , far from home , working the loom , sharing my bed .
if you want to get home safely , do n't anger me .
the old man , afraid , obeyed his words , walked off in silence , along the shore by the tumbling , crashing surf.some distance off , he prayed to lord apollo , leto 's fair-haired child :
god with the silver bow , protector of chryse , sacred cilla , mighty lord of tenedos , sminthean apollo , hear my prayer : if i 've ever pleased you with a holy shrine , or burned bones for you— bulls and goats well wrapped in fat—grant me my prayer . force the danaansto pay full price for my tears with your arrows . so chryses prayed .
phoebus apollo heard him.he came down from olympus top enraged , carrying on his shoulders bow and covered quiver , his arrows rattling in anger against his arm . so the god swooped down , descending like the night.he sat some distance from the ships , shot off an arrow— the silver bow reverberating ominously .
first , the god massacred mules and swift-running dogs , then loosed sharp arrows in among the troops themselves .
for nine days apollo rained death down upon the troops.on the tenth , achilles summoned an assembly .
the meeting came to order.swift-footed achilles rose to speak : son of atreus , i fear we 're being beaten back , forced home , if we are n't all going to be destroyed right here , with war and plague killing off achaeans .
come now , let 's ask some prophet , priest , interpreter of dreams—for dreams , too , come from zeus—a man who might say why apollo is so angry , whether he faults our prayers and offerings , whether somehow he 'll welcome sacrificial smokefrom perfect lambs and goats , then rouse himself and release us from this plague .
then calchas , thestor 's son , stood up before them all , the most astute interpreter of birds , who understood present , future , past .
his skill in prophecy , apollo 's gift , had led achaean ships to troy.he addressed the troops , thinking of their common good :
achilles , friend of zeus , you ask me to explainapollo 's anger , the god who shoots from far . and i will speak .
but first you listen to me.swear an oath that you will freely help me in word and deed .
i think i may provoke someone who wields great power over argives , a man who is obeyed by everyone.an angry king overpowers lesser men .
will you protect me ?
in response to calchas , swift-footed achilles said :
state what your powers tell you .
by apollo , whom zeus loves , to whom you , calchas , pray in prophesy to the danaans , i swear this—while i live to look upon the light of day , no achaean will raise violent hands against you , no , not even if you name agamemnon , who claims he 's by far the best achaean .
encouraged , the wise prophet then declared :
apollo does not fault us for prayers or offerings , but for his priest , disgraced by agamemnon , who did not free his daughter and take ransom . that 's why the archer god has brought disaster , and will bring still more . he wo n't remove this wretched plague from the danaans , until we hand back bright-eyed chryseis , give her to her beloved father , freely , without ransom , and offer holy sacrifice at chryse .
if we will carry out all that , we may change apollo 's mind , appease him .
so he spoke and sat back down .
then , atreus ' son , wide-ruling , mighty agamemnon , stood up before them , incensed , spirit filled with huge black rage.eyes blazing fire , he rounded first on calchas :
prophet of evil , when have you ever saidgood things to me ?
you love to predict the worst , always the worst !
you never show good news .
now , in prophecy to the danaans , you say archer apollo brings us pain because i was unwilling to acceptfine ransom for chryses ' daughter , chryseis .
but i have a great desire to take her home.in fact , i want her more than clytaemnestra , the wife i married . chryseis is just as good in her shape , physique , intelligence , or work.still , i 'm prepared to give her back , if that 's best.i want the people safe , not all killed off.but then you 'll owe me another prize.i wo n't be the only argive left without a gift .
that would be entirely unfair to me . you all can see my spoils are going elsewhere .
at that point , swift-footed achilles answered the king :
noble son of atreus , most acquisitive of men , how can brave achaeans give you a prize now ?
there are none left for us to pass around .
we 've divided up what we allotted , loot from captured towns we devastated.for men to make a common pile againwould be most unfair .
send the girl back now , as the god demands .
should zeus ever grantwe pillage troy , a city rich in goods , we 'll give you three or four times as much .
achilles , you 're a fine man , like a god.but do n't conceal what 's in your heart.you 'll not trick me or win me with your words.you intend to keep your prizes for yourself , while the army takes my trophy from me .
that 's why you tell me to give chryseis back.let achaeans give me another prize , equal in value , something i 'll enjoy . if not , then i 'll take a prize myself by force , something from you or ajax or odysseus . the man i visit is going to be enraged .
but let 's postpone discussion of all this.let 's drag a black ship to the sacred sea ,
let 's have as leader some wise counselor—idomeneus , ajax , godlike odysseus , or you , peleus 's son , most eminent of all , so with a sacrifice we may appease the god who shoots from far away .
you insatiable creature , quite shameless.how can any achaean obey you willingly— join a raiding party or keep fightingwith full force against an enemy ? i did n't come to battle over herebecause of trojans .
i have no fight with them.they never stole my bulls or horsesor razed my crops in fertile phthia , where heroes grow .
but you , great shameless man , we came with you , to please you , to win honour from the trojans—for you , dog face , and for menelaus.you do n't consider this , do n't think at all .
you threaten now to confiscate the prizei worked so hard for , gift from achaea 's sons.when we achaeans loot some well-built trojan town , my prizes never match the ones you get.the major share of war 's fury rests on me .
but when we hand around the battle spoils , you get much larger trophies .
worn out in war , i reach my ships with something fine but small.so i 'll return home now to phthia.it 's far better to sail back in my curved ships.i do n't fancy staying here unvalued , to pile up riches , treasures just for you .
to that , agamemnon , king of men , shot back :
i 'll not beg you to stay on my account .
i have others around to honour me , especially all-wise zeus himself .
of all the kings zeus cherishes , it ’ s youi hate the most .
so what if you 're strong ? some god gave you that .
i do n't like you or care about your rage.but i 'll make this threat : i 'll take your prize , fair-cheeked briseis .
you 'll see just how much i 'm the better man.and others will hate to speak to me as peers , in public claiming full equality with me .
as agamemnon spoke , peleus ' son , achilles , was overwhelmed with anguish , heart torn two ways , debating in his shaggy chest what he should do : should he draw out the sharp sword on his thigh , incite the crowd , kill atreus ' son , or suppress his rage , control his fury ?
as he argued in his mind and heart , he slid his huge sword part way from its sheath.at that moment , athena came down from heaven .
white-armed hera sent her .
at once he recognized pallas athena , the dreadful glitter in her eyes .
achilles spoke—his words had wings .
child of aegis-bearing zeus , why have you come now ?
do you wish to see how overbearing agamemnon is ?
i 'll tell you where all this is going to lead— that arrogance will soon cost him his life .
white-armed hera sent me .
she loves you both alike , cares equally .
do n't draw your sword.fight him with words , so he becomes disgraced.for i say to you , and this will happen , because of agamemnon 's arrogance some day gifts three times greater than this girlwill be set down before you . swift-footed achilles answered athena :
goddess , men should follow your instructions , though angry in their hearts .
it 's better so .
obeying athena 's words , achilles relaxed his huge fist on the silver hiltand pushed the massive sword back in its scabbard . athena then returned to heaven , home of zeus , who bears the aegis , and the other gods .
achilles turned again on agamemnon , atreus ' son , with harsh abuse , his anger still unabated :
you drunken sot , dog-eyed , deer-timid coward , you 're never strong enough within yourself to arm for war alongside other comrades , or venture with achaea 's bravest on a raid.to you that smells too much like death .
you 'd much prefer to stroll around throughout the wide achaean army , to grab gifts from a man who speaks against you .
a king who gorges on his own people ! you lord it over worthless men .
son of atreus , this would be your last offence.i 'll tell you , swear a great oath on this point , by this sceptre , which will never sprout leaves and shoots again , since first ripped awayfrom its mountain stump , nor bloom any more , now that bronze has sliced off leaf and bark.this sceptre achaea 's sons take in hand whenever they do justice in zeus ' name.an oath on this has power .
on this i swear—the time will come when achaea 's sonsall miss achilles , a time when , in distress , you 'll lack my help , a time when hector , that man killer , destroys many warriors.then grief will tear your hearts apart , because you shamed achaea 's finest man .
so the son of peleus spoke , throwing to the ground the sceptre with the golden studs .
then he sat down , directly facing furious agamemnon .
sweeter than honey the words flowed from his tongue .
in his own lifetime two generations of mortal menhad come and passed away , all those born and raised with him so long ago in sacred pylos.now he ruled a third generation of his people .
alas , this is great sorrow for achaeans.priam and priam 's children will be glad , the hearts of other trojans swell with joy , should they find out about such quarreling , a fight between you two , among danaansthe very best for counsel or combat.but listen .
you are both younger men than i. and i 've been colleague of better men than you , men who never showed me any disrespect , men whose like i have not seen again , and never will—like peirithous , dryas ,
a shepherd to his people , caeneus , exadios , god-like polyphemus , theseus , son of aegeus , all god-like men—the mightiest earthborn men , the strongest.and the enemies they fought against were strong , the most powerful of mountain centaurs .
but they destroyed those creatures totally .
i fought on my own behalf , by myself.no man alive on earth could now fight them .
yet they heard me and followed my advice.so listen , both of you .
that 's what 's best now.agamemnon , you 're an excellent man , but do not take briseis from achilles.let that pass .
achaea 's sons gave her to him first .
and you , peleus ' son , do n't seek to fight the king , not as your enemy .
the sceptre-bearing king , whose powerful authority comes from zeus , never shares honours equally .
achilles , you may be stronger , since your mother was divine , but he 's more powerful , for he rules more men.but you , son of atreus , check your anger .
set aside , i urge you , your rage against achilles , who provides , in the middle of war 's evils , a powerful defence for all achaeans .
old man , everything you say is true enough.but this man wants to put the rest to shame , rule all of us , lord it over everyone .
but some , i think , will not obey him .
so what if the gods , who live forever , made him a spearman ?
is that some reason we should let him say such shameful things ?
i 'd be called a coward , a nobody , if i held back from any actionbecause of something you might say .
do n't tell mewhat i should do .
i 'll not obey you any more.but i will tell you this—remember it well— i 'll not raise my hand to fight about that girl , no , not against you or any other man . you achaeans gave her to me , and now , you seize her back again .
but you 'll not takeanother thing from my swift black ship—you 'll get nothing else with my consent.if you 'd like to see what happens , just try .
then they stood up , dissolving the assembly by the ships.peleus 's son went back to his well-balanced ships and huts , along with patroclus , menoetius ' son , and friends .
agamemnon dragged a swift ship down the shore , chose twenty sailors , loaded on the oxen , offerings for the god , and led on fair-cheeked chryseis.shrewd odysseus shipped on as leader .
they then made sacrificial offerings to apollo— hundreds of perfect bulls and goats—beside the restless sea.savory smells curled up amid the smoke high into heaven .
the men thus occupied , agamemnon did not forget the challenge he 'd made earlier to achilles . he called his heralds , talthybius and eurybates : go to achilles ' tent , peleus 's son , take fair-complexioned briseis by the hand .
bring her to me .
if he wo n't surrender her ,
i 'll come myself in force and take her.for him that will be a worse disaster . with these firm orders , he dismissed the men , who moved off , heavy hearted , along the shore of the restless sea.they reached the huts and ships of the myrmidons.there they found achilles seated by his hut and his black ship . as he saw them approach , achilles felt no joy .
the two heralds , afraid , just stood in silence , out of deference to the king.in his heart achilles sensed their purpose .
he called them .
cheer up , heralds , messengers for gods and men .
i do n't blame you , but agamemnon .
he sends you both here for the girl briseis.come , patroclus , born from zeus , fetch the girl .
give her to these two to take away.let them both witness , before blessed gods , mortal men , and that unfeeling king , if ever there 's a need for me again to defend others from a shameful death.that man 's wits are foolish , disastrously so—he 's not thinking about past or future , how achaeans may fight safely by their ships .
he led out fair-cheeked briseis from the hutand gave her up to be led off . the heralds went back , returning to achaean ships , briseis with them , but against her will . achilles then , in tears , withdrew from his companions , sat by the shore , staring at the wide gray seas .
stretching out his hands , he cried aloud , praying repeatedly to thetis , his beloved mother .
mother , since you gave me life—if only for a while—olympian zeus ,
but he does n't grant me even slight respect .
for wide-ruling agamemnon , atreus ' son , has shamed me , has taken away my prize , appropriated it for his own use .
as he said this , he wept .
his noble mother heard him from deep within the sea , where she sat by her old father . quickly she rose up , moving above gray waters , like an ocean mist , and settled down before him , as he wept.she stroked him , then said : my child , why these tears ?
what sorrows weigh down your heart ?
tell me , so we 'll both know.do n't hide from me what 's on your mind .
with a deep groan , swift-footed achilles then replied .
why should i tell you what you know ?
we came to thebe , eëtion 's sacred city , sacked it , taking everything the city had.achaea 's sons apportioned it all fairlyamongst themselves .
then chryses arrivedat the swift ships of bronze-armed achaeans.archer god apollo 's priest sought out his daughter . he brought with him an enormous ransom , carried in his hands the sacred golden staffwith the shawl of archer god apollo.he begged achaeans , above all atreus ' two sons , the people 's leaders . all achaeans called on themto respect the priest , accept the splendid ransom .
but that did n't please agamemnon in his heart .
he sent him roughly off with harsh abusive ordersthe old man went away again , enraged .
one by one , as the god rained arrows downthroughout the wide achaean army.the prophet calchas , understanding all , told us apollo 's will .
at once i was the firstto recommend we all appease the god.but anger got control of agamemnon.he stood up on the spot and made that threat which he 's just carried out.so quick-eyed achaeans are sending chryseis in fast ships back to chryse , transporting gifts for lord apollo , and heralds cameto take away briseis from my huts , the girl who is my gift from achaea 's sons.so now , if you can , protect your son.go to mount olympus , implore zeus , if ever you in word or deed have pleased him.for often i have heard you boast in father 's housethat you alone of all the deathless gods saved zeus of the dark clouds from disgraceful ruin , when other olympians came to tie him up , hera , pallas athena , and poseidon .
but you , goddess , came and set him free , by quickly calling up to high olympus that hundred-handed monster gods call briareos , and men all name aigaion , a creaturewhose strength was greater than his father's.he sat down beside the son of cronos , exulting in his glory.the sacred gods , afraid , stopped tying up zeus.so sit down right by zeus , clasp his knee , remind him of all that , so he 'll want to help the trojans somehow , corner achaeans by the sea , by their ships ' prows , have them destroyed , so they all enjoy their king , so the son of atreus , wide-ruling agamemnon , himself may see his foolishness , dishonouringachilles , the best of the achaeans .
thetis , shedding tears , answered her son , achilles :
since i brought you up to so much pain ?
would you were safely by your ships dry-eyed.your life is fated to be short—you 'll not live long.now , faced with a quick doom , you 're in distress , more so than any other man .
but i 'll tell these things to thunder-loving zeus .
i 'll go myself to snow-topped mount olympus , to see if he will undertake all this.meanwhile , you should sit by your swift ships , angry at achaeans .
take no part in war .
for yesterday zeus went to oceanus , to banquet with the worthy ethiopians .
in twelve days , when he returns and comes home to olympus , i 'll go to zeus ' bronze-floored house , clasp his knee.i think i 'll get him to consent .
thetis spoke.then she went away , leaving achilles there , angry at heart for lovely girdled briseis , taken from him by force against his will .
odysseus sailed to chryse , bringing with him the sacrificial animals as sacred offerings .
when they had sailed into deep anchorage , they took in the sails and stowed them in the ship .
they threw out anchor stones , lashed stern cables , and clambered out into the ocean surf.they brought off the offerings to archer god apollo .
then chryseis disembarked from the ocean ship.resourceful odysseus led her to the altar , placed her in her beloved father 's hands , then said :
chryses , i have been sent by agamemnon , ruler of men , to bring your daughter to you , and then , on behalf of the danaans ,
to make an offering to lord apollo—all these sacrificial beasts—to placate the god , who now inflicts such dismal evil on us .
chryses gave his daughter a joyful welcome back.and then around the well-built altar , they arrangedthe splendid sacrifice . they washed their hands , and picked up the barley grain for sprinkling .
hear me , god of the silver bow , protectorof chryse , mighty lord of holy cilla , sacred tenedos .
you heard me earlier , when i prayed to you .
just as you honoured me , striking hard against achaeans then , so now , grant me what i pray for—remove disaster , this wretched evil , from the danaans .
so chryses spoke . phoebus apollo heard him .
once they had prayed and scattered barley grain , they pulled back the heads of sacrificial beasts , slit their throats , flayed them , sliced the thigh bones out , and hid them in twin layers of fat , with raw meat on top .
old chryses burned them on split wood , poured wine on them.young men beside him held out five-pronged forks.once the thighs were well burned , they sampled entrails , then sliced up all the rest , skewered the meat on spits , roasted it carefully , and drew off every piece.that work complete , they then prepared a meal and ate.no heart was left unsatisfied .
all feasted equally.and when the men had had their fill of food and drink , young boys filled the mixing bowl with wine up to the brim , and served it , pouring libations into every cup.then all day long young achaean lads played music , singing to the god a lovely hymn of praise , honouring in dance and song the god who shoots from far . hearing them , apollo felt joy fill his heart .
at sunset , as dusk came on , by the ship 's stern they went to sleep .
but when early born , rose-fingered dawn appeared , they set off , once more back to the wide achaean camp.far-shooting apollo sent them favourable winds .
they raised the mast and then the sails . the wind blew , filling out the body of the sail—on both sides of the prow the purple waves hissed loudly as the ship sped on its way , its motion carving a path through the ocean swell.when they reached the broad achaean army , they hauled the black ship high up on the sand , pushed long props tight beneath it , then dispersed , each man returning to his own huts and ships . meanwhile , achilles , divinely born son of peleus , sat down in anger alongside his swift ships .
not once did he attend assembly where men win glory or go out to fight . but he pined away at heart , remaining idle by his ships , yearning for the hue and cry and clash of battle .
twelve days later , the company of gods came back together to olympus , with zeus in the lead.thetis did not forget the promise to her son.she rose up through the ocean waves at daybreak , then moved high up to great olympus . she found zeus , wide-seeing son of cronos , some distance from the rest , seated on the highest peak of many-ridged olympus .
she sat down right in front of him .
with her left hand , she clutched his knees , with her right she cupped his chin , in supplication to lord zeus , son of cronos : father zeus , if , among the deathless gods , i 've ever served you well in word or deed , then grant my prayer will be fulfilled.bring honour to my son , who , of all men will be fate 's quickest victim .
for just now , agamemnon , king of men , has shamed him.he seized his prize , robbing him in person , and kept it for himself .
but honour him , zeus , all-wise olympian .
give the trojans
the upper hand , until achaeans respect my son , until they multiply his honours .
cloud gatherer zeus did not respond.he sat a long time silent .
thetis held his knees , clinging close , repeating her request once more :
promise me truly , nod your head , or deny me—since there 's nothing here for you to fear—so i 'll clearly see how among all godsi enjoy the least respect .
she provokes me so with her abuse . even now , in the assembly of immortal gods , she 's always insulting me , accusing me of favouring the trojans in the war . but go away for now , in case hera catches on .
i 'll take care of this , make sure it comes to pass .
come , to convince you , i 'll nod my head .
among gods that 's the strongest pledge i make .
once i nod my assent , nothing i saycan be revoked , denied , or unfulfilled .
the divine hair on the king of gods fell forward , down over his immortal head , shaking olympus to its very base .
the conference over , the two parted.thetis plunged from bright olympus back into the sea . zeus went inside his house . their father present , all the gods at once stood up from their seats.no one dared stay put as he came in—all rose together.zeus seated himself upon his throne .
looking at him , hera sensed he 'd made some deal with thetis , silver-footed daughter of the old man of the sea . at once she spoke up accusingly :
you always love to work on things in secret , without involving me .
you never want to tell me openly what you intend .
the father of gods and men replied : hera , do n't hope to understand my every plan .
even for my own wife that 's dangerous.what 's appropriate for you to hear about , no one , god or man , will know before you.but when i wish to hide my thoughts from gods , do n't you go digging after them , or pestering me for every detail .
most dread son of cronos , what are you saying ? i have not been overzealous before now , in questioning you or seeking answers .
surely you 're quite at liberty to plananything you wish .
but now , in my mind , i 've got this dreadful fear that thetis , silver-footed daughter of the old man of the sea , has won you over , for this morning early , she sat down beside you , held your knees .
i think you surely nodded your agreement to honour achilles , killing many soldiers , slaughtering them by the achaean ships .
but you ca n't do anything about it , except push yourself still further from my heart , making matters so much worse for you . if things are as they are , then that 's the way i want them .
so sit down quietly.do as i say .
if not , then all the godshere on olympus wo n't be any help , when i reach out to set my hands on you , for they 're invincible .
ox-eyed queen hera sat down , in fear , silently suppressing what her heart desired .
in zeus ' home the olympian gods began to quarrel.then that famous artisan , hephaestus , concernedabout his mother , white-armed hera , spoke to them :
a troublesome matter this will prove—unendurable—if you two start fightingover mortal men like this , inciting gods to quarrel.if we start bickering , we ca n't enjoy the meal , our excellent banquet .
so i 'm urging mother , though she 's more than willing , to humour zeus , our dear father , so he wo n't get angry once again , disturb the feast for us .
for if zeus , the olympian lord of lightning , was of a mind to hurl us from our seats , his strength 's too great.but if you talk to him with soothing words , at once olympian zeus will treat us well .
hephaestus spoke , then stood up , passed a double gobletacross to his dear mother , saying :
stay calm , mother , even though you are upset .
if not , then , as beloved as you are , i may see you beaten up before my eyes , with me incapable of helping out , though the sight would make me most unhappy .
it 's hard to take a stand opposing zeus .
once , when i was eager to assist you , zeus seized me by the feet and threw me out , down from heaven 's heights .
the entire day
as he spoke , the white-armed goddess hera smiled .
he poured the drink , going from right to left , for all the other gods , drawing off sweet nectar from the mixing bowl.then their laughter broke out irrepressibly , as the sacred gods saw hephaestus bustling around , concerned about the feast . all that day they dined , until sunset .
no one 's heart went unsatisfied.all feasted equally .
when the sun 's bright light had set , the gods all went to their own homes . hephaestus , the famous lame god , with his resourceful skill , had made each god a place to live .
olympian zeus , god of lightning , went home to his own bed , where he usually reclined whenever sweet sleepcame over him . he went inside and lay down there , with hera of the golden throne stretched out beside him . gods and warriors slept through the entire night .
but sweet sleep did not visit zeus , tossing and turning over in his mind some way to honour achilles , by slaughtering many soldiers by the achaean ships.in zeus ' heart the best idea seemed to beto send out a wicked dream to agamemnon.calling the dream , zeus said these winged words to him :
evil dream , fly quickly to achaea 's men , by their swift ships .
bid him quickly arm long-haired achaean troops , for now they 'll capture troy , city of wide streets .
immortal gods who dwell on mount olympus no longer disagree about all this . hera 's entreaties have persuaded them . trojans can expect more sorrows , more disasters .
with these instructions , dream set off , quickly reaching achaea 's fast ships and atreus 's son .
he found agamemnon resting in his hut , wrapped up in the sweet divinity of sleep .
dream stood above his head , looking just like nestor , son of neleus , of all the more senior men the one agamemnon held in special honour.in that shape , divine dream spoke to agamemnon :
you are sleeping , son of fiery atreus , tamer of horses . but a prudent man , one to whom people have given their trust , who has so many things to think about , should n't sleep all night . so pay attention .
hear what i have to say . i come to you as zeus ' messenger , with his orders.he 's far off , but pities and cares for you.he bids you quickly arm long-haired achaeans , for now you can take troy , city of wide streets . the immortal gods who dwell on mount olympusno longer disagree about all this .
hera 's entreaties have persuaded them .
trojans can expect from zeus more sorrows , more disasters .
remember what i 've said .
do n't let forgetfulness seize your mind , when honey sleep has loosed his sweet grip on you .
this said , dream went off , leaving the king imagining things which would not come to pass .
he thought he 'd take troy , priam 's city , that very day .
he had no clue of what zeus really meant , his plan to load on them , trojans and danaans both , still more suffering , more cries of sorrow , through war 's brutality .
agamemnon roused himself from sleep , the divine voiceall round him still .
he laced up lovely sandals over his sleek feet and slung a silver-studded sword around both shoulders.he took with him the royal staff of his ancestors , eternal and imperishable .
when goddess dawn rose high up on olympus , bringing light to zeus and the immortals , agamemnon bid the loud-voiced heralds summonall the long-haired achaeans to assembly.such a call went out .
of all his great-hearted senior counselors.they met by nestor 's ships , king born on pylos .
to the assembled group agamemnon then sketched out a plan he had conceived—a devious one .
my friends , listen .
a divine dream has just come to me , through the sacred night , as i lay asleep , in form , size , and voice just like worthy nestor .
he stood above my head and spoke these words : 'you are sleeping , son of fiery atreus , tamer of horses .
but a prudent man , one to whom people have given their trust , who has so many things to think about , should n't sleep all night .
so pay attention.hear what i have to say .
i come to youas zeus ' messenger , with his orders.he 's far off , but pities and cares for you.he bids you quickly arm long-haired achaeans , for now you can take troy , city of wide streets .
immortal gods who dwell on mount olympus no longer disagree about all this .
remember what i 've said .
with that , dream flew off , sweet sleep released me .
come , then , let 's get long-haired achaeans somehow armed for battle .
but first , it 's only right i test the men , ordering them to go home in their ships with many oars .
you hold them back with your commands , each one working from his own position .
nestor stood up before them , king of sandy pylos.with a wise sense of their common cause , he addressed them :
my friends , chiefs and leaders of the argives , if any other achaean had told us such a dream ,
we would declare it quite false , dismiss it .
but now the man who has a claim to be the greatest of achaeans has witnessed it .
so nestor spoke .
then he began to make his way back , leaving the council meeting .
troops came streaming out to them.just as dense clouds of bees pour out in endless swarmsfrom hollow rocks , in clusters flying to spring flowers , charging off in all directions , so from ships and huts the many clans rushed out to meet , group after group.among the troops rumour blazed , zeus ' messenger , igniting them .
nine heralds shouted out instructions , attempting to control the noise , so men could hear their leaders , god 's chosen ones .
the noise subsided.king agamemnon stood up , hands gripping his staff , one fashioned by hephaestus ' careful craftsmanship .
that god had given it to lord zeus , son of cronos .
later zeus had presented it to hermes , the guide , killer of argus.hermes , in his turn , gave it to king pelops , the chariot racer , who passed the staff to atreus , the people 's leader .
thyestes , in his turn , passed it onto agamemnon , who held itas ruler of all argos and many islands.with this staff as his support , agamemnon spoke :
you danaan warriors , comrades , companions of ares , god of war , zeus , son of cronos , has entangled mein some really serious foolishness .
he promised me , he agreed—i 'd have devastated well-built troybefore going home .
now he plans a cruel trick , tells me to return to argos dishonoured , after i 've lost so many warriors .
this is apparently what high zeus desires , he who has smashed so many city heights , and will destroy still more , such is his power , the greatest power of all .
this is a great disgrace , which people will learn about in years to come—how an achaean force of such quality and size vainly sailed off to fight a lesser force , and failed to get what they set out to take.for if we achaeans and the trojans wished , in good faith , to draw up a treaty , to tally up the numbers on both sides , with trojans counting each inhabitant of troy , and if we achaeans set ourselves in groups of ten , then chose , for every group , a trojan manto pour our wine , then of our groups of tenmany would lack a man to act as steward.that , i tell you , indicates just how muchachaea ’ s sons outnumber trojans , those who live in troy .
but all their allies , warrior spearmen from many cities , are a huge problem for me .
they thwart my wishto smash down those sturdy walls of troy.nine of great zeus ' years have rolled on past .
back home our wives and children wait for us .
so come , let 's all agree to what i say .
let 's go back to our own dear country in our ships .
for we 'll not capture troy with its broad streets .
so agamemnon spoke .
among the soldiers , all those with no idea of what he 'd planned , men 's feelings quickened .
when east wind and south wind rush down together from father zeus ' clouds to whip up the sea , the whole assembly rippled , like a large grain field , undulating under the fury of the storm , as west wind roars in with force , all ears of corn ducking down under the power of the gusts— that ’ s how the shouting men stampeded to their ships.from underneath their feet a dust cloud rose .
they yelled orders to each other to grab the ships , drag them to the sacred sea , clear out channels for launching boats , knock out props from underneath , frantic to get home .
at that point , the argives might well have gone back— contravening what fate had proposed for them—if hera had not spoken to athena :
alas , unconquerable child of zeus , who bears the aegis , the argives will flee , go back home to their dear native land , cross the wide sea , abandoning helen , an argive woman , leaving in triumphpriam and his trojans .
so now , come on , go down to the bronze-clad achaean troops , use your persuasive power to stop the menhauling their curved ships down into the sea .
so hera spoke .
bright-eyed goddess athena obeyed.she sped off , raced down from mount olympus ' crest , quickly reached achaea 's swift ships , rushing to the spotodysseus , a man as wise as zeus , was standing .
he 'd laid no hand on his fast , black , well-decked ship .
odysseus , divinely bred , laertes ’ resourceful son , so you are going to fly back home ,
sail off to your own dear country.you 'll leap into your ships with many oars , and leave in triumph priam and the trojans , abandoning argive helen , for whose sakeso many achaeans have died here in troy , far from the homes they love .
do n't hesitate .
persuade each man to stop dragging the curved ships down into the sea .
then he ran , shrugging off his cloak— eurybates , the herald , later picked it up , a man from ithaca , aide to odysseus .
odysseus went straight to agamemnon , atreus ' son , took from him his imperishable ancestral staff .
when he came across some king or prominent leader , he 'd confront him , telling him to hold his ground :
friend , it 's not suitable for you to panic , as if you 're worthless .
take your seat instead.get other soldiers to remain in place.you 've no clear sense of agamemnon 's plan.right now he 's testing all the army.soon enough he 'll punish achaea 's sons .
did n't we all hear what he said in council ? in his rage he may harm achaean troops—passions run high in kings whom zeus supports.their honour comes from zeus the counselor , who loves them .
by contrast , when odysseus came across some common soldier yelling out , he 'd beat him with the staff , admonishing him :
listen to what others say , your betters , you puny coward , useless in war or council .
achaeans ca n't all rule here as kings .
no good comes from having many leaders.let there be one in charge , one ruler , who receives from crooked-minded cronossceptre and laws , so he may rule his people .
odysseus moved throughout the army , calming things .
from ships and huts , soldiers rushed to reassemble , echoing like waves of the roaring sea crashing on shore , as ocean thunders on .
men sat calmly in their places.but a single man kept on yelling out abuse— scurrilous thersites , expert in various insults , vulgar terms for inappropriate attacks on kings , whatever he thought would make the argives laugh .
of all the men who came to troy , he was the ugliest— bow legged , one crippled foot , rounded shoulderscurving in toward his chest .
achilles hated him , as did odysseus , too , both subject to his taunts .
the achaeans , despising thersites in their hearts , were furious at him .
but he kept shouting out , aiming noisy insults right at agamemnon :
son of atreus , what 's your problem now ? what do you lack ?
your huts are stuffed with bronze , plenty of choice women , too—all presentswe achaeans give you as our leader , whenever we ransack some city.or are you in need of still more gold , a ransom fetched by some horse-taming trojan for his son tied up and delivered hereby me or by some other achaean ? or do you want a young girl to stash away , so you ’ re the only one who gets to screw her ?
it 's just not fair that you , our leader , have botched things up so badly for us , achaea 's sons .
let 's sail home in our ships , leave this man , our king , in troy here to enjoy his loot.that way he might come to recognizewhether or not we 're of some use to him .
now agamemnon has even shamed achilles , a much finer warrior than himself , stealing a prize , keeping it for his own use .
then there 's achilles , no heart 's anger there , who lets it all just happen .
if he did n't , this bullying of yours , son of atreus , would be your last .
thersites yelled out these insults right at agamemnon , the people 's shepherd , abusing him .
you 're a champion talker.but do n't try to have it out with kings , all by yourself .
let me tell you something—of all those who came to troy with atreus ' sons , you 're the most disgraceful .
no more words from you abusing our kings , seeking to sneak back home .
how this war will end , we 've no idea—whether achaea 's sonswill go back home successful or will fail.you sit here , railing at agamemnon , atreus ' son , leader of his people , because danaan heroes have given himso many gifts—but that 's a cheap insult.so i 'll tell you how things are going to be.if i find you being so foolish any more , then let odysseus ' head no longer stayupon his shoulders , let him no longerbe called the father of telemachus , if i do n't grab you , rip off all your clothes , cloak and tunic , down to your cock and balls , and beat you back to the fast ships in tears ,
saying this , odysseus lashed out with the sceptre , hitting thersites hard across his back and shoulders .
he doubled up in pain , shedding many tears .
in the middle of thersites ' back sprang up bloody welts beneath the golden sceptre .
he sat down , afraid and hurt , peering around , like an idiot , and rubbing away his tears .
comrades , before now odysseus has done good things , thinking up fine plans and leading us in war .
but that 's the best thing he 's done by farto help the argives , shutting up that rabble-rouser.thersites ' bold spirit wo n't urge him onto trash our kings again with his abuse .
then odysseus , destroyer of cities , rose up , grasping the sceptre.at his side , bright-eyed athena , looking like a herald , silenced troops , so achaeans close by and far awaycould hear him and follow his advice .
odysseus , bearing in mind their common good , spoke out :
son of atreus , now the achaeans wish to disgrace you , their king , shame you before all mortal men .
they 're refusing now to keep their promise , the one they all swore to while sailing here , still on their way from horse-breeding argos , that oath that they 'd return after we 'd destroyedtroy 's strong walls .
like widows or small children , they ’ re whining to each other to go home .
but going back demoralized is bad.a man who spends one month aboard his ship , away from his wife , becomes downhearted
this is now the ninth revolving year we 've been waiting here , on this very spot .
so i do n't think that badly of achaeansin their frustration here by their curved ships.still , it 's shameful to go home with nothing .
my friends , be patient , give us all more time , until calchas ' prophecy comes true or not.we all have kept in mind what he foretold.you all are witnesses , the ones whom fate has not yet visited to carry off in death.not long ago , when our achaean shipsgathered at aulis , bringing disasterfor priam and his trojans , we sacrificed on holy altars placed around a spring hundreds of perfect creatures to the gods , the immortals—underneath that tree , a lovely plane tree , where bright water flowed .
and then a great omen appeared , a snake , blood-red along its back , a dreadful sight , a thing sent out by zeus into the daylight.out from under the altar that snake slithered , darting for the plane tree , where there laytiny , new-born sparrows , eight fledglings , huddled under foliage at the very top .
the serpent ate the infants , who screamed with fear.the mother fluttered around here and there , lamenting her dear chicks .
once the beast had gobbled up the sparrow and her chicks , the god who 'd made the snake appeardid something to it there for all to see.crooked cronos ' son changed that snake to stone ! we stood there astounded at what we 'd seen— a horror desecrating the gods ' sacrifice .
calchas at once spoke out in prophecy : 'long-haired achaeans , why stand there so mute ? counselor zeus has made manifest to us
the ships on all sides resounded ominously , as achaeans roared out their endorsement of his words .
then nestor , the geranian horseman , cried out :
in our assembly you 're all infants , silly children , with no sense of war 's events.what will happen to our agreements , the oaths we made ?
let fire consumeour strategies , men 's plans , our treaties , ratified with wine and handshakes , those things we used to trust .
for now we fight ourselves , arguing like this .
we ca n't find any remedy , though we 've been sitting here for years.son of atreus , you must maintain with forceyour previous plan to lead the argive troops directly to the harsh demands of war.and let those one or two be damned , the men who do n't think like achaeans , the few of them who yearn to go back home—something they 'll find impossible to do—before we learn the truth or falsehoodof what was promised by aegis-bearing zeus .
for i assure you mighty zeus nodded assent on that very day the argives put to sea , bearing troy 's destructive fate in their swift ships .
on our right hand , zeus hurled down lightning bolts , signs manifesting his good will to us . so let no man run off to get back home—not before he 's had sex with some trojan 's wife , payment for helen 's miseries , her cries of pain . if any man is really keen to get back home , let him just set hand to his well-benched ship , he 'll come face to face , in plain view of all , with death , his fate .
you , my lord , think carefully— think about what someone else suggests .
do n't simply throw out what i say to you .
agamemnon , set men in groups by tribes and clans , so clans encourage clans , tribes bolster tribes .
if you do that , if achaeans all obey , you 'll then recognize who 's good and badamong your leaders and your men .
ranged like that , the two groups will stand against each other.you 'll then know whether failure to take troy stems from divine will or craven soldiersor ineptitude in managing the war .
old man , in our assembly once againyou win out over all achaea 's sons .
o father zeus , athena , and apollo— if i only had ten such counselorsamong achaeans , king priam 's citywould soon fall , be taken , sacked at our hands .
but aegis-bearing zeus , son of cronos , keeps showering me with grievous troubles.he throws me into pointless bitter fights.so achilles and i fought for that girl , yelling at each other .
but if we two agreed , were of one mind , then troy 's fate would be sealed without delay , without a moment 's pause .
but let 's go off to eat , so we can resume the fight .
so we can stand all day and battle ares , hateful god of war .
we 'll get no respite , not even for a moment , except at dusk , when nightfall separates the frenzied soldiers.chest straps on our protective body shieldswill be soaked through with sweat .
horses , too , will sweat , under the strain of hauling polished chariots .
but if i see a man coming out to fightreluctantly , hanging back by our curved ships , he 'll not escape being food for dogs and birds .
argives answered agamemnon with a mighty roar , like waves by a steep cliff crashing on the rock face , lashed by south wind 's blasts , always foaming on the rock , whipped on by every wind gusting here and there .
the men leapt up , moved off , scattering to ships , set fires by their huts , and each man ate his dinner .
every man then sacrificed to the immortal gods , praying to escape death and war 's killing zone.agamemnon , king of men , sacrificed an ox , a fat one , five years old , to zeus , exalted son of cronos.he summoned the best senior men of all achaeans— first , nestor and idomeneus , then both ajaxes , then diomedes , tydeus ' son .
warrior menelaus arrived without a summons , knowing in his heart all agamemnon 's worries .
most powerful zeus , exalted lord of thunder clouds , zeus , who dwells in heaven , grant my prayer—may the sun not go down , nor darkness come , before i have cast down priam 's palace , covered it with dust , destroyed its doorsin all-consuming fire , and with my bronze swordsliced to shreds the tunic on hector 's chest.may many of his comrades lie beside him ,
so he prayed .
but cronos ' son did not grant his wish .
once the men had prayed , scattering barley grain , they pulled back the beast 's head , slit its throat , flayed it , sliced thigh bones out and hid them in twin layers of fat , with raw meat on top .
they cooked these on split wood , then placed the innards on spits in hephaestus ' fire .
when the wrapped-up thigh bones were completely cooked , and they 'd tasted samples of the inner organs , they chopped up the rest , arranged the meat on spits , cooked it carefully , then drew it from the fire .
when every man had eatenas much food and drink as anyone could wish , geranian horseman nestor was the first to speak .
lord agamemnon , son of atreus , king of men , let 's end our discussions nowand not postpone work given by the gods .
come , let heralds of bronze-clad achaeanssummon all the soldiers to assembly.let 's move together across the wide front , rouse achaea 's men with blood-lust for war .
he ordered clear-voiced heralds immediately to sound the battle call to long-haired achaeans .
the call went out .
troops assembled on the run .
with them strode athena , her eyes glittering , holding up the aegis— her priceless , ageless , eternal aegis , its hundred golden tassels quivering , each finely woven , valued at a hundred oxen .
as she passed , she roused in men that hot desire to fight , to kill .
at once she made each man feel war far sweeter than returning home , finer than sailing in the hollow ships back to his dear native land .
just as an all-consuming fire burns through huge forests on a mountain top , and men far off can see its light , so , as soldiers marched out , their glittering bronze blazed through the sky to heaven , an amazing sight .
as many birds in flight—geese , cranes , and long-necked swans—in an asian meadow by the flowing river caystrios , fly here and there , proud of their strong wings , and call , as they settle , the meadow resounding with the noise , so the many groups of soldiers moved out then from ships and huts onto scamander 's plain.under men 's and horses ' feet the earth rang ominously .
then they stood there , in that flowered meadow , by the scamander , an immense array , as numerous as leaves and flowers in springtime.like flies swarming around shepherds ' pens in spring , when pails fill up with milk , so the achaeans , a huge long-haired host , marched out onto that plain against the trojans , eager to destroy them .
just as goatherds sort out with ease the wandering beasts , all mixed up in the pasture , so through all the army , the leaders organized the troops for battle .
among them powerful agamemnon roamed , eyes and head like zeus , who loves the thunder , waist like ares , god of war , chest like poseidon.just as in cattle herds the bull stands out above the rest , by far the most conspicuous amid the cows , so on that day zeus made agamemnon stand pre-eminent among the troops , first of heroes .
now , you muses living on olympus , tell me— for you are goddesses and know everything , while we hear only stories , knowing nothing certain— tell me the leaders of danaans , the rulers .
it would be impossible for me to tell
the story of or name those in the common mass , not even with ten tongues , ten mouths , an untiring voice , a heart of bronze , unless the olympian muses , daughters of aegis-bearing zeus , could sing of the men , all those who came to troy .
but i shall list the leaders , commanders of the ships , and all the ships in full .
peneleus , leitus , and arcesilausled the boeotians , with clonius and prothoenor.their men came from hyria , rocky aulis , schoenus , scolus , mountainous eteonus , thespeia , graia , spacious mycalassus , men holding harma , eilesium , erythrae ; men holding eleon , hyle , peteon , ocalea , the well-built fortress medeon , copae , eutresis , thisbe , city full of doves ; men from coronea , grassy haliartus ; men from plataea , glisas , those who heldfortified lower thebe and sacred onchestus , with poseidon 's splendid grove ; men from arne , land rich in grapes , midea , sacred nisa , and distant anthedon .
fifty ships came with these men , each with one hundred and twenty young boeotians . men from aspledon and minyan orchomenus were led by ascalaphus and ialmenus , ares ' sons .
she , a modest virgin , went upstairs , where the god lay with her in secret.these men brought with them a fleet of thirty ships .
schedius and epistrophus , sons of iphitus , the son of great-hearted naubolus , commanded phoceans—men from cyparissus , rocky pytho , holy crisa , daulis , and panopeus ; men from anemorea and hyampolis ; from around the sacred river cephisus , from lilaea , beside cephissus ' springs .
forty black ships these two leaders brought with them .
the locrians were led by swift ajax , son of oileus , the lesser ajax , not the greater ajax , son of telamon , but a much smaller man.though he was short and wore cloth armour , among all hellenes and achaeans he excelled in fighting with his spear .
locrians came from cynus , opous , calliarus , bessa , scarphe , lovely aegeiae , tarphe , thronion , and from around the river boagrius.ajax brought forty black ships of locrians living across from sacred euboea .
elephenor , offspring of ares , son of chalcodon , great-hearted leader , commanded the abantes , who live to breathe war 's fury , soldiers from euboea , chalcis , eretria , wine-rich histiaea , cerinthus by the sea , men from the steep fortress dium , carystus , and styra .
these swift abantes came with elephenor , their hair grown long behind , warrior spearmen , filled with fierce desire to tear apart their enemies , to pierce armed bodies with their long ash spears.forty black ships came with elephenor .
soldiers came from that well-built fortress athens , land of proud erechtheus , whom athena raised , after he was born out of the harvest land .
to him athenian youth make sacrificial offerings , with bulls and rams as each year comes around.menestheus , son of peteos , led these men .
in tactics no one alive on earth could match himin deploying chariots or shield-bearing men.nestor , from a previous age , was his only rival.menestheus brought with him fifty black ships .
from salamis ajax commanded twelve ships .
warriors from argos , fortified tiryns , hermione , asine , both with deep bays , troezene , eionae , vine-rich epidaurus , achaean youth from aegina , mases— all these were led by mighty fighter diomedes , skilled in war cries , and by sthenelus , dear son of famous capaneus .
there was a third leader , god-like euryalus , mecisteus ' son , son of lord talaus .
these men brought with them eighty black ships .
troops from the strong fortress mycenae , rich corinth , well-built cleonae , orneae , lovely araethyrea , sicyon , whose first king was adrestus , with men from hyperesia , lofty gonoessa , pellene , from aegium , men from coastal regions and wide helice—of these men agamemnon , son of atreus , led one hundred ships.the most troops came with him , the finest men by far.in their midst , agamemnon put on a proud display , dressed in gleaming armour , prominent among all heroes.he was the best of all , because he had most men .
men from lacedaemon , land of ravines , pharis , sparta , messe , where doves congregate , men living in bryseae , beautiful augeiae , amyclae , coastal helos , men from laäs , from around oetylus—all these in sixty ships were led by powerful , warlike menelaus , agamemnon 's brother .
among these warriors , as they armed themselves some distance off , menelaus strode—confident , courageous—rousing his troops for war , his heart passionateto avenge helen 's struggles , her cries of pain .
amphigenea , pteleum , helos , dorium , where the muses met the thracian thamyris , and stopped his singing .
he was coming backfrom oechalia , from the court of eurytus the king.he 'd boasted his singing would surpass the muses , daughters of aegis-bearing zeus , should they compete.in their anger the muses mutilated thamyris , taking away his godlike power of song , and making him forget his skill in playing the lyre.geranian horseman nestor led these menin a flotilla of ninety hollow ships .
men from arcadia , from below steep mount cyllene , near aepytus ' tomb , where men excel in combathand to hand , troops from pheneus , orchomenus , rich in flocks , rhipe , stratie , windy enispe , tegea , lovely mantinea , stymphelus , parrhasia—mighty agapenor led these men , ancaeus ' son , in sixty ships .
agamemnon , king of men , had himself provided well-decked ships for them to sail across the wine-dark ocean , for these men lacked expertise in matters of the sea .
soldiers from bouprasium , fair elis , those partsbounded by hyrmine , coastal myrsinus , the rock of olene , and alesium—these troops had four commanders , each with ten swift ships .
the many epeians on board were commanded by amphimachus , son of cteatus , and thalpius , son of eurytus , descended both from actor .
third leader was diores , son of amarynces.fourth was polyxeinus , son of agasthenes , augeas ' son .
men from doulichium , sacred echinean islands , living across the sea from elis , were commandedby warlike meges , son of phyleus , the horseman , loved of zeus .
phyleus , angry with his father , moved to doulichium .
meges brought with him
forty black ships in his flotilla .
odysseus led onthe cephallenians , soldiers from ithaca , well wooded neritum , crocylea , rugged aegilips , from zacynthus , samos , both those inhabiting the mainlandand those from cities on the facing shore.odysseus , as wise as zeus , led these troops , who came with him in twelve black ships .
thoas , son of andraemon , led the aetolians , men from pleuron , olenus , pylene , coastal chalchis , and rocky calydon.proud king oeneus had no living sons , and he himself was dead , as was fair-haired meleager.thus , thoas ruled alone .
he brought forty black ships .
famous spearman idomeneus led the cretans from cnossus , fortified gortyn , lyctus , miletus , chalky lycastus , phaestus , rhytium , both populous towns , with other warriors from crete 's one hundred cities .
idomeneus , famous for fighting with a spear , led these troops , along with meriones , as skilled at killing menas ares , god of war .
they brought eighty black ships .
tlepolemus , son of hercules , a huge brave man , led nine ships of courageous troops , men from rhodes , split into three divisions—from lindus , ialysus , and chalky cameirus—all led by tlepolemus , famous spearman , born to astyocheiaand mighty hercules , who 'd taken her from ephyra , by the river selleis , after razing many townsfull of vital warriors .
once he 'd grown upin their well-furnished home , tlepolemus killed his father 's uncle , licymnius , a well-loved old man , a great fighter , too .
at once tlepolemus built a fleet , assembled many men , and fled away .
he suffered badly , until he came to rhodes , whose people live in three groups split by tribes.zeus , who governs gods and men , loved them , and so the son of cronos blessed them with great wealth .
nireus brought three well-balanced ships from syme.the son of aglaea and lord charopus , the handsomest of all danaans who sailed to troy , after achilles , who had no equal .
men from nisyrus , crapathus , casus , cos , eurypylus ' city , the calydnian islands had pheidippus and antiphus , sons of lord thessalus , hercules ' son , as leaders .
with them came thirty hollow ships .
all the troops from pelasgian argos , alos , men living in alope , trachis , from phthia , and hellas , where lovely women live , men calledmyrmidons , hellenes , achaeans—these troops achilles led in fifty ships .
but their minds were n't set on the grim clash of war .
they had no one to lead them.godlike achilles , swift of foot , sat by his ships , still angry over fair-complexioned briseis , seized from lyrnessus after heavy fighting.achilles had laid waste lyrnessus and thebe 's walls , overthrown the spearmen mynes and epistrophus , sons of lord euenus , son of king selepius because of her , achilles sat still grieving .
but soon enough he 'd rouse himself again .
troops from phylace , flowering pyrasus , shrine of demeter , iton , where flocks breed , antrum by the sea , and grassy pteleum— brave protesilaus had led these men , while still alive .
in phylace , he left behind a wife to tear her cheeks in grief ,
some dardanian killed him , as he jumped on trojan soil , the first on shore , far ahead of all achaeans .
his soldiers lamented the loss of their chief , but did n't lack a leader .
warlike podarces , son of iphicles , led them— the man owned many flocks and was a young blood brotherto protesilaus .
so these troops had a leader , though they missed the noble one they 'd lost.podarces brought forty black ships along with him .
troops from pherae by lake boebea , from boebeïs , glaphyrae , well-built iolcus—these camein eleven ships , commanded by eumelus , admetus ' well-loved son , born to him by alcestis , loveliest of pelias ' daughters .
troops from methone , thaumacia , meliboea , and rugged olizon , were led by philoctetes , the skilled archer , in seven ships , each with fifty men , expert archers .
but philoctetes stayed behind on lemnos , the sacred island , in horrific pain , abandoned.achaea 's sons had left him there in agony , wounded by a snake bite .
he lay there in torment.but soon the argives by their ships would have reason to remember him .
these soldiers missed their chief , but were now led by medon , oïleus ' bastard son , whom rhene bore to oïleus , destroyer of cities .
men from tricca , rocky ithome , oechalia , city of eurytus , the oechalian , were commanded by two sons of asclepius , skilled healers , podaleirus and machaon .
they brought thirty hollow ships with them.troops from ormenius , from the fount of hyperea , from asterius , from titanus with its white hilltops— these men were commanded by eurypylus , fine son of euaemon , in forty black ships .
men from argissa , gyrtone , orthe , elone , the white city oloösson—these troops were ledby polypoetes , a steadfast soldier , son of perithous , himself son to immortal zeus.that famous lady hippodameia borepolypoetes to perithous on that very day he took revenge out on those hairy monsters , and beat them from mount pelion towards the aithices .
but polypoetes was not the sole commander.with him was leonteus , a warlike man , son of proud-hearted coronus , caeneus ' son.with them they brought forty black ships .
gouneus brought twenty-two ships from cyphus.with him sailed the enienes and peraebians , reliable fighting men from cold dodona , who work by the lovely river titaressus , which empties its beautiful , flowing waters into the peneus .
these do not intermingle with the silver stream of the peneus , but flow along on top of them , like oil.for the titaressus is a branch of the river styx , dread waters by which the most solemn oaths are sealed .
prothous , son of tenthredon , led the magnetes , from the region round peneus and mount pelion , where leaves are always trembling in the wind .
with him swift prothous brought forty black ships .
these men were leaders , rulers of the danaans.muse , tell me this—which of them were the very best of those who came over with the sons of atreus ?
the best horses were those of admetus , son of pheres .
eumelus drove them .
as fast as birds , they matched each other in colour , age , and height along the back.bred by apollo of the silver bow in perea , both mares , they carried terror with them .
of the men , by far the best was ajax , son of telamon ,
but only while achilles did n't join in battle .
for achilles was the better man by far.the horses carrying peleus ' son , man without equal , were much better , too .
but he stayed behind , by his curved seaworthy ships , still enragedat agamemnon , atreus ' son , the people 's shepherd .
his soldiers amused themselves beside the breaking sea by throwing spears and discus or with archery.their horses stood near their chariots , browsing on lotus and parsley from the marsh .
their masters ' chariots , fully covered , remained stationed in the huts .
missing their warlike leader , these troops strolledhere and there throughout the camp and did not fight .
earth groaned under them , just as it doeswhen zeus , who loves thunder , in his anger lashes the land around typhoeus , among the arimi , where people say typhoeus has his lair.that 's how the earth groaned loudly under marching feet .
then wind-swift iris came to troy as messenger from aegis-bearing zeus carrying grim news.trojans had summoned an assembly by priam 's palace gates .
standing by priam , swift-footed iris spoke , sounding like polites , priam 's son.he 'd been stationed as a scout—fully confidentof his skill at running—at old aesyetes ’ tomb , right at the top , waiting for the moment achaeans moved out from their ships .
priam , old man , you always love to talk about irrelevant things , as you did earlier in peacetime .
but now this war continuesrelentlessly .
i 've gone to battle many times.i 've never seen an army like this one , so many men ,
as numerous as leaves or grains of sand , coming across the plain to assault our city.hector , i call on you , on you above all , to followmy instructions—the numerous allies herein priam 's great city all speak different languagesfrom far-scattered regions .
so let each manissue orders to the ones he leads , let him now organize his countrymen , then lead them out to battle .
people call it batieia , but the gods know it as the tomb of agile myrine.here the trojans and their allies marshaled forces .
hector of the flashing helmet , priam 's son , led out the trojans .
with him marched in arms the largest contingent , the finest men by far , eager to get working with their spears .
aeneas , anchises ' worthy son , led the dardanians .
but aeneas was not their sole commander .
with him were antenor 's two sons , archelochus and acamas , extremely skilled in every form of war .
men from zeleia , on mount ida 's lowest slope , wealthy trojans , men who drink dark waters of the river aesepus were led by pandarus , lycaon 's worthy son , whom apollo had taught archery .
soldiers from adresteia , apaesus , pityeia , steep mount tereia were commanded by adrestusand amphius in cloth armour , merops ' sons from percote , who knew more of prophecy than anyone .
they did not obey him .
troops from percote , practius , sestos , abydos , holy arisbe—these troops were led by asius , son of hyrtacus , an important ruler.arius 's huge , tawny horses brought himfrom arisbe , from the river selleïs .
hippothous led tribes of spearmen from pelasgia , fertile larisa , along with pylaeus , offshoots of ares , sons of pelasgian lethus , teutamus 's son .
pyraechmes led archers from paeonia , from far off amydon , by the axius , a broad flowing river , whose moving watersare the loveliest on earth .
pylaemenes , a brave soldier , commanded paphlagoniansfrom enetae , where herds of mules run wild , men from cytorus , from around sesamus , those with fine homes by the stream parthenius , from cromna , aegialus , high erithini .
but ennomus ' great skill in prophecydid not allow him to evade his deadly fate.swift achilles , descendant of aeacus , killed himin the river where he slaughtered other trojans .
mesthles and antiphus commanded the maeonians .
sons of talaemenes , born to gygaea , a water nymph , they led maeoniansfrom around the foot of mount tmolus .
nastes led the carians , men with a strange language , from miletus , phthires , with its wooded mountain , maeander 's waters and high peaks of mount mycale.nastes and amphimachus , noble sons of nomionwere their leaders .
nastes went to war carrying gold , like a girl .
what a fool !
his gold did not spare him a wretched death .
sarpedon and noble glaucus commanded lycians , from distant lycia , by the swirling river xanthus .
once troops had formed in ranks under their own leaders , trojans marched out , clamouring like birds , like cranes screeching overhead , when winter 's harsh storms drive them off , screaming as they move over the flowing ocean , bearing death and destruction to the pygmies , launching their savage attack on them at dawn .
achaeans came on in silence , breathing ferocity , determined to stand by each other in the fight .
just as south wind spreads mist around the mountain peak , something shepherds hate , but thieves prefer to night , for one can see only a stone 's throw up ahead , so , as men marched , dense dust clouds rose from underfoot .
then godlike paris stepped out , as trojan champion , on his shoulders a leopard skin .
brandishing two bronze-tipped spears , he challenged the best men in the whole achaean force to fight— a single combat , to the death .
war-loving menelaus noticed alexander striding there , his troops bunched up in ranks behind him , and he rejoiced , like a famished lion finding a large carcass— antlered stag or wild goat—and devouring it at once , though fierce young hunters and swift dogs attack .
so menelaus was pleased to see paris there , right before his eyes .
menelaus had in mind
at once menelaus jumped from his chariot , down to the ground , his weapons in his fists .
when godlike alexander saw menelaus there , among the fighters at the front , his heart sank .
he moved back into the ranks , among his comrades , avoiding death .
just as a man stumbles on a snake in some mountainous ravine and gives way , jumping back , his limbs trembling , his cheeks pale , so godlike paris , afraid of atreus ' son , slid back into proud trojan ranks .
how i wishyou never had been born or died unmarried .
that 's what i 'd prefer , so much betterthan to live in shame , hated by others.now long-haired achaeans are mocking us , saying we 've put forward as a championone who looks good , but lacks a strong brave mind .
was this what you were like back on that dayyou gathered up your faithful comrades , sailed sea-worthy ships across the ocean , went out among a foreign people , and carried back from that far-off landa lovely woman linked by marriageto warrior spearmen , thus bringing ongreat suffering for your father and your city , all your people—joy to your enemiesand to yourself disgrace ?
and can you nownot face menelaus ?
if so , you 'd learnthe kind of man he is whose wife you took.you 'd get no help then from your lyre , long hair , good looks—aphrodite 's gifts—once face down , lying in the dirt .
trojans must be timid men.if not , for all the evil things you 've doneby now you ’ d wear a garment made of stones .
hector , you 're right in what you say against me.those complaints of yours are not unjustified .
your heart is tireless , like a wood-chopping axewielded by a craftsman cutting timber for a ship.the axe makes his force stronger .
but do n't blame mefor golden aphrodite 's lovely gifts .
men ca n't reject fine presents from the gods , those gifts they personally bestow on us , though no man would take them of his own free will.you want me now to go to battle.get others to sit down—trojans and achaeans.put me and war-loving menelausin their midst to fight it out for helen , all her property .
the one who triumphs , comes off victorious , the better man , let him take all the goods and lead her home , as his wife .
let others swear a solemn oath , as friends , either to live on in fertile troyor to return to horse-breeding argos , land of the lovely women of achaea .
he went to the middle ground , between the armies , halted trojan troops , grasping the centre of his spear shaft .
but long-haired achaeans kept on shooting , attempting to hit hector with rocks and arrows.then agamemnon , king of men , roared out at them :
argives , achaean lads , stop hurling things.hector of the flashing helmet wants to talk to us .
once agamemnon spoke , the men stopped fighting , quickly falling silent .
you trojans , you well-armed achaeans , listen now to what paris has to say , the man whose actions brought about our fight.he bids the other trojans , all achaeans ,
he and war-loving menelaus here will fight it out alone between the armiesfor helen and for all her property.whichever one comes out victorious , the stronger man , let him seize all the goods , and take the woman as his wife back home.let others swear a solemn oath as friends .
listen now to me .
so now i think argives and trojans should part company , since you have suffered many hardships , thanks to the fight between myself and paris , a fight that he began .
whichever one of us death takes , our fate , let that man perish.you others quickly go your separate ways.so bring two lambs here—white male , black female—for earth and sun .
we 'll bring one more for zeus.lead out great priam to administer the oathin person , for his sons are over-proud , untrustworthy .
no man should transgressby violence oaths sworn in zeus ' name.young men 's minds are fickle .
achaeans and trojans were elated , full of hope that wretched war would end .
they pulled the chariots back into the ranks , climbed out , disarmed , and placed their weapons next to each other on the ground , with little roombetween both groups .
hector sent two heralds to the city , to fetch the lambs with speed and summon priam.agamemnon sent talthybius to the hollow ships , instructing him to bring a sacrificial lamb.talthybius obeyed god-like agamemnon 's orders .
then iris came as messenger to white-armed helen , taking on the image of her sister-in-law , wife of antenor 's son , fine helicaon .
she found helen in her room , weaving a large cloth , a double purple cloak , creating pictures of the many battle scenes between horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans , wars they suffered for her sake at the hands of ares .
come here , dear girl.look at the amazing things going on.horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans , men who earlier were fighting one anotherin wretched war out there on the plain , both keen for war 's destruction , are sitting still.alexander and war-loving menelausare going to fight for you with their long spears.the man who triumphs will call you his dear wife .
with these words the goddess set in helen 's heart sweet longing for her former husband , city , parents.covering herself with a white shawl , she left the house , shedding tears .
she did not go alone , but took with her two attendants , aethrae , daughter of pittheus , and ox-eyed clymene .
oucalegaon and antenor , both prudent men , elder statesmen , sat at the scaean gates , with priam and his entourage—panthous , thymoetes , lampus , clytius , and warlike hicataeon .
old men now , their fighting days were finished , but they all spoke well .
they sat there , on the tower , these trojan elders , like cicadas perched up on a forest branch , chirping soft , delicate sounds .
there 's nothing shameful about the fact that trojans and well-armed achaeans
she 's beautiful.but nonetheless let her go back with the ships.let her not stay here , a blight on us , our children .
so they talked .
come here , dear child .
sit down in front of me , so you can see your first husband , your friends , your relatives .
as far as i 'm concerned , it ’ s not your fault .
for i blame the gods.they drove me to wage this wretched waragainst achaeans .
tell me , who 's that large man , over there , that impressive , strong achaean ?
others may be taller by a head than him , but i 've never seen with my own eyes such a striking man , so noble , so like a king .
my dear father-in-law , whom i respect and honour , how i wish i 'd chosen evil death when i came here with your son , leaving behind my married home , companions , darling child , and friends my age .
but things did n't work that way .
so i weep all the time .
but to answer you , that man is wide-ruling agamemnon , son of atreus , a good king , fine fighter , and once he was my brother-in-law , if that life was ever real .
i 'm such a whore .
son of atreus , blessed by the gods , fortune 's child , divinely favoured , many long-haired achaeansserve under you .
once i went to phrygia , that vine-rich land , where i saw phrygian troopswith all their horses , thousands of them , soldiers of otreus , godlike mygdon ,
camped by the banks of the sangarius river.i was their ally , part of their army , the day the amazons , men 's peers in war , came on against them .
the old man then spied odysseus and asked :
dear child , come tell me who this man is , shorter by a head than agamemnon , son of atreus .
his armour 's stackedthere on the fertile earth , but he strides on , marching through men 's ranks just like a ram moving through large white multitudes of sheep .
that man is laertes ' son , crafty odysseus , raised in rocky ithaca .
at that point , wise antenor said to helen :
lady , what you say is true .
once lord odysseuscame here with war-loving menelaus , as an ambassador in your affairs.i received them both in my residenceand entertained them .
i got to know them—from their appearance and their wise advice .
when they mingled with us trojansin our meeting and menelaus rose , his broad shoulders were higher than the other's.but once they sat , odysseus seemed more regal .
when the time came for them to speak to us , setting out their thoughts quite formally , menelaus spoke with fluency—few words , but very clear—no chatter , no digressions—
although he was the younger of the two.but when wise odysseus got up to speak , he just stood , eyes downcast , staring at the ground.he did n't move the sceptre to and fro , but gripped it tightly , like some ignoramus—a bumpkin or someone idiotic.but when that great voice issued from his chest , with words like winter snowflakes , no man alivecould match odysseus .
we were no longer disconcerted at witnessing his style .
priam , the old man , saw a third figure , ajax , and asked :
who is that other man ? he ’ s over there—that huge , burly achaean—his head and shoulderstower over the achaeans .
that 's massive ajax , achaea 's bulwark.across from him stands idomeneus , surrounded by his cretans , like a god .
often war-loving menelaus welcomed himin our house , whenever he arrived from crete.now i see all the bright-eyed achaeanswhom i know well , whose names i could recite.but i ca n't see two of the men 's leaders , castor , tamer of horses , and pollux , the fine boxer—they are both my brothers , whom my mother bore along with me.either they did not come with the contingentfrom lovely lacedaemon , or they sailed here in their seaworthy ships , but have no wish to join men 's battles , fearing the disgrace , the many slurs , which are justly mine .
but the life-nourishing earth
through troy , heralds brought offerings to seal the binding oaths , two lambs and in a goatskin sack some sparkling wine , fruit of the earth .
idaios , the herald , brought in the gleaming mixing bowl and golden cups.standing close by priam , he encouraged him .
son of laomedon , the leading officers among horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeansare calling you to come down to the plain , to administer their binding promises.paris and war-loving menelausare going to fight it out with their long spearsover the woman .
the man who wins , who comes off the victor , gets the womanand her property .
the others will all swear an oath of friendship , a binding one—we will live in fertile troy , they in argos , where horses breed , and in achaea , land of lovely women .
they obeyed at once.priam climbed in and pulled back on the reins.antenor climbed in the fine chariot beside him .
once they reached the trojans and achaeans , they climbed out of the chariot onto fertile ground , in the space between the trojan and achaean troops .
at once , agamemnon and crafty odysseus stood up to greet them .
noble heralds fetched the offerings , to ratify their solemn oaths pledged to the gods .
they prepared wine in the mixing bowl , then poured water over the kings ' hands .
atreus ' son drew out the daggerwhich always hung beside his sword 's huge scabbard ,
raising his hands , agamemnon then intoned a mighty prayer on their behalf :
father zeus , ruling from mount ida , most glorious , most powerful , and you , too , god of the sun , who sees everything , hears everything , you rivers , earth , you gods below the earth , who punish the dead when men swear false oaths , you gods are witnesses .
if alexander slays menelaus , let him keep helen , all her property.let us return in our sea-worthy ships.but if fair-haired menelaus kills alexander , then let the trojans hand back helen , with all her property , and compensateachaeans with something suitable , which future ages will remember .
if alexander 's killed and priamand priam 's children are unwillingto reimburse me , then i 'll remain here , fight on until i 'm fully satisfied , until i end this war appropriately .
with his bronze dagger , he slit the lambs ' throats , placed them on the ground , gasping in their death throes as their life ebbed out , their spirit sliced away by agamemnon 's knife .
next from the mixing bowl , they drew off wine in cups , poured out libations to the deathless gods .
most powerful , mighty zeus , and you others , you immortal gods , may you make surethe men who first violate these oathswill have their brains spill out onto the ground , just like this wine , they and their children .
but the son of cronos did n't grant their wish .
i have no wish to see with my own eyes my dear son fight war-loving menelaus.zeus and other immortal gods know wellwhich of them is fated to end up dead .
he placed the lambs in his chariot.the god-like man climbed in , held back the reins.antenor climbed in the fine chariot by priam .
then hector , priam 's son , and lord odysseus first measured out the ground , took lots , and shook them up in a bronze helmet , to see who 'd throw his bronze spear first .
father zeus , ruling from mount ida , mighty , all-powerful , of these two men , let the one who brought this war to both sides be killed and then go down to hades ' house.and grant our oath of friendship will hold firm .
hector of the flashing helmet turned his eyes to one side and shook out the lots .
alexander 's token fell out immediately.the troops sat down in their respective places , by their high-stepping horses and their inlaid armour .
paris , husband to helen with the lovely hair , hoisted his fine armour on his shoulders .
then he put around his chest the body armour belonging to his brother lycaon .
it fit him well .
on his shoulder he looped his bronze , silver-studded sword , his huge strong shield .
on his handsome head he put a fine helmet with nodding horse-hair plumes on top , full of menace .
then he picked out a brave spear which fit his grip .
menelaus prepared himself as well.when the two men , standing on each side with their troops , had armed themselves , they strode out to the open space between the trojans and achaeans , staring ferociously .
the two men approached each other over measured ground , brandishing their spears in mutual fury .
alexander was the first to hurl his spear.it struck menelaus ' shield , a perfect circle , but the bronze did not break through , the point deflected by the powerful shield .
lord zeus , grant i may be revenged on this man , who first committed crimes against me , lord alexander .
let him die at my hands , so generations of men yet to comewill dread doing wrong to anyone who welcomes them into his home as friends .
the heavy spear pierced through it , went straight through the fine body armour , through the shirtwhich covered alexander 's naked flesh .
but paris twisted to the side , evading a black fate.pulling out his silver-studded sword , the son of atreus raised it and struck the crest of paris ' helmet.but the sword shattered into three or four pieces , falling from his hand .
the son of atreus , in vexation , looked up into wide heaven , crying out :
father zeus , what god brings us more trouble than you do ?
i thought i was paying alexanderfor his wickedness , but now my swordhas shattered in my fist , while from my handmy spear has flown in vain .
i have n't hit him .
as menelaus said these words , he sprang forward , grabbing the horse hair crest on paris ' helmet , twisting him around .
he began dragging paris off , back in the direction of well-armed achaeans.the fine leather strap stretched round paris ' soft neck , right below his chin , was strangling him to death .
at that point menelaus would 've hauled back paris and won unending fame , if aphrodite , zeus ' daughter , had not had sharp eyes .
her force broke the ox-hide strap , leaving menelaus clutching in his massive hands an empty helmet .
whipping it around , menelaus hurled the helmet in among well-armed achaeans.his loyal companions retrieved it .
he charged back , with his bronze spear , intent on killing alexander .
but aphrodite had snatched paris up—for a godan easy feat—concealed him in a heavy mist , and placed him in his own sweetly scented bedroom .
she found her on the high tower , in a crowd among the trojan women .
she clutched helen by her perfumed dress , twitched it , then addressed her , in the form of an old woman , a wool carder , someone who used to live in lacedaemon , producing fine wool , a woman helen really liked .
he 's in the bedroom , on the carved-out bed , his beauty and his garments glistening.you would n't think he 's just come from some fight.he looks as if he 's going to a dance , or if he 's sitting down right after dancing .
noticing the goddess ' lovely neck , enticing breasts , her glittering eyes , helen was astonished .
goddess , why do you wish to deceive me so ? are you going to take me still further off , to some well-populated city somewherein phrygia or beautiful maeonia , because you 're in love with some mortal manand menelaus has just beaten parisand wants to take me , a despised woman , back home with him ?
is that why you 're here , you and your devious trickery ? why do n't you go with paris by yourself , stop walking around here like a goddess , stop guiding your feet toward olympus , and lead a miserable life with him , caring for him , until he makes you his wife or slave .
i wo n't go to him in there—that would be shameful , serving him in bed .
every trojan woman would revile me afterwards .
besides , my heart is hurt enough already .
divine aphrodite , angry at helen , answered her :
do n't provoke me , you obstinate girl.i might lose my temper , abandon you , and hate you just as much as i have loved you.i could make trojans and danaans hate you , too.then you 'd suffer death in misery .
she covered herself in her soft white linen shawl , went off in silence , unnoticed by all the trojan women .
helen , goddess among women , went to her room upstairs , where laughter-loving goddess aphrodite picked up a chair and carried it for helen .
with eyes averted , she began to criticize her husband :
you 've come back from the fight .
how i wish you 'd died there , killed by that strong warriorwho was my husband once .
you used to boastyou were stronger than warlike menelaus , more strength in your hands , more power in your spear.so go now , challenge war-loving menelausto fight again in single combat .
i 'd suggest you stay away .
do n't fight it outman to man with fair-haired menelaus , without further thought .
you might well die , come to a quick end on his spear .
wife , do n't mock my courage with your insults.yes , menelaus has just defeated me , but with athena 's help .
next time i 'll beat him .
for we have gods on our side , too .
but come , let 's enjoy our love together on the bed.never has desire so filled my mind as now , not even when i first took you awayfrom lovely lacedaemon , sailing off in our sea-worthy ships , or when i lay with you in our lover 's bed on the isle of cranae.that 's how sweet passion has seized hold of me , how much i want you now .
he led the way to bed .
his wife went , too .
atreus ' son paced through the crowd , like a wild beast , searching for some glimpse of godlike alexander.but no trojan nor any of their famous allies
if they 'd seen him , they had no desire to hide him .
for they all hated paris , as they hated gloomy death .
listen to me , trojans , dardanians , allies—victory clearly falls to war-loving menelaus.so give back argive helen and her property , compensate us with a suitable amount , something future ages will all talk about .
the gods all sat assembled in the golden courtyard , with zeus there , too .
they toasted each other in golden cups , as they looked out on troy .
then zeus , son of cronos , wishing to irk hera with a sarcastic speech , addressed them in deviously provoking words :
menelaus has two goddessesassisting him , hera of argos and athena of alalcomene.but they sit far away , looking on , enjoying themselves , while aphrodite , who loves laughter , helps paris all the time , protecting him from death .
now , for instance , she 's just rescued him from certain death.for war-loving menelaus was the victor , no doubt of that .
but why do n't we discusshow this warfare is going to finish up—whether we should re-ignite harsh combat , this horrific strife , or make both sides friends.if this second option pleases all of us , if we find it sweet , then king priam 's cityremains inhabited , and menelaustakes argive helen home with him .
athena and hera sat together muttering , plotting trouble for the trojans .
angry at zeus , her father , athena sat there silently , so enraged she did n't say a word .
but hera , unable to contain her anger , burst out :
how can you wish to undermine my efforts , prevent them from achieving anything ?
what about the sweat which dripped from me , as i worked so hard , wearing my horses out , gathering men to wipe out priam and his children.go ahead then .
but all we other godsdo not approve of what you 're doing .
then cloud-gatherer zeus , irritated , said to her :
dear wife , what sort of crimes have priamor priam 's children committed against you , that you should be so vehemently keento destroy that well-built city ilion ? if you went through its gates or its huge walls , you 'd gorge on priam and his children , other trojans , too , swallow their flesh raw.that 's what you 'd do to slake your anger.do as you wish .
we should n't make this mattersomething you and i later squabble over , a source of major disagreements.but i 'll tell you this—keep it in mind .
whenever i get the urge to wipe outsome city whose inhabitants you love , do n't try to thwart me .
let me have my way .
i 'll give in to you freely , though unwillingly.for of all towns inhabited by earth 's peoples , under the sun , beneath the heavenly stars , sacred ilion , with priam and his people , expert spearmen , stands dearest in my heart .
the three cities i love the best by farare argos , sparta , and mycenae ,
destroy them utterly , if you ever hate them in your heart .
i wo n't deny you or get in your way.if i tried disagreeing with such destruction , my hostile stance would be quite useless .
for you are far more powerful than me.but my own work must not be wasted , worth nothing .
i 'm a god , the same race as you—i 'm crooked-minded cronos ' eldest daughter .
another thing—in addition to my birth—i 'm called your wife , and you rule all immortals .
in this matter , then , let 's both supporteach other 's wishes—you mine , i yours.other gods will follow our example .
instruct athena to go immediatelywhere trojans and achaeans carry ontheir bitter conflict .
there she should tryto get the trojans to break their oaths first , by harming the glorious achaeans .
the father of gods and men agreed .
try to get the trojans to break their oaths first , by injuring the glorious achaeans .
she darted from olympus summit , sped off , like a comet sent by crooked-minded cronos ' son , a beacon for sailors and the wide race of men , showering sparks behind her as she flew .
that 's how pallas athena shot to earth , then dropped right down into the middle of the soldiers .
there 's going to be more war , more wretched combat ,
or else great zeus , who serves up war to men , will make the troops on both sides friends .
athena went down into the trojan crowd , looking like laodocus , antenor 's son , a strong spearman , seeking godlike pandarus .
she met pandarus , lycaon 's powerful son , a fine man , standing there with his sturdy regiment , shield-bearing troops who 'd come from the river aesopus.standing near him , athena spoke .
fiery hearted son of lycaon , why not do as i suggest ?
prepare yourselfto shoot a swift arrow at menelaus.you 'd earn thanks and glory from all trojans , most of all from prince alexander.he 'd be the very first to bring fine gifts , if he could see warlike menelaus , son of atreus , mounted on his bier , his bitter funeral pyre , killed by your arrow .
so come , then , shoot an arrow at him—at splendid menelaus .
promise apollo , illustrious archer born in lycia , you 'll make fine sacrifice , some new-born lambs , once you get back to your city , holy zeleia .
pandarus took up his bow of polished horn , made from a nimble wild goat he himself once shot under the chest , as it leapt down from a rock.he 'd waited in an ambush and hit it in the front.the goat fell down onto the rocks , landing on its back.horns on its head were sixteen palm widths long .
his brave companions held their shields before him , just in case achaea 's warlike sons attacked them , before he could shoot menelaus , atreus ' warrior son .
then , removing the cover from his quiver , pandarus took out an arrow , a fresh-winged courier bearing dark agony .
next he quickly set the keen arrow on the string , swearing an oath to the archer god , lycian-born apollo , that he would make splendid sacrifice , first-born lambs , when he got back to his city , holy zaleia .
gripping the arrow notch , the ox-gut bowstring , he pulled back , drawing the string right to his nipple , iron arrow head against the bow .
once he 'd bentthat great bow into a circle , the bow twanged , the string sang out , the sharp-pointed arrow flew away , eager to bury itself in crowds of men .
but , menelaus , the immortal sacred godsdid not forget you .
athena , zeus ' daughter , goddess of war 's spoils , was first to stand before you , to ward off the piercing arrow—she brushed it from your skin , just as a mother brushes a fly off her child while he lies sweetly sleeping .
athena led the arrow to the spot where the gold buckles on the beltrest on the joint in the double body armour .
the keen arrow dug into the leather strap , passed right through the finely decorated belt , through the richly embossed armour , the body mail , his most powerful guard , worn to protect his flesh , by blocking spears and arrows .
just as when some woman of meonia or caria stains white ivory with purple dye , making a cheek piecefor a horse , and leaves it in her room—an object many riders covet for themselves , a king 's treasure with double value—horse 's ornament and rider 's glory— that 's how , menelaus , your strong thighs , shins and ankles were stained with your own blood below the wound .
when agamemnon saw dark blood flowing from the wound ,
but when he sawbarbs of the arrow head , its binding , still outside , not underneath the skin , his spirits rose , and courageflowed back into his chest .
mighty agamemnon , taking menelaus by the hand , with a bitter groan , spoke to his companions , all grieving with him :
dear brother , that oath i swore to was your death—letting you step forward to fight trojans , as achaea 's champion .
for now the trojanshave shot you , walking roughshod on their oaths , that treaty they swore to in good faith .
but still , the oath , lambs ' blood , unmixed libations , handshakes , things in which we placed our trust—all these will not go in vain .
for if zeus , the olympian , does not fulfill them now , later on he will .
trojans will pay much— with their heads , their wives , their children.i know in my mind and heart that day will comewhen holy troy , priam , and his people , fine spearmen , will be annihilated , when high-ruling zeus , son of cronos , who dwells in the sky , angry at their lies , will shake his dark aegis against them all .
these things will be fulfilled .
but , menelaus , i 'll be in dreadful pain on your account , if you die , if fate now ends your life , if i return to arid argos totally disgraced .
for achaeans immediately will think of home , leaving priam and his trojans here in triumph , abandoning helen , an argive woman.your bones will lie rotting here in trojan soil , recalling the work we failed to finish .
then some arrogant trojan , leaping up onto the tomb of famous menelaus , will shout : 'may agamemnon 's angeralways end like this .
his achaean army he brought here in vain .
back to his native land in empty ships , abandoning courageous menelaus .
that 's what he 'll say .
before that dayi hope the broad earth will lie over me !
then menelaus , to cheer up agamemnon , said :
do n't upset achaeans .
this sharp arrow is not a fatal hit.my gleaming belt protected me on top , as did my body chain mail underneath , forged in bronze .
my dear menelaus , i hope that 's true .
but a healer must inspect your wound , apply his medicine to relieve black pain .
agamemnon ordered talthybius , his godlike herald :
talthybius , as quickly as you can , get machaon here , son of asclepius , healer without equal , to look overwarlike menelaus , son of atreus , shot by someone 's arrow , a skilled archer , trojan or lycian—to his glory and our grief .
he saw him there , standing among the ranks of his strong warriors , shield-bearing men who 'd come with him from tricca , land where horses breed .
son of asclepius , rouse yourself .
shot by someone 's arrow , a skilled archer , trojan or lycian—to his glory and our grief .
they came where wounded fair-haired menelaus lay.around him all the noblest men had gathered in a circle.machaon , godlike man , strode into the middle , drew the arrow from the belt without delay , twisting back the sharp barbs as he pulled the arrow out .
he undid the finely decorated belt and armour , then , under that , the chain mail forged in bronze .
next , he inspected the wound the keen arrow made , sucked out the blood , then skillfully applied his potions , soothing medicines which cheiron gave his father .
while the achaeans were looking after menelaus , lord of the loud war shout , trojan ranks advanced , shields ready , once more armed with all their weapons , fully charged with passionate desire for battle .
then you 'd not have seen lord agamemnon sleeping , hiding , or not keen to fight .
quite the reverse , he was moving out to combat , to man-ennobling war.he left his horses and ornate bronze chariot with his aide eurymedon , son of ptolemaeus , son of peiraeus , who held the panting horses at a distance .
for agamemnon had ordered him repeatedly to keep the horses ready for the time his limbsgrew tired from moving through so many soldiers .
he went around on foot , inspecting warrior ranks .
when he saw danaans coming up with horses , he 'd approach them , shouting words of encouragement :
argives , do n't lose your warlike spirit .
father zeus will never help those liars.by attacking us , these trojans were the first to violate their oaths .
vultures will gnaw awaytheir tender flesh , while we lead off their wives
but when agamemnon saw soldiers holding back from hateful war , he 'd lash out at them in anger
you cowards , disgraceful argives , are n't you ashamed ? what are you doing just standing here , like dazed fawns exhausted after runningover a large plain , now motionless , hearts drained of spirit—that 's how you stand , in a trance , not marching up to battle.are you waiting for trojans to come closer , up to the fine sterns of our ships beached here , on the gray sea shore , so you can seeif the hand of cronos ' son will shield you ?
in this way , agamemnon moved around the army , exerting his authority throughout the ranks.going past crowds of men , he met the troops from crete , as they armed themselves round idomeneus , their fiery-hearted leader at the front , fierce as a wild boar .
looking at these two , agamemnon , king of men , rejoiced .
idomeneus , above all danaans , with their swift horses , i value you in war , in all other things , and at banquets , when achaea ’ s finest prepare gleaming wine , the kind reserved for kings , in mixing bowls .
other long-haired achaeans drink their portion , the amount allotted to them , but your cupalways stands full of wine , as does mine , so you can drink any time your heart desires.set off to battle , then—show you 're a man , the fine man you claimed to be before .
son of atreus , indeed i 'll prove myselfa loyal comrade to you , as i promised that first time long ago .
but you should rouseother long-haired achaean men to action , so we may fight at once , without delay.since trojans have broken their sworn promises , death and sorrow will come to them at last , for they attacked us first , breaking their oaths .
at these words , the son of atreus felt joy fill his heart.then he moved off .
as he continued on his way , he met both men called ajax , arming themselvesamong the hordes of troops , with crowds of men on foot .
just as a goatherd high on a lookout sees a cloudcoming down across the sea , driven by west wind 's force— something which at a distance seems pitch blackas it moves across the sea , driving a huge storm , and , shuddering at the sight , he takes his flocks into a cave—that ’ s how the dense ranks of young men , gods ' favourites , marched around both ajaxes , ready for war , all dressed in black , with shields and spears , seeing them , powerful agamemnon felt great joy—he shouted out to them in words with wings :
you two ajaxes , leaders of the argives armed in bronze , for you i have no orders .
it 's not right for me to urge you forward—both of you are rousing men to fight with all their force .
by father zeus , athena , and apollo , i wish such spirit would fill each man 's chest .
then king priam 's city would soon fall , we 'd capture it , destroy it utterly .
with these words , he left them there , going on to others.he met nestor , clear-voiced orator from pylos , setting his troops in order , urging them to fight
under huge pelagon , alastor , chromius , haemon , and mighty bias , his people 's shepherd.nestor set horses , chariots , and charioteers in front.in the rear , he placed his many brave foot soldiers , a battle wall .
first , he told the charioteers to control their horses , to avoid confusing the entire battle line :
in your eagerness to engage the trojans , do n't any of you charge ahead of others , trusting in your strength and horsemanship.and do n't lag behind .
that will hurt our charge.any man whose chariot confronts an enemy'sshould thrust with his spear at him from there .
thus that old man , skilled in war 's traditions , roused his men .
old man , how i wish the power in those knees of yourscould match the spirit in your chest , your strength remain unbowed .
if only that had happenedto some other man and left you in place , among the ranks of younger warriors .
son of atreus , yes , indeed , i wish i were the man i used to be back then , when i cut down lord ereuthalion.but gods do n't give men everything at once .
now old age follows me.but i 'll be with my horsemen , advising them ,
giving them their orders , an old man 's right.fighting with spears is for the younger menborn after me , men who rely on strength .
filled with joy , atreus ' son moved on.next , he came upon menestheus , peteos ' son , a charioteer , standing still among athenians , famous for their battle cries .
close by them , resourceful odysseus stood among his troops , cephallenian soldiers , powerful fighting men.these men had not yet heard the call to battle .
for the armies of horse-taming trojans and achaeans had only just begun to march against each other .
so odysseus ' soldiers stood waiting for the rest of the achaeansto charge against the trojans and begin the fight.seeing this , agamemnon , king of men , spoke out , rebuking them .
son of peteos , god-given king , and you , odysseus , skilled in sly deception , crafty minded , why are you holding back , standing apart ?
are you waiting for the rest ?
by rights you two should be with those in front , sharing the heat of battle .
at banquets , when we achaeans feast our senior men , you hear me call your name out first.then you like to have roast meat and cups of wine , honey sweet , to your heart 's content.but now you 'd be quite happy looking onif ten achaean groups were fighting here with ruthless bronze before your very eyes .
son of atreus , how can you say such things ?
how can you claim i 'm hanging back from battleeach time we achaeans rouse ourselves for waragainst horse-taming trojans ?
if you want ,
if it 's of interest to you , then you 'll seetelemachus ' dear father battlinghorse-taming trojans at the very front .
what you 've been saying is clearly nonsense .
mighty agamemnon saw the anger in odysseus.he smiled at him and took back what he 'd just said :
odysseus , you resourceful man , divinely born son of laertes , i 'm not finding serious fault with you.i 'm issuing no orders to you.i know that spirit in your loyal chest is well disposed .
we both are of one mind.if i 've said something bad we 'll make it good .
may the gods bring all of this to nothing .
with these words , agamemnon left odysseus there , moving on to other men .
he met diomedes , tydeus ' high-spirited son , standing by his horses and his well-made chariot .
beside him stood sthenelus , son of capaneus .
seeing them , agamemnonspoke out in rebuke .
tydeus was not a man to shirk like this .
that 's what they say , those who saw him work .
i never saw him for myself .
once he came to mycenaeas a peaceful guest with godlike polyneices , mustering men to assault the sacred walls of thebes.they begged us to give them worthy comrades.mycenaeans , willing to comply , agreed .
but then zeus later changed their minds , revealing an unlucky omen to them.so tydeus and polyneices left .
on their way , they reached the river asopus , its lush grassy meadows full of reeds .
he found cadmeans feasting in large numbers in the palace , home of great eteocles .
though a stranger , all by himself in that cadmean crowd , chariot fighter tydeus was not afraid.he challenged them in various contests.athena helped , so he won them all with ease.horse-breaking cadmeans were upset with him.they organized a strong ambush against him as he returned—fifty young men , with two leaders , that godlike hero maeon , haemon 's son , and warlike polyphontes , son of autophonus .
but these men came to fatal shameful ends.for tydeus killed them , all but one .
he let maeon go home , sent him away , in obedience to an omen from the gods .
that 's the man aetolian tydeus was.but his son is a lesser man than he , though better when it comes to talking .
mighty diomedes did not reply to agamemnon 's words , shamed at the rebuke from a king whom he respected.but sthenelus , son of famous capaneus , answered :
son of atreus , do n't spread lies .
you know the truth.we claim we 're far better than our fathers.we captured thebes , city of seven gates , leading smaller forces over stronger walls , trusting signs sent by the gods and zeus ' aid.the others died through their own foolishness.so do n't give our fathers honours high as mine .
follow my advice .
for i 'm not hurt that agamemnon , the army 's shepherd , urges armed achaeans on to battle .
for he will get the glory , if achaeans annihilate the trojans and capture sacred ilion .
and he 'll get great sorrow , if achaeans are wiped out .
but come , let 's get our two minds workingto rouse our spirits for this coming fight .
then with his weapons he jumped from his chariot down to the ground .
around his chestthe bronze rang fearfully , as he moved into action , a sound to make even brave warriors afraid .
just as thundering ocean surf crashes on the sand , wave after wave , driven by the west wind 's power , one wave rising at sea , then booming down on shore , arching in crests and crashing down among the rocks , spewing salt foam , so then danaan ranks , row after row , moved out , spirits firmly set on war .
the rest marched on in silence .
you 'd never thinksuch a huge army could move out with its voice buried in those chests , in silent fear of their commanders .
as for the trojans , they were like thousands of ewesstanding in a rich man 's farm , bleating constantly , waiting for someone to come and collect white milk , as they hear lambs call .
they shared no words—they had no common language , but mixtures of tongues , with men from many lands .
with them came terror , fear , and tireless strife , sister and companion of man-destroying ares— at first small in stature , she later grows enormous , head reaching heaven , as she strides across the earth .
strife went through crowds of soldiers , casting hatredon both sides equally , multiplying human miseries .
when the two armies came to one common ground , they smashed into each other—shields , spears , fierce angry men encased in bronze .
studded shields bashed one another.a huge din arose—human cries of grief and triumph , those killing and those killed .
earth flowed with blood.just as streams swollen with melting snows pour out , flow down the hill into a pool , and meet some torrent from a great spring in a hollow gully there , and the shepherd in the distant hills hears the roar— so the shouts and turmoil resounded then from warriors , as they collided .
antilochus was the first to kill a man— a well-armed trojan warrior , echepolus , son of thalysius , a courageous man , who fought in the front ranks .
he hit his helmet crest , topped with horsehair plumes , spearing his forehead.the bronze point smashed straight through the frontal bone .
darkness hid his eyes and he collapsed , like a tower , falling down into that frenzied battle .
as he fell , powerful elephenor , son of chalcodon , courageous leader of the abantes , seized his feet , and started pulling him beyond the range of weapons , eager to strip him of his armour quickly .
but elephenor 's attempt did not go on for long.great-hearted agenor saw him drag the dead man.he stabbed elephenor with his bronze spear , right in his exposed side , where his shield left himvulnerable as he bent down .
over his dead body , trojans and achaeans kept fighting grimly on , attacking like wolves , man whirling against man .
then ajax , son of telamon , hit simoeisius , anthemion 's son , a fine young warrior .
while his mother was coming down mount ida , accompanying her parents to watch their flocks.that 's why the people called him simoeisius.but he did not repay his fond parents for raising him.his life was cut short on great ajax 's deadly spear .
he collapsed in the dust , like a poplar tree , one growing in a large well-watered meadow , from whose smooth trunk the branches grow up to the top , until a chariot builder 's bright axe topples it , bends the wood , to make wheel rims for a splendid chariot , letting the wood season by the riverbank .
that 's how godlike ajax chopped down simoeisius , son of anthemion .
then antiphus , priam 's son , with his shining helmet , hurled his sharp spear at ajaxthrough a crowd of men .
he missed ajax , but hit leucus , a brave companion of odysseus , in the groin , as he was dragging simoeisius away.his hands let go .
enraged at leucus ' slaughter , odysseus strode up , through the front ranks , armed in gleaming bronze .
looking round , he hurled his glittering spear.as he threw , trojans moved back , but the spear found a mark .
it hit democoön , priam 's bastard son , who 'd come from abydos , where he bred horses for their speed.angry for his friend , odysseus speared him in the temple .
he called out to the trojans , shouting :
charge ahead , you horse-taming trojans.do n't make argives happy .
once you strike at themit ca n't stop flesh-ripping bronze .
and achilles , son of lovely thetis , is n't in this fight.he 's sitting by his ships , nursing his anger .
athena tritogeneia , mighty zeus ' daughter , rushed among achaeans , urging companies on , if she saw men holding back , hesitant to fight .
death then came to diores , son of amarynceus.he was hit by a jagged rock on his right shin , beside the ankle .
he fell onto his back down in the dust.there he reached out with both hands for his companions.his spirit left his body with each gasp he took .
peirous , who 'd thrown the rock , ran up and speared his gut.his bowels spilled out onto the ground .
thoas moved in to close quarters , pulled the heavy spear out from his chest , drew his sharp sword , then drove it straight into the middle of his belly , destroying peirous ' life .
but thoas could n't stripthe armour off .
for peirous ' companions , thracian men whose hair is piled atop their heads , rallied round , holding out long spears , forcing thoasaway from them .
and so those two warriors lay stretched out in the dirt beside each other— one thracian chief , one captain of bronze-clad epeians .
at that point , no man who joined in the battle there could take it lightly , not even one who strolled unhurt through the middle of the fight , untouched by that sharp bronze , with pallas athena escorting him by hand , shielding him from flying weapons .
for on that day , many trojans and achaeans lay there side by side , stretched out together , face down in the dust .
then pallas athena gave diomedes , son of tydeus , strength and courage , so among all argives , he 'd stand out and win heroic glory .
she made his helmet blaze with tireless flames , his shield as well—like a late star in summer which shines especially bright , newly risen from its bath in ocean 's streams .
around his head and shoulders the goddess put a fiery glow , then drove him forward , right into the middle of the strife , the killing zone , where most warriors fight .
among the trojans was a rich and honorable man called dares , priest of hephaestus .
moving forward in their chariot to the front , these two charged diomedes , who was on foot , staying on the ground .
when they were at close range , phegeus was the first to hurl his long-shadowed spear .
the weapon did not leave his hand and miss the target .
it hit phegeus right between the nipplesand knocked him from his splendid chariot .
he did n't dare protect his slaughtered brother 's corpse.even so , he would n't have escaped black doom , but hephaestus saved him with a dark cloud cover , so his aged father would n't waste away with grief.tydeus ' son , great diomedes , drove the horses off , then gave them to his comrades to take back to the ships.when great-hearted trojans saw those two sons of dares— one shunning battle , one dead beside his chariot— all their hearts were stirred .
then athena , eyes glittering , took her brother , headstrong ares , by the hand , and said to him :
ares , ares , insatiable man-killer , destroyer of cities , why do n't we leavetrojans and achaeans to fight it out ? father zeus will make one group victorious.let 's withdraw , avoiding zeus ' anger .
with these words , she led headstrong ares from the battle , then sat him down by scamander river bank .
first , agamemnon , king of men , threw huge odius , chief of the halizoni , from his chariot .
his spear first struck him in the back , between the shoulder blades , as he turned to flee .
odius pitched forward with a thud , his armour rattling round him as he fell .
idomeneus slaughtered phaestus , son of borus , a meonian , who 'd come from fertile tarne.with his long spear , skillful idomeneus struck him in his right shoulder , as he climbed in his chariot.dreadful darkness came and gathered phaestus in.those attending idomeneus stripped the armour .
then with his sharp spear menelaus , son of atreus , killed scamandrius , son of strophius , a huntsman .
artemis herself had taught him how to shootevery animal raised in the mountain forests.but archer artemis was no help to him then , no more than was his expertise in archery , at which he 'd been pre-eminent in former times .
for fine spearman menelaus , son of atreus , caught him as he ran away in front of him , hitting him in the back between his shoulder blades , forcing the spear right through scamandrius ' chest.he fell head first .
meriones then killed phereclus , son of tecton , harmon 's son , whose hands could make fine objects of all sorts .
pallas athena had a special love for him.he was the one who 'd made well-balanced ships for paris at the start of all the trouble , bringing disaster on the trojans and on paris , too , for he was ignorant of what gods had decreed.meriones went after phereclus as he ran off , hurled his spear straight into his right buttock .
then meges killed pedaeus , antenor 's bastard son .
theano had raised him with all care , loving him as one of her own children , to please her husband .
that famous spearman meges , son of phyleus , coming up close , drove a sharp spear in his neck , into the nape behind his head .
the bronze point , slicing under his tongue , smashed through his teeth .
eurypylus , euaemon 's son , killed lord hypsenor , son of proud dolopion , scamander 's priest , a man honoured by his people as a god .
going quickly after him , eurypylus struck at hypsenor 's shoulder—his sharp sword sliced off hypsenor 's brawny arm .
then death 's black night , all-powerful fate , moved in and stole away his sight .
as for diomedes , you could n't tell where he belonged , whether among the trojans or achaeans.for he rushed across the plain like a swollen river , like a swift winter torrent bursting dikes— no dam put in its way can hold it back , no barrier of fruitful vineyards check its current , as all at once it floods when storms from zeus roar down .
that 's how the son of tydeusdrove the dense ranks of trojans into mass confusion .
for all their numbers they could not contain him .
lycaon 's fine son saw diomedes moving fastalong the plain , pushing trojan ranks in front of him , in complete disorder .
he quickly bent his bow , taking aim at diomedes .
the sharp arrow went in there , kept going , and splattered blood down on the curving metal .
at this lycaon 's noble son gave out a noisy shout :
i do n't think he 'll long survive my arrow 's force , if apollo , son of zeus , really was the onewho put it in my heart to leave lycia .
that 's what lycaon 's son cried out , boasting aloud .
but his sharp arrow had n't killed diomedes , who moved back to stand beside his chariot and horses.he called to sthenelus , son of capaneus .
my friend , son of capaneus , come on , get down from the chariot , so you can pullthis sharp arrow from my shoulder for me .
diomedes , expert in war cries , then spoke this prayer :
if you 've ever loved my father , stood by his side in murderous combat , be my friend now.grant that i kill this man , that i comea spear 's throw from the one who hit meunexpectedly and now boasts about it , saying i wo n't see daylight for much longer .
take courage , diomedes , in this fight with trojans.i 've put your father 's strength into your chest , that shield-bearing horseman 's fearless power.and i 've removed the filter from your eyeswhich covered them before , so now , you 'll easily distinguish gods from men.if a god comes here and stands against you , do n't offer to fight any deathless one , except for aphrodite , zeus ' daughter.if she fights , cut her with your sharp bronze .
diomedes charged off , joining at once those soldiers fighting in the front , his spirit on fire to battle trojans , seized by frenzy three times greater than before .
he was like a lionslightly hurt by a shepherd guarding his sheep flock out in the wilds , when it jumps the wall into the pen .
but he 's not killed it .
the wound rouses the beast 's strength.the shepherd ca n't keep the charging lion from his sheep , who , left unguarded , panic .
so the lion , in his hot rage , leaps over the wide sheep-fold wall.that 's how strong diomedes went to fight the trojans in his angry fury .
first he killed astynous , and then hypeiron , a shepherd of his people.his bronze spear hit one right above the nipple .
his huge sword struck the other on the collar , by the shoulder , slicing through the shoulder bone , severing it from hypeiron 's neck and back.he left them there , to chase abas and polyidus , sons of old eurydamas , interpreter of dreams.the old man did n't visit them to explain their dreams , for mighty diomedes slaughtered both of them .
then diomedes went after xanthus and thoön , two sons of phaenops , both of whom he loved .
worn down by sad old age , he 'd have no other child , no person to inherit all his property.diomedes killed them , took the life they loved , leaving bitter grief and anguish for their father , who would n't welcome them back home from war alive .
diomedes then challenged two sons of priam , son of dardanus , both in a single chariot— echemmon and chromius .
just as a lionleaps onto cattle and snaps necks on the cows , some heifer grazing in the bushes , so tydeus 's son knocked them out of their chariot viciously , against their will .
he met lycaon 's son , a fine and powerful man .
standing close by , aeneas said to him :
pandarus , where 's your bow , your feathered arrows , your reputation as a splendid archer ? no man can match your expertise in that.no one in lycia can claim to be your better.come , raise your hands in prayer to zeus , then shoot an arrow at that man , whose force now dominates the field , hurting trojans badly , hacking limbs from many fine young men , unless , of course , it is some angry god , displeased with trojans ' sacrificial gifts .
aeneas , counselor to bronze-armed trojans , from all i see , i think that man must bethe warlike son of tydeus .
i 'm not surehe 's not a god .
but if he 's the mani think he is , the fierce son of tydeus , he could not be charging at us in this way without help from some god beside him , an immortal with a covering cloudaround his shoulders , the god who pushed asidethat sharp arrow which struck diomedes .
for i 've already shot an arrow at him , hit his shoulder through that moulded armour.i thought i 'd shipped him straight to hades.but i did n't kill him .
but we 've no horses here , no chariot for me to chase him in .
in storage in lycaon 's house somewhere there are eleven chariots , new ones , too .
beside each one
stand pairs of horses , munching wheat and barley.when i was coming here , old soldier lycaon , in his well-built home , gave me much advice.he told me to take chariots and horses when i lead trojans into the hot heart of war.but i did n't follow his advice .
if i had , things would have been much better for me.but i worried about the horses—they 'd lack foragewith so many men all crammed together , and they were used to eating very well.i left them and came to troy to fight on foot , relying on my expertise in archery.but that skill is apparently of little use.for already i 've hit two of their best men , tydeus ' son and the son of atreus .
i 've drawn blood from both of them , it 's true , but that just made them much more dangerous.it was a evil time , that day i tookmy curved bow off its peg to lead my lycians to lovely troy , a favour for prince hector .
if i get home and see with my own eyes my native land , my wife , my large and lofty home , let someone chop my head off on the spot , if i do n't smash this bow with my own handsand throw the pieces in the blazing fire.for me it 's been completely useless .
do n't talk like that .
things wo n't change at alluntil the two of us go out to challengediomedes with a chariot and horses , until we confront him with our weapons.come , get in my chariot .
then you 'll see how good these horses are from troas ' stock , skilled in rapid movement on the plain , in all directions , in pursuit or in retreat .
this pair will take us safely to the city , should zeus give victory to diomedes .
let 's go .
take the whip and glistening reins.i 'll leave you the horses , so i can fight.or if you fight him , i 'll control the horses .
aeneas , you should take the reins yourself , guide your own horses—for they will pullyour curving chariot that much betterwith a driver they 're accustomed to , if we must flee tydeus ' son this time.if they miss your voice , they may shy or panic , or refuse to charge straight into battle.then the son of great-hearted tydeusin his attack may kill us both , and leadthese swift horses off .
i 'll do battle with him—my spear will give him a sharp welcome .
they finished talking , climbed up together , and set off , riding out in a fine chariot , both keen to kill , driving the swift horses against tydeus ' son .
diomedes , son of tydeus , my heart'strue friend , i see two men approaching , eager to attack you , two powerful men , an outstanding team .
one 's pandarus , the skillful archer , who boasts he 's lycaon 's son.the other is aeneas , proud anchises ' son , that 's his claim .
his mother 's aphrodite.so come , let 's retire with the horses , in case our quick charge through front lines ends up costing you your precious life .
do n't talk of moving back .
for i know well
as they talked to each other of their strategy , the fast horses quickly brought the two men closer.lycaon 's worthy son spoke first , shouting out :
great spirited , warlike son of tydeus , that noble man , i see that my sharp arrow , a bitter shaft , did not destroy you.so now i 'll try to hit you with my spear .
you won ’ t last long.i think you 've given me a glorious triumph .
you 're wrong .
you have n't hit me .
in my view , this matter wo n't end for the two of you , until one of you falls dead , and his bloodsatisfies in full hard warlike ares .
that said , he threw his spear .
pandarus fell from the chariot , his brightly shining armour rattling round him .
the swiftly running horses swerved aside.then and there his life-force , his spirit , left him .
aeneas then leapt down with his long spear and shield , fearing achaeans would somehow haul away the corpse .
he held his spear in front , his round shield , too , with fearful shouts , fiercely eager to kill anyone who came up to confront him.the son of tydeus picked up a stone , a massive rock which no two men now alive could lift .
it hit aeneas ' hip , where thigh meets pelvis , what people call the hip joint.the boulder smashed the socket and both tendons round it.the rough edges on the rock scraped off his skin.falling to his knees , warlike aeneas stayed down , supporting himself with his strong hand on the ground.black night came down and covered both his eyes .
aeneas , king of men , would have perished there , if aphrodite , zeus ' daughter , had n't seen him right away .
meanwhile , sthenelus , son of capaneus , did not forget what diomedes , skilled in war cries , told him .
he pulled his sure-footed horses to one side , beyond the fight , tying the reins onto the rail , and then went after those fine-maned horses of aeneas.he drove the animals away from trojan lines towards well-armed achaeans .
there he gave them to his dear companion deïpylus , whom he esteemedabove all others the same age as himself , since they both thought alike .
then brave sthenelusclimbed back into his chariot , grabbed the shining reins , and raced the strong horses back , keen to rejoin diomedes .
but diomedes with his ruthless bronze had gone to run down aphrodite—knowing she was not a godwho could do much in battle , not one of those who control men 's wars .
she was no athena , no goddess strife , who destroys whole cities .
when he met her , great-hearted tydeus ' son charged , lunging with his sharp spear at aphrodite .
immortal divine fluid then flowed out , ichor , which circulates only in the blessed gods.they do n't eat food or drink down gleaming wine .
daughter of zeus , leave war and fights alone .
is n't it enough for you to fool around with feeble women ?
if you start loitering on the battlefield , i think the war will make you shake with terror , even though you learn about it from a distance .
aphrodite left in agony , distressed and fearful .
wind-swift iris came to her , led her off , out of the crowd , moaning in pain , her fair skin stained with blood .
she came across fierce ares , seated on the left flank of the fight , his spear and his fast horses resting on a cloud.falling on her knees , she implored her dear brother , pleading hard for his golden-bridled horses :
dear brother , save me .
give me your horses , so i may go back up to mount olympus , the immortals ' home .
my wound pains me a lot.a mortal man inflicted this wound on me , tydeus ' son , who 'd now fight father zeus himself .
at this , ares gave her his golden-bridled horses.she climbed up in the chariot , her fond heart suffering .
they flew on willingly.at once they reached the gods ' home , steep olympus.there wind-swift iris stopped the horses , untied themfrom the chariot , and gave them heavenly fodder.aphrodite threw herself into her mother 's lap , divine dione , who took her daughter in her arms , caressed her with her hand , then said :
proud diomedes , son of tydeus , wounded me , for i was carrying offaeneas , my dear son , away from battle.of all men , he 's the one i love the most.now grim war is not just trojans and achaeans , for danaans fight against immortals , too .
many of us living on olympus have been hurt by men in our attempts to bring harsh troubles on each other.ares suffered , too , when mighty otusand ephialtes , children of aloëus , tied him up in powerful manacles , then kept him prisoner in a brass jarfor thirteen months .
ares would 've died there , with all his war-lust , if their step-mother , fair eëriboea , had not told hermes.he stole ares secretly .
hera suffered , as well , when hercules , the powerful son of amphitryon , hit her right breast with a three-barbed arrow.she was wracked by pain beyond all cure .
with them huge hades also sufferedfrom a sharp arrow , when this same man , this hercules , a son of aegis-bearing zeus , shot him in pylos , among the corpses there , inflicting pain .
as she said this , with her hand dione cleaned away the ichoron aphrodite 's wrist , healing the hand , curing aphrodite of her pain .
looking on , athena and hera teased zeus , son of cronos :
father zeus , you wo n't get angry with me for what i say , will you ?
aphrodite , trying to coax some new achaean womaninto running off with one of those trojansshe loves so much , must have been caressingsome well-dressed achaean lady and scratchedher delicate hand on a golden brooch .
as the gods talked the matter over with each other , diomedes , expert at war cries , sought out aeneas .
though he knew apollo himself was shielding him , he had no fear at all of that great god , pushing on to kill aeneas , then strip his fine armour from him.three times he charged forward , in a frenzy for the kill.three times apollo pushed back his shining shield.but when for the fourth time he came on like a god , apollo , the far shooter , in a terrifying voice , cried out :
take care , son of tydeus .
go back.do n't think you 're equal to the gods.the race of men who walk upon the groundcan never match the race of deathless gods .
at these words , the son of tydeus drew back somewhat , avoiding the anger of apollo , the far shooter.apollo put aeneas some distance from the fight , on sacred pergamus , where his temple stood .
there , in the large shrine , leto and artemis , the archer goddess , healed aeneas , restoring him to his former power and magnificence .
apollo of the silver bow then made an image , a copy of aeneas , with matching armour , around which trojans and brave achaeans fought , hacking away at ox-hide covering their chests , at the round shields or smaller shields with fringes .
murderous ares went in among the trojan ranks , inspiring the troops.in the shape of acamas , thracian leader , he yelled at priam 's royal sons :
you sons of priam , that god-nurtured king , why are you still allowing the achaeans to keep slaughtering your troops ?
are you waitinguntil they fight by the well-built city gates ? there lies great-hearted anchises ' son , aeneas , whom we honour as we do prince hector .
come , let 's save our brave comrade from the battle roar .
hector , where 's that courage you used to have ?
you kept claiming you could guard the city on your own , without your people or your allies , using your own family and relatives.looking round now , i ca n't see them here , any of them .
those of uswho 've come as allies , we do all the fighting.i marched here as an ally , traveling far , for lycia is a long , long way from here , by the swirling river xanthus , where i leftmy dear wife , my infant son , much property , something poor men covet .
but for all that , i urge my lycian troops to action , i stand and fight all comers on my own , when i 've nothing for the enemy to take .
waving two sharp spears , he roamed through all the army , rousing men to fight , steeling hearts for dreadful war.troops rallied once more and turned to face achaeans .
argives , too , stood firm .
the men did not withdraw .
as on the sacred threshing floor wind blows the chaff , while men stand winnowing the crop , when demeter , with her golden hair , separates the grain from chaff in the rushing breeze , and piles of chaff grow whiter , so then achaean troops grew white , covered with duststirred up by horses ' hooves .
so the chariots came on to battle once again , wheeled round by drivers ' strong ferocious hands .
headstrong ares assisted trojans in the battle , concealing them in darkness , roaming everywhere , carrying out his orders from phoebus apollo , god with the golden sword , who 'd told him to arouse the trojans ' spirits when he saw pallas athena leave the fighting , for she was helping the danaans .
apollo then sent aeneas from his costly shrine , putting fighting strength into this warrior 's heart , his people 's shepherd .
aeneas rejoined his friends , who were overjoyed to see him safe and sound—alive—approaching with brave spirits .
they had too much other work at hand to do .
then the two ajaxes , odysseus , and diomedes roused danaans , urging them to battle .
they did not fear the trojans ' powerful attack and stood their ground like clouds set in place by zeus , son of cronos , above a range of mountain peaks on a windless day , quite motionless , while the force of north wind and other raging blasts is sound asleep .
when these storm winds blow , they scatter shadowy clouds.that 's the way danaans held their positions then , without flinching , without fear .
my friends , be men .
let courage fill your hearts.in the heat of battle remember honour , each man 's reputation .
he hit a good fighting man , comrade to aeneas , great-hearted deïcoön , son of pergasus , whom trojans honoured as they did king priam 's sons , for he was quick to take his place among the best , the men who do their fighting at the very front .
mighty agamemnon 's spear struck against his shield , but the shield could not hold out—the bronze went through , piercing deïcoön 's belt and sinking in his gut.he fell with a thud , his armour rattling round him .
then aeneas killed two of the best danaans , crethon and orsilochus , whose father livedin well-built phere , a man of property , descended from the river alpheus , whose broad streamsflow through pylian land .
the river bore orsilochus , king of many men , and orsilochus fathered great-hearted diocles , to whom were born twin sons ,
war-loving menelaus felt pity for these two , seeing them die .
he made his way through the men 's front ranks , armed in glittering bronze , brandishing his spear .
he hurried through the foremost ranks , in his concernfor this shepherd of the people , that if he came to grief , all their efforts would be completely futile.menelaus and aeneas , now faced each other , with eager hands and spears , ready to begin the fight.but when antilochus stood by menelaus , aeneas , though a swift fighter , started to withdraw , seeing these two men standing their ground together .
so menelaus and antilochus dragged the corpsesof crethon and orsilochus to achaean troops , placed the two dead heroes in the hands of friends , then turned back to fight with those in the front ranks .
antilochus and menelaus then killed pylaemenes , a man like ares , leader of the paphlagonians , great-hearted , shield-bearing men .
the son of atreus , famous spearman menelaus , struck him , as he stood up in his chariot , hitting him right on his collar bone .
antilochus hit mydon , atymnius ' noble son , the attendant driver , as he was wheeling his sure-footed horses round.he struck him with a rock square on the elbow .
he ran against them , shouting wildly , with strong trojan soldiers in support.leading these men came ares along with fearful strife , bringing war 's pitiless and murderous confusion .
ares worked with a huge spear in his hands , moving round , sometimes behind hector , sometimes in front of him.when diomedes , skilled in war cries , noticed ares , he shuddered—just a man crossing a large plainstops at a raging river rushing to the sea , looks helplessly at swirling foam , and moves away—so tydeus ' son backed off then , saying to his men :
but he 's always got some god beside him , to ward off destruction .
right now , it 's areshe 's has with him , looking like a mortal man.stay turned towards the trojans , but fall back.do n't try to fight it out with gods .
trojans then approached much closer.hector killed two men , keen warriors—menesthesand anchialus—both riding in a single chariot .
