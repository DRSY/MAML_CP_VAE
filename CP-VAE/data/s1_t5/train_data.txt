0	but old age , our common enemy , has worn you down
0	then i bitterly attacked my crewmen ,
0	to carry ships and men on their way home
0	so , good sir , respect the gods
0	he turned them loose to feed inside the lovely yard , while he talked to odysseus ,
0	whom immortal gods hold dear
0	i would not rob him
0	with a dazzling thunderbolt i myself
0	why do you need this ?
0	she came up and began to wash her master
0	he may feel pity for us
0	that 's what troops muttered , both trojan and achaean
0	his heart was pitiless :
0	the kind of father you were born from
0	furthest out to sea
0	now a great work of war awaits you , the sort of enterprise you used to love
0	though i live in a palace far away
0	and take out his revenge in his own hall ,
0	a lethal fate to trojans
0	let a stranger slice this head off my neck
0	removed the virgin 's belt and made her sleep
0	take the whip and glistening reins
0	and people listened to him as if he were a god
0	for phoebus apollo had made them all fall back in an amazing panic
0	holds her head and eyebrows high above them all , so recognizing her is easy , though all of them
0	one of those arrogant young men
0	where on this wide earth do you intend to roam ,
0	but her intent is different
0	till then he would been treated always like a god
0	that 's what lycaon 's son cried out , boasting aloud
0	then she left for her mighty father 's well-built home
0	where one finds the cave of eilithyia ,
0	came down , and we slept there on the shore
0	the age of the socratic man is over ; put on wreaths of ivy , put the thyrsus into your hand , and do not be surprised when tigers and panther lie down , fawning , at your feet
0	arete then told her servants to set a large cauldron full of water on the fire as quickly as they could
0	he pays his tribute
0	did you not see
0	he called their finest men together , all the ones who commanded trojans troops , with all their rulers
0	but without myth every culture loses the healthy natural power of its creativity : only a horizon defined by myths completes and unifies a whole cultural movement
0	but come now , all of us should follow what i say
0	then warriors got up for the spear-throw competition—the son of atreus , wide-ruling agamemnon , and meriones , courageous attendant to lord idomeneus
0	or if he would send him off towards the city :
0	it 's not yet time to sleep here in the halls ,
0	as he fell , war-loving lycomedes pitied him
0	among some folk who spoke a foreign language ,
0	as many as you want—in my hut twenty one stand against the sunny wall , trojans spears i take from warriors i kill
0	that 's how sweet passion has seized hold of me , how much i want you now
0	argive helen sat there , too , with her attendant ladies , directing servants in their famous handicrafts
0	but her mind is full of other things
0	for we now understand what it means to wish to see tragedy and at the same time to long to get beyond all seeing : referring to the artistically employed dissonances , we should have to characterize the corresponding state by saying that we desire to hear and at the same time long to get beyond all hearing
0	circe , who will be the guide on such a journey ?
0	in all their pride they keep on plotting wretched things for me
0	danaans were driven back among their hollow ships in a rout , and the noisy tumult never stopped
0	then the trusty swineherd called out to his companions :
0	so come , let the steward begin to pour
0	do not let trojans kill achaeans off like this
0	that way he might come to recognizewhether or not we are of some use to him
0	in the stern part of the ship , the falling mast
0	yet even so , he could not revive him
0	but long-haired achaeans kept on shooting , attempting to hit hector with rocks and arrows
0	you should honour other men , your neighbours ,
0	and then we threw a cloak on top of him
0	it appears as the will , taking that world in schopenhauer 's sense , that is , as the opposite to the aesthetic , pure , contemplative , will-less state
0	so come now , tell me this ,
0	will die without a name in ithaca
0	with cruel intentions can invade the lands
0	then zeus planned the destruction of his men
0	flying on the right , when he departed
0	lord mulius , attending on amphinomus ,
0	achilles attacked , as well , heart full of savage anger , covering his chest with that richly decorated shield , his shining four-ridged helmet nodding on his head , the golden plumes hephaestus had set there shimmering around the crest
0	against godlike odysseus and did not relent until he reached his native land
0	beneath wide heaven—the city he wiped out
0	when i go to him , i can provide no help
0	and taken many splendid gifts away
0	it was so soft and shone out like the sun
0	from all these , great-hearted achilles took the fat , using it to cover up the corpse from head to foot , piling skinned carcasses around it
0	we will find them right before the gates , where i ordered them to meet the sentries
0	you are speaking to a man who thinks things through
0	that god was apollo , son of zeus and leto
0	standing by achilles , she clasped his hand , then said :
0	beyond ogygia—it 's called syrie ,
0	it 's a bad thing to chatter like the wind
0	out of this house , and they would be miserable
0	your bones will lie rotting here in trojan soil , recalling the work we failed to finish
0	though only for the briefest moment ,
0	wise meriones then replied :
0	up now , divinely born patroclus , master horseman
0	hector , i suppose you thought you could safely strippatroclus , without giving me a thought , since i was far away
0	if , however , in the exemplification here indicated , we have rightly associated the disappearance of the dionysian spirit with a most striking , but hitherto unexplained , transformation and degeneration of the hellenic man -- what hopes must revive in us when the most certain auspices guarantee the reverse process , the gradual awakening of the dionysian spirit in our modern world !
0	three times godlike achilles yelled across that ditch
0	but what i can do with my hands and feet and my own power , i will do
0	if you are with me now as eagerly
0	i washed my hands in a protected spot ,
0	with this sword odysseus struck leiodes right on the neck—
0	as we roamed across the misty waters ,
0	in fact , they seem to have felt this way
0	with these words , swift-footed iris went away
0	i set off for aeolus ' splendid palace ,
0	they asked him all kinds of questions
0	from his eyes then
0	athena took good care to veil him in thick mist , so no bold phaeacian who ran into him
0	hephaestus , though slow , has now caught ares ,
0	who gave him hospitality and kindness
0	well now , there 's an agile man !
0	then he kissed his dear son and held him in his arms
0	the world symbolism of music for this very reason can not in any way be overcome by or reduced to language , because music addresses itself symbolically to the primordial contradiction and pain in the heart of the original oneness , and thus presents in symbolic form a sphere which is above all appearances and prior to them
0	his hair—it flowed up like a flowering hyacinth
0	once my sharp bronze killed him , i ran off to a ship without delay ,
0	disastrous advice to my companions :
0	cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids
0	so i am telling you to do as follows—
0	when lord odysseus , who had endured so much , saw him worn down with age and carrying so much heavy sorrow in his heart ,
0	had fallen over it , and so with that
0	that 's the only thing that spared the argivesand saved their ships beached on the shore
0	comrades who followed him , i gathered up
0	menelaus , son of atreus and cherished of zeus ,
0	i know how to charge into the frenzyof fast chariots , and i know how to danceto ares ' tune in the grim killing zone
0	wherever we encounter the naïve in art , we have to recognize the highest effect of apollonian culture , something which always must come into existence to overthrow the kingdom of the titans , to kill monsters , and through powerfully deluding images and joyful illusions to emerge victorious over the horrific depths of what we observe in the world and the most sensitive capacity for suffering
0	in that case , you are an old friend of my father
0	eurymachus , i am not requesting you to furnish me with guides
0	beside nestor stood young men holding five-pronged forks
0	i might even assert that in goethe 's proposed nausikaa it would have been impossible to make the suicide of that idyllic being ( which was to be carried out in the fifth act ) grippingly tragic , for the power of the apollonian epic is so extraordinary that it magically transforms the most horrific things through that joy in and redemption through appearances right before our very eyes
0	his spirit urged him to glut ares , warrior god with the bull 's hide shield , on hector 's blood , more so than on the blood of any other man
0	then peisander made straight for glorious menelaus
0	alive or dead , he told me he would heard nothing
0	it is a shroud for warrior laertes , for the day a lethal fate will strike him
0	let there be one in charge , one ruler , who receives from crooked-minded cronossceptre and laws , so he may rule his people
0	as he spoke , our hearts collapsed , terrified
0	swift-footed achilles then said in reply :
0	hector was convinced by his advice
0	it almost reached his chin
0	all poetic art and poeticizing
0	he heard the crashing of the sea against the rocks—
0	others , however , have not been deterred from this blasphemous assertion
0	the bronze went straight on through , severed his belt , then drove low in his stomach
0	with these words , he drove themon
0	smoke rising in the middle of the island , through dense brush and trees
0	all these things have thus come to an end
0	lord odysseus , who had endured so much , held him
0	then you can offer me a gift , as your guest
0	in all phaeacia , from whom you yourself
0	once our swords have sliced your strength from you , we will mix your property , all the things you have inside your home
0	the premise of the opera is a false belief concerning the artistic process : the idyllic belief that every sentient man is an artist
0	woman , tell me the truth
0	but i will describe for you
0	his spear hit hypsenor , son of hippasus , his people 's shepherd , low down in the liver
0	friends , this marker herebelongs to me
0	from inside the hut patroclus heard him
0	then he left his room , his face resembling a god 's
0	with these words , the goddess set the armour down before achilles
0	but at that hour when the morning star appears , announcing that light is coming to the earth , the star after which dawn in her yellow robe moves out across the sea , by then the fire was dying
0	each man 's heart sank to his feet
0	good nurse , they are all enemies hatching evil plans ,
0	here and there along his vineyard slopes
0	athena spoke and thus swayed his foolish wits
0	my loyal companions feasted for six days—
0	even if he 's living in a wealthy home ,
0	she said i alone should listen to them
0	poetry , in other words , was subservient
0	an irrepressible laughter then pealed out
0	in zeus ' heart the best idea seemed to beto send out a wicked dream to agamemnon
0	i swear to you , agelaus , by zeus
0	then a vagrant from the community arrived ,
0	men or women in his household , knew
0	he was easily the best , your father ,
0	or welcome strangers and fear god in their hearts
0	that 's what hector thought as he stood there waiting
0	not in the usual way , but at sunset
0	but when he hears you are still alive , his heart feels joy , for every day he hopeshe will see his dear son come back home from troy
0	and thus avoid destruction
0	old chryses burned them on split wood , poured wine on them
0	as his mind and heart were thinking about this ,
0	that have overcome him
0	and nothing would have separated us
0	has buried them , although they live on still
0	as he moved , going after peleus ' son among those crowds of men , he did not go unnoticed
0	black night concealed the heavens , and no one noticed us or was aware
0	and fair-haired menelaus , the last one
0	throughout the army , in the ranks , they ate their dinner
0	but leave me there , in case old man nestor
0	telemachus then called out to his companions
0	that 's what the suitors said
0	her mother loaded on a box full of all sorts of tasty food
0	he then told competitors to shoot the dove
0	someone who herded sheep , but with a refined air that marks the sons of kings
0	come then , let 's do what black night demands—prepare a meal
0	odysseus , when we look at you , we do not perceive
0	to leave this house , for he 's very worried
0	when hector saw agamemnon going back , he gave a loud shout to the lycians and trojans :
0	crafty odysseus smiled at him and said :
0	those dear companions scylla snatched away
0	though you are keen to go , let my servants fetchthose presents from my ship and bring them here , so you can see if you approve of them
0	just as the sun began to shine down on the fields , rising from the gently flowing ocean depths , climbing in the sky , the two groups met each other
0	but when he re-launched
0	great hector of the shining helmet then replied :
0	as he fell , his head , mouth , and nose hit the earth well before his knees , and ajax cried to brave polydamas :
0	with her immortal sea nymphs to look on
0	i wo not let anyone who 's touched my food
0	in the centre lay two golden talents , to be awarded to the one among them all who delivered the most righteous verdict
0	while they were slaughtering the sailors there ,
0	that 's how the gods then talked to one another
0	it sailed beyond the marks of all the other men , speeding lightly from his hand , and athena ,
0	for i am ashamed to stand stark naked
0	then peneleus and lycon charged each other
0	stay there and sit with him
0	or if you fight him , i will control the horses
0	but he says he will not return that noble lady , wife of menelaus , though the trojans wishhe ’ d do that
0	a nurse went , too , carrying the child
0	they bring fresh water
0	tell him he can move among the suitors
0	so as their tempers heated up , they both grew angry on the polished threshold by the lofty doors
0	with a sharp bronze point
0	you will get the credit for what they begin
0	if only that had happenedto some other man and left you in place , among the ranks of younger warriors
0	zeus ' daughter aphrodite answered her :
0	only to be butchered by my own hearth ,
0	you claimyour family stems from a broad flowing stream , but i boast a family coming from great zeus
0	you will learn about these thingswhen all the immortals do—the evil planszeus is proposing , something , in my view , which wo not please all hearts alike , in gods or men , although some may still enjoy our feast
0	meanwhile at dawn odysseus and the loyal swineherd , once they would sent the herdsmen out with droves of pigs , made a fire in the hut and prepared their breakfast
0	what country is this ?
0	if he would done what the son of peleus had told him , he would have missed his evil fate , his own dark death
0	glorious hector then said to ajax in reply :
0	to any city , any land
0	the two of them went inside the inner chamber of the hollow cave and lay down beside each other to make love
0	gathering all sorts of goods , another man
0	here , you can soon add up
0	a nasty night came on
0	father zeus , if , in wheat-yielding argos , any man has ever burned fat thighs of bulls or sheep in sacrifice to you , praying for his return , and you answered him , nodding your head and promising assent , olympian god , remember that
0	the shade of my companion speaking out
0	on your broad shoulders , then fix that fine oar in the ground there , and make rich sacrifice to lord poseidon with a ram , a bull ,
0	the huge rock door , drove his rich flock outside ,
0	strong diomedes , with a scowl , answered sthenelus :
0	is stirring up a nasty fight against us ,
0	just as some god sends a breeze to sailors in distress , when they work themselves too hard rowing out at sea , bodies broken with fatigue at their polished oars—that 's how these two looked to the long-suffering trojans
0	to drink , the water there was swallowed up
0	half the white milk and set aside the whey
0	wise penelope then said to him :
0	i think the brains and blood of many suitors
0	she rushed down from olympus ' peak
0	ares urged the trojans on , while bright-eyed athena kept rousing the achaeans
0	so with a heavy heart
0	but since he 's picked up his thieving habits ,
0	it had a silver cross-piece
0	and struck the mules
0	or in the sea , being tossed around by waves
0	prepare to win the contests
0	as she left this house , would call upon
0	the two hatched a plan against the suitors ,
0	we will ship you off at once
0	inside the city , when tribes of men get old ,
0	as he comes home
0	i will make that sacrifice to you , and more— on that beast i will plate both horns with gold
0	those complaints of yours are not unjustified
0	to make me miserable
0	but she replied and said :
0	he jabbed his spear into the life-giving earth , and then spoke to that shepherd of his people as a friend :
0	a dreadful panic on my comrades
0	thanks to favours from the gods , you have
0	the bronze sliced through his hand into the bow
0	to visit many lands collecting wealth
0	boat oars , and well-trimmed ships , in which with joy they cross the gray salt sea
0	or did it turn itself around ?
0	not while i am alive , gazing on the earth
0	he kept looking round , like a bearded lion which dogs and men chase off— with spears and shouts they drive it from the farm
0	she made her taller , too , and changed her figure , so it looked more regal
0	who was sitting there beside her
0	but when they reached the middle of the crowded meeting , with quick beats of their wings they wheeled around ,
0	and he 's not worth a damn
0	they brought off the offerings to archer god apollo
0	i stayed there seven years , the entire time ,
0	the island is not poor
0	but now one of you
0	in a corner , terrified
0	all his skin was swollen , and sea water flowed in streams up in his mouth and nose
0	with this insight a culture is inaugurated that i venture to call a tragic culture
0	achilles ' noble heart moaned aloud
0	we were no longer disconcerted at witnessing his style
0	and then grant all other men of pylos
0	ajax , one of the godsdwelling on olympus , in a prophet 's shape , tells us both to fight on by the ships
0	melanthius finished , and as he moved on past them , in his stupidity he kicked odysseus on the hip
0	my dark heart thinking , as i walked , of many things
0	who has fixed our swift ship out at sea as she was racing homeward ,
0	hector , you asked me to tell you the truth
0	to the swineherd and the keeper of the goats
0	that infallible old man of the sea
0	like the gods who occupy wide heaven
0	that i should at all costs miss this island ,
0	wine restores strength well in a weary man , and you have grown tired guarding your own family
0	she does not lack
0	and give some news to wise penelope
0	their hearts dismayed , and they departed from the hall , past the large courtyard wall
0	this opposition became more dubious and even impossible as similar impulses gradually broke out from the deepest roots of hellenic culture itself
0	hermes the deliverer conducted them along the murky passageway
0	i do not think he went hometo cheer up his dear wife and worthy parentson his own two feet
0	total disaster , if we chance to meet
0	afraid i might reprimand him harshly
0	but if i sow a lethal fate for them ,
0	your mother wo not set you on your funeral bed , lamenting over you
0	you men who are more powerful than me ,
0	phaeacian power and strength depend on him
0	telemachus , may zeus , hera 's loud-thundering husband ,
0	were four , the sons of dolius six , and with them dolius and laertes , though they had gray hair ,
0	do not hide it
0	slitting the throats of two of them , achilles tossed them on the pyre
0	penelope paused , then spoke to eurynome ,
0	if not , then i will take a prize myself by force , something from you or ajax or odysseus
0	in bowls for him to drink up with his dinner
0	where people of the town collect their water ,
0	melanthius poured their wine
0	he would had the bad luck to meet godlike achilles
0	after its trip across the misty seas ,
0	let us mark this well : the alexandrian culture , to be able to exist permanently , requires a slave class , but with its optimistic view of life it denies the necessity of such a class , and consequently , when its beautifully seductive and tranquilizing utterances about the dignity of man and the dignity of labor are no longer effective , it gradually drifts toward a dreadful destruction
0	whoever strikes at you will have to fight
0	his belly tells him to move in against the flocks ,
0	but now the gods with their malicious plans
0	after his meal , he easily rolled back
0	and many other men lay dead around them
0	said these words and left
0	hurry and carry him outside the house ,
0	who came with me on my trip from pylos
0	in his beaked ships
0	here , in silence , we brought our ship to land ,
0	i won her with my spear , once i would destroyedher strong-walled city
0	with hospitality , and questions him
0	listen to me , those of you who are courting
0	to be king is not something evil
0	calypso , the lovely goddess , had told him to keep this star on his left as he moved across the sea
0	hostile troops are camped close by
0	the army streamed out , foot soldiers and charioteers , making a huge din
0	so tell me this—
0	picked up in her firm grip a curved key made of bronze—
0	it 's disgraceful how such wretched cowards want to lie
0	how can the ugly and the disharmonic , the content of the tragic myth , stimulate aesthetic pleasure ?
0	that ’ s what i said
0	the godlike minstrel demodocus , the man
0	should by rights attend
0	from the other , cold water comes , as cold as hail or freezing snow or melting ice , even in summer
0	you are sleeping , son of fiery atreus , tamer of horses
0	peiraeus , we do not know how these matters will turn out
0	some hurried to bring in the dead , others to find wood
0	they set it alight
0	then , sick at heart ,
0	then telemachus climbed up
0	with a heavy heart ,
0	and then tell him
0	with these words , lord achilles conducted them inside his hut and seated them on chairs covered with purple rugs
0	achaeans troops missed his presence there among them
0	they raced on board , went to their places ,
0	but we would be ashamed by public gossip
0	my cunning name had pulled off such a trick
0	and set it in a finely-polished rack , which held many other spears belonging to odysseus
0	with an uncommon wisdom
0	now they are ashamed of you
0	with these words , athena seduced him forward
0	that 's how the soldiers talked together
0	then lycaon 's knees gave way , his heart collapsed
0	i will give him some of it and send him off
0	and roams mountain slopes and grassy valleys seeking pasture , and then the lion comes
0	come now , when the long-haired achaeans leave , sailing their ships to their dear native land , you can smash their wall , take it out to sea , bury the great shore under sand , and so erasethat great achaean wall completely
0	in these three basic forms of optimism lies the death of tragedy
0	for my good news—let me have fine clothing ,
0	one 's family gets rich immediately ,
0	while you lead us to circe 's sacred home
0	i will get the glory
0	skilled in making lovely things
0	then wise penelope replied :
0	apollo would not let panthous ' son be killed among those fighting in the front
0	whenever they intended to retire to bed
0	old man , in our assembly once againyou win out over all achaea 's sons
0	but now , since the time you left for pylos ,
0	and divinely born odysseus , sacker of cities ,
0	i will not speak of , nor could i recite ,
0	servants carrying bread , plenty of meat ,
0	while in the theatre daytime might be only artistic and stage architecture only symbolic , and the nature of the metrical language might have an ideal quality , nevertheless , on the whole , a misconception still ruled : it was not enough , schiller claimed , that people merely tolerated as poetic freedom what was the essence of all poetry
0	people will forgetthat wall which phoebus apollo and myselfworked hard to build for heroic laomedon
0	and that 's the reason
0	daughter of a wealthy man , and compete
0	aeneas then leapt down with his long spear and shield , fearing achaeans would somehow haul away the corpse
0	her dear nurse eurycleia
0	even if he slanders you and calls you coward , he will not convince the trojans or dardanians , or trojan wives , married partners of brave menyou have thrown into the dirt , still in their prime
0	but with the food
0	achilles told patroclus , his companion , to sacrifice to all the gods
0	while the disaster gradually slumbering in the womb of theoretical culture gradually begins to frighten modern man , and he anxiously ransacks the stores of his experience for means to avert the danger , though he has no great faith in these means ; while he , therefore , begins to divine the consequences of his situation -- great men , universally gifted , have contrived , with an incredible amount of thought , to make use of the paraphernalia of science itself , to point out the limits and the relativity of knowledge generally , and thus to deny decisively the claim of science to universal validity and universal aims
0	the shimmering river waters were held back
0	give me the polished bow , so here among you
0	achaeans quickly led their fast horses back from bouprasium to pylos , all of thempaying tribute among all the gods to zeus , and among all men to nestor
0	cold water flowed down from a rock above , and on the top of that
0	he followed in her footsteps
0	together with the spirit in my crew ,
0	is pessimism necessarily the sign of collapse , destruction , and disaster , of the exhausted and enfeebled instinct , as it was among the indians , as it is now , to all appearances , among us modern peoples and europeans ?
0	against poseidon , my father 's brother ,
0	a lengthy voyage , to do away with me
0	you are keen for me to marry—you must wait
0	saying this , hector swung his whip down from his shoulders , lashing on his horses , calling trojans in the ranks
0	shortly i shall also indicate by name the forces which seem to me to guarantee a new birth of tragedy and who knows what other blessed hopes for the german character !
0	of making love , then entertained each other telling stories , in mutual conversation
0	brings the same delight a brother does
0	now asius is avenged !
0	has always been that way and forces you
0	just as any man
0	the power of watery winds could not get through , none of helios ' rays could pierce it , and the rain would never penetrate
0	where fair-haired circe lived , fearful goddess
0	and met their fate alongside agamemnon
0	all bewitched by circe 's wicked potions
0	the entire plain dried up
0	when rose-fingered dawn came up , they gathered around that pyre of glorious hector
0	you do not consider this , do not think at all
0	achaea 's sons apportioned it all fairlyamongst themselves
0	once he would eaten his heart 's fill and had enough , eumaeus filled the bowl from which he drank himself and gave it to him full of wine
0	it 's flooding through me , overpowering the hearthere in my chest—not even when i lusted for
0	ajax 's spear struck him first on the peak of his horse-plumed helmet
0	resourceful odysseus went into his hut , then slung across his shoulder his finely decorated shield and set off with them , to find noble diomedes , son of tydeus
0	great spear-fighting myrmidons reached home safely , led by the glorious son of brave achilles ,
0	the achaean elders gathered round achilles , urging him to eat
0	then he questioned him :
0	to fight against the trojans
0	never gets back home
0	the old man came up out of the water ,
0	aeneas then shouted out , addressing hector :
0	then said to eumaeus :
0	their hearts had not responded to what he would just said
0	in her right hand she held out in a golden cup some honey wine , so the men could pour libations before setting out
0	but now he 's died by some pitiful fate
0	in word or deed
0	these swift abantes came with elephenor , their hair grown long behind , warrior spearmen , filled with fierce desire to tear apart their enemies , to pierce armed bodies with their long ash spears
0	my queen , for he tells the kind of stories
0	old man , from the way you tend this orchard
0	i came home , and the immortals gave me
0	come now , let 's give back argive helen
0	without being noticed and remind them all
0	misery like this , all this suffering , is not for us alone
0	so eurymachus struck a person serving wine
0	on sea-girt dia killed ariadne ,
0	then he took a wife , built a high-roofed house , and fathered two strong sons , antiphates and mantius
0	telemachus ' exact age is not known , but he must be in his mid to late teens , since he was a young child when odysseus left for troy about thirteen years previously
0	flowing oceanus : oceanus or ocean is a river which in homeric geography surrounds the lands and the sea—it is , as it were , the outer rim of the world ( which is flat )
0	their masters ' chariots , fully covered , remained stationed in the huts
0	immortal gods who dwell on mount olympus no longer disagree about all this
0	the many rival contests where phaeacians
0	then we will come up to the city
0	the best thing i could do
0	earthshaker poseidon then answered him and said :
0	autolycus , you must personally find
0	against huge rocks in a perilous place
0	that how odysseus was coming out to meet those fair-haired girls ,
0	without tears , their hearts so deeply moved
0	for it 's grand to listen to a singer
0	to follow on your route—for you yourself
0	from that place i drifted for nine days
0	to those other men to go home at once
0	but if the gods decline , i say we stop
0	so keep on after them
0	even a human man , though mortal and ignorant of what i know , can achieve what he intends for someone else
0	you were always gentle
0	to whom she 's well disposed she can resolve
0	here , take a remedial potion with you ,
0	just as you honoured me , striking hard against achaeans then , so now , grant me what i pray for—remove disaster , this wretched evil , from the danaans
0	in the whole flock by far
0	to the farmyard of a man who understands
0	with long pointed leaves stands at the harbour head , and close beside it there 's a pleasant shadowy cave , sacred to the nymphs whom people call the naiads
0	so come , let 's all agree to what i say
0	an old sicilian woman
0	let 's end this competition
0	his leg fell in the basin , and the bronze rang out
0	eurycleia , once she saw the bodies and huge amounts of blood , was ready to cry out for joy now that she would seen such a mighty act
0	achilles , you may be the most powerful of men , but you are inflicting too much damage here
0	among the trojans that he was odysseus
0	where are you from ?
0	people closely connected to the gods
0	they do not let me join them past the river
0	that you are a strong , fine-looking man ,
0	immediately sent my men bad omens—
0	but hector has the power of deadly fire
0	waiting for your word
0	i once entertained a man , someone who would come
0	they would given up all hope for hector 's safety
0	the real joy for the greek in this dialectical solution is so great that a sense of powerful serenity invests the entire work , which breaks the sting of the dreadful pre-conditions which started the process
0	once she would finished , i answered her :
0	stay calm , mother , even though you are upset
0	know if i have seen him or heard any news
0	he bears those , too , though much against his will
0	i can make sincere suggestions to him
0	but your heart and wicked acts
0	two swift dogs went with him
0	with this canon at hand , euripides measured all the individual features and justified them according to this principle : the language , characters , dramatic construction , the choral music
0	they have become their god 's timeless servants , living beyond all regions of society
0	but then , south wind kept blowing one whole month
0	and here , on the edges of this island ,
0	and take the one he wishes for himself
0	the lovely lady talked of all she would been through in the house , looking at that destructive group , the suitors , who , because of her , had butchered
0	since there 's no future thanks for one 's good deeds
0	for both of us
0	many fine possessions stored away at home
0	to hurt him , in their eagerness to kill him
0	he would have killed the man
0	the housekeeper , quickly and in secret
0	to tell her dear father and her mother
0	they ran away in all directions
0	how i wish that he , too , might be struck
0	then he spoke to him—his words had wings :
0	but what about your battle with those trojansyou put to flight ?
0	falling thick and fast
0	but all the suitors cried out in the hall
0	you will enrage those gods and make them bitter
0	once he would said this , he put his lovely armour on , around his shoulders , and roused telemachus ,
0	taking the shining whip which fit his grip , automedon jumped in the chariot
0	this is the phenomenon of the lyric poet : as an apollonian genius he interprets the music through the image of the will , while he himself , fully released from the greed of his will , is a pure , untroubled eye of the sun
0	his dear nurse , eurycleia , then said to him :
0	across the island , far from my comrades ,
0	away from his companions , grasped his hand , and spoke :
0	where nymph calypso lives
0	on that floor , young men and women whose bride price would require many cattle were dancing , holding onto one another by the wrists
0	friends , now i will give the word—let 's hurl our spears
0	you two ajaxes , leaders of the argives armed in bronze , for you i have no orders
0	in different ways to see if , while its lord was gone ,
0	antilochus feared he might hurt himself or slit his throat with his own sword
0	you have that right
0	i may not be the best in battle
0	when resourceful lord odysseus noticed that ,
0	you should go inside the well-built home
0	for which my heart had gone through so much pain , suffering men 's wars and dangers on the sea ,
0	but nonetheless let her go back with the ships
0	achilles slept in a corner of his well-built hut , with lovely briseis stretched out there beside him
0	from such innerly degenerate music those with a true musical nature turned away with the same aversion which they had displayed before the art-killing tendency of socrates
0	or tremble at the vengeance of the gods
0	there 's going to be more war , more wretched combat ,
0	with them came terror , fear , and tireless strife , sister and companion of man-destroying ares— at first small in stature , she later grows enormous , head reaching heaven , as she strides across the earth
0	my own heart prompted me to do it
0	thoas moved in to close quarters , pulled the heavy spear out from his chest , drew his sharp sword , then drove it straight into the middle of his belly , destroying peirous ' life
0	to set me free , sent them clear signals
0	my dear child , which of the heavenly gods has treated youso nastily , as if you were committing some evil act in public ?
0	all your wealth or eat it up
0	that 's how true it is there 's nothing sweeter
0	for i am a man who suffers more
0	with immortal sea nymphs from the sea
0	to comb out wool and bear their slavery
0	ajax armed himself in glittering bronze
0	their numbers—from dulichium there are
0	by apollo 's silver bow in his own home
0	her sisters went with her in tears
0	stain you with lots of blood , and shove you out , send you packing from this house
0	he will suffer hardships , but in twenty days
0	how could he endure to perceive the echo of innumerable shouts of pleasure and woe in the wide space of the world night , enclosed in the wretched glass capsule of the human individual , without inexorably fleeing toward his primordial home , as he hears this shepherd 's dance of metaphysics ?
0	and once he would finished dinner , eurycleia
0	hermes the helper , going at once into her upper room in secret , had sex with her
0	i will lead the way
0	now , as it were , the olympic magic mountain reveals itself to us and shows us its roots
0	as he crossed the threshold , penelope addressed him :
0	to carry out revenge for agamemnon
0	and sandals for his feet
0	they dismounted and were welcomed joyfully
0	in a way no one would ever do ,
0	then on his own he set across his shoulders
0	then she called out to him and said :
0	on each side of the crowd they armed themselves , then both strode to the middle , prepared to fight , both glaring fearfully
0	where sun changes his course
0	told achaeans to plan on going home
0	about acting bravely with these suitors ?
0	i would make him ageless and immortal
0	he clutched a long-shadowed spear
0	pyraechmes led archers from paeonia , from far off amydon , by the axius , a broad flowing river , whose moving watersare the loveliest on earth
0	odysseus knew her from her voice , as she talked
0	stranger , you do not seem to be a wicked man ,
0	as he held his loyal and loving wife ,
0	but you can keep
0	high-thundering zeus , whose power is supreme
0	a married man but with no sons , was killed
0	idomeneus , seeing him clearly , dodged the spear , covering himself with the round shield he carried , one made of bull 's hide and shining bronze in rings , with two cross braces fitted on
0	it seems to me it 's zeus ' fault
0	they brought me here ,
0	but if my hands subdue you and you die , you will pose no problems for the argives later
0	men answered on the run
0	by dark waves stirred up by the west wind 's breath
0	but she did not reveal herself to him directly—
0	and inside the hall , with each man 's limbs
0	and thus whose udders were about to burst ,
0	with our own hands to roll from the high door
0	and his splendid son
0	he raised youas an infant in his home
0	charging through the gate and shouting at his dogs , he scattered them in a hail of stones here and there
0	i wo not miss my chance
0	they had trouble convincing him to go there— his heart was still so angry for his comrade
0	this process stands right at the beginning of the development of drama
0	she took with her that weighty , powerful spear—
0	so now , since i will not be returning home again , let me give this lock to warrior patroclusto carry with him
0	the sound of their lamenting filled the house
0	thus , among the assembled ships , mother and son spoke to each other many winged words
0	all at once , while he alone escaped from fate ,
0	or get the heart inside my chest stirred up
0	is some poor wanderer who 's just come here
0	we see that this book was burdened with an entire bundle of difficult questions
0	how could you dare come to achaea 's ships , and come alone , to rest your eyes on me , when i have killed so many noble sons of yours ?
0	her mother shared the same fate as that bird , the mournful halcyon , for she criedwhen apollo , the far shooter , seized her
0	by father zeus , athena , and apollo ,
0	the closely fitted doorway to this hall
0	i will not forget him , as long as i remain among the living , as long as my dear limbs have motion
0	sharp pain shot through his flesh
0	crowds of them came thronging in from all sides of the pit ,
0	of helen , something made by her own hands
0	and now , aelous , because he ’ s a friend of his ,
0	then poseidon moved on to the achaean camp
0	but come now , tell me—and speak truthfully—
0	they must all stand firm around the body , fighting hand to hand
0	were stored inside the hollow quiver
0	it did not miss , not even a single top on all the axe heads
0	that platonic distinction between and evaluation of the idea in contrast to the idol in connection with likenesses lies deeply grounded in the nature of the greeks
0	he came out , looking like ares
0	the god who slaughtered argus , mighty hermes , fell in love when he noticed her among the singing maidens in the chorus dancing for artemis , the golden-arrowed goddess in the echoing hunt
0	yet all this comes from you , the way you showfavours to these insolent men , these trojans , whose aggressive spirit has no limit , who can never get enough of battle , though they are not winning in an equal fight
0	once they would got there
0	as passenger , men who let you disembark
0	when you need him here so much !
0	i can tell you that my name is mentes ,
0	if heroes like goethe and schiller could not succeed in breaking open the enchanted gate which leads into the hellenic magic mountain ; if with their most dauntless striving they could not go beyond the longing gaze which goethe 's iphigenia casts from barbaric tauris to her home across the ocean , what could the epigones of such heroes hope for -- unless , amid the mystic tones of reawakened tragic music , the gate should open for them suddenly of its own accord , from an entirely different side , quite overlooked in all previous cultural endeavors
0	perhaps can tell me of his mournful death—
0	bad dreams as well
0	once he would killed his father ,
0	accordingly , we see that opinions concerning the value if the greeks for education have been degenerating in the most alarming manner since that time
0	do not let death weigh down your heart
0	who do not put salt on any food they eat ,
0	when every one of them had taken food and drink to his own heart 's content , nestor , the geranian horseman , began to speak :
0	they went there and , without any effort ,
0	i am here to learn the name of that wounded manyou drove in with
0	i manned nine ships
0	the suitors moved inside , laughing uproariously , and threw him words of greeting as they went
0	let there appear another sign from zeus
0	which had been damaged in some storms
0	for us , it is enough to have perceived that the essential charm , and therefore the genesis , of this new art form lies in the gratification of an altogether nonaesthetic need , in the optimistic glorification of man as such , in the conception of the primitive man as the man naturally good and artistic -- a principle of the opera that has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible demand which , in face of contemporary socialist movements , we can no longer ignore
0	and all the food he will eat , so he wo not ruin
0	aeneas strode out first , making threatening taunts , his heavy helmet nodding as he moved around
0	mingle with the suitors
0	until that time , no drink or food will pass my throat , at least , while my dead comrade lies inside my hut , mutilated by sharp bronze , with his feetstill pointing at the door , while his companionsmourn there around him
0	we all lay the blame for this on you
0	if a man honours these daughters of zeus as they come near , they will help him greatly , paying attention to him as he prays
0	thus these men kept toiling in the battle frenzy
0	every man then sacrificed to the immortal gods , praying to escape death and war 's killing zone
0	for men on earth about faithful penelope
0	but now you are last of all
0	i do not want to hit you with a sneaky shot , not a man like you , but in open combat , if i can manage it
0	you let approach the blood will speak to you and tell the truth , but those you keep away will once again withdraw
0	he also rules over the beautiful appearance of the inner fantasy world
0	and muses , nine in all , sang out a dirge ,
0	once the destroying fate of a harsh doom
0	when i would said this , she made the oath at once ,
0	the locrians were led by swift ajax , son of oileus , the lesser ajax , not the greater ajax , son of telamon , but a much smaller man
0	i reviewed these things in every detail ,
0	for i do not think you made it here on foot
0	if some man going past along the road upsets them by accident , they all swarm out with fearless hearts to guard their young—with that same heart and spirit the myrmidons then poured out from their ships with a ceaseless roar
0	skillful teucer then replied to agamemnon :
0	then alcinous responded to odysseus :
0	but now that the socratic culture can only hold the scepter of its infallibility with trembling hands ; now that it has been shaken from two directions -- once by the fear of its own consequences which it at length begins to surmise , and again because it no longer has its naïve confidence in the eternal validity of its foundation -- it is a sad spectacle to see how the dance of its thought rushes longingly toward ever-new forms , to embrace them , and then , shuddering , lets them go suddenly as mephistopheles does the seductive lamiae [ faust , lines ff ]
0	when he would drunk some blood , he wept aloud ,
0	where did you and your god-like companions
0	the dionysian musical enchantment of the sleeper now flashes around him , as it were , fiery images , lyrical poems , which are called , in their highest form , tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs
0	that resourceful man , replied to her and said :
0	they were dragging him off , as he roared aloud
0	young men , now you have entertained your hearts with tests of skill , so come inside the house ,
0	on this question classical antiquity itself gives us illustrative evidence when it places homer and archilochus next to each other as the originators and torch-bearers of greek poetry in paintings , cameos , and so on , with the assured feeling that only these two are to be considered equally the original natures from whom a fire-storm flowed out over the entire later world of the greeks
0	but telemachus moved in too quickly for him—
0	make sure your ship stays close to scylla 's rock
0	his skull , every bone at once
0	for the heavenly gods have given me
0	a pair of tripods and two silver bathing tubs ,
0	a word of omen , and here outside the house
0	with his long spear , and telemachus injured
0	tydeus ' son came across the king , the thirteenth man whose sweet life he had taken
0	this fine potion , which i will provide you , wo not allow it
0	me and my crew when scylla moves to strike
0	my child , what kind of speech has slipped the barrier of your teeth , when you declared
0	white-armed goddess hera agreed with what zeus said
0	they dragged him inside by the hair , threw him on the ground—the man was terrified—
0	steadfast thrasymedes stood holding a sharp axe
0	pallas athena had robbed them of their wits
0	but the happiest heart ,
0	he laced up lovely sandals over his sleek feet
0	with chairs and logs set all around
0	priam gazed in wonder at agamemnon , saying :
0	phylo brought a silver basket ,
0	he came to see me
0	meets them , they do not hide their true identity , because we are close relatives of theirs ,
0	the others reached the huts of atreus ' son
0	around her stood her husband 's sisters and his brother 's wives
0	leonteus then struck down in quick succession menon , iamenus , and orestes— all these lay prone there , on the all-nourishing earth
0	trojans had dragged the horse all by themselves
0	now , if we add the most important phenomenon of the entire ancient lyric , the union , universally acknowledged as natural , between the lyricist and the musician , even their common identity ( in comparison with which our recent lyrics look like the image of a god without a head ) then we can now , on the basis of the aesthetic metaphysics we established earlier , account for the lyric poet in the following manner
0	then once more over patroclus the bitter fight resumed—fierce and full of sorrow
0	but a single man kept on yelling out abuse— scurrilous thersites , expert in various insults , vulgar terms for inappropriate attacks on kings , whatever he thought would make the argives laugh
0	he 's begging me to go back home again ,
0	once i nod my assent , nothing i saycan be revoked , denied , or unfulfilled
0	no man could criticize a house like this
0	sarpedon , leader of lycian spearmen , lies dead , the man who protected lycia with his judgment and his power—slaughteredby ares on the bronze spear of patroclus
0	i am frustrated for myself
0	in two different groups , one where hyperion goes down , the other where he rises
0	in order to grasp this point , we must demolish that artistic structure of apollonian culture , as it were , stone by stone , until we see the foundations on which it is built
0	so even in death , your name did not die
0	shrewd telemachus then answered her and said :
0	and raise them well
0	set the child upon his knees and spoke to him :
0	she would packed it with cloaks and tunics , and woollen blankets , too—protection from the wind
0	went through the hall until he came to arete
0	nestor 's son peisistratus approached them first , took athena and telemachus both by the hand ,
0	for he had made the challenge , made it eagerly
0	night is passing quickly
0	showed everyone the truth
0	by setting out this historical example , we have attempted to clarify how tragedy surely dies away with the disappearance of the spirit of music , since tragedy can arise only out of this spirit
0	then the women went out from the hall , the ones
0	ajax dodged the weapon , but only just
0	many men live there , more than one can count ,
0	she set in place for her
0	he kept on trying to wrap some trojan soldier in death 's dark night or to fall himself , defending achaeans from disaster
0	while i was alive , you never did neglect me
0	then , with his bronze , he butchered those twelve noble sons of the courageous trojans , his feelings grimly set on this atrocity
0	surpasses that of every other human group ,
0	the hero became a gladiator , to whom people gave his freedom , after he had been well beaten and was covered with wounds
0	to bring them to a nasty death , then left
0	he began dragging paris off , back in the direction of well-armed achaeans
0	my words soon won them over
0	turning in all directions ,
0	my heart by then had changed—it now desired
0	down on the ground away from him , leaning it
0	hector , you other leaders , you allies , it 's foolish to think of driving our swift horses
0	and might make fun of him , which would bring me
0	godlike achaeans now could pause for some relief from the destructive killing of impartial war
0	now , since you keep me here , telling me to wait for your young master ,
0	for the sake of your offerings and the god
0	come , put that sword back in its sheath , and let the two of us
0	from somewhere else , that 's how odysseus spread the leaves to cover him
0	i will send some clothing here
0	fill the house all day
0	deucalion had me and king idomeneus
0	he let go of the spear and crouched there , both his hands stretched out
0	achilles slept in a corner of the well-built hut
0	through the doorway until he reached the courtyard and the portico gate
0	you should turn your passion into kindness , the hospitality of your own house
0	what gives your heart delight
0	when my royal mother has to leave here
0	when achaeans sailed back to their dear native land , then poseidon and apollo planned to erase that wall , by stirring up the raging power of all rivers flowing from mount ida to the sea—rhesus , heptaporus , caresus , rhodius , granicus , aesepus , the sacred scamander and simoeis , where many ox-hide shields and helmets had fallen in the dust , along with a race of people half-divine
0	by apollo , whom zeus loves , to whom you , calchas , pray in prophesy to the danaans , i swear this—while i live to look upon the light of day , no achaean will raise violent hands against you , no , not even if you name agamemnon , who claims he 's by far the best achaean
0	or are they kind to strangers ?
0	do not let these things afflict your heart
0	they placed it on the fire , poured water in it , and added wood below
0	for you maintain it 's not appropriate that someone else speak out against you , either in a council meeting or in war , for he should always back your leadership
0	meet the shade of teiresias of thebes ,
0	antinous was the only one to speak
0	but come , we will make you the same proposition—and we will deliver
0	resourceful odysseus then answered her and said :
0	that ’ s the reason earthshaker poseidon
0	where are you from ?
0	to boast above the bodies of the slain
0	beside priam , hector 's mother wept
0	against us , and they will send out messengers
0	for none could match his speed on foot , as he ran , chasing men in flight when zeus forced them to flee
0	the song which they have heard most recently
0	and when were we in greater need of these highest of all teachers than at present , when we are experiencing a rebirth of tragedy and are in danger alike of not knowing whence it comes and of being unable to make clear to ourselves whither it tends ?
0	between the mixing bowl and silver-studded chair , rushed out in person to clasp odysseus ' knees ,
0	on the seas at random , like those pirates
0	godlike theoclymenus then said in reply :
0	going back to our swift ship beside the sea
0	speaking the truth so i can understand—
0	in there lives scylla
0	so stop all this ,
0	at that point it was hard to recognize each dead man
0	in the rear , meriones roused the ranks for action
0	there boeotians fought , ionians in long tunics , locrians , phthians , and glittering epeians
0	unlike the old man afflicted with excessive suffering , a man who merely suffers as the victim of everything which happens to him , now we have the unearthly serenity which descends from the sphere of the gods and indicates to us that the hero in his purely passive conduct achieves his highest action , which reaches out far over his own life ( whereas his conscious striving in his earlier life led him to pure passivity )
0	i am afraid everything the goddess said
0	and eurypylus then slaughtered melanthus
0	but even if wide-ruling agamemnon , heroic son of atreus , is to blame , if he really is the reason for all this ,
0	but i worried about the horses—they would lack foragewith so many men all crammed together , and they were used to eating very well
0	i start to sweat
0	hippothous let go the feet of brave patroclus , allowing them to fall and lie there
0	but tell hippodameia and autonoe
0	it 's the brightest of the stars , but an unwelcome sign , for it brings wretched mortals many fevers
0	or will you change your mind ?
0	acorns , beech nuts , cornel fruit , the stuff
0	matches his ability to string this bow
0	did he take citizens of ithaca ,
0	but he should have prayed to the immortals—in the race he would not have finished last
0	taking no food—she would not eat or drink—
0	here , the lofty and highly much praised artistic achievement of attic tragedy and the dramatic dithyramb presents itself before our eyes , as the common goal of both artistic drives , whose secret marriage partnership , after a long antecedent struggle , celebrated itself with such a child , simultaneously antigone and cassandra
0	no one dared sit down , all terrified because achilles had appeared , after his long absence from that savage conflict
0	far from the sea , such a gentle passing ,
0	in the same way ,
0	one can guess from all this just where the great question mark about the worth of existence was placed
0	is a physician whose knowledge of these things
0	even though he is not here ,
0	she quickly took the looped thong from its hook , put in the key , and with a push shoved back the bolt
0	his heart was happy
0	knows nothing of all this , and neither do
0	dear brother , my father , my noble mother , and my comrades begged me repeatedly to stay there
0	the shades of suitors whom odysseus had killed
0	since he sat beside him and heard his heavy sighs
0	once he sent me here to bring away
0	and then he would have burned those well-balanced ships with searing fire on the spot , if queen herahad not set a plan in agamemnon 's mind to rouse achaeans with all speed on his own
0	its people have confidence in that
0	with your own head
0	to the borders of the field where the swineherd
0	but why do not we discusshow this warfare is going to finish up—whether we should re-ignite harsh combat , this horrific strife , or make both sides friends
0	from those suitors and their murderous pride
0	with a high box framed on top
0	now they are dead—and the man who killed them
0	is some mortal human driving off your flocks or killing you by treachery or force ?
0	looking like telemachus , she went all through the city
0	and now the vultures
0	i do not think he will give up
0	they spun out that destructive thread for men ,
0	i answered him and said :
0	you would not have seen a single argive there
0	then all those present reached for the splendid dinner set in front of them
0	many of us living on olympus have been hurt by men in our attempts to bring harsh troubles on each other
0	they furled the sail and quickly lowered the mast
0	medon was a bastard son of noble oïleus , thus brother to ajax , but lived in phylace , far from his native land
0	you understand my words -- as you will also , in conclusion , understand my hopes
0	and menelaus , who loved war , shuddered , too
0	i called a meeting and spoke to all the men :
0	two loyal companions , mecistus , son of echius , and alastor , bent down , then carried hypsenor groaning to the hollow ships
0	if a goddess had not felt pity for me
0	on my broad shoulders , he told me to set it
0	when argives saw hector carried back , they charged in , going at trojans even more , their battle fury roused
0	priam 's son hit menelaus with his arrow— on the front plate of his armour , in the chest
0	that would be better
0	that a man who would won much property
0	he even boasts about it—since achilles stays beside his hollow ships , anger in his heart
0	they thwart my wishto smash down those sturdy walls of troy
0	who , in the home of godlike odysseus ,
0	in winter , winds blow them down to earth , but then , when spring season comes again , the budding wood grows more
0	if some other man , some earthly mortal , had told me this , a prophet who interprets sacrificesor some priest , we would think it false , reject it
0	a lovely object , beautifully made ,
0	thinking of their common cause , he spoke out :
0	the dionysian greek wants truth and nature in their highest power : he seems himself transformed into a satyr
0	once we have killed these men , father and son , then you will be slaughtered , too , for all the things you are keen to bring out
0	to fetch the body of the dead elpenor
0	let him stay alive a while and suffer
0	but now , with his master gone , he lay neglected
0	all right , stranger , i will be truthful with you
0	odysseus led onthe cephallenians , soldiers from ithaca , well wooded neritum , crocylea , rugged aegilips , from zacynthus , samos , both those inhabiting the mainlandand those from cities on the facing shore
0	and will be here soon
0	let us but observe these patrons of music at close range , as they really are , indefatigably crying : beauty !
0	but then i was taken
0	so she could tell him everything , while his wife , his townsfolk , and his friends would not know who he was , until the suitors ' crimes had all been paid in full
0	and you can visit him—eurymachus ,
0	ever burned a sacrifice to you—
0	as he poured libations in his house ,
0	i spoke these reassuring words to him :
0	do not you want them to win ?
0	to lie down under blankets on a bed
0	gazing down from ida , the son of cronos made the fight an equal combat , so on both sides men killed each other
0	then antinous , eupeithes ' son , spoke out to them :
0	the two warriors then seized a chariot with two men , their people 's finest , two sons of merops from percote , a man skilled ,
0	she did not bring you with her servants
0	and also , should the need arise , on foot
0	you always love to work on things in secret , without involving me
0	athena then approached and fleshed out the limbs on that shepherd of his people
0	he did not dare protect his slaughtered brother 's corpse
0	he would been a wealthy man ,
0	should we not eradicate it forcefully from greek soil ?
0	getting in beside her , iris picked up the reins , then lashed the horses forward
0	and string it with the greatest ease , then shoot an arrow through twelve axes , all of them ,
0	will give me retribution
0	mighty polyphemus , as he stroked its back ,
0	waves were holding up
0	there are many of you and few of them
0	on anyone here who has not honoured
0	then from the deck picked up his powerful spear
0	but once he would seen odysseus after nineteen years , the dark finality of death at once seized argus
0	they pushed ahead , for there were two of them , both really keen to win , because they would set the greatest prize for that particular race
0	from under the yoke , his swift-footed horse called xanthus spoke to him , ducking his head down quickly , so all his mane streamed down from underneath his shoulder harness beside the yoke towards the ground
0	mentor , you mischief maker , your wits
0	drive forward , you horse-taming trojans
0	when archilochus , the first greek lyric poet , announces his raging love and , at the same time , his contempt for the daughters of lycambes , it is not his own passion which dances in front of us in an orgiastic frenzy
0	resourceful odysseus then answered her and said :
0	so he will give you a splendid ransom , if he learns i am by achaean ships , alive
0	to the female slave you esteem the most ,
0	to kill him , rip out his heart , and devour
0	had left my limbs
0	do not hold back from bringing to fulfillment
0	has stirred the spirit in my chest
0	the poet tells us this , a poet who fought throughout his long life against dionysus with heroic force , only to conclude his life finally with a glorification of his opponent and a suicide , like a man suffering from vertigo who , in order to escape the dreadful dizziness , which he can no longer endure , throws himself off a tower
0	they are restless , just sitting idly there
0	and shambling bent-horned cattle
0	helen carried off this robe , and they returned ,
0	make sure there are twenty measures of ground-up barley meal
0	when east wind and south wind rush down together from father zeus ' clouds to whip up the sea , the whole assembly rippled , like a large grain field , undulating under the fury of the storm , as west wind roars in with force , all ears of corn ducking down under the power of the gusts— that ’ s how the shouting men stampeded to their ships
0	will you never stop asking your questions
0	do they really bear the stamp of nature 's darling children who are fostered and nourished at the breast of the beautiful , or are they not rather seeking a mendacious cloak for their own coarseness , an aesthetical pretext for their insensitive sobriety ; here i am thinking of otto jahn , for example [ professor of classical philology at bonn ]
0	come here , friend , stand by me
0	apollo of the silver bow then made an image , a copy of aeneas , with matching armour , around which trojans and brave achaeans fought , hacking away at ox-hide covering their chests , at the round shields or smaller shields with fringes
0	to demonstrate that socrates also merits such a place among the drivers of the chariot , it is sufficient to recognize him as typifying a form of existence inconceivable before him , the type known as theoretical man
0	apollo slipped into the throng of fighting men
0	though he 's far off , cover him with glory now
0	hurry up and kill the finest pig there is ,
0	send favouring winds blowing stiffly through the air , so the ship could complete its voyage quickly
0	let a man go and get that sweet-toned lyre
0	she came out , opened up her shining doors without delay , and asked them in
0	immortal gods who dwell on mount olympus no longer disagree about all this
0	his hair was dirtied with the dust
0	and so they slept there in the palace vestibule , prince telemachus and nestor 's noble son
0	the most expensive one
0	go to the army
0	so bring two lambs here—white male , black female—for earth and sun
0	just as a carpenter 's line makes ship 's timber straight , when a craftsman 's hand applies it , a skilled expert in all facets of his craft , inspired by athena— that 's how tensely poised the fighting in that battle stood
0	with your skill in horsemanship forgotten
0	at such auspicious words
0	agamemnon , king of men , answered menelaus :
0	of other men before we got back here ,
0	then bright-eyed athena told telemachus
0	from the standpoint of epic this uneven and irregular word of images in the lyric is easy to condemn—something no doubt the solemn rhapsodists of the apollonian celebrations did in the age of terpander
0	patroclus drew back a little , evading the anger of apollo , the far shooter
0	be kind and give me some of that again
0	many relatives of his
0	dark-haired earthshaker , is that the messagei am to take from you to zeus , these harsh , defiant words ?
0	exactly where his midriff held his liver ,
0	but a home belonging to odysseus ,
0	so all day long until the sun went down ,
0	for a long time now , this must have been what zeus desired , and zeus ' son , the god who shoots from far , and all those who willingly gave me helpin earlier days
0	when death comes from the gods
0	that 's what he said
0	there he hammered out the earth , the heavens , the sea , the untiring sun , the moon at the full , along with every constellation which crowns the heavens— the pleiades , the hyades , mighty orion , and the bear , which some people call the wain ,
0	does he bring news your father 's coming ,
0	of every human being
0	he will get back home and take out his revenge
0	turning round , socus began to run
0	they gave me to a stranger they had met ,
0	she has thought up another stratagem :
0	the armour on his leg , newly hammered tin , gave out a fearful clang
0	but i always expected he would be large , a noble man , with enormous power
0	your libation and have prayed , as is right ,
0	in someone else 's house and do not dare
0	be my guide with the gods ' help , until i reach the hut of peleus ' son
0	her heart encouraged that so clear a dream
0	you do not join us , so we destroy these arrogant trojansonce and for all , along with all their childrenand their honourable wives as well
0	yes , my friends , believe with me in dionysian life and the rebirth of tragedy
0	as he spoke , he threw his tattered bag full of holes across his shoulders , hanging by a twisted strap
0	but when they ran past those springs the fourth time , father zeus raised his golden scales , setting there two fatal lots for death 's long sorrow , one for achilles , one for horse-taming hector
0	as diomedes finished , dolon was intending to cup his chin with his strong hand in supplication
0	while i was still a child , you suitors
0	once they were no longer pulling hard
0	fatherzeus , why is no god standing by me here , in this pitiful state , rescuing mefrom this river ?
0	which will separate me from odysseus ' house ,
0	in distress and late , in someone else 's ship , after losing every one of your companions
0	paris then killed menesthius , king areithous ’ son
0	and twisted it inside the socket of his eye
0	a pouch of food , as well
0	then the old man ordered his servant woman to pour pure water on his hands
0	you dear lads , fight no more
0	wo not shame your family
0	pandion also went , carrying teucer 's curving bow
0	so then , all day long until the sunset ,
0	for in this place the earth will cover me
0	she climbed up in the chariot , her fond heart suffering
0	and the life you lead is good
0	the men were terrified
0	and that 's why it is understandable that music is capable of bringing out every painting , even every scene of real life and the world , with an immediate and higher significance and , of course , to do that all the more , the closer the analogy of its melody to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon
0	she cried out , calling him—her words had wings :
0	i would have visited another mighty king
0	he 's near by and safe
0	the journalist , the paper slave of the day , triumphs over the professor in all matters pertaining to culture ; and nothing remains to the latter but the metamorphosis , often experienced by now , of fluttering also like a cheerful cultured butterfly , with the light elegance peculiar to this sphere , employing the journalist 's style
0	there are more of them , and they are braver men ,
0	but when they reached the ford across the swirling river xanthus , immortal zeus ' child , hermes left them and returned to high olympus
0	he strode off to face idomeneus , fiercely eager for this fight
0	setting her hand on the chariot yoke , the goddess said :
0	but as the days and months kept passing by
0	or if he does not know me any more ,
0	dear nurse , do not laugh at them and boast too much
0	it seems to me
0	huge waves with a dreadful roar smashing on dry land and foaming spray concealing everything—
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	i do not think he will grow up to adulthood
0	we must get back
0	the women added their laments
0	all-conquering sleep could not overcome him , as he tossed and turned , longing for manly , courageous , strong patroclus , thinking of all he would done with him , all the pain they would suffered , as they would gone through wars with other men and with the perilous sea
0	as he said this , warrior idomeneus dragged him by the feet through lines of fighting men
0	telemachus spoke to them with strength and power :
0	you do not want to suffer shame from aethe , who 's just a mare
0	for i clearly said odysseus should suffer much misfortune
0	here it becomes necessary to take a bold running start and leap into a metaphysics of art , by repeating the sentence written above [ section ] , that existence and thee world seem justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon
0	although athena hated him , he would have been saved , if he would not grown insanely foolish—
0	the men climbed in , went to their rowing seats ,
0	was that what made aegisthus brave enough
0	give me your hand , i beg you , for i will never come again from hades , once you have given me what 's due , my funeral fire
0	they quickly set him down in spacious lycia , his own rich land
0	on the other side , when patroclus saw him , he leapt from his chariot
0	minos then fathered worthy deucalion
0	next i saw minos , glorious son of zeus ,
0	the first to speak was white-armed arete , who said :
0	the spear hit ajax , right where two straps intersected on his chest , one for his shield , one for his silver-studded sword
0	then the shade of swift achilles
0	i have just heard myself to pass along to you ,
0	his well-sprung bow was there , and quivers , too , with lots of painful arrows ,
0	like a diver , off the ship
0	what you have just said is quite irrelevant
0	we can arrange the marriage contractby our seaworthy ships
0	but nestor , wanting them to stay , appealed to them and said :
0	he said he would slice off both our ears with bronze
0	my father 's calling for you
0	inside the spacious cave , every sheep and goat
0	and rolling in distress , i answered her :
0	the fruitful vineyard and from there continued down to the extensive orchard , where he failed to find
0	we sailed in there , dragged our ship on land , and walked along the stream of oceanus ,
0	i see this idea stamped out in that dreadful trinity of oedipus 's three fates : the same man who solved the riddle of nature ( the ambiguous sphinx ) must also break the most sacred natural laws when he murders his father and marries his mother
0	they answered him—their words had wings :
0	no more words from you abusing our kings , seeking to sneak back home
0	once athena had said this , achilles obeyed , rejoicing in his heart , as he stood there , leaning on his bronze-tipped ash spear
0	once he would said this , antinous turned on eumaeus , to reprimand him :
0	but eumaeus had no wish
0	all the gods you will offer perfect sacrifices ,
0	let 's move first—capture him out in the fields ,
0	what a cheerful confidence there is about these daring endeavors , in the very heart of theoretical culture ! -- solely to be explained by the comforting belief , that man-in-himself is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera , the eternally piping or singing shepherd , who must always in the end rediscover himself as such , should he ever at any time really lost himself ; to be considered solely as the fruit of that optimism , which here rises like a sweetishly seductive column of vapor from the depth of the socratic world view
0	then she called the famous artisan hephaestus :
0	that morning is already drawing near
0	the gods conducted me to ogygia ,
0	he spoke to his courageous heart :
0	when someone else runs into you and says
0	he can say i because he is the moving central point of that world
0	the helmet round his temples gave a dreadful clang , as he went down
0	patroclus then obeyed his dear companion
0	glaucus , leader of the lycian spearmen , was the firstto turn around
0	he had theoclymenus sit by him in the stern
0	to a follower of yours , and now you sit
0	obviously the degree of clarity in these men 's knowledge was the factor that designated them collectively as the three wise men of their time
0	when i looked around the hall , i saw the geese—
0	who has received from god the gift of song
0	just now i stated we would go back to troy today , once we would destroyed the ships and slaughteredall achaeans
0	and led me on my way
0	the enraptured horde of those who served dionysus rejoiced under the influence of such moods and insights , whose power transformed them before their very eyes , so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses , as satyrs
0	which of the gods incited these two men to fight ?
0	and make me his wife ?
0	and help my dear son grow into a man
0	the ones who disrespect me and the ones
0	have endured great suffering a long time over such a woman—just like a goddess , immortal , awe-inspiring
0	in this man 's form , apollo , son of zeus , spoke up :
0	a well-known reputation going there
0	down to the edges of the island , where tall trees grew , alder , poplar , and pine that reached the upper sky , well-seasoned , dried-out wood , which could keep him afloat
0	my friend , everything you say is true enough
0	save the son of clytius , just in caseachaeans strip his armour now he 's fallenamong this group of ships
0	take the one you want , the best of those in view
0	areilycus fell face down in the dirt
0	whoever you may be among the gods ,
0	both hosts and guest , can enjoy our feasting
0	ajax , worthy son of telamon , ca not you forget ,
0	and underneath the dark and sandy ground
0	obeying athena 's words , achilles relaxed his huge fist on the silver hiltand pushed the massive sword back in its scabbard
0	their bronze spear points glittered like father zeus ' lightning
0	if you are the two sons of antimachus , that hot-hearted man who , when menelaus cameas envoy once to the assembled trojanswith godlike odysseus , urged the trojans to kill menelaus , to stop him going backto the achaeans , now you will pay the pricefor those shameful actions of your father
0	six of my companions , right from the ship ,
0	the sightless prophet—circe 's words , as well ,
0	those weapons are no longer like the ones odysseus left
0	telemachus you boaster , your spirit
0	those which pass through the fresh-cut ivory
0	offer you delightful sacrifices
0	you have no spirit—you ’ re always brooding
0	trojans must not seize our ships and leave uswith no way to escape
0	and fifty-four feet high
0	when they reached the broad achaean army , they hauled the black ship high up on the sand , pushed long props tight beneath it , then dispersed , each man returning to his own huts and ships
0	so the mighty spear of warrior aeneas did not break the shield , stopped by the golden armour , a present from the god
0	holding up his sceptre , hector swore :
0	we have advice for you , if you will listen
0	the bronze spear point bit into his lungs
0	poseidon would get angry with us ,
0	about twice as far , i started shouting ,
0	whether he should do so openly or not
0	dressed him in sweet-smelling clothes , and sent him from the island
0	saying this , achilles reached out with his arms , but he grasped nothing
0	divinely raised antilochus , come here , so you can learn the painful news , somethingi wish had never happened
0	someone invested with enormous power ,
0	the instinct of aristophanes ( which grasped issues so surely ) was certainly right when he linked together socrates himself , the tragedies of euripides , and the music of the new writers of dithyrambs , hating each of them and smelling in all three of them the characteristics of a degenerate culture
0	my father , brave odysseus , over there ,
0	zeus ' harsh whip has lashed achaeans back , and your heart now wants to break our ships
0	could escape being killed
0	at troy who lost his chance to see the day he would come back
0	all your possessions for yourself as king
0	now , in that land , phorcys , the old man of the sea ,
0	trojans gave a shout
0	as for telemachus , you should use your skill
0	i have endured a lot in many wanderings ,
0	once they would come down to the sea and reached the ship , on shore they came across
0	leaving the others well behind , about as far
0	just as a man yokes oxen , big bulls , wide in the shoulder , to grind barley on a well-built threshing floor , and lowing oxen quickly flatten all the grain , that how brave achilles drove his sure-footed horses to trample on the dead and on their shields as well
0	come in the hut
0	or men who might have turned their island
0	and same , as well as those who lord it here
0	down the road or those who live close by—
0	he snatched agenor up , hid him in dense mist , then sent him quietly away from battle
0	for he looks like someone who offers prayers
0	the other man 's angry heart and spiritare checked , once he takes the compensation
0	be patient , for you must endure them all
0	and growing old , he would have given me
0	i have come back to sunny ithaca
0	they washed blood off with water and piled them onto carts , shedding hot tears
0	athena stood behind achilles , grabbed him by his golden hair , invisible to allexcept achilles
0	there lies great-hearted anchises ' son , aeneas , whom we honour as we do prince hector
0	a different route and chart another course , a scheme , i think , which gave zeus pleasure
0	at his own hearth
0	the deep swirling river had had sex with her
0	as soon as she appeared up on the rock
0	without being harmed , how his comrades slaughtered the oxen of the sun god helios , how his ship
0	it was a powerful victory of the non-dionysian spirit when , in the development of the new dithyramb , it alienated music from itself and pushed it down to be the slave of appearances
0	far from the city
0	their hearts did not lack a thing—they shared the meal as equals
0	in their swift ship and set me here in ithaca
0	the nightingale of the green woods , sings out
0	left to go up island
0	then she went away , leaving achilles there , angry at heart for lovely girdled briseis , taken from him by force against his will
0	by these ships the wall was lowest
0	arrogant men so recklessly have planned
0	or a haven from the sea
0	put clean clothing on your body , then go—
0	when telemachus and peisistratus reached
0	high on the wall they hacked each other 's armour— leather bucklers and large round shields across their chests , quivering targets
0	so , anger in my heart , i yelled again :
0	then he stripped the armour off the son of paeon , a famous spearman
0	what power was it which liberated prometheus from his vultures and transformed myth to a vehicle of dionysian wisdom ?
0	penelope laughed and quickly spoke these winged words to eumaeus :
0	armed sentinels went out , led by thrasymedes , nestor 's son , his people 's shepherd ,
0	that island has no flocks or plough land—
0	they killed plump swine , as well ,
0	come now , dear nurse , tell me the truth
0	anyone you met would call you blessed
0	is not morality a desire for the denial of life , a secret instinct for destruction , a principle of decay , diminution , and slander , a beginning of the end , and thus , the greatest of all dangers ?
0	then peisander struck , hitting glorious menelaus ' shield , but his bronze could not break through
0	glancing at the man who sat beside him ,
0	is not a good companion
0	from those he meets , for tonight at least
0	the gods display their love so openly
0	but i wo not comenear zeus , lull him to sleep , unless he bids me , asks in person
0	no sooner had he said all this , than amphinomus , turning in his place , saw a ship in the deep harbour
0	or were you killed by enemies on land ,
0	from every quarter , for cronos ' son
0	and on sweet wine
0	i hate like the gates of hell any man who says one thing while thinking something else which stays hidden in his mind
0	there he reached out with both hands for his companions
0	but why do not welie down and make joyful love together ?
0	from that i have had food and drink and helped out those who have a claim on my attention
0	i have come here now
0	son of atreus , why question me on this ?
0	her dear husband , until bright-eyed athena
0	went along as well
0	give me the truth , so i clearly understand—
0	come on then , go after them with speed , so we may capture nestor 's shield , whose fameextends right up to heaven—it 's all gold—the shield itself , cross braces , too
0	prudent telemachus then said in reply :
0	the heart in your chest
0	for a drink—the sun 's heat forced it down
0	that nobody destroyed my wits with wine
0	and there 's no point in prattling like the wind
0	planning desperate acts , wasting the wealth
0	that 's how the suitors talked
0	put into his chestsome nectar and beautiful ambrosia , so hunger wo not consume him
0	thus these two art drives must unfold their powers in a strict proportion , according to the law of eternal justice
0	she , a modest virgin , went upstairs , where the god lay with her in secret
0	some men stayed together in their seats , but others , more than half , jumped up with noisy shouts
0	he 's a bad beggar if he feels disgraced
0	for every trojan 's limbs were seized with trembling fear when they observed him there , swift son of peleus in that blazing armour , like man-killing ares
0	for the finest hearts can change
0	they joined their hands with his , and with their words they pledged their help
0	well , here i am in person—
0	take all the weapons of war lying there ,
0	great priam did not permit his trojans to lament
0	it is probable , however , that almost everyone , upon close examination , finds that the critical-historical spirit of our culture has so affected him that he can only make the former existence of myth credible to himself by means of scholarship , through intermediary abstractions
0	who will offer him some bread and cups of water
0	both forestays on the mast , which then fell back , and all our rigging crashed down in the hold
0	for soon the achaeans will attack you , all together , and cut you down
0	shrewd telemachus then said in reply :
0	myth alone saves all the powers of the imagination and of the apollinian dream from their aimless wanderings
0	then she could pour out on his eyelids and his crafty mind a deep warm sleep
0	then thetis , goddess with the silver feet , answered achilles :
0	up in the sky the sun has disappeared—
0	to be an athlete
0	glorious achilles , i am sure you have set your heart on destroying the city which proud trojans holdthis very day
0	but now especially be my friend , athena
0	and not a wedding feast
0	i agreed to give it to him
0	it 's what the old man swore , but you failedto bring about what he desired
0	gold statues of young men stood on sturdy pedestals , holding torches in their hands to give light at night for people feasting in the hall
0	that a single person should step forward at the beginning of a work and explain who he is , what has gone on before the action starts , what has happened up to this point , and even what will occur in the unfolding of the work , that would strike a modern poetical dramatist as a wanton , inexcusable abandonment of all the effects of suspense
0	you can beg for it throughout the country
0	i will prophesy what the immortals
0	whenever i get the urge to wipe outsome city whose inhabitants you love , do not try to thwart me
0	lord apollo , son of zeus , then answered hector :
0	in twenty cups of water , and the smell
0	now you must accept this splendid armour from hephaestus— no man has ever had such gorgeous armourto wear around his shoulders
0	shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
0	they obeyed at once
0	and speak to me as well
0	but let 's postpone discussion of all this
0	while there 's food and drink in our swift ship , let 's think of eating , so we do not waste away and die of hunger
0	antinous and eurymachus , both men
0	that 's how odysseus let tears of pity fall
0	no , scamander , the swirling river , will carry you awayto the broad lap of the sea
0	he bids you quickly arm long-haired achaeans , for now you can take troy , city of wide streets
0	beside the corded bedstead
0	i had to support myself
0	for telemachus , so we could capture
0	your death will come far from the sea , such a gentle passing ,
0	fishing with bent hooks , their stomachs cramped
0	then with both arms i paddled and swam off
0	laertes ' son , and carry them away
0	he 's not in his right mind , not in the least
0	wasting days and nights away with weeping
0	now he moved out to face atreus ' son agamemnon
0	her knees moved quickly as her feet hurried on
0	let him speak first
0	to pray to the gods , hoping one of them
0	and ask about them , you must deceive them
0	you have fallen in our hands
0	from sleep , approached them from odysseus ' house , and stood up in their midst
0	the child 's loving father laughed , his noble mother , too
0	beyond all other women on this earth ,
0	through its portrayal the lyrical genius sees right into the very basis of things
0	to make him hard for people to identify ,
0	your husband wo not get home—he 's in the house ,
0	the actor in this dramatic epic remains , in the most profound sense , still a rhapsodist ; the consecration of the inner dream lies upon all his actions , so that he is never completely an actor
0	could use it when they would bathed
0	then zeus put great power into pylians
0	but all of you must come here , even if not called by name , for you will feel shame and anger in your hearts ,
0	so did the dogs , as well
0	and noble honours given by the people
0	once he would organized the snare around the bed , he announced a trip to lemnos ,
0	next time i will beat him
0	trojans , lycians , you dardan spearmen , hold your place
0	so lord odysseus , who had endured so much , prayed there , while two strong mules took the girl into the city
0	map of the home states of some of the major achaean and trojan leaders
0	bearing in mind their common good , polydamas addressed them :
0	they live without a council or assembly
0	cydonians and three groups of dorians ,
0	tying it to the rock
0	then he will welcome him in an appropriate way
0	the ninth one was the mother of the batch
0	so listen , both of you
0	is always telling me to eat and drink ,
0	indeed , they must have felt even more that their entire existence , with all its beauty and moderation , rested on some hidden underground of suffering and knowledge which was reawakened through that very dionysian
0	a pair of clasps and a fine engraving
0	then cyclops once again picked up a rock ,
0	may recognize that we are about to fight
0	had washed the pebbles clean
0	or if , in his own presence , men armed with swords hacked down his brother or his son , as he looked on
0	diomedes then challenged two sons of priam , son of dardanus , both in a single chariot— echemmon and chromius
0	and no man born and no one yet to be
0	two stalwart followers of mighty zeus
0	we walked by these very trees
0	they did not run off
0	with a heavy groan , swift-footed achilles then answered thetis :
0	he knows nothing of our trouble , the great suffering which afflicts the army
0	more so than others
0	even for my own wife that 's dangerous
0	they collapsed in droves
0	dividing ithaca from rugged samos ,
0	let the call go outfrom heralds , whom zeus loves , through all the city , for growing boys and gray-haired men to campup on the city 's walls , built by the gods
0	all right my child , i will tell you the truth
0	do not you recall the time i strung you up on high , putting two anvils on your feet , tying your wrists with unbreakable gold rope ?
0	but hera , zeus ' honoured wife , was angry
0	if gods would only give me strength like that ,
0	at close range odysseus wounded damastor 's son
0	of someone else , and zeus awards them spoils
0	most powerful , mighty zeus , and you others , you immortal gods , may you make surethe men who first violate these oathswill have their brains spill out onto the ground , just like this wine , they and their children
0	amphigenea , pteleum , helos , dorium , where the muses met the thracian thamyris , and stopped his singing
0	there 's a fountain , with meadows all around
0	antilochus , you may still be quite young , but zeus and poseidon have been fond of you
0	he wound the veil across his chest , and then , with arms outstretched , fell face first in the sea ,
0	i , too , had my own ram , the finest one
0	when they would approached each other , at close quarters , great hector of the shining helmet spoke out first :
0	for lord achilles killed my father , when he wiped out thebe , city with high gates , slaying eëtion
0	the trojans roared out in response
0	do you think he will take me to his home
0	with these words , poseidon left , once he would explainedthese matters to aeneas
0	he was foaming at the mouth , below his eyebrows the eyes were raging fire—the helmet round his temples shook with menace , as hector battled on , for zeus , the god of heaven , was his protector , giving him glory and honour , though he was but one man among so many , for hector 's life would soon cease
0	then hector threw his bright spear at automedon , but since he was directly facing hector , he saw the bronze spear coming and evaded it by leaning forward
0	achilles , friend of zeus , you ask me to explainapollo 's anger , the god who shoots from far
0	it would not be appropriate for meto say no to your demand , since you sleepin the arms of zeus , the greatest of the gods
0	then he spied us and said :
0	i will tell you something else—
0	the rest kept fighting , with no let up in the noise
0	when they themselves are cowards—just as if a doe has put two new-born suckling fawns
0	shrewd telemachus then said in reply :
0	once he would said this , with his sharp bronze axe he chopped up wood for kindling , while others led in a big fat boar , five years old , and stood him by the hearth
0	hector with his glittering helmet then yelled out :
0	friends , i will tell you this ,
0	at the point where argives , having burned their huts and gone on board their well-oared ships , were sailing off ,
0	and never fail , while the sea yields up its fish
0	with his spear , tydeus ' son wounded brave agastrophus , son of paeon , on the hip
0	it 's difficult for one man ,
0	something he might give you for your house
0	around achilles , huge waves towered threateningly , beating down his shield
0	resourceful odysseus replied to him and said :
0	with fifty in each group
0	eumaeus , i will tell the truth , all the details , to wise penelope ,
0	and when he 's dead they all make fun of him
0	with this heroic push of the individual into the universal , with this attempt to stride out over the limits of individuation and to wish to be oneself a world being , man suffers in himself the contradiction hidden in things , that is , he violates the laws and he suffers
0	but when the two men had approached each other , moving close together , godlike achilles was the first to speak :
0	i may know him , a man like that
0	what laestrygonian antiphates had done
0	they all bit their lips , astonished that he would spoken out so boldly
0	i wish these suitors now inside our home
0	those fighting in the ranks in front , including glorious hector , moved back somewhat , as far as a long javelin flies when it 's been thrown by a man in competition showing off his strength , or in a battle with a murderous enemy— that 's how far achaeans forced the trojans to move back
0	he strung it with ease and shot an arrow
0	i took him to the house , entertained him
0	he looks as if he 's going to a dance , or if he 's sitting down right after dancing
0	pushed me off course , as i was doubling back
0	and , on the other hand , what if , to turn the issue around , it was clearly during the time of their dissolution and weakness that the greeks became constantly more optimistic , more superficial , more hypocritical , with a lust for logic and rational understanding of the world , as well as more cheerful and more scientific ?
0	to gods that you would see him reach that age
0	here they found soldiers hard pressed in the fight
0	alas , what great sorrow for achaea !
0	when they would made the mound , they started to return
0	when diomedes , skilled in war cries , noticed ares , he shuddered—just a man crossing a large plainstops at a raging river rushing to the sea , looks helplessly at swirling foam , and moves away—so tydeus ' son backed off then , saying to his men :
0	where are you from ?
0	hostile to their reckless acts—he was angry
0	i did not come to battle over herebecause of trojans
0	but now , on the basis of what you have just said , i find your thinking questionable
0	by plaiting them together back and forth ,
0	divinely born son of laertes , resourceful odysseus
0	sweet sleep then said in reply :
0	just as east and south winds challenge one another in mountain forests , shaking up deep stands of oak , ash , and tapering cornel trees , hurling slim branches one against the other , with tremendous noise as the branches snap—that 's how trojans and achaeans collided with each other in that conflict
0	some of them soon enough on their way home ,
0	in a difficult harbour , fleeing the storm ,
0	now it 's all happening
0	that 's how a prophet would interpret this , someone who in his heart knew the truth of signs
0	and smashed them on the ground like puppy dogs
0	leaning on his staff , his body dressed in rags
0	for in that choicewe find the joy which we derive from war
0	from crete , where the race of minos lives ,
0	now long-haired achaeans are mocking us , saying we have put forward as a championone who looks good , but lacks a strong brave mind
0	you have to tie me down with still more rope
0	for as i stay here ,
0	nine men in all stood up
0	to a deserted island , and left him there ,
0	they dashed off willingly , their spirits happy to be heading for the hollow ships
0	drink fit for gods
0	with this , she sped on through achaean ranks ,
0	she folded up the clothes , put them in the handsome wagon , harnessed up
0	with just one leap the man will get it done
0	the goddess , silver-footed thetis , set
0	they drove achaeans back , right back to their deep trench , hector at the front , proudly showing off his strength
0	this night before us
0	antilochus , no other achaean warrioris as young as you or quicker on his feet , or as brave in battle
0	in his heart she put courage and strength
0	but there , at the front of the herd , two fearful lions had seized a bellowing bull
0	then he set up , far off in the sands , the mast of a dark-prowed ship
0	to my own son—it would be better for him
0	bronze-armed achaeans , in admiration , may incite someone to fight lord hector
0	i think someday we will be remembering
0	already we breathe the air of a theoretical world , which values the scientific insight higher than the artistic mirror image of a universal principle
0	even zeus , who they say is the greatest of the godsand men , was blinded by her , when hera , a mere female , with her cunning tactics , deceived him that very day alcmenewas to give birth to mighty hercules , in thebes , city with the splendid walls
0	does not please all his listeners alike
0	where all the people passing by made offerings
0	telemachus , philoetius , and eumaeus
0	telemachus returns to ithaca
0	not when i have these sorrows in my heart
0	from people who had many rich estates ,
0	to eternal gods and remember me
0	then euryalus answered him and said :
0	i will go to the place where we assemble ,
0	old ones worn out with toil , young tender girls , with hearts still new to sorrow , and many men
0	but sits there groaning and wailing , in tears ,
0	many fell halfway before they reached white skin , skewered in the earth , still longing to taste flesh
0	in the spirit of this aesthetic the first experiments were made in the leading amateur circles of florence by the poets and singers patronized there
0	shrewd odysseus glared at him and answered :
0	in their hearts they were amazed
0	after these words , the two men lay down beside the road , among the corpses
0	none of them suspected anything
0	as he was thinking , phoebus apollo approached in the form of asius , a strong young man , horse-taming hector 's uncle , hecuba 's blood brother , dymas ' son , who lived by the river sangarius in phrygia
0	but now i grieve
0	you ’ re here because deathless gods despise you
0	i wo not be coming back ?
0	but go away for now , in case hera catches on
0	you have not visited—your home 's so far away
0	they all churned the water with their oar-blades , terrified of being killed
0	but he stood firm , like a rock—
0	then they went back to alcinous ' home to feast
0	and spread a fleece on top
0	i have come now because some people claim
0	for zeus was bringing us a wretched fate
0	and a master 's punishment can be severe—
0	my father and my family
0	you wretched creatures , where are you going ?
0	for a symbol of such a cultural form , we would have to set up socrates the player of music , in the sense talked about earlier
0	from far away , pallas athena added her voice , too , causing great consternation among the trojans
0	a broad-beamed vessel which can move across
0	i am dreadfully afraid for the danaans
0	alcimedon , what achaean warrioris better able to control and guidethese strong immortal horses than yourself , except patroclus , a man as wise as gods , while he was alive ?
0	you have no compassionfor your infant child , for me , your sad wife , who before long will be your widow
0	just like a silly child
0	your dancers were the best , and now , indeed ,
0	my dear child , will you agree to do what i ask of you , or will you refuse , because you are angry with me in your heart , since i help danaans and you aid the trojans ?
0	he 's not in trouble , but sits there in peace ,
0	you want to test me , old man , by asking me of godlike hector
0	on the cargo and his profit
0	from the city they soon brought cattle and stout sheep , sweet wine and bread from home
0	just as dogs and country farmers chase a horned stag or wild goat , but the creature saves itself in a sheer rock face or dark underbrush , and men have no luck finding it , but their shoutsattract a bearded lion to their path , who scatters them , despite their eagerness—that 's how danaans for a while continued to press on in groups , thrusting away with swords and double-bladed spears
0	recall your battle fury
0	rather than more wealth in gold or clothes
0	as the furrow laid down by a team of mules
0	forget being so amazed
0	once he would finished working at these tasks , he lit a fire
0	when they reached the ditch and towers round the ships , the sentries there were starting to prepare their meal
0	whichever one comes out victorious , the stronger man , let him seize all the goods , and take the woman as his wife back home
0	it 's hard to keep the families and childrensafe for everyone
0	my child , here 's a manyou seem to be neglecting totally , a special favourite of yours—achilles
0	of the rebellious giants
0	when i went there and his home sheltered me
0	singers win honour and respect
0	return back to the yard—they skip ahead ,
0	back on my native soil , for all i have suffered
0	a mid-sea course on the windward side of crete
0	any inner power or strength , not like
0	she looked like golden-arrowed goddess artemis
0	he 's asking to be sent away back home
0	she quickly reachedthe spacious home of hector , killer of men
0	now , from the acting area the clarity and solemnity of the epic form speaks to him ; now dionysus no longer speaks through forces but as an epic hero , almost with the language of homer
0	in the district , even when the dead man
0	menelaus , too , was troubled with anxieties
0	we would have had to sweat it out to end it
0	over there in troy
0	all of them , gave him gifts and filled his bag ,
0	your mother , hera , has an implacable , unyielding spirit
0	when you came here
0	so odysseus and her servants could keep up on foot
0	but he stayed behind , by his curved seaworthy ships , still enragedat agamemnon , atreus ' son , the people 's shepherd
0	they all sat there in silence , saying nothing
0	he sees more extensively and profoundly than ever , and yet wishes he were blind
0	and there perform as many funeral rites
0	if anyone hears groans inside this room
0	this tremendous difference , which opens up a yawning gap between plastic art as apollonian and music as dionysian art became more or less obvious to only one great thinker , when he , without any prompting from the symbolism of the greek gods , recognized the different character of music and the origin of all other arts from it , because music is not , like all the others art forms , images of appearances , but an immediate reflection of the will itself , and also because it presents itself as the metaphysical counterpart to all physical things in the world , the thing-in-itself as counterpart to all appearances ( schopenhauer , world as will and idea , i , p )
0	did poseidon stir the winds into a furious storm and strike your ships ?
0	why do you compare me to immortals ?
0	for these men pay me no respect at all ,
0	but you can stretch out here , in the house , putting bedding on the floor
0	when he set off for troy so long ago
0	until you reach your native land and home ,
0	oh father zeus , if you wished to bring me over land and sea
0	it is much rather a world possessing the same reality and credibility for the devout greek as the world of olympus , together with its inhabitants
0	and make the iron strong—that 's how his eye
0	those comrades i had trusted feasted there , eating the cattle they had rounded up ,
0	i told it to you and your noble wife
0	wounded by bronze spears , who would died in war ,
0	full of corn , was sailing to dulichium
0	so do not throw those long spears of yours at them , not all at once
0	it is a god who brought all this about
0	take this food , and give it to the stranger
0	beside them she then set up a polished table
0	and , like a fool , he swilled it down
0	they all fled back , once they would seen their king struck through the heart , lying there in the pile of bodies
0	resourceful odysseus , son of laertes and a child of zeus ,
0	diomedes was stripping the gleaming breast plate off the chest of strong agastrophus , taking , too , the shield from off his shoulders and his heavy helmet
0	saying this , she plunged into the crashing sea
0	he spoke to me :
0	he took up his weapons and spoke—his words had wings :
0	as the goddess said these words , she dispersed the mist
0	who surpassed all men in prophecy ,
0	he 's got one life , no more
0	no other wind sprang up ,
0	thus , you , above all , should speak and listen , then act upon what other men may say , if their spirit prompts them to speak well
0	the city and its land
0	and your name was mentioned in our home ,
0	neleus would not let me take up arms
0	many men had fallen down on top of him , when cronos ' son intensifiedfierce conflict
0	eumaeus looked around , then picked up a stool lying where a servant usually sat
0	from such a trip , over the misty sea ,
0	and fight with all his heart
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	in that existence as dismembered god dionysus has the dual nature of a cruelly savage daemon and a lenient , gentle master
0	made the journey home in the same day
0	then they stood up , dissolving the assembly by the ships
0	you yourself know it
0	my son , we must let this man lie here , for all our grief
0	agreeing with what he would said , they stood up and moved away
0	antiphates then raised a hue and cry
0	and , with their arrogance , they draw our wine ,
0	shrewd telemachus then answered her :
0	she made us lie down in a row and threw
0	each leader killed his enemy
0	lord odysseus would have killed still more lycians , if hector of the flashing helmet had not seen him , then gone through the ranks in front , armed in shining bronze , terrifying danaans
0	he left outside , in the open courtyard
0	as odysseus said these words , pale fear seized everyone
0	and spilling over , enough to clean one 's clothing , even garments really soiled , they took the mules
0	full of joy , carrying a costly present ,
0	so he has paid for everything in full
0	and our complete destruction 's plain to see
0	he showed me all the rich possessions
0	the gods gathered there in zeus ' house
0	for you to lean on , then give it me
0	he embraced the earth and kissed it—shedding numerous warm tears—he was so delighted
0	he fell onto his back down in the dust
0	feasting on that rich supply of meat ,
0	the joyful day of your return come soon ,
0	but then the troops came up with agamemnon , all together
0	and , with a nod of my head , ordering them
0	at that point we generally find a decisive secularization , a break with the unconscious metaphysics of its previous existence , together with all its ethical consequences
0	sent an attendant out to bring back presents
0	even men on foot were not confident about it
0	a full and proper sacrifice , and gods
0	for i am not hurt that agamemnon , the army 's shepherd , urges armed achaeans on to battle
0	over to a husband
0	and led the daughter home to be his brother 's wife
0	my heart has suffered , all those torments
0	resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
0	greedy beggars who disrupt our banquets ?
0	he stumbled and fell
0	it lasts all year long
0	on his bier , closing up his eyes in death ,
0	you ajaxes , both argive leaders , menelaus , leave that corpse to the rest of our best men , who will stand firm around it
0	who was just about to raise up to his lips
0	when dawn in her yellow robe rose from ocean 's stream , bringing her light to immortal gods and mortal men , thetis reached the ships bearing hephaestus ' gifts
0	to send me home
0	let her ask me then about her husband
0	they are crowding in the city , while you chase off on a diversion here
0	but before they left he sent me away
0	patroclus obeyed his dear companion
0	a nymph , a daughter of that phorcys
0	saying this , he turned away , thinking it shameful
0	but we have slaughtered
0	the finest in the land
0	this chorus in its vision gazes at its lord and master dionysus and is thus always the chorus of servants
0	i took great pains
0	in running fast and fighting well
0	as he was moving from the island thrinacia
0	he sees me first and , knowing all my plans , escapes me
0	in all sorts of ways , a courageous man ,
0	once they would reached the boat , they dragged the black ship into deeper water ,
0	he would come up from the sea and seated himself there , pitying achaeans , as trojans beat them back , and nursing a powerful anger against zeus
0	inside she met her many servants and bid them all lament
0	when fair-haired demeter was overcome
0	they gave a piercing cry which woke up lord odysseus
0	if somehow he 's a god come down from heaven
0	so they could be compelled to work for them
0	i cut back the foliage , by removing
0	i will return at sunrise , and i will bring you lovely armour made by lord hephaestus
0	my heart 's preoccupied with troubles now ,
0	was lost at sea
0	you come up to every man , one by one ,
0	they moved there and sat down on polished stones arranged in rows
0	but when achilles saw them , his anger grew
0	i wish that on that day my mother bore mesome evil wind had come , carried me away , and swept me off , up into the mountains , or to the waves of the tumbling , crashing sea
0	to flowing water and a towering tree
0	here we do not see any more the epic dissolution of the self in appearances , the disinterested coolness of the real actor , who remain , even in his highest achievements , totally appearance and delight in appearances
0	the old man finished speaking
0	great-hearted trojans i have just slaughteredwill rise again , up out of murky darkness , if this man 's avoided death , returned like this , after i would sold him off in sacred lemnos
0	all day long , the sail stayed full , and we sped on across the sea , until the sun went down
0	anyone who has sensed in the platonic texts the merest scent of the god-like naïveté and confidence in the direction of socrates 's teaching has also felt how that immense drive wheel of socratic logic is , at it were , in motion behind socrates and how we have to see this behind socrates , as if we were looking through a shadow
0	when companies of trojans hurled at me
0	what euripides in aristophanes ' frogs gives himself credit for as a service , namely , that through his household medicines he freed tragic art of its pompous hustle and bustle , that point we can trace above all in his tragic heroes
0	but if you are keen to hear them ,
0	i give him to you
0	to get back quickly to my native land
0	their crying and moaning echoed through the house
0	while much-enduring lord odysseus slept there ,
0	a picture image of the truth of things
0	what are her thoughts and plans ?
0	but say what 's on your mind
0	our hearts were resolute
0	friend , i myself am not all that eager
0	we have signs only we two understand
0	mentor has moved away ,
0	using his wise judgment ,
0	remote from me , so my dear wife could go
0	is there perhaps ( a question for doctors who treat madness ) a neurosis associated with health , with the youth of a people , and with youthfulness ?
0	using brute force in that hollow cave of yours
0	we will soon take him over to the mainland ,
0	when they reached diomedes ' well-constructed hut , they tethered the horses with cut straps in the stall where diomedes ' own swift horses stood , munching their sweet grain
0	hephaestus spoke , then stood up , passed a double gobletacross to his dear mother , saying :
0	they charged into a tamarisk bush and snapped the pole on the curved chariot , right at the very end
0	in a fight , even if a great quarrel comes
0	eurynome , though my heart was never keen before to show myself
0	that man began our strife
0	but come , speak openly and tell me this—
0	odysseus had described to her
0	zeus ' mind has changed
0	stretched out he covered seven hundred feet
0	but leave behind a pair of swords , two spears ,
0	come , patroclus , born from zeus , fetch the girl
0	hector was in the crowd there with them , grimly killing with chariot and spear , decimating young men 's ranks
0	once agamemnon spoke , the men stopped fighting , quickly falling silent
0	she reached for her son 's goblet
0	well , now i think you will pay for all you have done
0	going up to each man and reassuring him :
0	i am begging you , if ever in word or deed
0	instead , the sirens ' clear-toned song will captivate his heart
0	the most proper style of our aestheticians is to exercise their lame wits on such a collection and to overlook the phenomenon which is really worth explaining
0	and so for me
0	godlike otus and famed ephialtes
0	hector , you are right in what you say against me
0	the wide rumour of the suitors ' murder
0	hear me now—i wish to tell a story ,
0	for all the suitors
0	i paused , and he immediately replied :
0	will speed him on his way
0	their tears made the sands wet , men 's armour , too , for they were mourning the loss of a great warrior , who would made men flee
0	now the issue 's clear—either we will be killed or we will be saved , if we can push the danger from our ships
0	this view , combined with that historical tradition that originally the tragedy consisted entirely of the chorus , reveals itself for what it is , a crude and unscholarly , although dazzling , claim
0	they will honour him with all their hearts ,
0	so i moved back again , kept on swimming ,
0	her housekeeper , and said :
0	slain by cruel bronze , and pray to the gods ,
0	the whole floor swam with blood
0	my friends , stand by him , keep in your heartsyour sense of shame , in case the myrmidonsstrip off his armour and mutilate his corpse , in their anger at the dead danaans , the ones killed by our spears at their fast ships
0	i am on my way to inform warlike achilles of the newswhich geranian nestor , achaea 's guardian , asked me to report
0	until i finish all i need to do in here
0	circe , grant me the promise which you made
0	father zeus , you keep afflicting humans with great blindness
0	they had not been wise
0	but now he 's grown—his youth has reached its limit—
0	odysseus ' dear son rejoiced
0	to recognize someone 's inheritance
0	she does not turn down
0	to get weapons in their hands to fight a war
0	tell me the truth , so i can understand—
0	around his head and shoulders the goddess put a fiery glow , then drove him forward , right into the middle of the strife , the killing zone , where most warriors fight
0	if he bumped into us : who 's the man
0	and men say i am the finest of all goddessesin a double sense—both by my lineageand my marriage to the ruler of the gods
0	to receive a sacrificial offering to him—
0	in his black ship , back from sandy pylos
0	so euripides as a poet is , above all , the echo of his conscious knowledge , and it is precisely this which confers upon him such a memorable place in the history of greek art
0	or her previous husband whom she loved
0	for fine odysseus in the land of troy ,
0	to hades ' home , having made his prophecy
0	then stirred north wind to rage against our ships—
0	shaking his head , zeusthen spoke to his own heart :
0	why are you trying to irritate that savage ?
0	take good care of them ,
0	for atreus ' son would never make my heartso totally enraged here in my chest , nor would he take that girl away from me , so arbitrarily against my will , if zeus did not somehow desire the deathsof argives in large numbers
0	she went at the archer goddess , insulting her :
0	to think of ways to force these suitors out ,
0	hera went to the assembled ships , with pallas athena and poseidon , who shakes the earth
0	that will pain your heart to pay—your sorrow
0	shrewd telemachus then answered her and said :
0	would let a tear fall on his cheek for one whole day , not even if his mother and his father died ,
0	are not as steady as they used to be
0	swift-footed achilles , in a towering fury , then answered apollo :
0	he was totally despised by all the gods
0	on the opposing side , well-armed achaeans carried tlepolemus away from battle
0	old horseman peleus would cry with grief , noble counselor of the myrmidons
0	i do not fancy staying here unvalued , to pile up riches , treasures just for you
0	but when the girl was going to harness up the mules and start to fold the splendid clothes to make the journey homeward , athena , bright-eyed goddess , thought of something else ,
0	and they have won respect reserved for gods
0	the two proceeded on through weapons and black blood
0	rest in peace , patroclus , though you are in hades ' house
0	drink some sparkling wine , till hecamedewith the lovely hair draws you a warm bathand washes the dried blood off your body
0	for her first voyage
0	then i would be more beautiful and famous
0	who had not learned what courage is
0	filled up with chariots and infantry ,
0	until then the greeks had felt involuntarily impelled to relate all their experiences immediately to their myths , indeed to understand them only in this relation
0	went out and tied a ram and a black ewe
0	he spoke , then tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a large pillar , threw one end above the round house , then pulled it taut and high , so no woman 's foot could reach the ground
0	she provokes me so with her abuse
0	you must carefully select three comrades ,
0	his spear first struck him in the back , between the shoulder blades , as he turned to flee
0	both his head and neck were covered with the dung he would groveled in and grabbed up by the handful
0	son of peleus , do not try to scare me off with words , as ifi were a child
0	and set up their ambush for telemachus
0	where your lady mother and your father lived ,
0	antinous spoke , and what he would just proposed they found agreeable
0	i would smash his brains out on the ground in here , sprinkle them in every corner of this cave , and then my heart would ease the agonies
0	we heard all he said to you there in his house
0	telemachus , your well-armed companions
0	saying this , nausicaa cracked the shining whip
0	so the two men
0	o nestor , son of neleus , great gloryof achaeans , if a god wanted to , he would easily give even better horses ,
0	of shipwrecks or disaster
0	but when you see our son has grown a beard , then marry who you wish , and leave the house
0	that 's how the goddess graced his head and shoulders
0	for apollo , god with the silver bow , and ares ,
0	even though you are really shrewd
0	and control swift-footed horses , those things which soon decide the outcome of the fight in an impartial war
0	swift-footed achilles greeted them and said :
0	and came to the fine harbour where we found
0	there he gave them to his dear companion deïpylus , whom he esteemedabove all others the same age as himself , since they both thought alike
0	they were so terrified they dropped their weapons and all fell on the ground , at that goddess ' resounding voice
0	to rid your halls of them
0	but if what i say is horrifying and terrible , then the hairs on my head stand on end from fright , and my heart knocks
0	looks at a minstrel who sings enticing songs
0	great torments , which the shaker of the earth ,
0	i think disaster looms
0	by those swift dogs you yourself have raised ,
0	or any slaves in lord odysseus ' home
0	went through the house , head bowed , with foreboding in his heart , for he had a sense of troubles
0	just like a lion
0	phoenix , dear old father , noble lord , i do not need such honours , for i possesshonour in the will of zeus
0	ilioneus collapsed , stretching out his arms
0	when they would come to close quarters , facing one another , diomedes , expert in war cries , was the first to speak :
0	let 's fight and not hold back our spears , so we can see if achilles kills us both , then takes the bloodstained trophies to the ships , or whether you will destroy him on your spear
0	you gods that live at ease were jealous of her ,
0	troops from phylace , flowering pyrasus , shrine of demeter , iton , where flocks breed , antrum by the sea , and grassy pteleum— brave protesilaus had led these men , while still alive
0	if you are keen to infiltratethe trojan army , over there are thracians , fresh troops , new arrivals , furthest distantfrom the rest , among them their king rhesus , son of eioneus
0	he crashed on the ground and lay there motionless
0	in a contest with their bows
0	across the misty sea
0	it was your wife who hit me , father , white-armed hera
0	i was third in command , on their orders
0	there 's nothing i can do
0	go on your way
0	i received them both in my residenceand entertained them
0	and could the greek serenity of later greek periods be only a red sunset ?
0	of the very finest men , just because
0	but apollo of the silver bow had not been unvigilant , once he would perceived athena taking care of tydeus ' son
0	when i get back ,
0	using her judgment with the whip , she drove on
0	even in the world below zeus honours them
0	both of these universals , however , are , from a certain point of view , contrary , since ideas consist only of forms abstracted first from perception , rather like the stripped away outer skin of things , and are thus really and entirely abstractions
0	is put to the test between these suitors
0	as they were tasting samples of the innards
0	thus they talked to one another of these things
0	that 's where warlike ajax and achilles lie ,
0	like a vulture , meriones leapt out again , pulled the heavy spear out of his upper arm , then moved back to his group , but deïphobus ' blood brother polites , with both arms round his waist , hauled him from the fight , until he came to his swift horses in the rear
0	how must we derive this curious internal bifurcation , this blunting of the apollinian point , if not from the dionysian magic that , though apparently exciting the apollinian emotions to their highest pitch , still retains the power to force into its service his excess of apollinian force ?
0	which men will learn about in years to come
0	went off , as alcinous had ordered , to the shore
0	with these words he set into odysseus ' hands
0	it seems to me you know how to compete ,
0	sitting bolt upright , he said :
0	from that point , mount ida was clearly visible , priam 's city , too , and the achaean ships
0	to lord poseidon with a ram , a bull ,
0	when the sun had left the splendid sea and risen up into an all-bronze heaven , giving light to gods
0	but when wise penelope
0	his men followed , shouting loudly
0	now i am hurt and suffering , i am holding back ,
0	there he sits in front of his beaked ships , mourning his dear companion
0	to free your crew and entertain you
0	shedding many tears of grief
0	you ought to be ashamed
0	if indeed it 's true he is odysseus
0	all in due order , then spread the white sail out
0	the close-fitting door of that storage room
0	before now , you have not been too reckless or a fool
0	he stretched out his arms ,
0	he sent their diver back , grieving for his team
0	but it ripped apart two layers on that protective shield
0	and laughter-loving aphrodite left for paphos ,
0	tell me this , and speak straight and to the point
0	since odysseus went to wicked ilion ,
0	in this state , pure understanding , as it were , comes to us , to save us from willing and the pressures of willing
0	since there 's no greater glory for a man
0	on the opposite side , within the courtyard , were twelve roofed rooms , all made of polished stone ,
0	yet they heard me and followed my advice
0	just as when archer artemis
0	i will now set up this contest for the suitors
0	the strength drained out of him where he was standing
0	and give rash speeches
0	the old man then spied odysseus and asked :
0	looking at him , swift-footed , godlike achilles felt pity
0	to meet some well-known kings in an assembly—
0	because you overcame that beggar irus ?
0	with them came thirty hollow ships
0	or else you have found out from some other man
0	proud king oeneus had no living sons , and he himself was dead , as was fair-haired meleager
0	as he goes down to hades , the mighty gatekeeper , his heart , i think , will be pleased i have given him an escort
0	cloud gatherer zeus then answered hera , saying :
0	at this point , the trojans , having fled like deer , spread out through the city , resting by its sturdy walls , drying their sweat and taking drink to slake their thirst
0	sit down there , and wait a while ,
0	this moment marked the start of his final rush to death
0	at dawn idaios went out to the hollow ships
0	thetis , shedding tears , answered her son , achilles :
0	for he revered the gods who live for ever
0	by enemies on land
0	as troops moved up tightly bunched , men 's eyes went blind in the blaze of glittering bronze , glaring helmets ,
0	then went down to my ship and told my crew
0	divided up between them
0	gained strength , we held our ground and beat them back , for all their greater numbers
0	old eurycleia went up to an upstairs room ,
0	out from under the altar that snake slithered , darting for the plane tree , where there laytiny , new-born sparrows , eight fledglings , huddled under foliage at the very top
0	and speak candidly—was the place ransacked ,
0	he missed ajax , but hit leucus , a brave companion of odysseus , in the groin , as he was dragging simoeisius away
0	we moved down to our swift ship by the shore ,
0	how will i end up ?
0	to arrange an escort for your journey home
0	schopenhauer , who did not hide from the difficulty which the lyric poet creates for the philosophical observer of art , believed that he had discovered a solution ( something which i can not go along with ) when in his profound metaphysics of music he found a way setting the difficulty decisively to one side , as i believe i have done in his spirit and with due honour to him
0	in a wrestling match with philomeleides
0	dawn soon came on her golden throne
0	she mustered a force of volunteers in pylos , all keen for war
0	give me your armour to buckle round my shoulders , so trojans , mistaking me for you , may stop the fight
0	their meanings are not clear , and for people
0	when did he leave ?
0	so achilles gave the great sword to diomedes— the scabbard and the well-cut strap as well
0	are you really willing to leave troy , city of wide streets , for whose sake we have borne so many evils ?
0	when someone else runs into me and says
0	because he pitied me ,
0	where each met his bitter fate—but zeus ,
0	first , my noble father 's perished , the man
0	when goddess dawn rose high up on olympus , bringing light to zeus and the immortals , agamemnon bid the loud-voiced heralds summonall the long-haired achaeans to assembly
0	but the rest of the long-haired achaeanswill stay here , until we demolish troy
0	achilles lost his footing
0	raise the mast , spread your white sail , and just take your seat
0	if one of the achaeans wants to bring
0	but when agamemnon , hit by a spearor wounded with an arrow , mounts his chariot , then i will give hector power to kill and kill , until he moves up to the well-decked ships , at sunset , when sacred darkness comes
0	not to disgrace your ancestral family—
0	if you are keen to come , there 's no way i would stop you boarding my trim ship
0	he has no way of getting back to his own land—he lacks
0	they had no idea telemachus had gone
0	especially me—however far i travel ,
0	to serve the suitors , every one of them
0	for yesterday zeus went to oceanus , to banquet with the worthy ethiopians
0	to carry more fine armour from the storeroom
0	shall i speak up and pretend ,
0	you know it 's things like these that help to make a noble reputation among men
0	if odysseus himself had not called a halt and said :
0	report this message to achaean leaders—that 's the privilege of senior men—their minds must come up with some better planto save the achaean fleet and armybeside the hollow ships
0	they went away , and my heart was laughing—
0	once the thigh parts were completely roasted
0	once sunrise comes , the story will be out
0	fear gripped all the myrmidons
0	three times he yelled , as loud as any man can shout
0	then his noble mother movedbeside him , as he was groaning bitterly
0	they were discussingtwo alternatives , each one pleasing some of them— whether to attack that city and plunder it , or to accept as payment half of all the goods contained in that fair town
0	by our swift ships
0	even a grain of salt from your own house
0	the sail and yard arm dropped down into the sea , some distance off
0	he went to join the group of finely dressed achaeans
0	the shade of atreus ' son then answered amphimedon :
0	in your halls , as you just claimed
0	my lord , in this you must not criticize your daughter ,
0	lord odysseus , we went through the woods , as you had ordered and , in a clearing there , found a splendid house built of polished stone ,
0	when they have to face the pain and sorrow
0	it is certainly the sign of the breach of which everyone speaks as the fundamental malady of modern culture , that the theoretical man , alarmed and dissatisfied at his own consequences , no longer dares entrust himself to the terrible icy current of existence : he runs timidly up and down the bank
0	ajax slew laodamas , noble antenor 's son , who led up troops on foot
0	whoever in these circles has not completely exhausted himself in his endeavor to be a dependable corrector of old texts or a linguistic microscopist who apes natural history is probably trying to assimilate greek antiquity historically , along with other antiquities , at any rate according to the method and with the supercilious airs of our present cultured historiography
0	watching him , the father of gods and men pitied hector
0	and if your heart is angry about this ,
0	he came here with his armour—an amazing sight—huge and made of gold
0	indeed , it must also be historically demonstrable how that period rich in folk songs at the same time was stirred in the strongest manner by dionysian trends , something which we have to recognize as the foundation and precondition of folk songs
0	adreste came with her
0	once he would said this ,
0	things wo not change at alluntil the two of us go out to challengediomedes with a chariot and horses , until we confront him with our weapons
0	you are on fire with grief , faces wet with tears , fine pedestals and walls have gobs of blood ,
0	what else but the perpetuum vestigum [ the enternal mark ] of a union between the apollonian and the dionysian
0	they had to do—as if you yourself were there
0	for all my heavy groaning , since that storm
0	beside his brother thrasymedes and his father
0	the suitors reached out with their hands to grab the tasty food prepared and placed in front of them
0	with these words , the two men jumped out of their chariots , clasped hands and pledged their mutual friendship
0	achilles , peleus ' son , of all achaeansthe mightiest by far
0	we would sent hermes earlier to speak to him
0	may people someday say , as he returns from war , 'this man is far better than his father
0	and there 's no glory
0	and then provide the correct interpretation ?
0	for through their ancestry they stem from paeeon
0	i suspect , by contrast , that with our present worship of naturalism and realism we are situated at the opposite pole from all idealism , namely , in the region of a wax works collection
0	that said , pallas athena led off rapidly—
0	let each answer this question according to his own feelings : he will at any rate show by his answer his conception of culture , provided he at least tries to answer the question , and has not already become dumbfounded with astonishment
0	they then lay down to rest and took the gift of sleep
0	her nights and days always end in sorrow ,
0	a very strong affection for odysseus
0	then helen , goddess among women , said to priam :
0	while you turn to face the flowing rivers , looking backwards
0	poetry itself is lost with it !
0	you do not pity trojans as they are butchered
0	though i am in pain , i have told the truth in this
0	if i rush away before achilleswhere other men are running in their panic , he will catch me , then kill me as a coward
0	next , he placed the great anvil on its block , took up a massive hammer in one hand and in the other his tongs
0	godlike priam then said in reply to hecuba :
0	so he produces marvelous work , that 's how athena poured grace onto his head and shoulders , as he came out of his bath , looking like the immortal gods
0	and when we discussed our strategies
0	worms had nibbled on the horns
0	dreadson of cronos , how can you say this ?
0	stepped from the ship
0	he sent him roughly off with harsh abusive ordersthe old man went away again , enraged
0	as he went , he raised his legs high , striving against the current
0	in twelve days , when he returns and comes home to olympus , i will go to zeus ' bronze-floored house , clasp his knee
0	he spoke up at once , addressing the phaeacians ,
0	says she will be leaving with another man ,
0	telemachus visits nestor in pylos
0	that old man with still more troubles
0	the old man did not visit them to explain their dreams , for mighty diomedes slaughtered both of them
0	then melanthius the goatherd answered him :
0	in your home from tomorrow on , since you
0	a long way off , those same ethiopians ,
0	they quickly rushed away to get their weapons
0	so that this stranger , with us escorting him
0	that 's what i propose—let zeus be my witness
0	get lots of wood , so all night long , until first light of dawn , we can burn many fires , lighting up the sky
0	or go off with the best of those achaeans
0	eumaeus , i hope father zeus likes you
0	for there 's no benefit in frigid tears
0	my spear has sent you running once before
0	and these actions will consist , for the most part , like those of a mid-wife , of things concerned with the education of noble disciples , in order to produce an endless supply of geniuses
0	is more painful still—it could not save him
0	well known to all for my deceptive skills—
0	dark blood flowed down
0	or a stupid man , if you have in you now
0	zeus then boasted openly to all the gods ,
0	someone on a distant farm without a neighbour
0	discovered the plump seals , looked at each one ,
0	silver , and ivory , and then across it
0	then i can pass through the gates of hades
0	antilochus , you have not paid that tribute here for nothing
0	to take some bread and offer it to me
0	my bridal room , and my own husband , too ,
0	still , i am not chasing anyone away
0	teucer hit him with an arrow on the gleaming strap around his chest which held his protective shield
0	the dithyrambic chorus is a chorus of transformed people , for whom their civic past , their social position , is completely forgotten
0	and so right there the first philosophical problem posed an awkward insoluble contradiction between man and god and pushed it right up to the door of that culture , like a boulder
0	swift ajax , son of oïleus , was the first to recognize the god
0	if they do not pay me proper retribution
0	but when we would ransacked priam 's lofty city
0	the godlike minstrel honoured by his people ,
0	be prudent , kind , or gentle from now on ,
0	he had such shabby clothing covering his body
0	then helen , long-robed goddess among women , answered :
0	on the other hand , by means of the same tragic myth , in the person of the tragic hero ; it knows how to redeem us from the greedy thirst for this existence , and with an admonishing gesture it reminds us of another existence and a higher pleasure for which the struggling hero prepares himself by means of his destruction , not by means of his triumphs
0	shipmates , although you are suffering distress , hear me out
0	he really stirred the heart of warlike peneleus
0	has set off in a hollow ship—poor child—
0	she would given him both bad and good , for she would destroyed his eyes , but had bestowed on him the gift of pleasing song
0	who kept assigning me the harshest tasks
0	she made no attempt to use her fingers
0	as old men should
0	so these two looped the cords of powerful war and deadly strife around both contending armies , then pulled them taut , a knot no one could undo or slip away from , a knot that broke the limbs of many fighting men
0	no matter who he was or what he needed
0	he may reach dawn with her golden throne
0	bound for cyprus , dmetor , son of iasus ,
0	but euphorbus , son of panthous , with his ash spear , also knew that brave patroclus had been killed
0	around it on both sides
0	i wish i could hide him from distressful death , when his cruel fate arrives , as surelyas i know there will be fine armour for him— such splendid armour that it will astoundall the many men who chance to see it
0	you must have a strong desire to die ,
0	of lotus-eating men , and all the cyclops did—
0	i am holding you back with my delay , not coming as quickly as you asked
0	we really thought he would killed us there
0	running over , he took up a position by both ajaxes and said :
0	the men kept toiling on without a pause , sweat dripping on their knees and legs , under their feet , and running down men 's eyes and hands , as both sides battled over swift-footed achilles ' brave companion
0	taking her female servants to her room upstairs
0	take a golden cord , hang it from heaven
0	on the string , as if prepared to shoot
0	so come , no longer show me such ill will
0	am not unskilled in competition ,
0	we have no special gift
0	and then a great omen appeared , a snake , blood-red along its back , a dreadful sight , a thing sent out by zeus into the daylight
0	in the presence of immortal gods
0	and just as tragedy , with its metaphysical consolation , draws attention to the eternal life of that existential core in the continuing destruction of appearances , so the symbolism of the satyr chorus already expresses metaphorically that primordial relationship between the thing-in-itself and appearances
0	this morning early , a wagon and some mules ,
0	i do not blame any olympianas much as i blame my own dear mother , who led me astray with lies , telling mei would die from the swift arrows of apollo , under trojan walls and fully armed
0	the bow fell from his hands
0	those phoenicians , truly crafty men , seduced her
0	one of his horses had been hurt , hit by an arrow on its head , right on top , that spot where on a horse hairs begin to grow out from the skull , a deadly place
0	talthybius swung the body round , then threw it in the vast gray sea , food for fish
0	so it followed a straight line
0	and fell out , a long way from the raft
0	that land is where she said i would be saved
0	the phaeacians , so celebrated for their ships ,
0	tell me , who 's that large man , over there , that impressive , strong achaean ?
0	and explained its features
0	they agreed with what he would said
0	the worthy swineherd had picked up the curving bow and was carrying it
0	the finest in my flocks
0	just as from a high peak of some massive mountain , zeus , who gathers lightning , shifts a bulky cloud , once more revealing all the peaks , high headlands , and mountain glades , while from heaven the huge bright sky
0	meanwhile , aphrodite and apollo , with his silver bow , are enjoying themselves , happy about this madman they have unleashed , who has no sense of what 's appropriate
0	no longer exercise their power , slaves
0	muse , tell me this—which of them were the very best of those who came over with the sons of atreus ?
0	a word from you
0	on the other side , higher up the sloping plain , the trojans did the same
0	in well-stitched leather sacks
0	so give back argive helen and her property , compensate us with a suitable amount , something future ages will all talk about
0	i will go to sparta , land of lovely women ,
0	i am always going in among the trojans , and i claim i do not malinger by the ships , although i am an old man for a warrior
0	the way i would a god , and i have come here
0	and sat me on a silver-studded chair ,
0	together with eumaeus and philoetius
0	then splendid hector , calling with a shout , announced that he would come forward to confront achilles
0	still , though it hurts , we should let all this pass , repressing hearts within our chests—we must do that
0	you who rule on high , yes indeed , aegisthus
0	the blow from zeus ' lightning made our boat
0	since i first left the mountain snows of crete ,
0	but with a spear , that 's more difficult—they are so much stronger
0	the immeasurable suffering of the brave individual , on the one hand , and , on the other , the peril faced by the gods , even a presentiment of the twilight of the gods , the compelling power for a metaphysical oneness , for a reconciliation of both these worlds of suffering—all this is a powerful reminder of the central point and major claim of the aeschylean world view , which sees fate ( moira ) enthroned over gods and men as eternal justice
0	helped me stand again , and brought me home ,
0	you would fight any man you saw avoiding battle , fleeing war 's brutality
0	while the men kept on fighting at the well-decked ships ,
0	i offered many prayers , with promises
0	we will be successful in what we are doing
0	wise eurycleia , telemachus is telling you to lock up
0	and his many wanderings , will come home
0	the battered timbers on the tower rattled
0	when cows , having had their fill of grazing ,
0	you will not come up with other devious plans
0	at hermes ' words , laughter arose from the immortal deities
0	such beautiful prizes in your honour
0	a large , fine place , with cleared land all around
0	hector , here the two of us mingle with danaans , but on the outskirts of this hard-fought battle
0	there will be stories for telemachus and i
0	the axle was completely spattered underneath , as were the rails behind , with gobs of blood thrown up from horses ' hooves and chariot wheels
0	with coverlets spread over them , and then ,
0	dear nurse , the gods have made you mad
0	glossary of people and places
0	on her head she placed a double-ridged gold helmet , men from a hundred cities etched upon its four-part crest
0	what sophocles said about aeschylus—that he does what 's right , without being aware of it—was certainly not said in any euripidean sense
0	the truth about this , too , so i understand—
0	flying off in a rush , the two gods reached ida with its many springs , mother of wild beasts
0	while his mother was coming down mount ida , accompanying her parents to watch their flocks
0	i will go straight through the army , till i reachagamemnon 's ship , where their best menmust be in council talking of their plans , whether to flee or to continue fighting
0	for agamemnon had ordered him repeatedly to keep the horses ready for the time his limbsgrew tired from moving through so many soldiers
0	from his friends and native land much longer
0	they came up through the crowd answering their comrade 's shout
0	but fate had overtaken him by now
0	heralds poured water out for them to wash their hands ,
0	weaving a huge , immortal tapestry ,
0	in splitting dry wood and building a good fire ,
0	i have come back to my native land
0	it 's a nasty thing to accept a pledge
0	will be so overcome with foolishness
0	to prepare a banquet
0	in its great subtlety would not let me speak
0	you can describe the details to your wife
0	his herders and his ploughman will not needto travel to the town through lack of iron
0	perhaps the charioteer let go the reinsand could not guide his chariot round the postand failed to make the turn
0	gone limp—that 's how irus is now sitting
0	they got in at once , moved to the rowing bench ,
0	but there is something much worse about my book , something which i regret even more than to have obscured and spoiled my dionysian premonitions with formulas from schopenhauer : namely , that i generally ruined for myself the magnificent problem of the greeks , as it arose in me , by mixing it up with the most modern issues !
0	my myrmidons , let none of you forget those threats you spoke about by our swift ships , while i was angry—you would go on and on against the trojans
0	the spirit of agamemnon , son of atreus ,
0	by a spear in the strong hand of telemachus
0	that man is laertes ' son , crafty odysseus , raised in rocky ithaca
0	for reality , the world of separate things , supplies clear phenomena , remarkable and individual things , the single case , to both the universality of ideas and the universality of melodies
0	to ambush this divine old man , in case
0	i am just a beggar
0	but when the dogs disfigure shamefullyan old man , chewing his gray head , his beard , his sexual organs , that 's the saddest thing we wretched mortals see
0	i was a son of zeus , child of cronos ,
0	you might well die , come to a quick end on his spear
0	of fresh-carved ivory which fits around it ,
0	they stood in fair-haired circe 's gateway
0	let 's start—fight on , whether for victory or flight
0	yes , this dog belongs to a man who died
0	we can repay ourselves—
0	would send other troubles , since my mother ,
0	abandoning me to tears and sorrow
0	by our ships lies a dead man—unwept , unburied—patroclus
0	next resilient , godlike odysseus tried a lift
0	schedius and epistrophus , sons of iphitus , the son of great-hearted naubolus , commanded phoceans—men from cyparissus , rocky pytho , holy crisa , daulis , and panopeus ; men from anemorea and hyampolis ; from around the sacred river cephisus , from lilaea , beside cephissus ' springs
0	our ship then reached the boundaries of deep-flowing oceanus ,
0	will pay them back
0	a cloak and tunic
0	and how to sail across the fish-filled seas
0	with no sense of law , or kind to strangers , with hearts that fear the gods
0	as a young girl carrying a pitcher
0	this impartial war , in case thundering zeus ,
0	a bad dream had stood beside his head that night , a device sent by athena—and that dream was the son of tydeus
0	hector and the trojans , with a shout , threw volleys of lethal weapons at them
0	think of zeus 's rage
0	move close and dig a hole there two feet square
0	closely linked by marriage
0	and to whom she borne a child , even if
0	i regret that i tied myself to hopes where there was nothing to hope for , where everything indicated all too clearly an end point !
0	they fought lord hector and the trojans spear for spear , shield with layered shield , in close-packed formation , shields linked together and helmet touching helmet , troops shoulder to shoulder
0	attempting to catch anyone who tried
0	and great spear fighters , too
0	sitting high above them , zeus stayed in control
0	has gone to gather news about his father ,
0	on his bent limbs , the hairs stood out , and he stayed there in a daze
0	and left for aegae where he has his splendid home
0	he called out to the trojans , shouting :
0	you are the one who is especially loyal
0	the son of tydeus jumped down onto the ground ,
0	blowing from behind our dark-prowed ship—
0	you never stop working
0	antinous , there 's no way i will dismiss
0	beggars and vagabonds are like
0	got back to his native land , he and his son
0	old man , no wanderer who came with news of him
0	let whoever'sgoing to getthe two-handled cup step forward
0	idomeneus , above all danaans , with their swift horses , i value you in war , in all other things , and at banquets , when achaea ’ s finest prepare gleaming wine , the kind reserved for kings , in mixing bowls
0	here we must think clearly of the tremendous power that stimulated , purified , and discharged the whole life of the people : tragedy
0	melampus was caught trying to help his brother and imprisoned by phylacus , but his prophetic powers persuaded phylacus to release him and give him the cattle
0	has permitted them , for their ships move fast ,
0	i would rather lose my life once and for all
0	the son of peleus ' shade
0	once they reached the splendid palace of the king , they sat down in rows on high-backed chairs and couches
0	he spoke out at once to his phaeacians ,
0	but achilles checked them , keeping soldiers there
0	but now science , incited by its powerful delusion , speeds on inexorably right to its limits , at which point the optimism hidden in the essence of logic fails
0	no man can match your expertise in that
0	you are both younger men than i and i have been colleague of better men than you , men who never showed me any disrespect , men whose like i have not seen again , and never will—like peirithous , dryas ,
0	towards the gloomy darkness in the west—
0	she called her husband ,
0	a god came down in person—for he could ,
0	while in his mind and heart he turned this over , ranks of shield-bearing trojans advanced against him , encircling him
0	he has no bed or bedding—no cloaks
0	but eurycleia 's words could find no wings
0	he would not let them stand up on the earth
0	warrior phaedimus , the sidonian king , presented it to me on my way home ,
0	i saw lord mentor , though by that time
0	he was crude and rough , but now he seems
0	be willing now to stand by me like that , protect me , and i will sacrifice to youan unbroken yearling ox with a broad headwhich no man yet has put beneath the yoke
0	to high olympus , petitioning zeus ,
0	that 's what the suitors said
0	there 's no man to guard our home from ruin ,
0	so jump out there—see if you can hit one of the trojans
0	so there 's no onewho will keep the dogs from going at your head , not even if they bring here and weigh outa ransom ten or twenty times as much , with promises of more , or if priam , son of dardanus , says he will pay your weightin gold
0	thus , we forced her to complete the cloak
0	of a malicious woman
0	the din of smashed-in shields , gates , and horsehair helmets—that sound reached heaven
0	the keen arrow dug into the leather strap , passed right through the finely decorated belt , through the richly embossed armour , the body mail , his most powerful guard , worn to protect his flesh , by blocking spears and arrows
0	today , one of them will mourn a dear dead son
0	and zeus sent blustery west wind blowing in with rain , a steady downpour all night long
0	it 's that time of day
0	menelaus shouted , but antilochus kept going , moving even faster and laying on the whip , as if he had not heard
0	the one whom leto bore , killed both of them ,
0	which he kept there as a change of clothing ,
0	the herdsmen walking by the cattle , four of them , were also made of gold
0	with all his gifts , he 's bringing pleasureto the gods who live in spacious heaven
0	podarcus was iphicles ’ son , child of phylaces
0	may gods give you joyful prosperity
0	but i had one left , guardian of our city , protector of its people
0	come on , some of you get busy here—
0	but now hector was striving to break through the warriors ' ranks , probing them wherever he saw the largest groups , the finest armour
0	his fat flock right inside the spacious cavern ,
0	with these words , the goddess led her inside the house
0	a slur on us
0	inside the home the sicilian servant woman
0	they soon reached the scaean gates
0	i will carry out what you have told me
0	for odysseus was not the only man
0	your chariotand your horses are not here
0	with just a tunic
0	the answer to my many prayers , fleeing poseidon 's punishment from the deep sea
0	the attractive farms of the egyptians ,
0	he moved back into the ranks , among his comrades , avoiding death
0	earthshaker , you would never call me prudent , if i fought with you over human beings—those pitiful creatures are like the leaves , now full of blazing life , eating nourishment the earth provides , then fading into death
0	of anger from the gods , in case their rage
0	i am returning now to windy troy
0	because the day they meet their fate has come
0	once they would washed the clothes and cleaned off all the stains , they laid the items out in rows along the sea shore , right where the waves which beat upon the coast
0	other gods will follow our example
0	as i slept , a dream sent from the gods
0	flocks of sheep and shambling bent-horned cattle
0	then atreus ' warrior son handed telemachus
0	i have had no practice with such formal speech
0	and threw it on the fire
0	so we could get away from this disaster
0	euripides is the actor with the beating heart , with his hair standing on end
0	at banquets , when we achaeans feast our senior men , you hear me call your name out first
0	all his companions , before returning home
0	and they ran off in fear and crouched down here and there among the jutting dunes of sand
0	the shuttle fell out of her hands onto the floor
0	but the public , including the best individuals among them , met him only with a suspicious smile
0	but should zeus , who sees far and wide , not send that messenger , i would not urge you or advise you go there , to achaean ships , for all your eagerness
0	one , which faces north wind , is the one men use
0	they gave me a really tiny portion
0	a desire to lament arose in both of them—
0	or whether we should seek out other men
0	though you are a brave man , god-like achilles , do not encourage achaea 's sons to fightagainst the trojans on empty stomachs
0	but i am ashamed to drive her from the home
0	in all the herds , to serve as dinner for the suitors
0	and hears the sirens ' call never gets back
0	grief overwhelmed the suitors
0	then , odysseus , you will see the other cliff
0	i am no prophet and have no sure skills
0	spoke to him—his words had wings :
0	and the sun get hot
0	then prudent telemachus replied :
0	alas , athena , child of aegis-bearing zeus , tireless one , we have made an empty promise
0	or listen to my words when i asked him
0	we can deal with that
0	if some god made sure our fight was equal , he would not easily defeat me , even thoughhe boasted he 's completely made of bronze
0	but when swift achilles killed my husband , you would not let me weep
0	you have already got men from this country
0	and send you where your heart and spirit urge
0	by the door post of the hall , leaning from her seat to spin fine threads of yarn
0	after saying this , iris left
0	and now all this
0	leaning his chair against a lofty pillar
0	this attempt to scale the heights of heaven is part of the famous stories of the war between the giants and the olympian deities
0	one butchers in its stall
0	until he reached the massive cave , where calypso , the fair-haired nymph , had her home
0	it 's just not fair that you , our leader , have botched things up so badly for us , achaea 's sons
0	you phaeacians counselors and leaders ,
0	which made sorrow come to us as well
0	you dear gods , what a day this is for me !
0	most likely to completely wreck our ship ,
0	approve the act , i myself will kill him
0	trembled as she spoke to him—her words had wings :
0	alcimedon , make sure you keep the horses close to me , so they breathe right on my neck
0	will get this far or throw it further
0	until he would reached the swift ships and the huts—
0	this in your heart—you control the steering on this hollow ship
0	then the sun went down , and all the roads grew dark
0	i groaned and cried out to immortal gods :
0	why try to scare the argives ?
0	then the godlike singer took his hollow lyre
0	that reflection , which lacks imagery and concepts , of the original pain in music , together with its redemption in illusion , gives rise now to a second reflection as the particular metaphor or illustration
0	and after that another proud young man would say :
0	shall i stay there with them , wait for you to come , or hurry back to you , once i have told them your instructions ?
0	listen to me , men of ithaca
0	their eyes filled up with tears
0	from the rocky lookout
0	at once i was the firstto recommend we all appease the god
0	he was coming backfrom oechalia , from the court of eurytus the king
0	he suffered badly , until he came to rhodes , whose people live in three groups split by tribes
0	let 's now imagine that one great cyclops eye of socrates focused on tragedy , that eye in which the beautiful madness of artistic enthusiasm never glowed—let 's imagine how it was impossible for that eye to peer into the dionysian abyss with a feeling of pleasure
0	and sailors ' hearts tell them to go on board
0	that subjectively willing and desiring man archilochus can never ever be a poet
0	saying this , thetis turned away from her own sonto address her ocean sisters :
0	lady , it 's quite impossible to twist another meaning from this dream ,
0	do not we have enough apart from him ,
0	i wish i would got you low down in the gut , taken your life
0	with their excessively garish and motley collection of styles , weaving back and forth between prose and metrical forms , they produced the literary image of raving socrates , which they were in the habit of presenting in their own lives
0	with sponges , clean up the mixing bowls ,
0	we sailed away from there , hearts full of grief at losing loyal companions , though happy
0	but now , i will never welcome him back home again , returning to the house of peleus
0	he prayed to apollo , who loved him well
0	no blame attached itself to you by waiting ,
0	who would just come back from wandering around
0	and their indefatigability makes me think that perhaps they are not aesthetically sensitive at all , but react merely as moral beings when listening to a tragedy
0	euryalus killed dresus and opheltius , then charged after aesepus and pedasus ,
0	was like the gods '
0	his courage will profit no one but himself
0	i have got something to say
0	it 's the interior of zeus ' home
0	behind them , came autolycus ' sons , with lord odysseus
0	once they reached laertes ' well-furnished home , they found
0	each one brought his dead outside the house and buried them
0	now in the twentieth year , after suffering through numerous ordeals ,
0	but proetus , in his heart , plotted against him , driving him from argos , being much stronger , for zeus had given royal power to proetus
0	in the plain , some distance off , a high hill stood by itself , right before the city
0	and returning home , i could hold out here
0	then both sides reinforced their ranks—trojans and lycians , achaeans and myrmidons
0	it 's better to settle this once and for all—whether we live or die—than be hemmed in , fighting a long grim battle , as we are now , among our ships against inferior men
0	but still , though you will suffer badly , you may get home , if you will curb your spirit and your comrades
0	so they set off , led by agamemnon , king of men
0	because he 's now a man , quite capable
0	to accept that , if zeus gave it to me
0	let everyone in troy be slaughtered , without pity , without leaving any trace
0	and zeus ' child , if it 's against your will , you should not now remain here in my house
0	nine heralds shouted out instructions , attempting to control the noise , so men could hear their leaders , god 's chosen ones
0	hearing these words , both men agreed
0	in fact , it could be the case that for the aryan being this myth has the same defining meaning as the myth of the fall has for the semitic peoples , and that both myths are , to some degree , related , as brother and sister
0	was turning over many gloomy thoughts
0	it took us more than seven years
0	as she pursues wild boars and swiftly running deer ,
0	and if they would reached their full-grown height as men ,
0	or with the swineherd
0	one of them would say something like this :
0	then his long sword slaughtered many trojans ,
0	cyclops , if any mortal human being
0	which you now , in your arrogance , display ,
0	but hera , afraid for achilles , cried out , fearing the great , deep , swirling river would sweep him off
0	with these words , he pushed the ram away from him , out through the door
0	othryoneus , of all mortal men i would consider youthe happiest , if you would accomplished all those things you promised dardan priam , so he would give you his daughter
0	resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
0	how else could a people so emotionally sensitive , so spontaneously desiring , so singularly capable of suffering have endured their existence , unless the same qualities manifested themselves in their gods , around whom flowed a higher glory
0	telemachus hangs the servant women from
0	hear me , poseidon , you who enfold the earth—
0	while i was still alive , with no fear of the gods , who hold wide heaven , or of any man
0	but there was no way athena would permit
0	he often served you well—both your city
0	the rest of the danaans hector left alone , not killing any of them
0	just as doves or long-winged thrushes
0	when his own life 's at stake—and we were faced
0	first , with an ointment made from ambrosia she cleaned her lovely face ,
0	then from your thigh , you must yourself draw that sharp sword out , and , sitting there , prevent the powerless heads of those who have died from coming near the blood , until you have listened to teiresias
0	hector led my mind astray with foolish hopes , lots of them
0	it has been pointed out earlier that the homeric epic is the poetry of olympian culture , with which it sang its own song of victory over the terrors of the fight against the titans
0	as he thought about all this , sitting there among the suitors , he saw athena
0	just as black beans or peasfly off a broad shovel on large threshing floors , driven by the sharp wind or winnower 's strength—that 's how the arrow point glanced off the breast plate , then flew aside , away from glorious menelaus
0	his arms and legs she covered with an old man 's ancient flesh and dimmed his eyes , which had been so beautiful before
0	so they could eat meat to their heart 's content
0	back from athens—bad news for aegisthus
0	the noise never stops
0	brave diomedes , skilled at war cries , noticed this
0	shrewd telemachus then said in reply :
0	when i relied upon my youth and strength , i think i ranked among the very best
0	for he , too , i think , is dressed in rags like these ,
0	he will give you clothes himself , a cloak and tunic , and send you where your heart desires to go
0	your voyage here quite useless
0	that was just talk
0	if ares had come there , he would have approved of them , as would athena , who inspires men in war
0	in lovely thebes , ruling the cadmeans
0	daughter of great zeus and hera , goddess
0	resourceful odysseus answered him and said :
0	in order to get closer to these two instinctual drives , let us think of them next as the separate artistic worlds of dreams and of intoxication , physiological phenomena between which we can observe an opposition corresponding to the one between the apollonian and the dionysian
0	against her wishes , to give an order
0	the fair goddess calypso
0	given freely from her stores
0	but at least hector , priam 's son , wo not mount youor drive your finely decorated chariot
0	get up , old woman ,
0	to the high-roofed chamber which stored his father 's wealth , an extensive place
0	she stepped high up , onto the planking where the storage trunks were placed in which they kept their fragrant clothing
0	do not look in on anyone or ask questions
0	close to the gates , they met priam bringing home the body
0	and so through their depravity they have met an evil fate
0	in argos , but i sailed on to pylos
0	in earlier days , young men would take the dog to hunt wild goats , deer , and rabbits ,
0	ajax struck through the even circle of the shield of his opponent , but did not touch his flesh
0	left him and went to troy , you would quickly see
0	keep her distance and question her dear husband , or should she come up to him , hold his head and hands , and kiss them ?
0	but tell me truly how you chanced to see him
0	his words had wings
0	across from him stands idomeneus , surrounded by his cretans , like a god
0	as he sat there beside him , was the only one
0	alcinous , you should not concern yourself
0	with the lyre he was bringing pleasure to his heart , singing about the celebrated deeds of men
0	there was a radiance , as if from sun or moon
0	and the hearth of excellent odysseus ,
0	tell you something or keep it to myself ?
0	a large crowd stood around , enjoying the dancing magic , as in the middle two acrobats led on the dance , springing , and whirling , and tumbling
0	do not permit them to come into my presence
0	there has never been another period in the history of art in which so-called culture and true art have been so estranged and opposed as we may observe them to be at present
0	all the finest of phaeacians
0	he stabbed elephenor with his bronze spear , right in his exposed side , where his shield left himvulnerable as he bent down
0	counselor zeus has made manifest to us
0	son of atreus , you other argive leaders , many long-haired achaeans have been killed
0	there is one leader held back by the sea somewhere , but still alive
0	but come now , tell me—and make sure you speak the truth—
0	and now some men are setting out to kill
0	even now this metaphysical drive still tries to create for itself a certainly attenuated form of transfiguration , in the socratism of science that strives for life ; but on the lower steps , this same drive led only to a feverish search that gradually lost itself in a pandemonium of myths and superstitions that were collected from all over and piled up in confusion : nevertheless the greek sat among them with an unstilled heart until he learned to mask this fever with greek cheerfulness and greek frivolity , becoming a graeculus [ a contemptuous term for a greek
0	thanks to what the gods then willed , for we know everything that happens on this fertile earth
0	then heat a cauldron for him on the fire ,
0	about his straight-horned cattle and desires to wreck our ship and other gods agree ,
0	mother , i had to come down here to hades ' home ,
0	quite an impish boy—when we are outside
0	by father zeus , athena , and apollo , would i were as young as when the pylianand arcadian spearmen gathered to fightby the walls of pheia , beside the banksof the fast-flowing river celadon
0	or ask questions , or look directly at him
0	when he reached his comrades , he turned around and stood his ground once more
0	the son of cronos spoke , then nodded his dark brow
0	some god was planning trouble
0	and shoots an arrow through all twelve axes
0	lord of the dark cloud , ruler of all ,
0	once the surf had taken layers of sweat from off their skin and their hearts had been refreshed , they stepped in shining tubs and bathed
0	sweeter than honey the words flowed from his tongue
0	and we consider this problem too profound to be touched by such superficial styles of commentary
0	he 's in a bad way now
0	did not allow the raft to carry me ,
0	the spirit in my crew was shattered
0	their father present , all the gods at once stood up from their seats
0	some report of your dear father
0	that 's what he prayed
0	laodamas , what you have just said is really sensible
0	to my own land , when you had given me
0	telemachus , your heart will think of something , and power from heaven will provide the rest
0	do not whine to me , you dog , about my kneesor parents
0	did not forget his skillful tricks
0	the rage of zeus , the god of strangers ,
0	but my own work must not be wasted , worth nothing
0	saying this , ajax tried a lift
0	is prompting me to state
0	but i ca not see any argive who could do that
0	traced out by someone very skilled in carpentry
0	when she spewed it out , she seethed and bubbled
0	lord alcinous , most renowned of men ,
0	no one else was allowed to sit there with them , no old or younger men
0	you suitors , make sure your hearts do not encourage you
0	as for men on the estates , i would prefer
0	bearing all sorts of different types of grapes ,
0	you would not utter prophecies like these
0	he was sitting there
0	but not even horse-taming hyperenor , strong as he was , got much enjoymentfrom his youthful vigour , once he would mocked me , as he waited when i came against him , calling me the most unworthy warrioramong danaans
0	now , as for you ,
0	thinking of patroclus , he sighed repeatedly , then said :
0	the purple cloak covering his back , jumped up ,
0	bright-eyed goddess athena answered hera :
0	men threw these logs down in a line along the shore , where achilles planned a massive burial mound for patroclus and himself
0	diomedes pulled up right in the middle of the crowd
0	and how could we avoid
0	but then telemachus , leaning his head over
0	yesterday , my twentieth day afloat ,
0	to hyperesia , where he lived and prophesied
0	i do not like you or care about your rage
0	i will see—and in my heart confirm—if he will return , as he 's just done , or if life-giving earth , which keeps even strong men down , will hold him
0	friends , what our wise queen has just said to us , as we would expect , is not wide of the mark
0	in return , music imparts to the tragic myth an intense and convincing metaphysical significance that word an image without this singular help could never have attained
0	and i am good enough to sing before you ,
0	the clearest figure still always had a comet 's tail attached to it , which seemed to hint at the unknown , the inexplicable
0	it 's better to be frank
0	then she knew me
0	i will send you off with honour
0	but if our feelings were those of entirely dionysian beings , myth as a symbol would remain totally ineffective and unnoticed , and would never for a moment keep us from listening to the re-echo of the universalia ante rem [ the universals before the thing ]
0	just at sunset , they reached the celebrated grove , sacred to athena
0	i washed it clean
0	then lash boards against his back
0	wherever you run into foreigners
0	with me in overall command , telling men
0	while she was doing laundry , one of them
0	now , let 's go straight for him
0	will not be useless , even though i travel
0	i might have seen
0	here that dreadful witches ' potion of lust and cruelty was without power
0	my dear child , i am giving you this gift as a reminder
0	indeed , my son , you have made a valid point
0	these he will present to you , with them the one he seized from you , briseis , daughter of briseus
0	by contrast , the sound painting of the new dithyramb immediately strips such a vivid event of its mythic character
0	in the likeness of a man , noted where it fell
0	and she revealed no lack of noble sense ,
0	hanging on my sturdy thigh and striking him , slicing off his head and knocking it to earth ,
0	but since you have only learned to misbehave ,
0	the sacred gods , afraid , stopped tying up zeus
0	for i can claimi do not neglect my fighting prowess
0	we had our food and drink ,
0	and he will get great sorrow , if achaeans are wiped out
0	meanwhile , the other men had finished working
0	you would prefer to beg throughout the land ,
0	let diomedes take the first-place prize
0	some argive has got it in his flesh
0	at once she spoke up accusingly :
0	with these words , achilles set off towards the city , his heart full , charging on like a prize-winning horse pulling a chariot at full speed across the plain with little effort—that 's how fast achilles ran , sprinting with his legs and feet
0	were eager to get up and charge outside
0	hit a man—eurydamas—while telemachus
0	to leave the horse , and he kept reaching for his sword hilt and his spear of heavy bronze
0	then you can rouse yourselves and come with me ,
0	fair-cheeked helen , standing beside him with the garment in her hands , spoke to telemachus and said :
0	but aegis-bearing zeus , son of cronos , keeps showering me with grievous troubles
0	so i will go
0	where now has the myth-building spirit of music gone ?
0	loyal servants stood with her , one on either side
0	that he would experience hardships on his trip
0	he ate and drank voraciously—many days had passed since he would last tasted food
0	carry it back here
0	my girls , give the stranger food and drink
0	it never once let up
0	i was alone , for zeus had struck my ship
0	you could not tell whether sun and moon still shone , for in that fighta mist surrounded all the best men standing there
0	going off on the run , menelaus came up to ajax , then spoke out :
0	you are the first one i have approached , after going through so much grief
0	that 's the reasoni will never stop this grieving for your death
0	with wild and dangerous men restraining him ,
0	to become the king of fertile ithaca ,
0	then eurymachus , son of polybus , answered her :
0	it happened that a thesprotian ship
0	with his flesh shriveling around his bones
0	then mighty agamemnon sent out men and mules , from huts in every quarter , to gather wood
0	deïphobus was of two minds— should he step back and pick out a companion from stout-hearted trojans , or should he try to fight all on his own ?
0	i ca not see all that clearly , but the man seems to be of aetolian descent , an argive king , mighty diomedes , son of horse-taming tydeus
0	rouse yourself , son of peleus , most feared of men
0	of all danaans after the noble son
0	here 's a fearful honoured goddess in my home , the one who saved me when i was in pain , after my great fall , thanks to my mother , that shameless one , eager to conceal me , because i was a cripple
0	where are his family , his paternal lands ?
0	still , we are sorry for the troops , danaan spearmen dying , suffering dreadful fates
0	he did not stay to let himself get known
0	his words stirred the heart in aeneas ' chest
0	the spear point smashed through the helmet with its horsehair crest , driven on by the force of ajax 's mighty fists in that huge spear
0	the torch light emanates from his own head
0	then drive the lambs and kids out of their pens
0	gouneus brought twenty-two ships from cyphus
0	when sleep fell down across their eyelids , the suitors felt an urge not to stay sitting there for any length of time , but to get themselves some rest down in the city
0	that bow of his
0	he 's tall and handsome !
0	i notice many men are feasting here—
0	pelias and neleus , and they became
0	the man is no longer an artist
0	men rushed to arm themselves
0	there 's any way he could get here on foot
0	hector saw this from the lines
0	man , rising up into something titanic , is victorious over his own culture and compels the gods to unite with him , because in his self-controlled wisdom he holds their existence and the limits to their authority in his hand
0	has granted him the power to understand—
0	we two come from the gods , here to help you—me and pallas athena , and zeus approves
0	to pour down on the flaming sacrifice ,
0	but i will tell these things to thunder-loving zeus
0	other people will not recognize them
0	but zeus wants us to winfar more than the danaans , and you all suffercountless fears and wo not keep battling on
0	with a man who came from somewhere else ,
0	then the housekeeper invited him to step
0	to reach old age among his own possessions ,
0	the surging sea parted round the two of them
0	i will have to wander round the city by myself ,
0	with horses and a well-built chariot
0	he would be quick to blame an innocent man
0	then on noble hector 's corpse he carried out a monstrous act
0	first , with ambrosiashe washed from her lovely body all the stains , then rubbed her skin with fragrant oil , divinely sweet , made specially for her
0	she set off , going to divine odysseus ' home
0	fourth was polyxeinus , son of agasthenes , augeas ' son
0	to my mind , this last place is the onewhere long-haired achaeans stand most in need
0	moves back and forth in its uncertainty
0	and trusting their own might , at once began
0	next , achilles set out the prizes for the archers , things made of blackened iron—ten double axes and ten with single blades
0	as you instruct me
0	a friend 's persuasion is an excellent thing
0	to move in ithaca , not in the city
0	she traced it out and recognized it
0	he was wondering whether he should charge and kill him with his staff ,
0	i am a friend
0	i marched here as an ally , traveling far , for lycia is a long , long way from here , by the swirling river xanthus , where i leftmy dear wife , my infant son , much property , something poor men covet
0	daughter of aegis-bearing zeus , set a rock in place to block the entranceway
0	where menelaus and his ships then sailed
0	come now , let 's ask some prophet , priest , interpreter of dreams—for dreams , too , come from zeus—a man who might say why apollo is so angry , whether he faults our prayers and offerings , whether somehow he will welcome sacrificial smokefrom perfect lambs and goats , then rouse himself and release us from this plague
0	with forestays they soon set the mast down in its notch , then rowed the ship in to its mooring place
0	each man sent a herald out to fetch some gifts
0	polyphemus , what 's so bad with you that you keep shouting through the immortal night and wake us up ?
0	i shall speak only of the most illustrious opposition to the tragic world view : by that i mean research scholarship , optimistic to the core of its being , with its father socrates perched on the pinnacle
0	our sacrificial victims , while i unsheathed
0	the cyclops , in his frantic rage , devoured
0	used up his goods , and victimized his son
0	will soon be here
0	whether they are cruel , unjust , and savage ,
0	i would like to know that
0	how then among all these immortal gods
0	i have sent antilochus to our fast ships , to swift achilles
0	and we live far off in the surging sea ,
0	inside a hollow cave , a place nymphs used
0	i have got a mind that 's not made for a fool
0	and it will happen
0	but now they are fightingwell outside the city , by our hollow ships
0	then nestor , standing up before the argives , said :
0	made of eternal bronze and gleaming like a star , it stood out among the homes of the immortals
0	telemachus , once i have gone up to my room ,
0	you will have a bed
0	fearful night envelops wretched mortals
0	i always remember with such yearning
0	diomedes woke up quickly , then answered him—his words had wings :
0	after our flesh and blood ?
0	and weave a robe , wide and delicate fabric
0	odysseus left the harbour , taking the rough path into the woods and across the hills , to the place where athena told him he would meet the swineherd , who was , of all the servants lord odysseus had ,
0	he is close by
0	she sat there a long time in silence
0	at this moment , men are constantly in action by our ships , with no relief
0	and set it down before them , then lots of meat ,
0	they know that themselves , more so than anyone
0	to die than live and fail in the attempt
0	he came to see
0	wished to get back to their hollow ship
0	some arrogant young man would make a comment using words like these :
0	in some land far away
0	for fate ordainsthat he will escape , so the dardanian racewill not die out and leave no seed alive
0	but earthshaker poseidon is a stubborn god ,
0	the son of menoetius , godlike man , stoked the fire , a huge one
0	where aeolus lived , son of hippotas ,
0	and you ’ ve thrown us all into disaster
0	for when music seeks only to arouse our indulgence by compelling us to find external analogies between an event in life or nature and certain rhythmic figures and characteristic musical sounds , when our understanding is supposed to be satisfied with the recognition of these analogies , then we are dragged down into a mood in which a conception of the mythic is impossible
0	and rose-fingered early dawn
0	but the ox-hide backstay
0	aboard swift ships to be escorted back by sailors
0	fleeing his country and great-hearted neleus ,
0	lord zeus , grant i may be revenged on this man , who first committed crimes against me , lord alexander
0	to glorify or else debase a man
0	father zeus and you other blessed gods
0	as your own husband , who will execute
0	a bad or feeble man , if gods follow you
0	daughter of great-hearted alcinous
0	nurse , come and help me
0	raise that long spear of yours and throw it
0	throughout all greece and middle argos
0	and say i swim in tears because my mind
0	we went ashore and carried water back
0	she placed it facing paris
0	and not conceal a thing
0	at dawn , we shall consider whether to go back
0	agamemnon , king of men , replied :
0	but what may art itself expect form the operation of an art form whose beginnings lie entirely outside of the aesthetic province and which has stolen over from a half-moral sphere into the artistic domain , deceiving us only occasionally about its hybrid origin ?
0	in case the noise the suitors made disturbed the guest and made him hate the meal because he would had to share the company of overbearing men
0	the guts came with it
0	to guard the palace of great-hearted alcinous
0	will be my lot , now that i have been cursed ,
0	and the hearth of excellent odysseus ,
0	telamonian ajax still gripped the spear , but it was useless without its bronze spear head , which fell some distance off , clanging on the ground
0	she put in delicacies , as well , and poured some wine into a goat skin
0	as many lovely presents as befit
0	lying on the couch , all her limbs relaxed
0	tlepolemus ' long spear struck sarpedon in his left thigh
0	was even angrier than before
0	just as an industrious and honest woman holds her scales , a weight on one side , wool on the other , until they balance , so she can glean a pittance for her children , that 's how evenly the battle raged , until zeus gave glory above all other men to hector , son of priam , who was the first man to jump inside that wall of the achaeans
0	as menelaus said these words , he sprang forward , grabbing the horse hair crest on paris ' helmet , twisting him around
0	odysseus struck molion , godlike attendant to lord thymbraeus
0	eat now , stranger , what a servant offers ,
0	were sailing off to troy , i prophesied
0	from zacynthus twenty young achaeans ,
0	there was no way athena would allow the suitors , those arrogant men , to stop behaving badly ,
0	but now , far from their city , they fight here , right by our hollow ships
0	or offered such well-chosen sacrifice
0	but come now , let 's make
0	before we designate this other spectator by name , let 's linger here a moment to reconsider that characteristic duality and incommensurability at the heart of aeschylean tragedy ( something we described earlier )
0	leaving the bodies there , he charged into the line where soldiers ' ranks were most confused ,
0	in the shape of acamas , thracian leader , he yelled at priam 's royal sons :
0	surely you are not tiredfrom those fights where men win glory , exhausted after killing off the trojans , for whom you feel such deadly hatred ?
0	and to begin with ,
0	set it lengthwise on the deck of the curved ship ,
0	the axe makes his force stronger
0	many labourers were wheeling ploughs across it , moving back and forth
0	still , of all mortal men in ilion , hector was the favourite of the gods
0	without a care they waste our property
0	what his dear father said
0	bring a boar in here , the best there is , so i can butcher it
0	my lovely ram , why are you the last one in the flock
0	before he could succeed in stringing up the bow
0	he quickly came to troy and to the hellespont
0	in front of them , hector 's horses , swift of foot , came out to fight
0	he picked out twenty men , the best there were in the whole state , and set up an ambush
0	zeus told me to come here against my will
0	to get back to our swift ship by the shore ,
0	was it so you would experience sorrowamong unhappy men ?
0	but for us to make use of plato 's terminology , we would have to talk of the tragic figures of the greek stage in something like the following terms : the one truly real dionysus appears in a multiplicity of shapes , in the mask of a struggling hero and , as it were , bound up in the nets of the individual will
0	but we are not going back to our own lands ,
0	the young men , after tying up their clothes ,
0	for if we come to blows , then we will have trouble
0	the famous earthshaker , enraged , replied :
0	those known for their great bravery did not back off
0	when agamemnon , king of men , heard these words , he quickly sent the troops off to their balanced ships
0	you will be laughing at the troubles still in store
0	the two of you were busy with the ox meat
0	his mind was not too clever—
0	he could keep grim death at bay
0	or else some achaean man will grab your armand throw you from the wall—a dreadful death—in his anger that hector killed his brother , or his father , or his son
0	meriones , with quick strides , caught up with acamas , then hit him with his spearin his right shoulder , as he was climbing in his chariot
0	falling on her knees , she implored her dear brother , pleading hard for his golden-bridled horses :
0	will deny my will by force , if i wish
0	trojans , lycians , dardan spearmen , be men , my friends , call on your fighting strength
0	who is especially irked at wicked deeds
0	moving down from heaven , looking like a woman
0	it 's skill that lets a helmsman steer his course , guiding his swift ship straight on wine-dark seas
0	of all his sons
0	i will fetch you clothing , a cloak and tunic ,
0	the sea surged up to the achaean huts and ships , as the two sides met with a tremendous noise , louder than ocean surf booming on shore , driven there from the depths by the harsh north wind , louder , too , than roaring fire as it jumps to burn the trees in some mountain clearing , louder than the wind which howls through the highest branches of some oak tree , a wind which at its worst makes the most piercing noise— that 's how loud the shouting came from trojans and achaeans ,
0	so i could get the gifts he would promised me ,
0	up to wide heaven
0	as if he were divine , then send him off ,
0	in it a servant woman
0	he quickly bent his bow , taking aim at diomedes
0	apollo could not live without dionysus !
0	but as soon as the genius of music flew away from tragedy , tragedy is , in the strong sense of the term , dead
0	and placed it in his hands
0	in such a furious temper , so that he
0	but the spear did not break through
0	to take the bow in its bright case down from its peg
0	i will be grateful always
0	and if , among philosophers , anaxagoras , with his concept of mind , seems to be the first sober man among total drunkards , so euripides might have conceptualized his relationship to the other poets with a similar image
0	desperately eager to destroy this place , they pitched their forces round it in a siege
0	with shields and two-edged spears
0	at that point , trojans , like some fire or windstorm , marched behind hector , son of priam , in a mass , shouting and screaming with excitement , hoping to seize achaean ships and kill the best men there
0	that tale , whose fame had climbed to spacious heaven , about odysseus and achilles , son of peleus ,
0	who are your parents ?
0	snatched two of my men and gorged himself
0	and here we see that the entire conception of the poet is nothing other than that illuminated image which nature as healer holds up before us after a glimpse into the abyss
0	they are beautiful and made just recently , but covered up with drapes
0	they ran fast , for this was no contest over sacrificial beasts , the usual prizes for a race
0	every trojan woman would revile me afterwards
0	come now , phaeacian counselor and leader ,
0	as yours to keep , all the food and wine ,
0	but all the other ships ,
0	far out in front
0	if all the argives in iasian argos
0	warming it here and there in the firelight
0	what can the healing magic of apollo not accomplish when it can even create the illusion that the dionysian is really in the service of the apollinian and capable of enhancing its effects -- as if music were essentially the art of presenting an apollinian content ?
0	odysseus , how is it you have come back here ?
0	i was not speaking all that seriously
0	go through with it
0	right now i am filthy ,
0	saying this , he pulled his bronze spear from the river bank
0	the finest clay , the most expensive marble—man—is here worked and chiseled , and the cry of the eleusianian mysteries rings out to the chisel blows of the dionysian world artist : do you fall down , you millions ?
0	aeneas , anchises ' worthy son , led the dardanians
0	are you trading men , or wandering the sea
0	having objects thrown at me or being hit
0	mesthles and antiphus commanded the maeonians
0	the spear of pelian ash drove straight through the shield , which rattled from the blow
0	pre-eminent among the tribes of men
0	and odysseus fathered me , his only son ,
0	not thinking i would feel the cold without it ,
0	the old man , godlike priam , then said in response to hecuba :
0	and planning brave odysseus ' journey home
0	well , he may be killed anyway—some godmay strike him
0	carry out your work— this butchery—out there on the plain
0	old godlike priam then answered achilles :
0	from fallen leaves scattered on the ground
0	i slung my large bronze silver-studded sword
0	or else in the sea the fish
0	you will see the suitors killed , if that 's your wish ,
0	for when the lethal fate of his sad death will seize him , so no achaean woman
0	different women , any one of whom might be suitable for us to marry
0	but he keeps control
0	he had two sons—phegeusand idaios—both very skilled in all aspects of war
0	to spacious lacedaemon , to the home
0	as he was coming home , back from the fields ,
0	seeing their advance , menestheus , son of peteos , shuddered , for they were aiming at his part of the wall , bringing destruction with them
0	and told him he should send me on my way ,
0	let all keep a sharp lookout , to stop a group from entering our citywhile the army is elsewhere
0	at that point i forgot
0	and does her weaving in an upper room
0	in some foreign land , and careless women
0	to anyone i wish or to withhold it—
0	agamemnon sent talthybius to the hollow ships , instructing him to bring a sacrificial lamb
0	just as a man sets a layer of gold on silver ,
0	the two put on their armour , closed the shining door , and made their way to wise and crafty odysseus
0	let 's give him gifts of friendship , as is right
0	another need was driving us away
0	on top of silver , a craftsman who 's been taught
0	will have to trust your heart
0	and meet the suitors with the strength he had
0	who competed with the gods in archery
0	moving around everywhere , he began the killing
0	i will not marry her
0	i was the only one
0	and do not lag behind
0	he sat on the highest part of mount olympus , under golden clouds , confined by zeus ' will , along with the rest of the immortal gods , forbidden to participate in warfare
0	that 's how my mother is ,
0	and may he find troubles in his house
0	he will scratch his shoulders on many doorposts ,
0	be gracious and give me a noble fame ,
0	you would get good prices there
0	but at that time , thetis said nothing of the evil which had taken place , the death of his companion , his dearest friend by far
0	he swam on ahead , eager
0	with this voyage of his , has now achieved
0	achaeans felt keen sorrow that such a worthy man had fallen
0	for the true poet , metaphor is not a rhetorical trope , but a representative image which really hovers in front of him in the place of an idea
0	i suffered many troubles and allowed
0	teasing achaea 's sons because in her heart
0	when he comes back home
0	a marriage she detested , nor did she
0	she 's still living in her home , as before—
0	if your man kills me with his sharpened bronze , let him strip my armour , take it away , off to your hollow ships , but give my body back to my house , so trojans and their wives
0	i want the truth , so i know what happened—
0	and two ox-hide shields , for the two of us
0	leading on another filthy scoundrel
0	has freely given him these presents
0	odysseus and his men
0	leave that sort of boasting to the gods ,
0	it 's good to extend one 's hand to zeus , if he 's inclined to pity
0	in this house , when you allow a stranger
0	even so , let me not die ingloriouslywithout a fight , but in some great actionwhich those men yet to come will hear about
0	then antinous , eupeithes ' son , addressed them :
0	back when the achaeans ,
0	if now the entire crowd philosophized , administered their lands and goods with tremendous astuteness , and carried on their own legal matters , well then , he claimed , that was to his credit and the achievement of the wisdom which he had drummed into the people
0	that wise odysseus would return back home ,
0	what will happen to our agreements , the oaths we made ?
0	on his shoulder he looped his bronze , silver-studded sword , his huge strong shield
0	long-suffering lord odysseus heard what she advised
0	tyro conceived and then gave birth to sons ,
0	clytoneus was by far the finest runner ,
0	she came out at once , opened the bright doors ,
0	feeling that hollow trap
0	the first contingent was led by menesthius , with his flashing breastplate , son of spercheius , the river fed from heaven
0	but alcinous rested in an inner chamber in the high-roofed house—his lady wife lay there , as well ,
0	the fact that in general there can be a connection between a musical composition and a perceptible presentation rests on the point that , as stated , both are only very different expressions of same inner essence of the world
0	alcinous made her his wife and honoured her
0	but the servants girded up his clothes and led him up
0	i lay down on the deck , while our ships ,
0	her force broke the ox-hide strap , leaving menelaus clutching in his massive hands an empty helmet
0	there she met the suitors , those arrogant men , who were enjoying themselves
0	go to the room upstairs , and promise
0	he would boasted his singing would surpass the muses , daughters of aegis-bearing zeus , should they compete
0	the son of cronos has made our family
0	he was digging round a plant , all by himself ,
0	eumaeus covered him with a huge thick cloak ,
0	there they face an imminent destruction
0	far away from us , beside achaean ships , their swift dogs will eat you
0	the phantom passed through the thong which held the bolt and went into penelope 's room
0	though i was dying , i raised my arms to strike her with my sword , but that dog-faced bitch turned her back on me
0	they ripped away my clothes , cloak and tunic ,
0	but that fearful goddess with a human voice ,
0	but when antilochus stood by menelaus , aeneas , though a swift fighter , started to withdraw , seeing these two men standing their ground together
0	meanwhile , achaeans were moving to the walls , their shields held up against their shoulders
0	hephaestus then prepared a prodigious blaze
0	but in my heart i had no appetite
0	so i will return home now to phthia
0	there , before the gates , they sat down
0	as someone capable of picking up
0	on their trip across the water , minds fully bent on slaughtering telemachus
0	in his right hand , he gripped a stone , a large jagged rock , his fingers wrapped around it
0	as wise as you or more welcome—your words
0	i know you well
0	he quickly shut the lid and bound it with a knot , a tricky one which he would picked up from queenly circe
0	to make it hot , and spoke to all my men ,
0	to see when his hands would fight the shameless suitors
0	he snapped off a huge chunk of mountain rock
0	know that i am earthshaker poseidon
0	and told my loyal comrades to stay there
0	other long-haired achaeans drink their portion , the amount allotted to them , but your cupalways stands full of wine , as does mine , so you can drink any time your heart desires
0	every struggle of the spirit of music for pictorial and mythic revelation , which becomes increasingly intense from the beginning of the lyric right up to attic tragedy , suddenly breaks apart , right after developing in full luxuriant bloom , and , so to speak , disappears from the surface of hellenic art , although the dionysian world view born out of this struggle lives on in the mysteries and in its most amazing transformations and degeneration never stops attracting serious natures to it
0	beside the shore , glowing with charm and beauty
0	charged at me—their anger was so great ,
0	that 's what i was like
0	even in the language of the old tragedies there was a great deal he found offensive or , at least , enigmatic
0	everything they did and suffered , the work
0	but thoas could not stripthe armour off
0	that 's how they talked
0	placed ambrosia and nectar right beside her
0	why do we possess so much fine property , by the river xanthus , beside its banks , rich vineyards and wheat-bearing ploughland ?
0	i saw alcmene , amphitryon 's wife ,
0	from laments , as i look after my own work
0	you will see your friends and make that journey back to your own high-roofed home and native land
0	everything is interwoven in the cloth
0	so many harsh ordeals
0	cloud-gatherer zeus answered him and said :
0	have changed all that completely
0	he would brace his arms and feet ,
0	apollo did not disobey his father
0	although i often sit here in my house
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	but come , let 's get our two minds workingto rouse our spirits for this coming fight
0	are all mixed up
0	for above all mortal men , odysseus
0	all his companions , leaving only two
0	then i replied and said :
0	for a different man
0	what if it were the case that the greeks , right in the midst of their rich youth , had the desire for tragedy and were pessimists ? what if it was clearly lunacy , to use a saying from plato , which brought the greatest blessings throughout hellas ?
0	for i wo not go in there alone
0	let zeus himself , hera 's loud-thundering husband ,
0	raw meat for them rip to pieces
0	argives also moved swiftly from their well-decked ships
0	the old man , in a hurry , climbed in his chariot , then drove out through the gate and echoing courtyard
0	each soldier 's appetite was fully satisfied— all dined equally
0	he 's put some good—you have undergone much pain ,
0	with this mirror of beauty , the hellenic will fought against the talent for suffering and the wisdom of suffering which is bound up with artistic talent , and as a memorial of its victory homer , the naïve artist , stands before us
0	he said these words to ease her mood , while he himself was planning her son 's death
0	they set off for the centre of that noisy battle , with cebriones , noble polydamas , phalces , orthaeus , godlike polyphetes , palmys , ascanius , morus , son of hippotion , men who would come from fertile ascania the day before as reinforcements
0	i had seven brothers in my home
0	tying the twisted sheep 's gut down at either end—
0	urging them on , so no one , in his fear ,
0	or some place else , not until she marries
0	here in the house , exactly as i said
0	you wo not escape from him
0	without paying anything , i will call upon
0	where , my lord , i ask you to remember me
0	the gates were being demolished
0	he answered me at once :
0	who , when i was still a boy , put me in charge
0	then agamemnon prayed on their behalf :
0	or restrain their hands from acting badly
0	in hope you would pity me and send me off
0	for this reason the dithyramb is essentially different from every other choral song
0	but i will have no part of escorting him
0	you have no cause to grieve because you are dead
0	euripides is a pure artist neither in planning his work nor in carrying it out
0	or bringing back the rest of your companions
0	in delos once i saw something like this—
0	he would already brought men lots of trouble
0	who 's watching over and protecting you
0	diomedes charged off , joining at once those soldiers fighting in the front , his spirit on fire to battle trojans , seized by frenzy three times greater than before
0	my kingship , or has another man already
0	he covered his broad back with a spotted leopard skin , picked up his bronze helmet , set it on his head , then picked a spear up in his powerful fist
0	but he could not sway hector 's heart
0	of the fertile mainland reaching out to sea ?
0	will rule sea-girt ithaca
0	one by one , relaxed me with their soothing words :
0	by far of the achaeans , i came here
0	would have lamented him , the one who planned
0	and carrying a freight of shining iron
0	a solemn oath that you will make no more plans to injure me with some new mischief
0	peirous , who would thrown the rock , ran up and speared his gut
0	a man stooped with age , but infinitely wise
0	they shared no words—they had no common language , but mixtures of tongues , with men from many lands
0	would have tossed me up onshore , throwing me
0	with him were antenor 's two sons , archelochus and acamas , extremely skilled in every form of war
0	that 's how they talked
0	posing a threat to men from other lands ?
0	to carry out what he would proposed
0	then they drank wine to their heart 's content and left , each to his own home , to get some sleep
0	my brother , swift achilles is really harassing you , with his fast running around priam 's cityin this pursuit
0	may set some monstrous creature of the sea
0	not till i would touched all my master 's body
0	the prophet calchas , understanding all , told us apollo 's will
0	the gods were sitting in assembly , among them
0	who were allied with us
0	death , who destroys men 's hearts , flowed all around patroclus , as he slaughtered erymas , amphoterus , epaltes , tlepolemus , son of damastor , echius , pyris , ipheus , euippus , and polymelus , son of argeas—all these patroclus laid out , one by one , on the earth , which nourishes all men
0	the best known connection , however , is the close juxtaposition of both names in the oracular pronouncements of the delphic oracle , which indicated that socrates was the wisest of men and at the same time delivered the judgment that euripides captured second prize in the contest for wisdom
0	she stood above his head and spoke to him , saying :
0	happy to have avoided being destroyed ,
0	survived , for queen hera rescued him
0	with such an open heart
0	but as the months and seasons came and went ,
0	and fine hospitality—that 's the right
0	but you should have a bath ,
0	however , once we look away from the character of the hero as it surfaces and becomes perceptible ( a character which is basically nothing more than a light picture cast onto a dark wall , that is , an illusion through and through ) we penetrate further into the myth which projects itself in this bright reflection
0	many of his men , armed with their ash spears ,
0	armed in bronze , only two leading warriors were killed on their way home
0	so you must go and say that to your son
0	here is the house you asked me to point out
0	he was in great distress , but , caked with brine , he was a fearful sight to them ,
0	achilles had laid waste lyrnessus and thebe 's walls , overthrown the spearmen mynes and epistrophus , sons of lord euenus , son of king selepius because of her , achilles sat still grieving
0	he 's been king , they say ,
0	so , stranger , pay attention to what i say ,
0	then the famous crippled god came back to them—
0	then how he came to aeolus , who would taken him in
0	i do not thinka trojan who gets within my spear rangewill have reason to feel happy
0	when godlike alexander saw menelaus there , among the fighters at the front , his heart sank
0	nevertheless i can assert ( something of a paradox to all appearances ) on the basis of the secret foundation of our essence , whose manifestation we are , precisely the opposite evaluation of dreams
0	i will not conceal it from you
0	with a long speech
0	royal and mighty alcinous rose from his bed ,
0	that statement of socrates 's dream vision is the single indication of his thinking about something perhaps beyond the borders of his logical nature
0	all right , my child , i will tell you the truth
0	now , come along with me ,
0	you have five dear sons living in your home—
0	embraced laertes , kissed him , and then said :
0	so now , since i am not returning to my own dear land , and for patroclus was no saving lightor for my many other comrades , all those killed by godlike hector while i sathere by the ships , a useless burdenon the earth—and i am unmatched in warfareby any other achaean armed in bronze , although in council other men are better—so let wars disappear from gods and menand passionate anger , too , which inciteseven the prudent man to that sweet rage , sweeter than trickling honey in men 's throats , which builds up like smoke inside their chests , as agamemnon , king of men , just now , made me enraged
0	she reached up to odysseus ' chin and said :
0	should deny me this
0	my friends , be patient , give us all more time , until calchas ' prophecy comes true or not
0	i have the finest ships and young men , too ,
0	during the summer months and in fruitful autumn , he makes his bed
0	together in a group , eupeithes rose to speak
0	was menelaus not in achaean argos ,
0	better men with stronger hands than hishave already been destroyed and will be
0	some low-born achaean said something like :
0	hermes the guide , killer of argus , then replied :
0	after i would put on
0	he came , stood in their midst , and delivered his report
0	the lance of knowledge turns itself against the wise man
0	troubles have fallen in a double sense
0	and these are the horseswhich dolon told us of , the man we killed
0	and lord odysseus left with them
0	they all ate and drank to their full heart 's content
0	as i drew closer to our curving ship ,
0	the fact that tragedy begins with him , that out of him the dionysian wisdom of tragedy speaks , is a phenomenon as foreign to us here as the development of tragedy out of the chorus generally
0	who can endure much suffering
0	are empty of all grace
0	now the music has become a feeble copy of a phenomenon and , in the process , infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself
0	such a man also understandshow to urge his horses on , right at the start , using leather reins
0	every pain you have suffered on the fish-filled seas , every wrong that hostile men have done on land
0	there in the cave—we did not have the strength
0	and the goddess would set before them very soon
0	he said he would seen odysseus with cretans
0	always thinking gentle thoughts about his master
0	odysseus stripped away the clothing he would received from fair calypso
0	so then i pushed the stake deep in the ashes ,
0	the music of apollo was doric architecture expressed in sound , but only in intimate tones , characteristic of the cithara [ a traditional stringed instrument }
0	after odysseus spoke , the two men went away ,
0	his spirit swiftly left his limbs , and he was carried off by hateful darkness
0	with no one else
0	a garden vine , fully ripe
0	three comrades , the ones i trusted most in any enterprise
0	i pursued , going after them like some black whirlwind
0	but i have no reports
0	athena guided it straight to pandarus ' nose , directly by the eyes
0	because he begged you to ?
0	all those lords with power in the islands—
0	that was a foolish thought !
0	repeatedly , i urged you not to do it
0	may gods grant you success !
0	by huge extensive roots—just like that , these two men , trusting the power in their arms , held their position , as great asius approached
0	the gods brought him up just like a sapling ,
0	he will run into troubles with those people
0	he 's strong , powerful enough to throw this far
0	joy in his heart
0	for some time they soared
0	my heart has often felt a strong desire to take a woman there as my own wife , someone suitable for marriage , to enjoy the riches which old peleus has acquired
0	other trojans and their famous allies followed what excellent polydamas had said to them , but asius , son of hyrtacus , leader of men , did not want to leave his horses or their driver , the attendant charioteer
0	there were fallen leaves in piles around the place
0	athena , goddess with the gleaming eyes , replied :
0	wind-swift iris then answered achilles :
0	she left to bathe herself , put fresh clothing on her body , and went away ,
0	my crew had a quick meal beside the ships
0	we shook our tokens in a bronze helmet
0	automedon , swift ares ' equal , stripped the armour , boasting in triumph :
0	all right , old priam , things will be arrangedas you request
0	when he would gone about as far as mules plough in a single day—and in deep fields they outwork oxen pulling double-jointed ploughs— the two men ran after him
0	what fools we are to get incensed at zeusso stupidly !
0	if you kill me , a minstrel , for i sing
0	would show me a way home
0	of aegis-bearing zeus , then said to her :
0	with many others in my company ,
0	but when agamemnon saw soldiers holding back from hateful war , he would lash out at them in anger
0	in making lovely things , a noble heart ,
0	on a trip to sparta and sandy pylos , to learn about his father 's voyage home—
0	next he set up a mast
0	let 's throw these guests
0	once cyclops had stuffed his massive stomach
0	and killed the man
0	then , in the entrance to her cave , scylla
0	each and every day to get back home ,
0	and no matter what he says , his words will not be wasted
0	the sons of noble alcinous took the lovely gifts and set them down before their honoured mother
0	nor do i care for any prophecy
0	and then the gods
0	for odysseus , while i have been far away
0	no human being could climb up that rock
0	they all got up and went to the sea shore , then quickly dragged the black ship up onto dry ground , while eager attendants carried off their weapons
0	i have reached here only after wandering
0	when you run into him , you must move back , or you will end up in hades ' house , contraveningwhat destiny ordains
0	now , indeed , antilochus , i will give up my anger with you
0	do not let him hit you with his spear or slash youat close quarters with his sword
0	meanwhile , the trojans , shouting and scattering in panic , were jammed up in every pathway
0	achaeans wo not keep me back , not for long
0	for men to make a common pile againwould be most unfair
0	with his share of the loot they passed around
0	somewhere far from his native land and friends
0	he 's the fastest one there is
0	laertes , and he , too , was the father
0	as he thought of this in his mind and heart , helen came into the room , emerging from her fragrant high-roofed chamber
0	hurled things at him , but for a little while his firm heart kept enduring what we threw
0	yesterday , my armour on my shoulders ,
0	i claim worthy descent through tydeus , who lies in thebes hidden underground
0	they lashed them tight behind his back , as odysseus , laertes ' royal son , who had endured so much ,
0	then among them all telemachus spoke out
0	there 's no one like odysseus here who will guard our house from ruin
0	great-hearted agenor saw him drag the dead man
0	then they traced out the dimensions of a mound , using stones to mark its base around the pyre , and then piled earth on top
0	with a golden shuttle
0	they heard what priam said and readily agreed
0	and yet , in spite of this , her heart was never sorry for penelope ,
0	some property of mine
0	in my dear native land ,
0	she embraced the child on her sweet breast , smiling
0	but we will hold back ,
0	so he burned him in his finely decorated armourand raised a burial mound above the ashes
0	her lovely song when early spring arrives ,
0	high on her head
0	zeus sent me herea messenger , the mother who bore me , daughter of the old man of the sea
0	the many fine-fleeced sheep and then set sail
0	the two men then battled over cebriones , like two lions struggling on a mountain peak over a slaughtered deer , both ravenous , both filled with fighting fury— that 's how those two masters of the war shout fought , patroclus , menoetius ' son , and glorious hector , over cebriones , both keen to slash each other 's flesh with pitiless bronze
0	wise penelope then answered him and said :
0	in her voice and form she resembled mentor :
0	then shook white barley grain on top
0	around its outer edge , he fixed a triple rim , glittering in the light , attaching to it a silver carrying strap
0	then went into the polished tubs to have a bath
0	now lash these horses on until you reachour swift ships
0	dolon just stood there terrified , stammering , pale with fear— his teeth were chattering in his mouth
0	our animals , and not just one or two ,
0	tydeus ' son was trying to aim his gleaming spear point over the huge shield , to get ajax in the neck
0	he cut through the tendons behind both feet , from heel to ankle , threaded them with ox-hide thongs , and then tied these onto his chariot , leaving the head to drag behind
0	goes into exile , leaving his relatives
0	we put our faith in it as a firm defencefor ships and for ourselves
0	ormenus ' son , like an immortal god
0	ox-eyed queen hera trembled as she answered—her words had wings :
0	she set foot in her blazing chariot , grasping her huge , strong , heavy spear , with which she kills men , heroes who annoy her , goddess with a mighty father
0	well before the others
0	when they would put glittering bronze around their bodies , they opened up the doors and went outside
0	great-heated trojans , too , spoke words like these :
0	disputes they go through with their husbands
0	he fell down with a crash
0	or the family he claims to come from
0	at once , took their places on the rowing bench ,
0	inside this house , your wife and child , a man
0	with his master 's goods while he was far away
0	then i carved out my bed , till i was done
0	sarpedon 's spear hit tlepolemus right in the neck
0	geranian horseman nestor answered diomedes :
0	when someone mentions my good master
0	agamemnon stood over him , then hacked off his head , so it fell on iphidamas
0	it was thrown by peirous , son of imbrasus , captain of the thracians , who would come from aenus
0	but when the sun went down and darkness came ,
0	the cruel rock crushed both tendonsand the bone
0	when brave eurylochus ’ lot fell out ,
0	if you are my son and truly of our blood ,
0	well , eumaeus , i hope the gods pay back the injuries
0	before the year goes by , you will be giving birth to marvelous children , for a god 's embrace does not lack power
0	through her tears she spoke—
0	the other deities , those ranked below him , listened carefully
0	but i clung to the keel of my curved ship
0	a sure sign , so you will clearly know it 's me
0	above the blood , and , on the other side ,
0	he especially found too much pomp and circumstance for simple relationships , too many figures of speech and monstrosities for the straightforward characters
0	then let our singer end his song , so all of us ,
0	constant grief lay on his heart for his own son , antinous , the first man killed by lord odysseus
0	meanwhile odysseus eagerly devoured the meat
0	then amphinomus , splendid son of nisus ,
0	eurycleia went back through odysseus ' splendid home to tell a cable attached to the top of the round house and to a nearby pillar
0	we do not need more talk
0	here the will in in the highest danger
0	well , this is bad news—
0	he did not move the sceptre to and fro , but gripped it tightly , like some ignoramus—a bumpkin or someone idiotic
0	son of peleus , do not be so afraid
0	but her nights and days all end in sorrow , with her shedding tears
0	apollo raced on , only a little bit ahead , using his cunning
0	we captured thebes , city of seven gates , leading smaller forces over stronger walls , trusting signs sent by the gods and zeus ' aid
0	with your forceful words to drive this stranger
0	when , at this point , he sees to his horror how logic turns around on itself and finally bites its own tail , then a new form of knowledge breaks through , the acknowledgement of the tragic , which in order merely to be endured , requires art as a protector and healer
0	thick with whispering trees , mount neriton ,
0	come , i will tell you the trees you gave me once
0	my heart rejoiced—i thought it was no dream ,
0	the splendid queen , so i may speak to you
0	cloud-gatherer zeus then answered her and said :
0	do they have any more regard for you ?
0	then odysseus went to sit some distance off ,
0	not one of them will send us from their town
0	then the cattle herder answered him :
0	they are suitors for my mother—their pride
0	cloud-gatherer zeus then answered her and said :
0	but i stayed at that place a while , in case
0	however , to prevent this apollonian tendency from freezing form into egyptian stiffness and frigidity and to prevent the movement of the entire ocean from dying away , through the attempts of the apollonian tendency to prescribe to the individual waves their path and extent , from time to time the high flood of the dionysian destroys those small circles in which the one-sided apollonian will seeks to confine the greek spirit
0	patroclus , why predict my own death for me ?
0	pallas athena roamed throughout the city ,
0	and made a prophecy
0	hector , do not talk to me of our agreements
0	as for the others ,
0	and the sturdy courtyard wall and kill them
0	to various places , to sandy pylos
0	odysseus and i have not seen each other
0	to menace human beings
0	now the dithyrambic chorus takes on the task of stimulating the mood of the listeners right up to the dionysian level , so that when the tragic hero appeared on the stage , they did not see something like an awkward masked person but a visionary shape born , as it were , out of their own enchantment
0	the flames went out
0	then , after they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart 's content , each of them returned back home to get some rest
0	where achaeans suffered such distress ,
0	you would met your fatal end in trojan lands ,
0	bronze and gold lay there stacks , with clothing packed in chests and stores of fragrant oil
0	the skin on all of them changed colour
0	the two ajaxes moved back and forth along the wall , urging men on , firing up the fighting spirit in achaeans
0	and send him off in a chariot with your son
0	away from my companions , who would gone out ,
0	well , do as you wish , but we other godswill not all approve your actions
0	or did you meet some god who gave them to you ?
0	so we can set out pieces of the thigh
0	for this fact to be acknowledged , before it was established that all art inherently depended on the greeks , from homer right up to socrates , we had to deal with these greeks as the athenians dealt with socrates
0	to eat my wheat
0	at least that is my experience
0	as eupeithes said this , he wept , and all achaeans were seized by pity
0	he will get angry and stand up to proclaim
0	look there , child of aegis-bearing zeus , you tireless one , that dog fly once againis leading man-killing ares through the crowd , away from battle
0	to where her father lives , for he 's a man
0	prudent telemachus then answered him and said :
0	and no longer thinks about her children
0	that said , he spoke to antinous—his words had wings :
0	then he will add to this seven women of lesbos , skilled in crafts , whom he chose for himself when you captured well-built lesbos
0	slaughtering oxen , fat goats , and sheep
0	that would be entirely unfair to me
0	and thus the apollinian illusion reveals itself as what it really is -- the veiling during the performance of the tragedy of the real dionysian effect ; but the latter is so powerful that it ends by forcing the apollinian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to speak with dionysian wisdom and even denies itself and its apollinian visibility
0	the work for which we came remains undone
0	idomeneus did not relent his fighting frenzy
0	after evading death and fate , he shows up
0	something to wear whenever a great storm blew
0	looking like one of wise alcinous ' heralds
0	you would marry my child and become my son ,
0	i am prepared to swear the oath , as my heart bids , and , before the gods , i will not swear falsely
0	to milk each ewe and bleating goat ,
0	he raised a resounding yell , crying to his trojans :
0	apollo comes there with his silver bow
0	but when aegis-bearing zeus aroused him ,
0	the two men , godlike odysseus ' servants , then went in as well
0	deep in my heart
0	from the back cut of a white-tusked boar , lots of fat on either side , and called out to the herald :
0	and one receives more honours for oneself
0	in your own home you have changed my crew to pigs and keep me here
0	his unsheathed bow in hand , with an arrow
0	has given birth to such a noble son
0	one claimed he would paid in full , setting out his case before the people , but the other was refusing any compensation
0	may antinous come to a fatal end ,
0	then achilles , loved by zeus , moved into action
0	a sweet sleep binding me , shrouding my eyes ?
0	the miraculous mist dissolved away from him
0	hector , which of the achaeans will now fear you , since you are afraid of menelaus , who so far has been a feeble spearman ?
0	it 's made of gold—for all his days to come
0	because he would joined with taphian pirates
0	odysseus , as wise as zeus , led these troops , who came with him in twelve black ships
0	he clearly told you to assist the trojans , to defend them until evening comes , casting its shadows on the fertile farm land
0	may zeus destroy them before they harm us
0	remaining there until the light of dawn
0	now everything my dear heart once desired
0	as you have just said ?
0	those present listened carefully , then followed his advice
0	father zeus , will any mortal manon boundless earth , after this event , inform gods of his plans , of his intentions ?
0	geranian horseman nestor answered odysseus :
0	which will go as far , i think , even further
0	shrewd odysseus , still smiling , then continued :
0	he found cadmeans feasting in large numbers in the palace , home of great eteocles
0	his speed and strength , and then you would be amazed
0	that flow on earth
0	her father and her brothers are already telling her to marry
0	was far too little
0	now in that dream
0	odysseus moved throughout the army , calming things
0	day and night-time trails lie close together
0	as they moved on together
0	to kill a man , even as companions
0	i would prefer you keep those gifts yourself—
0	she summons to these halls
0	then he hit him , his sword slashing through his neck—his limbs collapsed , and iphidamas fell there into a bronze sleep , unhappy man , far from the wife he would married , to help his fellow citizens , far from that lady from whom he would had no favours , though for bride price
0	the ships were smashed to pieces by the waves
0	camped by the banks of the sangarius river
0	i went to where my ships were on the beach—
0	the assembly is the place for speeches
0	the greek were already fully on their way to labeling cleverly and arbitrarily the completely mythical dreams of their youth as historical , pragmatic , and youthful history
0	have snatched him off and left no trace
0	and you are attempting to confuse my mind
0	and reach your native land
0	if she knows that everything you say
0	have pulled from the gray sea up on the curving beach , lying piled up on the sand , longing for sea waves , while the bright sun takes away their life—that 's how the suitors then were lying in heaps on one another
0	but he sits there , all by himself , without a care , without a worry , claiming he 's supremeamong immortal gods , manifestly so , for strength and power
0	now , near the country of the cyclopes ,
0	across the fish-filled seas
0	all women an evil reputation ,
0	for now things stand upon a razor 's edge—miserable destruction for achaeansor their salvation
0	he spoke , then kissed his son
0	i left it open—
0	some racing drivers , trusting their chariot and horses , drive themcarelessly , moving back and forth , weaving on the course
0	and from ithaca itself twelve young men ,
0	and dishonouring the wife of a man who ,
0	right now he 's testing all the army
0	then aeneas killed two of the best danaans , crethon and orsilochus , whose father livedin well-built phere , a man of property , descended from the river alpheus , whose broad streamsflow through pylian land
0	so he challengedcadmean young men and beat them easily
0	put me and war-loving menelausin their midst to fight it out for helen , all her property
0	shrewd telemachus then answered nestor , saying :
0	take me alive , son of atreus—you will getgood ransom
0	possessions and a house built near my own
0	with strength like that , i could have stood with you
0	astonishingly so—to tell the truth ,
0	around the city , put up homes , raise temples
0	indeed , what is the dionysian ?
0	the sort you would not hope to come across
0	when i would had my fill of rolling in the sand
0	she took my hand and led me from the house
0	when the old man ,
0	now you must plunge
0	but so far hector 's wife knew nothing of all this , for no messenger had come to tell her clearly that her husband had remained outside the gates
0	having said these words , glorious hector took his plumed helmet in his hands
0	that lion-hearted man , whose qualities
0	here we have before our very eyes in the highest symbolism of art that apollonian world of beauty and its foundation , the frightening wisdom of silenus , and we understand , through intuition , the reciprocal necessity for both of them
0	achilles , you may be stronger , since your mother was divine , but he 's more powerful , for he rules more men
0	men stood outside them , trying to knock them down by force to pass on through
0	a brave and wealthy man
0	—he will hand overand add more goods from his own home
0	we landed at geraestus , where we offered
0	to be more active , put courage in his heart ,
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	the hero , the highest manifestation of the will , is destroyed , and we are happy at that , because , after all , he is only an illusion , and the eternal life of the will is not disturbed by his destruction
0	choose fifty-two young men who in the past
0	however , alongside this condition , the singer simultaneously , through a glimpse at the surrounding nature , becomes aware of himself as a subject of the pure , will-less knowledge , whose imperturbable , blessed tranquilly now enters to contrast the pressure of his always dull , always still limited willing
0	what men 's countries have you visited ?
0	that 's what someone would have said—he would never know what was going on
0	i will bring him on board
0	and the son born from the two of us
0	men ca not reject fine presents from the gods , those gifts they personally bestow on us , though no man would take them of his own free will
0	for some time she could not speak a word to him—
0	saying this , agamemnon held up his sceptre , invoking all the gods
0	in her chest the heart is quite divided ,
0	a cloak and tunic , and then send me off
0	on land or killed at sea by waves stirred up
0	looking down on the two men , the son of crooked-minded cronos pitied them
0	men from zeleia , on mount ida 's lowest slope , wealthy trojans , men who drink dark waters of the river aesepus were led by pandarus , lycaon 's worthy son , whom apollo had taught archery
0	they look like living servant girls , possessing minds , hearts with intelligence , vocal chords , and strength
0	live far away , for no one dwells near us ,
0	that old man shows under those rags of his
0	had firmly charged to watch out for his wife ,
0	at his words , the old man grew afraid
0	so you can carry the bright coverlets ,
0	on their way , they reached the river asopus , its lush grassy meadows full of reeds
0	up to the city , seeking idomeneus ,
0	i will not hold back , but go straight at their lines
0	in this shameful way
0	it wants to be exactly the opposite , the unadorned expression of the truth , and it must therefore cast off the false costume of that truth thought up by the man of culture
0	in an insulting , overbearing way ,
0	hera quickly lashed the horses with her whip
0	so they would set the ships in rows , and thus filled up the whole wide coastal bay between the headlands
0	but going back demoralized is bad
0	although her heart is sad , she feeds their hopes , by giving each man words of reassurance
0	when you see that ,
0	he did not repay his parents for the work they would done to rear him— he did not live long enough , slaughtered on the spear of great-hearted ajax
0	when he thought of going to bed to get some sleep , she told the women slaves
0	so let all this
0	she told me first of all
0	the herald , pontonous , then brought up a silver-studded chair for him
0	his bowels spilled out onto the ground
0	she did not reply—her words could find no wings
0	i wish pure artemis would quickly bring
0	the chief mourners stayed behind
0	but you do not seem to be a man like that
0	the old chariot fighter , produced the gold
0	he 's killed your trusty comrade podes , eëtion 's son , a noble front-line warrior
0	back from sandy pylos or from sparta
0	a man who visits as a wanderer
0	on the other side , ajax called out to his companions :
0	along each rowing bench
0	but he 's damagedargives in a major way , with actionsthey will remember for many years to come
0	optimistic dialectic , with its syllogistic whip , drove music out of tragedy , that is , it destroyed the essence of tragedy , which can be interpreted only as a manifestation and imaginary presentation of dionysian states , as a perceptible symbolizing of music , as the dream world of a dionysian intoxication
0	his work proceeded quickly
0	told the worthy swineherd to stand beside this door and watch , for there was just one way of reaching it
0	i thinkmany of them will be glad to get some rest , the ones who escape this deadly warand who evade my spear
0	when i would said this , circe went through the hall , her wand clutched in her hand , and opened up
0	his heart did not suspect there was a trick
0	but first let 's ask the gods
0	he surpassed all men of his own time in knowledge about birds and making prophecies
0	his mind works quickly , but his judgment 's suspect
0	after saying this , he handed the girl over
0	so now let 's thinkhow we may make amends , win him back with giftsand gracious speeches , and be friends once more
0	they flew off willingly , mid-way between the starry heaven and earth
0	once he gets here , he lies down to rest
0	that man was mulius , a spear fighter , son-in-law to augeias
0	whenever i move up to starry heaven
0	young and old , one of whom could well be king ,
0	at this , ares gave her his golden-bridled horses
0	at this lycaon 's noble son gave out a noisy shout :
0	and he will always eat his meals with us
0	as for your father , he stays on his farm
0	and then hung loops of it from roof beams high above , fine as spiders ' webs , impossible to see ,
0	in her hand she gripped a spear
0	odysseus recognized the river as it flowed
0	if , among human beings , you know of some
0	remember what i have said
0	whether it was that child of zeus , the muse ,
0	who lives here as my friend and treats me well
0	and in return i will sacrifice to you
0	so i will agree to your request
0	so let the black earthopen here for each of us
0	into the fields—such things warm servants ' hearts
0	i would have a curved scythe in my hands , and you
0	in their rooms , so i can put away in storage
0	the servers placed beside odysseus a portion
0	before that day , there are still many more
0	from god-nurtured kings who wield a sceptre
0	welcomed both of them and said :
0	in this sense the dialogue is an image of the greeks , whose nature reveals itself in dancing , because in dancing the greatest power is only latent , betraying its presence in the lithe and rich movement
0	his next of kin thus divided up his assets
0	with these words , hector of the shining helmet left that furious conflict and strode quickly off with rapid strides , following his companions , the men taking the famous armour of achilles towards the city
0	then , horseman patroclus , you made fun of him :
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	all the things that went on there in troy , all trojan and achaean suffering ,
0	they raced on like this about as far as a discus flies when tossed with a shoulder swing by a powerful young man testing his strength
0	brought on my fatal end
0	for the truth is this—of all the things which breathe or move on earth , nothing is more miserable than man
0	to be overly surprised your father
0	to a place between the round house and fine wall around the courtyard , herding them into a narrow space
0	i got to know them—from their appearance and their wise advice
0	but i do not think it 's all just as you said ,
0	other assets you could obtain elsewhere ,
0	it 's near the road , a clump of poplar trees
0	son of telamon , still full of anger
0	so i could tell him how , when i left here ,
0	for the titaressus is a branch of the river styx , dread waters by which the most solemn oaths are sealed
0	helper hermes accompanied them as well , the godwith the most cunning mind of all
0	once they would had food and drink to their heart 's content , telemachus and the noble son of nestor
0	so they fought on , like blazing fire
0	so he may go as quickly as he can ,
0	fleeces , cloaks , and shining coverlets
0	so the sun set
0	finally in prison he came to understand how , in order to relieve his conscience completely , to practice that music which he had considered insignificant
0	call each soldier by his father 's name , complimenting all of them
0	but there was nothing he could do to pull back now , retreat into the ranks
0	and in plain sight of all ?
0	made all our plans so hard to carry out
0	oh , make that happen
0	with an understanding heart
0	you look like a king
0	odysseus prayed , and pallas athena heard him
0	i saw phaedra , procis , and fair ariadne ,
0	thanks to my slaves , those ungrateful bitches
0	gentle sleep had overpowered nestor 's son ,
0	that old warrior , who , men say , no longer comes
0	the finest goats by far from all the herds ,
0	my son , from what you have just been saying , you are fated to an early death , for your doomcomes quickly as soon as hector dies
0	they cooked these on split wood , then placed the innards on spits in hephaestus ' fire
0	but your mind is empty
0	in his hand he held up on a golden staff the scarf sacred to archer god apollo
0	my fond exhausted heart slept through the night , past daybreak and noon—not until the sun
0	odysseus rose from his soft bed and told his wife :
0	to some other place ?
0	though each of you shares in this honour , too
0	the kind of wine we had on board our ship , a gift of drink i was carrying for you ,
0	for one more year , although it 's hard for me
0	geranian horseman nestor then said to patroclus :
0	do not try to comfort me about my death ,
0	gracious hebe went among them , pouring nectar
0	here you will meet your doom , though as a fighter , you are so formidable and brave
0	first , she led the sure-footed horses against ares
0	a man raised by zeus , shimmered in the light ,
0	for i say this—no achaean will beat me with his fistsand take this mule
0	i wish i would died and met my fate right there ,
0	once there , he can beg food from anyone
0	beside the fire where she used to sit , they placed a chair for her , inlaid with ivory and silver
0	there is a very ancient folk belief , especially in persia , that a wise magus could be born only out of incest
0	if these two had died , then we would have somethingreal to grieve about
0	the son of atreus , famous spearman menelaus , struck him , as he stood up in his chariot , hitting him right on his collar bone
0	but these suitors here , i think , know something—
0	by you and by my honourable mother ,
0	then the phaeacian counselors and leaders ,
0	the race of men who walk upon the groundcan never match the race of deathless gods
0	i would publicize your fame
0	i just do not know
0	as a man can shout , moving forward quickly ,
0	and cry out in distress
0	well , i claim i am great anchises ' son , and aphrodite is my mother
0	i do not think we will bring this talkto a successful end , not on this trip
0	resourceful odysseus then replied to him and said :
0	then she promised she would offer perfect sacrifice
0	menelaus , son of atreus , stood there over him , holding his long-shadowed spear
0	leocritus , son of evenor—he struck him
0	the lovely goddess then replied :
0	the bronze point smashed straight through the frontal bone
0	adrestus fell onto his back
0	and for us there is no consolation ,
0	swift-footed achilles then said to priam :
0	like the balm well-crowned cytherea rubs on herself when she goes to the joyful dancing of the graces
0	he stirred up winds
0	the deathless god appeared before odysseus
0	you poor wretch , you are not considering your own death at all—it 's getting closer
0	resourceful odysseus then answered her and said :
0	off now to your sty , and lie in there
0	no woman in your household
0	before it could , it snapped off at the socket
0	resourceful odysseus , laertes ' son ,
0	the dead were making noises , like birds
0	phoebus , why do we two stand aloof ?
0	he has my blessing !
0	about a friend of mine , if he 's still alive
0	my misguided king , do you think achaea 's sons are really fearful cowards , as you state ?
0	as he did so , lord odysseus shot an arrow
0	be careful , son of dardanus
0	i do not know if he 's going to scout our shipsor strip some dead man 's corpse
0	that 's why i will never issue such an order
0	then you would find out how strong i am and what my hands can do
0	the speeches of teiresias of thebes ,
0	their frequent reckless conduct in your home ,
0	even though he 's dead , persephone
0	then you would not have seen lord agamemnon sleeping , hiding , or not keen to fight
0	he grabbed telemachus ' hand and said to him :
0	how blind he was , poor fool !
0	i was so tired , sweet sleep fell over me
0	i will leave my house ,
0	should not my longing overleap the distance
0	she crossed the wooden threshold—a long time ago a skillful craftsman planed it , set it straight and true , then fitted doorposts and set shining doors in place
0	and hope i will find a sloping beach somewhere
0	swift iris , with feet like the wind , replied :
0	i want to fight
0	to get back again
0	they quickly got the suitors to give up their games and had them sit down all together in a group
0	the others ' horses may be faster runners , but the drivers are no better skilled than you
0	angry with her , he went down into that huge crowd of trojans and woke up hippoco ön , a thracian counselor , one of noble rhesus ' family
0	people themselves learned from euripides how to speak
0	but when a man laments all day , his heart
0	water poured upon our hands , then once again
0	and in my heart , priam , i recognize—it 's no secret to me—that some godled you here to the swift achaean ships
0	an arrow struck eurypylus in the thigh
0	a high dark wave rose arching over them ,
0	for jason was her friend
0	it drove on through two layers , but there were still three more , for crippled god hephaestus had hammered out five layers , two made of bronze , two inner ones of tin , with a gold one in between
0	but he did not repay his fond parents for raising him
0	a family which , in days to come , will have a famous name , since penelope
0	and who , on the other hand , would think of making only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those florentine circles and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the love of the opera which spread with such rapidity ?
0	a fine and worthy man dear to your heart ?
0	i do not think you will come back unsuccessfulin getting what it is your heart desires
0	who did not get back home
0	today i found no one else strong enough for that
0	i will sound out my father ,
0	dryops fell at achilles ' feet
0	you know all things ?
0	his head rolled in the dust as he was speaking
0	son of atreus , meet his death ?
0	that 's what i said
0	but never thought to see it !
0	so come , then , shoot an arrow at him—at splendid menelaus
0	then he left the hut , going to lie down and rest where the white-tusked boars slept beneath a hollow rock , sheltered from north wind
0	the bronze breastplate he was wearing did not help him— the spear lodged in his gut
0	stopped barking and fawned around him
0	will touch my feet , none of the serving women
0	now , there was a certain mancalled euchenor , son of polyidus the prophet , a rich , brave man , who lived at home in corinth
0	men from nisyrus , crapathus , casus , cos , eurypylus ' city , the calydnian islands had pheidippus and antiphus , sons of lord thessalus , hercules ' son , as leaders
0	sent you out here ?
0	so you can understand there is no joy for me in being king
0	or i may bring gods ' anger down on you
0	telemachus moved up to where his room was built ,
0	to set their hands to the ship 's rigging
0	dressed in a filthy , shabby , patched-up tunic
0	any other women of the household
0	for my part , i advise us to returninto the city—we should not stay here , on the plain , waiting for dawn beside the ships
0	ask penelope to come here with her slaves ,
0	he set out goblets made of gold , as a herald went back and forth pouring their wine
0	their monstrous acts of wanton foolishness ,
0	you are the one who longs to get back home , once evening comes , before the others
0	a dark wave swallowed her
0	now here you are again , asking meto do something i simply must not do
0	the watchman went straight to the palace to report the news
0	he groaned aloud and struck his thighs with both his palms , then expressed his grief , saying :
0	the swiftest of all flying things , could match her speed , as she raced ahead , slicing through the ocean waves , carrying a man whose mind was like a god 's
0	at dawn bright-eyed achaeanswill organize for battle round the city
0	as well as ten gold talents
0	i might try the bow myself
0	six daughters as well as six full-grown sons
0	those bristles brought on by that nasty drug
0	are coming home with empty hands
0	they put dry kindling round them , hard seasoned wood , freshly split by axe
0	you make me call to mind the suffering
0	lord odysseus cried out in triumph :
0	we will hold off the trojans and godlike hector , standing behind you with a single heart , just as we share one name
0	at troy , if he would come safely back , bringing
0	while i look on in pain
0	in our assembly you are all infants , silly children , with no sense of war 's events
0	i had inside my home , providing him
0	here in my home , i will give you the finest ,
0	you two need not continue wrestling
0	when leiodes had finished ,
0	could you yourself produce a strategy
0	as i travel on my journey homeward ?
0	i can not talk of him in any detail
0	and come here to my farm
0	he will drive achaeans back a second time , once he 's turned them into cowards
0	but now achillesprays that north wind and loud west wind will come
0	arching high above his head , and drove it at him
0	here wise penelope sat , while white-armed servants came from the women 's hall and started to remove the lavish amounts of food , the tables , and the cups high-spirited suitors had been drinking from
0	he spoke winged words of sympathy :
0	that odysseus had come
0	for both sides a major fight ensued
0	he stirred up a second nasty quarrel
0	he stayed there , but my father roamed around
0	just like that , the din rose upthroughout the widespread trojan force
0	underneath them divine earth made fresh flowers grow— dew-covered clover , crocuses , and hyacinths , lush and soft , to hold the lovers off the ground
0	if you were to spend five or six years here
0	then , after quickly cutting down brush wood ,
0	with respect to the astonishing daring with which aeschylus places the olympian world on his scales of justice , we must remind ourselves that the deep-thinking greek had an unshakably firm basis for metaphysical thinking in his mystery cults , and that he could unload all his skeptical moods onto the olympians
0	with a cry , she threw herself on him , hands tearing at her breast , her tender neck , her lovely face , fair as a goddess , lamenting :
0	or at least his image , for he himself
0	or else kill the men , while i take care of them
0	besides , he 's healthy , and he is no fool
0	encased in shriveled skin
0	they have all taken refuge , like dogs around a lion
0	until we move into the city and reach
0	would treat me badly , and some deity
0	these men stood in line , as achilles pointed out the turning post— the race course was the distance there and back
0	you go at me like this , with such anger
0	i will stay and stand up to their attack
0	he set me in his chariot ,
0	do all this , you great-hearted trojans , just as i have said
0	he left me there ,
0	then he slaughtered pylon , as well as ormenus
0	so zeus did not want patroclus to become merely a plaything for the dogs of his trojan enemies
0	he would not escape his grim fate and come back from the ships to windy troy , proudly boasting of his chariot and horses
0	shrewd telemachus then said to menelaus in reply :
0	he was called arnaeus—his honoured mother
0	three times he thought it through in his mind and heart , and three times counselor zeus
0	then two long spears flew from their hands together
0	tie it round your breasts
0	after saying this , apollo took a seat high up on pergamus
0	under the incessantly changing phenomena the eternal primordial mother , always forcing things into existence , always satisfied with the changing nature of appearances !
0	in just that way , fair-haired menelaus stood above patroclus
0	with their own eyes all say the same—we both
0	you fool , do not offer me a ransom or some plea
0	and freezing wind , his dear son had met me ,
0	the chosen man will greatly benefitwell-armed achaeans and his own heart , too—if he comes away from this grim fight , this dangerous combat
0	gripping the scales , he raised them by the centre
0	sophocles was the third person named in this hierarchy , the man who could praise himself in comparison with aeschylus by saying that he ( sophocles ) did what was right because he knew what was right
0	with my sharp bronze , i was to wound her
0	was in decline did that sweet sleep release me
0	to come in here—they can stand beside me
0	with curving boats drawn up along the road ,
0	a splendid chest , which she filled with precious gifts , the clothing and the gold brought by phaeacians
0	eumaeus , some comrade of yours is coming ,
0	instead , waves from the sea and deadly blasts of fire carry away
0	so why mislead me with such questioning ?
0	your mother first got the report
0	so standing above priam 's head , he said to him :
0	long-suffering lord odysseus was pleased and spoke out in prayer , saying :
0	daughter of great-hearted arsinous , she would been chosen for him by achaeans , because he excelled them all in giving wise advice
0	he 's gone where people can not see or hear him ,
0	a long way by his father and other senior men ,
0	so long as the single creator of order and ruler of all , the mind , was still excluded from artistic creativity , everything was still mixed up in a chaotic primordial pudding
0	renowned odysseus , your store of tricks , of suffering , is infinite
0	that 's what he said
0	i do not blame you in the least , for anyone
0	once he would heard the unwelcome news , hephaestus went into his forge , pondering some nasty scheme deep in his heart
0	then the crowd of women came ,
0	he hit lord antinous and went on shooting ,
0	that heart in your chest always thinks this way
0	are like their fathers
0	dark blood at once came flowing from the wound
0	the appearance of a swallow
0	nothing can be more offensive to our stage techniques than the prologue in euripides 's plays
0	she incited the two sons of atreus
0	far and wide through greece and central argos
0	but he never finished what he had to say
0	i have suffered and struggled through so much ,
0	she gave telemachus the fine two-handled cup
0	strangers being abused and female servants
0	and so for three years
0	the spectator without a play is a contradictory idea
0	her dreadful grieving and her sorry tears
0	bringing water in a basin etched with flowers
0	and trust me in your hearts—here 's the old scar
0	with misery and painful wretchedness
0	for that reason the book should at this point be handled with some consideration and discretion
0	teucer , my friend , mastor 's son , our worthy comrade , has been killed
0	my child , why have you left hard battle to come here ?
0	or until she misses me or learns i have gone ,
0	meriones stooped down and scooped them from the plainwith his own hands , then spoke to idomeneus :
0	but the old man
0	brought on your death
0	but once the waves have smashed my raft apart ,
0	the shadowy mountains of your country
0	agamemnon 's sharewas fair-skinned chryseis
0	he pulled on his shining bronze
0	a weak man , too , in future days , or else
0	in ithaca he never did or said
0	he 's wiped outso many achaean men , good ones , too , and so rashly
0	for counselor zeuswo not let me fight these trojans all day long
0	and so one may verify ( in an eccentric way ) what schopenhauer says of the man trapped in the veil of maja : as on the stormy sea which extends without limit on all sides , howling mountainous waves rise up and sink and a sailor sits in a row boat , trusting the weak craft , so , in the midst of a world of torments , the solitary man sits peacefully , supported by and trusting in the principium individuationis [ the principle of individuality ] ( world as will and idea , vol
0	today i would state that it was the problem of scholarship itself , scholarly research for the first time grasped as problematic , as dubious
0	odysseus , you no longer have that firm spirit and force you once possessed
0	this , you must know , is the arching cavern
0	he told him to do it
0	then great telamonian ajax moved out front , and strong diomedes , son of tydeus , got up
0	i am sure that for countless men precisely this , and only this , is the effect of tragedy , but it plainly follows that all these men , together with their interpreting aestheticians , have had no experience of tragedy as a supreme art
0	will not bring you distress and suffering—
0	so now , let that be ,
0	all the property which paris brought herein his hollow ships to troy—how i wish he would died before that day !
0	i am no weakling
0	giving his armour to his noble comrade laodocus , who drove the horses close beside him , he set off on the run
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	now , though menelaus was still very keen
0	may that man come , and led on by some god
0	in that trojan land , when achaeans shot ,
0	we have each got only one
0	dawn will soon be here
0	and came at once to tell hephaestus
0	first on his legs he set his shin guards—beautifully made , fitted with silver ankle clasps
0	from somewhere far away , if you must ask
0	of wise penelope , icarius ' daughter ,
0	bronze and gold and piles of woven clothing ,
0	she 's brought here some shipwrecked vagrant , a man whose people
0	he would seized it as a prizewhen he would destroyed the city of eëtion
0	that how some god has spun a fate for him
0	which made him stand out among danaans
0	she bathed herself and took fresh clothing for her body
0	feeding on the plant , eager to forget
0	with these words , achilles stirred the spirit in each man
0	so ox-eyed queen hera then began considering how she might deceive the mind of aegis-bearing zeus
0	of brave telemachus and bring back
0	and reaches full maturity
0	answer what i am asking
0	where men speak a foreign tongue , if , in fact ,
0	he was turning it this way and that , testing it
0	around thymbreare positioned lycians , mysians , impetuous fighters , and phrygians , who fight on horseback , and from maeoniathere are charioteers
0	would have appeared with them still weeping there , if goddess athena with the gleaming eyes ,
0	keeping watch on them , while i sent out scouts
0	for you are king of an extensive plain
0	eumaeus looked at the man , scolded him , then , lifting up his hands in prayer , he cried aloud :
0	his attendant was holding them some distance off , while he went on foot through those fighting at the front , until lord diomedes robbed him of his life
0	was finished with you , we set your white bones
0	for we are astonished , as soon as we compare the theatre public we know well with that chorus and ask ourselves whether it would be at all possible on the basis of this public to derive some idealization analogous to the tragic chorus
0	i came down to the sea and reached the ship
0	how he might get the shameless suitors in his grip , one man against so many
0	we should all assemble , then carry off the bodies of the deadwith mules and oxen
0	then atreus ' son would have easily carried off the celebrated armour of the son of panthous , if phoebus apollo had not been offended
0	bathed me in the river , and gave me clothes
0	and speak candidly—who are your people ?
0	while wind and helmsman held us on our course
0	i grieve for him much more than for my husband
0	they all agreed with his suggestion
0	now famous spearman odysseus was left alone , no achaean there beside him , for fear gripped them all
0	there his wife ran up to meet him , andromache , daughter of great-hearted eëtion , who would included a large dowry with her
0	responding to telemachus , geranian horseman nestor said :
0	sometimes south wind would toss it over to north wind to carry
0	should we desire to combine the two conceptions that have just been shown to have influenced the origin of opera , it would merely remain for us to speak of an idyllic tendency of the opera
0	taller and stronger , and on his head she curled
0	he killed great-hearted bathycles , chalcon 's dear son , who lived at home in hellas , a man pre-eminent among the myrmidons for a wealthy and successful life
0	odysseus led them out
0	keep sitting in the hall or at the door
0	but they had trouble standing up to hector 's charge , as he attacked the ships
0	may some god lead you home ,
0	why turn the matter now
0	all those schemes he 's thought up in your home
0	then scamander , the deep-flowing river , cried out to apollo :
0	godlike telemachus was the first to see him ,
0	nestor took a strong spear with a sharp bronze point , then stood outside the hut
0	many soldiersfollowed him , and he was pre-eminent in war
0	some spears hurled by brave hands flew swiftly forward , then stuck in his great shield , and many stood upright in the space between them , impaled in earth , still eager to devour his flesh
0	wagging their long tails
0	with pain beyond all hope
0	but now i really havea dreadful fear of peleus ' swift-footed son
0	hera , why 's your son burning up my stream , doing it more injury than any other ?
0	telemachus prepares for his voyage
0	lord odysseus then , with his trickery ,
0	did he do it to make sure
0	than give it to another man
0	his skin would have been stripped and all his bones smashed up ,
0	from your own womb you must have given birthto these long-haired achaeans
0	for it is the lot of every myth gradually to creep into the crevice of an assumed historical reality and to become analyzed as a unique fact in answer to the historical demands of some later time or other
0	according to this insight and to the tradition , dionysus , the essential stage hero and centre of the vision , was not really present in the very oldest periods of tragedy , but was only imagined as present
0	for i do not think you reached this place on foot
0	should the dionysian exist at all ?
0	and so the race of noble arcesius
0	with a sharp cry , she cradled her son 's head , then spoke
0	by some other man , one who had no land
0	once his living spirithas abandoned him , send death and sweet sleepto carry him away , back to the spacious landof lycia , where his brother and his kinsmenwill bury him with a mound and headstone
0	for her to show up among the suitors
0	remain among the living
0	just as those times when the stars shine bright in heaven , clustered around the glowing moon , with no wind at all , and every peak and jutting headland , every forest glade is clearly visible , when every star shines out ,
0	his sons came from their rooms and gathered round him in a throng—echephron ,
0	i am talking to the suitors most of all
0	let someone else take hold of it
0	the crewmen loosed the cables
0	then geranian horseman nestor began to speak
0	the performing artist was really at a loss how to deal with a listener who comported himself so critically ; so he , as well as the dramatist or operatic composer who inspired him , searched anxiously for the last remains of life in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment
0	and placed it by her side , filled with fine-spun yarn
0	i am not from the same wombas hector , the man who killed your comrade , that kind and powerful warrior
0	begging as a dear friend at your knee
0	let each of you go up against your manin full warrior fury
0	but this man wants to put the rest to shame , rule all of us , lord it over everyone
0	aphrodite , trying to coax some new achaean womaninto running off with one of those trojansshe loves so much , must have been caressingsome well-dressed achaean lady and scratchedher delicate hand on a golden brooch
0	they washed their hands , and picked up the barley grain for sprinkling
0	amazement came in her heart—
0	aeneas then said to apollo in reply :
0	but they could not , with that response , conceal that they themselves were , nonetheless , internally related and similar to those deposed titans and heroes
0	as these two were talking like this to each other , the other herdsmen came in with their swine
0	before his wedding day
0	my reputation then would be more famous ,
0	when circe noticed me just sitting there ,
0	tell me now , you muses living on olympus , which of the achaeans was first to carry off bloody trophies from the men who would just been slaughtered , when famous earthshaker turned the tides of war
0	or else to answer back from where we were ,
0	many lovely swords , with dark mountings , fell to earth , from hands and shoulders of those fighting warriors
0	her mother also gave her some smooth olive oil
0	he followed closely in the goddess ' footsteps
0	now fatal death has overtaken him
0	were swallowed up in fog
0	he shook his head in silence
0	the mother fluttered around here and there , lamenting her dear chicks
0	his acts would bring about his total ruin
0	at daybreak , i will take you there and organize an ambush
0	how is all this going to end up for me ?
0	meanwhile , odysseus and the faithful swineherd
0	they have met disaster through their foolishness
0	he sat some distance from the ships , shot off an arrow— the silver bow reverberating ominously
0	my orders tell meto speak to you to see if you are willing to put a stop to the harsh clash of war , until such time as we have burned our dead
0	then he put around his chest the body armour belonging to his brother lycaon
0	your comrades , over there in circe ’ s house ,
0	patroclus went to achilles , his people 's shepherd , shedding warm tears , like a fountain of dark water whose stream flows over the lip of a sheer rock face
0	after saying this , odysseus began to count the lovely tripods ,
0	the fruit of this condition is an ascetic condition , in which one denies the power of the will
0	you must enjoy our hospitality
0	in their hearts the suitors were amazed
0	is the very worst of trials for men ?
0	you and i alone will investigate
0	at once the god held back his flow ,
0	and three horses , too , and , as well as these ,
0	he may well be in orchomenus or in sandy pylos ,
0	my friends , we are not going down to hades ' house just yet , although we ’ re grieving , not until the day
0	she whipped the horses on
0	has hurt well-armed achaeans , and now ,
0	it struck him in the chest , right by the nipple
0	he made a stand by pandarus , like a lion , confident of its strength
0	two of the best working men now living could not lever that stone out of the ground easily into their cart , but hector carried it with ease alone
0	resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
0	leader of your people , that incident
0	this trip of ours
0	i feel it also in my lower limbs
0	so you invite this man to come as well ?
0	tricked me with his story
0	then the group surrounding sly and shrewd odysseus once more threw sharp spears into the crowd of suitors , and once again odysseus , sacker of cities ,
0	then darkness veiled his eyes , and his spirit left him
0	inside our ship was gone , they had to roam ,
0	and the beard around his chin turned black again
0	so for two days and nights he floated on the ocean waves , his heart filled
0	the pile of dead bodies grew , as they fell—trojans , proud allies , danaans , too , all together
0	when i get home
0	you would be disgraced among all men and shamed
0	glorious odysseus , you ask about your honey-sweet return
0	penelope , astonished , went back to her rooms ,
0	while i am being badly treated , even if
0	for i think i will hear of it
0	we will leave him in odysseus ' palace ,
0	you are not sending me back home , when you tell me to get across that huge gulf of the sea
0	my heart always divided in my chest ,
0	men of ithaca , listen to me now , hear what i have to say
0	odysseus , divinely bred , laertes ’ resourceful son , so you are going to fly back home ,
0	to his father 's palace
0	but anyway , now this stranger 's come here ,
0	beyond the courtyard , but near the door , stands an enormous orchard ,
0	and find delight in your own suffering ?
0	so you must leave quickly
0	there he first struck pronous with his shining spear , where pronous ' shield had left his chest exposed
0	my dear mother , do not bring me some sweet wine , for you will weaken me
0	warped his better judgment—perhaps it was
0	that 's how i met my fate and died , as well
0	who had endured so much , considered what to do
0	the horses flew on willingly , chests flecked with foam , their underbellies caked with dust , as they took the exhausted king away and left the battle
0	then old priam stood on that wall built by gods , observing huge achilles as he drove the trojans ahead of him in total panic , their spirit broken
0	his words had wings :
0	he 's urging men to give him gifts
0	when my elbow nudged him , he was all ears ,
0	and poured water out into a silver basin ,
0	but then swift-footed , godlike achilles spoke :
0	when they live well and are considered wealthy
0	it 's a stream of nectar and ambrosia
0	it 's name is not unknown—
0	then apollo charged out to meet achilles , seeking to protect the trojans from destruction , as they fled straight for the high-walled city , suffering from thirst and dusty from the plain
0	but gave them lotus plants to eat , whose fruit ,
0	creatures with lovely manes , quickly back to pylos
0	then death carried him into its shadows
0	you have just questioned me about
0	that 's how euripides must have thought about it ; that 's how he , the first sober poet must have passed sentence on the drunken poets
0	i replied and calmed them down :
0	water spilled out on the ground
0	they had bristles , heads , and voices just like pigs—
0	i say he will , then set your men on me
0	but jumping to one side , polydamas nimbly avoided his dark fate
0	let my comrades eat , then send them out
0	briseis , looking like golden aphrodite , then saw patroclus mutilated by sharp bronze
0	is really hard to sway
0	i think , to roam around among mankind
0	they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome
0	he 's close by , still alive in the rich land
0	to find out if he can recognize me ,
0	with this man 's singing of the evil fate
0	knew who i was , and with a cry of grief ,
0	around his chestthe bronze rang fearfully , as he moved into action , a sound to make even brave warriors afraid
0	these men here , they spend all their time like this , with songs and music—it 's so easy for them ,
0	but ships can moor there in a place with openings in both directions
0	what should it be called ?
0	he ran to those in front , calling in a loud voice :
0	she went on ahead of him to make things safe
0	so i stood upright hard against the mast
0	could convince his wife or his dear son
0	in the rear , he placed his many brave foot soldiers , a battle wall
0	and were keen to bring him home unharmed
0	by contrast , what are we to make of what killed tragedy—socratic morality , dialectic , the satisfaction and serenity of the theoretical man ?
0	wherever patroclus saw the biggest crowd of soldiers in retreat , with a yell he charged at them
0	they left the ships and came to a smooth road ,
0	with an amazement which was all the greater as he sensed with horror that all this may not be really foreign to him , that even his apollonian consciousness was covering the dionysian world in front of him , like a veil
0	further brutal war and dreadful battle ,
0	you would much prefer to stuff yourself with food
0	once i caught sight of her ,
0	and raise the alarm as swiftly as we can
0	there he walked on in the form of a young prince with his first hair on his lip , looking that age when charms of youth are at their loveliest
0	when the spirit bids , you can get some rest
0	in a distant corner of the house , where they kept
0	aphrodite brought , when she would led me there ,
0	who keep on slaughtering his flocks of sheep
0	do not tell me i should rinse my body off
0	was the only one to hesitate
0	in order to celebrate itself , its creatures had to sense that they were worthy of being glorified—they must see themselves again in a higher sphere , without this complete world of contemplation affecting them as an imperative or as a reproach
0	odysseus finished , then threw around his shoulders his ragged bag full of holes , with a twisted strap
0	cried out , too , all those inside the house , young and old
0	i know well enough i am fated to die here , far from my loving parents
0	there periphlegethon and cocytus ,
0	with these goods of mine
0	he would sworn an empty oath , but dolon was encouraged
0	not one of them
0	instead he hit lycophron , son of mastor , from cythera , one those attending ajax
0	whenever he went off to war in his black ships
0	i asked about the aesthetic pleasure , though i know full well that many of these images also produce at times a moral delight , for example , under the form of pity or moral triumph
0	enjoy our banquet , but no more shouting ,
0	father zeus , it seems you gods are still
0	in the middle of the meeting
0	of other people , the way men cross the sea to visit one another in their ships—
0	if not , i will steal your sweet life with one spear throw
0	the eagle released the fawn , dropping it right beside that splendid altar where achaeans sacrificed to all-knowing zeus
0	who had endured so much , was the first to speak :
0	in vain we look for a single vigorously developed root , for a spot of fertile and healthy soil : everywhere there is dust and sand ; everything has become rigid and languishes
0	you had died there with him
0	and the hearth of excellent odysseus ,
0	to swear a mighty oath on my behalf ,
0	now zeus incited them to war
0	telemachus , let your mother test me in these halls
0	sarpedon withdrew a little from the parapet , but did not retreat completely , for his heart was set on seizing glory
0	in there well-timbered ships can ride without being moored , phorcys was an ancient god of the sea , father of a number of monsters
0	all around her cave
0	they set him in a chariot and took him away , full of sorrow , to sacred ilion
0	holds out his hand to guard him
0	to see their skill and test them man to man
0	for the atrocious stench of sea-born seals
0	we—the sacred army of argive spearmen—
0	because we would been such fools , there was no breeze to help us on our way
0	but when achilleshas met his fate and died , then you may fightin full confidence among those at the front , for of all achaeans no one else will kill you
0	all of high ilionhas been destroyed
0	my son , whom i so love , away from home ,
0	one of those mortals living on the earth ,
0	hold off , hephaestus , splendid child
0	on a massive fire , while high above our heads
0	there with him in the palace
0	his house and his possessions in phoenicia
0	so he raced ahead and got back to the crowd ,
0	controls the land unchallenged and can feast in banquets with his equals , or at least
0	to cretheus—aeson , pheres , and amythaon—
0	you ’ ll stay there with the rest of them
0	when he stood up in well-built lesbos once
0	but soon enough he would rouse himself again
0	other gods , all through olympus , were very anxious , but just stood there , unable to untie you
0	zeus and other eternal gods forbid
0	it 's wrong to go on suffering grief for ever
0	standing by priam , swift-footed iris spoke , sounding like polites , priam 's son
0	it 's easy for the gods who hold wide heaven
0	and looked around for hiding places
0	your godlike wife by giving courtship gifts
0	you should recognize me—agamemnon , son of atreus , the one whom zeusalways loads with miserable fortune , more so than other men , so long as breathstays in my chest and movement in my limbs
0	next mentor , who would been noble odysseus ' companion ,
0	i will not obey you any more
0	is it because i am filthy ,
0	the finest beasts in helios ' herd
0	we all know that
0	and our finest man has perished—sarpedon , child of zeus , who would not assist his son
0	dione , queen among the goddesses , replied :
0	surely a higher pleasure must be perceived in all this
0	i ’ m ready to wrap my conquering handsaround my spear
0	the people of phaeacia , who love the oar ,
0	we came to thebe , eëtion 's sacred city , sacked it , taking everything the city had
0	how will you learn from me ,
0	if i leave this fine armourand patroclus , who lies here because he triedto avenge my honour , some danaan , seeing this , will call me a disgrace
0	blowing from your stern , so you may reach
0	beside it , on an angle , they made a common grave , back from the plain
0	just as our fathers were so long ago
0	that speech of yours provokes me
0	towards the high-roofed palace
0	when these foals played ,
0	over the sea in our swift ship , waiting
0	together with long-robed ctimene ,
0	for wretched human beings
0	so this stranger has his gifts in hand
0	as far as i am concerned ,
0	a portion of the meat , set it in front of him , and lifted some bread for him out of the basket
0	you see in me the use of poetry—
0	just as for mortal men zeus bends his coloured rainbow down from heaven , an omen prophesying war or some harsh storm , upsetting flocks and stopping men from workupon the earth—that 's how athena then placed herself in the achaean throng , wrapped in a purple mist
0	you will soon be with the swine
0	so long as war-loving meleager was in the fight , the curetes did not do well
0	are close relations of the gods
0	wide-ruling agamemnon grabbed the spear in his fists and yanked it towards him with the fury of a lion , pulling it away , right out of iphidamas ' hands
0	i was carried by the wind from troy
0	philoetius , and eumaeus , and told them all
0	that 's what they said
0	in that crowd , men 's hearts were set to slaughter one another with sharp bronze
0	they must attach the rope ends there as well
0	because we carried everyone in safety
0	in days gone by might come
0	has ever yet been sure about his parents
0	in his home he honoured her the way he did
0	so now the spirit here in my own chestis even keener than before to fight
0	lord odysseus sat down there
0	when patroclus had cut the trojans ' front ranks off , he pushed them back again towards the ships , keeping them from the city they were trying to reach
0	and made it shake
0	eumaeus also prayed like that to all the gods
0	but this time , he was up and roaming well ahead of me
0	least of all the reality of this world of appearance , for it says to us : look there !
0	fighting hard in battle after battle ,
0	in front of him he held his spear and a round shield , eager to kill anyone who might come at him
0	tell me now , you muses inhabiting olympus , who was the first to come against agamemnon— one of the trojans or one of their famous allies ?
0	there are many herds and flocks , plenty of wine ,
0	we think that you are a matchfor swirling xanthus in a fight
0	and all this treasure here ,
0	where you made many sacrificial gifts
0	the son of tydeus picked up a stone , a massive rock which no two men now alive could lift
0	by her dear children , by alcinous himself ,
0	you are here , and you babble all the time
0	they learned to work from the immortal gods
0	instead , they crept away , whimpering in fear , to the far side of the hut
0	father , i am here—the very man you asked about
0	your life is fated to be short—you will not live long
0	and we do not know
0	and he was there , covered with blood and gore ,
0	i have no objection , my child , to providing mules for you ,
0	or fights will happen here
0	struck the woman , and she fell with a thud
0	and i will describe for you every detail ,
0	for mighty agamemnon calls for you to look at warrior menelaus , achaea ’ s leader ,
0	but still , i answered him by saying :
0	you have a man like this one ,
0	both gods had a common father— the same family , too—but zeus was older and more wise
0	telemachus stopped him and said :
0	her feet are soft , she walks , not on the ground , but on men 's heads , and she brings folly onto humankind , seducing them at random
0	let us ask ourselves whether the feverish and uncanny excitement of this culture is anything but the greedy seizing and snatching at food of a hungry man -- and who would care to contribute anything to a culture that can not be satisfied no matter how much it devours , and at whose contact the most vigorous and wholesome nourishment is changed into history and criticism ?
0	though she was sad , it was a pleasure for me
0	am the thirteenth king
0	he will bring men to help him
0	with a grieving heart , hephaestus went up to his home , stood at the front door , where a cruel anger gripped him
0	son of atreus , which god helped your plan and forged a scheme so you could lie in wait
0	when they reached the stream of the fair-flowing river , where the washing tubs were always standing ready , full of fresh water flowing up from underneath
0	to drown , to sink --
0	not if you are eager to return
0	was happy listening , and sleep did not come down across her eyelids until he would told it all
0	hoping in his heart he would string that bow and shoot an arrow through the iron
0	goddess themis , do not question me like this
0	and oil we cleaned your lovely skin
0	zeus , the cloud gatherer , spoke out in response :
0	then rushed up to pull their spears out of the dead
0	her heart cared about him , so she cast around him an amazing mist
0	but my crew , overcome with arrogance ,
0	shame on you lycians !
0	is something i ca not bear
0	you two ajaxes , now you must get your joy protecting us , as you have done before , but even better
0	a plea , especially to eurymachus and godlike antinous , since what he said
0	the first to kill a man was teucer , son of telamon
0	just as a terrifying fire rages through deep woodson a parched mountain , burning dense stands of trees , as the driving wind blows flames to every spot , that how achilles , like a god , raged with his spear , attacking and killing men all through the fight
0	a place whose name no one should ever speak
0	i know machaon , his people 's shepherd
0	athena , goddess with the gleaming eyes , then said to him :
0	we hauled up our ships , took down all the sails , went up along the shore , and fell asleep ,
0	the killing of the suitors
0	who stood apart was the shade of ajax ,
0	she quickly dropped into the wine they were enjoying a drug which eased men 's pains and irritations ,
0	he took this stool , placed it by telemachus ' table , facing him ,
0	in his chest his heart was hoping
0	as far as the first is concerned , the text is largely irrelevant
0	that 's what he wanted , i suppose
0	and this table welcoming your guests ,
0	pylaemenes , a brave soldier , commanded paphlagoniansfrom enetae , where herds of mules run wild , men from cytorus , from around sesamus , those with fine homes by the stream parthenius , from cromna , aegialus , high erithini
0	she gives hope to each of us , makes promises
0	shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
0	the only one who beat me with the bow
0	amphidamas then gave the cap to molus , as a present for his hospitality
0	the gates of heaven scraped open on their own
0	and set the bed up in a different spot
0	just as he was when he went with the troops
0	for there 's nothing more shameless than a wretched stomach ,
0	one would not select any men but these
0	dear phoebus , go down to bronze-armed hector
0	amphimedon 's shade then answered him and said :
0	in her upper room , the daughter of icarius ,
0	each man looked around to see how he might flee complete destruction
0	then father zeus , enthroned on high , put fear in ajax
0	that 's what they would say , and their remarks
0	his sword sliced away his arms and slashed his head off
0	a tear ran down his cheek onto the ground—till then he would held himself in check
0	then athena , goddess with the gleaming eyes ,
0	enraged that you destroyed his dear son 's eye
0	which laertes had once won by his own efforts ,
0	when lord odysseus , who would endured so much , saw her , he was glad and quickly spoke up to telemachus ,
0	but hector killed only one man— periphetes of mycenae , dear son of copreus , who used to take messages from king eurystheusto mighty hercules
0	these the swineherd , a splendid man , had raised himself
0	a name which never should be mentioned
0	i will lie down on the black hollow ship tonight
0	but i will tell you this—remember it well— i will not raise my hand to fight about that girl , no , not against you or any other man
0	my friend , i thought you hada better mind than any other manliving in fertile lycia
0	for i do not think that you were born and raised
0	then he picked up a swift arrow lying by itself
0	i am asking you to follow these instructions—
0	comes to our city
0	then the two of them sat down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree
0	they reached us in the morning , thick as leaves
0	his words had wings :
0	then draw that sharp sword on your thigh and charge , just as if you meant to slaughter her
0	no other man can match the way i serve
0	he was the finest looking man i saw
0	i will try to mediate their endless quarrel
0	whom i left behind
0	give me a swift ship and twenty comrades ,
0	he went to his death with the same tranquility plato describes him showing as he leaves the symposium , the last drinker in the early light of dawn , beginning a new day , while behind him , on the benches and the ground , his sleeping dinner companions stay behind , to dream of socrates the truly erotic man
0	storm-footed iris rushed off with the message
0	telemachus has only just grown up ,
0	my mother picks up from those soothsayers
0	i never met him , never even saw him ,
0	once he would finished speaking ,
0	wine has seized your wits ,
0	i tied the huge creature 's feet together ,
0	and care for him
0	men and horses are all shrouded in this mist
0	zeus sent a favouring wind
0	to take his seat inside the hall and eat his meal beside telemachus
0	odysseus restrained them , kept them in check ,
0	if so , then you are no son of tydeus , the son of warlike oeneus
0	we went to sleep , each man with his weapons , along the river bank
0	with the immense impact of the image , the concept , the ethical teaching , and the sympathetic emotion , the apollinian tears man from his orgiastic self-annihilation and blinds him to the universality of the dionysian process , deluding him into the belief that he is seeing a single image of the world ( tristan and isolde , for instance ) , and that , through music , he is merely supposed to see it still better and more profoundly
0	something sweet to satisfy their hearts , slaughtering
0	first , he set out prizes for swift charioteers— for the winner , a woman skilled in fine handicrafts and a tripod with handles holding twenty measures
0	i could transgress what zeus has ordered
0	we would taken many jars for everyone
0	cutting across this gulf , but i ca not find
0	athena poured beauty on him in large amounts to make him taller , more robust to look at , and on his head she made his hair
0	in this sense , it is precisely the tragic myth that has to convince us that even the ugly and disharmonic are part of an artistic game that the will in the eternal amplitude of its pleasure plays with itself
0	about the anger of the gods or the dining table
0	he went back to the door , sat there ,
0	they brought in godlike telemachus , asking him
0	thus , thoas ruled alone
0	threw him decisively , and all achaeans
0	hector sliced his wrist , and so his fighting ended
0	there were no rocks , and it was sheltered from the wind
0	it 's now the twentieth year since he went off
0	hector was annoyed— his weapon had flown from his hand and missed its mark
0	after being away so long
0	son of atreus , how can such words as thesecome from your mouth ?
0	if he misses the bird and hits the cord , he will be less successful , but he will take as prizethese single-bladed axes
0	i did not learn a thing
0	then from a mountain peak
0	now , you should eat before you leave
0	to the waters of that zeus-fed river ,
0	olympian zeus himself gives happiness to bad and worthy men ,
0	this said , antinous called out to melanthius ,
0	grant that telemachus and i get back ,
0	for he will fight when the spirit in his chest moves him , or when god drives him to it
0	and my two feet
0	that 's what the spirit of teiresias
0	but still , the oath , lambs ' blood , unmixed libations , handshakes , things in which we placed our trust—all these will not go in vain
0	as did telemachus and menelaus , too ,
0	i do not believe there are any mortal men
0	i would met with every hospitality
0	both were keen to get the judgment from an arbitration
0	menelaus found him putting his fine armour on by his ship 's stern
0	at once he asked the loud-voiced heralds to summon all the long-haired achaeans to assembly
0	the man who sent meis honourable but quick to take offence
0	but odysseus returned into the hut
0	at their communal feasts , my own altarnever went without the proper offerings , libations and sacrificial smoke ,
0	this is your life , this is the hand on the clock of your existence
0	grapes are drying in the sun
0	who you give orders to , will take me there ,
0	that 's the man whose people you are now keen to favour
0	he shows us , with his awe-inspiring gestures , how the entire world of torment is necessary , so that through it the individual is pushed to create the redemptive vision and then , absorbed in contemplation of that vision , sits quietly in his rowboat , tossing around in the middle of the ocean
0	so they could wash then beside them she pulled up a polished table
0	nastes led the carians , men with a strange language , from miletus , phthires , with its wooded mountain , maeander 's waters and high peaks of mount mycale
0	achilles served the meat and sat down by the wall , directly opposite godlike odysseus
0	queen hera with her crafty mind then answered zeus :
0	we are from ithaca below mount neion
0	of all the treasured gifts stored in my home ,
0	then godlike theoclymenus addressed them all :
0	then on this grain-giving earth his fame
0	prophesied to me when i descended
0	alcinous then answered him and said :
0	then the daughters of the old man of the sea
0	about the marriage , though i am upset
0	just as a bull grunts when it grazes in a meadow , that how the key 's force made the fine door creak , and it quickly swung ajar
0	men thrashed around , back and forth , as they were sucked down in the current screaming
0	to tell the truth , no greek artist handled his public over a long lifetime with greater daring and self-satisfaction than euripides
0	then answered him and said :
0	once odysseus spoke , the old woman left the room to fetch water for his feet , since what she would had before had all been spilled
0	the gods were not unwilling this man came
0	with what he would said
0	and spoke out to odysseus :
0	of his return—how he came home and then
0	stand by me as you did my father , lord tydeus , at thebes , that time he wentas messenger , sent there by achaeans
0	he bids the other trojans , all achaeans ,
0	a kind reception with the many things
0	my friend , since you are so resolved in your denials ,
0	grazing near the dark-prowed ship
0	prepare yourselves for hard strife , but believe in the miracles of your god
0	but at this point it 's the other people
0	to all those suitors you will appear disgusting ,
0	he was very much afraid for the achaean ships
0	there was no other challenge he could dream up more difficult for me
0	with a shout , he went after them , taking ranks of trojans with him
0	to cook his dinner
0	mycenaeans , willing to comply , agreed
0	that is , in his transformed state he sees a new vision outside himself as an apollonian fulfillment of his condition
0	do you think this is another trick ?
0	you must not look
0	many arcadians came in every ship , skilled fighters
0	all that seem to be something accidental , a reminder of the origin of tragedy which we can well do without , because we have come to realize that the chorus can be understood only as the origin of tragedy and the tragic in general
0	what 's happened now , my friends , has come about
0	all of you sitting here , without heart , disgraced like this , may all of you dissolve , disintegrate to earth and water
0	they followed him , making a huge noise
0	but the life-nourishing earth
0	and now light from the sun would have gone down on them , as they wept , if telemachus had not spoken
0	strange lady , to you those who live on mount olympus
0	i left them and came to troy to fight on foot , relying on my expertise in archery
0	this man here is indeed , as you have said ,
0	you will not be avenged
0	to marry my mother and then possess
0	therefore euripides set up the prologue even before the exposition and put it in the mouth of a person whom people could trust—a divinity would necessarily confirm the outcome of the tragedy for the public , more or less , and take away any doubts about the reality of the myth , in a manner similar to the way in which descartes could establish the reality of the empirical world through an appeal to the truthfulness of god and his inability to lie
0	he proceeded through the house to tell penelope the news
0	after i have looked over my estates
0	i ordered them to quickly fling on board
0	to overcome me when , weak as i am ,
0	inside the house , begging from the people ?
0	it does not get incensed without a reason
0	when he went off to troy
0	eurymachus , polybus ' son , then spoke out in reply :
0	set my hands on the colossal main mast
0	the land behind them was black , looking as though it had just been ploughed , though it was made of gold—an amazing piece of work !
0	i have excellent sons and many soldiers
0	they all helped pick her up , almost dead from shock
0	did not see him as he moved across the city
0	and cunning of a sort we never hear about
0	stranger , since you are keen to reach the city ,
0	on the other side , glorious hector organized his men
0	electrum , silver , ivory—to me
0	with cables on the stern
0	hermes the guide , killer of argus , hearing zeus , did not disobey
0	you insatiable creature , quite shameless
0	charge ahead , you horse-taming trojans
0	and their disgraceful conduct , any man
0	to get some sleep , i will come to collect them
0	and where are your parents ?
0	inside the hall—i would have pleased your heart
0	you heard me earlier , when i prayed to you
0	would have made a tomb for you—for your son
0	next in came the horses driven by antilochus , grandson of neleus , who just beat menelaus— he won by cunning , not by his horses ' speed
0	just as a man constructs a wall for some high house , using well-fitted stones to keep out forceful winds , that 's how close their helmets and bossed shields lined up , shield pressing against shield , helmet against helmet , man against man
0	that 's what they said
0	it stood there , while trojans sat and talked around it , confused what they should do
0	for , more than anyone , i am weighed down
0	since the power in this house is mine
0	yes , my child , may you always think about
0	odysseus finished and then , still wrapped up in his cloak , picked up a hefty discus , bigger than the others , much heavier than the ones used by phaeacians
0	my loyal crewmates quickly pulled out wax
0	then priam , descendant of dardanus , addressed them all :
0	i sent him ahead with my noble comrades ,
0	so shut your mouth
0	the centaur , in brave perithous ' house ,
0	wise penelope then answered him :
0	for , in fact , gods make themselves appear
0	or for heralds who do the people 's work
0	hides crept along the ground , while on the spits the meat began to bellow , and a sound
0	to sell me off for an enormous profit
0	the fight between centaurs and men began
0	only deïphobus and brave helenushave gone back , both wounded in the arm—hit by a long spear—but zeus saved them from death
0	however , if we ask ourselves to indicate , briefly and without claiming to say anything in detail , what euripides might have in common with menander and philemon and what was so excitingly exemplary and effective for them in euripides , it is enough to say that the spectator in euripides is brought up onto the stage
0	first i got out from underneath its gut
0	but as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared , they hurried to the ship and loaded on the bronze , which strengthens men
0	if you have ever loved my father , stood by his side in murderous combat , be my friend now
0	and your heart 's satisfied , you can tell me
0	they then reached the lofty hut of peleus ' son , which myrmidons had built there for their king , cutting pine beams for it , then roofing it with downy reedsgathered from the meadows
0	they bear no young and never die
0	we are afraid of yet—not telemachus ,
0	so go now , challenge war-loving menelausto fight again in single combat
0	well , nobody , i will eat all your companions before you
0	achilles then stood up , and addressed the argives :
0	may hera 's loud-thundering husband , zeus ,
0	as the stone sank , the sea surged under it , waves pushed us back
0	no doubt here in these halls you have often prayed that my goal of a sweet return would stay
0	you have now won my heart , though it 's been truly stubborn
0	keep it in mind
0	whose mind has had all sense knocked out of it
0	alcinous , it 's not at all appropriate
0	when you are bowed down with a ripe old age , and your people prospering around you
0	cyclops , take this wine and drink it , now you have had your meal of human flesh , so you may know
0	as this was happening , on a peak of mount olympus hera of the golden throne was standing watching
0	some god will overcome those noble suitors ,
0	his words stirred up athena , who was already keen
0	but the reply they heard was harsh
0	cadmus ' daughter , once a mortal being with human speech , but now , deep in the sea , she was leucothea
0	tlepolemus raised his ash spear high
0	a skillful artisan whom pallas athena
0	he directed them right at the fire , then told them to start working
0	do not show contempt for what they have to say or insult their coming here
0	where they held public debates
0	though not too many people live on it ,
0	against these men , after he got back ?
0	our ship sailed on , away from ocean 's stream ,
0	what sorrow nowhas come into your heart ?
0	and there is no one there to help him
0	inside that well-decked ship
0	his son , the warrior antiphus , had sailed to troy , that horse-rich city , along with lord odysseus ,
0	go there , heroic man , and follow my instructions—
0	my friends , leaders and rulers of argives , am i the only one to see those horses , or can you glimpse them , too ?
0	mentor , help fight off disaster
0	as his mind thought it through , the latter course of action seemed the better choice , to clasp the knees of laertes ' son , odysseus
0	when they would enjoyed their food , the girl and her attendants threw their head scarves off to play catch with a ball , and white-armed nausicaa led them in song
0	now , see if you can cope with my bronze point
0	to cry for any mortal man who 's died
0	but the great man cebriones , proud of his glory , just lay there in the swirling dust , his horsemanship now quite forgotten
0	when they saw that , they were happy—in all their chests the spirits filled with joy
0	but you are older
0	or any noise from men within these walls ,
0	he wants to see you and get your advice ,
0	once he would said this , peisistratus drove his horses ,
0	and on the tomb there fix the oar i used
0	he sang about the various ways those warriors
0	more so than other men
0	ask me questions about anything except
0	for now we fight ourselves , arguing like this
0	her scheme did not go well
0	for you , too , are made of mortal stuff
0	and grandsons of great hercules had threatened him
0	and have no knowledge of ships painted red or well-made oars that serve those ships as wings
0	the many epeians on board were commanded by amphimachus , son of cteatus , and thalpius , son of eurytus , descended both from actor
0	good ones , too , could not have shifted it
0	he shuddered , for he perceived how high-thundering zeus was denying completely all his fighting skill , wanting the trojans to prevail
0	but all by himself he 's snatched a bodyfrom the trojans and gone off with it
0	still sucking on the teat , not yet broken
0	not one of them dared look directly at those weapons
0	and as myth died with you , so died the genius of music as well
0	inside the high-roofed house , with his noble wife , who had prepared the bed , lying down beside him
0	had seemed the best
0	he 's taking a huge stash of glorious loot—
0	each of them in turn , standing by the boat
0	alas , this is great sorrow for achaeans
0	more beautiful , as well
0	for as long as he 's alive , i do not think
0	she died a wretched death
0	speeds on her way , then turn her into stone
0	looking down from pergamus , apollo grew annoyed
0	the best man brings up his sure-footed horsesin last place
0	so i can lie down by myself
0	the goddesses moved stealthily , like wild pigeons , eager to assist the argive troops
0	since my husband 's now been so long absent
0	this beast from the gods reached oeneus ' orchardand was causing serious damage there , knocking tall plants to the ground , entire trees , including roots and flowering apples
0	since lord odysseus is dead , but i
0	the swift arrows tumbled out
0	so he asked zeus what plan he had in mind :
0	eumaeus and the rest of you , his work mates ,
0	two rails run round it
0	so it must be the case that the fine sonof menoetius is dead , that reckless man
0	if i had power , i would defend myself ,
0	and fill your stomach
0	promise apollo , illustrious archer born in lycia , you will make fine sacrifice , some new-born lambs , once you get back to your city , holy zeleia
0	whose voice is like a god 's
0	young men have , who then seek judgment ,
0	they lack all discretion , all sense of justice ,
0	in her grief over her brothers ’ killing , she prayed to the gods , beating fertile earthwith her hands over and over , kneeling down , her breasts wet from crying , begging hades and fearful persephone to kill her son
0	but now , in my mind , i have got this dreadful fear that thetis , silver-footed daughter of the old man of the sea , has won you over , for this morning early , she sat down beside you , held your knees
0	have a pleasant dinner in odysseus ' home
0	i chose two of my men
0	and then i noticed mighty hercules ,
0	with countless fine things set before him
0	he has no peers
0	across my shoulder , grabbed my bow , and told him to take me back there on the selfsame trail
0	i found my trusty comrades at the ship
0	should end it themselves
0	once the thighs had been completely burned and they would sampled innards ,
0	among the cyclopes , grain-bearing earth grows clusters of rich grapes , which zeus ' rain increases , but this drink—
0	your attendant 's weak , your horses slow
0	but apollo himself stirred up aeneas , taking on the form of periphas , the herald , son of epytos , who would grown old serving as herald to aeneas ' old father
0	the divine hair on the king of gods fell forward , down over his immortal head , shaking olympus to its very base
0	stranger , since you ask me questions about this , stay quiet , enjoy yourself , drink your wine ,
0	this pressure and the rays of helios ,
0	take their fast horses out of harness ,
0	i say it 's better to be slaughtering wild beasts , deer in the mountains , than to fight all outwith those more powerful
0	nothing 's more miserable for human beings
0	a constant din arosearound great nestor and warlike idomeneus
0	to stand her ground was alcinous ' daughter
0	danaans poured out from among the ships throughout the constant uproar
0	a practical pessimism , which could give rise to a dreadful ethic of mass murder out of sympathy , such a belief is present and was present all over the world , wherever art did not appear in some form or other , especially in religion and science , as a remedy and a defense against that pestilence
0	she spoke , and her eyes glanced over at penelope , anxious to tell her that her husband had come home
0	having said this , swift-footed iris went away
0	for my mind is just , and inside my chest
0	shades of the dead—brides , young unmarried men ,
0	some god breaks me apart , i will go on—
0	he despises you , your gifts , and tells youto think for yourself with the argiveshow you may save achaean ships and men
0	trojans could not break through , get past danaan ranks to assault the ships and huts
0	fully armed , he quickly jumped down from his chariot to the ground
0	on a raft of wood well lashed together
0	excited by their master 's shout , his horses ran on even faster
0	nor any mortal men
0	bright-eyed athena smiled and stroked him with her hand
0	he 's a child no longer
0	the fast horses swerved
0	let them love each other as they used to do ,
0	is no doubt done for
0	while we were occupied with all these tasks , circe was well aware of our return
0	he changed the armour so it suited hector 's body
0	you have not been a fool
0	and stop them drinking dark blood all at once
0	warmer water to it
0	the men dispersed , each man to his own house
0	without being favoured by the gods
0	the first shade to appear out of the pit was my companion elpenor , whose corpse
0	then i gave orders we should leave on foot—
0	his fair share of the trophies with him
0	as they embarked , i observed their leader ,
0	would tell agamemnon , son of atreus ,
0	so come now , give him the polished bow ,
0	each suitor , quite astonished , would glance at the man beside him and then mutter words like these :
0	he escaped your throw all on his own
0	he saw both ajaxes , so keen for war , standing there
0	with his spear , aeneas then struck down leocritus , son of arisbas , the courageous companion of lycomedes
0	he would broken in his well-built home in eleon
0	and apollo , far-shooting god , make hector
0	once he would roasted them completely , he picked them up and , without taking out the spits , carried them still hot over to odysseus
0	three times i poured some out and gave it to him ,
0	the finest of all fattened hogs for them to eat
0	let it be your treasure , in memory of patroclus ' burial
0	lady , we have not yet come
0	it 's hard for me , though i am a powerful man , to attackso many men and battle with them all
0	but in the morning let us all assemble ,
0	the two of us wo not say goodbye , until
0	renowned odysseus , great glory of achaeans , tell me how you two obtained these horses
0	in his fury with the suitors , those men
0	lycaon 's fine son then said in reply :
0	that what i said
0	so you must leave this island with all speed
0	if i threw , if my bronze spear hit youin the middle of your body , then no matterwhat your courage , or how much trust you placein your strong hands , you would quickly give me glory , and your life to famous horseman hades
0	then phoebus apollo spoke out to achilles :
0	with these words , nestor hurried through the ditch
0	who leaned back and fell asleep
0	then you would know the kind of strength i have
0	but he came back and , sitting on a beam
0	or have they died and gone to hades ' home ?
0	i did many reckless things
0	down to my swift ship and to my comrades
0	for i get such astonishing delight
0	now that you have all finished eating ,
0	a moment to look forward to
0	could i somehow be
0	brought us disaster—he made that our fate ,
0	do you think the blame rests with your kinsmen ,
0	to your well-built home and native land
0	for the armies of horse-taming trojans and achaeans had only just begun to march against each other
0	or perhaps in sparta with menelaus
0	and what about morality itself ?
0	for the gods were with us when we came
0	keep silent for the moment , in case one of our achaeans hears you
0	twisted it around—just as a shipwright
0	i will kill you , and you will pass through hades ' gate
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	well now , this is strange indeed—to my home has come
0	but the beast got the jump on him and struck him above the knee , charging at him from the side , a long gash in his flesh sliced by its tusk , but it did not reach odysseus ' bone
0	even in my dreams
0	i do not , nor do the others here with me
0	and above all , it is through music that the tragic spectator is overcome by an assured premonition of a highest pleasure attained through destruction and negation , so he feels as if the innermost abyss of things spoke to him perceptibly
0	then cloud-gatherer zeus , irritated , said to her :
0	rouse danaansto battle hard
0	he would been there , on watch , for one whole year , just in case agamemnon should succeed in getting back
0	his loyal companions retrieved it
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered her and said :
0	so they immediately got up and went away
0	the life of ajax , such a splendid man ,
0	aeneas cowered down , holding the shield out away from him in terror
0	i fathered sons , the best in spacious troy
0	i have returned here in the twentieth year ,
0	because he is unable to behold a vision , he forces the machinist and the decorative artist into his service
0	mighty agamemnon then speared him in the side
0	but when he sawbarbs of the arrow head , its binding , still outside , not underneath the skin , his spirits rose , and courageflowed back into his chest
0	then his lovely wife , in a quarrel over who should get credit for first wounding the great wild boar , meleager had killed his mother ’ s brothers
0	at other times i have held back from war , but not this time
0	but athena approached odysseus , laertes ' son , and urged him to collect bread from the suitors , so he might find out those who did respect the law and those who flouted their traditions
0	eurymachus , all you other noble suitors , no longer
0	they washed , rubbing lots of smooth oil on themselves , then sat down to eat
0	she stood beside the door post of the well-built room and , holding a bright veil across her countenance ,
0	i would died as well and met my fate that day
0	once xanthus had said this , the erinyes removed his voice
0	or perhaps a stranger did—odysseus
0	by what you have said
0	and kissed life-giving earth
0	and to the outer limits of the earth—
0	the first drops for libations
0	now he plans a cruel trick , tells me to return to argos dishonoured , after i have lost so many warriors
0	once we would made it past those rocks and fled ,
0	with her lovely voice calypso sang inside the cave , as she moved
0	zeus seated himself upon his throne
0	he sat down behind odysseus and pulled the arrow from his foot
0	in their hollow ship have carried away
0	when hera spoke , hephaestus extinguished his stupendous fire at once
0	geranian horseman nestor led these menin a flotilla of ninety hollow ships
0	and then murdered him , once the man came home
0	but my heart is torn
0	but as the days and months went by , bringing
0	stranger , you look different to me than you did before—
0	do not let forgetfulness seize your mind , when honey sleep has loosed his sweet grip on you
0	it protected heads of brave young men
0	that one of them can not still somehow
0	i choose with care and then deliver them
0	the instantaneous , the witty , the foolish , and the capricious—these are its loftiest divinities , the fifth state , that of the slave ( or at least the feelings of a slave ) now come to rule
0	then medon , an intelligent man , said to her :
0	my child , do not blame her now about such things
0	the richly woven garments she herself had made
0	i myself will look at them
0	so both gods lay there , on the all-nourishing earth
0	it would be inappropriate for me
0	here on this sea-girt island , we could make
0	where i moored my curving ships
0	many shady mountains and the roaring sea stand there between us
0	menestheus , son of peteos , led these men
0	that fame you haveas a courageous warrior is misplaced
0	more than any other of his comrades—
0	hector then called out to peleus ' noble son :
0	shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
0	anchises ' strong son was not unwilling
0	about my lady , although servants have
0	my sharp bronze , i think , can slice up his flesh , too
0	to them this feminine flight from seriousness and terror , this cowardly self-satisfaction with comfortable consumption , seemed not only despicable but also the essentially anti-christian frame of mind
0	he was dreadfully afraid
0	off to sacred pylos and holy sparta
0	they have taught you all sorts of things with horses , so there 's no need to issue you instructions
0	people call this star by the name orion 's dog
0	the gods bring miseries to wandering men ,
0	will be returning home has been wiped out
0	and do not let your mind and heart
0	but from the others i will not back away ,
0	for now—and i say this because you asked—
0	how this matter can best resolve itself
0	squandering a fine man 's property and then
0	telemachus , the gods themselves , it seems , are teaching you to be a braggart
0	and their demonstration diagnosed for the first time the illusory notion which pretends to be able to fathom the innermost essence of things with the aid of causality
0	the fourth brought water in ,
0	you scampered off , down mount ida 's slopes , and quickly , too
0	in our house we honored him just as we didour parents
0	son of tydeus , what 's the matter with us ?
0	weeping , they picked the white bones of their comrade out and put them in a double layer of fat inside a golden urn
0	as a result of euripides , the man of ordinary life pushed his way out of the spectators ' space and up onto the acting area
0	and pick me something truly beautiful
0	achilles , when he saw him , jumped out and roared in triumph :
0	the fleet was soon prepared
0	this was poetry 's new position , the place into which plato forced it under the influence of the daemonic socrates
0	now i will describe for you each and every one of circe ’ s fatal ploys
0	the day that you will return
0	things to grieve about
0	he instructed him to take them to the hollow ships
0	my dear child , things are indeed just as you say
0	but i would like to ask you , my good man ,
0	we came to tenedos and sacrificed
0	not when he rises into starry heaven ,
0	he makes me tremble—i am so afraid
0	but if you harm them , then i foresee destruction for your ship
0	trojans must be timid men
0	he went off and , standing beside odysseus ,
0	i ran out straight ahead ,
0	odysseus , a man of many schemes , then answered her and said :
0	they asked me and famous idomeneus
0	with spear-fighter peisistratus , leader of men ,
0	the same ship brought us here
0	with no work skills or strength , just a burden
0	have planned something disastrous
0	with their mistress and find out everything ,
0	zeus spoke and then instructed hermes , his dear son :
0	he comes by birth from a good father
0	to wear fresh garments on your person
0	and they would had a taste of inner organs ,
0	inside the doorway with a fearful glare
0	that 's how terrible his resolution is
0	but the shaker of the earth had not forgotten
0	what i was looking for
0	just as a leopard emerges from thick undergrowth , to face a hunter , with no fear in its heart ,
0	to the gods , and portion out the land for farming
0	making libations to honour keen-eyed hermes ,
0	without a lively pathological interest , he says , i , too , have never yet succeeded in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind , and hence i have rather avoided than sought it
0	and then into a serpent and a leopard ,
0	limb from limb , right here
0	menelaus and aeneas , now faced each other , with eager hands and spears , ready to begin the fight
0	addressing each of them in turn , he ordered them to pray to all the gods
0	for being so angry
0	worn out in war , i reach my ships with something fine but small
0	at once he saw a shameful sight— achaeans in retreat , pushed back by their enemies , high-hearted trojans
0	antinous , it 's quite impossible for me to eat
0	he said these words , to hold down the heart within his chest , and his spirit submitted , enduring everything with resolution
0	idomeneus had come from the curving ships that day on foot and would have given the trojans a great triumph , if coeranus had not quickly driven up with his swift-footed horses
0	athena spoke , and much-enduring lord odysseus
0	talked to them with reassuring words and said :
0	the brutal fight began again among the ships
0	then he would scatter this presumption ,
0	when they would satisfied their need for food and drink , then priam , son of dardanus , looked at achilles , wondering at his size and beauty , like gazingface to face upon a god
0	poseidon , sent at me
0	or bring back word to us—they wished to stay ,
0	until death 's black cloud came to embrace us
0	first , he set up the axes
0	once i would made it over to the gateway
0	the island where fair-haired calypso lives ,
0	the hospitality i give my guests
0	kept talking to each other
0	they would gone off to gather large rocks for the wall around the vineyard , with the old man in the lead
0	with these words , eurymachus pulled out his sword , a sharp two-edged blade of bronze , and then charged out straight at odysseus , with a blood-curdling shout
0	deadly things , so horrible to others
0	you will steer your ship at it , illustrious odysseus
0	and my intelligence , if you dine here ,
0	mighty earthshaker , what strange things you say !
0	then we will collect bones from patroclus , menoetius ' son , separating them with carefrom all the rest
0	as she went back and forth before her loom ,
0	but if we are
0	now , if all those of us who protect danaans were to agree to drive the trojans back , we would leave wide-seeing zeus up there by himself , sulking where he sits alone on ida
0	that would be the cause of some disgrace
0	you gods are cruel and vindictive
0	bloodstained ares ' long spear struck it
0	in case someone robs me and removes it
0	in a mighty lion 's den and then gone roaming
0	like plato , he assigned it to the art of cosmetics , which present only a pleasant surface , not the useful , and he therefore demanded that his disciples abstain and stay away from such unphilosophical temptations , with so much success that the young poet of tragedy , plato , immediately burned his poetical writing in order to be able to become socrates 's student
0	grieving for dear shipmates we had lost ,
0	that made the beggar irus angry , so he said :
0	then go back to your ship with your spirit
0	and give her to the man he feels he likes ,
0	so the gods , givers of good things , stood in the doorway , looking at the artful work of ingenious hephaestus
0	there are plenty of achaean women in hellas and in phthia—daughters of lords , men who govern cities
0	by attacking us , these trojans were the first to violate their oaths
0	but poseidon did not laugh
0	helios , i think you should keep on shining for immortals
0	as i was remembering odysseus ,
0	then they could storm heaven
0	father zeus will never help those liars
0	telemachus walked away to the ocean shore
0	hence , they lack blood , and men call them immortal
0	the spirits , ghosts of the dead , keep me away
0	to make me groan and grieve still more ?
0	with both his hands he pulled up the purple cloak to hide his eyes
0	at this speech argives gave out an enormous cheer
0	with her own hands she combed her shining locks in braids , a stunning style for an immortal goddess
0	i had twelve ships with me , and each of them
0	although of all the gods who hold olympus
0	every time he tried to dash for the dardanian gates to get underneath the walls , so men on top could come to his assistance by hurling spears , achilles would intercept him and turn him back towards the plain , always making sure he kept running a line between hector and the city
0	the keen-eyed killer of argus told him
0	all those men as much as i do one man ,
0	telemachus , this bird flying to our right
0	once she would raised them , their royal mother
0	in astonishment he turned
0	with himwent teucer , his brother , both from the same father
0	but zeus , grant me now at least this prayer—let us get out of here alive , in safety
0	shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
0	some of our people who saw that island
0	first , let your eyes inspect this scar—a boar
0	that was the man
0	to me to have good sense , so act as follows—
0	to stop their slurs , their insults , you wo not let them wash your feet
0	and your mind 's unfeeling
0	for you love war , constant strife and battle
0	for zeus , son of cronos , has not given
0	deïphobus , son of priam , moved out before them , full of ambitious hopes
0	there are none left for us to pass around
0	release my dear child to me
0	than going on foot , because the washing tubs
0	as he approached , odysseus , his father , got up
0	as you visit the farms , while those others ,
0	while at home aegisthus planned the murder
0	but he struck his chest and said , as a rebuke to his own heart :
0	the robes and sashes
0	once that goes , no matter how keen a man may be , he can no longer continue in the war
0	but aeneas was not their sole commander
0	and by trading filled their hollow ship with goods
0	then pallas athena gave diomedes , son of tydeus , strength and courage , so among all argives , he would stand out and win heroic glory
0	bolt and lash them shut
0	in this totally strange character instinctive wisdom reveals itself only in order to confront the conscious knowledge now and then as an impediment
0	right now they shake with fear in front of you , like bleating goats confronted by a lion
0	then a third one joined them , philoetius , an outstanding man , bringing in
0	so autolycus then answered her and said :
0	meanwhile , a herald brought him
0	as dawn rose from her bed beside lord tithonus , bringing light to immortal gods and men alike , zeus sent strife down to the fast achaean ships , the savage goddess , carrying the sign of war
0	after saying this , achilles ordered automedon , his close companion , to fetch the breastplate from the hut
0	the gods charged off to battle , their hearts divided in two groups
0	entertain any further nasty words
0	i do not know if some god was urging him
0	where there 's an old debt they still owe me ,
0	but perhaps some god will inspire the hearts in both your chests , so you two can stand firm
0	but come , i will tell you
0	where are deïphobus , brave prince helenus , adamas , son of asius , and asius , son of hyrtacus ?
0	my queen , i wish that what you have just described were the worst of it
0	at once to the woman 's quarters in disgrace
0	the fine leather strap stretched round paris ' soft neck , right below his chin , was strangling him to death
0	they ’ d drawn their ships on shore beside the blue-gray sea ,
0	odysseus then made this entreaty :
0	give me strength , so i can call my lycian comrades , urge them on to war ,
0	already in sophocles the chorus reveals itself as something of an embarrassment , an important indication that even with him the dionysian stage of tragedy was beginning to fall apart
0	and brought them to ithaca , where laertes
0	you are achaean women , not warriors
0	the people then had trouble restraining the old man in his frantic grief , his desperate wish to go through the dardanian gate
0	at parnassus , where i keep my property ,
0	all those other men , the noble suitors ,
0	across the stone threshold
0	he stood above my head and spoke these words : 'you are sleeping , son of fiery atreus , tamer of horses
0	but come now , listen to me
0	for with the paphlagonians he would welcomed paris as his guest
0	do we know , my divinely cherished menelaus ,
0	you tell me to end my cries and suffering ,
0	fare you well , o queen , through all your years , until old age and death arrive , the fate
0	i will be looking like a beggar ,
0	penelope was quiet—no winged words flew from her
0	well , once we would left troy , we sailed together ,
0	that famous spearman meges , son of phyleus , coming up close , drove a sharp spear in his neck , into the nape behind his head
0	were busy in the hall , children of springs ,
0	insults me later on—among the people
0	people should have expelled him beyond the borders as something enigmatic , unclassifiable , and inexplicable , so that some future world could not justly charge the athenians with acting shamefully
0	his words had wings :
0	the sensation of this contrast , this game back and forth , is basically what expresses itself in the totality of the song and what , in general , creates the lyrical state
0	once goatherd melanthius said this , he climbed a flight of stairs inside the palace , up to odysseus ' storerooms
0	she found helen in her room , weaving a large cloth , a double purple cloak , creating pictures of the many battle scenes between horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans , wars they suffered for her sake at the hands of ares
0	the bloody limb fell on the ground
0	standing around you , the danaans wept ,
0	prepare yourselfto shoot a swift arrow at menelaus
0	far from the city , or else on the road
0	for my heart 's on fireto help trojans , who really miss me when i am gone
0	and speak the truth—did you see any comrades ,
0	you were pre-eminent among all men
0	so do not give our fathers honours high as mine
0	you could tell me something of his death ,
0	when the two of them
0	i was not attacked and killed in my own home by gentle arrows of the keen-eyed archer ,
0	he will be worse off , and , with these men here ,
0	do not let me offend you , king menelaus
0	the son of crooked-minded cronos gave youa two-edged gift—he gave you honourto govern all men with your sceptre , but he did not give the strongest power , courage
0	eumaeus spoke and offered to eternal gods
0	from the essence of art as it is commonly understood according to the single categories of illusion and beauty it is genuinely impossible to derive the tragic
0	so dismiss them from the pyre for now
0	soon enough , they would be running back , filling the gullieswith their dead , if mighty agamemnon treated me with kindness—but now they fightall through our camp
0	once those two had seen it
0	of course , set apart from all the rash hopes and the defective practical applications to present times with which i then ruined my first book , the great dionysian question mark remains still standing , as it is set out there ( also in relation to music ) : how should a music be created which is no longer romantic in origin ( like the german ) but dionysian ?
0	in the meantime , i have a dreadful fear that flies may burrowin those wounds carved by the slicing bronzeinto the body of menoetius ' noble son
0	i will wrinkle fine skin on your supple limbs ,
0	who knew all there was to know about great exploits
0	all through cephallenia , to every city
0	to many others here in sunny ithaca
0	when they returned , thanks to the deviousness
0	once they would enjoyed these contests ,
0	yet his fond heart thinks it 's all right to claimequality with me , whom all others fear
0	warlike thrasymedes gave a two-edged sword to the son of tydeus , for he would left his own beside the ships , and a shield as well
0	my son , it 's good to pay immortal godswhat 's due to them
0	that in the same age , even among the same people , this passion for a half-musical mode of speech should awaken alongside of the vaulted structure of palestrina harmonics which all medieval christendom had been building up , i can explain to myself only by a cooperating , extra-artistic tendency in the essence of the recitative
0	back to my native land
0	meriones , you are a lovely dancer , but if my spear had hit you , your dancing dayswould have ended for all time to come
0	laid waste that lofty city and how odysseus ,
0	i sat on them
0	as long as the men had red wine and bread ,
0	through mountain fields and grassy valleys
0	when they did those things
0	as telemachus ' comrades were approaching land ,
0	gazing up to heaven , he poured out some wine , then spoke aloud , saying :
0	there will be in this district good reports
0	though small , is welcome
0	for i do not believe , once he comes here ,
0	his black earth is rich
0	of his murderous wife
0	tell me about it , and be frank
0	fearful , difficult , and fierce—not someone
0	ares , ares , you bloodstained man-killer , ca not you return to diomedes
0	after he had killed the son of atreus ,
0	and keep striking them against the surging sea
0	he was the fastest runner of all those
0	not unless you , goddess , would undertake
0	you are a welcome and respected guest , but to this pointyou have not come by very much
0	mighty alcinous then said to arete :
0	on its end hebe tied the cross-piece , lovely gold , then fixed the golden collar straps
0	with a shining silver cord he lashed that bag
0	just as before , breaking his heart with tears and groans , full of sorrow , as he looked out on the restless sea and wept
0	my heart understands them , all the details ,
0	playing on the shore , and she was with them ,
0	when i first saw you
0	father zeus , ruling from mount ida , most glorious , most powerful , and you , too , god of the sun , who sees everything , hears everything , you rivers , earth , you gods below the earth , who punish the dead when men swear false oaths , you gods are witnesses
0	and his people , trying to save his children
0	i chose two men , with a third as herald
0	for a swift ship , and he was happy to oblige
0	agenor then bound up his hand in a strip of twisted sheep 's wool and made a sling , which his attendant carried for him , his people 's shepherd
0	do not you see that long-haired achaeanshave built a new wall to protect their ships , dug a ditch around it , and yet have madeno splendid sacrifice to us , the gods ?
0	me , i don ’ t want to stay here in my hut
0	either through the influence of narcotic drink , of which all primitive men and peoples speak , or through the powerful coming on of spring , which drives joyfully through all of nature , that dionysian excitement arises
0	a friend 's persuasion perhaps can do some good
0	child of zeus , invincible goddess , hear me
0	or leap up and dance
0	then she led him on a path
0	when the two were close , within each other 's range , agamemnon threw and missed—his spear turned aside
0	but you did come to a kind man 's house
0	i say to him—do not be afraid of death ,
0	to provide this stranger with a dinner
0	and in despair he spoke to his great heart :
0	i will discuss no plans with him , no actions
0	the city 's main defense , the best by far
0	to stay there by the ship and guard it ,
0	odysseus lay down there
0	we suspect that the birth of tragedy can not be explained either from the high estimation of the moral intelligence of the masses or from the idea of the spectator without a play
0	that 's how the leaders and commanders of the myrmidons rushed around brave patroclus ,
0	now , of course , alongside this single recognition , excessively truthful and brave , stands a profound but delusive image , which first came into the world in the person of socrates , that unshakeable faith that thinking , guided by the idea of causality , might reach into the deepest abyss of being , and that thinking is capable of , not just understanding being , but even correcting it
0	she bore her husband splendid children—
0	and dogs , as well
0	we must look after him , for every stranger ,
0	silver-footed thetis then said to achilles :
0	when a man 's in need , they say that shame
0	odysseus then sat down
0	to hear the fate of argives and danaans ,
0	anything more insignificant than man
0	inside the hut they would butchered a large woolly sheep
0	in your own home , trojans treated youexceptionally well , did they not ?
0	saying this , she hurried through the house , heart pounding ,
0	brought in bread and set it there before me ,
0	noble theoclymenus then said in reply :
0	tydeus had a son not much like his father
0	soon enough you will learn
0	and spoke to her—his words had wings :
0	before now , trojans never wished to standconfronting the fierce fighting powerof achaean arms , not even for a moment
0	i will offer her to you with gold-wrapped horns
0	it hit democoön , priam 's bastard son , who would come from abydos , where he bred horses for their speed
0	forty black ships in his flotilla
0	but now you would be quite happy looking onif ten achaean groups were fighting here with ruthless bronze before your very eyes
0	divinely raised scamander , it shall beas you request
0	heroic leitus knocked down phylacus , as he was fleeing
0	over the waves and carried them to egypt ,
0	the very best thing for you is totally unreachable : not to have been born , not to exist , to be nothing
0	they do not control their horses
0	he took three paces—with the fourth he reached his goal , aegae , where his famous palace had been built of eternal gold and marble deep within the sea
0	for odysseus will not be away for long
0	he will not lie , for he is far too wise
0	once he would made it back , carrying the weapons , as quickly as he could
0	standing close to him , talthybius spoke
0	and yearly seasons rolled around once more ,
0	but apollo did not let him win the glory there
0	and tell the steward
0	so we achaean sons fought there nine years ,
0	on his handsome head he put a fine helmet with nodding horse-hair plumes on top , full of menace
0	but the gods are still preventing him
0	who was coming closer , argus wagged his tail
0	wise penelope then answered him :
0	i claim that sacred right , my lord , because it was at your tablei first ate demeter 's grain the very dayyou seized me in that well-built orchard
0	zeus ' bright eyes never onceglanced from that brutal combat , gazing down and thinking in his heart of many different things about how lord patroclus ought to meet his death , wondering whether glorious hector should cut him downwith his bronze in that bitter fighting there over godlike sarpedon and then strip the armour from his shoulders , or whether he should multiply grim misery for still more men
0	achaeans held firm around menoetius ' son , united by a common spirit , behind a fence of their bronze shields
0	lame , wrinkled , cross-eyed , they try to follow
0	many other danaan counselors
0	in case those men have a head start on us
0	with this knowledge in mind , we must understand greek tragedy as the dionysian chorus which over and over again constantly discharges itself in an apollonian world of images
0	looking like artemis or golden aphrodite
0	so drink your wine
0	that 's what 's best now
0	and from this contrast , greek tragedy perished as a work of art
0	as for you , you both were trembling in your shining limbseven before you looked on any fightor witnessed first-hand war 's destructiveness
0	that 's how my shipmates , once they saw me , thronged around , weeping—in their hearts it felt as if they they would got back to their native land , the rugged town of ithaca itself ,
0	no doubt , a man can suffer lossof someone even closer than a friend—a brother born from the same motheror even a son
0	she found him there , still mourning endlessly
0	but when priam 's towering city was destroyed
0	after he would revived and his spirit came once more into his chest , laertes spoke again and said :
0	he shook his head in silence , making cruel plans deep in his heart
0	weigh down his heart , just the way my spirit
0	eurymachus , my father 's journey back to ithaca
0	as far off shore as a hollow ship can sail in one whole day , when a fine stiff breeze
0	or did hostile forces on the mainland kill you off , while you were taking cattle
0	directly to your and your mother 's home ?
0	old woman , those who have seen the two of us
0	ordering them to put their oars to work ,
0	grain-giving earth had raised them up to be
0	xanthus , why do you prophesy my death ?
0	and while music thus compels us to see more and more profoundly than usual , and we see the action on the stage as a delicate web , the world of the stage is expanded infinitely and illuminated for our spiritualized eye
0	to share a goddess ’ bed , if you want her
0	the girls picked up the clothing from the wagon , carried it in their arms down to the murky water , and trampled it inside the washing trenches ,
0	but then the son of atreus ' team slowed down and fell behind , reined in deliberately , in case the sure-footed teams somehow collided and overturned their well-sprung chariots in the road , leaving their drivers , for all their eagerness to win , sprawling in the dust
0	atreus ' son ordered troops to cleanse themselves
0	inside the shining bronze
0	at the same time we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age simply means a return to itself of the german spirit , a blessed self-rediscovery after powerful intrusive influences had for a long time compelled it , living as it did in a helpless and unchaste barbarism , to servitude under their form
0	the greek artist , in particular , in looking back on these divinities , felt a dark sense of reciprocal dependency
0	then athena , the bright-eyed goddess , answered him :
0	after many years—that 's how nestor
0	tydeus was not a man to shirk like this
0	eurynome spread a cloak on him , once he lay down to rest
0	at the sight , black night eclipsed her eyes
0	to hades , so now geranian horseman nestor ,
0	he stirred odysseus ' heart
0	if by the ships right now we were namingthe best men for an ambush , where one seesa warrior 's courage most conspicuously , where cowards and brave men truly show themselves—for a coward 's colour always changes , the man ’ s so nervous he just can ’ t sit still , shifting around , resting first on one foot , then another , heart pounding in his chest , his mind preoccupied with thoughts of death , and his teeth keep chattering in his mouth , while a brave man 's colour never changes ,
0	so although he may be absent ,
0	he was destroyed by fateand by malicious hera 's anger , too
0	not like men at all , but giants
0	once they would piled up the mound , they went back in , gathered together for a splendid feast , all in due order , in priam 's house , king raised by zeus
0	his noble wife , but not once did he have sex with her , because he wanted to avoid annoying his wife
0	concealed in mist and clouds , without a fear
0	was weeping , too , in another spot , once he saw
0	their beaks jabbing deep inside his guts
0	but i am completely doomed to misery , for i fathered the best sons in spacious troy , yet i say now not one of them remains
0	one by one , as the god rained arrows downthroughout the wide achaean army
0	many of his companions mourned around him
0	we just sat—wind and helmsman held the course
0	for a beggar man
0	but that emphatic tradition speaks here against schegel
0	from a long way off , if he wanted to
0	then athena removed the strange cloudy mist and cleared their eyes , so on both sides light streamed in , back to the ships and out towards the battle groups
0	father zeus , are not you angry with aresfor killing off those warriors ?
0	all the things you have determined in your mind
0	will not proceed the way we want it to
0	so we lay down and slept
0	falling to his knees , warlike aeneas stayed down , supporting himself with his strong hand on the ground
0	and then , you fight over me in person with your bronze
0	grant that i come to the phaeacians
0	noble penelope then left and went upstairs
0	she approached the hut , appearing like a woman ,
0	the architecture of the scene appears as an illuminated picture of a cloud , which the bacchae gaze upon , as they swarm down from the mountain heights , as the majestic setting in the middle of which the image of dionysus is revealed
0	odysseus grinned at nestor and answered him :
0	across the waves he raced , just like a cormorant , which hunts for fish down in the perilous gulfs
0	phaeacia 's best , had walked along to watch the games
0	she had a huge loom set up in her rooms
0	to someone else , and with impunity ,
0	for we both understand what shrewdness means
0	my neck was broken ,
0	with lots of men aboard and loaded down
0	they went straight to splendid menelaus ' palace
0	while slaughtering the men
0	great telamonian ajax then answered teucer :
0	at the end of his drama , euripides once again made use of this same divine truthfulness in order to confirm his hero 's future for the public
0	he can take whichever one he choosesback home as his wife to peleus ' houseand pay no bridal gift
0	antilochus , you are driving like an idiot !
0	and not one of the achaean women
0	uncontrollably , just like a cauldron
0	he throws me into pointless bitter fights
0	and our ships set off , the achaean fleet
0	when we achaeans loot some well-built trojan town , my prizes never match the ones you get
0	i would have my fill of troubles
0	the old man finished speaking
0	which have come over him—so fate ordains
0	lord odysseus spoke , then moved across the threshold
0	he made a stand right there , in front of old nestor 's chariot , calling out to nestor , son of neleus—his words had wings
0	and a single servant woman , actoris ,
0	honoured wife of odysseus , laertes ' son ,
0	their dear wives and children stood up on the walls as a defence , along with those too old to fight
0	not by himself , for helen and megapenthes
0	up to now , the two lapiths had been urging well-armed achaeans from inside the rampart to defend their ships
0	then athena spoke to him :
0	it would be shameful if we both went backto olympus , to zeus ' bronze-floored home , without a fight
0	while they went on talking to each other in this way , eurynome and the nurse prepared the bed
0	and how we did not get him
0	agamemnon 's prudent speech changed his brother 's mind
0	but you must listen now to what i say—
0	the lovely goddess left , and white-armed servants came , chattering as they moved there from their chambers
0	the dancing rhythms made a powerful sound
0	after a while , they realized they could not get out
0	and beg him for his life ?
0	no matter who it is comes to this house
0	idomeneus slaughtered phaestus , son of borus , a meonian , who would come from fertile tarne
0	but as those two men came out into the plain , they did not go unobserved by wide-seeing zeus
0	there 's no pain in a man 's heart , no grieving ,
0	not if he would died among his comrades
0	son of atreus , how can you say such things ?
0	began to cry aloud , but i was glad
0	tells stories which are lies
0	belonging to godlike odysseus
0	he especially roused the spirit in fierce ajax , son of telamon
0	he jumped out of his chariot down to the ground holding his weapons
0	with disgusting clothing on my body
0	in fact , many women kept watching him
0	that fears the gods
0	each onehas sunk itself deep inside a soldier 's flesh , some strong , swift warrior
0	but diomedes with his ruthless bronze had gone to run down aphrodite—knowing she was not a godwho could do much in battle , not one of those who control men 's wars
0	our lookouts sat each day on windy heights ,
0	it would violate all sense of what is right if i assisted or escorted on his way
0	strong diomedes , son of tydeus , is hurt , as is odysseus , famous for his spear , agamemnon and eurypylus as well , with an arrow in his thigh
0	up allthose of youwho want to make the effort for this prize
0	and make things hard for you in days to come
0	so now , my friend , you too must die
0	pour libations to the dead around it ,
0	for from that time on there was nothing mysterious about how ordinary life could appear on stage and what language it would use
0	who summons and disperses men 's assemblies ,
0	but you go on ahead
0	when dawn came up
0	still , it 's shameful to go home with nothing
0	tyndareus ' daughter acted differently ,
0	euanthes ' son , one of apollo 's priests ,
0	the spear point pushed on through , below the bone , piercing his bladder
0	although we needed food , we never thought
0	so hear me out
0	whatever name i say
0	but augeias , king of men , kept the horses there in elis
0	he quickly spoke to ajax , who stood close by
0	then their father gave me this reply :
0	goddess with the gleaming eyes , answered telemachus :
0	vastly inferior to me , someone
0	when you sail from there , do not leave me behind , unburied , unlamented
0	i see suitors here
0	those who have never had the experience of having to see at the same time that they also longed to transcend all seeing will scarcely be able to imagine how definitely and clearly these two processes coexist and are felt at the same time , as one contemplates the tragic myth
0	i do not think the family of arcesius
0	the strap across his chest was frightening ,
0	we gods are always suffering dreadfullyat each other 's hands , when we bring men help
0	his wife presented helen with some lovely gifts—
0	as he spoke , black clouds of grief enveloped hector
0	the cliff 's too smooth , like polished stone
0	the other is aeneas , proud anchises ' son , that 's his claim
0	athena sent this shape to lord odysseus ' home ,
0	but antinous threw a footstool at him
0	do you wish to see how overbearing agamemnon is ?
0	worrying if her fine son could avoid being killed , or if those arrogant suitors would slaughter him
0	more than the others were
0	once they leaned back and stirred the water with their oars , a calming sleep fell on his eyelids , undisturbed and very sweet , something very similar to death
0	the night will come when some hateful marriage
0	the palace of heroic alcinous
0	and to hear you talk about my mother
0	my friends , danaan heroes , comrades of ares , let no one lag behind to pick up loot , seeking to reach our ships with all you can
0	i will go ahead and smooth the horses ' path
0	with human flesh and washed it down with milk ,
0	what do you need ?
0	now you lie disfigured , my heart refuses meat and drink , though both are in this hut , because i miss you so
0	they washed their hands and feet and went inside the house , back to odysseus
0	and make a raft , a large one
0	who followed him , not one was left alive
0	you yourself must beg him to report the truth
0	i know himby his shield , the visor on his helmet , and by looking at his horses
0	will not go unfulfilled—for all of them—
0	so i will declarewhat , in my view , it 's best for me to say—i do not believe that agamemnon , atreus ' son , or any other argivewill persuade me , for no thanks are givento the man who always fights without restagainst the enemy
0	wife to polybus , who lived in thebes in egypt ,
0	he 's just fled from a ship of thesprotians
0	it 's not so high
0	until i am finished with this robe , so i
0	as for the trench they dug , my horses will jump over that with ease
0	he brought on stormy blasts from every kind of wind , concealing land and sea
0	any longer from your home , abandoning
0	to refuse to take your word
0	you have encountered dying men before ,
0	through these gates the goddesses lashed on their horses
0	i will lie down there
0	a race like me ,
0	in the district will get angry with me
0	who took so much upon himself
0	she was not alone—two attendants went with her
0	first he armed himself with bronze around his body , and the two servants did the same , putting on
0	who had no peer
0	besides , my spiritdid not mean to stay enraged for ever , although i thought i would not end my anger
0	wise penelope then spoke out in reply :
0	ereuthalion then stepped forward as their champion , a godlike soldier ,
0	antinous ' words made them all jump up laughing
0	jumped up , ran off , and came back to the ships
0	silver axle boxes revolve on either side
0	in the hall , and put them in a secret place ,
0	with many thoughts of death
0	i will have some horses harnessed for you ,
0	antilochus was very pleased to get it
0	i understand things well
0	she stuffed three goblets in her bosom
0	my friends , there would be no glory for us if we went back to the hollow ships
0	nine acres and more
0	neleus in earlier times used to sit on them ,
0	my hand let go my spear
0	beside him lay a woman he would seized from lesbos , fair diomede , one of phorbas ' daughters
0	it hit the son of priam 's shield , a perfect circle
0	we should put together very quickly ,
0	generations of men are like the leaves
0	archer god apollo 's priest sought out his daughter
0	for all his clear-voiced talk
0	her king 's possessions—bronze and gold and iron , all finely crafted work
0	enough to set an ambush , in the straits
0	ox-eyed queen hera smiled , and , as she did so , put the garment round her breasts
0	once he would said this , alcinous led them out , and they followed him
0	or are you feeling sad for argives as they are being obliteratedamong the hollow ships for all their pride ?
0	in response to calchas , swift-footed achilles said :
0	there , waiting for bright dawn , we fell asleep
0	the dear nurse eurycleia
0	he said to priam :
0	all together in the hall
0	when they would sworn and finished promising ,
0	just as a bitch stands snarling above her tender pups when she sees anyone
0	looking in every detail just like mentor
0	the gods aren ’ t treating you with disrespect
0	the introduction of the chorus , according to schiller , was the decisive step with which war was declared openly and nobly against naturalism in art
0	the story of or name those in the common mass , not even with ten tongues , ten mouths , an untiring voice , a heart of bronze , unless the olympian muses , daughters of aegis-bearing zeus , could sing of the men , all those who came to troy
0	she came to hector in the form of deïphobus , with his tireless voice and shape
0	you have not hit me
0	you are a difficult man to deal with , hector , for you do not take advice
0	some god poured over me
0	old priam had agreed , promising he would give her to him
0	just as a great wave crashes from the wide sea onto the planking of a ship , driven by forceful winds whipping up the waves— that 's how trojans , with tremendous shouts , came down ,
0	whenever i return to ithaca
0	in that chesthis mind can not be changed
0	then alcinous again spoke up and said to him :
0	or from blustering west wind , the ones
0	the painful agonies of all the argives
0	whether to stay with me and tend the house , out of respect for what the people say
0	if he were brave
0	here the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man
0	he was the best of all , because he had most men
0	world , do you have a sense of your creator ?
0	here was a spirit with alien , even nameless , needs , a memory crammed with questions , experiences , secret places , beside which the name dionysus was written like a question mark
0	you will fulfill your mission
0	but come , let 's sort out the best course of action , so we both can drag the corpse and then get backin person to bring joy to our companions
0	to cherish you the way she cared back then
0	they drag me by my feet throughout the house
0	so now i will goto meet hector , killer of the man i loved
0	and gave me sandals to tie on my feet ,
0	i chased you away from your own cattle
0	i thought i was paying alexanderfor his wickedness , but now my swordhas shattered in my fist , while from my handmy spear has flown in vain
0	sliced right through—with a groan the stag collapsed down in the dust , and its spirit left the beast
0	and numerous rich flocks belonging to
0	i would not spare you or your comrades
0	in the ground there , make rich sacrifice
0	as pallas athena did supporting him
0	dionysus , as before , when he fled from lycurgus , king of the edoni , saved himself in the depths of the sea , that is , in the mysterious floods of a secret cult which would gradually overrun the entire world
0	war does not offer much relief
0	and did not reach old age in his own home
0	like some lion , he thinks savage thoughts , a beast which followsonly its own power , its own proud heart , as it goes out against men 's flocks , seekinga feast of cattle—that 's how achillesdestroys compassion
0	at once , he slung across his shoulder his curved bow , then threw a gray wolf skin on it
0	keeps making all this trouble for you ?
0	your famewill reach as far as the shining light of dawn
0	he knew who i was
0	so if you win her favour , there 's a hope
0	both now and in the future , to kill you ,
0	the entire truth , just as you requested
0	i will lie down in bed , which has become for me
0	immortal divine fluid then flowed out , ichor , which circulates only in the blessed gods
0	after they would done that ,
0	discussing all the troubles he would endured
0	let storm winds snatch it , carry it away
0	just as phaeacian men have more skill than anyone at sailing a fast ship across the sea , so their women have great skill
0	many men were killed
0	even those who lived so long ago—
0	have no use for bow or quiver , but for masts ,
0	now look at what you have done
0	the best and loftiest thing which mankind can share is achieved through a crime , and people must now accept the further consequences , namely , the entire flood of suffering and troubles with which the offended divine presences afflict the nobly ambitious human race
0	even in hector 's chest the heart beat rapidly
0	he smashed both hinges
0	so now i will give you answers to those questions
0	do not hold back your handsin murderous warfare till you have corneredinside the famous walls of troy those mennow in retreat before you
0	and only with this hope was there a a ray of joy on the face of the fragmented world , torn apart into individuals , just as myth reveals in the picture of the eternal sorrow of sunken demeter , who rejoices again for the first time when someone says to her that she might be able once again to give birth to dionysus
0	up to her rooms and there wept for odysseus ,
0	may he carry backbloody spoils from his slaughtered enemy , making his mother 's heart rejoice
0	i were either as young as you , the son
0	in our fear , we moved back to the far end of the cave ,
0	i will take back from here more gold , red bronze , fair women , and gray iron—all i captured
0	with a good heart , he gives you food and drink ,
0	my life 's so miserable and empty
0	the judgment of the two old men , cadmus and tiresias , seems also to be the judgment of the aged poet : the mind of the cleverest individual does not throw away that old folk tradition , that eternally propagating reverence for dionysus ; indeed , where such amazing powers are concerned , it is appropriate at least to demonstrate a diplomatically prudent show of joining in
0	are willing in your heart to help me
0	he 's full of anger , more so now than ever
0	even the god-like plato speaks of the creative capability of poets and how this is not a conscious understanding , but for the most part only ironically , and he draws a comparison with the talent of prophets and dream interpreters , for the poet is not able to write until he has lost his conscious mind and reason no longer resides in him
0	openly or in secret ?
0	long before that we should be considering
0	daughter of icarius , and quickly , too
0	as long as you had in your hearts some hope
0	but his ruthless heart
0	they make sure odysseus stays where nobody can see him—
0	old phoenix stayed there , to go to sleep , as achilles told him , so that he may go away with himin his ships back to their dear native land , if he wants , for he wo not take him by force
0	we both seem born
0	holding a golden staff
0	penelope found him especially pleasant because of how he talked ,
0	old man , you should go home and prophesy
0	but while the artist , in his revelation of the truth , always keeps his enchanted gaze hanging on what still remains hidden after his revelation , theoretical man enjoys and remains satisfied with the covers which have been thrown off and takes his greatest delight in the process of continually successful unveiling , a success which his own power has brought about
0	no matter how young and strong , no living manwould dare to make the trip to our encampment
0	i wish to get back home without delay—
0	you dog—once more you are evading death for now
0	later , when we would had our fill of food and drink , i began to speak , asking you to come with us
0	odysseus would hide his head once more and groan
0	why wo not you yield to the immortal gods ?
0	then achilles spoke— his words had wings :
0	i know you care for me , but let me leave the city by myself , go to the achaean ships , then beg him , that ruthless man , that violent monster
0	they thought peleus ' swift-footed son by his shipshad set aside his anger and made friends again
0	stand there with hands and feet lashed to the mast
0	he would left—in case you harmed your lovely skin
0	standing near them , etoneus carved the meat
0	glorious hector struck him as he grabbed the corpse—with a rock he hit his head and split the skull completely open inside his heavy helmet
0	as soon as you see him stretched out to sleep , then you must use all your strength and courage to hold him there for all his desperate moves , as he struggles to escape
0	from across the hall the suitors yelled :
0	overcome with weariness and sleep , athena
0	in a mad fit he committed evil acts
0	the fattest one which seems to him the best
0	but in his heart ,
0	they called out to one another continually , especially geranian nestor , achaea 's guardian
0	reaching priam 's house , she found him weeping there and mourning
0	but his eyes stayed firm between his eyelids ,
0	and sat around the king , seeking justice , throughout the spacious gates of hades ' home
0	about a prophecy which you , old man ,
0	but all this lies in the lap of the gods
0	by contrast , image and idea , under the influence of a truly appropriate music , reach an elevated significance
0	as thestor fell , his spirit abandoned him
0	the mortal hercules , zeus ' great-hearted son ,
0	whether he was overwhelmed by enemies
0	my heart and mind know well the day is comingwhen sacred ilion will be destroyed , along with priam of the fine ash spear and priam 's people
0	odysseus , too , looked round the house to check if anyone
0	you have been ravaging my house , raping women ,
0	cebriones went with them as third commander
0	so you two can be happy in your hearts
0	with his spear right in the groin and drove the bronze
0	everything you say , old man , is true enough
0	when i was being beaten down at sea
0	i have not yet come near
0	father zeus , have you ever so deludeda high-minded king and stolen his glory ?
0	so you should go up to your upper room
0	and did not bring destruction on them all ,
0	and get back to his native land—he lacks
0	chios on our left , or take the southern route ,
0	odysseus , why are you sitting here like this , like someone who ca not speak , eating out your heart , never touching food or drink ?
0	where are they sleeping ?
0	as nestor finished , the sun was going down ,
0	and come up with devious schemes , people say
0	go to agamemnon 's hut , atreus ' son
0	some at the millstone ground up yellow grain ,
0	and you , our guest , should no longer hide
0	so i will speak plainly
0	to steal away the spoils i would won at troy ,
0	even now , in the assembly of immortal gods , she 's always insulting me , accusing me of favouring the trojans in the war
0	but the response he got was brutal :
0	as he thought about his options , he thought his best plan was to find aeneas
0	on sheep fleeces and an untanned ox-hide ,
0	he begged for mercy , addressing achilles with these winged words :
0	if i had known
0	have shown they are the best
0	you should not exist or ever have been born
0	he 's turning it around in all directions
0	just as children rejoice to see life in a father who lies sick ,
0	now , just in front of egypt there 's an island ,
0	nevertheless , he describes the essential being of song as follows :
0	we dragged our boats into the sacred sea ,
0	there i will pray to you
0	listen to me , bold suitors , who have been ravaging this home
0	and gave her all the details her dear son
0	in everything , you ’ re the most useless argive of them all , because your mind is dull
0	swift-footed , godlike achilles charged that cloud three times , striking hard each time with his bronze spear
0	whom he left at home a new-born child ,
0	it would be hard for me to compensate
0	then the lovely goddess went back to olympus
0	but then you , surrendering to your arrogant spirit , shamed our strongest man , honoured by the gods
0	pull your horses back !
0	but even so , he did not neglect what menelaus told him
0	she felt pity for odysseus as he suffered
0	every one of you , get your spears and shields prepared for action
0	go home , and there make sacred offerings
0	the sort of offshore breeze which makes men 's ships race out across the broad back of the sea
0	in all other matters
0	he turned the horses to the swift ship by the shore , took out the lovely gifts , the clothing and the gold , which menelaus had given telemachus ,
0	my father 's house , great-hearted alcinous
0	these took him away , back to the city , tired out , moaning heavily , blood dripping from his wounded arm
0	when i am bowed down with a ripe old age ,
0	now we are offeringseven of the best we have and much more
0	when he noticed him ,
0	when the two armies came to one common ground , they smashed into each other—shields , spears , fierce angry men encased in bronze
0	but he made poseidon want to help danaans , even more so than before
0	and let no female god , no male one either , seek to thwart my plan
0	he killed othryoneus , a man from cabesus , who now lived in troy
0	we two stood in the doorway
0	perched up in thick foliage of the forest ,
0	who ruled the people here and who they were
0	for the feast which you have chanced upon is in his honour
0	but archer artemis was no help to him then , no more than was his expertise in archery , at which he would been pre-eminent in former times
0	when he saw danaans coming up with horses , he would approach them , shouting words of encouragement :
0	the will , the memory of our personal goals , constantly interrupts this calm contemplation of ours , over and over again , but the next beautiful setting , in which pure will-less knowledge presents itself to us , always , once again , releases us from willing
0	not even in summer or at harvest time
0	the bright-eyed goddess went there , once she would finished speaking to nausicaa
0	they had a blue enamel cornice
0	still in a rage , achilles chased them with his spear , his heart filled with strong and unremitting fury , still eager to win glory
0	agamemnon , king of men , then answered nestor :
0	achilles gave a huge cry of grief
0	and prepared a feast for me , like an ox
0	no wild animal he chased escaped him
0	seeing that zeus had sent the bird , men resumed the fight , attacking trojans eagerly , their battle spirits roused
0	gripping the arrow notch , the ox-gut bowstring , he pulled back , drawing the string right to his nipple , iron arrow head against the bow
0	how unequal the division of luck and disaster !
0	dared stand and face up to the enemy
0	let 's picture for ourselves a generation growing up with this fearlessness in its gaze , with this heroic push into what is monstrous ; let 's picture for ourselves the bold stride of these dragon slayers , the proud audacity with which they turn their backs on all the doctrines of weakness associated with optimism , so that they live with resolution , fully and completely
0	but in his heart telemachus had recognized
0	let fire consumeour strategies , men 's plans , our treaties , ratified with wine and handshakes , those things we used to trust
0	but after the twelfth dawn had come since hector 's death , phoebus apollo spoke out to the immortals :
0	seized two of my companions in his fist ,
0	then at close quarters , hectorattacked leitus , son of great-hearted alectryon
0	he came out only to the scaean gates and to the oak tree
0	lord agamemnon , son of atreus , king of men , let 's end our discussions nowand not postpone work given by the gods
0	and the shield slung round my shoulders
0	as a more welcome guest
0	until your cunning led you from that cave ,
0	here we must at once call attention to the common characteristic of these two conceptions in the genesis of opera , namely , that in them the ideal is not felt as unattained or nature as lost
0	so you just accept whatever trouble he sends each of you
0	if he did not , this bullying of yours , son of atreus , would be your last
0	by the time achaeans had rushed through the stakes , as they crossed the ditch , many had died at trojan hands
0	kissed the fertile ground
0	a rugged place , not fit for herding horses ,
0	painting with music is thus in every respect the opposite to the myth creating power of true music
0	above the mound , his finely fashioned oar
0	would that i were young , my strength as firm , as it was that dayepeians buried lord amarynceusat bouprasium
0	once the men had prayed , scattering barley grain , they pulled back the beast 's head , slit its throat , flayed it , sliced thigh bones out and hid them in twin layers of fat , with raw meat on top
0	once they would put gleaming bronze around their bodies ,
0	those horses of warrior achilles , descendant of aeacus , are hard to manage or control for any mortal person , except achilles , son of an immortal mother
0	why start weeping now ?
0	as they talked like this ,
0	with a hearty laugh , he then addressed his comrades :
0	i , too , know well enoughhow to shout out taunting words and insults
0	who would been compelled to sing before the suitors , kept trying to get away from his own murky fate
0	you are great atinsults , ajax , but really stupid
0	we follow along , but only moment by moment
0	bright helios never gazes down on them ,
0	then said something like :
0	in your own house , in case they take over
0	more than odysseus ever would have got
0	from her husband , who , in the twentieth year ,
0	in our own land
0	it 's true some young men out in a black ship
0	that 's how fate decrees he will see his friends
0	sounding a dreadful thunder clap , he loosed his lightning , a dazzling fiery bolt which hit the ground immediately in front of diomedes ' horses
0	you are a cunning man , with no lack of wit—to consider
0	the suitors were outside odysseus ' palace ,
0	beside the breaking surf
0	so what if the gods , who live forever , made him a spearman ?
0	and speak the truth—whether you chanced to hear where my son 's living now
0	succumb to fear too much
0	and spirit moved back in his heart , he untied
0	those two allies you mention are excellent
0	but then from across the room telemachus shouted out a threat :
0	i lay in wait for him with my companions ,
0	but we wo not miss him muchif the rest of us get fighting strengthand help each other
0	if there was ever such a man , to welcome
0	earthshaker poseidon set in motion
0	come , let heralds of bronze-clad achaeanssummon all the soldiers to assembly
0	because she 's so desirable , we wait here ,
0	but still , though i have undergone so much ,
0	he had two sons—alcmaeon and amphilocus
0	we will lack the bravery to match our strength
0	achilles had brought fifty ships to troy—
0	where are you running ?
0	seeking a man-killing poison , something
0	without that , the delight in tragedy simply can not be explained
0	in phylacus ' palace , suffering harsh cruelty ,
0	telemachus , there 's no way we can ride
0	but come , let 's send out hand-picked mento go with all speed to achilles ' hut , peleus ' son
0	then lead her off , cheeks ravaged by her grief ,
0	in your father 's name , for i do not believe
0	the platonic dialogue was , so to speak , the boat on which the shipwreck of the old poetry , along with all its children , was saved
0	then the rest of achaea 's sons came running up
0	he sent me off , since , as it so happened ,
0	lays painful curses on his future life ,
0	our ships moved fast—
0	and then the noble youth rejoined the suitors
0	now , for instance , she 's just rescued him from certain death
0	a brother who was killed , not the worst man
0	the pigs gave out amazing squeals , as they were herded in
0	that traitor clytaemnestra slaughtered her right there beside me
0	for odysseus , her dear husband , until sweet sleep , cast by bright-eyed athena , spread across her eyelids
0	first he killed astynous , and then hypeiron , a shepherd of his people
0	by rousing violent winds and giant waves ?
0	using the analogy of a dream we can learn something about this naïve artist
0	to the leader of the people
0	then this stranger , once he gets back home ,
0	where did she find him ?
0	one scale sank down , the one which held the achaeans ' fate that day— it moved down to the all-sustaining earth , while the trojans ' fate rose up toward wide heaven
0	the lycians , led by powerful commanders , their kings , were climbing up the parapets like some black whirlwind
0	does your heart prompt you to fight against mein the hope you will win priam 's royal honoursamong horse-taming trojans ?
0	everywhere along the wall , along the parapet , men 's blood was spatteredfrom trojans and achaeans
0	mixed wine in a bowl for them and served it round , coming to each man in his turn
0	it was easy for me , as he went away , to see that from the back by the markings on his feet and legs
0	our task here is to battle with our hands
0	i sailed across the sea
0	where the dionysian powers rise up as impetuously as we experience them now , apollo , too , must already have descended among us , wrapped in a cloud ; and the next generation will probably behold his most ample beautiful effects
0	but i would not allow them to lament—
0	there is no better way
0	i do not have any choice
0	as my men came out , i spoke to them and said :
0	all the achaeans roared out their support :
0	made by his shipmates as they moved around ,
0	old man , she already knows
0	odysseus then spoke to his servants and his son :
0	he had a herald , older than himself ,
0	i have come to you and to your husband here ,
0	troops streamed out , infantry and horses
0	i was the first to shoot an arrow off
0	who did they say they were ?
0	telemachus ' mother sat across from him ,
0	the weapon did not leave his hand and miss the target
0	friend , surely it 's all right for me to answer , and my heart is torn
0	daughter of the old man of the sea ,
0	then old man nestor , the chariot fighter , began the ritual washing
0	it really would have been a welcome thing to me and to my son
0	and came to see the two
0	pale fear took hold of me
0	the battle raged , this way and that , across the entire plain , as warriors hurled bronze-tipped spears at one another , between the simoeis and xanthus rivers
0	then a huge wild boar
0	along with father zeus , will be enough
0	from the large amount remaining , took pieces
0	and dressed me differently , a ragged cloak
0	already held her brothers in lacedaemon , in their own dear native land
0	in a foreign land is a worthless fool ,
0	it was a glancing blow , but the point of the spear sliced quite near the bone
0	i saw him on an island
0	indeed , i could recount a longer story—
0	as if he were a god
0	i would like to be therefor that sacred feast
0	gifts of aeolus , brave son of hippotas
0	treating her as her own daughter , providing toys , whatever she desired
0	once sacred persephone dispersed those female shadows here and there ,
0	to protect his house from ruin
0	or has some other man now married her ?
0	now the black earth held him
0	in the middle he placed his poorer troops , to force them to keep fighting on against their will
0	to my native land , for my heart is keen
0	for him that will be a worse disaster
0	anchor the swift ship that brought you here ?
0	get other soldiers to remain in place
0	child of zeus , and leader of your people ,
0	as he said this , achilles took the old man 's wrist on his right hand , in case his heart was fearful
0	what antinous had thrown did not make him stagger
0	many of his comrades , the ceteians , were also slaughtered there around him
0	how could he be contemptuous of his public out of a high respect for his public ?
0	i know in my mind and heart that day will comewhen holy troy , priam , and his people , fine spearmen , will be annihilated , when high-ruling zeus , son of cronos , who dwells in the sky , angry at their lies , will shake his dark aegis against them all
0	a savage with no sense of law and justice
0	son of atreus , and died in my own home
0	so why should i not bring an evil fortuneon these trojans when they have made me angry ?
0	i could just sling a beast as large as that
0	then she starts to grieve ,
0	so he could wash his hands
0	phaeacians have no pilots , no steering oar ,
0	in there , too , are springs which always flow
0	their lives and spirits , since it 's far better
0	some of them , like gervinus [ g g gervinus , author of shakespeare , and shakespeare commentaries ] , do not even reach the entrance halls
0	or go outside and weep
0	that 's how you , patroclus , rushed at cebriones , in your killing frenzy
0	to help him with the power i once had
0	i might lose my temper , abandon you , and hate you just as much as i have loved you
0	in fact , it 's wine that 's seized your wits , or else your mind
0	enormous agonies for oedipus ,
0	and handed out the portions , while megapenthes ,
0	fresh-washed clothing when they go out dancing
0	i do not think he will long survive my arrow 's force , if apollo , son of zeus , really was the onewho put it in my heart to leave lycia
0	and if you claim to be my father ,
0	around priam 's great city , many men , sons of the immortals , are now fighting
0	in spite of all modern ideas and the judgments of democratic taste , could the victory of optimism , the developing hegemony of reasonableness , practical and theoretical utilitarianism , as well as democracy itself ( which occurs in the same period ) perhaps be a symptom of failing power , approaching old age , physiological exhaustion , all these factors rather than pessimism ?
0	all around that misty rock
0	once they heard his call ,
0	but there was nowhere i could plant my feet ,
0	when earthshaker poseidon heard these words , he left and went to scheria , home of the phaeacians
0	this husband of mine has no sense nowand wo not acquire any in the future
0	then stick him there
0	as for us , we are visitors here and come
0	just as a man sitting on a rocky point hauls up a monstrous fish out of the sea , using a line and bright bronze hook— that 's how patroclus dragged thestor from his chariot , mouth skewered on the shining spear
0	as offerings to the gods and to prepare
0	next , in the leaping contest amphialus came out victorious , and then ,
0	the swineherd went away
0	menelaus spoke , rousing the heart in warlike ajax , who moved up among those fighting in the front
0	moving close to him in the form of a young man ,
0	some spirit deluded me , made me come
0	so he got home
0	and sleep is sweet
0	could never fool me
0	but do not provoke me too much with your fists ,
0	if they miss your voice , they may shy or panic , or refuse to charge straight into battle
0	the whole great house resounded to the steps of men celebrating a good time
0	he was angry with his father and moved away
0	which i saw with my own eyes
0	noble wife of laertes ' son , odysseus ,
0	to make his voyage dreadful
0	outside the harbour , there 's a fertile island ,
0	the attempt , for example , to use the theater as an institution for the moral education of the people , still taken seriously in schiller 's time , is already reckoned among the incredible antiques of a dated type of education
0	one who adjudicates the many quarrels
0	once we would ravaged priam 's lofty city ,
0	between the epic prologue and epilogue lay the lyrical , dramatic present , the essential drama
0	dear nurse eurycleia then answered her :
0	my child , what you say is all well and good , but come ,
0	but if you would seen that , your heart would have felt great pity
0	in her heart she thought up another trick
0	meanwhile , these men are feasting on my home
0	the glorious son of pelegon then said in reply :
0	they came where wounded fair-haired menelaus lay
0	in my hut , too , and in my black ship , there 's lots of trojan loot
0	where the political drives are taken to be absolutely valid , it is just as necessary that a people should go to the path toward the most extreme secularization whose most magnificent but also most terrifying expression may be found in the roman imperium
0	aeneas slaughtered medon and iasus
0	the way he used to and avert disaster
0	no other woman 's heart would be so hard
0	even if you yourself escape ,
0	tall and very skilled in making splendid things
0	nausicaa , how did your mother bear a girl so careless ?
0	it 's zeus ' fault and fate—those furies , too , who walk in darkness
0	and then parcel out among themselves
0	thick fires burned the corpses ceaselessly
0	but telemachus , who could not yet believe
0	in these established concepts we already have assembled all the components of a profound and pessimistic world view , together with the mysterious teachings of tragedy : the basic acknowledgement of the unity of all existing things , the idea of individuation as the ultimate foundation of all evil , art as the joyful hope that the spell of individuation is there for us to break , as a premonition of a re-established unity
0	that brave odysseus has died somewhere
0	i moored my curving ships in egypt 's river ,
0	but wandering around some foreign land ?
0	achilles , interrupting agamemnon , shouted :
0	as he thought , he did what seemed to him the better option—
0	his words had wings :
0	for here there is no reminder of asceticism , spirituality , and duty
0	for all his devious skills , got tired out ,
0	his skill in prophecy , apollo 's gift , had led achaean ships to troy
0	so there was no light coming from the sky
0	firmly over anticlus ' mouth and held him ,
0	whose eyes stopped weeping
0	eat up , god-guided stranger , and enjoy the kind of food we offer
0	and quickly skim across wide tracts of sea ,
0	your dear son telemachus
0	long-haired achaeans gulped a quick meal by their huts
0	his achaean army he brought here in vain
0	telemachus did not turn his back for very long
0	and where , breathless , we once thought we were being extinguished in a convulsive distention of all feelings , and little remained to tie us to our present existence , we now hear and see only the hero wounded to death , yet not dying , with his despairing cry : longing !
0	whenever they spin their threads of trouble ,
0	not to arm myself
0	he set up his massive anvil on its block ,
0	they went inside the hut and sat down on some chairs
0	a crude and lawless people
0	it was huge—twenty-two four-wheeled wagons ,
0	who first established seven-gated thebes ,
0	but sthenelus , son of famous capaneus , answered :
0	a man with every form of excellence ,
0	they reached the splendid house and found his wife , a gigantic woman , like a mountain peak
0	once rose-fingered dawn arrived , we dragged up our ship and made it secure
0	as he continued on his way , he met both men called ajax , arming themselvesamong the hordes of troops , with crowds of men on foot
0	when alcinous 's fine son heard these words , he moved so he was standing in the middle of the crowd ,
0	we lowered the masts into the holds and then ,
0	collecting his reports in ithaca
0	mesaulius served the bread , a servant
0	there 's a steep cliff there , a rock facing the sea right in the misty surf , on gortyn 's borders ,
0	athena spoke , and resourceful lord odysseus
0	there 's nothing gives one more delight
0	my lady , have a precious trunk brought here ,
0	are already sitting beside their oars ,
0	whenever diomedes stood over some man he would just killed with his sword , crafty odysseus , from behind , would grab his feetand drag the body clear
0	who did they claim they were ?
0	beside the restless sea
0	and have you at the end—my gift to you ,
0	once etoneus heard , he did what he would been asked
0	is it a wedding ?
0	when the suitors notice they have gone missing
0	pour me out some barley grain
0	royal telemachus heard him and spoke up ,
0	for which we came here in our swift black ship
0	but even there , thanks to my excellence ,
0	there wind-swift iris stopped the horses , untied themfrom the chariot , and gave them heavenly fodder
0	but two warriors , thrasymedes and antilochus , well-known men , had not yet learned about the death of lord patroclus
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	his eye must be sun-like , in keeping with his origin
0	has asked me to do it , and i am willing
0	wise penelope then gave him her reply :
0	saying this , hector threw his bright spear at ajax , but missed
0	does not convince me
0	that this man came up and taunted you
0	when you are back in your own land ,
0	any plants by hand or plough the earth ,
0	melanthius said this and left them there , as they walked slowly onward
0	son of atreus , i fear we are being beaten back , forced home , if we are not all going to be destroyed right here , with war and plague killing off achaeans
0	he placed the lambs in his chariot
0	i may become some wild beast 's prey , its prize
0	and euryalus addressed the king and said :
0	the land grew there
0	the breastplate kept his body guarded from the spear
0	has forfeited his journey to achaea ,
0	to conceal his tears
0	well , i have got other troubles from the gods ,
0	that 's why of all the gods , he 's the onemen hate the most
0	he missed him , but not by much
0	on this point we base the fact that we can set a poem to music as a song or as a vivid presentation in pantomime or as both in an opera
0	cloud-gatherer zeus , quite irked , answered poseidon :
0	do we think we have got people to help outsomewhere behind us or some stronger wallwhich will hold off our men 's destruction ?
0	there was no man on this earth they honoured ,
0	and begged him—his words had wings :
0	and they put out to sea
0	they might drivetrojans worn out with fighting to the city , far from our ships and huts
0	he lit a fire and milked his flock , one by one ,
0	entreat her to inform him where the city was
0	he threw the rock and did not waste his throw—he hit cebriones , hector 's charioteer , a bastard sonof famous priam , as he held onto the reins
0	well-decked boats have stowed on board , then moved the ship to the harbour 's outer edge
0	given the incredibly clear and accurate plastic capability of their eyes , along with their intelligent and open love of colour , one can not go wrong in assuming that ( to the shame all those born later ) their dreams also had a logical causality of lines and circumferences , colours , and groupings , a sequence of scenes rather like their best bas reliefs , whose perfection would justify us , if such a comparison were possible , to describe the dreaming greek man as a homer and homer as a dreaming greek man , in a deeper sense than when modern man , with respect to his dreams , dares to compare himself with shakespeare
0	would now return and mingle with the suitors
0	let that dear heart in your chest endure it ,
0	talking is a man 's concern , every man 's ,
0	the sharp arrow went in there , kept going , and splattered blood down on the curving metal
0	mighty agamemnon then answered nestor :
0	odysseus meets the shades of the dead
0	they are easy to distinguish , for he lay in the centre of the pyre—the others burned some distance from him on the edges , the humans and the horses
0	snatches even these away
0	aeneas , why have you stepped forward , standing here so far in front of all your men ?
0	the wife of odysseus , who would been away so long
0	troy , argive ships , how achaeans made it home—
0	telemachus , together with the swineherd
0	talthybius , whose voice was like a god 's , was there ,
0	always roaming down into the city ,
0	so come—one of you must fetch a heifer
0	a sound beats in my ear , fast-moving horses ’ hooves
0	i have come to see if you could give me news
0	to maintain her wedded husband 's home
0	around it was a poplar grove , fed by its waters
0	they gathered in a group on the spacious grounds before the city
0	daughter of minos , whose mind loved slaughter
0	diomedes shouted this , then threw the spear , deliberately missing dolon
0	as he was returning to his native land
0	for he was keen to challenge our best men
0	you could see black earth appear
0	that swineherd eumaeus was going from the farm
0	there were many flocks , sheep as well as goats ,
0	from someone else 's goods , and each of them
0	just as the falcons with hooked talons and curved beaks
0	that 's what i said
0	that son , mighty megapenthes , born to a slave ,
0	and whom apollo and aegis-bearing zeus
0	then you would suffer death in misery
0	when , at a lavish feast in honour of the gods ,
0	once she would said this , she moved down from her shining upper chambers
0	they are being destroyed by one man 's charging frenzy
0	fair-haired menelaus then answered peisistratus , saying :
0	but the heart inside my chest is worried—
0	to that famous spearman menelaus ,
0	taller than before and sturdier to the eye
0	to join the suitors , while i stay outside , or , if you wish , stay here
0	of all things , you should now sit in the hall
0	at once he dispersed the mist , scattering the haze
0	we sailed in , hauled our ship up on the beach ,
0	once hera spoke , athena dashed off in pursuit , delighted in her heart
0	i am a daughter of arybas , whose wealth
0	who goes without a name once he 's been born
0	but he 's always got some god beside him , to ward off destruction
0	brought in the mixing bowl of shining silver
0	when a man like him , with a grief-stricken heart , makes a request ?
0	telamonian ajax then answered oïlean ajax :
0	he stored these carefully , and pallas athena ,
0	i find your actions here astounding
0	and i will tell you something else—make sure you remember it
0	here in our home , and also sacrifice
0	those who ransacked troy
0	would be here planning for your funeral
0	could not do a thing to stop him , nor could
0	the new comedy could now direct its attention to such a prepared and enlightened crowd , for whom euripides became , to some extent , the choir master
0	of all my shipmates there , eurylochus
0	all the hardships he went through
0	with your incessant need for food and drink ,
0	then he sat down , directly facing furious agamemnon
0	zeus and athena end the fighting
0	perimedes and eurylochus , bound me
0	that we may not despair utterly of the german spirit , must we not conclude that , in some essential manner , even these champions did not penetrate into the core of the hellenic nature , to establish a permanent alliance between german and greek culture ?
0	and am very much afraid to clasp your knee
0	my name 's well known—aethon—the younger son ,
0	ah stranger , i wish what you have just said
0	with this rock athena struck raging ares in the neck
0	athena had poured an amazing poise on him , across his shoulders and his head and made him look taller and more powerful , so the phaeacians
0	oucalegaon and antenor , both prudent men , elder statesmen , sat at the scaean gates , with priam and his entourage—panthous , thymoetes , lampus , clytius , and warlike hicataeon
0	with the torch of this idea , let 's look at socrates
0	with this in mind , it is permissible for us to assess euripides as the poet of socratic aesthetics
0	sitting down there , they talked to one another
0	he died in the river , at the hand of swift achilles , descended from aeacus
0	still , he would have been severely mauled
0	into the broad lap of ocean and go findthe old man of the sea in our father 's house
0	the strangers brought , and bring the men inside ,
0	he killed alcathous , dear warrior son of divinely bred aesyetes , anchises ' son-in-law
0	about those things that well may happen
0	of all bronze-clad achaeans to get home
0	the true song is the expression of this entire emotional condition , mixed and divided in this way
0	but what of achilles ?
0	we will think about how we can send him off ,
0	listen to me , you brave suitors
0	as are his hands , the glances from his eyes ,
0	when argives looked at him , they felt great joy , while the limbs of all the trojans shook with fear
0	it 's because of you the sounds of warfarecatch fire round our city
0	he would have tossed mefrom heaven into the sea , if night , who subdues gods and men , had not saved me
0	it is just like the relationship of the solemn rhapsodist of the olden times to the younger attitude , whose nature is described in plato 's ion : when i say something sad , my eyes fill with tears
0	if one were to choose the city 's finest men ,
0	a great deal of wealth from those egyptians ,
0	the immortal ones who hold wide heaven
0	hector seized hold of that ship and would not let go— gripping the ornamental marker on the stern , yelling to his trojans :
0	they all had a good laugh at him
0	and then to sparta , to see if i can find
0	once you know that ,
0	now i will tell you something—there 's a marker , so clear you can not miss it
0	have given , more so than to other women ,
0	and given me possessions of my own ,
0	shrewd odysseus then answered him and said :
0	i will start by giving you this golden cup
0	to cut that primordial and all-powerful dionysian element out of tragedy and to rebuild tragedy as a pure , new , and un-dionysian art , morality , and world view—that has now revealed itself to us very clearly as the tendency of euripides
0	if so , all his flesh will fester
0	on the bed he threw some skins from sheep and goats
0	o father zeus , athena , and apollo ,
0	this breed of broad-faced cattle has increased
0	after this , i can endureeverything
0	so now he would have given eumelus the mare , as achaeans had agreed , but antilochus , great-hearted nestor 's son , stood up to claim his right
0	a fair and spacious circle
0	praying to athena and offering sacrifice
0	poseidon also answered themis ' summons , coming from the sea to join them
0	and tell all other men to do so , too
0	with more rope and lashed me even tighter
0	his words had wings :
0	there 's nothing i will accept , despite my need
0	by father zeus , athena , and apollo , i wish such spirit would fill each man 's chest
0	you must fix the rope at both its ends onto the mast
0	resourceful odysseus then answered him and said :
0	they tightened forestays , and then hoisted a white sail on twisted ox-hide ropes
0	to go through hellas and middle argos ,
0	and he 's made this threat—which he intends to carry out—he will maimyour swift horses in their traces , throw you bothout of the chariot , smash it in pieces
0	and then to pay no attention ,
0	the lovely goddess answered me at once
0	but hurry to the light as quickly as you can
0	made them a curse against the argives ,
0	to a roof-beam high above her head and died ,
0	but a prudent man , one to whom people have given their trust , who has so many things to think about , should not sleep all night
0	then shrewd odysseus stripped off his rags , grabbed up the bow and quiver full of arrows , and sprang
0	for all their arrogance
0	then came the men on foot in their thousands
0	these poor people naturally do not have any sense of how deathly and ghost-like this very health of theirs sounds , when the glowing life of the dionysian throng roars past them under the magic of the dionysian , not only does the bond between man and man lock itself in place once more , but also nature itself , most alienated , most hostile or subjugated , rejoices again in her festival of reconciliation with her prodigal son , man
0	wise penelope had thought of something else—
0	are all so sensible and thoughtful
0	he spoke up , asking me some questions :
0	flames will burntwelve noble sons of great-hearted trojans , all cremated with you
0	first , eumaeus slung his sharp sword from his shoulder and wrapped a really thick cloak all around him , to keep out the wind
0	i would never noticed such a lovely tree
0	where do i stop ?
0	of all the kings zeus cherishes , it ’ s youi hate the most
0	a herald gave a splendid lyre to phemius ,
0	among men who are you ?
0	o nestor , son of neleus , great glory of achaeans
0	in appearance you do not seem to be a slave ,
0	strange lady , why urge me so eagerly to tell you ?
0	so much so that all the neighbouring men
0	did not turn out the way the suitors wished
0	to see the swineherd , the man who tends your pigs
0	the insolence of those presumptuous men
0	i do not think that spear flew in vain from the strong hand of panthous ' valiant son
0	bright-eyed goddess athena answered him :
0	cloud-gatherer zeus then answered her :
0	then lost his hollow ships , with all men dead
0	has come about—an escort and these gifts ,
0	as they lamented , the son of cronos saw them
0	they were keen to slaughter me
0	send us on againto where thracians sleep and to those horses
0	she would climbed up pergamus
0	there are two cities there , with all the land
0	then chryses arrivedat the swift ships of bronze-armed achaeans
0	thought of something else
0	the daughter of icarius woke from her sleep ,
0	i will swim for it
0	but thoas , in times past , you were a man who always stood his groundand encouraged other men to do the same , if you saw someone shirking
0	he now lies by his curved sea-worthy ships , angry at agamemnon , his people 's shepherd
0	inside the palace , you will first greet the queen
0	to use some of the abundant food they stored
0	father zeus , are not you incensed at this barbarity ?
0	his spirit left his body with each gasp he took
0	in the morning , some of us dragged our ships
0	telemachus moved off , going through the hall ,
0	oh , son of laertes , happy odysseus ,
0	but i tell you this—and it will happen
0	the men bathed in the sea , washed off impurities
0	the best thing i could do would be to find
0	that 's why my heartcannot concern itself with what you have said , only with killing , blood , men 's dying groans
0	ajax , son of telamon , achaea 's tower of strength , was the first to break through ranks of trojans , punching out some breathing room for his companions
0	thus these soldiers went at the fight like a raging fire , as neleus ' horses carried nestor from the fight
0	achaeans ca not all rule here as kings
0	he was also sowing troubles for the suitors
0	when they had cooked the upper cuts of meat
0	next , achilles moved up to mulius and with his spear struck him on the ear
0	had given him that name when he was born , but now all young men called him irus , because he ran around carrying messages for anyone who asked him
0	so odysseus went to sleep there , and the young men slept around him
0	then he set the head rolling through the crowd , like some round stone
0	you have come , telemachus , you sweet light
0	around them , people were overwhelmed with wailing and laments throughout the city
0	everything going on here is my concern ,
0	he told how he next came to telepylos where the laestrygonians live ,
0	to whoever he desires
0	outside the harbour , right against the land ,
0	he went inside the spacious cave
0	when encircled by a crowd of crafty hunters ,
0	they cut these skillfully , pierced the meat with spits , roasted them with care , and passed around the portions
0	at that moment , as he watched , hector began to shake in fear
0	as the two groups moved out to the same spot , they crashed together , smashing shields and spears , the battle frenzy of bronze-armed warriors
0	attached to it with a slender cord , he placed a quivering dove with the cord tied to its foot
0	oh stranger , i wish what you have said might come about
0	on a bright shining chair
0	to protect her great house for her ?
0	but if sarpedon 's dear to you , if your heart feels pity for him , then let him be killed in a fierce combat at patroclus ' hands , son of menoetius
0	but then , leiodes ran out , grabbed odysseus ' knees ,
0	meanwhile the suitors were being driven into action by agelaus ,
0	are not like you
0	to find some places we could use as lookouts
0	while he was having a good time , tucked away
0	but i will be your guide—even all the way to famous argos—attending to your every need on a swift shipor else on foot
0	friends , there 's no way an older man weighed down with grief can fight a younger man
0	the god soon gave us our heart 's fill of game—
0	the winnowing shovel is a device for separating grain from chaff
0	it may take them far past euboea
0	listen to yourself , my pessimistic gentleman and worshipper of art , listen with open ears to a single selected passage from your book , to that not ineloquent passage about the dragon killer , who may sound like an awkward pied piper to those with young ears and hearts
0	he would left these well-balanced ships at percote , then come on foot to ilion
0	that 's how strong diomedes went to fight the trojans in his angry fury
0	father of us all and son of cronos ,
0	and we endured countless other hardships
0	we should not make this mattersomething you and i later squabble over , a source of major disagreements
0	i gave him a fine welcome
0	two swift-footed hunting dogs accompanied him
0	make sure you greet nestor for me ,
0	to great zeus ' daughter , and quickly lifting up
0	when they had made the oath
0	a man skilled in shaping horn had worked on them , to fit the horns together to create a bow
0	since we first drove them back to ilion , i have not stopped fighting as hard as i know how , cutting men down with my bow and killing them
0	then swift-footed achilles spoke to priam , in a joking tone :
0	my spirit is not resolute
0	all people gazed at him
0	i wished to hold the shade of my dead mother
0	dragged through this lovely home
0	for i do not think
0	my heart was firm
0	i can fetch some sweet wine for you , so you can start by pouring a libationto father zeus and other deathless gods
0	peiraeus was the first to speak :
0	who live forever , take your vengeance now
0	odius pitched forward with a thud , his armour rattling round him as he fell
0	a child of dolius , but penelope had raised her ,
0	i made it back
0	standing up among the argives , achilles said :
0	while the two lapiths were stripping shining armour from the dead , young troops with polydamas and hector , the most numerous and bravest of the men , the ones most keen to breach the wall and burn the ships ,
0	really troubled him and made him old
0	if i stay right here
0	eurynomus , was with the suitors
0	odysseus spoke to them , testing the swineherd ,
0	you may get back to ithaca , although
0	once the gods had changed the wind 's direction , it seemed that he could make it safely back
0	white-armed goddess hera , as soon as she would heard this , spoke to hephaestus , her dear son :
0	after a pause , old horseman phoenix spoke :
0	that famous lady hippodameia borepolypoetes to perithous on that very day he took revenge out on those hairy monsters , and beat them from mount pelion towards the aithices
0	peleus ' son went after him , sure of his speed on foot
0	achilles , fully armed , climbed up beside him ,
0	set off to battle , then—show you are a man , the fine man you claimed to be before
0	molus later gave it to his son meriones
0	my friend , since you are the first one i have encountered here , my greetings to you , and may you meet me
0	my friend , leave your arrows and your bow—set them down , since some god has broken themto spite danaans
0	as a poet , he shows us first a wonderfully complicated legal knot , which the judge , link by link , undoes , in the process destroying himself
0	when everyone had eaten food and drunk
0	the boy immediately shrank back against the breast of the finely girdled nurse , crying out in terrorto see his own dear father , scared at the sight of bronze , the horse-hair plume nodding fearfully from his helmet top
0	what was the immense need out of which such an illuminating group of olympic beings arose ?
0	and on the eighteenth day some shadowy hills appeared , where the land of the phaeacians , like a shield
0	onto the close-set timbers , then finished it
0	some distance from the hearth and quickly turned around towards the darkness
0	then he advanced—the troops moved up behind him , making a huge din , even from soldiers at the back
0	fine , large creatures , with thick fleecy coats
0	on my journey home
0	just as fig juiceadded quickly to white milk clots it at once ,
0	with no sense of injury , then strangers
0	each had thrown his spear and missed , wasting the throw
0	the lions , after ripping open the great ox 's hide ,
0	was bringing alector 's daughter home to sparta
0	then godlike paris stepped out , as trojan champion , on his shoulders a leopard skin
0	odysseus 's knees gave way , his spirit fell , and in great distress he spoke aloud , addressing his great heart :
0	i will speak to you quite openly , concealing nothing
0	stranger , stories told in dreams are difficult—
0	he lived with us when he arrived from cythera
0	i would no longer have a chance to get awayfrom death , my fate
0	he looked like a young man
0	and drown at sea or just keep going in silence ,
0	she placed some grains of barley in a basket
0	for that 's a dead man 's right
0	hector 's swift-footed horses carried him and his weapons back , leaving behind , against their will , the trojans held up at the trench dug by achaeans
0	and clothing , too , a greater hoard of goods
0	but since gods have ordained these evil things , i wish i would been wife to a better man , someone sensitive to others ' insults , with feeling for his many shameful acts
0	among them all , the father of gods and men was first to speak
0	but now you are fully grown ,
0	and having my feet washed brings no delight
0	yet we were comforted by indications that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss the german spirit still rests and dreams , undestroyed , in glorious health , profundity and dionysian strength , like a knight sunk in slumber ; and from this abyss the dionysian song rises to our ears to let us know that this german knight is still dreaming his primordial dionysian myth in blissfully serious visions
0	the horses came behind
0	nestor set horses , chariots , and charioteers in front
0	in my own home , you will hear
0	hector was gagging painfully , dazed and vomiting blood
0	no other beggar or stranger listens in
0	still wasting his resources
0	that 's how we held the red-hot pointed stake
0	all my other fine companions perished there ,
0	three sons of alcinous stepped out , as well—halius , laodomas ,
0	then she wrapped around herself a heavenly robe , which athena made for her from silky fabric , adorning it with gorgeous embroidery
0	the ship 's stern started to catch fire
0	it 's been three years now—
0	he were a god
0	so we asked a god to give us a sign
0	nothing further here , even though his rage
0	wise penelope , daughter of icarius , we do not think
0	with his right hand he grabbed her by the throat , and with the other pulled her closer to him
0	once odysseus spoke , they all took steady aim ,
0	then antilochus stripped spoils from mermerus and phalces
0	came quickly to the island of the sirens
0	other than achilles no one used it to drink gleaming wine
0	to one of the other haughty kings—
0	but they could not string it—whatever strength they had
0	you have no wish to go into the blacksmith 's home
0	i , on one side , holding out my sword
0	and mocked the cyclops :
0	their numbers now are more than one can count—
0	approaching him , he spoke—his words had wings :
0	and now it sat there , covering odysseus ' head
0	seeking to become your mother 's husband ,
0	now , if you leave these animals unharmed
0	they rushed outside and beat their breasts around warlike achilles
0	but after so many of the finest trojans died , many achaeans , too , though many did survive , in the war 's tenth year , priam 's city was destroyed
0	only this time the chorus of spectators had to have practice
0	no man alive on earth could now fight them
0	in this connection , the chorus of witches [ in goethe 's faust ] says :
0	within her heart the disastrous folly
0	once they would been released from their strong chains , both gods jumped up immediately—ares went off to thrace ,
0	not even from that place
0	there in the hall , until the sun goes down
0	here speaks to us only a full , indeed a triumphant , existence , in which everything present is worshipped , no matter whether it is good or evil
0	youunhappy man , your heart 's had to endure so many evils
0	he always sat furthest away ,
0	and tied his feet and hands with heart-wrenching bonds
0	soldiers from bouprasium , fair elis , those partsbounded by hyrmine , coastal myrsinus , the rock of olene , and alesium—these troops had four commanders , each with ten swift ships
0	but then he got away from fate and drove the bellowing herd from phylace
0	i would not advise him to go against you , lord of the dark cloud , but to follow you , wherever you might lead
0	then she lay back and got some rest , and all her limbs relaxed
0	then , with sorrowful hearts , they went in person
0	they unhitched the mules , then brought the clothes inside
0	my friends , consider both sides of this issue
0	from things no man has seen
0	this finely crafted mixing bowl
0	i will arm myself and hand out other armour
0	whom anyone would pray for as a son
0	no , let 's quickly end our quarrel , leavingthese mortal men to fight amongst themselves
0	goddess athena with the gleaming eyes answered him :
0	you must go first of all to see the swineherd ,
0	to be allotted ten
0	and i asked about each one
0	argives were not driven back to their black ships by ares or by bronze-armed hector
0	for both of us she kept watch at the doors
0	but what was i to do ?
0	the son of cronos cast a thick mist down on their glittering helmets , for zeus had not felt hostile to patroclus in earlier days , when he was alive and comrade to achilles
0	the first to spot themwas idomeneus , leader of the cretans
0	will furnish a fast ship for you and come
0	at that moment , cloud-gatherer zeus spoke to apollo :
0	i answered him at once :
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered her and said :
0	those men were sorry for their comrade , but could not help—
0	so the complete destruction of the suitors
0	still , castor , son of hylax , the man
0	with him in mind , zeus addressed the gods :
0	as you have made to him , praying you might reach
0	to everyone , and sends out messages
0	we know well enough how strong you are—invincible
0	no joy of her
0	speaking these winged words to her :
0	we have not had to go without our shareof feasts , either in agamemnon 's hut , atreus ' son , or here , for you have prepareda richly satisfying meal
0	after the ram had moved
0	then call your crew
0	we went to pylos and reached nestor ,
0	cinched up his sword , closed his fist around a spear , moved close beside his father , right by his seat , and stood there , fully armed with glittering bronze
0	i will remain like this till sunset ,
0	nor will i take them lightly
0	gave them their skills in famous handicrafts
0	for the godsare terrifying when they reveal themselves
0	it knocks aside all fine things built by farmers , hard-working men
0	for he 's just come home
0	to enjoy our youth and reach together
0	you know how his appearance in the hall
0	thanks to hermes the messenger , the one
0	or any of the servants in this house
0	as they made their plea to great zeus ' daughter , hector went to the fine house of alexander
0	we never spent the night on shore , but sailed
0	we must stride right into the midst of those battles which , as i have just said , are being waged in the loftiest spheres of our present world between the insatiably optimistic desire to know and the artistic need for tragedy
0	there he found phaeacian counselors and leaders
0	and then kill him
0	choice offerings to the gods
0	and thus stands out among those in assembly
0	bronze walls extended out beyond the threshold
0	but these men had not come through unscathed
0	but he blocked the way to the swift ships for all of them
0	and for the nymphs
0	you have made me so worked up
0	she raced down from the peak of mount olympus ,
0	to the hollow ships , if one man , well versed
0	but they stayed silent
0	in deep thick woods , for he could track a scent
0	by contrast , the images of the lyric poet are nothing but himself and , as it were , only different objectifications of himself
0	the old man plunged back in the surging sea
0	her words had wings
0	the polished spear point sailed over his right shoulder , then stuck in the ground
0	to send him out across the sea 's broad back
0	so we groaned , and stayed there waiting for bright dawn
0	and ask him questions about everything , both those who are grieving for their ruler ,
0	as the masses threw themselves at his feet , he nonetheless , with a sublime act of defiance , threw his own individual attitudes in their faces , those same attitudes with which he had conquered the masses
0	insulting odysseus , to make his comrades laugh
0	all through the wretched night , with my eye on
0	another man who , as a host , provides
0	fathered brave oicles , who then produced
0	so the two men helped themselves , eating the fine meal prepared and set before them
0	with these words , penelope raised a sacred cry ,
0	go call the stranger
0	so you must care for
0	the veil the goddess gave him and let the river
0	some distance off , he prayed to lord apollo , leto 's fair-haired child :
0	holding him back against his will
0	he sent me off
0	i will give in to you freely , though unwillingly
0	when the great bow was in odysseus ' hands ,
0	the man is really strong , much more powerful than other men
0	i promise he will pay you everything ,
0	in his distress he addressed his own brave heart :
0	in their swift ships to carry them across
0	how i wish all of helen 's relatives
0	then idomeneus struck oenomaus in the stomach , smashing the front plate on his body armour
0	he would have stayed here
0	into the wide hellespont , so that men ,
0	then , with your attendants
0	but pallas athena stopped it from sinking into any vital organ
0	honoured him with all their hearts , just as if
0	then athena , eyes glittering , took her brother , headstrong ares , by the hand , and said to him :
0	immortal gods have set a proper time
0	none of the rivers was left out , except oceanus , nor any nymph
0	in case my comrades , overcome with fear ,
0	the other warriors , all those who had escaped
0	you are a passionate woman—why is it
0	nestor took the well-made shield belonging to his son , horse-taming thrasymedes
0	alas , unconquerable child of zeus , who bears the aegis , the argives will flee , go back home to their dear native land , cross the wide sea , abandoning helen , an argive woman , leaving in triumphpriam and his trojans
0	fair-haired menelaus went out after them
0	wishes to evade his death and lethal fate ,
0	hector grabbed hold of a seaworthy ship , at the stern , the fine fast boat which brought protesilaus to troy , though it did not take him back to his own native land
0	but then athena , goddess with the glittering eyes , thought of something else
0	were driven by those wicked blasts of wind
0	but euripides was , to some extent , only a mask
0	seeing that , lord odysseus filled up his cup with wine and proposed a toast :
0	father zeus , ruling from mount ida , mighty , all-powerful , of these two men , let the one who brought this war to both sides be killed and then go down to hades ' house
0	father zeus drove his fine-wheeled chariot and horses
0	he saved my life
0	as she led them quickly from the city
0	but for me this is much better , and for him , too , that before we came to blows he backed off , away from my hands , despite his anger
0	it 's not ordained that you are to die here , killed by some river , which will soon recede , as you will see
0	for by that stone wall blazing fires broke out everywhere
0	if i did not do that , then her father
0	the two of them wo not stand apart for long
0	who came from your companions , met me , a herald
0	damastor 's son , by eurynomus , amphimedon ,
0	right in the vanguard , the typical greek youth , plato , prostrated himself before socrates 's picture with all the fervent adoration of his passionately enthusiastic soul
0	leaders and counselors of the phaeacians ,
0	in fact , i am asking you to do it
0	when goddess athena with her glittering eyessaw argives being slaughtered in the battle frenzy , she rushed down from olympus heights to sacred ilion
0	destroys them , once our spirit flies from us , from our white bones
0	tomorrow morning early give him a bath
0	you will not lack clothes or any other thing
0	your heart must stay alert , so you do not suffer harm
0	and killed her wedded husband—among men
0	let each grown woman get ready a large fire in her home
0	night came on , bringing storms
0	but now you must go home
0	and rub him down with oil , so he will be ready
0	then he grabbed two heavy bronze-tipped spears
0	and they agreed with what he would said
0	i roused my shipmates and ordered them aboard
0	then i would still agree
0	you will make us crash !
0	on a promontory projecting out
0	rams and billy goats
0	my father is a wealthy man , owns lots of things—bronze , silver , well-worked iron
0	on every one i burned fat and thighs of oxen— i was so keen to conquer troy , its well-made walls
0	had gone to dodona to find out there ,
0	here we have demonstrated the one possible relationship between poetry and music , word and tone : word , image , and idea look for metaphorical expression in music and experience the power of music
0	and he was helped by my accursed wife ,
0	i will go as well to help you , so with all speed
0	arising from the mixing bowl was sweet ,
0	you have destroyed our beautiful world with your mighty fist
0	standing close to menelaus , he spoke to him—
0	telemachus , it seems one of the women in the house
0	for then its disciples would have to feel like those people who want to dig a hole straight through the earth , and one among them sees that , even with the greatest lifelong effort , he is in a position to dig through only a really small piece of the immense depths , and that piece will be covered over in front of his very eyes by the work of the person next to him , so that a third person would apparently do well to select a new place for the tunneling efforts he undertakes on his own initiative
0	poseidon , and to periboea ,
0	then the lovely goddess
0	i could see no evidence
0	pallas athena took up the reins and whip
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	a home , a plot of land , a wedded wife
0	in his heart he smiled with bitter scorn
0	they tied me up with tightly twisted rope
0	while the females , who had not been milked
0	if i tried , i would be hopeless , a man
0	and so , stranger , the name of ithaca is even known in troy ,
0	i do not think you will make it back yourself—
0	under the direction of their husbands
0	it was very beautiful , the loveliest object in the world by far
0	take a year or more to fly back from there
0	he hurled his load
0	scattered the achaeans , i never saw you ,
0	a change in seasons , the new year rolled in ,
0	there 's no city there
0	with a scowl , odysseus , that resourceful man , then answered euryalus :
0	let no one hear odysseus is back home
0	these they covered in a double layer of fat
0	so the two moved straight ahead , guarding their shoulders under bull 's hide shields , tanned and tough , with thick bronze hammered out on top
0	my father , too , the one who sired me
0	except those times when east or south wind blew
0	so in answer to noemon ,
0	but still , even now i think i will push him
0	in the air among the clouds
0	about a pilot for your ship
0	if you bid me choose a companion for myself , how could i reject godlike odysseus , with his heart and daring spirit always eagerfor every challenge ?
0	such an ill-fated man ever was alive ?
0	so i wo not exhaust you and your comrades
0	old man , what you have just said is true and relevant
0	despite his sorrow , antilochus did not forget his comrade
0	let 's get agreementfrom all of you to end this matter quickly
0	but they would built it without sanction from immortal gods—they would made no splendid offering , no sacrifices to the gods , asking them to keeptheir swift ships safe , so the wall soon fell apart
0	there the graces bathed and then anointed her
0	mighty diomedes scowled at dolon and said :
0	setting in her heart the prudent words her son had said
0	we would better save him
0	with his fine hands a spacious bed—fallen leaves were all around , enough to cover two or three
0	a carver lifted platters with all sorts of meat
0	in this way , the two men conversed with one another
0	far-seeing zeus steals half the value of a man
0	he strode ahead and quickly reached the royal palace
0	there he left him , leaning against the courtyard wall with his stick in his hands
0	as much as i do—you have brought to an end
0	cloud-gatherer zeus then answered him and said :
0	the man who hits it , that quivering dove , can carry offall these double axes
0	when swift-footed godlike achilles had stripped the corpse , standing among achaeans , he spoke these winged words :
0	let each of you
0	soon dawn arrived on her golden throne
0	well , i will make a start
0	then went at ctesippus and said :
0	they will pay you honours like a god
0	this dishonourable man had a son with much more virtuous qualities— he could run fast and was an excellent fighter , and for his mind among the best in mycenae
0	saying this , athena grabbed sthenelus ' hand and hauled him from the chariot to the ground
0	but sweet sleep did not visit zeus , tossing and turning over in his mind some way to honour achilles , by slaughtering many soldiers by the achaean ships
0	patroclus fell with a crash , and achaea 's army was filled with anguish
0	with these words , she turned her sure-footed horses back
0	come now , tell me this—
0	then patroclus stood in the doorway , like some god
0	there was no easy way horses pulling chariots with wheels could move across
0	down a smooth plank , chest first into the sea
0	it 's their last stand
0	they drove me to wage this wretched waragainst achaeans
0	with indomitable courage , as you did
0	a people who know nothing of the sea ,
0	geranian horseman nestor then answered telemachus and said :
0	they will carry you across the tranquil sea ,
0	leiodes , that speech that passed the barrier of your teeth , what wretched , sorry words !
0	you argives , are we really going to give the victoryto hector , son of priam—allow himto take our ships and get the glory ?
0	it was in bloom
0	so i went in with her ,
0	or setting anchor stones , or tying up
0	what sort of artistic style would we have if from this the idea of the spectator we derived , as its essential form , the spectator in himself ( the pure spectator )
0	do not fear aresor any other immortal deity
0	has cut that olive tree down at its base
0	old men now , their fighting days were finished , but they all spoke well
0	if down in hades men forget their dead , even there i will remember my companion
0	the fire has breathed on them too many times
0	the virgins who move solemnly to apollo 's temple with laurel branches in their hands singing a processional song as they go , remain who they are and retain their names as citizens
0	he looked out at troy , at the achaean ships , at the flashing bronze , at warriors killing , and at warriors being killed
0	can yet boast they and their ship sailed past her without getting hurt
0	the building of that wooden horse , the one
0	but how suddenly the desert of our exhausted culture , just described in such gloomy terms , is changed when it is touched by the dionysian magic !
0	then iris came as messenger to white-armed helen , taking on the image of her sister-in-law , wife of antenor 's son , fine helicaon
0	the son of peleus , from the other side ,
0	if you start to beg your men , or order them , to let you go ,
0	if he wo not obey my orders and ignores them , he should consider in his mind and heartthis point—no matter how mighty he may be , he ca not stand up to me if i attack him
0	follow a single line
0	begging scraps—no need for sword or cauldron
0	and there is forested mount neriton
0	of our returning army , no details
0	crafty odysseus , with a smile , then asked dolon :
0	eighth came the fair briseis
0	will sap his strength before he comes of age
0	about my dear father 's journey home ,
0	pelias lived in spacious iolcus ,
0	as much as they could wish , entreating them ,
0	but pallas athena refused their prayer
0	let hector see how my hand wields a spear
0	they set off chasing him with speed
0	by the ships ' sterns ?
0	gaea ( or gaia ) is the earth , the child of chaos
0	mentor , do not let what odysseus says convince you
0	he glared at him , then , with a scowl , replied—his words had wings :
0	the soldiers all grew silent
0	returning from these hortatory tones to the mood befitting contemplation , i repeat that we can learn only from the greeks what such an almost miraculously sudden awakening of tragedy means for the innermost life ground of a people
0	so the son of peleus spoke , throwing to the ground the sceptre with the golden studs
0	from the place he took four shields , eight spears , and four bronze helmets with thick horsehair plumes
0	the most remote of people
0	athena stirred up the conflict , coming down from heaven , sent by wide-seeing zeus to urge on the danaans
0	and men say that he 's a mortal , although zeus , cronos ’ son , gives him glory
0	planting my foot , i pulled my bronze spear
0	sit down for a meeting , so i can speak
0	but if you hold back from war , or with your words convince some other manto turn away from battle , you die right then , struck by my spear
0	at once he spoke out to patroclus , his companion , calling him beside the ship
0	then leocritus , son of euenor , spoke in reply :
0	on the other route there are two cliffs
0	the time has come for me to send you off
0	for my limbs and feet are no longer firm , my friend
0	he 's inviting them to fight , not to a dance
0	among these warriors , as they armed themselves some distance off , menelaus strode—confident , courageous—rousing his troops for war , his heart passionateto avenge helen 's struggles , her cries of pain
0	his dark blood gushed out , soaking the earth
0	with sexual desire , and their legs grew weak
0	he led in priam with the wagon load of priceless gifts
0	but agamemnon killed him on the ground
0	i ca not fight youwhen you burn with flames like this
0	to the fine flowing spring artacia ,
0	i was going to tell you ,
0	the swineherd , that outstanding man , then answered him :
0	you two ajaxes , argive leaders , and you , meriones , let each man bear in mind the kindnesses of poor patroclus , who , when he was alive , knew how to treat every man with care
0	he brought with him an enormous ransom , carried in his hands the sacred golden staffwith the shawl of archer god apollo
0	that 's how you are
0	you arrogant trojans , who ca not get enough of war 's destructive noise , this is the wayyou will go back from these ships of the danaans , who ride fast horses
0	that women in some strange and far-off land
0	what then did schopenhauer think about tragedy ?
0	as he stood there , he cried out
0	are beautiful—that 's how that unmarried girl
0	it may be you will find aegisthus is still living there , or else orestes has preceded you
0	is not far off , as you will quickly learn
0	he and war-loving menelaus here will fight it out alone between the armiesfor helen and for all her property
0	next , fierce warrior polypoetes killed astyalus
0	but his sharp arrow had not killed diomedes , who moved back to stand beside his chariot and horses
0	shrewd odysseus scowled at them and gave his answer :
0	who wished to make odysseus her husband
0	and through his tears he spoke winged words to him :
0	they themselves then disembarked in the crashing surf , to prepare a meal and mix the gleaming wine
0	and a powerful spear , as well
0	it 's more important , too—if i do kill them ,
0	though he was short and wore cloth armour , among all hellenes and achaeans he excelled in fighting with his spear
0	i am not concerned so muchabout patroclus ' corpse , which soon enough will be food for trojan dogs and birds , but i fear for my own head , and yours , as well , which may be in danger
0	through the iron : as mentioned in the note at , the challenge required the
0	the faint image then answered penelope and said :
0	and make her happy , by staying in the room
0	resourceful odysseus scowled and said to her :
0	so say your prayers to our father , lord poseidon
0	from another place—she has no respect
0	for i will make a truthful prophecy
0	to give great glory to the trojans
0	i would give you a home
0	but then , when penelope
0	you shall accompany the dionysian pageant from india to greece
0	who noticed and could hear his heavy sighs
0	so these men worked hard to bring that body from the battle to the hollow ships , in the face of a fierce conflict , like some fire suddenly rushing at a city full of people ,
0	we saw a high cave , overhung with laurel
0	even if you descend to the lowest placebeneath the earth and sea , where iapetusand cronos live , where they get no pleasurein any sunlight from hyperion , or any breeze , in the depths of tartarus— even if you went as far away as thatin your wandering , i would still pay no attentionto your displeasure
0	this is no meal where each man brings his share
0	but how can i rejoin that conflict ?
0	will make our hearts united even more
0	their bronze-tipped spears , in the fighting there around the corpse of peleus 's dead son
0	in the same shape you saw him go to sleep , then , warrior king , you can relax your grip and let the old man go
0	much against their will ,
0	you idiotic stranger , you are a man
0	might well observe that you are a rich man 's son
0	in case another man might eat a lotus
0	then bring them to the house , and be happy
0	when this voice came , it always sounded a cautionary note
0	while they kept laughing , the men prepared a meal ,
0	do not let trojansdestroy achaeans in this way
0	mother , why begrudge the faithful singer
0	you are wearing different clothes , your skin has changed
0	on the basis of this most significant way of understanding all aesthetics , which , taken seriously , marks the first beginning of aesthetics , richard wagner , to confirm its lasting truth , set his stamp , when he established in his beethoven that music must be assessed on aesthetic principles entirely different from those for all fine arts and not at all according to the category of beauty , although an erroneous aesthetics , in the service of a misleading and degenerate art , has become accustomed to the idea of beauty asserting itself in the world of images and to demand from music an effect similar to the effect of plastic arts , namely , the arousal of satisfaction in beautiful forms
0	blows cold in early morning
0	to fight a man who acts with violence
0	of all the female household slaves she was the one who loved him most , for she had nursed him as a child
0	athena , with apollo of the silver bow , perched in the lofty oak tree sacred to zeus , who bears the aegis , looking like two vultures , set to enjoy the unfolding human action
0	our boat sailed on its course , but not for long
0	already in euripides , when his heroes or chorus first start to sing , things get really out of hand
0	then strain to push it uphill to the top
0	like a diver , cebriones toppled over , out of the well-made chariot
0	their bodies looked like swine—but their minds
0	and on sweet wine
0	sorted into separate groups , with yearlings ,
0	he drove the bronze spear straight through the man
0	we claim we are far better than our fathers
0	according to the ideas of lucretius , the marvelous divine shapes first appeared to the mind of man in a dream
0	by their greater numbers , i would rather die ,
0	you did not pay attention to your fathers ,
0	but he first discovered evil in himself ,
0	he mad use of this tragedy as dante made use of vergil , in order to be conducted to the gates of paradise ; while from this point he continued unassisted and passed over from an imitation of the highest greek art-form to a restoration of all things , to an imitation of man 's original art-world
0	in the same place schopenhauer also described for us the monstrous horror which seizes a man when he suddenly doubts the ways of comprehending illusion , when the sense of a foundation , in any one of its forms , appears to suffer a breakdown
0	think of going back , to the hollow ships , son of great-hearted tydeus , in case you get driven there in quick retreat , if some other god wakes up the trojans
0	for all guests and beggars come from zeus ,
0	a bright stream flows out underneath a cave
0	the rest are young ,
0	and circe , too , on aeaea
0	but i might force you out into the fields
0	i picked three at a time
0	a female servant carried in a fine gold jug
0	the old man trembled , then ordered his attendants to prepare his chariot
0	with sons who are , in turn , intelligent
0	then nestor addressed the argives , shouting :
0	dead men on the hard earth all around him ,
0	they left melanthius there , tied up and hanging in bonds which would destroy him
0	just as smoke rises up , reaching spacious heaven , when a city burns from fires set by wrathful gods— that 's how achilles brought the trojans death and danger
0	instruct athena to go immediatelywhere trojans and achaeans carry ontheir bitter conflict
0	all the women raised their hands , praying to athena , while theano took that lovely robe and placed it in athena 's lap , the goddess with the lovely hair , then spoke out this prayer to great zeus ' daughter : blessed athena , sacred goddess , defender of our city , break the spear of diomedes
0	his handsome looks and shape
0	when helen had stirred in the drug and told them to serve out the wine , she rejoined the conversation and spoke up once again :
0	wiped with porous sponges soaked in water
0	raising their hands , each man prayed fervently to all the gods
0	after him came forward mighty diomedes , son of tydeus , driving those yoked horses from tros ' herd , which he would just taken from aeneas , though apollo had snatched away their owner
0	in what painful confusion must the cultured class of such a period gaze at the phenomenon which perhaps is to be comprehended analogically only by means of the profoundest principle of the hitherto unintelligible hellenic genius -- the phenomenon of the reawakening of the dionysian spirit and the rebirth of tragedy ?
0	may these suitors here
0	he says that you have here with you a man
0	who shows him hospitality ?
0	and take my life or a storm wind would come ,
0	when the two men , standing on each side with their troops , had armed themselves , they strode out to the open space between the trojans and achaeans , staring ferociously
0	even one whose actions are done well
0	onboard a well-decked ship and send them off
0	all sorts of tricks , the way a man will do
0	in silence : the doorway in question is the entrance to the women 's quarters
0	that 's what mighty ajax ordered
0	hector , my heart and my proud spirit prompt meto volunteer to sneak up to those fast ships and find out what i can
0	courage in his heart , so he might talk about
0	resourceful odysseus then moved back and replied :
0	perhaps some wrapping you had for the clothes
0	now may zeus , loud-thundering mate of hera ,
0	the people in the palace were all silent ,
0	he looked after him , surrounding him with love , as if he were his son
0	in the city instead of in the fields
0	so some other beggar will be careful to avoid deception
0	did not please agamemnon in the least ,
0	not in the least , for this is why you have sailed
0	son of atreus , this would be your last offence
0	then sweet sleep released me
0	twenty of the best
0	you should sit here for now
0	it would be impossible for me to tell
0	for of all towns inhabited by earth 's peoples , under the sun , beneath the heavenly stars , sacred ilion , with priam and his people , expert spearmen , stands dearest in my heart
0	where are you from ?
0	under his own roof , he and the suitors
0	he sat a long time silent
0	he came along as well ,
0	feeling pity for them , zeus spoke to athena— his words had wings :
0	his eyes were full of tears , his mind transfixed with sorrow
0	in all of ithaca
0	its roots were crackling in fire
0	so let us go ,
0	was not appropriate for suitors in the past
0	then walked along the shore beside the sea
0	the force his supple limbs possessed before
0	you achaeans have often criticizedand spoken ill of me
0	it landed there beside his feet
0	and the keeper of the goats , so they could
0	byyour knees , achilles , i beg you to respect me as a suppliant
0	they were extremely angry with him ,
0	earthshaker poseidon broke my ship apart—
0	of his own household
0	bulls and rams—and was sitting at a banquet ,
0	for my companions who remained behind
0	but i fear them here , where we may experience disaster , because of hector , who leads their charge
0	herald , why did my son leave ?
0	we should not move out , in case some men here
0	when he would gone to the lapiths
0	great ajax kept on trying to throw his spear at bronze-armed hector
0	along with forty fig trees
0	then shrewd telemachus spoke up in reply ,
0	poseidon sat there , beside the other gods , wrapping a concealing cloudaround their shoulders
0	so we can make a tasty meal here in the hut
0	the loud-voiced herald , standing in their midst , spoke out :
0	for achilles was the better man by far
0	third leader was diores , son of amarynces
0	where the shepherd of his people placed his millstones
0	approaching him , geranian horseman nestor shoved him with his foot , waking him up
0	before i ever came to ithaca ,
0	come on , let ’ s see how much gold and silver
0	the only life it feeds is bleating goats
0	that 's in your power
0	let 's give him a large tripod and a cauldron ,
0	glorious achilles , lie your white bones ,
0	now evil death is here , right beside me , not somewhere far away
0	they go to sleep beside their faithful wives ,
0	zarathustra the dancer , zarathustra the light hearted , who beckons with his wings , a man ready to fly , hailing all birds , prepared and ready , a careless and blessed man
0	aeneas , leader of the trojans , then replied :
0	next , she asked noemon , fine son of phronius ,
0	like a boy and girl chatting by some rock or oak tree , as they flirt with one another
0	so come on now ,
0	lying on the ground
0	you must be offering a sign to someone
0	whichever way you look , even if you really try , you can not tellfrom what direction we are being attacked
0	hides a torch underneath black embers , and thus saves a spark of fire , so he wo not need to kindle it
0	everything was calm and bright around them
0	they placed the yoke with care across the polished pole at its front end , then set the rope 's eye on the peg and bound it up securely with three twists round the knob
0	yes indeed , she still lives in your palace ,
0	sailing across the wine-dark sea to men
0	we must not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen -- if society , leavened to the very lowest strata by this kind of culture , gradually begins to tremble with wanton agitations and desires , if the belief in the earthly happiness of all , if the belief in the possibility of such a general intellectual culture changes into the threatening demand for such an alexandrian earthly happiness , into the conjuring up of a euripidean deus ex machina
0	fair-haired menelaus , very annoyed by what he would heard , replied :
0	i am a poor wretch , but what i have to say ,
0	towards the land , and , like a tidal flood ,
0	anyone like you—either man or woman
0	the flying bronzegrazed the metal with a rasping sound
0	he was , as it turned out , searching
0	troops rallied once more and turned to face achaeans
0	the envoys approached , lord odysseus in the lead
0	when he noticed them , he went back inside the house , to tell the shepherd of his people what he would seen
0	than any other suitor , and now he 's going
0	your glorious fame , achilles , will endure
0	no , three times no !
0	for he has his own sons
0	they sped off quickly , keen to move on through the city toward the plain
0	in his rage he may harm achaean troops—passions run high in kings whom zeus supports
0	the merit you possess , in your anger
0	dolon 's head rolled in the dust , as he was speaking
0	once they would quickly covered up the sturdy bed ,
0	once he finished speaking , noemon went away ,
0	for those in times to come
0	so they made their way to the assembly ground
0	mighty agamemnonspoke to him and said :
0	he denied me nothing and helped me go
0	to reach a ripe old age in his own home ,
0	this herald and the swineherd met because they would both been sent off with the same report to tell the queen
0	men who destroyed his ships and well-armed comrades , all of them , and how odysseus was the only one
0	you cruel man , how will any of the countless other men
0	this is a great disgrace , which people will learn about in years to come—how an achaean force of such quality and size vainly sailed off to fight a lesser force , and failed to get what they set out to take
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	in the mule cart she saw the corpse lying on the bier
0	in ploughing fallow land
0	he then spoke out among the suitors :
0	although you live a long way off , you have heard
0	but , as the circling years kept moving past me ,
0	i would not show such grief if he were dead ,
0	and struck the gray sea with their oars
0	the fierce gusts of howling winds snapped the mast off in the middle
0	and nestor 's son was really eager
0	now i greet you
0	he gave me splendid gifts—
0	is that why you are here , you and your devious trickery ?
0	i do not have a cloak
0	they can do that—
0	the others died through their own foolishness
0	laertes said a prayer
0	these words of mine won over their proud hearts
0	for the killing of her son
0	each one of us
0	so i wander aimlessly round hades ' homeby its wide gates
0	then appeared the ghost of my dead mother ,
0	with those monsters spearing men like fish ,
0	my ship is berthed some distance from the city ,
0	you know well enough , divinely bred old man , what he 's like—not someone to take lightly
0	but what is the origin of this enigmatic trait that the suffering and the fate of the hero , the most painful triumphs , the most agonizing oppositions of motives , in short , the exemplification of this wisdom of silenus , or , to put it aesthetically , that which is ugly and disharmonic , is represented ever anew in such countless forms and with such a distinct preference -- and precisely in the most fruitful and youthful period of a people ?
0	then he made him leg guards of finely hammered tin
0	then great telamonian ajax roused the argives :
0	but if he 's the mani think he is , the fierce son of tydeus , he could not be charging at us in this way without help from some god beside him , an immortal with a covering cloudaround his shoulders , the god who pushed asidethat sharp arrow which struck diomedes
0	but still i wish ,
0	even if he lies here an entire year , his flesh will stay just as it is or better
0	father , now i will bring you
0	fair winds began to blow behind our dark-prowed ship ,
0	along with philoetius and eumaeus ,
0	and honours him , no matter where he goes ,
0	either they did not come with the contingentfrom lovely lacedaemon , or they sailed here in their seaworthy ships , but have no wish to join men 's battles , fearing the disgrace , the many slurs , which are justly mine
0	seeing this , agamemnon , king of men , spoke out , rebuking them
0	my husband and his fine companions there ,
0	so first of all they bathed and put on tunics
0	they were some distance from the other people ,
0	all sorts of treasure , woven goods and gold ,
0	and then they quickly went back to their dear father 's home
0	i can reveal the truth of this as well
0	and caused me pain
0	then with their talons they attacked each other , clawing head and neck , and flew off on the right , past people 's homes , across the city
0	i am the only one who can make the claim
0	behind them , trojans soldiers gave a shout , as they saw achaeans hoisting up the corpse
0	father , surely one of the eternal gods
0	a mound , raised a pillar , then planted there ,
0	but if his heart knows of some prophecythat he 's avoiding , something from zeushis mother 's mentioned to him , then at least let him send you to war , in commandof other myrmidons—it may beyou will prove a saving light to the danaans
0	i will stay here and bear whatever troubles come ,
0	though i pitied you before , in my home
0	to build up walls and planting lofty trees ?
0	never interact with us
0	horse-breaking cadmeans were upset with him
0	pale fear gripped them all
0	with a phaeacian crew was sailing back
0	they howled and ran at him , barking furiously
0	just as a mountain snake waits for some man right by its lair , after eating poison herbs so that a savage anger grips him , as he coils beside his den with a fearful glare— that 's how hector 's dauntless heart would not retreat
0	the killer of argus , the gods ' great messenger ,
0	unless , goddess , you ’ ll agree to swear
0	the day we would seized the sacred citadel
0	perhaps your husband , the son of cronos , has frightened you ?
0	just as dogs maintain a tired watch over their sheep in some farm yard , when they hear a savage beast , who 's just moved down from wooded hills , men and dogs raising a din around it , so those dogs get no rest , that 's how sweet sleep had left those sentries ' eyelids , as they kept guard that wretched night , always turning
0	hector ran under the walls of troy , limbs working feverishly
0	as for me , may i go down to hades ' home , before i seethis city plundered and destroyed
0	on the eighteenth we gave you to the fire
0	achilles spoke—his words had wings
0	ignoring all the others , hera took the cup of fair-cheeked themis , the first who came running up to meet her
0	cauldrons , gold , and splendid clothing
0	hecuba took outone of the gowns , the finest embroidery , the largest
0	but come , let all of you now swear this solemn oath—
0	first , he moved around and spurred on lycia 's leading men in every spot to rally round sarpedon
0	then take it off and throw it far from land into the wine-dark sea
0	he would drawn out his sharp sword , to see if he would somehow yield the door to him
0	so every day i would weave at the big loom
0	i lacked the courage then to fight with you , as you attacked
0	he 's well disposed to you and loves your son and wise penelope
0	all the kings applauded horse-taming diomedes
0	when that spear struck adamas , he doubled up , bent down over the spear , writhing like a bull which farmers in the mountains bind with willow shoots and drag along by force , against the creature 's will
0	oh , how i wish
0	warlike meriones , running up , yanked out his spear
0	she spoke to him once more and said :
0	zeus no longer turned his radiant eyes toward troy , for in his heart he did not believe a single one of the immortal gods would move to give assistance to the trojans or danaans
0	he threw on the fire enduring bronze and tin , precious gold and silver
0	i have placed them well beyond the smoke , since they are no longer
0	hit him up close
0	we sacrificed fine beasts to zeus almighty , a bull to poseidon , and one to alpheius
0	and are lying there , having sex together ,
0	nor was i killed
0	seeing paris , hector spoke some sharp words to him :
0	does not quickly come to stand against you
0	he stood bewildered , shifted his seven-layered shield onto his back , turned , looked round at throngs of trojans , like some wild beast , then backed off step by step , retreating , but often turning back
0	then spread out purple covers on these well-fashioned chairs
0	then nestor , the geranian horseman , cried out :
0	what sea route brought you here ?
0	when nausicaa had spoken , they heard her words
0	my lady , a messenger has come to me from zeus , instructing me to ransom our dear son
0	you trojans , lycians , and dardanians—soldiers who fight in the killing zone—my friends , be men
0	they were pleased with what he would said
0	perse , child of oceanus , was their mother
0	as its power increases , the subjective fades into complete forgetfulness of self
0	odius and epistrophus led the halizoni from distant alybe , where men mine silver
0	huge god hephaestus got up from the anvil blockwith laboured breathing
0	if that omenwas sent to trojans keen to cross the ditch , a high-flying eagle on our army 's leftholding in its talons a blood-red snake , still living , which it let drop before it reachedits nest , thus failing in its purpose , to bring that snake back for its offspring , then , like that bird , if we , with our great strength , breach the gates and the achaean wall , and if achaeans then retreat , we will come backfrom the ships by this same route in disarray , leaving behind many trojans slaughteredby achaean bronze , as they defend their ships
0	of the danaans , for men praise the most
0	diomedes , skilled at war cries , rejoiced
0	and on it wove a delicate wide fabric
0	then he left the soldiers there to carry on their strife , their wretched endless war
0	he carried in his spear and set it in its place , against a looming pillar
0	what must it have been like with his unapologetic successors ?
0	in book of the odyssey , when athena visits telemachus in ithaca (
0	he can make even a brave man fearful , rob him of his victory with ease
0	that you should leave my home for your fast ship as if you were departing from a man
0	near the end of his life , euripides himself propounded as emphatically as possible the question about the value and meaning of this tendency in a myth to his contemporaries
0	they all shouted with him , then drove the horses
0	so now i meet my fate
0	just as a storm wind scatters dry straw in a heap , blowing pieces here and there in all directions—
0	their skin 's not made of stone or iron
0	to see the day when i return
0	patroclus is dead , but whoever pulls himto horse-taming trojans here and makes ajax move away—i will give him half the spoils ,
0	my child , what a speech has slipped the barrier of your teeth !
0	then she inserted ambrosia and red nectar into patroclus , through his nostrils , so his flesh would stay uncorrupted
0	we lay there , hearts consumed with sorrow
0	my spirit 's breath grows faint—the river wind
0	from which he then emerged at last victorious ,
0	saying a quick word to odysseus , who was close by :
0	but if i go back home , my fame will die , though my life will lasta long time—death will not end it quickly
0	on its right shoulder
0	now no consolation has any effect
0	these men competed in the foot race on a course
0	those threats he would once made against godlike odysseus
0	but even then zeus had not decided
0	across the wine-dark sea and then arrive
0	achilles jumped up in amazement , clapped his hands , and then spoke out in sorrow :
0	the others will all swear an oath of friendship , a binding one—we will live in fertile troy , they in argos , where horses breed , and in achaea , land of lovely women
0	i hope i do not get killed or in my palace
0	just as an angler on a jutting rock
0	hector , loved by zeus , went in the house , holding his spear , sixteen feet long , bronze point glittering in front of him , a gold band running round it
0	then ajax gave a nod to phoenix
0	now 's the time for you to fight on bravely
0	with savage blows he beat up his own body ,
0	will no longer be postponed
0	zeus makes even brave men run away , stealing their victory with ease , or in person rouses men to fight
0	somehow it must please cronos ' mighty sonthat achaeans perish now without a name , far from argos
0	and laid them out underneath the portico ,
0	that 's what i said
0	but i will be with my horsemen , advising them ,
0	my spear , for odysseus , sacker of cities , also set me on his knees many times
0	all of them are trying to court my mother
0	then i called my comrades , ordering them
0	who 's been devouring the crop
0	for he is much more powerful than us
0	he 's mortal—his fate doomed him long ago
0	where their splendid weapons lay
0	dressed his body in these clothes at home ,
0	zeus thundered and then hurled a lightning flash down on our ship , which shook from stem to stern and filled with sulphurous smoke , as zeus ' bolt
0	close to the shore , a rock that looks just like
0	by doing this , is not archilochus ( the first artist called subjective ) essentially a non-artist ?
0	there 's no snow or heavy storms or even rain , and oceanus sends a steady breeze ,
0	glancing at his neighbour , one of them would say :
0	of course , when reasoning can not succeed in this endeavour , myth must finally serve , something which i have just noted as the necessary consequence , indeed , even the purpose of , science
0	there was a high front courtyard made of stones
0	until the gods show you a splendid bride
0	cloud-gatherer zeus then gave poseidon this reply :
0	his reckless people and was killed himself
0	saying this , hector gave heart and spirit to each man
0	hector 's fatal day sank , moving down to hades
0	carried me ahead and left me on your shore
0	that 's what he wanted , i suppose
0	and telemachus can cater to him—
0	onetor 's son , as he gripped the steering oar
0	but the gods can not protect a man from death—
0	i killed a dear son of idomeneus ,
0	my father will give lots of it to you—an immense ransom—if he once finds out i am at achaean ships and still alive
0	there they scattered , each man going to his own ship
0	then asius , son of hyrtacus , groaned in vexation , struck his thigh , and cried out :
0	it 's hard to compete with children of the mighty son of cronos , even thoughyou are descended from some river
0	menoetius ' brave son gave it to his companions to carry to the hollow ships
0	taking aim , bold antilochus speared him in the stomach
0	he recommended that we consider the chorus to some extent as a sample embodiment of the crowd of onlookers , as the ideal spectator
0	with strength that never tires , and in a field
0	but if any man ,
0	or do they welcome strangers ?
0	but she wo not have power
0	this book offers an answer to that question : a knowledgeable person speaks there , the initiate and disciple of his own god
0	and the day of his return
0	to come out of the cave ?
0	son of mermerus , from ephyre
0	curved ships had carried her from there some years ago , when she would been chosen as a prize for alcinous ,
0	your son , called me from the room
0	zeus and helios were angry with him—
0	while in the middle of the wine-dark sea ,
0	eager servants carried off their weapons and without delay
0	son of tydeus , wheel your sure-footed horses round
0	by what route did they bring you to ithaca ?
0	aeneas , trojancounselor , now you must defend your brother-in-law , if you feel any grief
0	telemachus , your wit and understanding
0	taking that as athena 's gift , she walked away
0	later on these animals
0	he quickly seized two men and wolfed them down
0	a powerful longing to talk face to face
0	roused from sleep , he saw that where the horses stood was empty , the fearful carnage with men gasping in their death throes
0	he will forget that pain which now weighs down his spirit
0	that resourceful man , then answered him and said :
0	enjoying themselves at his expense
0	someone else might challenge me or not
0	a noble gift—for there is nothing better
0	i do remember all these things you say ,
0	among them came the two moliones , fully armed , still young , not knowing much of serious warfare
0	i went down to our swift ship by the shore
0	the brightest clarity of the image did not suffice us , for this seemed to wish just as much to reveal something as to conceal something
0	on top , his pointed headsprouted thin , scraggly tufts of hair
0	murderous ares went in among the trojan ranks , inspiring the troops
0	their own possessions lie untouched at home ,
0	with twisted willow shoots , part of the mat
0	is it all covered in disgusting cobwebs ?
0	mighty hector 's lethal wave engulfs us
0	had robbed them of their chance to get back home
0	then wise penelope replied and said :
0	this is what 's set for them
0	she had lain with him on the slopes of ida
0	with this talent , with all the clarity and agility of his critical thinking , euripides sat in the theatre and struggled to recognize the masterpieces of his great predecessors , as with a painting darkened by age , feature by feature , line by line
0	always waiting here in hope day after day
0	send out a call
0	they kept moving back , once they realized ares was with the trojans
0	bodies kept rolling underneath his axle ,
0	to see your father 's and mother 's lofty home and them , as well ?
0	hector 's got up again , evading death
0	you can take whichever one you choose back home as your wife to peleus ' house and pay no bridal gift
0	as a result of all this , we can look upon the world of appearance , or nature , and music as two different expressions of the same thing , which itself is thus the only analogy mediating between the two of them
0	called out to eurycleia , his dear nurse :
0	it was to such a concord of nature and the ideal , to an idyllic reality , that the cultured renaissance man let himself be led back by his operatic imitation of greek tragedy
0	and that 's especially true of ithaca
0	the old man , afraid , obeyed his words , walked off in silence , along the shore by the tumbling , crashing surf
0	patroclus threw the offeringsinto the fire
0	for twenty days the gods detained me there
0	lady , no human living on boundless earth
0	icarius ' daughter , is a virtuous woman ,
0	all of you picked men of the same age ,
0	they do not extend a friendly welcome
0	for if zeus , the olympian , does not fulfill them now , later on he will
0	there 's nothing here—no plant , fig tree , vine ,
0	were sitting there—by far the best of all the suitors
0	when you have offered
0	with her hands she rubbed her cheeks and said :
0	of caring for a household to which zeus
0	son of atreus—and along with them ,
0	they dragged these back , hoping to undermine the wall
0	cloud-gatherer zeus , smiling at athena , said :
0	must pay a fine for his adultery
0	and the troubles they went through , you would grow tired and sail back home well before i would finished
0	such a belief is possible only in an age which seeks to believe that rousseau 's emile is an artist and imagines it has found in homer an artist like emile raised in the bosom of nature
0	right to his face :
0	after all , it 's his home which he came to
0	i have now come to your knee , to see if you
0	even the state knows no more powerful unwritten laws than the mythical foundation that guarantees its connection with religion and its growth from mythical notions
0	telemachus wanted to discuss his absent father
0	all had a hearty laugh at his expense , relaxing
0	not even a wheeling hawk ,
0	go , swift iris , and tell hector this—as long as he sees agamemnon , that shepherd of his people , rampaging at the front , mowing down rows of men , he must restrain himself , tell other troops to fight the enemy in the killing zone
0	next came the two ajaxes , men clothed in an impetuous ferocity
0	hector , my child , respect and pity me
0	a sad end for telemachus right here
0	quite the reverse , he was moving out to combat , to man-ennobling war
0	we sailed on further , my crewmen 's spirits
0	that checked his fighting fury
0	as the swineherd eumaeus came inside the house ,
0	a man who could find out these things , return to us unharmed , would be famousamong all men living under heaven , and get rich gifts , as well
0	consequently , music , when considered as an expression of the world , is universal to the highest degree , something which even has a relationship with the universality of ideas , rather like the way these are related to particular things
0	men prayed to lord zeus , son of cronos
0	the struggle , torment , and destruction of appearances we now consider necessary , on account of the excess of countless forms of existence forcefully thrusting themselves into life , and of the exuberant fecundity of the world 's will
0	she spoke out uttering words of sorrow :
0	seeing him , mighty agamemnon was elated
0	and leaders , too , were brushing tears aside , and each man 's legs were trembling—even then my eyes never saw his fair skin grow pale
0	life left the beast
0	her words had wings :
0	the age when youthful charm is at its height
0	godlike achilles raised his long spear , prepared to strike
0	i would have given him an argive city
0	the wound rouses the beast 's strength
0	they will honour him and give him gifts , as if he were a god
0	men fought in various groups from one ship to the next
0	at once they reached the gods ' home , steep olympus
0	prince telemachus , what do you need that 's brought you all this way on the sea 's broad back to lovely sparta ?
0	as one who 's been enraged at many people ,
0	someone might come out from the hall , see us ,
0	spoke to the animal :
0	now , we see here a grotesque defect in mythical consciousness , so that socrates can be considered specifically a non-mystic man in whom the logical character has become too massive through excessive use , just like instinctive wisdom in the mystic
0	and the citizens from the day they meet their doom—
0	in the boxing match
0	below chios and past stormy mimas
0	the first to speak was eurymachus , son of polybus :
0	back and forth before her loom—she was weaving
0	with words like this , they came up close and wounded hector
0	will that wide net of art , whether in the name of religion or of science , fly over existence always more tightly and delicately , or is it determined that it will be ripped to shreds by the restless barbaric impulses and hurly-burly which we now call the present
0	you never show good news
0	my child , this warfare is not your business
0	you yourself obviously understand
0	this is your guest gift—something to pay back
0	on top of ossa
0	he set it down , and with it a shield and helmet
0	i will tell you one i think is suitable
0	he wo not remove this wretched plague from the danaans , until we hand back bright-eyed chryseis , give her to her beloved father , freely , without ransom , and offer holy sacrifice at chryse
0	in a fit of anger , paris shot off a bronze-tipped arrow
0	it would be far better if he did
0	would have perished , something not ordained by fate , if bright-eyed athena had not given him advice
0	their herders are divine ,
0	both lord odysseus and myself were present
0	with a murderous peril right beside us
0	surely you are quite at liberty to plananything you wish
0	for everything is only a huge sublime chorus of dancing and singing satyrs or of those people who permit themselves to be represented by these satyrs
0	by a tall pillar , looking at the ground , waiting
0	the fir beams and high supporting pillars
0	but in a foreign land away from those
0	but we have no horses here , no chariot for me to chase him in
0	the face of her own son or speak to him
0	but if i came
0	they threw the bulls ' tongues on the fire and , standing up , poured out their offerings
0	through this impoverishment the phenomenon itself is even lowered in our feelings , so that now , for example , a battle imitated in this kind of music plays itself feebly out in marches , trumpet calls , and so forth , and our imagination is held back precisely by these superficialities
0	on that shield hephaestus next set a soft and fallow field , fertile spacious farmland , which had been ploughed three times
0	you never want to tell me openly what you intend
0	in the same way , for the man who surrenders himself entirely to the experience of a symphony it appears as if he saw all the possible events of life and the world drawn over into himself
0	who will escape complete destruction
0	my home 's being eaten up ,
0	they quickly left the flowing river , moving briskly forward at a rapid pace
0	in that chest of yours your mind holds out against my spell
0	then he led his troops away
0	wise penelope then answered her :
0	and thus the onlooker may well stand in real consternation in front of this fantastic excess of life , to ask himself with what magical drink in their bodies these high-spirited men could have enjoyed life so that wherever they look , helen laughs back at them , that ideal image of their own existence , hovering in sweet sensuousness
0	behind folly , who , because she 's strong and quick , runs far in front of them , appearing all over the world , bringing harm to men
0	as i hear you talk—these suitors think up
0	he used to set inside his hall , in a line ,
0	my proud spirit never gave me any sense
0	he hit achilles on the shin , below the knee
0	three hundred and sixty boars were there—four dogs , fierce as wild animals , always lay beside them
0	lady , what you say is true
0	powerful hephaestus then untied the netting
0	hoped we would meet again as host and guest ,
0	when i kill other women in my home
0	already in his native land , sitting still
0	took the bright reins and whip and lashed the mules ahead
0	crooked-minded cronos ' son made it light for him
0	across the great sea straight to euboea—
0	once lord odysseuscame here with war-loving menelaus , as an ambassador in your affairs
0	i will tell you what the heart in my chest says
0	what do i care about assisting in this war ?
0	but for all these things , he 's not been able to check the power of man-killing hector
0	he leapt into his chariot once more , drove back into the crowd , eluding his black fate
0	achilles then , in tears , withdrew from his companions , sat by the shore , staring at the wide gray seas
0	to our swift black ship , bringing a report
0	the killer of argus ,
0	the lycians , though brave , did not hold their ground
0	around these many men , you are far too brash
0	this said , eumaeus went inside the stately palace , straight into the hall to join the noble suitors
0	are you supposed to tell the female household slaves of lord odysseus
0	he begged achaeans , above all atreus ' two sons , the people 's leaders
0	he needs a sturdy ship
0	they sit high in the clouds ,
0	helenus drew back into the group of his companions , escaping death
0	and many say of him 'he 's a true man
0	he 's in the bedroom , on the carved-out bed , his beauty and his garments glistening
0	as soon as you have gone from here , the suitors
0	she scooped out in the sand some pits to hide in , and then waited there
0	i could descend beneath this hateful earth
0	most beautiful by far of all the streams
0	and it 's skill , too , that makes one charioteergo faster than another
0	but , my friends , you can repair all this—
0	suitors of the splendid queen , listen to me ,
0	the beaten man gets this two-handled cup
0	thus rescuing all achaeans
0	even before the haughty suitors come
0	and , carrying it across my back , returned
0	but that trouble-making stomach of mine
0	of female servants in the palace
0	i will give him seven populous cities , cardamyle , enope , grassy hire , holy pherae , fertile antheia , lovely aepea , and vine-rich pedasus , all near the sea , beside sandy pylos
0	they quickly followed what i would said
0	are built in a style utterly unlike
0	we stood there astounded at what we would seen— a horror desecrating the gods ' sacrifice
0	for we will not capture troy with its broad streets
0	with many more as well
0	but you should know i had no wish to fight
0	but melanthius the goatherd answered him and said :
0	in their hollow ships
0	with passion and had sex with iasion
0	when i was finished ,
0	the athenian headland , phoebus apollo
0	describe for me how you ran into him
0	held two flaming torches
0	now the spirits of the storm have snatched him ,
0	to bring these matters to an end
0	for twelve mares he would lost and sturdy mules , as well , still on the teat
0	odysseus spoke , and dolius sat down again
0	in their theatre , given the way the spectators ' space was built up in terraces , raised up in concentric rings , it was possible for everyone quite literally to look out over the collective cultural world around him and with a complete perspective to imagine himself a member of the chorus
0	you will be beaten with a torch and leave that way
0	raise a mound for me by the gray sea shore , memorial to an unfortunate man ,
0	and met his fate
0	struck the gray sea with their oar blades
0	he reached gargaros , site of his grove and temple , fragrant with sacrifice
0	but then odysseus struck the boar , hitting it
0	all right , stranger , i will speak candidly
0	then he leapt in among the ranks , calling each man :
0	their hands reached out to take the tasty food
0	when the dear son of odysseus comes ,
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	he carries a huge shieldaround his shoulders
0	shedding plenty of hot tears , and cut their hair
0	who sail around , risking their own lives ,
0	two are married , but three are now young men
0	lord odysseus never took it
0	addressing him right to his face :
0	odysseus and penelope approached with joy
0	then antinous , eupeithes ’ son , gave him this reply :
0	you need not worry about my mother
0	as nestor sat drinking wine , listening to the noise of war , he said to asclepius ' son :
0	he looks at them precisely and with pleasure , for from these pictures he fashions his interpretation of life ; from these events he rehearses his life
0	he truly was a gentle father to me
0	but his sword cut down the son of telephus , brave eurypylus
0	where waves come crashing with a roar on them
0	the major criticism which plato made about the old art—that it was the imitation of an illusion and thus belonged to a lower level than the empirical world—must above all not be directed against his new work of art
0	and provide him clothing
0	art alone can turn those thoughts of disgust at the horror or absurdity of existence into imaginary constructs , which permit living to continue
0	and hephaestus have taught all sorts of crafts ,
0	the heavy bronze-pointed arrow flew awry
0	he sat down beside the son of cronos , exulting in his glory
0	considered how he might make such a promise
0	will separate without some blood being spilled
0	but there are other kings of the achaeans ,
0	let 's withdraw , avoiding zeus ' anger
0	for from all people living on the earth
0	the chorus of oceanids really believes that they see the titan prometheus in front of them and consider themselves every bit as real as the god of the scene
0	one held a freshly laundered cloak and tunic
0	more so than others
0	clytaemnestra organized a trap for you ,
0	there was a third leader , god-like euryalus , mecisteus ' son , son of lord talaus
0	if these last sentences have perhaps managed to give only a preliminary expression to these difficult ideas and are immediately intelligible only to few , i nevertheless may not desist at this point from trying to stimulate my friends to further efforts and must ask them to use a single example of our common experience in order to prepare themselves for a general insight
0	i told my crew
0	a good and loyal man , a son-in-law ,
0	and i am the first born
0	then addressed the son of nestor :
0	on my way back there ,
0	as he said this , he led the long-suffering stranger towards the house
0	for already i have hit two of their best men , tydeus ' son and the son of atreus
0	which , i think , will happen—even though
0	remembering our qualities , the skills
0	if i try to land ,
0	is now besotted , loaded down with wine
0	thus , as patroclus , menoetius ' fine son , looked after wounded eurypylus in his hut , trojans and achaeans kept fighting on in clusters
0	with sedge , broad-eared white barley , wheat , and rye
0	recall your warlike poweramong these hollow ships
0	things would have been much better
0	it was like a tower made of bronze , with seven layers , each one of ox-hide , a weapon made by tychius , the best of leather workers , who lived in hyle
0	i wo not deny you or get in your way
0	my heart was always fearful , just in case
0	i wishsome comrade would report back quickly to peleus ' son , for i do not think he 's learnedthe dreadful news of his dear comrade 's death
0	artemis herself had taught him how to shootevery animal raised in the mountain forests
0	his weapon wounded her slim wrist , piercing the skinabove her hand , right through her godlike robe , a garment the graces had made for her themselves
0	if for your sake odysseus ever burned
0	people living in these places own a lot , many sheep and cattle
0	bronze-armed achaeans talked together , using words like these :
0	neither side had any thought of ruinous flight
0	as he looked at him he seemed like the immortals
0	then shrewd odysseus answered him and said :
0	like foreign strangers , assuming many shapes
0	you missed , godlike achilles
0	but you men , you soldiers , cowardly comrades , disgraceful people ,
0	divinely born son of laertes , resourceful odysseus—try lifting me , or i will try lifting you
0	i wo not approachwithin sight of achilles
0	so if beggars have their gods and furies ,
0	around the shabby beggars
0	for that reason , achilles , you should give zeus ' daughters your respect
0	then she called out to the loyal swineherd , saying :
0	must like to watch that hateful bunch of suitors
0	before nestor could finish , the two men arrived
0	when they lost you , such a tower of strength
0	the shade of atreus ' son then answered him :
0	all-conquering sleep then overpowered him
0	you are not following zeus ' plans
0	or he may escape , if the son of cronos
0	where they were born and bred
0	my heart will never prompt me to do that , for i have learned always to be brave , to fight alongside trojans at the front , striving to win fame for father and myself
0	they surpass all women for their beauty
0	let me board your ship—i am a fugitive ,
0	how my heart pictures him
0	pulled it from the fire
0	art saves him , and through art life saves him
0	the second city was surrounded by two armies , soldiers with glittering weapons
0	christianity was from the start essentially and thoroughly disgust and weariness with life , which only dressed itself up , only hid itself in , only decorated itself with the belief in an other or better life
0	or had met his fate
0	icarius , in his home , where he himself
0	in an almost alarming manner the culture man was for a long time found only in the form of the scholar : even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from scholarly imitations , and in the main effect , that of rhyme , we still recognize the origin of our poetic form from artificial experiments with a nonindigenous , really scholarly language
0	the god 's gift had protected him
0	priam 's city of broad streets was taken
0	by then i will have completed all our gifts
0	make sure they lash you there with still more rope
0	then he untied the horses from their harnesses
0	to see if he would keep up his kindly welcome
0	even though your home is far away
0	get them here fast , while still i have arrows
0	no one could explain to him why his reflections about and objections to the great masters might be correct
0	both together , so lord odysseus himself
0	holy persephone might send at me
0	even though a strong net tied you down ?
0	to get back home
0	in the piles of dung left there by mules and cattle , heaped up before the doors until odysseus ' servants took it as manure for some large field
0	the god who kept guard over ismarus ,
0	for some time telemachus
0	from the plain , the wind carried the sweet-smelling smoke right up to heaven
0	in his heart nestor 's son
0	as he had ordered
0	telemachus then spoke to them with royal authority :
0	worms are not eating him ,
0	do not let your hearts fear any ambush , some crafty achaean trick
0	my trusty comrades summoned me and said :
0	the loyal swineherd joined the crowd of suitors
0	achaea 's sons stood up and welcomed them with toastsin golden cups , one after another , asking questions
0	worthless men could not father sons like you
0	or is he here pursuing his own business ?
0	elpenor , how did you come to this place ,
0	he spoke to the immortals , full of rage :
0	now , as for yourself ,
0	brother , you are arming yourself
0	the leader of the cretans , furious with ajax , then replied :
0	i have no fight with them
0	who court me in my halls—the one who offers
0	achilles ' words at once stirred into action a strong , brave man , well skilled in boxing—epeius , son of panopeus
0	she said this , then left for the fine palace
0	or i to him , but in my chest and heart
0	she said to us :
0	devising perils for my enemies ,
0	for anyone who asked him : the name irus is probably a masculine version of iris , the name of the goddess who carries messages for the gods
0	escorting the large trunk
0	now they would have mourned till sunset , but achilles soon got up and said to agamemnon :
0	the hateful marriage , but can not decide
0	nausicaa went to stand close by her father
0	the suitors went inside godlike odysseus ' home
0	for i will give you all the help you need
0	beside him in the chariot , grabbed the reins ,
0	hector did not notice ajax , for he was fighting on the far left of the battle , by scamander 's banks , where the slaughter was most fierce
0	who knows true devotion and has suffered
0	to every noble she approached she spoke these words :
0	as medon spoke , penelope felt her heart and knees give way where she was standing
0	in recompense for this , you angry gods
0	i was the only one
0	city of wide streets
0	honoured wife of odysseus , laertes ' son ,
0	a sceptre in his hand
0	he charged at acamas , who did not stay there to confront the charge of noble peneleus , so he then struck ilioneus , son of phorbas , who owned many flocks , a man whom hermes loved above all trojans , and he would made him wealthy
0	on top he threw a large cloak
0	richly wrapped in fat , grant this prayer for me—
0	the whole plain by now was filled with men and horses , all in gleaming bronze
0	if apollo also stands among them , as a single god next to the others and without any claim to the pre-eminent position , we should not on that account let ourselves be deceived
0	protect yourselfagainst your enemy inside these walls
0	is far the dearest of all men to me
0	but before he said a word , long-robed helen spoke and said these words :
0	by weeping for your husband any more
0	troops assembled on the run
0	and my son is worrying about those men
0	groping with his hands he picked up the stone ,
0	as for me , when he 's become a full-grown man
0	but do not blame mefor golden aphrodite 's lovely gifts
0	we should save medon , too ,
0	sometimes to one man and , at other times ,
0	one man could block the way for everyone ,
0	sometimes her eyes gazed at him full in the face , but other times she failed to recognize him ,
0	we who live in troy are men with courage , and there are lots of us
0	graze wandering herds of goats , eleven in all ,
0	then resourceful odysseus answered eumaeus with these words :
0	then forged a net no one could break or loosen ,
0	the noise from both sides went up into bright zeus ' sky
0	there is an old saying to the effect that king midas for a long time hunted the wise silenus , the companion of dionysus , in the forests , without catching him
0	east wind clashed with south wind , while west wind , raging in a storm , smashed into north wind , born in the upper sky ,
0	and speak the truth—i can see there the shade of my dead mother , sitting near the blood , in silence
0	they may breed worms in him , defile his corpse , now that the life in him is gone
0	enjoying themselves—their hearts are cheerful
0	this said , hector gave ajax a silver-studded sword , along with a scabbard and a well-cut sword belt
0	when they are worn out with work and lack of sleep
0	in my own country
0	for cronos ' sonhas made the rest of the danaans flee
0	the keen arrow bounded off
0	now death and fate have overtaken you
0	but i will go
0	achilles stood by the stern of his broad-beamed ship , watching the harsh work of battle , the pitiful retreat
0	if we assume that this desire for the beautiful and the good might be quite true—and pericles , or , rather , thucydides , in the great funeral oration gives us to understand that it is—where must that contradictory desire stem from , which appears earlier than the desire for beauty , namely , the desire for the ugly or the good strong willing of the ancient hellenes for pessimism , for tragic myth , for pictures of everything fearful , angry , enigmatic , destructive , and fateful as the basis of existence ?
0	swooping down on everyone , destruction in their eyes
0	would have been eager to rush home to see
0	to poseidon , dark-haired shaker of the earth
0	so these men kept conversing with each other
0	old friend , where does this stranger come from ?
0	a two-handled jar of gold
0	a herald led the guests away
0	resourceful odysseus , laertes ' son
0	start carrying those corpses outside now ,
0	an island far away , where they could tend
0	act with graciousness to us
0	in astonishment , achilles got up off his chair and stood up quickly , still holding the lyre
0	so the achaeans stripped sarpedon , pulling the gleaming bronze from off his shoulders
0	for the two of us , or should i think about
0	to make a meal of him
0	the metaphysical joy in the tragic is a translation of the instinctive unconscious dionysian wisdom into the language of the image
0	rubbed them down with oil , and wrapped around them woolen cloaks and tunics , they came out from the bath and sat down on the chairs
0	my child , what words escaped the barrier of your teeth !
0	as he ran off in front of him
0	he left an only daughter , arete
0	there with my bronze-tipped spear i struck him
0	it 's bad when someone does not want to leave
0	she promised to bring me splendid armourfrom hephaestus
0	son of the wise anchialus , and king
0	with ceaseless grief which i can not forget
0	i called to him—my words
0	with these words , hephaestus left her there , going to start his bellows
0	agamemnon struck him with his bronze-tipped spear shaft below his embossed shield , as he was pulling iphidamas out from the crowd
0	do not stand out there to face him
0	i am afraid that he 's in trouble
0	so tell me the truth—this present visit ,
0	sleep was overjoyed and said :
0	for i must followthe dictates of a cruel old age these days , though as a warrior i once excelled
0	schiller has illuminated his own writing process with a psychological observation , inexplicable to him , which nevertheless does not appear dubious
0	hera , do not hope to understand my every plan
0	those others over there
0	from slaughter , not until the suitors pay
0	for the voyage back to his dear native land ,
0	as a friend , someone worthy of their pity
0	you are a man who runs away
0	he hit acamas , son of eussorus , a strong brave soldier , best of the thracians
0	but you must go to athena ’ s temple , goddess of battle spoils , with burnt offerings
0	he went in at once and sat among the suitors ,
0	the illustrious son of wise polybus ,
0	strictly charged me to avoid this island ,
0	then later i can welcome you as guests ,
0	once hector spoke , he balanced his long-shadowed spear and hurled it
0	they placed the urn under soft linen in a hut
0	you shameless bitch , you dare stand against me ?
0	i have not hit him
0	but when he left the crowd of men and horses , he went eagerly along the path
0	to the lovely girl hermione , as beautiful
0	delighting us in any way his mind
0	you are so polite , intelligent , and cautious
0	he went off , leaving the courtyard and the hall , back to his pigs
0	gazing up to heaven , they uttered words like these :
0	imagine for a moment the following scenario : if the incalculable sum of all the energy which has been used in pursuit of this world project is spent not in the service of knowledge but on the practical ( ie , egotistical ) aims of individuals and peoples , then in all probability the instinctive delight in living would be so weakened in universal wars of destruction and continuing migrations of people that , with suicide being a common occurrence , the individual , perhaps out of a sense of duty , would have to see death as a final rest and , like the inhabitants of the fiji islands , the son would strangle his parents , the friend would strangle his friend
0	we rather maintain that the entire opposition , which even schopenhauer uses as a measurement of value to classify art , that opposition of the subjective and the objective , has generally no place in aesthetics , since the subject , the willing individual demanding his own egotistical purposes , can only be thought of as an enemy of art not as its origin
0	so come , tell me , famous odysseus , great glory of achaeans , does he wishto protect our ships from all-destroying fire , or does he refuse , his mighty spiritstill gripped with anger
0	eurylochus came back immediately
0	in order to express that appearance in images , the lyric poet needs all the excitement of passion , from the whispers of affection right to the ravings of lunacy
0	patroclus slept opposite achilles
0	then i was young
0	idaios then returned , going back to sacred ilion
0	in accordance with these general assumptions and comparisons , let us now approach the greeks , in order to recognize to what degree and to what heights the natural artistic drives had developed in them and how we are in a position to understand more deeply and assess the relationship of the greek artist to his primordial images or , to use aristotle 's expression , his imitation of nature
0	she agreed to go
0	they charged out in a frenzy through the house ,
0	she was in a room inside their lofty home , weaving purple fabric for a double cloak , embroidering flowers on it
0	heaven echoed with the din
0	in fact , take away the lives and spirits
0	odysseus grabbed irus by the foot and dragged him
0	aphrodite , zeus 's daughter , scorns me
0	zeus gave you sceptre and laws to rule them
0	back to our swift ship and cross the water
0	before the day she married one in public
0	vultures will gnaw awaytheir tender flesh , while we lead off their wives
0	far from my own land , abandoning my child ,
0	the spirit left its bones
0	are you waitinguntil they fight by the well-built city gates ?
0	withdrawing some distance from them , he sat apart , exultant , glorious
0	o father zeus , athena , and apollo— if i only had ten such counselorsamong achaeans , king priam 's citywould soon fall , be taken , sacked at our hands
0	eurypylus , i ca not staywith you any longer here , though you need help
0	then the sun set , and darkness covered all the roads
0	lay waiting for me—i at once removed
0	patroclus pulled his spear back , dragging thestor out across the chariot rail
0	all the wives who now control their homes
0	ajax , noble son of telamon , your people 's leader , everything you say matches what i feel
0	what curious consideration of the spectator led him to go against the spectator ?
0	zeus ' daughter aphrodite then took aresand led him off by hand , as he kept groaning— he found it difficult to get his spirit back
0	tell her she must marry whichever man
0	i built my bedroom round this olive bush ,
0	then the women began their wailing , led by white-armed andromache , who held in her arms the head of man-killing hector
0	famous spearman odysseus came up and made a stand before him
0	it was in accordance with the laically unmusical crudeness of these views that the combination of music , image , and words was effected in the beginnings of the opera
0	when coön noticed this , an eminent man , antenor 's eldest son , his eyes darkened with grief for his fallen brother
0	so she stood there facing up to him
0	his words had wings :
0	holding off the suitors in your house
0	something disgusting and ridiculous—
0	he came to priam 's splendid palace , with porticos of well-ground stone
0	their honour comes from zeus the counselor , who loves them
0	before this point , i was still a foolish child
0	for second place he led out a mare six years old , unbroken and with a mule foal in her womb
0	heart full of misgivings
0	the bronze-tipped arrow hit his right buttock , pushing underneath the bone , going right into the bladder
0	singing and dancing , man expresses himself as a member of a higher unity
0	telemachus spoke , and they all bit their lips , astonished that he would spoken out so boldly
0	then they raised the body off the ground , lifting it high with one great heave
0	where the steward pours the wine
0	since our godlike minstrel was first moved to sing , as we were dining , our guest has been in pain—
0	could see you , more suitors would be feasting
0	back to your well-built home and native land
0	we are here as suppliants to you , and zeus protects
0	he called out to his slaves , and they did what he ordered
0	from phylace—broad-faced beasts with spiral horns , and hard to manage
0	achilles spoke and took his seat
0	how great must dionysus be among you if the god of delos considers such magic necessary to heal your dithyrambic madness !
0	but wise penelope , icarius ' daughter ,
0	he 's brought to me a fitting ransom
0	you were telling lies to make me fear you , so i might forget my strength and courage
0	until i would asked teiresias my questions
0	now i beg you ,
0	stranger , if you wished to sit beside me in these halls
0	i will tell you where all this is going to lead— that arrogance will soon cost him his life
0	what about your parents ?
0	this new soul should have sung , not spoken !
0	even the noblest moral deeds , the sympathetic emotions , self-sacrifice , heroism and that calmness in the soul ( so difficult to attain ) , which the apollonian greeks called sophrosyne—all these were derived by socrates and his like-minded descendants right up to the present from the dialectic of knowledge and therefore described as teachable
0	theoclymenus called him aside ,
0	do not let the pain exhaust you
0	so , as my guest , i can offer you a gift , something you will like
0	this likeness you have just noticed , my dear wife ,
0	when the blameless prophet had drunk dark blood , he said these words to me :
0	you hold them back with your commands , each one working from his own position
0	i have no wish to see with my own eyes my dear son fight war-loving menelaus
0	a gift from dionysus , something made
0	ares suffered , too , when mighty otusand ephialtes , children of aloëus , tied him up in powerful manacles , then kept him prisoner in a brass jarfor thirteen months
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared , males in the flock trotted off to pasture ,
0	and carry out as many funeral rites
0	how i wish odysseus from way back then
0	as he said this , a massive wave charged at him with tremendous force , swirled round the raft , then from high above crashed down
0	come on , we ca not fight argives from a distance
0	we used to spend
0	homer , the ancient self-absorbed dreamer , the archetype of the naïve apollonian artist , now stares astonished at the passionate head of wild archilochus , the fighting servant of the muses , battered by existence
0	she saw hector as he was being dragged past before the city , with swift horses pulling him ruthlessly away to the achaeans ' hollow ships
0	if that 's true , if you are indeed my son odysseus
0	his limbs dripped sweat , and dust rose from his head
0	but happiness like that the gods deny me ,
0	whatever might have been be the basis for this dubious book , it must have been a question of the utmost importance and charm , as well as a deeply personal one
0	so achaeans got welcome relief in their flight from godlike hector
0	because we ca not endure what 's happening
0	epeius made with guidance from athena
0	if a god does overpower these lordly suitors
0	brings double benefits—it gives him help
0	but on that voyage back
0	wolves and lambsdo not share a common heart—they always sense
0	a long time simply testing every man ,
0	to open up or close our well-built trap ,
0	he threw off his purple cloak
0	give me some rag to throw around myself ,
0	when , surrounded by his enemies ,
0	his flocks bear young
0	but since those days ,
0	laertes then answered him and said :
0	what our country 's called—the phaeacians
0	he 's hard by the land of the phaeacians ,
0	friends , if we are all fated to be killed togetherby this man , let no one leave the battle
0	and came to find news about my father
0	compensation on his own , in an amount
0	a beautiful gold jug and poured some water out
0	slash them with long swords , until the life is gone
0	and give me the truth
0	and there were plenty—had fallen in blood and dust , like fish which , in the meshes of a net , fishermen
0	in some thick bushes and so rid myself
0	i will send him off
0	just as when zeus , husband of fair-haired hera , flashes lightning to announce a massive rain storm , an immense downpour of hail or snow , when fields are sprinkled white , or to foretell some bitter warfare , the gaping jaws of battle—in just that way then the groans reverberated in agamemnon 's chest , deep in his heart , making his whole body tremble
0	but when i would had enough of shedding tears
0	for a long time now , they have stayed apart from one another , not sharing love there in the marriage bed , since anger fills their hearts
0	chest straps on our protective body shieldswill be soaked through with sweat
0	will keep penned up here inside the hall ,
0	we stayed inside the cave and waited there ,
0	look beside you— there 's a great stream there , but he ca not help you
0	mighty earthshaker poseidon , very angry , answered hera :
0	hand your comrade the cup of honey wine ,
0	if you are one of the gods who hold wide heaven ,
0	she gave my helpless husband her fine care
0	to wise penelope that you are safe
0	menelaus , son of atreus , zeus-fostered leader of your people ,
0	; whereas , music , by contrast , gives the heart of the thing , the innermost core , which comes before all particular shapes
0	next , the old man burned the pieces on split wood and poured gleaming wine on them
0	he placed his bellows far from the fire and collected all his work tools , then stored them in a silver chest
0	one 's pandarus , the skillful archer , who boasts he 's lycaon 's son
0	so you should give a bigger piece of bread
0	for myth must be vividly felt as a single instance of universality and truth staring into the infinite
0	helmets and bossed shields rang out as they were hit with rocks the size of millstones
0	then he hit him with his massive sword , taking his life
0	then cebriones noticed trojans were being driven back
0	agamemnon spoke , sending his brother off with detailed orders
0	she stirred them onto endless lamentation
0	and govern in this land , and i myself
0	moving off toward erebus , to join
0	you claim to be a prophet with these men ,
0	idomeneus , leader of the cretans , answered meriones :
0	was the only one who promised he would try ,
0	aboard the ship with him
0	but i did not seehis face , for the horses passed me quicklyin their haste to gallop on
0	then she made her whiter than fresh-cut ivory
0	with her right she grabbed the bow , snatching it and its quiver off her shoulders
0	but where invincible talents fought against the socratic instructions , his power , together with the force of his immense personality , was always still strong enough to force poetry itself into new attitudes , unknown up until then
0	but warlike diomedes was the main commander
0	for suddenly in his heart he was afraid that , when she touched him , she might see a scar he had , and then the truth would be revealed
0	without your consent i would never board a raft ,
0	now , those allies—are they intermingledwith horse-taming trojans where they sleepor separate from them ?
0	father zeus will make one group victorious
0	blood soaked the chariot rails , thrown up in gouts from horses ' hooves and wheel rims
0	where 's your mind gone , that wisdom you once had , for which in earlier days you were well knownamong your subjects and with strangers , too ?
0	on both sides there were steep banks along its length , with many large sharp stakes driven in the upper edge , set there by achaea 's sons as a protection against their enemies
0	before you get back to your native land ,
0	with tears streaming down , penelope addressed the famous singer :
0	now we are matched by hector , just one man , who will quickly set our ships alight with fire
0	a greater worry in my heart that you ,
0	in fearful battles he killed many men
0	you do not need to suffer what comes from wandering on the restless sea
0	they were astonished telemachus had talked to them so forcefully
0	once the sun had set
0	but the blessed gods were not willingto accept it , for sacred ilion , and priam , and priam 's people , rich in sheep , did not please them
0	after moving around in many lands ,
0	with his spear , he hit thymbraeusin his left nipple , tossing him from his chariot to the ground
0	is so against all human law
0	cur that he is , he does not dare confront me face to face
0	i ran away to her , and zeus held back , though still enraged , not wishing to offend swift night
0	they sent a messenger to tell the woman
0	just as a skillful workman sets a layer of gold
0	the way i used to have , or if my travels
0	their talk is crude , and that i would avoid , in case someone
0	when he would sailed off in his ships , odysseus had made mentor steward of his household , charging them to follow what the old man ordered and telling mentor to keep all property secure
0	these men in their armour were fighting at the head of those brave phthians , standing with boeotians to defend the ships
0	have brought me other grievous troubles
0	to lead their ships to troy
0	both her eyes were full of tears , and she would lost her voice
0	sweet sleep rushed to the achaean ships , to inform poseidon , the encircler and shaker of the earth
0	if you say so , old friend
0	opposing him , hector leapt from his chariot down to the ground
0	he was dealing with his grief
0	what are you doing just standing here , like dazed fawns exhausted after runningover a large plain , now motionless , hearts drained of spirit—that 's how you stand , in a trance , not marching up to battle
0	you love constant strife—war and combat
0	the dogs and young men were chasing after them
0	then she went down into the sweet-smelling room which stored their gowns , fine embroidered work of women from sidonia , which godlike paris brought with him from sidon , when he sailed across the broad sea , on that voyage where he carried high-born helen off
0	a desperate struggle then ensued among the trojans and danaans fighting there
0	through this gulf of oblivion , the world of everyday reality and the dionysian reality separate from each other
0	and then let 's charge , go at him all together in a group ,
0	aiming his shining spear at him , idomeneus threw
0	what a mess , child of aegis-bearing zeus !
0	you threaten now to confiscate the prizei worked so hard for , gift from achaea 's sons
0	hence , with archilochus a new world of poetry begins , something which conflicts very profoundly with the homeric world
0	if i am fatedto die by the bronze-clad achaeans ' ships , that 's what i wish
0	perhaps horseman peleuswas not your father , nor thetis your mother—the gray sea delivered you , some tall cliff , for you have an unyielding heart
0	why are long-haired achaeans once againretreating to their ships , being beaten backacross the plain in terror ?
0	if he 's alive or dead
0	who understand things well
0	the dionysian , with its primordial joy experienced even in pain , is the common source of music and tragic myth
0	if we recall how the dreamer , in the middle of his illusory dream world , calls out to himself , without destroying that world , it is a dream
0	ilioneus was the only child his mother bore to phorbas
0	for when gods appear ,
0	his limbs gave way , as his spirit left him
0	he died under your powerful hands
0	beauty and wisdom beyond all women
0	odysseus did the same—he kissed their heads and hands
0	he looked around him carefully , as he moved , so no warrior 's bronze would hit his flesh
0	your request some time agotaught me my lesson , on that very day when hercules , son of almighty zeus , set sail from ilion , after he would sackedthe trojans ' city
0	and the heifer from the herd
0	diomedes ' words missed godlike , firm odysseus , who moved off to the achaeans ' hollow ships
0	to go without—no matter who it is
0	i have been stranded too long on this island and ca not discover any sign of help
0	so she locked the doors of that well-furnished hall
0	who had a lion 's heart and qualities
0	on my right hand and said :
0	agamemnon finished speaking and sat back down
0	pay attention to me so i can say
0	she fixed a gorgeous golden belt and placed a veil
0	then serve it to all people in the hall ,
0	for his mother bore him to go through trouble more than other men
0	to tell me clearly of your father 's trip ,
0	year after year—the sub-soil is so rich
0	pallas athena had a special love for him
0	but the latter , though an impetuous warrior , did not stand his ground
0	for those beasts , then i will go down to hades and shine among the dead
0	this seemed the better choice—to hit him with less force , so achaeans would not look at him too closely
0	but come now , eat my food , and drink my wine , until you have got back that spirit in your chest you had when you first left your native land of rugged ithaca
0	as if they are descended from great zeus
0	come in now , dear boy , so that my heart
0	to the sounds of celebration
0	old godlike priam then said to hermes :
0	he claimed that one day , as a splendid ship
0	and a boar that breeds with sows , then leave ,
0	is for his freight—he keeps a greedy eye
0	helios had stayed on watch and gave him a report
0	we may either die or ward off death and fate and then escape
0	and pens no longer hold them , as they run ,
0	of everything that crawls over the earth ,
0	taking on the form of enipeus
0	he met alexander , busy in his room with his fine weapons—shield and body armour—polishing his curving bow
0	as they lunged at one another in the crowd of men , their bronze chests echoed with the fearful noise
0	well , when it was the third watch of the night
0	but they did not understand why this had happened
0	then , leaning back , one of them would throw it high , towards the shadowy clouds , and then the other ,
0	which helen had been given by alcandre ,
0	he begged me many times to let him loose ,
0	where he used to rest when sweet sleep came to him
0	just give me a swift ship and twenty rowers—
0	were you not the one
0	i am not afraid of war , the din of chariots , but there 's always something more powerful , the mind of zeus , who bears the aegis
0	but far fewer of them died , for they were careful to protect each other from complete destruction in that fighting crowd
0	no man could match me , none of the epeians , my own pylians , nor any of the brave aetolians
0	hobbling up and down his vineyard hills
0	people call it batieia , but the gods know it as the tomb of agile myrine
0	then hecuba took her turn in leading their laments :
0	my son-in-law and daughter , give the boy
0	nobly born son of laertes , resourceful odysseus , so you now wish
0	glorious hector then told fiery cebriones to lash the horses on , drive them to battle
0	if these overbearing suitors kill me
0	terrified , he started running , leaving the gate
0	old man nestor shamed them
0	shedding many tears , stretching out his hands ,
0	my heart can bear all that ,
0	he said he had no appetite for food
0	in early morning , as that sacred day grew stronger , weapons hurled by both sides grimly took their toll— men kept on dying
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	son of atreus , you must maintain with forceyour previous plan to lead the argive troops directly to the harsh demands of war
0	of all living men , you are the worst—
0	their best man is leaving
0	it 's hard for one man to restrain so many
0	that just how odysseus
0	with their shameful plans , the suitors brought this on
0	so i know how many men there are
0	in a lonely place close to our curved ship ,
0	confronted with such a public , the nobler natures among the artists counted upon exciting their moral-religious emotions , and the appeal to the moral world-order intervened vicariously where some powerful artistic magic ought to enrapture the genuine listener
0	one ash spear , weighted down with bronze , fell against the wall
0	after saying this , swift-footed iris sped away
0	prudent eurycleia then answered him :
0	if i can see my goods again , my slaves ,
0	have the cattle herder drive it to me
0	ever visit you in future ?
0	all at once , joy and sorrow gripped her heart
0	this reconciliation is the most important moment in the history of greek culture
0	never has desire so filled my mind as now , not even when i first took you awayfrom lovely lacedaemon , sailing off in our sea-worthy ships , or when i lay with you in our lover 's bed on the isle of cranae
0	go to mount olympus , implore zeus , if ever you in word or deed have pleased him
0	but i will say this—and what i say will happen—i will break apart the skin and crush the bonesof the man who fights me
0	into the sturdy hall the entrance to a passage ,
0	in their black ship
0	saying this , ares struck athena 's tasseled aegis , that fearful aegis which not even zeus ' lightning can overcome
0	now he 's met his death , his fate
0	after you ’ ve been there , proceed to sparta
0	granting him for all his days continually
0	and took me with him , until we reached
0	for i am a man
0	antilochus , a prudent man , replied :
0	i am odysseus , son of laertes ,
0	each time they drank that honey-sweet red wine ,
0	therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time the primal phenomenon of the tragic can be described with some degree of success
0	had purchased her with his own wealth—at the time ,
0	he 's been away so long
0	can read men 's hearts and thoughts—they know
0	to lock their room—bolt the close-fitting doors
0	row on quickly past her ,
0	then agelaus spoke , calling all the suitors :
0	we can not begin to sense its highest value until it confronts us , as it did the greeks , as the quintessence of all prophylactic powers of healing , as the mediator that worked among the strongest and in themselves most fatal qualities of the people
0	beside stern cables of our ship
0	we came back really angry in our hearts , enraged about those promised wages he would withheld
0	counselor zeus was waiting to glimpse with his own eyes the blazefrom a burning ship , for that would be the moment he was going to push the trojans from the ships and give the glory to danaans
0	i am born from axius , the wide-streaming river , whose waters are the loveliest which flow upon this earth
0	what if i hired you for some distant farm—
0	he will remember me , as he pours libations
0	and apollo grants him glory , i will dress him
0	by the courtyard , skinning goats and singeing pigs
0	leave your home here on olympus
0	with a bright veil before her face
0	his favourite , for whom he 's undergone much sorrow ,
0	beyond the reach of breathing fire
0	there she should tryto get the trojans to break their oaths first , by harming the glorious achaeans
0	to tell each other to our heart 's content
0	zeus , whose thoughtsendure forever , is calling for you
0	as you were dying , you did not reach your hand out from the bed , or give me some final words of wisdom ,
0	a shameful death right here
0	and other things , your livelihood and mine
0	do you not seehow they are busy stripping dolops ' armour ?
0	you can prepare yourself—it wo not be long
0	the pylian horsemen waited there till dawn while squads of men on foot
0	and sets them under you , then i will tell you
0	a quick respite from his exhausting troubles
0	we went aboard at once , put up the mast ,
0	did you sail here in ?
0	turn his hands against those shameless suitors ?
0	he found her there , a huge fire blazing in her hearth—from far away
0	her appearance changed to look like dymas ' daughter—
0	while the thunderclap of the battle of worth was reverberating across europe , the meditative lover of enigmas whose lot it was to father this book sat somewhere in a corner of the alps , extremely reflective and perplexed ( thus simultaneously very distressed and carefree ) and wrote down his thoughts concerning the greeks , the kernel of that odd and difficult book to which this later preface ( or postscript ) should be dedicateda few weeks after that , he found himself under the walls of metz , still not yet free of the question mark which he had set down beside the alleged serenity of the greeks and of greek culture , until , in that month of the deepest tension , as peace was being negotiated in versailles , he finally came to peace with himself and , while slowly recovering from an illness he would brought back home with him from the field , finished composing the birth of tragedy out of the spirit of music
0	telemachus , now you have reached
0	the sharp rock struck him on the forehead , bashing in his eyebrows , breaking through the skull
0	antinous came up laughing at telemachus
0	i would ask you to consider this—you will spend
0	but if they are having trouble where they are , with fights breaking out , let mighty ajax , son of telamon , come by himself
0	i mean , ones now on earth who feed on bread
0	perhaps , as we speak , odysseus and mighty diomedes are driving sure-footed horses back from trojans
0	they looked like full-grown pigs , nine years old , standing in front of her
0	once he would filled his heart with food and drink , he left , returning to his pigs , through the courtyard and the hall full of banqueters , who were enjoying themselves with dance and song , for evening had already come
0	a mighty oath by all the gods she would tell no one
0	prothous , son of tenthredon , led the magnetes , from the region round peneus and mount pelion , where leaves are always trembling in the wind
0	of thesprotians—with many treasures
0	telemachus had gone to visit the estates
0	about my master 's painful death
0	until golden-throned sacred artemis
0	but you must rouse paris , and he should hurry , so he can catch me here in the city
0	he collapsed with a crash , and darkness fell upon his eyes
0	rest idle , not even if he 's come here
0	i was always fond of ships with oars
0	and keep nothing hidden , so he can reach
0	as for you , zeus-fostered menelaus ,
0	across the broad back of the sea
0	i was taking gold and silver back with me ,
0	it has a harbour , too , with good anchorage ,
0	the mirror in which earlier only great and bold features had been shown now displayed a painful fidelity which conscientiously reflected the unsuccessful features of nature
0	thanks to my courage—for i was no fool ,
0	but that did not push odysseus off the pathway
0	still , i will answer what you ask , the questions you have posed
0	and it will happen—if he strings the bow
0	by zeus , highest and most excellent of all gods , it 's not right that water touch my head , until i have laid patroclus on his fire , piled up a burial mound , and shaved my hair , since such grief will never reach my hearta second time , not while i still remainamong the living
0	at the best of times , he 's a proud man now you have encouraged him to be prouder still
0	in circe 's house , after i would been sleeping , i did not think of using the long ladder
0	it 's on the shouldersof hector with the shining helmet—he boasts about it
0	thus , in council you want us all to thinkyou ’ re better than the rest
0	or at least as a philologist—even today in this area almost everything is still there for philologists to discover and dig up , above all the issue that there is a problem right here and that the greeks will continue remain , as before , entirely unknown and unknowable as long as we have no answer to the question , what is the dionysian ?
0	at once he thundered down from glittering olympus , from high beyond the clouds
0	with an angry frown , wily odysseus then answered her and said :
0	daughter of great-hearted alcinous , had ordered
0	how is euripides ' work related with respect to this ideal of apollonian drama ?
0	but he did not strip his corpse—his heartfelt too much shame for that
0	a competition featuring those axes
0	a warm and gentle breeze
0	the many ships which sailed here with youfrom mycenae stand ready by the sea
0	each man glanced around , checking how he might escape his own complete destruction
0	the best of all the argives , voyaged , too ,
0	that 's what she said , and our proud hearts agreed
0	have you been hurt ?
0	came some servants carrying a chest which held
0	and i do not blame
0	gods are supposed to give us happiness
0	now my son lies in the dust , heart filled with pain
0	the stranger 's strength made him the better man
0	sent a black cloud above our hollow ship
0	what young men went with him ?
0	so i weep all the time
0	so none of you
0	then he would get up , to wander in distress , back and forth along the shore
0	stay here a while
0	this bowl achilles set out as a prize to honour his companion , a trophy for the man who in the footrace proved he was the fastest
0	i think it 's clear
0	acamas shouted this , bringing grief to argives
0	way over there among the trojans ,
0	now i will go back and tell this to achilles
0	the first one to speak was telamonian ajax :
0	and were asleep , but this one , weaker than the rest , had not yet finished
0	the day he 's taken and becomes a slave
0	and it was freezing cold
0	and put everything in some containers—
0	she may rescue him from death
0	and athena gave me strength and courage ,
0	the child odysseus had , telemachus
0	churning the water white with polished blades
0	went to her bright room upstairs and wept there
0	it can not be described ?
0	even the virtuous ones
0	did he take that black ship against your will ,
0	he charged on , eager to force the argives quickly back , to massacre large numbers of their soldiers
0	even now , if you would speak to fierce achilles , you might persuade him
0	he called his nurse , eurycleia , and said to her :
0	meanwhile , athena , daughter of aegis-bearing zeus , threw her dress down on the floor of her father 's house , a soft robe , richly embroidered , which she would made with her own hands
0	the way he did
0	expressions of compassionate condescension may be heard in the most varied camps of the spirit -- and of lack of spirit
0	and described them to me
0	and what fate has befallen him
0	telemachus lay there all night long , wrapped up
0	a man ca not be well skilled in everything
0	an endless sleep , so there among the leaves ,
0	son of atreus , that famous spearman ,
0	from high up in the roof
0	tell me , so we will both know
0	but when i saw that ,
0	noblemachaon , think about how this battle will end up—the shouting from our young men by the shipsis getting louder
0	you will not talk me into it
0	in front the mules drew on the four-wheeled wagon , led by wise idaios
0	i would suggest you stay away
0	if you asked me to stay for one whole year ,
0	then a dog lying there raised its head and pricked up its ears
0	not once was there a favourable wind ,
0	be blessed among all men , get everything
0	there the trojans and dardanians were seated in a meeting , a general assembly , awaiting his return
0	the sun went down ,
0	and spoke to his own heart :
0	me and my father
0	the woman spoke to them again and said :
0	she unhinged their minds , so laughter from their mouths came from an alien source , and the meat they ate became blood-spattered
0	by the muses ' clear-toned song
0	i have got a shovel used for winnowing
0	will start their wicked schemes to hurt you later—
0	as my ship left the beetling cliffs behind ,
0	and started weaving something very big ,
0	he who would destroy the opera must take up the struggle against alexandrian cheerfulness , which expresses itself so naïvely in opera concerning its favorite idea
0	gifts he had received from iphitus , his friend ,
0	so he had to ask himself : have i always labeled unintelligible things i could not understand ?
0	aphrodite spoke , stirring emotion in helen 's heart
0	every day and night zeus sends , they kill
0	the killer of argus , god 's messenger , stood there , marveling at the sight
0	hera and athena muttered , sitting together , plotting trouble for the trojans
0	nausicaa brought her fine clothing from her room
0	with her she brought
0	but an evil fate was leading him towards his death , destroyed at your hands , menelaus , in lethal war
0	pour some sweet wine into jars for me ,
0	for every day i get my joy from mourning ,
0	saying this , cebriones urged on their horses with the lovely manes , cracking his whip over them
0	for i can explain the doric state and doric art only as a constant apollonian war camp
0	i will remind you of these things once more , so you will stop your malicious trickery , so you will see the advantages you getfrom this seduction , this couch where you layto have sex with me , when you came from the godsintending to deceive me
0	with more wealth in hand
0	dionysian art also wants to convince us of the eternal delight in existence
0	and see it through just as i tell you ?
0	but of brave odysseus ,
0	he made that net
0	idomeneus yanked his long spear out of the corpse
0	antinous , in our hearts do we truly know or not
0	but zeus ' mind is always stronger than a man 's
0	ripped to shreds by the power of that wind
0	priam stood up , descendant of dardanus , wise as the gods
0	she made him recall his father , even more so than before
0	i grabbed its back
0	to sit now in your home , for there 's a chance
0	standing near him , athena spoke
0	but if that 's your wish , if your heart 's set on it , you have that bedroom your own son hephaestushad built for you
0	old woman , you can rejoice in your own heart—but do not cry out aloud
0	and serve as his attendant there in troy ,
0	which forces her to leave
0	from left to right , beginning from the place
0	a man who 's done a lot of wandering
0	then he laughed with triumph , driving the sure-footed horses past the ditch
0	hector with his gleaming helmet scowled and said : polydamas , i do not like what you have just said
0	how can you get this cure ?
0	but then sweet sleep came over me—i was too worn out
0	and question you , then reassure them ,
0	for king pheidon said he would welcomed him with entertainments ,
0	my dear mother , although quite sensible ,
0	you can not be odysseus , my father
0	one of the immortal gods
0	but odysseus did not forget his various tricks
0	he stole ares secretly
0	but my warrior spirit did not listen
0	to my young goats , then he could drink down whey and put some muscle on those thighs of his
0	then , removing the cover from his quiver , pandarus took out an arrow , a fresh-winged courier bearing dark agony
0	then odysseus got up and set off for the city
0	many times you soaked the shirt on my chest , slobbering your wine , a helpless baby
0	i am willing to give up all of it , even to add to it things of my own
0	i saw themwheeling round the turning post in front
0	the poor man 's miserable
0	since he 's a younger man of my own age ,
0	but that 's not what they have done
0	that 's how keen he was to kill the trojans
0	a sword completely made of bronze ,
0	among my servants , if some other one
0	through the former a phenomenon becomes more impoverished than it is , whereas through dionysian music the individual phenomenon becomes richer and widens into an image of the world
0	to go about their tasks
0	since you have questioned me , i will tell you the truth
0	wise telemachus then answered her and said :
0	a resourceful man , who won himself
0	the gods pitied odysseus ,
0	and keep this home with me
0	irus any more , judging from the thighs
0	the cattle herder philoetius
0	as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared ,
0	as you will need to satisfy your wants
0	for a short time we really are the primordial essence itself and feel its unbridled lust for and joy in existence
0	after he would told them all his prophecies ,
0	one you ca not escape
0	the two approached , came up , and stood there before cloud-gatherer zeus
0	as i remember them
0	had returned and come back to his palace
0	he wo not stop cutting men down with his bronze , for zeus is giving him the glory
0	son of atreus , indeed i will prove myselfa loyal comrade to you , as i promised that first time long ago
0	and so , my lad ,
0	and enjoy each other 's wretched troubles ,
0	for to us who stand on the boundary line between two different forms of existence , the hellenic prototype retains this immeasurable value , that all these transitions and struggles are imprinted upon it in a classically instructive form ; except that we , as it were , pass through the chief epochs of the hellenic genius , analogically in reverse order , and seem now , for instance , to be passing backward from the alexandrian age to the period of tragedy
0	some wove fabric , or sitting down , twisted yarn , hands fluttering like leaves on a tall poplar tree , while olive oil dripped down
0	as if he were a god , and sent him in a ship
0	listen to me , friends
0	knows if , before that wedding day arrives ,
0	she had a young lad at her breast , a child , who now , i think , sits down among the men , happy his dear father will notice him
0	twenty of the women
0	when they gulp it down and drink too much
0	he 's got something he wants to say
0	he went off to the storeroom
0	are you going to take me still further off , to some well-populated city somewherein phrygia or beautiful maeonia , because you are in love with some mortal manand menelaus has just beaten parisand wants to take me , a despised woman , back home with him ?
0	penelope spoke , and the old woman held her hands over her face and shed warm tears
0	i wo not just tell you odysseus will be back—
0	how can you claim i am hanging back from battleeach time we achaeans rouse ourselves for waragainst horse-taming trojans ?
0	when they had sex with them in secret
0	before he gets back to his native land ,
0	midway between the earth and starry heaven , zeus reached mount ida with its many springs , mother of wild beasts
0	for any one of them who injures him
0	a voice from zeus , which often brings men news
0	so the two of them reached out to take the fine food
0	athena , zeus ' daughter , goddess of war 's spoils , was first to stand before you , to ward off the piercing arrow—she brushed it from your skin , just as a mother brushes a fly off her child while he lies sweetly sleeping
0	he cheated me , betrayed me
0	he moved out of lord agamemnon 's line of sight , to one side , then struck his forearm with his spear , just below the elbow
0	out of my arms , like a shadow or a dream
0	had died , brought to their knees , since she
0	many enemies are now devising schemes
0	at once he was helped along by female servants made of gold , who moved to him
0	without a sign of fear , strong diomedes then replied :
0	that way we would escape from trouble as quickly as we could
0	a glancing blow across the wrist
0	in reading omens from the birds
0	but with his sword diomedes jumped at him , slashed him across the middle of his neck , slicing through both tendons
0	if his feet outrun ours , we will keep following himand chase him from his camp towards our ships
0	they were in such a rush to shift him
0	where to put this wealth
0	the sheer rock precipice
0	his brothers and comrades collected hector 's ash-white bones , as they mourned him— heavy tears running down their cheeks—and placed them in a golden urn , wrapped in soft purple cloth
0	at least that 's what he was to me
0	she dressed me in immortal clothing , and sent a wind ,
0	with socrates as his ally , euripides dared to be the herald of a new artistic creativity
0	when the wrapped-up thigh bones were completely cooked , and they would tasted samples of the inner organs , they chopped up the rest , arranged the meat on spits , cooked it carefully , then drew it from the fire
0	with these words , hector roused each man 's fighting spirit
0	these men are courting me against my will
0	holding his round shield in front of him , he stepped lightly forward , under cover of that shield
0	could stretch the string on that powerful bow
0	simoeis produced ambrosia for them to eat
0	the famous crippled god then answered thetis :
0	is he still held in honour among the many myrmidons ?
0	then they dined all day long until the sun went down
0	after a convoy on the misty seas ,
0	however , if we see how , under the pressure of this peace agreement , the dionysian power revealed itself , then we now understand the meaning of the festivals of world redemption and days of transfiguration in the dionysian orgies of the greeks , in comparison with the babylonian sacaea , which turned human beings back into tigers and apes
0	that i should place a huge loom in the halls
0	i think i now respect you even more , since you have dared to come outside the wall , to help me , when you saw me in distress , while others all remained inside
0	at that point many spirits will emerge—they ’ re the shadows of the dead
0	when they would had their heart 's content of food and drink , telemachus leaned his head close to nestor 's son , so no one else could hear , and spoke to him :
0	so take the shining reins and whip
0	as when we were setting up an ambush
0	after my recognition of that tremendous opposition , i sensed in myself a strong urge to approach the essence of greek tragedy and , in so doing , the deepest insight into the hellenic genius
0	why do you carry such a bow , as useless as the wind ?
0	he would been away so long , and pallas athena ,
0	and then he will know the gods who love himare the best of the immortals and those godswho up to now have guarded trojansin this war 's battles have only little power , as feeble as the wind
0	so it was right for me , gave me a bath ,
0	someone can hide a ravenous stomach—
0	for one can quickly get too much of sorrow ,
0	then , with a great shout , he called out to his trojans :
0	who possessed the power of song
0	idomeneus ' pitiless bronze then struck erymas right in his mouth—the spear forced itself straight through , below his brain , splitting his white skull apart , smashing out his teeth
0	taking on the likeness of a man , mentes , leader of the cicones , apollo addressed hector with these winged words :
0	on both sides—each has a narrow entrance ,
0	swift iris , with feet like wind , went on ahead
0	the two winds rose up
0	the bronze breastplate he wore was no protection
0	then far-seeing zeus carried out a scheme
0	who in his looks and body was the best
0	that 's what he will boast
0	are planning nasty things against me
0	angry at zeus , her father , athena sat there silently , so enraged she did not say a word
0	the nymph then dressed me in a cloak and tunic
0	the brooch on it was made of gold—it had
0	when fair-haired dawn gave birth to the third day , with my sharp sword and spear i quickly climbed
0	but all the suitors looked around at one another
0	youmyrmidons , companions of achilles , son of peleus , be men , my friends , recall your fighting strength , so we may honour the son of peleus , by far the best achaean at the ships , with the finest comrades in a close combat
0	i will collect the soldiers
0	then glaucus , son of hippolochus , commanderof the lycians , looking at hector with a frown , criticized him harshly :
0	you will recite the details of this story , i will tell all men how , of his own free will ,
0	each one receiving just what zeus desires
0	you wretched stranger , your mind lacks any sense—you have none at all
0	then they set off , back to phaeacia
0	but meriones went after him , as he moved back , and hit him underneath his navel , in the scrotum , the most agonizing way for men to perish miserably in battle
0	perhaps i might have been able to do that !
0	then , splitting up , we fanned out in three different groups to hunt
0	where they will stay safely stored inside for you
0	how i would join in with fighters in the front
0	enraged at leucus ' slaughter , odysseus strode up , through the front ranks , armed in gleaming bronze
0	teucer 's lot gave him first attempt
0	amphinomus , you seem to be a man
0	the quality of mentor , alcimus ' son ,
0	so many riches stored in pheidon 's home ,
0	instead , you will be content to eat the food supplies which goddess circe gave
0	until i reached a river , which i thought
0	to the famous city of the myrmidons ,
0	give nestor and his sons a glorious name ,
0	so she went through the house
0	i staggered out and fell down on the beach ,
0	a fine intelligence , and thus for women
0	teucer , with a shudder , spoke out to his brother ajax :
0	they are to be locked in so that they do not interrupt the revenge killings or run off to raise a general alarm
0	the dogs went first , ahead of them , following the tracks
0	i know your courage
0	those close to himhad better stay here in a single groupto help him off , once my fists have thrashed him
0	a dreadful flash came from the blazing sulphur
0	he yanked the stake
0	are pestering my mother against her will
0	white-armed hera sent me
0	sarpedon 's speech stung hector 's heart
0	at their heart-rending pride and wicked acts
0	who work to earn their bread
0	for you to talk in person to the stranger , to hear for yourself what he has to say
0	fair-haired hecamede made them a soothing drink
0	they yoked the horses , climbed in the ornate chariot , then drove out from the echoing portico and gate
0	but come , let 's all follow what i now propose
0	why should i praise my mother ?
0	in earlier ages men had set it there to indicate the boundary of a field
0	charge into a snare set in a thicket , as they seek out
0	the one that forms the ocean 's navel stone
0	you have come here to olympus , goddess thetis , though you are grieving , with endless sorrowsin your heart
0	once he spoke , they all heard him and obeyed at once
0	in that shape , apollo , zeus ' son , spoke out :
0	the spear point sliced his tendons , and darkness closed his eyes
0	which they would received from circe earlier
0	created by hephaestus 's matchless artistry ,
0	he forgot , or else grew careless , a lapse within his foolish heart
0	to the well-decked ship and stowed it all in place , as odysseus ' dear son instructed them to do
0	the beaters reached a clearing
0	hear me , god of the silver bow , protectorof chryse , mighty lord of holy cilla , sacred tenedos
0	into a well-constructed settlement
0	agamemnon dragged a swift ship down the shore , chose twenty sailors , loaded on the oxen , offerings for the god , and led on fair-cheeked chryseis
0	but shrewd odysseus , once he would raised the bow and looked it over
0	when wise athena puts it in my mind ,
0	about floating back to grim charybdis
0	i will take you to my wise father 's house ,
0	there a man who had no need of sleep
0	when zeus , cronos ' son ,
0	if alexander 's killed and priamand priam 's children are unwillingto reimburse me , then i will remain here , fight on until i am fully satisfied , until i end this war appropriately
0	you say the city is a long way off
0	let your heart be brave , priam , son of dardanus
0	you must attend to the lid yourself ,
0	addressed antinous , reprimanding him :
0	saying a prayer , he set one aside for hermes , son of maia ,
0	take me alive , and i will ransom myself
0	i am not sitting in my bedroom hereout of spite or anger with the trojans
0	and you , my friend , best wishes to you , too
0	he climbed into his chariot and told his driver to go back to the hollow ships
0	but the trojans , though confident with their long spears , did not kill anyone , for all their eagerness
0	you should prepare your dinner and then eat , here in the city , as before
0	i came to see this land with my own eyes
0	the arrow , weighted with bronze , went straight through and out the other end
0	in a bowl carved out of ivy wood he mixed wine sweet as honey
0	once we would come up really close beside her ,
0	who dance the best , perform for us , and then
0	with these words , bright-eyed athena went back to olympus ,
0	still , he did not escape his fate
0	breach that argive wall
0	but as i thought about it ,
0	a wife whose excellence was truly great
0	with a groan , the gates of heaven opened on their own , those gates which the seasons , custodians of olympus and great heaven , too , look after , pushing open the heavy cloud , then pushing it shut once more
0	antenor , i am not pleased with what you have said
0	in his mind can somehow weave a plan ,
0	men famous for their ships , spoke to one another—
0	antilochus took the prize for coming last
0	away from his companions
0	but by examining the husk , i think ,
0	o circe , how can you ask me to be kind to you ?
0	who wandered far and wide after ravaging
0	among these men , no one
0	my child , do not let such things distress your heart
0	take us alive , son of atreus
0	a harvest-offering , first fruits of his orchard
0	as he thought it through , the best thing seemed to be
0	all memories of home
0	pity filled my heart
0	keep this firmly in your mind
0	the sceptre-bearing king , whose powerful authority comes from zeus , never shares honours equally
0	we stretch our hands out toward this image , and nature reaches its goal through the deception
0	and the two princes here agree with me ,
0	then you must go to hades ' murky home
0	but if you are having trouble where you are , with fights erupting , then let mighty ajax , son of telamon , come by himself
0	is not it enough that zeus , cronos ' son , gives me this grief , that i must lose my son , the best one of them all ?
0	to see if we have any options left
0	my good mother , why this wish to have me slaughtered ?
0	men worked hard , falling each tree with a mighty crash
0	but i will go back now
0	its roots were black ,
0	we will get the people to provide the cost
0	meanwhile , the other men kept up the fight , kept on butchering each other
0	you would tell me where he 's hiding from my rage
0	he will tell you your course , the distance you must go on your return ,
0	when they reached the stately palace , they put their cloaks down on the seats and armchairs ,
0	from the basket where it lay , and then he hurled it
0	poseidon heard him make this boastful claim
0	my family or my native land , in case
0	on getting married , then let her return
0	in some hidden corner of this sacred cave ,
0	offered prizes to some fine phoenicians ,
0	but when odysseus ' dear son arrives ,
0	there are two gates for insubstantial dreams ,
0	as a fine dancing and assembly ground
0	and from alcinous , the king
0	so let no one hereturn back towards the ships , now you have heardfrom your commander
0	to fight against those who outnumber you—
0	for whom many trojans and achaeans
0	telemachus said this , then flicked the horses with his whip
0	by swallowing salt water
0	report my words precisely
0	we could not see a thing , and all our ships
0	in the wooden horse ?
0	good philoetius , i want you to lock
0	you will soon come out from under these bad times
0	how the rest of our comrades came to grief
0	the upper hand , until achaeans respect my son , until they multiply his honours
0	the suitors kept throwing spears with frantic haste , but , though there were many , athena made them miss
0	brought him to crete , as he was sailing on ,
0	agonizing groans came from those his sword then butchered
0	then all the other sons of the achaeans
0	yes , menelaus has just defeated me , but with athena 's help
0	have not you alreadybeen cooped up long enough within those walls ?
0	and now , racked with grief and mourning , he shed tears as he addressed them :
0	among the argives , who were the first and last men killed by hector , son of priam , and brazen ares ?
0	to the stranger , verbally and with a gift ,
0	her voice held back every man in that whole army
0	so come now , before he calls achaeans
0	if this very day cronos ' son stirred up
0	you clearly know full well , because you heard me say it—i am intending
0	take courage , diomedes , in this fight with trojans
0	they sat there , on the tower , these trojan elders , like cicadas perched up on a forest branch , chirping soft , delicate sounds
0	concerning me—so i would be reduced
0	they prepared wine in the mixing bowl , then poured water over the kings ' hands
0	sthenelus jumped down on the ground
0	and make your prayers there to athena ,
0	for nine days apollo rained death down upon the troops
0	trojans then threw their full weight straight at the danaans , holding spears up high , their hearts hoping they would drag that body away from ajax , son of telamon
0	the way you talk , so he can cut you up ,
0	glorious son of atreus , king of men , agamemnon—counselor zeus wo not fulfillall the things that hector has in mind ,
0	so now , after suffering so much anguish ,
0	the way he used to or inspects the fields ,
0	of getting home someday
0	those who wish to court a noble lady ,
0	she made his helmet blaze with tireless flames , his shield as well—like a late star in summer which shines especially bright , newly risen from its bath in ocean 's streams
0	on the twelfth , some god threw him back again into achilles ' hands , who was about to ship him , against lycaon 's wishes , down to dwell with hades
0	struck each man , then penned them in her pigsties
0	and then go home and rest
0	then he spoke out to his master :
0	and set it down before him
0	so come , suitors , since your prize seems to be
0	all achaea 's sons roared out , approving what horse-taming diomedes said
0	clasping his hands with words of welcome
0	they heard him shouting out
0	when you think we have had time to reach my home , then go in the city
0	that 's how godlike ajax chopped down simoeisius , son of anthemion
0	as these men toiled in frantic battle , powerful fate drove strong , brave tlepolemus , son of hercules , against godlike sarpedon
0	but i would do the same
0	that torment which brings men so many troubles
0	the men broke up in groups and organized themselves to form five companies , with each one following its own leadership
0	so argives were forced to move back from the ships ' first row
0	so glaucus prayed then to apollo :
0	then , suddenly he pushed the table from him with his foot , spilling food onto the floor—the bread and roasted meat
0	now , if somehow you could set an ambush
0	they killed a heifer from the herd , plump hogs as well , as they prepared the meal
0	he 's knocked the bow out of my hands and snapped
0	do not you recall the moment you provokeddiomedes , tydeus ' son , to wound me ?
0	the man who wants to fight courageouslymust stand his ground with force , whether he 's hit , or whether his blows strike the other man
0	he was the one who would made well-balanced ships for paris at the start of all the trouble , bringing disaster on the trojans and on paris , too , for he was ignorant of what gods had decreed
0	stored in a polished chest inlaid with gold ,
0	two feet each way
0	xanthus , and you podargus , aithus , noble lampus !
0	so die , all you fleeing trojans , until we reachthat sacred city ilion , with me there , right behind you , fighting and killing you
0	i answered her and said :
0	nobody is killing me , my friends ,
0	that 's how pallas athena shot to earth , then dropped right down into the middle of the soldiers
0	to follow what i say
0	when trojans saw mighty idomeneus , like some flame , and his attendant meriones in his richly shining armour , they called out to each other in the crowd , then made a massive charge
0	armour from the storeroom
0	and cliffs rise up in a sheer face of rock
0	standing at one end , chipped and tapered it
0	not since the day a man from aetolia
0	as odysseus did before
0	she gave it me , and , when i would drunk it , without being bewitched ,
0	he was just starting to recover , to recognize his comrades round him
0	that would have stilled his heart and stopped his fighting at achaean ships , if teucer had hit him as he was showing off how brave he was
0	come , you leader of your people , let me be
0	then each man went to his hut , where he lay down and stretched out to take the gift of sleep
0	this serenity is a counterpart to the marvelous naïveté of the old greeks , which we must see—in accordance with its given characteristics—as the flowering of apollonian culture , blossoming out of a dark abyss , as the victory over suffering , the wisdom of suffering , which the hellenic will gains through its ability to mirror beauty
0	nearby was teucer , who would just come from his huts
0	seeing helen approach the tower , they commented softly to each other—their words had wings :
0	apollonian tendencies metamorphosed into logical systematizing , something corresponding to what we noticed with euripides , as well as a translation of the dionysian into naturalistic effects
0	leader of your people , send me back now
0	we must report this news , though it 's not good , to the danaans waiting to receive it
0	will send you following winds
0	and i saw maera and clymene ,
0	without spilling any blood
0	when i went away i did not leave behind anyone to protect my property
0	sly aegisthus , who would killed agamemnon , that splendid man
0	has suffered such anxiety
0	and then lost , one she would had loving sex with
0	then nestor came across the kings the gods sustain— they were walking round among the ships—all the ones whom bronze had wounded—diomedes and odysseus , along with agamemnon , son of atreus
0	goddess athena with the gleaming eyes then said to him :
0	and i will speak the truth—if , on my behalf
0	so now conduct this stranger to your home ,
0	how unintelligible must faust , the modern cultured man , who is in himself intelligible , have appeared to a true greek -- faust , storming unsatisfied through all the faculties , devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge ; faust , whom we have but to place beside socrates for the purpose of comparison , in order to see that modern man is beginning to divine the limits of this socratic love of knowledge and yearns for a coast in the wide waste of the ocean of knowledge
0	she simply could not stop her white arms holding him
0	three times my spirit prompted me to grasp her , and i jumped ahead
0	helen spoke in tears
0	when immortal night arrived , we lay down
0	and there 's a double gateway well fenced in
0	but you are either weary after so much action , your limbs worn out , or fear has made you timid
0	make sure you ask him
0	when they annoy her , daughter of a mighty father
0	then she heard the wailing , laments coming from the walls
0	and if we get home , make it to ithaca , our native land ,
0	nature and the ideal , he says , are either objects of grief , when the former is represented as lost , the latter unattained ; or both are objects of joy , in that they are represented as real
0	hera has seduced him on a bed of love
0	we will give you the loveliestof agamemnon 's daughters , bring her herefrom argos , so you can wed her , if you , for your part , will join us to destroythe well-built city ilion
0	and was the finer man
0	but i stayed there undaunted , till my mother
0	you are like a king , the kind of man who bathes
0	i will tell you something else—take it to heart
0	daughter of tough-minded atlas , who knows
0	matching what they received themselves—telemachus , godlike odysseus ' son , had given them those orders
0	the spartan plain and its surrounding hills ,
0	so he moved away
0	brings gifts and puts them in the chariot ,
0	he took with him the royal staff of his ancestors , eternal and imperishable
0	forgetting everything i have had to bear ,
0	patroclus ordered his companions and the women servants to set upa sturdy bed without delay for phoenix
0	odysseus would come home—that 's what i want
0	but some time past his fate had struck him and he would gone down to the house of hades
0	as they were reaching for the food , old dolius appeared
0	they quickly led out seven women , all well skilled in lovely handiwork
0	sweet sleep quickly slipped around him
0	i do not think you can evade poseidon ,
0	he slumped onto his side , and , as he was hit ,
0	hector slew stichius and arcesilaus— one a leader of bronze-armed boeotians , one a trusted comrade of brave menestheus
0	in proper order at each rowing bench ,
0	make fun of him , as well , when he arrives
0	they fill their ships and then sail off for home
0	things you really need
0	once he would told her everything ,
0	the initiates in the eleusinian mysteries hoped for a rebirth of dionysus , which we now can understand as the mysterious end of individuation
0	lived among men in my home , a rich man
0	it was astonishing—crates full of cheese , pens crammed with livestock—lambs and kids
0	but i see him for myself
0	close by them , resourceful odysseus stood among his troops , cephallenian soldiers , powerful fighting men
0	he spoke out immediately
0	but when dawn appears , you should stir yourselves so you can set me in my misery
0	but what if i let achilles , son of peleus , drive them on , then dash away myself to some other place , far from the wall , out in the trojan plain , until i reachida 's spurs , where there 's a bush to hide in ?
0	what fills your heart—since you have now stopped
0	with this cupachilles poured libations to no god but father zeus
0	she climbed the lofty staircase to her chamber ,
0	even within a well-built farm
0	or to enjoy myself with my mind relaxed
0	the title old man of the sea , the name given to proteus in menelaus ' account of his adventures in egypt ( in book ) , is applied here to phorcys as well
0	the same duality lay over the construction of the drama , as well as over the meaning of the chorus
0	but come , tell me—
0	we found them all quite cheerful , eating
0	later on we will collect throughout the land
0	he said that he had seen odysseus
0	back to the ship and urged my comrades
0	was epicurus an optimist for the very reason that he was suffering ?
0	belonging to cyclops was lying there
0	will stand as witnesses for both of us
0	acts which go on and on , without an end
0	men put their trust in weaker friends than me—
0	now both of us share a common fate , to redden the same earthright here in troy
0	without offering some gift for us to take ,
0	a lovely , finely woven garment , and tied
0	but for the moment , let 's agree to dine , though i hate to eat
0	the warrior who would struck himwas not the weakest of achaeans
0	are you in truth odysseus ' son ?
0	your dear sonis ransomed for that huge amount you paid
0	when zeus ' seasons load their tops with fruit
0	over the body acamas shouted then in triumph :
0	one ash spear , weighted down with bronze , fell against the wall
0	of what the heart inside my chest is urging
0	if you are holding back in this grim fight , then now 's the day the trojans overcome us
0	he 's still alive and looking at the sunlight
0	could set a bride price for his daughter
0	or other tunics here
0	earthshaker poseidon led them , gripping in his powerful fist a fearful sword , with a long edge , like a lightning bolt , which no man in grim battle could withstand—his fear would hold him back
0	someone who looks so much like someone else ,
0	they will runback to achilles ' ships with many oars
0	asked them to sit down on soft cushions and eat
0	of our strong bedroom
0	then the young men warmed the bow and tested it
0	than a glimpse of one 's own native land
0	returning from his travels—there 's still room
0	people really loved him , for he lived beside a roadand welcomed all passers-by into his home
0	past men 's farms , walk fast with my attendants
0	so achilles awarded it to nestor
0	here the trojans and their allies marshaled forces
0	let it remain in your dear mother 's room
0	if someone just feels the urge to change himself and to speak out from other bodies and souls , then that person is a dramatist
0	that 's what the herder of the bent-horned cattle said
0	more so than to all other mortal men ,
0	is it a public or a private matter ?
0	stored bread and wine and special delicacies ,
0	had heard it from hermes the messenger
0	is he a younger or a senior man ?
0	then resourceful odysseus answered him and said :
0	then meges killed pedaeus , antenor 's bastard son
0	first of all , let 's drag the ship onshore , stow all our goods and tackle in the caves
0	all the pains which grieve my mind and heart
0	once hera finished , ares struck his sturdy thighs with the flat of his hands and , in his grief , burst out :
0	a valued female servant
0	for you , and for your ship
0	the old man of the sea comes here from egypt , i mean infallible , eternal proteus ,
0	i was the one who gave him that clothing
0	in our case , all our throws fall wasted on the ground
0	with excellent moorage , and from that spot
0	what about achaea 's other sons , the younger ones ?
0	at the stern , so odysseus could sleep in peace
0	he climbed down from the chariot and said :
0	they heard exquisite music , from apollo 's lyre and the muses ' beautiful song and counter-song
0	when they are servants to nobility
0	after that , enjoy your stories
0	for you , who kept watch over for us , are dead
0	and try to learn if one of the women
0	your parents ' breeding has not been destroyed—
0	and gives me fame and honour
0	the soldiers heard him and obeyed
0	the immortal gods to see if zeus
0	in cyprus , where she has her sanctuary , her sacred altar
0	from his own home , seeking to prevail with gifts
0	all phaeacians sat in silence , without saying a word , spellbound in the shadowy hall
0	to see them again with my own eyes
0	you must be brave
0	in his own farmyard , but the swineherd ran up fast behind them , dropping the leather in his hands
0	and kept shooting volleys of swift arrows
0	married because she was so beautiful ,
0	even if a major quarrel should arise ?
0	scowling at him , cloud-gatherer zeus replied :
0	have paid the price of their proud arrogance
0	later , with the corpses on the plain , you will have timeto strip off bodies of the slaughtered men
0	your mother and your father and the others , those in the town and in the countryside
0	friends , up to this point , we have not been strangers to misfortunes
0	the form of the greek theatre is a reminder of a solitary mountain valley
0	but when the storms
0	i would be called a coward , a nobody , if i held back from any actionbecause of something you might say
0	they did not wish to cheat me , but were blown
0	hector , you are always taking me to task , though i give good advice in our assemblies
0	well , i suppose i will remain a coward ,
0	the plastic artist as well as his relation , the epic poet , is absorbed in the pure contemplation of images
0	a basic issue is the relationship of the greeks to pain , the degree of their sensitivity
0	and taken from her arms and legs all sense of fear
0	ares stirred his battle spirit , planning his death at aeneas ' hand
0	who are you among men ?
0	who has no clothes or wealth , some pauper ,
0	to a man in such a mood , however , an old athenian , looking up at him with the sublime eyes of aeschylus , might reply : but say this , too , curious stranger : how much did this people have to suffer to be able to become so beautiful !
0	but i am not the man to tell achaea 's sonsto drag our well-decked ships into the seaif they are not willing
0	but move out of the hall and sit outside ,
0	but he pined away at heart , remaining idle by his ships , yearning for the hue and cry and clash of battle
0	but all these matters
0	from that mound they built a wall ,
0	now my shipshave brought me here as a destroying force , against you , your father , and other trojans
0	were full of spite :
0	achilles turned again on agamemnon , atreus ' son , with harsh abuse , his anger still unabated :
0	the tale of your misfortunes
0	really bad , while his son is still alive ,
0	let 's go to that crowd
0	around her , all her servants
0	i have roamed through many lands
0	you slaughtered many men
0	we had to endure while on board the ships ,
0	fight the immortal gods all by himself ,
0	so they were feasting
0	that 's why you should never treat them kindly , not even your own wife
0	herdsman , you do not appear to be a man
0	aeneas then said in response :
0	to leave the dark heart of the wood
0	phoebus apollo heard him
0	and patroclus , too , a man whose counsel
0	and it 's not right for us to linger here
0	let 's call on gods to witness , for they are the best ones to observe our pact , to supervise what we two agree on
0	they reached the two fair-flowing well springs which feed swirling scamander 's stream
0	to deny him what he asked
0	next , she laid out a wide variety of food ,
0	of our healers , podalerius and machaon , one , i believe , lies wounded in our huts , himself requiring some worthy healer , the other 's out there on the plains , holding offthe fighting spirit of the trojans
0	but hector is a mortal man , suckled at a woman 's breast , while achillesis the child of a goddess i raised myself
0	and focus on your journey home , i think
0	these men report back
0	the fact that death and not exile was pronounced over him socrates himself appears to have brought about , fully clear about what he was doing and without the natural horror of death
0	especially to athena , zeus ' bright-eyed daughter
0	now he slept in peace , forgetting all his troubles
0	the two men drank and quenched their parching thirst
0	father zeus , who rules both gods and men , you have thundered loud up in the starry sky ,
0	will be difficult to bear
0	on his head he set a cap of marten skin , grabbed a sharp spear , and set off , going from the camp towards the ships
0	the i of the lyric poet thus echoes out of the abyss of being
0	listen to me now
0	from the cave mighty polyphemus roared :
0	so we two stood there in sad conversation ,
0	and questioned him in person :
0	with fewer men and only six ships , he sackedthe trojan city and emptied all its streets
0	who devised this plan all on your own ,
0	inside the cave with a huge crash
0	excel all women for your form , your stature ,
0	round both ajaxes soldiers made a stand and strongly held their ground
0	as they talked about the kind of man
0	besides , it ’ s easy to recognize the gods
0	he says you should wait around till sunset
0	but at that moment ,
0	that 's what they thought as they fought one another
0	noble ajax , son of telamon , leader of your people
0	here they found achilles ' shade , son of peleus ,
0	just as the great sea heaves with a sullen purple swell , anticipating the swift passage of sharp winds— but uncertainly—so its waves have no direction , until some steady storm blows down from zeus—that 's how
0	son of iasus , once the mighty king
0	he set off among bronze-clad achaeans , seeking heroic machaon
0	among the suitors , each in turn
0	a huge white goose , a tame one from some farm
0	down in the hold , just like a sea bird 's fall
0	but you have worked very hard , endured a lot—you , your noble father , and your brother—in my cause
0	but if we two agreed , were of one mind , then troy 's fate would be sealed without delay , without a moment 's pause
0	and gave him the gold flask full of smooth olive oil
0	and wove a rope about six feet in length ,
0	for this is how it will end up , i think ,
0	i might come , if you sailors were willing to promise me on oath to take me home
0	but those beside the corpse kept holding their sharp spears , with no pause in the fighting
0	they have already been assembled ,
0	orestes slew his father 's murderer ,
0	all those who live in lovely woods , river springs , and grassy meadows came together at cloud-gatherer zeus ' home , seating themselveson porticoes of polished stone , built there by hephaestus ' cunning arts for his father zeus
0	besides , she had with her
0	trojans can expect from zeus more sorrows , more disasters
0	his heart and mind were not aware that gifts like that , splendid presents from the gods to mortal men , are not so easily defeated , nor do they fail
0	so far , however , such critics have constituted the audience : the student , the schoolboy , even the innocuous female had been unwittingly prepared by education and newspapers for this kind of perception of works of art
0	huge rivers , fearful waters , stand between us , first and foremost oceanus , which no man
0	but , my dear sir , what in the earth is romantic if your book is not ?
0	in their defensive wall ,
0	but they did not sleep for long , only for a while , since dawn soon reached there on her golden throne
0	is she still there with her son , keeping watch on everything ?
0	are a separate group , closer to the dawn
0	does wise penelope now know for certain
0	you will now find genuine welcome and respect
0	so helen spoke to hector with these soothing words :
0	the trojans ' wives and daughters ran up round him , asking after children , brothers , relatives , and husbands
0	i would be left behind ,
0	he left them there , to chase abas and polyidus , sons of old eurydamas , interpreter of dreams
0	to carry out the dead
0	with telemachus ' help he took away
0	then with his sharp spear menelaus , son of atreus , killed scamandrius , son of strophius , a huntsman
0	he was born on the banks of the river simoeis ,
0	they also include what is serious , cloudy , sad , dark , sudden scruples , teasing accidents , nervous expectations , in short , the entire divine comedy of life , including the inferno—all this moves past him , not just like a shadow play , for he lives and suffers in the midst of these scenes , yet not without that fleeting sensation of illusion
0	then he moved off
0	an outstanding man , served bread in a fine basket
0	anyone who murders just one person
0	but then zeus saved me—he gave me strength and made my legs run faster
0	they tied me hand and foot onto the ship ,
0	escaping scylla and dread charybdis ,
0	then athena , zeus ' daughter , came up to them ,
0	for his intelligence and offerings
0	he would fixed a footstool underneath , part of the chair , on which they usually threw a large sheep fleece
0	quite easily , like drifting down a stream
0	how i wish i would never won that contest !
0	but ajax , swift son of oïleus , killed the most
0	once inside the house and in the courtyard , move through the great hall quickly till you reach
0	it would be difficult
0	and observed odysseus , who already had the bow
0	herald , take this portion of our food
0	son of splendid menelaus , poured the wine
0	what demi-god is it to whom the ghostly chorus of the noblest specimens of humanity had to cry out : alas , alas !
0	so on the fifth beautiful calypso bathed him ,
0	she met thetis sitting in a hollow cave with other sea godsthronging there around her
0	i will choose from the many ships , new and old ,
0	hear what i have to say , so i can speak
0	and then zeus gave out a sign with a huge peal of thunder
0	dancing and song—the finest joys of dinner feasts
0	but apollo confronts us once again as the divine manifestation of the principii individuationis [ the individualizing principle ] , in which the eternally attained goal of the primordial oneness , its redemption through illusion , comes into being
0	paid no attention to their words
0	is odysseus still alive
0	zeus , son of cronos , gives me glory
0	but keep this news
0	calypso , the lovely goddess ,
0	so now , if you can , protect your son
0	in ithaca , he would have sent you on your way
0	today 's a banquet day for everyone
0	his relatives , men and women , wo not be burying him , once he 's dead , with the proper rites of fire
0	across from them , antilochus lamented , eyes full of tears , as he held achilles by the hand
0	if so , i will pray to you
0	just a single man against so many
0	with some made-up tale
0	but menelaus was bringing his swift horses in very close behind
0	agamemnon , you are an excellent man , but do not take briseis from achilles
0	my dear lady , you are always fancying things
0	you can rest assured—no other odysseus
0	and then , when we ,
0	have killed my animals , the very ones
0	the dionysian truth takes over the entire realm of myth as the symbol of its knowledge and speaks of this knowledge , partly in the public culture of the tragedy and partly in the secret celebrations of the dramatic mystery celebrations , but always in the disguise of the old myths
0	were sons of troy and pallas athena
0	but you must not rejoinares ' conflict until with your own eyes you see me in the morning here again
0	they struck the gray sea with their oar blades
0	three times you circled round ,
0	she fed them and took good care of the old man ,
0	all around , earth chuckled to see that gleaming bronze
0	why are you so irritated , hera and athena ?
0	as he sat in the hall , inciting all his comrades
0	and choose a painful death
0	on top of these , he would setan eighth layer made of bronze
0	given this insight , we can call the chorus , in its primitive stages of the prototypical tragedy , the self-reflection of dionysian men , a phenomenon which we can make out most clearly in the experience of the actor , who , if he is really gifted , sees perceptibly before his eyes the image of the role he has to play , hovering there for him to grasp
0	when he suddenly showed up , not even
0	achilles looked at priam , marveling at his royal appearance and the words he heard
0	just as freezing snowflakes fall thick and fast from zeus , driven by the raging sky-born north wind—that 's how crowds of them streamed out then , pouring from the ships— brightly gleaming helmets , strong-plated body armour , ash spears and embossed shields—the glitter of it allflashed up to heaven
0	outside the hall , and sat down there , by the altar of great zeus , peering round in all directions ,
0	to cause trouble for the thesprotians ,
0	and then summon there
0	achaeans , what telemachus has said
0	diomedes slept with the hide of a field ox spread out under him and a bright rug underneath his head
0	but how seldom does the naïve , that sense of being completely swallowed up in the beauty of appearance , succeed
0	over three human generations
0	no one dared stay put as he came in—all rose together
0	but now these suitors
0	theseus brought her once away from crete
0	if she would known achaea 's warrior sons
0	diverting your attention from this bow string
0	my gleaming belt protected me on top , as did my body chain mail underneath , forged in bronze
0	calling the cyclops , although around me
0	phoebus apollo has saved you one more time
0	and achaeans will give others , till they fill up each and every pen
0	with your wife and children there beside you ,
0	here , take this veil—
0	the suitors in their hearts felt immediately overwhelmed
0	welcomed me , without demanding ransom
0	next on that shield , the celebrated lame god madean elaborately crafted dancing floor , like the one daedalus created long ago in spacious cnossus , for ariadne with the lovely hair
0	as soon as they gave out the order , the task was done
0	and live among the dead
0	cloud-gatherer zeus then said to poseidon in reply :
0	i do not know any other people , none of those who hold
0	to a dear friend
0	just as two furious wild boars fall on the dogs chasing after them , that 's how diomedes and odysseus turned back again to slaughter trojans
0	at once he recognized pallas athena , the dreadful glitter in her eyes
0	how i wishyou never had been born or died unmarried
0	someone ( i do not know who ) asserted that all individuals , as individuals , have to be taken as comic and thus untragic , that the greeks in general could not tolerate individuals in their tragic theatre
0	a fair , well-balanced mind ?
0	when he heard these words ,
0	only one ocean ship ,
0	those arrogant suitors who upset this home ,
0	at that point , the argives might well have gone back— contravening what fate had proposed for them—if hera had not spoken to athena :
0	he did not reply , but left ,
0	zeus heard of it and annihilated him
0	be brave , dear nurse , for i have not planned this without help from a god
0	twelve choice bulls as offerings to poseidon ,
0	with them went chromius , and godlike aretus , fully hoping in their hearts they would kill the men , then drive those strong-necked horses off
0	child of arcesius , by far the dearest of all those i cherish ,
0	from a hollow ship and reach that cavern
0	there 's hope you will have relief from trouble
0	that was the scar the old woman was then holding in her hands
0	meanwhile , peleus ' son , gripping his long-shadowed spear , still eager to kill more , charged asteropaeus , son of pelegon , born to the broad river axius and acessamenus ' eldest daughter , periboea
0	there fell into my heart
0	no blows from sharp bronze spears or other wounds from fighting hand-to-hand , the sort one gets so frequently in battle
0	he was easing his spiritwith a tuneful finely decorated lyre
0	but we must seek this delight , not in appearances , but behind them
0	on the fourth day ,
0	there will be trouble in your home—arrogant men eating up your livelihood and wooing
0	on our right hand , zeus hurled down lightning bolts , signs manifesting his good will to us
0	for fine spearman menelaus , son of atreus , caught him as he ran away in front of him , hitting him in the back between his shoulder blades , forcing the spear right through scamandrius ' chest
0	to odysseus ' home , son of laertes
0	men can grieve too much
0	that 's why i have come
0	from the back , he looked exactly like machaon , son of asclepius
0	fifty-two hand-picked young men
0	calypso gave me with my constant tears
0	for in my heart and mind i know too well
0	euryalus must apologize in person
0	then began to speak to them :
0	to one another , that how these spirits squawked
0	did hector never sacrifice to you , burning thighs of perfect bulls and goats ?
0	not long ago , when our achaean shipsgathered at aulis , bringing disasterfor priam and his trojans , we sacrificed on holy altars placed around a spring hundreds of perfect creatures to the gods , the immortals—underneath that tree , a lovely plane tree , where bright water flowed
0	where there was no way to escape
0	not even swift well-balanced ships get through
0	but come , i will keep you free from harm and save you
0	and these same symptoms allow us to infer the same lack at the heart of this culture , the destruction of myth
0	everything which comes to the surface in the apollonian part of greek tragedy , in the dialogue , looks simple , translucent , and beautiful
0	his words had wings :
0	but i carried the dog off
0	i will suspend the fighting for the length of time you have asked for
0	should one of you meet his fate and die , stabbed by a spear or cut down with a sword , let the man die
0	who 's been absent for so long
0	huge tawny beasts , both well fed on grass ,
0	zeus-fostered king , we will indeed tell him
0	from his dear native land , not even if
0	to keep going on his trip , he stayed there ,
0	i tell you , he wo not go back without you
0	hector drove his fine-maned horses back and forth , his eyes glaring like a gorgon or man-killing ares
0	never since aristotle has an explanation of the tragic effect been offered from which aesthetic states or an aesthetic activity of the listener could be inferred
0	and , sitting well in order , raised their oars
0	struck hard against the ground
0	like a gust of wind , athena slipped over to the young girl 's bed ,
0	with bushy horsehair plumes
0	from my father in this way ?
0	for you wo not be competing as a boxer , or in wrestling , or the spear throw
0	you are plotting mischief now , inviting me to go up to your room ,
0	but other gods had gathered
0	to see which men would risk their lives with me—
0	but he never did return to his own country
0	lycian leaders are pressing us so hard , the ones who previously in bloody fightshave demonstrated their ferocity
0	alas , what a useless promise i made then , the day i tried to cheer menoetius upat home , telling him when i would sacked ilion , i would bring his splendid son back there to him , in opoeis , and with his share of trophies
0	first cloud-gatherer zeus fathered dardanus , who built dardania , for sacred ilion , city of mortal men , was not yet builthere in the plain
0	his huge and pleasant livelihood
0	but come , first let your sure-footed horsescharge at ares
0	but hermes the helper came up by himself , took the old man 's hand , then asked him questions :
0	tragedy absorbs the highest ecstasies of music , so that it truly brings music , both among the greeks and among us , to its perfection ; but then it places the tragic myth and the tragic hero next to it , and he , like a powerful titan , takes the whole dionysian world upon his back and thus relieves us of this burden
0	so he went to hector , stood by him , and said :
0	if you are indeed a god and have listened to that goddess when she speaks ,
0	but surely it 's already clear by now
0	the next man to charge against him was harpalion , son of king pylamenes , who came to fight at troy following his dear father
0	there i saw argive helen ,
0	i noticed the tunic on his body—
0	i lack all this , though personally for me
0	and tell me of my father and my son ,
0	shrewd telemachus then answered him and said :
0	middle-class mediocrity , on which euripides built all his political hopes , now came into prominence
0	then , with his great cunning , he told his wife to place before the suitors
0	it struck menelaus ' shield , a perfect circle , but the bronze did not break through , the point deflected by the powerful shield
0	woman takes a thousand steps to get her way
0	swift achilles was still pressing hector hard in that relentless chase
0	at offering advice and making speeches
0	once they climbed out of that well-built rowing ship onto dry land , first they took odysseus out ,
0	and suffered much gets pleasure from his woes
0	give you , stranger , the thing you most desire ,
0	that staunch perseverance which characterized , for example , the national instincts of the romans , probably does not belong among the necessary predicates of perfection
0	trojans hearts were seized with grief
0	in the river pools , eels and fish were much distressed—they jumped everywhere in that fine river , suffering the fiery blasts prepared by that resourceful god hephaestus
0	she spoke out and said :
0	i want the people safe , not all killed off
0	in a forest clearing they found circe 's house—
0	i am alone , so bring some help
0	moving up close to the dead body , he spoke out , addressing warlike menelaus :
0	across the restless sea
0	in his own house
0	calling to his father , who was close by :
0	inside the palace of splendid menelaus
0	and made a quick prayer to great zeus ' daughter :
0	aphareus ' head snapped back—his shield and helmet fell down on him , and death , which takes the living spirit , gathered him in
0	for athena planned the battle out in just that way
0	for that man was no prophet calchas , who reads our omens
0	i heard the lowing cattle being penned
0	my friend , that is precisely the poet 's work—
0	come now , tell me—and be sure to speak the truth
0	bear his fame far and wide among all men ,
0	there , in the large shrine , leto and artemis , the archer goddess , healed aeneas , restoring him to his former power and magnificence
0	i will tell you i have not been pent up here with my consent
0	steep mountain peaks and by the river springs
0	burial ; amphimedon complains to agamemnon about his death at odysseus ' hands ; agamemnon pays tribute to odysseus and penelope ; odysseus goes out to find his father ; laertes and odysseus talk in the vineyard , and odysseus tests his father with a false story and then reveals his identity ; the two men return to laertes house , where eumaeus , philoetius , and telemachus have prepared dinner ; laertes ' appearance is transformed ; dolius and his sons arrive ; the men in ithaca hear about the slaughter and collect their dead ; eupeithes urges action against odysseus ; medon and halitherses advises against such action ; the majority decide to follow eupeithes ; athena questions zeus about his intentions regarding odysseus ; zeus tells her to deal with the situation ; odysseus and his followers arm themselves and go out to meet the ithacan army ; athena urges laertes to throw a spear ; laertes kills eupeithes ; athena stops the ithacan army and sends it back to the city ; a thunderbolt from zeus stops odysseus ; athena establishes a lasting oath between both sides ]
0	to hear from the massive towering oak tree ,
0	for twelve days he 's lain there , but his fleshhas not decayed
0	powerful diomedes then answered odysseus :
0	apple upon apple , grapes in cluster after cluster , and fig after fig
0	to organize my escort and give splendid gifts ,
0	to tell her she should end her tears and sorrow
0	menelaus , so good at battle shouts ,
0	poseidon would strike her and then throw up
0	the brave epeians were encircling the city , hearts set on razing it
0	he smiled , then said , as he spoke to the argives :
0	loved , and fed me
0	and do not , in your miserable state ,
0	thinking how to kill the suitors with athena 's help
0	his words spurred on the swineherd
0	and moved up to the foredeck of the ship ,
0	with a scowl , hector of the flashing helmet then replied :
0	seeing them coming , sthenelus , capaneus ' brave son , at once spoke up to diomedes—his words had wings
0	she stood by odysseus ' broad-beamed black ship in the middle of the line , so she could be heard in both directions , from the huts of ajax , son of telamon , to those of achilles , whose well-balanced ships were drawn up at the ends , for these men trusted courage and their own strong hands
0	some distance from the path , in case someone came by , before odysseus could wake up , stumbled on them , and robbed him
0	but he went off to argos , where horses graze ,
0	i sent out scouts to go up to the lookouts
0	but you , son of atreus , check your anger
0	why should you be so concerned about it ?
0	in a rich house , too , among my people
0	myth , the necessary prerequisite of any religion , is already paralyzed everywhere , and even in this domain the optimistic spirit , which we have just designated as the germ of destruction in our society , has attained the mastery
0	you will find zeus-fostered kings in there feasting
0	the cattle herder answered him :
0	while you were somewhere far away
0	i cherished and looked after , and i said
0	my kinsmen , the ones a man relies on
0	and there were many in the room
0	i am not surehe 's not a god
0	just as four stallions yoked together charge ahead across the plain , all running underneath the lash , and jump high as they gallop quickly on their way ,
0	after he would said this , her words could find no wings
0	they skillfully bound up
0	but he looks broaderin his shoulders and his chest
0	rubbed him with oil , and put a tunic on him ,
0	then wind-swift iris came to troy as messenger from aegis-bearing zeus carrying grim news
0	in honour of his noble son and daughter
0	while he 's still alive and sees the sunlight , he lives in sorrow
0	to frustrate hearts in our achaean chests
0	hoisted the white sail , and then set off ,
0	but dreadful pain came in my heartand spirit when that man wished to cheatsomeone his equal and steal away that prize , and just because he 's got more power
0	as he threw , trojans moved back , but the spear found a mark
0	but for all that , i urge my lycian troops to action , i stand and fight all comers on my own , when i have nothing for the enemy to take
0	from the way his body looks he 's no weakling—not in his thighs and calves ,
0	to escape the wrath of zeus , not unless
0	called her into the storage room , then said :
0	we dragged it out into the glittering sea ,
0	friends , this man 's hands have been invincible , but now they will stop
0	i will tell you what fate has in store for you
0	to set foot on the shore
0	and spread out lovely purple blankets over them ,
0	let me remain forever in your city , since it seems i will not be going hometo cheer up my dear wife and infant son
0	you got here on foot faster than i did , sailing my black ship
0	or in response to what some god has said ,
0	i will be as tough as a hard stone or iron
0	you understand what sort of spirit lies
0	with respect to this practical pessimism , socrates is the original picture of the theoretical optimist , who in the belief ( which i have described ) that we could discover the nature of things conferred upon knowing and discovering the power of a universal medicine and understood evil-in-itself as error
0	even a fool can see that father zeusis now personally helping trojans
0	i went to circe ,
0	to demodocus , so that he can eat
0	be brave , and do not weigh down your heart with this
0	you want me now to go to battle
0	but they fill up our house day after day ,
0	and then your heart , divinely raised menelaus , had no desire to help defend the hard-pressed comrades left there by antilochus , men of pylos , who felt his loss severely
0	when they would had their fill of food and drink , beautiful divine calypso
0	that 's what she said
0	old man , in this fightthese young men are pressing you too hard
0	i will tell you this—
0	snow melts away under west wind 's thaw ,
0	the subjective mood , the emotional state of the will , communicates with the surroundings we contemplate , and the latter , in turn , gives its colour to our mood , in a reflex action
0	but i was left heart-sick
0	each one with harsh opinions of the other ,
0	for i have never clapped eyes on you beforein those fights where men win glory
0	let 's go back to our own dear country in our ships
0	my cloak behind with my companions
0	and , sitting in good order in their rows ,
0	now once again you gods are envious ,
0	hector of the flashing helmet made no reply
0	and run my hand along his chest , to find
0	achilles carved , while automedon held the meat
0	so come on now ,
0	but you should go up to your own chamber
0	and alcinous , the king
0	rushed up to clasp telemachus ' knees , and begged—
0	his spirit went to hades
0	when the others reached the huts of nestor , neleus ' son , they stepped out on the fertile earth
0	inside my hollow ship , so as to stop
0	looking on , athena and hera teased zeus , son of cronos :
0	thought of something else
0	as for scylla , the father of gods and men
0	after all , one should not demand of what is noblest of all that it should have the durable toughness of leather
0	the broad flowing river could not slow him down , once athena had put great power in achilles
0	then old warrior echeneus addressed them all—
0	are willing , the ones who hold wide heaven ,
0	but they all laughed ,
0	felt strong once again
0	his horses , frightened by their master 's threat , ran faster for a stretch
0	achilles charged offin pursuit , chasing apollo out across the plain , past wheat fields , turning him towards the river , the deep , swirling scamander
0	and drunk wine to their heart 's content , odysseus , a crafty man who had a trick in mind , spoke out :
0	as it pushed a massive wave
0	father zeus , if , among the deathless gods , i have ever served you well in word or deed , then grant my prayer will be fulfilled
0	herald , why have these noble suitors
0	now you are madly eagerto throw deadly fire on our sea-going ships , to kill achaean warriors
0	then she organized her plans
0	then there 's no fear you will suffer anything
0	on my own strength to guard me from a man
0	makes them supremely arrogant
0	in your own home
0	once you have takenhector 's life , return back to the ships
0	and the voyage which i have talked about
0	while the critic got the upper hand in the theater and concert hall , the journalist in the schools , and the press in society , art degenerated into a particularly lowly topic of conversation , and aesthetic criticism was used as a means of uniting a vain , distracted , selfish , and moreover piteously unoriginal sociability whose character is suggested by schopenhauer 's parable of the porcupines
0	let us recollect further that kant and schopenhauer made it possible for the spirit of german philosophy , streaming from similar sources , to destroy scientific socratism 's complacent delight in existence by establishing its boundaries ; how through this delimitation was introduced an infinitely profounder and more serious view of ethical problems and of art , which we may designate as dionysian wisdom comprised in concepts
0	all the splendid gifts phaeacian noblemen
0	he looked like this—he had rounded shoulders ,
0	stranger , you are a fool , or else you have come
0	and hide these goods phaeacian noblemen
0	just as a sharp spasm seizes women giving birth , a piercing labour pain sent by the eilithyiae , hera 's daughters , who control keen pangs of childbirth , that 's how sharp pain sapped agamemnon 's fighting strength
0	in the front hall she found cups and tables left by those who had been feasting there ,
0	the far shooter tricked him , by standing right before achilles ' feet , looking exactly like agenor
0	right then war-loving achaeans would have driven trojansback to ilion , conquered by their own cowardice , with argives winning glory beyond what zeus decreed , through their own strong power
0	and women servants piled some baskets full of bread , while young lads filled their bowls up to the brim with drink
0	would have been too horrible to bear ,
0	when they had lashed the rigging on that fast black ship , they set out bowls brimful of wine and poured libations to the eternal ageless gods , and of them all
0	this anchorage here belongs to phorcys ,
0	all blamed the son of cronos , lord of the dark cloud , because he planned to give glory to the trojans
0	may turn out for the best
0	none of my ships was harmed , no one got sick
0	the animal 's head above the much-travelled earth
0	on a black merchant ship with twenty oars ,
0	most dread son of cronos , what are you saying ?
0	come , stand by great ajax , son of telamon !
0	so then i answered her :
0	i have already made a solemn promise
0	fierce ares has scattered their dark bloodbeside the fair-flowing scamander river
0	thus for the mortal eye the inextricably tangled legal knot of the oedipus story is slowly untangled , and the most profound human joy suffuses us with this divine dialectical companion piece
0	so much bread and meat , they were keen to get some rest
0	until the gods delivered me from trouble
0	one always held the reins—he was the driver
0	from what she has in store
0	nestor , chromius , noble periclymenus ,
0	consult the shade of that theban prophet ,
0	and poplar , too , with long-winged birds nesting there—
0	so quick-eyed achaeans are sending chryseis in fast ships back to chryse , transporting gifts for lord apollo , and heralds cameto take away briseis from my huts , the girl who is my gift from achaea 's sons
0	he had a son , glaucus , father of handsome bellerophon
0	i will bring you each a wife , and i will provide
0	are you on business ?
0	it drove clean through his chest
0	but now the man who has a claim to be the greatest of achaeans has witnessed it
0	when he would eaten and the godlike singer finished , the suitors were making an uproar in the room
0	and was visible to no one but odysseus
0	have you not reached ithaca , nor seen your wife in your own home ?
0	i will go to ithaca and urge his son
0	menelaus had in mind
0	and went off to explore
0	so now let everyoneturn round and face the enemy directly , whether to survive or die
0	old godlike priam then said in answer to achilles :
0	telemachus with the swineherd and goat keeper
0	in this way the gods justify the lives of men because they themselves live it—that is the only satisfactory theodicy !
0	but now this music becomes perceptible to him once again , as in a metaphorical dream image , under the influence of apollonian dreaming
0	in my heart and craving my dear husband ,
0	relying on this noble deception , it may now move its limbs in dithyrambic dances and yield unhesitatingly to an ecstatic feeling of freedom in which it could not dare to wallow as pure music without this deception
0	people sayyou are noble peleus ' son , your motherfair-haired thetis , daughter of the sea
0	they quickly set the urn down in a shallow grave , covered it with large stones set close together , then hurried to pile up the mound , posting sentries on every side , in case well-armed achaeans attacked too soon
0	so deep , courageous , and spiritual , so exuberantly good and tender did this chorale of luther sound -- as the first dionysian luring call breaking forth from dense thickets at the approach of spring
0	patroclus , you thought you would raze our city , robbing our women of their life of freedom , taking them in ships to your dear native land
0	it hit aeneas ' hip , where thigh meets pelvis , what people call the hip joint
0	child of zeus , if you give the order ,
0	one needs to live—things i will remember ,
0	i saw , while sitting on the well-decked ship—
0	for nine days immortals have been quarrelingabout achilles , sacker of cities , and hector 's corpse
0	i will tell you the truth of what you have asked me
0	i will add a gold half-talent to your prize
0	his food and drink , once his legs grow weary
0	keen to reach me
0	of what fate had in store
0	his gold did not spare him a wretched death
0	for how could we compel nature to yield up its secrets , if not for the fact that we fight back against her and win , that is , if not for the fact that we commit unnatural actions ?
0	the farmyard and the pigs in countless numbers ,
0	in a huge rage , he sent down gold-winged iris with a message for them
0	so he prepared to go outside
0	there , once he would washed his hands in gray salt water , to athena he made this prayer :
0	moving up close to patroclus , achilles said :
0	peleus ' son held the shield away from him in his big fist , fearing the long-shadowed spear from brave aeneas would easily go through
0	or were you alone with sheep or cattle ?
0	if nobody is hurting you and you are alone , it must be sickness given by great zeus ,
0	his legal children from his lawful wife
0	in that , too , there is an art , as in certain romance novels of the present time
0	earth flowed black with blood
0	something clear so i can be quite certain
0	while iphitus was enquiring
0	or did you come on other people 's ship
0	to some bath attendant or another slave
0	up to this point , we have considered the apollonian and its opposite , the dionysian , as artistic forces which break forth out of nature itself , without the mediation of the human artist and in which the human artistic drive is for the time being satisfied directly—on the one hand as world of dream images , whose perfection has no connection with an individual 's high level of intellect or artistic education , on the other hand , as the intoxicating reality , which once again does not respect the individual , but even seeks to abolish the individual and to restore him through a mystic feeling of collective unity
0	now all those bodies
0	i ran away through all of spacious hellas , then came a suppliant to fertile phthia , where flocks are bred , to king peleus
0	in all they went through over there , the things
0	he quickly climbed up on one of the horses
0	aphrodite spoke , then loosened from her breasts the finely decorated , embroidered garment in which all her magic charms were fixed—for love , erotic lust , flirtation , and seduction , which steals the wits even of clear-thinking men
0	my weaving would be wasted and in vain
0	some god was guiding us
0	he went on the run through achaean huts and ships
0	around the fields looking for laertes
0	he sat beside the steering oar and used his skill to steer the raft
0	if you linger by the cliff to arm yourself , i fear she will jump out once more , attack you with all her heads and snatch away six men , just as before
0	although you have truly suffered much bad luck
0	here 's a man who will get one for us
0	while sleep , who relaxes troubled human hearts ,
0	taking out another arrow , teucer tried to hit bronze-armed hector
0	thus that old man , skilled in war 's traditions , roused his men
0	i myself am young—
0	into a lovely harbour , with a sheer cliff
0	and had a sumptuous feast
0	a splendid golden belt around her waist
0	zeus has given me a glimpse of land ,
0	great telamonian ajax then answered him :
0	he might see me , as i moved off from the city for the plain , and catch me with a sprint of his swift feet
0	son of atreus , why ask me that question ?
0	one had to destroy tragedy , too , in order to be able to live away from the soil of home , uninhibited , in the wilderness of thought , custom , and deed
0	the people came as soon as dawn appeared—
0	i claim to come from sidon , rich in bronze
0	the rock he planted right in his doorway
0	famine never comes there ,
0	peisenor , a herald who provided shrewd advice ,
0	antinous , son of eupeithes , spoke up :
0	so we can dislodge him from the threshold ,
0	you have undertaken will be pointless
0	the belly of the sail filled up with wind , and the ship sailed on its way
0	they may say nice things , but they are making plans for nasty schemes in future
0	a threat for which there was no remedy—
0	does not match your looks—you would refuse to give
0	so hermes traveled with him , bringing willing favours
0	just like that star which stands out the loveliest among all those in the heavenly night sky—the star of evening—
0	bring your ship back to your dear native land in secret ,
0	you are still ignorant , it seems , of the fact that i am a god
0	i think i loved those things because a god
0	the fame of this wall will reach everywhere , as far as light of dawn
0	just as a mountain falcon , the fastest creature of all the ones which fly , swoops down easily on a trembling pigeon as it darts off in fear , the hawk speeding after it with piercing cries , heart driving it to seize the prey—in just that way achilles in his fury raced ahead
0	but if achillesdoes not learn this from a god who speaks to him , then he may be fearful if some god appearsagainst him in the battle
0	even for a blessed god—that 's how skillfully
0	and was carried off by dreadful winds
0	in this shape , divine aphrodite spoke to helen :
0	men looked and were astounded
0	she used to stroll along
0	but he refused , continuing to mourn :
0	he dumped swift arrows right there at his feet and then addressed the suitors :
0	teucer slaughtered lord aretaon , and antilochus , nestor ’ s son , with his glittering spear killed ableros
0	to set a bed outside , under the portico ,
0	there 's a huge fig tree there with leaves in bloom
0	nor was i coward
0	you are abusive to odysseus ' slaves ,
0	as we talked together , some women came ,
0	when we would sailed past crete , we saw land no more , only sky and sea
0	you would not think he 's just come from some fight
0	as my master ordered , and get there today—
0	as he saw them approach , achilles felt no joy
0	in ocean 's backward-flowing stream , just as
0	we checked out the rigging on our ship and then sat down
0	then zeus , son of cronos , stole glaucus ' wits , for he gave tydeus ' son his golden armour , worth one hundred oxen , exchanging that for armour made of bronze , worth only nine
0	so ajax finished with his mouth and nostrils full of dung , as resilient odysseus raced on ahead , came in first , and won the prize
0	just when i would lost hope , and i have made my way
0	offered up with love—in honour of our guest
0	aeneas , counselor to bronze-armed trojans ,
0	old man , tell me about your troubles
0	with his body wrapped in wretched clothing
0	so she does not mar her lovely face with tears
0	that 's how the wolves and sharp-clawed lions there kept fawning round those men , who were afraid
0	you have returned from wandering around
0	after he would given countless courtship gifts
0	is it not sufficient that in days past ,
0	to my native land
0	iasus , a commander of athenians , was known as a son of sphelus , son of bucolus
0	calypso , the lovely goddess , went back home
0	through all its days it 's never once been sown
0	after all , they bring you presents , many pleasing gifts , to helice and aegae
0	this man here has saved your life
0	and in a raft—a harsh and dangerous trip
0	but then achilles met someone fleeing the river— lycaon , a son of dardanian priam , whom he would captured once before in a night attack , taking him against his will from his father 's orchard
0	he nodded at the woman ,
0	those serving at the meal laid down a portion of the meat in front of him
0	and has requested confirmation from us
0	but these things are in the lap of the gods
0	if somehow my crewmen and myself
0	they carved the body quickly , cutting thigh bones out , all in proper order , and then covered them
0	then he stripped their armour
0	that in years past you have been kind to me ,
0	he would never been among achaean ships—
0	with you an only son and so well loved ?
0	whenever battles start , i stand and fightwith men in front , in those encounters where men win glory
0	that tribute made , they drank wine to their heart 's content
0	and godlike eurylochus led the other
0	danaans then began to push the trojans back
0	in a fine cloak and tunic and led me
0	that was how i started
0	my comrades cautioned me from every side ,
0	too much hospitality or not enough
0	will come into the home of odysseus ,
0	i brought her up and gave her to peleusto be his wife , a man dear to the heartsof the immortal gods
0	i will stir up some winds—
0	for in this way he will be able to determine to what extent he is capable of understanding myth as a concentrated image of the world that , as a condensation of phenomena , can not dispense with miracles
0	in his heart achilles sensed their purpose
0	once they would rowed on well beyond the sirens ,
0	but pallas athena grabbed it and returned it to achilles , without hector , that shepherd of his people , seeing what she would done
0	and move inside the finely furnished house
0	why is that mighty god now summoning me ?
0	as far as i know , thoas , no one 's to blame
0	for meyou got the value of a hundred oxen ,
0	it depends far more on those great rhetorical-lyrical scenes in which the passion and dialectic of the main hero swelled up into a wide and powerful storm
0	for all their numbers , they could not hold their ground outside the city walls
0	i know well that in my master 's journey home
0	patroclus had owned nine dogs who ate beside his table
0	but we have got hands to raise in their defense
0	she came up to she gave the same instructions ,
0	then meriones , the fifth contestant in the race , harnessed his fine-maned horses , and all the racers climbed in their chariots
0	as when young men and hunting dogs harass a boar , the beast charges from dense foliage on every side , whetting white teeth on its curving jaws , and they dodge all round it , to the sound of champing tusks , hunters and dogs standing firm , for all their fear—
0	the others kept on fighting
0	three times apollo pushed back his shining shield
0	sleep in your soft bed
0	back through the house , until they reached telemachus
0	she led me in
0	wise eurycleia then answered him :
0	there are countless crops and wine-bearing grapes
0	she saw her father standing in his chariot , together with his herald , the town crier
0	right now i am always grieving for the boy ,
0	we will leave him behind
0	and to the influence of this outrage we can ascribe the fact that the view of greek antiquity as a time of rose-coloured serenity lasted for centuries with almost invincible tenacity , as if greek antiquity had never produced a sixth century , with its birth of tragedy , its mystery cults , its pythagoras and heraclitus , indeed , as if the artistic works of the great age simply did not exist—although these works , each and every one of them , can not be explained at all on the grounds of such a senile joy in existence and serenity , moods appropriate to a slave , or of things which testify to a completely different world view as the basis of their existence
0	before i could do that , she slaughtered me , her husband
0	there were young lads dancing , whirling to the constant tunes of flutes and lyres , while all the women stood beside their doors , staring in admiration
0	achilles , son of peleus , mightiest
0	you mean laertes ' son , from ithaca
0	he would look out , through his tears , over the restless sea
0	i was badly beaten down—on board ship
0	and for her husband 's bed , or to go now
0	out in the open courtyard
0	till that time , you will lie like this with me by my beaked ships , and round you trojan and dardanian womenwill keep lamenting night and day , shedding tears , the very women we two worked hard to winwith our strength and our long spears , by lootingprosperous cities of mortal men
0	then they fell asleep
0	odysseus did not plan these acts
0	with prayers and vows
0	they lay together there covered with a cloud , a lovely golden mist , from which fell glistening dew
0	into my house and entertained him well , with a kind welcome , using the rich store
0	ca not each of them go roundwaking up the kings ?
0	to your own children , so that something bad
0	some time in the night , long-haired achaeans may make their move to get away by sea
0	his heart was hatching trouble for the suitors
0	would anyone have acted otherwise ,
0	instilled fresh spirit in them all
0	but hectorcharged on from where he ’ d first breached the gates and wall , smashing up the close-packed ranks of the danaans , right to the ships of protesilaus and ajax , drawn up on the beach beside the blue-gray sea
0	as it came out , i struck it in the spine ,
0	then some other man stood here
0	i do not go to the city , unless i am called
0	to be given to me
0	i am still too young and can not yet rely
0	unless philoetius has killed him ,
0	brandishing his spear , powerful diomedes yelled :
0	these things concern your heart
0	around his legs he would tied shin pads stitched from ox-hide to protect himself from scratches , and on his hands he had on gloves , since there were thistles in that spot
0	he took the form of phaenops , son of asius , of all hector 's guests the one he liked the most
0	instantly prepared to listen :
0	but when they came within the distance of a spear throw or even less , he saw that they were enemies and started running , to get away as quickly as his legs could carry him
0	there was no moon
0	trojans , in full retreat , passed the wall and ditch , with many slaughtered by danaans
0	but if a man is innocent and thinks
0	but when zeus , son of cronos , brought to us
0	he did not try to tell me any details
0	grant that i see the day of my return
0	but it is just as certain that in those places where the first onslaught was halted , the high reputation and the majesty of the delphic god manifested itself more firmly and threateningly than ever
0	or when he turns again from heaven to earth
0	would you were safely by your ships dry-eyed
0	unraveling on the straps—the two men jumped out
0	before he can quickly get to pylos
0	his eyes saw me and knew just who i was
0	so come on , climb up into my chariot
0	hera 's entreaties have persuaded them
0	silver-footed thetis then said in reply :
0	what my eyes witness here astounds me , a dreadful thing i never thought would happen— trojans moving up to our own ships , men who previously were shy , like deer , which in the woods are prey to jackals , wolves , and leopards , as they wander round , alone and frightened , with no will to fight
0	once they had all eaten their fill of food and drink , geranian horseman nestor was the first to speak
0	to come here , so i can greet him warmly
0	that is how the delphic god interpreted the greek past
0	warlike podarces , son of iphicles , led them— the man owned many flocks and was a young blood brotherto protesilaus
0	let me tell you something which is sure to happen—if you slack off nowand i win some inferior prize , then nestor , his people 's shepherd , will stop feeding you
0	when he said this , laertes felt great joy and said :
0	half way up the rock face there 's a shadowy cave
0	but that was now impossible
0	when atreus ' son menelaus , skilled at war shouts , threw his spear , he hit helenus in the hand , the one which held the finely polished bow
0	and added many tasty delicacies as well ,
0	but , i tell you , he 's not yet escaped being killed
0	playing checkers right outside the door , sitting down on hides of cattle they themselves had butchered
0	all men need the gods
0	the cyclopes do not have boats with scarlet prows or men with skills to build them well-decked ships , which would enable them to carry out
0	but every man he looked at—
0	myself , i would rather leave you at the farm
0	these carcasses they skinned and dressed and then prepared a splendid banquet
0	and athena also came , ready to receive the sacrifice
0	ships were smashing into one another ,
0	swift-footed achilles then answered agamemnon :
0	the one they have gotwo not work , since anger still keeps me away
0	in your home , unless there is an old one ,
0	it 's dangerous to come to blows with thosemarried to cloud-gatherer zeus
0	his other clutched the spear , refusing to let go
0	hector of the flashing helmet turned his eyes to one side and shook out the lots
0	now , there 's a certain city thryoessa , far off on a steep hill by the alpheius , at the very end of sandy pylos
0	loved in all sorts of ways
0	so now go on your own and challenge him
0	with a double fold , and a fringed tunic ,
0	hear what i have to say
0	whereas in all productive men instinct is the truly creative and affirming power , and consciousness acts as a critical and cautioning reaction , in socrates the instinct becomes the critic , consciousness becomes the creator—truly a monstrous defect
0	he could smear on his bronze arrow points
0	to what then does the mystery of this oneness of german music and philosophy point if not to a new form of existence , concerning whose character we can only inform ourselves by surmise from hellenic analogies ?
0	achilles served the meat
0	should zeus ever grantwe pillage troy , a city rich in goods , we will give you three or four times as much
0	the god-like man climbed in , held back the reins
0	it has soft , well-watered meadows
0	but i will not stop killingthese proud trojans till i have them corneredin their city and have tested hectorin a fight , and he kills me or i kill him
0	the road lies there in front of you
0	and strive for evil , for no one here , none of those whom divine odysseus ruled ,
0	i think i may provoke someone who wields great power over argives , a man who is obeyed by everyone
0	so none of us could recognize the man
0	go now , swift iris , convey to lord poseidon these instructions , report it all precisely—he 's to stop , to leave the battle strife , and go awayto the group of gods or to his sacred sea
0	you know , when he went off
0	the mightiest and most terrible oath
0	father , i think you will later come to recognize
0	with all my family safe
0	it is like the relationship of the entrancing vision of the tortured martyr to his pain
0	the higher truth , the perfection of this condition in contrast to the sketchy understanding of our daily reality , as well as the deep consciousness of a healing and helping nature in sleep and dreaming , is the symbolic analogy to the capacity to prophesy the truth , as well as to art in general , through which life is made possible and worth living
0	you people should disperse , each one
0	the oaken axle groaned aloud , weighed down , bearing the fearful goddess and the finest man
0	and then , menelaus , they would have seen you die at hector 's hands—he was by far the stronger man— if wide-ruling agamemnon , son of atreus , king of the achaeans , had not hurried up , grabbed you by your right hand , and said these words :
0	let people merely recall the consequences of the socratic sayings virtue is knowledge ; sin arises only from ignorance ; the virtuous person is the happy person
0	she placed a well-washed cloak around his body , then made him taller and restored his youthful looks
0	and spoke at once to his phaeacians , master sailors
0	standing upright at the mast
0	mine and the immortals
0	menelaus , skilled at war shouts , followed his advice
0	the breaking waters pushed him backwards
0	thus , you should go
0	get outside , you wretch , and be satisfied
0	he stood holding his clear-toned lyre by the side door , his mind divided—should he slip out from the hall and take a seat close to the altar of great zeus , god of the courtyard , where laertes and odysseus had burned many thighs from sacrificial oxen ,
0	they did not disobey , but dressed themselves in bronze , opened the doors , and went outside , with odysseus in the lead
0	this is now the ninth revolving year we have been waiting here , on this very spot
0	all right , i will say what seems to me the best
0	that 's what nestor said , and the brave achaeans stopped their running
0	the defiant titan prometheus reported to his olympian torturer that for the first time his rule was threatened by the highest danger , unless he quickly joined forces with him
0	there were nine groups , each with five hundred people and nine offerings of bulls ready to sacrifice
0	father , what my eyes are witnessing is an enormous wonder
0	his words had wings :
0	commands respect , even with deathless gods—
0	they left behind them the cities of lemnos and imbros , moving quickly , then came to mount ida with its many springs , mother of wild creatures , and arrived at lectum , where for the first time they left the sea
0	the man she loves
0	to toiling men , each and every one of them ,
0	his head , and his hair on top
0	odysseus ' dear son rushed to put on a bright tunic ,
0	and stood there , on a rugged outcrop ,
0	with both fists on the jaw , smash all his teeth
0	as he dies , she sees him gasping his last breath , embraces him , and screams out her laments ,
0	my excellence in form and body
0	there in the city all were overcome with grief beyond anyone 's control
0	how my heart pities hector , who 's often sacrificed to me , burningmany thighs of oxen on the crestsof ida with its many spurs and valleys , on the city heights , as well
0	prosperity and his knees stay supple
0	once you strike at themit ca not stop flesh-ripping bronze
0	but now , he 's forgotten that and helps the trojans
0	then in his anger he threw the sceptre on the ground and burst out crying
0	the gristle hit the solid wall
0	the best men put on the best equipment , the worst men got the worst
0	he was sitting with the suitors , his heart troubled , picturing in his mind how his noble father
0	let others swear a solemn oath as friends
0	across the restless sea , leaving lovely scheria
0	i do believefather zeus must hate me , to give me to youfor a second time
0	for hector then will speak out in troy
0	a dust cloud rose above him , his dark hair spread out round him , and hector 's head , once so handsome , was covered by the dust , for zeus had given him to his enemies to dishonour in his own native land
0	with goddess aphrodite in the lead , they came to alexander 's lovely house
0	take care to welcome him with honour ,
0	let no one believe that the german spirit has forever lost its mythical home when it can sill understand so plainly the voices of the birds that tell of that home
0	then they , too , lay down in the shadowy hall to sleep
0	i guarantee i would pay you—gathering stones
0	who has had to suffer such misfortune
0	by contrast , the tragic chorus of the greeks is required to recognize the shapes on the stage as living , existing people
0	tied some fine sandals on his feet , took a strong spear , well suited to his grip , and , as he headed off
0	then the whole bunch disappeared , all of them
0	in his hand he held two spears
0	everyone who saw it was astonished
0	were overcome with passionate weeping ,
0	and almost hit the steering oar
0	they both let fly together—one with a sharp spear , the other with an arrow from his bowstring
0	glorious achilles , if your mindis really set on going back , if youare totally unwilling to protectour swift ships from destructive fire , because that anger has consumed your heart , how can i remain here , dear lad , alone , away from you ?
0	he calmed himself , right up to his last days , with the interpretation that his philosophizing was the highest musical art , and believed that it was incorrect that a divinity would remind him of common , popular music
0	i will take my ship and my own company
0	asked me why i would come to lovely sparta ,
0	tended by foreign herdsmen or his own
0	but trojans kept on pouring in
0	and lived alone , away from all the rest , a law unto himself , a monster , made
0	inside your halls , and every man will bring
0	another of achaea 's well-dressed women ,
0	if it now seems as if the lyrical genius and the non-genius bound up with him were one and the same and as if the first spoke that little word i about himself , then this illusion could no longer deceive us , not at least in the way it deceived those who have defined the lyricist as a subjective poet
0	the heart here in my chest gets full of grief ,
0	and so the aristophanic euripides gave himself high praise for how he presented common , well-known , ordinary living and striving , which any person was capable of judging
0	turn them back again
0	so amphinomus addressed them all and said :
0	and now prepare a meal , while we stay put
0	full of water , and a bag of food , in which she put many tasty things for him to eat
0	that was what zeus willed—other gods , as well
0	the heart in mighty ajax recognized gods ' work
0	around malea , driving me past cythera
0	to his high-roofed house and native land
0	paris did not wait for long in his high-roofed home
0	resourceful odysseus then said to telemachus :
0	to set ares free
0	and three rows of teeth packed close together , full of murky death
0	about his comrades who went there with him
0	he dug a trench ,
0	you proud-hearted trojans , do not be afraid of that son of peleus
0	once i would said this ,
0	besides this i place another equally obvious confirmation of my view that opera is based on the same principles as our alexandrian culture
0	a style in which music is regarded as the servant , the text as the master , where music is compared with the body , the text with the soul ?
0	indeed , people would have let themselves be killed in order to learn more from him , if they had not been aware that tragic poets were just as dead as tragedy itself
0	but i ca not see two of the men 's leaders , castor , tamer of horses , and pollux , the fine boxer—they are both my brothers , whom my mother bore along with me
0	i will say this to you—
0	odysseus crawled and immediately gathered up
0	we must recognize how everything which comes into being must be ready for a painful destruction
0	their mother , had gone outside and summoned them
0	i could not catch a glimpse of her at all
0	she would throw up keel and mast
0	well , he won me over with his cunning
0	then antilochuspounced on him , like a dog leaping on a wounded fawn , which some hunter hits as it rushes from its den , loosening its limbs
0	for me to drink
0	but i swam on ,
0	let the one whose heart now drives himto fight with me step out as champion , your representative against lord hector
0	my child , could you direct me to the home
0	raise up your legs , you fine dancers , and better yet , stand on your heads !
0	a cloak and tunic and some clothes to wear
0	on an island , suffering great distress
0	whoever has experienced the delight of a socratic discovery and feels how this , in ever-widening rings , seeks to enclose the entire world of phenomena , will experience no spur capable of pushing him into existence more intense than the desire to complete that conquest and to weave a solid impenetrable net
0	i do not think his strength will help him , or his beauty , or that lovely armour—that will lie somewhere underneath the flood , buried in slime
0	dear brother , save me
0	below the sunlight , as i , too , did once ?
0	when they observed this , the two , in their amazement , went straight up to them
0	at evening the fine swineherd came to odysseus
0	like wild mountain boars taking on a confused mob of men and dogs attacking them—the beasts charge sideways , shattering trees around them , ripping out the roots , gnashing their teeth noisily , till someone hits them with his spear and takes away their lives—that 's how the shining bronze sounded on these two , as they moved out against the flying weapons
0	gods and warriors slept through the entire night
0	there 's an outer rim of jagged boulders
0	i am afraid that one of the phaeacians may outrun me , for in those many waves
0	your heads , your faces ,
0	we prepared and ate our evening meal
0	we made her finish it against her will
0	nor did i need to spend time at your house ,
0	coming up , patroclus struck him with his spear right on the jawbone , smashing through his teeth
0	on my way home
0	to go there and mingle with the suitors—
0	may gods grant you success of every kind ,
0	from dulichium , in fear of eurymachus
0	other gods had received their sacrifices , but he would failed to offer anything to her , a daughter of great zeus
0	achilles , greatly moved by what the gods had said , set off , running across the plain , now full of flooding water , with many lovely weapons of the slaughtered men floating there among their corpses
0	stranger , i speak his name with full respect
0	which both their hearts should find agreeable
0	of many warriors , when , once a king dies ,
0	in this , music is like geometric figures and numbers , which are the universal forms of all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all a priori [ before experience ] , although they are not abstract but vivid and always fixed
0	she was the youngest child of amphion ,
0	and zeus ' will then came to be fulfilled
0	because of something dionysus said
0	the truth is this—blessed gods do not love
0	but idomeneus went away to troy
0	he 's still alive , looking at the sunlight
0	and i do not even hear about his journey
0	it filled the sail , an excellent companion
0	it would be wrong , stranger , for me to disrespect a guest ,
0	then i think you most resemble artemis ,
0	sidonian experts in skilled handicrafts who made it had shaped it well
0	amazement gripped all those observing him to watch him organize those axes properly ,
0	while i was born deformed
0	no matter what his strength
0	will fix your eye
0	swift iris , with feet like wind , then said to achilles :
0	so they came forward one by one in turn ,
0	all the way back to aeolus ' island
0	savory smells curled up amid the smoke high into heaven
0	as phemius said this ,
0	but in his cave the wild cyclops had slaughtered him and made him his final meal
0	should be brave , so people born in future years
0	of his comrades ' bitter fate
0	if we start bickering , we ca not enjoy the meal , our excellent banquet
0	as i kept going , my heart
0	but why should an innocent man like himsuffer such misfortune , without doing wrong , just because of other people 's troubles ?
0	and as for food ,
0	then come to the wandering rocks , dread charybdis , and to scylla , whom men have never yet escaped
0	and giver of good things , how would you like
0	into a shining sky
0	this archilochus immediately startles us , alongside homer , through his cry of hate and scorn , through the drunken eruptions of his desire
0	to censure him for this is as impossible as it is to approve of his influence on the removal of instinct
0	apple trees—all with gleaming fruit—sweet figs
0	the man who wins , who comes off the victor , gets the womanand her property
0	he was all that eager to get married—
0	or hear their voices
0	i will tell you a sure sign you wo not forget—
0	earth flowed with blood
0	as a passenger and not the master
0	do not tell mewhat i should do
0	we do not have many cloaks
0	the old nurse went back to her room to rest ,
0	then , one after another , the proud suitors came
0	he hit hyrtius , the son of gyrtius , who led the courageous mysians
0	with these words , thetis left the cave
0	twelve distinguished kings are rulers here
0	odysseus prepares for his revenge
0	then she went away ,
0	whoever looks at a collection of folk songs , for example , des knaben wunderhorn [ the boy 's miraculous horn ] with this theory in mind will find countless examples of how the continually fecund melody spews out fiery showers of images all around
0	all around the boundless earth
0	on the tenth night ,
0	or inspired minstrels , who sing for our delight ?
0	the chorus of satyrs in the dithyramb is the saving fact of greek art
0	then in his hut he would rest again , leaving hector stretched out , face down in the dust
0	like a ship 's ribs , twelve of them in all
0	though a stranger , all by himself in that cadmean crowd , chariot fighter tydeus was not afraid
0	with these words , hermes went on his way , back to high olympus
0	another 's livelihood and pay him nothing
0	surely wide-thundering zeus for many years has shown a dreadful hate
0	when our will prevails
0	odysseus , that harsh rebuke of yours has stung my heart
0	you are our herald , tell the fair-haired nymph
0	your plan will benefit the two of us
0	got his revenge against his father 's killer ,
0	we know well enough your lovely armouris in trojan hands
0	a splendid meal of meat and sweetened wine
0	because i have gone through so much misery
0	a mist fell , clouding his eyes , but soon he breathed again
0	but there are lots of us who will stand against you
0	against the promontory on the left ,
0	and offers the best bridal gifts
0	coön was feverishly dragging his blood brother , iphidamas , out by the feet , crying for help to all the finest men
0	peiraeus , a famous spearman , then answered him and said :
0	zeus and the other gods kept me tied up
0	by our black ship
0	drink fit for gods and not yet mixed with water—
0	which no man yet has put beneath the yoke
0	if you send sarpedon home alive , take care some other god does not desireto send his dear son from the killing zone
0	now lies dead , something he well deserved
0	while she was alive ,
0	made high-minded polypheides his prophet ,
0	but their laments were useless
0	as she wept , lord odysseus heard her voice and lost himself in thought
0	you keep coming at me with such anger
0	but athena made sure their spear throws missed the mark
0	and yet i had to bear countless troubles ,
0	this is the apollonian dream state , in which the world of day veils itself and a new world , clearer , more comprehensible , more moving than the first , and yet shadow-like generates itself anew in a continuing series of changes before our eyes
0	their ears all caught his call
0	if zeus had not brought on a storm to end it
0	the two men ran up , panting , and grabbed his hands
0	what you have been looking forward to so long
0	to be married and got countless wedding gifts
0	her flesh melted—just as on high mountains
0	many men wished to volunteer
0	let sense of shame from all menfill your hearts
0	to learn about or hear of anything ,
0	these forces struggled , with terrific shouts across the dead man 's corpse
0	a place where i can leave this cold gray sea
0	his heart was angry with his dear mother , althea
0	the sea 's huge depths , in spite of all the gods
0	then someone must set off for the black ship
0	and so the messenger god , killer of argus ,
0	and then wise penelope began their conversation :
0	on his strong head he set a well-made helmet , with a horsehair crest which nodded menacingly
0	i think if we could capture these two things , achaeans would climb aboard their ships tonight
0	the servant women washed him , rubbed him down with oil , and dressed him in a handsome cloak and tunic
0	riding on the misty sea , lay very close to him
0	then you can hear both sirens as they sing
0	once he 's looked them over , he will lie down in their midst , like a shepherd with his sheep
0	and noble echephron led in the heifer by the horns , as aretus entered from an inner room ,
0	has truly been fulfilled !
0	a servant brought in a lovely golden jug ,
0	achilles seized him by the foot , then flung him in the river , shouting out in triumph— his words had wings :
0	or any rule of law , in hollow caves
0	daughter of great zeus who bears the aegis
0	to a sheltered spot , following what nausicaa ,
0	and i saw tityus , son of glorious earth ,
0	you came here wandering across the sea ?
0	its tremendous expansion , extending to all peoples and constantly increasing with new births , testifies to us how strong that artistic duality of nature is : which , to use an analogy , leaves its trace behind in the folk song just as the orgiastic movements of a people leave their traces in its music
0	a useful remedy—she got ambrosia ,
0	odysseus goes to the palace as a beggar
0	with these words , helen placed the garment in his hands
0	sweet slumber did not enfold this shepherd of his people , for his mind was disturbed with many worries
0	where lambs are born with horns and ewes give birth three times in one full year
0	instead , let each man carry on his courtship
0	now we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the womb of this socratic culture : optimism , with its delusion of limitless power
0	you are fighting against the trojans by yourself , in the front ranks of the crowd
0	that 's what she said
0	and die a pitiful death
0	when evening comes , i could wash in the river , get rid of all the sweat and then go back , return to ilion
0	he made me swear
0	helen , child of zeus , then answered priam :
0	son of atreus , other achaean leaders , priam and other noble trojans asked meto tell you what alexander has proposed , if that meets with your approval , an offeryou will want to hear
0	but those sailors ' hearts
0	the best wine you have got after the stock
0	the philosophy of wild and naked nature looks with the unconcealed countenance of truth at the myths of the homeric world dancing past it
0	the lovely goddess answered right away :
0	hera then fixed earrings in her pierced ear lobes , each with three gemstones , an enchanting glitter
0	in ancient wisdom , had not held them back
0	on his head odysseus set a hide cap , on the inside skillfully reinforced with leather thongs
0	i have got such a wretched fate !
0	but as it is , your fate was to be caught
0	hence , pressed down under this weight of contempt and eternal no 's , life must finally be experienced as something not worth desiring , as something worthless
0	of all men you are the best in making plans
0	and gave the argives wise and useful views
0	in the courtyard , old horseman peleus was burning thigh bones rolled in fat to thunder-loving zeus
0	then , as they were about to sprint in for the prize , ajax slipped in mid stride—for athena fouled him— right where the bellowing cattle had dropped their dung as they were slaughtered , the ones which swift achilles had killed in honour of patroclus
0	mighty agamemnon answered menelaus :
0	that 's the one whose daughter prevents the sad , unlucky man from leaving
0	from the beast 's head he cut off a single hair
0	for i have this cruel wound
0	she sent me off
0	each of them shouted out some words like these
0	a single beam of pine kept the gate securely closed
0	giving such a speech
0	we need to fight
0	worn down by sad old age , he would have no other child , no person to inherit all his property
0	paris led the second group , along with agenor and alcathous
0	dragged them underneath the rowing benches ,
0	you should consider what that means
0	at the home of wise ortilochus
0	only to the extent that the genius in the act of artistic creation is fused with that primordial artist of the world , does he know anything about the eternal nature of art , in that state , miraculously , as in the weird picture of fairy tales , he can turn his eyes and contemplate himself
0	so now , i end my anger
0	just as ravenous mountain wolves suddenly attackyoung goats or lambs and seize them from the flock , when in the mountains an inattentive shepherdlets them wander off—once the wolves see them , they attack at once , for those young lack the heart to fight— that 's how danaans then went after trojans , whose minds now turned to shameful flight , for they would lost their will to battle on
0	in the twentieth year , after going through
0	they would all come to a speedy end and find
0	then this man should soon take his final shot
0	they hauled in and furled the sails on their trim ship , moored it , and disembarked
0	i guarantee he will get a fine reward
0	companions and ships equipped with oars ,
0	by father zeus , athena , and apollo , i wish i were
0	inside the splendid chariot , and nestor 's son
0	send your companions and the ship ahead ,
0	odysseus quickly put on a cloak and tunic ,
0	even something small , is to be cherished
0	who would have welcomed me , then sent me off
0	let us add its most difficult question : what , from the point of view of living , does morality mean ?
0	the men said this in tears , addressing the king with tender words
0	stands the long-leafed olive tree
0	come , let 's go in your chariot , or at leastclasp him by the knees and beg for mercy
0	pale fear gripped my crewmen
0	the fine gate to the yard is awfully near ,
0	or eurytus of oechalia , warriors
0	in this drama there is already a surrender of individuality by entering into a strange nature
0	my lightning would have blasted both of you
0	how i am escorted from this place
0	he fell down on his knees , screaming
0	a younger man could talk so much like him
0	i wish i were as young as i was then ,
0	for they all hated paris , as they hated gloomy death
0	going out , eumelus ' mares were in the lead , but they must have run into some troubleout there , somewhere on the plain
0	so he jumped up and looked out at his native land
0	beside their dear father and good mother ,
0	the river bore orsilochus , king of many men , and orsilochus fathered great-hearted diocles , to whom were born twin sons ,
0	swift-footed orsilochus—in spacious crete
0	when all his armour was in place around his body , he moved forward , like some gigantic ares when he sets off to battle among warriors whom zeus , son of cronos , has stirred up for war , to fight with that war frenzy which consumes men 's hearts
0	the two of uscould run as quickly as the west wind 's blasts—men say they are the fastest thing there is—your fate still stays the same , to die in war , killed by a mortal and a god
0	i stayed there seven years and gathered up
0	the son of atreus shouted to his argives to get their armour on
0	there will be sorrow for you later ,
0	the middle of its back
0	but some remained— both sons of atreus , lord odysseus , nestor , idomeneus , and old horseman phoenix , each trying to console him in his painful grieving
0	her fine daughter , the youngest child she bore
0	white-armed goddess hera saw argives being slaughtered in the thick of battle
0	and that i wanted to avoid
0	the dogs and herdsmen
0	over the sea in their swift ship , set him
0	however , insofar as he interprets music in images , he is resting in the still tranquility of the sea of apollonian observation , no matter how much everything which he contemplates through that medium of music is moving around him , pushing and driving
0	the son of cronos has forbidden anyoneto assist the argives
0	with these words , glorious hector stretched his hands out for his son
0	but come , i will transform you ,
0	my own dear son fell there , antilochus , as strong as he was noble ,
0	or else i would have perished in these rooms
0	in horse-breeding argos , seeking to seduce
0	in his lofty home with hospitality
0	then brave sthenelusclimbed back into his chariot , grabbed the shining reins , and raced the strong horses back , keen to rejoin diomedes
0	when they joined up with the company of sentries , they did not find the captains of the watchmen sleeping
0	for then i will haveno other comfort , once you meet your death , except my sorrow
0	they present in the clarity of the real the very thing which music expresses in the universality of mere form
0	i will tell you about him
0	then they stopped , regrouping by their chariots , pale with fear , terrified
0	i called you here , each from your own city , not because i wished a large displayor needed it , but so you might help merescue trojan wives and little childrenfrom warrior achaeans
0	so they mourned for hector in his own house , though he was still alive—they thought he would not come back , he would not escape the battle fury of achaean hands
0	for our best men lie injured at the ships , crippled by arrows , spears , and swords
0	as they gazed upon the man , struck with wonder
0	to his heart it seemed she knew him and was standing there ,
0	who loved to go to battle in a chariot
0	in their hearts they must glow with pleasure for you always ,
0	but i could not lead my men off safely ,
0	tamer of horses , berthed their well-built ships
0	two herdsmen followed with him
0	and then to sacred sparta , seeking news
0	the gods had that much special love for you
0	the suitors were unhappy ,
0	and so was he
0	at once he sent an eagle , of all flying things the surest omen , a dark one , which people call black eagle , with wings as wide as doors on some rich man 's vaulted store house , one fitted well with bolts—that 's how wide this eagle spread its wings on either side , appearing on the right , speeding across the city
0	and had her share of recognition from the gods
0	with all these troubles in my heart
0	their master , in great pain ,
0	meriones killed a well-armed trojan warrior , laogonus , daring son of onetor , a priest of zeus at ida , honoured by his people as a god
0	then ino with the lovely ankles noticed him—
0	sends out another to maintain their count
0	child of aegis-bearing zeus , why have you come now ?
0	by force , or did you volunteer to give it up ,
0	old man , everything you say is true enough
0	and once you have had your meal , we will ask you who you are
0	what distinguishes the aryan conception is the lofty view of an active transgression as the essentially promethean virtue
0	he answered me and said :
0	the two men let the sweat dry on their tunics , standing in the seashore breeze
0	but we still must see and bear these things—
0	each of them prayed that he could go to bed with her
0	with ranks of soldiers
0	holding bull 's hide shields up high , with loud shouts , asius ' men came straight for the well-built wall , behind lord asius , iamenus , orestes , adamas , asius ' son , thoön , and oenomaus
0	in it the atrophied form of tragedy lived on , as a monument to tragedy 's extremely laborious and violent death
0	against each other , bring in their cattle ,
0	approaching ajax , the herald dropped the token in his palm
0	hera , why have youcome ?
0	only dare to be tragic men ; for you are to be redeemed
0	and ransacked priam 's city in the tenth
0	they sped off eagerly , dragging hector
0	measuring four acres and containing soil
0	i have been suffering trouble for a long time
0	but if fair-haired menelaus kills alexander , then let the trojans hand back helen , with all her property , and compensateachaeans with something suitable , which future ages will remember
0	but i was afraid you might be angry ,
0	as for me , i am readyto give every gift which lord odysseus promised you in your hut yesterday
0	but when i wish to hide my thoughts from gods , do not you go digging after them , or pestering me for every detail
0	alas—sarpedon , dearest of all men , is fated now to die , killed by patroclus ,
0	that was the song the famous minstrel sang
0	the wonderfully crafted metal rang out loudly
0	and with a sure aim let the arrow fly
0	resentment lingers in his chest , until one dayhe acts on it
0	with those two gods of art , apollo and dionysus , we connect our recognition that in the greek world there exists a huge contrast , in origins and purposes , between visual ( plastic ) arts , the apollonian , and the non-visual art of music , the dionysian
0	then the killer of argus , zeus ' messenger ,
0	by this time , helios had just begun to strike the fields ,
0	and hold it on my shoulder with one hand
0	they lashed the rope ends to the mast as well ,
0	the fawn , as he throttled it , and the fawn
0	will reach my native land
0	but i will make this threat : i will take your prize , fair-cheeked briseis
0	there were no harbours fit for ships to ride or coves , but jutting headlands , rocks , and cliffs—at that point odysseus felt his knees and spirit give way ,
0	carved out of pine
0	when he met her , great-hearted tydeus ' son charged , lunging with his sharp spear at aphrodite
0	then you may enjoy some , too , if you will drink
0	once he grew up and longed for his own land
0	i told him to return back to the ships , once he would saved them from consuming fire , and not face up to hector man to man
0	but now , you should all eat , so we can start the fight
0	that 's no help to us
0	closely observed , this fatal influence of the opera on music is seen to coincide exactly with the universal development of modern music ; the optimism lurking in the genesis of the opera and in the character of the culture thereby represented , has , with alarming rapidity , succeeded in divesting music of its dionysian-cosmic mission and impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character : a change comparable to the metamorphosis of the aeschylean man into the cheerful alexandrian
0	because of this complete transformation in public language he also made the new comedy possible
0	already down in hades ' home ?
0	glaucus , why would a man like you speak outso arrogantly ?
0	i would be ashamed to do it
0	that always happens , each and every day
0	who cares about apollo 's scarf and staff ?
0	whose young have been carried off by country folk before they are fully fledged
0	so medon was the one who set their ranks in order
0	this lofty metaphysical delusion is inherent in scientific research and leads it over and over again to its limits , at which point it must turn itself into art , something which is really predictable in this mechanical process
0	their roosting place , and find out they have been welcomed by a dreadful bed , that 's how those women held their heads all in a row , with nooses fixed around their necks , so they would have a pitiful death
0	in those centuries when the greek body flourished and the greek soul bubbled over with life , perhaps there were endemic raptures , visions , and hallucinations which entire communities , entire cultural bodies , shared
0	under men 's and horses ' feet the earth rang ominously
0	which helios owns , who gives men such joy
0	so i split up
0	in all these things i am telling you the truth
0	you seem to be a vagrant , just like me—
0	ajax , my friend , come here
0	a song about the glorious deeds of warriors ,
0	it manifests the same characteristic features i already derived out of the idea of the un-dionysian : it fights against dionysian wisdom and art ; it strives to dissolve myth ; it places an earthy consonance in place of a metaphysical consolation , indeed a particular deus ex machina , namely , the god of machines and crucibles , that is , the force of nature , recognized and used in the service of a higher egoism ; it believes in correcting the world through knowledge , a life led by scientific knowledge , and thus is really in a position to confine the individual man in the narrowest circle of problems which can be solved , inside which he can cheerfully say to life : i want you
0	the goddess spoke and handed him the veil
0	if you want some action , since sleep has not come to you here either , go with me
0	where these two foaming rivers meet
0	you will find that hard to do
0	or is in hades ' home , already dead
0	keep looking on , and hold yourself in check
0	but his heart would find no joy until he would entered the bloody mouth of war
0	are lying uncared for in odysseus ' house
0	i lost my noble husband—a man
0	this dynamic of the tragic chorus is the original dramatic phenomenon : to see oneself transformed before one 's eyes and now to act as if one really had entered another body , another character
0	peleus 's son went back to his well-balanced ships and huts , along with patroclus , menoetius ' son , and friends
0	if i learn he 's dead and gone , i will come back
0	who have been courting her within the halls ,
0	and some land , too , within shouting distance
0	just like those times two winds blow in from thrace— north wind and west wind suddenly spring upand lash the fish-filled seas—black waves at once rise up , then fling seaweed in piles along the shoreline— so spirits in achaean chests were now cast down
0	and comes to see his mother 's family home
0	would quickly take their vengeance on these men
0	the very ones he wished to choose himself
0	how in hephaestus ' house they first had sex
0	to their delight , the gods release him from disease , that 's how odysseus rejoiced when he could see
0	who paid an excellent price
0	neither ares nor athena , who incite warriors to battle , if they would seen that fight , would have disparaged it , not even if they would been intensely angry
0	aegisthus then accompanied him home—
0	where are your swift lethal arrows and the bowphoebus apollo gave you ?
0	i am going to address the son of peleus , but you other argives pay attention—let every one of you mark my words well
0	come then , tell me this—
0	like many men the black earth nourishes
0	once she reached her father 's splendid palace ,
0	he thinks he will never suffer any harm
0	i throw further than any other man
0	it seems telemachus really does intend
0	i wo not wash myself in front of you ,
0	in order , then , to form a true estimate of the dionysian capacity of a people , we must not only think of their music , but also just as necessarily of their tragic myth , as the second witness of this capacity
0	my fighting power grows
0	do not do that , even if the second is the greater king
0	aeneas , king of men , would have perished there , if aphrodite , zeus ' daughter , had not seen him right away
0	i could escape destruction
0	resourceful odysseus , laertes ' son ,
0	she spoke out once more to her well-groomed housemaids :
0	his father 's vanished , and there 's no one else
0	at priam 's words , the crowd moved back , making room
0	for the minds of gods , who live forever ,
0	expert at war shouts , to let you go back ,
0	i have done good things for you
0	flushed out mountain goats , food for us to eat
0	queen circe 's told me what to do
0	the most magnificent temple lay in ruins
0	that question whether their constantly strong desire for beauty , feasts , festivities , and new cults arose out of some lack , deprivation , melancholy , or pain
0	then athena , goddess with the glittering eyes , replied to zeus :
0	that oath i swore ,
0	i would stuffed in each man 's ears and loosed my ropes
0	and removed the sharp sword from his shoulders
0	the morning frost may be too much for me—
0	straight through—so leocritus fell on his face ,
0	as he fell , powerful elephenor , son of chalcodon , courageous leader of the abantes , seized his feet , and started pulling him beyond the range of weapons , eager to strip him of his armour quickly
0	clasping his hand , she spoke to him :
0	that 's not the reason
0	one made of horn and one of ivory
0	he went up to greet his master , kissed his head , both his handsome eyes , his two hands , then burst into tears
0	and that 's the reason
0	the entire plain was filled with men on foot and in their chariots and with gleaming bronze
0	but now the trojans have your lovely armour , all your glittering bronze
0	with words of reassurance :
0	and secure it quickly with a knot ,
0	on those companions of odysseus ,
0	a massive axe , well suited to his grip , and made of two-edged bronze
0	the beast gets here as quickly as it can ,
0	i will give you clothes and send a favouring wind
0	you led me far from father and my friends , then sold me off in sacred lemnos
0	the son of atreus moved through the troops and gave out many orders
0	the bronze point , slicing under his tongue , smashed through his teeth
0	dear child , come tell me who this man is , shorter by a head than agamemnon , son of atreus
0	a herd of seals—they are the offspring of the lovely daughter of the sea and swim up out of the gray water
0	he granted part of it , part he denied
0	quite generally , only music , placed beside the world , can give us an idea of what is meant by the justification of the world as an aesthetic phenomenon
0	the fiery effects are , to be sure , imitated with a high degree of realism , but the ideas and emotional effects are not in the slightest way imbued with the spirit of art
0	he 's near by , planning a disastrous fate
0	were hideous , as heads were smashed apart
0	then alcimedon , springing up into that fast chariot , quickly grabbed the reins and whip
0	he struck that round leather shield
0	sleep , king of all menand gods , if you have ever listened to what i say , obey me now
0	the men thus occupied , agamemnon did not forget the challenge he would made earlier to achilles
0	in view of his critically productive creativity it must have often struck him that he must be bringing alive in drama the opening of anaxagoras 's text , the first lines of which go as follows : in the beginning everything was a confused mixture , but then came reason and created order
0	that 's the way the gods have spun the threadsfor wretched mortal men , so they live in pain ,
0	or when , in the same way , the cunning witch
0	you drunken sot , dog-eyed , deer-timid coward , you are never strong enough within yourself to arm for war alongside other comrades , or venture with achaea 's bravest on a raid
0	in that ditch many swift horseslost their master 's chariots when poles snapped at the end
0	odysseus had given him a keen-edged sword
0	lie there , among the fish
0	with his hand he grabbed and squeezed his wounded arm , still painful from being hit by teucer 's arrow , as he would attacked him on that high defensive wall
0	no fruit gets destroyed or dies in winter time
0	shrewd telemachus began by speaking to the other two :
0	knowing nothing of the preparations
0	whatever came to hand
0	of arethusa , drinking its dark water
0	what purpose ( that 's the question we need to ask at this point ) could euripides ' intention to ground drama solely on the un-dionysian have had , if we assume its implementation had the very highest ideals ?
0	at persephone 's groves , on the level beach where tall poplars grow , willows shed their fruit , right beside deep swirling oceanus
0	the two lay down together on the bed
0	and brushed aside a tear—he did so casually to hide it from eumaeus
0	then peiraeus , the well-known spearman , approached , leading the stranger
0	the killing of their sons and brothers
0	war-loving menelaus noticed alexander striding there , his troops bunched up in ranks behind him , and he rejoiced , like a famished lion finding a large carcass— antlered stag or wild goat—and devouring it at once , though fierce young hunters and swift dogs attack
0	i will leave you the horses , so i can fight
0	he robbed teucer of that triumph by snapping the fine bow 's tightly twisted string , just as teucer was lining up a shot at hector
0	that god had given it to lord zeus , son of cronos
0	the troops kept dying ,
0	who had endured so much , overjoyed to see it ,
0	father zeus , you wo not get angry with me for what i say , will you ?
0	to those nymphs they call the naiads
0	in its unfettered rush it demonstrates a natural power of the sort we meet , to our shuddering surprise , only in the very greatest instinctive powers
0	and , in a multitude of enemies ,
0	then helen , goddess among women , picked out one , the largest and most beautifully embroidered—
0	responded to with such delight
0	all the bronze and gold and well-worked iron ,
0	a guest remembers all his life the man
0	gathering plentiful supplies and gold ,
0	ranged like that , the two groups will stand against each other
0	she recognized her brother-in-law at once , as he kept busy in the war where men win glory , for he was her brother and her husband 's , too
0	and he returned , bringing the achaeans ,
0	eumaeus , may father zeus treat you as well
0	athena spoke , and pale fear gripped the men
0	when she said this ,
0	by a large swell , and as he quickly looked ahead ,
0	when trojans reached the scaean gates and oak tree , they stopped there , to wait for their remaining men
0	but a cunning man , though he 's got worse horses , keeps his eye on that turning point , cuttingthe pillar close
0	i would left her still alive when i set off
0	intelligence , and planning , we escaped
0	the father of gods and men replied :
0	around his chest he put on the body armour of achilles ,
0	in fact , i would advise you to retreat , get back to your companions
0	much more famous than this political explanation of the chorus is a w schlegel 's idea
0	people heard about it all at once and came in
0	you are too cruel
0	that 's what one calls a world !
0	the best place i could land—it was free of rocks , and there was shelter from the wind , as well
0	he had no clue of what zeus really meant , his plan to load on them , trojans and danaans both , still more suffering , more cries of sorrow , through war 's brutality
0	who are these people ?
0	where i stood , i could see smoke rising
0	meanwhile , silver-footed thetis reached hephaestus ' home
0	they reached the fields of sunny ithaca
0	glaucus , my friend , you warrior among men , now you must really show yourself a spearman , a true courageous fighter
0	it is from this abyss that the german reformation came forth ; and in its chorales the future tune of german music resounded for the first time
0	he kept quiet , looking at his father , always watching him
0	to draw the sharp sword by my sturdy thigh
0	when i would not allow him into battleor to display himself , that time he cameto thebes alone , far from his achaeans , in the middle of all those cadmeans , i told him to be quiet at the palace feast
0	two of the finest men then came at one another in the middle groundbetween the armies , both prepared for combat— aeneas , anchises ' son , and godlike achilles
0	antilochus , if you are telling me to give eumelussome other prize inside my huts , i will do it
0	because he sees so much more around him
0	it 's like what the cyclops did , when our companions
0	inside a woman 's chest
0	antilochus jabbed his sharp spear
0	she pinned the robe around her breast with golden brooches
0	as for me , i had no doubts ,
0	so i answered him—
0	on the threshold , gripping the bronze spear in her fist
0	do not slow down or stand there sad at heart
0	the steep height at malea , storm winds caught him
0	which carry her as fast as stormy blasts of wind across the ocean seas and endless tracts of land
0	patted telemachus with his hand , and said :
0	some years ago laertes
0	no other man can rival him in this
0	see , men and women of troy , come and see—look on hector , if , while he was still alive , you would rejoice when he came back from war , for he was a great joy to all our cityand its people
0	but there 's no way men can go on forever without sleep
0	then from the polished wagon they brought in that priceless ransom for hector 's head , leaving there two cloaks and a thickly woven tunic , so achillescould wrap up the corpse before he gave it back for priam to take home
0	then a man approached , someone from far away ,
0	to these proud suitors and the violent acts
0	but they did not bark
0	looking at hera with a fearful scowl , zeus said :
0	then i moved up and stood at cyclops ' side ,
0	were meant to reassure him :
0	i do not want to take these women 's lives with a clean death
0	then they armed themselves
0	from what i know ,
0	making them forget their troubles
0	the man i trusted most and cherished
0	in them , for the first time , the tearing apart of the principii individuationis [ the individualizing principle ] becomes an artistic phenomenon
0	he gave them to the suitors
0	he collapsed in the dust , like a poplar tree , one growing in a large well-watered meadow , from whose smooth trunk the branches grow up to the top , until a chariot builder 's bright axe topples it , bends the wood , to make wheel rims for a splendid chariot , letting the wood season by the riverbank
0	the achaeans all grew silent , ashamed to duck the challenge , afraid to answer it
0	then this man wo not be shooting any more
0	just as man-killing ares sets off to battle accompanied by his son terror , just as strong , as fearless , who makes any man afraid , no matter how courageous he may be—the two of themsetting out from thrace , having armed themselves to fight ephyreans or brave phlegyans , giving glory to one of them , without listening to either side— that 's how meriones and idomeneus , leaders of men , set off to battle , fully armed in glittering bronze
0	he urges other men to do the same
0	no man 's strength matched his
0	i will show you your course and tell you each sign to look for , so you will not suffer , or , thanks to vicious plans of sea and land ,
0	menelaus , skilled at war shouts , at once
0	that 's idiotic , like a faithful promisebetween men and lions
0	had contemplated all these things with wonder ,
0	to cut down the heifer
0	you have come back from the fight
0	had not been buried in the broad-tracked earth
0	in the killing zone let each man shame the rest
0	because he was the king of all phaeacians
0	and well-tended ships , by the meeting places ,
0	i speak out my holy laughter to myself
0	in the dionysian dithyramb man is aroused to the highest intensity of all his symbolic capabilities
0	just as a wild mountain boar , trusting its own strength , stands firm against a mob , a crowd of men who chase it in some lonely place , with hair bristling along its back , its eyes lit up , like fire , gnashing its teeth ferociously , eager to toss dogs and men aside—that 's just the way the famous spearman idomeneus stood , without backing off , as swift aeneas came at him
0	the trojans can expect from zeus more sorrows , more disasters
0	in comparison with music , each appearance is far more a mere metaphor
0	because in his heart all through that immortal night anxious thoughts about his father kept him awake
0	hence , confronted by the greeks , people have been ashamed and afraid
0	a matter for the men , especially me ,
0	the strong-hooved mules , and climbed up by herself
0	but now , with filthy clothing on my skin ,
0	that 's when those timbers first came into view
0	their own rich flocks , to feast the lady 's friends
0	he kicked ajax behind the knee , taking out his leg
0	leading these men came ares along with fearful strife , bringing war 's pitiless and murderous confusion
0	then he threw his sharp spear from his massive hand
0	was warning me a man might soon attack ,
0	whipping it around , menelaus hurled the helmet in among well-armed achaeans
0	it 's difficult to reconcile the idea of odysseus being far from the sea with the mention of his people ( ie , those in ithaca ) living well all around him , unless , as some legends have it , he leaves ithaca and becomes a ruler somewhere else
0	but odysseus , angry at his true-hearted wife ,
0	many died for helen 's sake , and then
0	but the sword shattered into three or four pieces , falling from his hand
0	at the first place you reach in ithaca ,
0	is anchored over there , close to the fields
0	keeps me in his house against my will ,
0	his heart was growling
0	tragedy closes with a sound which could never come from the realm of apollinian art
0	that 's what appropriate for those who die
0	with powerful king alcinous leading them ,
0	then the sons of nestor went into action
0	but that 's not how things happened to turn out—
0	they set off together , through the wide achaean army 's crowded ranks
0	on their behalf , strong and mighty alcinous
0	with these firm orders , he dismissed the men , who moved off , heavy hearted , along the shore of the restless sea
0	and as for us ,
0	the chariot axle underneath got sprayed with blood
0	so with his huge strides , he kept moving up and down the decks along the ships
0	he turned himself into a hairy lion ,
0	white-armed hera did not answer him
0	i am not that unhappy
0	i regret that , on the basis of the most recent german music , i began to tell stories of the german character , just as if that character might be about to discover itself , to find itself again
0	holy elis owed him an enormous debt— four prize-winning horses with their chariot , which had come to elis to compete , intent on racing for a tripod
0	and others will hate to speak to me as peers , in public claiming full equality with me
0	i will tell you now in detail
0	i will explain it to you
0	his dear nurse eurycleia answered him :
0	who gets angry with me first
0	that unlucky guest , my son , if , indeed ,
0	casts out some bait with his long pole to snare
0	achaeans and trojans were elated , full of hope that wretched war would end
0	but when i would set out , like a fool i would left
0	giving them their orders , an old man 's right
0	antinous in his heart
0	as the sun went down , the splendid presents were brought in , carried to alcinous ' home by worthy heralds
0	and ask him questions about everything
0	once they have taken on supplies of water
0	i am like mortal men
0	even if the others are all slaughteredby achaean ships , you need have no fearthat you will be killed
0	for those phaeacians , her own countrymen ,
0	to drive the cattle in for their own meals
0	bright-eyed athena then said to apollo :
0	the late-setting bootes , and the great bear ,
0	let me tell you something—of all those who came to troy with atreus ' sons , you are the most disgraceful
0	now find it pleasing for the wise odysseus
0	where am i now ?
0	you too , old man , would make up a story
0	this is a man
0	seeing the smoke , my mind and heart considered going down
0	but come , tell me—and speak truthfully—how many days do you require to bury godlike hector , so i can stop that longand keep the troops in check ?
0	forty black ships came with elephenor
0	is a great symbol which i made myself
0	still , i do not expect
0	euphemus , son of god-nurtured troezenus , son of ceos , led ciconian spearmen
0	though i was on my way to hades ,
0	but their spirits fell , as they remembered
0	wise penelope then answered him :
0	son of polybus , began to shout to them ,
0	then , swineherd eumaeus , you answered him and said :
0	would make him keep his distance for three months
0	then athena , goddess with the glittering eyes , thought of one more thing
0	hermes , in his turn , gave it to king pelops , the chariot racer , who passed the staff to atreus , the people 's leader
0	then she can marry the one who offers most
0	but cronos ' son did not grant his wish
0	of deep black wool
0	the conference over , the two parted
0	will not allow the quiver and the bow
0	the first pieces he had cut
0	where , like a god , he sits and sips his wine
0	he would come from fertile paeonia , their best man in a fight after asteropaeus , and his fall filled warrior asteropaeus with sorrow
0	it 's certainly the case , as true as that my son was once alive , he never once neglected in our homethe gods who hold olympus
0	have planned some dismal fate for him
0	but all you other sceptre-bearing kings
0	ends in a swift death
0	by the fourth day he had completed all this work
0	and rising sun , as well as all who dwell
0	of enemies who keep on butchering
0	can the deep hatred against modernism , reality , and modern ideas go any further than it does in your artists ' metaphysics , which would sooner believe in nothingness or the devil than in the here and now ?
0	sing out loud , or giggle softly to himself ,
0	tomorrow morning idaios should go to the hollow ships , to tell the sons of atreus , both agamemnon and menelaus , what alexander has just now proposed , the very man whose cause launched this dispute
0	the colts who bring on dawn
0	that made queen hera angry
0	to whom zeus has given honour and glory , it 's difficult for me to see preciselywhat each of you is doing—this conflictrages on so fiercely
0	olive , pear , or garden plot in all the field—
0	he told me all about achaean plans
0	that is none other than zeus ' daughter ,
0	as long as phoebus apollo held the aegis steady in his hands , on both sides weapons hit their mark— men kept on dying
0	for i will still grant glory to the trojans , to keep on killing till they reach the ships , at sunset , when sacred darkness comes
0	in a silver basin , so they could wash their hands
0	with her encouragement , to sail back home—
0	just as he did his true-born sons
0	of its resources and claim he wo not come back
0	where cimmerians have their lands and city ,
0	those counselors and leaders , were not so wise
0	men who roam about , when they need a meal ,
0	the cruel point kept going
0	he 's had bad luck , but in his appearance
0	nastes and amphimachus , noble sons of nomionwere their leaders
0	strong antiphates , out of a meeting ,
0	in the morning , agamemnon , king of men ,
0	from the great fight—we can be sure of that—
0	with respect to greek tragedy , which , of course , comes to us only as a drama of words , i have even suggested that that incongruity between myth and word can easily seduce us into considering it shallower and more empty of meaning than it is , and thus to assume a more superficial action than it must have had according to the testimony of the ancients
0	many achaeans are hatching evil plans—
0	acamas and warlike peirous led the thracians , those men bounded by the hellespont 's strong flow
0	achaeans all will celebrate his fame
0	the bedpost , i used an augur to bore out
0	meanwhile , circe had been acting kindly
0	that 's the man i was , back then , but now let younger men competein events like these
0	once he would heard these words , eumaeus went and stood beside odysseus , then spoke—his words had wings :
0	and violence reach up to iron heaven
0	even if they wish to stay for fair-throned dawn , they can not not wear me down , for i am a man
0	if any of them fears and honours us
0	in this dark night
0	then lovely polycaste , youngest daughter
0	when hector saw that teucer 's arrow shot had missed , he called in a loud voice to trojans and to lycians :
0	messenger hermes , killer of argus , answered priam :
0	to all the gods who hold mount olympus
0	but seek to win them over with nice words , even though you will surely not convince them ,
0	trojans created a commotion , totally confused , as they rushed in all at once , to gaze astonished at the terrible destruction those two men did before returning to the hollow ships
0	as penelope said this , telemachus gave a mighty sneeze—it echoed
0	trojans had summoned an assembly by priam 's palace gates
0	would be testing lord odysseus
0	so striking up to now , i will make them dim
0	after menelaus spoke , he stripped the body , then gave its bloody armour to his comrades
0	one of those heroic men who perished
0	and only after the spirit of knowledge is taken right to its limits and its claim to universal validity destroyed by the establishment of that limit would it be possible to hope for a re-birth of tragedy
0	i can foretell events much better than you can
0	artemis began a war about this beast , that battle between the curetesand the aetolians , courageous men fighting for the boar 's head and bristly hide
0	despicable paris , handsomest of men , but woman-mad seducer
0	i beg you by olympian zeus and themis ,
0	was driven in , and brave telemachus ' comrades
0	and you , my child , you will follow with me , to some place where you will be put to workat menial tasks , slaving for a cruel master
0	then some arrogant trojan , leaping up onto the tomb of famous menelaus , will shout : amay agamemnon 's angeralways end like this
0	war-loving menelaus felt pity for these two , seeing them die
0	received nine goats by lot
0	hector picked up a rock lying before the gates , thick at its base but tapering sharply on the top
0	it seems to methat another team is now in front , with another charioteer approaching
0	so he stayed home with his wife , cleopatra , the attractive daughterof the lady with the lovely ankles , maripessa , daughter of euenusand ides , strongest of all men then alive
0	that 's how much she 's honoured from the heart
0	where must tragedy come from ?
0	on the front , a dog held in its forepaws
0	singing for the suitors at their banquets
0	a man the blessed gods must hate
0	keep wandering on the sea until you meet
0	from the gods or mortal men , but sail off
0	tell me now , you muses living on olympus , how the fire first got tossed onto achaean ships
0	he spoke to hera , his sister and his wife :
0	if zeus grants me the strength to take your life , i will not abuse your corpse in any way
0	but no man gets his life back , not by theft or plunder , once it has flown out from him ,
0	to push forward with that reasoning and to separate true knowledge from appearance and error seem to the socratic man to be the noblest , even the single truly human vocation , just as that mechanism of ideas , judgments , and conclusions has been valued , from socrates on , as the highest activity and the most most admirable gift of nature , above all other faculties
0	a god who knows the depths of every sea ,
0	they heard and carried out his orders , eagerly and quickly harnessing swift horses
0	onto the ground , and treat him like a sow
0	after he would said this ,
0	and bathe a man the same age as your master
0	but come now , let all of you
0	as he keeps wandering from place to place
0	for all the pain i feel , i will suppress the heartwithin my chest , as i must
0	he 's in a distant land , alive or dead
0	now i would like to give that mixing bowl to you
0	to be a thing of wonder , not like man
0	so be on your way
0	for nine full days
0	i stayed there with him an entire year
0	aeneas picked up a rock , a heavy lift , which no two men now alive could do , although he managed it with ease all by himself
0	but hermes did not find odysseus in the cave—
0	just a phantom royal persephone has sent
0	son of fiery-hearted tydeus , why talk like that ?
0	it lay below the others , shining like a star
0	i could later pray to zeus , cronos ' son ,
0	no one thought to pull the ash spear from his thigh , so he could walk
0	his right hand held a gold cup full of honey wine , so they might pour libations before setting out
0	since it gives you pleasure , kill us , but do in the light of day
0	for as he turned , he tripped against a shield rim , the one he carried , which extended to his feet and protected him from spears
0	i am issuing no orders to you
0	the noble goddess went to them
0	fulfils whatever he has in his heart
0	as some man i just met on my way here
0	thetis did not forget the promise to her son
0	on which the lawless monster polyphemus
0	meanwhile , other gods and warrior charioteers , all conquered by sweet sleep , slept the whole night through
0	but no phaeacian will detain you here ,
0	after this last flourishing , myth collapsed , its leaves grew pale , and soon the mocking lucians of antiquity grabbed up the flowers , scattered around by all winds , colourless and withered
0	by the sea lie carians , paeonians , with their curved bows , lelegians , caucones , god-like pelasgians
0	his pitiless heart replied :
0	to quarrel with each other
0	beside the gate of dreams
0	though he stayed behind , he must have given you strict orders as you left , wouldo not return to me , horseman patroclus , at the hollow ships , until you have slashed blood all over man-killing hector 's tunicfrom his own chest
0	that 's massive ajax , achaea 's bulwark
0	next you will reach the island of thrinacia , where helios ' many cattle graze ,
0	first listen to what greek folk wisdom expresses about this very life which spreads out before you here with such inexplicable serenity
0	on the other hand , many a being more nobly and delicately endowed by nature , though he may have gradually become a critical barbarian in the manner described , might have something to say about the unexpected as well as totally unintelligible effect that a successful performance of lohengrin , for example , had on him -- except that perhaps there was no helpful interpreting hand to guide him ; so the incomprehensibly different and altogether incomparable sensation that thrilled him remained isolated and , like a mysterious star , became extinct after a short period of brilliance
0	the cicones broke through , overpowering
0	and found herself someone to marry
0	nestor spoke this prayer , and pallas athena heard him
0	but gods do not give men everything at once
0	for both of you
0	all the same age as brave telemachus
0	he hit a good fighting man , comrade to aeneas , great-hearted deïcoön , son of pergasus , whom trojans honoured as they did king priam 's sons , for he was quick to take his place among the best , the men who do their fighting at the very front
0	it 's not at all appropriate for a manspattered with blood and dirt to offer prayers to the son of cronos , lord of the black clouds
0	would you young ladies move some distance off ,
1	where is the land that apollo calls us wanderers to , the land of our return ?
1	what do you think ?
1	then on they came , the ausonian ranks in arms , sicanian tribes and time and again the land of saturn changed its name
1	how can you hope to garner all the gifts at once ?
1	or athena 's shrine where the noble trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over ?
1	tending his flocks one day bucolion took the nymph in a strong surge of love and beneath his force she bore him twin sons
1	if you have no use for humankind and mortal armor , at least respect the gods
1	each sacrificed to one or another deathless god , each man praying to flee death and the grind of war
1	under his weight the boat groans and her stitched seams gape as she ships great pools of water pouring in
1	and just outside the wall we must dig a trench , a deep ditch in a broad sweeping ring to block their horse and men and break their charge — then these headlong trojans can never rush our armies
1	but the chief mourners stayed in place , piled timber and built a pyre a hundred feet in length and breadth and aloft it laid the corpse with heavy , aching hearts
1	but i who walk in majesty , i the queen of the gods , the sister and wife of jove—i must wage a war , year after year , on just one race of men !
1	so , was it right for a mortal hand to wound , to mortify a god ?
1	and marshal agamemnon took his lead : pray god you are right , dear brother menelaus !
1	but glistening-footed thetis reassured him : o my child , wipe these worries from your mind
1	agamemnon warmed with pleasure as he came up but menelaus lord of the war cry ventured first , why arming now , my brother ?
1	you know it all so well
1	long as apollo held the storm-shield firm in his grasp the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
1	but to lengthen out one ’ s fame with action , that ’ s the work of courage
1	among the crowds , aeneas addressed them all with : hear me now , mark my words and fill your hearts with joy
1	fools , erecting their rampart !
1	well we have strong arms too , arms to defend those ships — and long before that your city packed with people will fall beneath our hands , plundered to rubble
1	he had just finished dinner , eating , drinking , and the table still stood near
1	true enough , he came to mycenae once but not at war with us — a guest , a friend , with the royal polynices raising troops that time they geared to attack the holy walls of thebes
1	then all night long , ringing the great runner achilles , myrmidon fighters mourned and raised patroclus ' dirge
1	let the games begin !
1	his tremendous back relaxed , he sags to earth and sprawls over all his cave , his giant hulk limp
1	seven tripods never touched by fire , ten bars of gold , twenty burnished cauldrons , a dozen massive stallions , racers who earned him trophies with their speed
1	behind them rank and file withdrew to achaea 's ships
1	that monster — lycurgus cut him down by stealth , not force at all , on a footpath so cramped his iron club was useless fending off his death
1	but polites swept up close to deiphobus ' side , caught his brother around the waist with both arms and dragged him clear of the heartbreaking skirmish , far downfield till they reached his team of racers standing behind the rear lines and rush of battle , their driver and handsome chariot held in tow
1	not with you would it be my fate to search for italy ’ s shores and destined fields and , whatever it may be , the italian river tiber
1	they both refuse to move , saddled down with grief
1	three times they drove their full-maned stallions round the body , myrmidon soldiers mourning , and among them thetis stirred a deep desire to grieve
1	come on , my friend , stand by me , watch me work !
1	and worse yet , the grim predictions of ancient seers keep terrifying her now with frightful warnings
1	i have no heart to be left behind , not even if zeus himself would swear to scrape away the scurf of age and make me young again
1	if we were the same age , i tell you , just as the same fury fills us both — at a single stroke he would bear off glory now or i would bear it off myself !
1	wing my spears through the air !
1	what good would protest do ?
1	patroclus was first to hurl his glinting spear , right at the center mass — the fighters milling round the stern of protesilaus ' blazing ship — and hit pyraechmes , firebrand who led the paeonians , the master riders from amydon , from axius ' broad currents
1	so come , alone as we are , find the best way out : how do we pull the body clear and save ourselves from the trojan uproar , flee our death , our fate ?
1	atrides , end your anger — look , it 's nestor !
1	and in their command sailed eighty long black ships
1	they will erect for you nomentum , gabii , fidena town and build collatia ’ s ramparts on the mountains , pometia too , and inuis ’ fortress , bola and cora
1	his task accomplished , the father turned his mind to another matter , set to dismiss juturna from her brother ’ s battles
1	pray god such grief will never reach my ears
1	— the cool meriones blazed up in his own defense — they crowd my ship and shelter , hoards of trojan plunder , but out of reach just now
1	for now , a crushing end awaits an innocent man , unless i ’ m lost to the truth and swept away
1	on and on they raced , passing the lookout point , passing the wild fig tree tossed by the wind , always out from under the ramparts down the wagon trail they careered until they reached the clear running springs where whirling scamander rises up from its double wellsprings bubbling strong — and one runs hot and the steam goes up around it , drifting thick as if fire burned at its core but the other even in summer gushes cold as hail or freezing snow or water chilled to ice
1	but ares killed them all and all he left me are these , these disgraces — liars , dancers , heroes only at beating the dancing-rings , you plunder your own people for lambs and kids !
1	the goddess reached and tugged at her fragrant robe , whispering low , for all the world like an old crone , the old weaver who , when they lived in lacedaemon , wove her fine woolens and helen held her dear
1	hearing that , the son of atreus strode on
1	as ajax raised the rim , the archer would mark a target , shoot through the lines — the man he hit dropped dead on the spot — and quick as a youngster ducking under his mother 's skirts he would duck under ajax ' shield and the gleaming shield would hide him head to toe
1	but sprinting close to king odysseus ' fleet where the argives met and handed down their laws , the grounds where they built their altars to the gods , there he met eurypylus , euaemon 's gallant son , wounded , the arrow planted deep in his thigh , and limping out of battle
1	but ares swept down to the trojans , helmet flashing , and pacing him went phoebus with long hair streaming and artemis showering arrows , leto and river xanthus and goddess aphrodite strong with eternal laughter
1	and trampling his chest achilles tore his gear off , glorying over him now : lie there with the dead !
1	twelve cities of men i have stormed and sacked from shipboard , eleven i claim by land , on the fertile earth of troy
1	they loosed from harness the horses and the mules , they led the herald in , the old king 's crier , and sat him down on a bench
1	rumor , already in flight with the first alarms of sorrow , fills evander ’ s ears , evander ’ s walls and palace , rumor that just had trumpeted pallas ’ latian triumph
1	and atreus ' son himself , powerful agamemnon seized your right hand , shouting out your name : you are mad , my prince !
1	he flipped the lid of his quiver , plucked an arrow fletched and never shot , a shaft of black pain
1	how that fellow sleeps !
1	as a wolf prowling in wait around some crowded sheepfold , bearing the wind and rain in the dead of night , howls at chinks in the fence , and the lambs keep bleating on , snug beneath their dams
1	we will never shame your kingdom , nor will your fame be treated lightly , no , our thanks for your kind work will never die
1	agamemnon rose to his feet
1	the wife of promachus , alegenor 's son , will never thrill to her dear husband striding home from the wars that day the sons of achaea sail from troy !
1	soon the dawn had raised her light that gives men life , wretched men , calling them back to labor and mortal struggle
1	stop this fighting , now
1	euanthes the phrygian , mimas too , a comrade of paris just his age
1	come , shall we march against them ?
1	my heart grieves for hector
1	and diores backs him up with loud appeals : he finished third , but no third prize for him if the victor ’ s prize returned to salius ’ hands
1	agamemnon turned to the sacred herald : quick , talthybius
1	break your pacts of peace !
1	why don ’ t you look first where you left your father , anchises , spent with age ?
1	now , at last , drive this killing plague from the armies of achaea !
1	cursing each other here like a pair of nagging women boiling over with petty , heartsick squabbles , blustering into the streets to pelt themselves with slander , much of it true , much not
1	why on the road ? —in armor !
1	nestor sat down again
1	and now he might have gutted the ships with fire , blazing fire — but queen hera impelled agamemnon , out on the run already , to go and rouse his men
1	the rascal doubled over , tears streaking his face and a bloody welt bulged up between his blades , under the stroke of the golden scepter 's studs
1	young trojans too , their camp gates spread wide , come pouring out to help ascanius now
1	plenty of insults we could fling against each other , enough to sink a ship with a hundred benches !
1	why , he should have prayed to the deathless gods !
1	let the earth gape and swallow him on the spot !
1	if i have always kept your rites—a far cry from aeneas ’ men who stain your rites with war
1	tarquitus blocked his path as aeneas blazed on and cocking back his spear he flings it and stakes the breastplate fast to the shield ’ s groaning weight
1	that ferryman there is charon
1	but glorious hector taunted patroclus ' body , dead as he was , why , patroclus — why prophesy my doom , my sudden death ?
1	here those who hated their brothers , while alive , or struck their fathers down or embroiled clients in fraud , or brooded alone over troves of gold they gained and never put aside some share for their own kin—a great multitude , these— then those killed for adultery , those who marched to the flag of civil war and never shrank from breaking their pledge to their lords and masters : all of them , walled up here , wait to meet their doom
1	you ’ ll soon see whose windy boasts of glory cheat him blind !
1	and putting the veteran thrasymedes in command , he ran back to bestride patroclus ' corpse again and flanking the two aeantes now , reported briskly , i sent antilochus
1	always dear to your heart , strife , yes , and battles , the bloody grind of war
1	pack all these things aboard !
1	these picked men , still marching in from the whole armada , pressing toward the temple amid the rising din to plead for some good will
1	so the men in heavy armor fought at the front , they grappled trojans and hector helmed in bronze while locrians slung from the rear , safe , out of range , till the trojan troops forgot their lust for blood as showering arrows raked their ranks with panic
1	in the face of blissful gods and mortal men , in the face of that unbending , ruthless king — if the day should come when the armies need me to save their ranks from ignominious , stark defeat
1	the swift runner recognized him at once — disarmed , no shield , no helmet , no spear left , he would scattered all his gear on the bank , sweating , clambering out of the ford exhausted , knees buckling
1	and all night long the tiber lulled his swell , checking his current so his waves would lie serene , silent , still as a clear lagoon or peaceful marsh , soothing its surface smooth , no labor there for oars
1	you will never bring him back to life — sooner you must suffer something worse
1	here , for the first time , aeneas dared to hope he had found some haven , for all his hard straits , to trust in better days
1	but now menelaus , atrides out for blood , moved in to fight for meges — spear poised in his grip — in from the blind side and struck from behind the trojan 's shoulder so hard the spear came jutting out through his chest in all its fury and dolops reeled and sank , facedown on the ground
1	each of us must suffer his own demanding ghost
1	how can he fight the trojans without armor ?
1	but he sensed it all in his heart , their fear , their charge , and broke the silence for them : welcome , couriers !
1	all obey me now
1	he closed on atrides , spear stabbing his shield right on the boss but the bronze could not drive through , so back he drew to his ranks , dodging death , glancing left and right , fearing a lance would graze his flesh
1	not even my own hector , if he came to the rescue now
1	my vicious sons — my humiliations !
1	turnus groans under that barrage , his fury breaks into fire and the outrage bursts from the soldier ’ s deep heart : always a mighty flood of words from you , drances , when battle demands our fighting hands !
1	now , father , snatch the slim hopes of the trojans out of the jaws of death !
1	but all the while diana ’ s sentry , opis , posted high on a ridge , has scanned the fighting unperturbed
1	where did i lose you ?
1	no , deadly fate in league with apollo killed me
1	do not just stand there , do not , dear child , waiting that man 's attack — alone , cut off from friends !
1	meanwhile , hercules was about to move his herds out , full fed from their grazing , ready to go himself when the cows began to low at parting , filling the woods with protest , bellowing to the hills they had to leave
1	— straining to catch me in your fury !
1	like a bearded lion whose pride of cubs a deer-hunter has snatched away , out of some thick woods , and back he comes , too late , and his heart breaks but he courses after the hunter , hot on his tracks down glen on twisting glen — where can he find him ?
1	but if you are serious , speaking from the heart , the gods themselves have blotted out your senses
1	out of the front lines , into the thick-and-fast of spears they ’ d charge as two centaurs born in the clouds come bolting headlong down from a steep summit , speeding down from homole or from othrys ’ snowy slopes , and the tall timber cleaves wide at their onrush , thickets split with a huge resounding crash
1	now , as the first stars set , offer the proper prayers to juno , overcome her anger and threats with vows and plead for help
1	and over it , round it , birds , all kinds , haunting the riverbed and banks , entrance the air with their song and flutter through the trees
1	may both nations , undefeated , under equal laws , march together toward an eternal pact of peace
1	true , the luck of battle might have been at risk— well , risk away !
1	hercules stole our watchdog—chained him , the poor trembling creature , dragged him away from our king ’ s very throne !
1	no gods force us on— we ’ re mortals , harried by mortal enemies
1	the will of god ’ s against you
1	as a heavy surf assaults some roaring coast , piling breaker on breaker whipped by the west wind , and out on the open sea a crest first rears its head then pounds down on the shore with hoarse , rumbling thunder and in come more shouldering crests , arching up and breaking against some rocky spit , exploding salt foam to the skies — so wave on wave they came , achaean battalions ceaseless , surging on to war
1	i ’ ll make a slaughter , cut you a good clean swath
1	one thing more i must tell you
1	so powerful armies drew their battle line dead even till , at last , zeus gave hector the son of priam the greater glory — the first to storm the wall
1	should he fail , surely they ’ d blow the world away , hurling the land and sea and deep sky through space
1	here was your finish line , the end of life
1	here comes aeneas , look , helmed in flashing bronze to oppose achilles now and phoebus speeds him on
1	no time for delay
1	and zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied , tomorrow at dawn 's your chance , my ox-eyed queen
1	with that , he clutched my knees and kneeling , groveling , clung fast
1	ajax and two heralds , both clear-headed men
1	why , why in the world if not for helen with her loose and lustrous hair ?
1	jove himself has whisked away their trusted line of defense
1	many men has two-faced fortune cheated , only to come back and set them up on solid ground once more
1	aeneas , gazing at pallas resting there , his head , his face bled white , and his smooth chest splayed apart by a latin spear , the tears came welling up with words of sorrow : child of heartbreak , was it you whom fortune denied me , coming to me all smiles ?
1	they drive us here—as exiles— with all the arrogance of war
1	from the ranks of men , euphorbus
1	he weighed and carried out ten full bars of gold and took two burnished tripods , four fine cauldrons and last a magnificent cup the thracians gave him once — he would gone on an embassy and won that priceless treasure — but not even that did the old man spare in his halls , not now , consumed with desire to ransom back his son
1	she displays in the sky the strongest sign that ever dazed italian minds and deceived them with its wonders
1	they have pitched camp right at our ships and rampart , those brazen trojans , they and their far-famed allies , thousands of fires blaze throughout their armies
1	think of the glory you will gather in their eyes !
1	but long-enduring odysseus never heard him — down he dashed to the hollow argive ships
1	— no more care for achilles left inside your heart ?
1	he went and brought it , handed it to eumelus
1	she flung her shining veil to the ground and raised a high , shattering scream , looking down at her son
1	now out with it , point by point
1	they marched in cadence and sang their ruler ’ s praise like snowy swans you ’ ll see in the misting clouds , winging back from their feeding grounds , their song bursting out of their long throats with beat on beat , resounding far from the river banks and asian marsh that their pulsing chorus pounds
1	still , i shall go to olympus crowned with snow and repeat your prayer to zeus who loves the lightning
1	but once they would had their fill of gazing at each other , the old majestic priam broke the silence first : put me to bed quickly , achilles , prince
1	what gain for you , your lonely life in the forest , serving diana , our quiver round your shoulder ?
1	why so much grief for me ?
1	this was my last ordeal , my long journey ’ s end
1	you go back to him and declare my message : i will not think of arming for bloody war again , not till the son of wise king priam , dazzling hector batters all the way to the myrmidon ships and shelters , slaughtering argives , gutting the hulls with fire
1	and now his son , cupavo , flanked by fighters his own age on deck , drives along under oars the giant centaur— the monster high on the figurehead makes threats to heave from aloft a massive boulder down on the waves while the long keel cuts its furrow through the deep
1	i call it pergamum , yes , and my people all rejoice at the old trojan name
1	he stepped the mast of a dark-prowed man-of-war far down the beach and tethered a fluttering dove atop the pole , its foot looped with a light cord , then challenged men to shoot and hit that mark : the man who hits the fluttering dove up there can carry the whole array of double-axes home !
1	come — the proof of battle is action , proof of words , debate
1	torches in hand , they left the hall and fell to work at once and in no time two good beds were spread and made
1	suddenly all are demanding this accursed war , against all omens , against the divine power of fate , they ’ re spurred by a wicked impulse
1	the persuasion of a comrade has its powers
1	so king iarbas appealed , his hand clutching the altar , and jove almighty heard and turned his gaze on the royal walls of carthage and the lovers oblivious now to their good name
1	your brother aeneas is tossed round every coast on earth , thanks to juno ’ s ruthless hatred , as you well know , and time and again you ’ ve grieved to see my grief
1	so the old man groaned and seizing his gray hair tore it out by the roots but he could not shake the fixed resolve of hector
1	in the central hall they are setting out a banquet , draping the gorgeous purple , intricately worked , heaping the board with grand displays of silver and gold engraved with her fathers ’ valiant deeds , a long , unending series of captains and commands , traced through a line of heroes since her country ’ s birth
1	he was their city 's bastion , always , even though he came from foreign parts , and a mass of allies marched at his command but he excelled them all in battle , always
1	so they worked away in the rough assaults , but diomedes , which side was the fighter on ?
1	battles , massacres—caesar , the bride ’ s father , marching down from his alpine ramparts , fortress monaco , pompey her husband set to oppose him with the armies of the east
1	a team of pylian purebreds drew his chariot
1	a memento of his host , a pledge of his affection
1	at last phoenix the old charioteer spoke out , he burst into tears , terrified for achaea 's fleet : sail home ?
1	my sons ' wives hauled off by the argives ' bloody hands !
1	but aeneas flies ahead , spurring his dark ranks on and storming over the open fields like a cloudburst wiping out the sun , sweeping over the seas toward land , and well in advance the poor unlucky farmers , hearts shuddering , know what it will bring—trees uprooted , crops destroyed , their labor in ruins far and wide—and the winds come first , churning in uproar toward the shore
1	so this is how you would bid farewell to troy , yearning to kiss her broad streets good-bye — troy that cost our comrades so much grief ?
1	i am much younger than you are , lord menelaus — you are my senior , you the greater man
1	expertly they cut the meat in pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
1	down they come and leave the heights behind
1	ajax ready and waiting there would stab each man with his long , rugged pike — twelve he impaled point-blank , struggling up the hulls
1	we are the ones who ought to do the work
1	if we held our games now in another hero 's honor , surely i would walk off to my tent with first prize
1	with that , he slaughtered fitting beasts on the altars : a bull to neptune , a bull to you , our noble apollo , a black ram to the winter storms , and a white ram to the zephyrs fair and warm
1	remember it we must , and all too well
1	but you , roman , remember , rule with all your power the peoples of the earth—these will be your arts : to put your stamp on the works and ways of peace , to spare the defeated , break the proud in war
1	never , never again shall i return from hades once you have given me the soothing rites of fire
1	hard grief came sweeping over the trojans ' heads — unbearable , irrepressible
1	so he urged athena already poised for action
1	couldn ’ t the fires of troy cremate the trojans ?
1	the battle lines form up
1	but this—and there is no law of fate to stop it now— this i beg for latium , for the glory of your people
1	time and again the strong old prophet said he would die in his own halls of a fatal plague or go with the ships and die at trojan hands
1	in the same breath he struggles to stand erect on his damaged thigh and though his strength is sapped by his deep wound , his spirit is unbroken
1	there he lay like an olive slip a farmer rears to strength on a lonely hilltop , drenching it down with water , a fine young stripling tree , and the winds stir it softly , rustling from every side , and it bursts with silver shoots — then suddenly out of nowhere a wind in gale force comes storming , rips it out of its trench , stretches it out on the earth — so panthous ' stripling son lay sprawled in death , euphorbus who hurled the strong ashen spear
1	giant atlas had been his teacher once , and now he sings the wandering moon and laboring sun eclipsed , the roots of the human race and the wild beasts , the source of storms and the lightning bolts on high , arcturus , the rainy hyades and the great and little bears , and why the winter suns so rush to bathe themselves in the sea and what slows down the nights to a long lingering crawl
1	what lasting thanks for us , for warring with your enemies , on and on , no end ?
1	the cretan captain idomeneus answered quickly , plenty of others can shield the ships mid-line , the two aeantes , teucer the best achaean archer , an expert too at fighting head-to-head
1	never disgrace the generation of your fathers
1	but phoebus apollo spotting her from pergamus heights — the god grim set on victory for the trojans — rose to intercept her
1	the noble old horseman could only bear him out : true , too true
1	aeneas , the good captain , could not permit the fury , the blind rage of entellus to rampage any longer
1	how many gods who hold the halls of olympus have had to endure such wounds from mortal men , whenever we try to cause each other pain
1	or brace for a last , dying stand though hector 's gone ?
1	he would not fight the orders of athena
1	the hive seethes with life , exhaling the scent of honey sweet with thyme
1	grant , father , our shame be blotted out by our spears , almighty god apollo !
1	you know the truth — say it !
1	following them , diores , sprung from the stock of priam ’ s royal house
1	this is the one the fates demand
1	the earth was rich with blood of slaughtered herds and the temple doorways wreathed with riots of flowers
1	so hector prayed and placed his son in the arms of his loving wife
1	aphrodite , smiling her everlasting smile , replied , impossible — worse , it 's wrong to deny your warm request , since you are the one who lies in the arms of mighty zeus
1	that ’ s the doom that awaits our sons ’ sons
1	only patroclus , skilled as the gods themselves while the man was still alive — now death and fate have got him in their grip
1	my wife trails on behind
1	incensed for the dead odysseus speared him straight through one temple and out the other punched the sharp bronze point and the dark came swirling thick across his eyes — down he crashed , armor clanging against his chest
1	we watch it sailing over the topmost palace roofs to bury itself , still burning bright , in the forests of mount ida , blazing its path with light , leaving a broad furrow , a fiery wake , and miles around the smoking sulfur fumes
1	once arcadia ’ s mothers saw them nearing their homes , their wailing set the walls on fire with grief
1	the selleis banks where his host the lord euphetes gave him that sturdy bronze to wear in battle , to beat off the bloody attacks of desperate men and now it saved his son 's young flesh from death
1	down the goddess flashed from the peaks of mount olympus , made her way to her son 's camp , and there he was , she found him groaning hard , choked with sobs
1	and gaining the place where red-haired menelaus nursed his wound and a growing ring of warlords pressed around him , striding into their midst the godsent healer reached the captain 's side and quickly drew the shaft from his buckled belt — he pulled it clear , the sharp barbs broke back
1	following hard on their captain ’ s feat and clear success the etruscans swing to attack
1	he stood there , cast down
1	his mind swarming with all this , pallas athena swept to his side and cautioned diomedes , back — think only of getting back , great son of tydeus !
1	the horses mourned , longing now for their driver , their luxurious manes soiled , streaming down from the yoke-pads , down along the yoke
1	dank night wheels around in mid-career , cruel dawn breaks in the east , and i feel her panting stallions breathing near
1	in whose hands , my guest , do you leave me here to meet my death ?
1	in no time , all were tipping wine on the board with happy hearts and praying to the gods
1	watching it all , the trojan hero heaved in a churning sea of anguish , his thoughts racing , here , there , probing his options , shifting to this plan , that—as quick as flickering light thrown off by water in bronze bowls reflects the sun or radiant moon , now flittering near and far , now rising to strike a ceiling ’ s gilded fretwork
1	breathing room in war is all too brief
1	soon as his sister juturna saw such murmurs rise and the hearts of people slipping into doubt , into the lines she goes like camers to the life , a soldier sprung from a grand ancestral clan : his father a name for valor , brilliant deeds , and he himself renowned for feats of arms
1	if only i outfought you as you can outfight me , i would soon teach you to shirk your work in war — you would pay the price , i swear
1	honor the god who strikes from worlds away — the son of zeus , apollo !
1	and seeing the men , patroclus rose up too as the famous runner called and waved them on : welcome !
1	from there the road leads down to the acheron ’ s tartarean waves
1	silence held them all , struck dumb by his story , odysseus ' words still ringing in their ears
1	these mortals do concern me , dying as they are
1	but once the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen , then the argives mounted a fiercer new attack , fighting beyond their fates
1	so they would say , fueling comrades ' courage
1	our race takes root from jove , the sons of dardanus triumph in father jove—of the father ’ s highest stock , our king himself , aeneas of troy , who sent us to your gates
1	his aide lost no time — the hardy sthenelus rushed to collect the prizes , gave their proud troops the woman to lead away and they carried off the handsome two-eared tripod as he was loosing the horses from the harness
1	and sarpedon clawing the rampart now with powerful hands , wrenched hard and the whole wall came away , planks and all and the rampart stood exposed , top defenses stripped — sarpedon had made a gaping breach for hundreds
1	just look at the maniac , born for disaster , double-dealing , lying two-faced god — just now he promised me and hera , the war-god swore he would fight the trojans , stand behind the argives
1	yet how can a person hear or say a word ?
1	let me carry this hope of you and all the bolder i go to face the worst
1	and we all must battle you — you brought that senseless daughter into the world , that murderous curse — forever bent on crimes !
1	they were drawing abreast , perhaps they ’ d seize the prize if cloanthus had not flung his arms to the sea and poured his prayers to the gods and begged them to hear his vows : you gods , you lords of the waves i ’ m racing over here , i ’ ll gladly steady a pure white bull at your altars , there on shore , and pay my vows—scatter its innards over the salt swell and tip out streams of wine !
1	but capaneus ' son did not forget the commands the lord of the war cry put him under
1	in the eyes of all the world you seized his lance and rammed it home yourself , tearing into my rippling , deathless flesh — so now i think i will pay you back for all your outrage !
1	the father has sped me down to tell you this : so long as you see lord marshal agamemnon storming among the champions , mowing columns down in blood , you must hold back , command the rest of your men to fight the enemy , stand their headlong charge !
1	and that was ajax ' cry as the giant put fresh fighting spirit in each man
1	nestor the noble charioteer did not resist
1	now , since i shall not return to my fatherland , i would give my friend this lock
1	and over and over the old horseman oeneus begged him , he took a stand at the vaulted chamber 's threshold , shaking the bolted doors , begging his own son !
1	so you , his gray-eyed girl , may learn what it means to fight against your father
1	deep in his chest it nestles , ripping into its feast and the fibers , grown afresh , get no relief from pain
1	at that , as she turned away her neck shone with a rosy glow , her mane of hair gave off an ambrosial fragrance , her skirt flowed loose , rippling down to her feet and her stride alone revealed her as a goddess
1	and no mean scout , i will never let you down
1	libations finished , each envoy having drunk to his heart 's content , the party moved out from atrides ' shelters
1	but no locrians followed the hearty little ajax
1	but look at you — fatigue from too much charging has sapped your limbs , that or some lifeless fear has paralyzed you now
1	but every mortal calls the sea-god 's son , aegaeon , though he 's stronger than his father
1	but i bowed to my love of you , bowed to our kindred blood and my wife ’ s heartrending tears
1	he embraced acestes in all his glory , heaping splendid gifts on the old king and urging : take them , father !
1	the earth groaned and rumbled under the huge weight as soldiers took positions — the whole place in uproar
1	i ’ ll make certain they never think they ’ re fighting greek and pelasgian boys , the recruits that hector warded off ten years
1	but ruin is strong and swift — she outstrips them all by far , stealing a march , leaping over the whole wide earth to bring mankind to grief
1	come rising up from my bones , you avenger still unknown , to stalk those trojan settlers , hunt with fire and iron , now or in time to come , whenever the power is yours
1	and so briseis returned , like golden aphrodite , but when she saw patroclus lying torn by the bronze she flung herself on his body , gave a piercing cry and with both hands clawing deep at her breasts , her soft throat and lovely face , she sobbed , a woman like a goddess in her grief , patroclus — dearest joy of my heart , my harrowed , broken heart !
1	call up your courage again
1	they quickly brought out women , flawless , skilled in crafts , seven , and briseis in all her beauty made the eighth
1	crowning the shield , guarding the fort atop the tarpeian rock , manlius stood before the temple , held the capitol ’ s heights
1	wait , with the first northwind that lying pirate will desert us , setting sail on the high seas , our virgin as his loot !
1	what hope can make him loiter among his foes , lose sight of italian offspring still to come and all the lavinian fields ?
1	so he decreed and hermes the giant-killing guide obeyed at once
1	empire stirs me no longer now
1	now go , build me a pyre in secret , deep inside our courtyard under the open sky
1	up with you now , rescue him from the crash of battle !
1	juno brooding , scheming , her old inveterate rancor never sated
1	they were broken men , their lust for battle numbed
1	but i bring achilles ' prayers !
1	i will hold back myself and keep the argive armies back that long
1	and what 's laid up for me , what pittance ?
1	all withdraw to their stations , plant spears in the ground and cant their shields against them
1	now hera the ox-eyed queen of heaven drove the sun , untired and all unwilling , to sink in the ocean 's depths and the sun went down at last and brave achaeans ceased the grueling clash of arms , the leveling rout of war
1	his life breath fled with a groan of outrage down to the shades below
1	just to think i built your pyre with my own hands , implored our fathers ’ gods with my own voice , only to be cut off from you— how very cruel—when you lay down to die
1	ca not you hear him calling his armies on , full force , this hector , wild to gut our hulls with fire ?
1	now , just as the man was about to catch glaucus glaucus suddenly spun and struck , he stabbed his chest , ripped him down with a crash
1	on one side the gaetulian cities , fighters matchless in battle , unbridled numidians—syrtes , the treacherous sandbanks
1	the aged priestess answered aeneas briefly : son of anchises—born of the gods , no doubt— what you see are cocytus ’ pools and styx ’ s marsh , powers by which the gods swear oaths they dare not break
1	but as hector rushed him , idomeneus speared hector , struck the plate on his chest beside the nipple — his long spearshaft splintered off at the head and the trojans shouted out
1	but nisus gets away , unthinkingly flees the foe to a place called alban later , named for alba then , a spot where latinus kept his sturdy sheepfolds
1	aeneas sprang down with his shield and heavy spear , fearing the argives might just drag away the corpse , somehow , somewhere
1	your own scepter ’ s handed over to settlers fresh from troy !
1	he coiled , struck , fanging her wing — a high thin shriek !
1	and so the noble son of antenor , brave agenor would never run until he would tested achilles
1	your own son who never failed in a fight against the argives
1	thick-and-fast as the snows that fall on a winter dawn when zeus who rules the world brings on a blizzard , displaying to all mankind his weaponry of war
1	maybe they ’ ll wring from them the price for my escape , avenge my guilt with my loved ones ’ blood , poor things
1	even he , the mycenaean commander of all greece : the moment he crossed his threshold , down he went at the hands of his wicked queen
1	never once did we fear achilles so , captain of armies , born of a goddess too , or so they say
1	backing over and over , the argives gave ground , seeing the lord of battles lead the trojan onset
1	polypoetes braced for battle killed astyalus — winging his bronze spear odysseus slew pidytes bred in percote , and teucer did the same for the royal aretaon — ablerus went down too , under the flashing lance of nestor 's son antilochus , and elatus under the lord of men agamemnon 's strength — elatus lived by the banks of rippling satniois , in pedasus perched on cliffs — the hero leitus ran phylacus down to ground at a dead run and eurypylus killed melanthius outright — but menelaus lord of the war cry had caught adrestus alive
1	directing aeneas so—and his men are quick with the sacrifice she demands— the sibyl calls them into her lofty shrine
1	there , in turn , for a full three hundred years the dynasty of hector will hold sway till ilia , a royal priestess great with the brood of mars , will bear the god twin sons
1	but the wound — a healer will treat it , apply drugs and put a stop to the black waves of pain
1	they are filling out their fates to the last gasp , hacked to pieces under a single man 's assault
1	over the calm deep straits off tenedos swim twin , giant serpents , rearing in coils , breasting the sea-swell side by side , plunging toward the shore , their heads , their blood-red crests surging over the waves , their bodies thrashing , backs rolling in coil on mammoth coil and the wake behind them churns in a roar of foaming spray , and now , their eyes glittering , shot with blood and fire , flickering tongues licking their hissing maws , yes , now they ’ re about to land
1	no , though as long as i fought on achaea 's lines hector had little lust to charge beyond his walls , never ventured beyond the scaean gates and oak tree
1	not even dryas ' indestructible son lycurgus , not even he lived long
1	he sent me off to troy
1	the day that orphans a youngster cuts him off from friends
1	and on they came , with good odysseus in the lead , and the envoys stood before him
1	nor was his heart displeased to see them both — how fast they would obeyed his loving wife 's commands — and first he issued iris winging orders : away , iris !
1	it 's marvelous — go see for yourself how he lies there fresh as dew , the blood washed away , and no sign of corruption
1	king agamemnon rose to his feet , raising high in hand the scepter hephaestus made with all his strength and skill
1	wind-quick iris obeyed at once and down from ida 's peaks she dove to sacred troy , found the son of wise king priam , shining hector standing amidst his teams and bolted cars , and swift as a breeze beside him iris called , hector , son of priam — a mastermind like zeus !
1	there 's a war to fight with the trojans you stampeded , look , they are packed inside their city walls , but you , you have slipped away out here
1	as hector turned for home his helmet flashed and the long dark hide of his bossed shield , the rim running the metal edge , drummed his neck and ankles
1	now you go down to the house of death , the dark depths of the earth , and leave me here to waste away in grief , a widow lost in the royal halls — and the boy only a baby , the son we bore together , you and i so doomed
1	they covered his whole body deep with locks of hair they cut and cast upon him , and just behind them brilliant achilles held the head , in tears — this was his steadfast friend whom he escorted down to the house of death
1	the charioteers he spotted , fast with teams , he would halt beside and spur them on : my argives , never relax your nerve , your fighting strength !
1	on they rushed , bent on the work of tending to his body
1	or deny me outright
1	the same honor waits for the coward and the brave
1	but fate bars the way
1	and phoebus ’ words were met by a ringing burst of joy mixed with confusion , all our voices rising , asking : where is this city ?
1	and there beside them the great tactician odysseus , drawn up with his cephallenians grouped around him , bands of them , no mean fighters , watching , waiting
1	so in a rush each argive captain killed his man
1	the cretan captain idomeneus answered warmly , trust me , atrides — count on me , your comrade , staunch as i swore at first , that day i bowed my head
1	even now there are two , lycaon and polydorus — i can not find them among the soldiers crowding troy , those sons laothoe bore me , laothoe queen of women
1	over what lands , what seas have you been driven , buffeted by what perils into my open arms , my son ?
1	all as one they make sheets fast and let out canvas bellying now to port and now to starboard , all as one they swing the lofty spars around and swing them back as a favoring sternwind sweeps the fleet straight on
1	and with that , he handed salius a giant african lion ’ s hide , a great weight with its shaggy mane and gilded claws
1	panthous ' son polydamas led the debate , a good clear head , and the only man who saw what lay in the past and what the trojans faced
1	what could she do ?
1	he is no poor man who owns what they have won , not strapped for goods with all that lovely gold — what trophies those high-strung horses carried off for him !
1	and now , somewhere , lost on the crags , on the lonely mountain slopes , on sipylus where , they say , the nymphs who live forever , dancing along the achelous river run to beds of rest — there , struck into stone , niobe still broods on the spate of griefs the gods poured out to her
1	i who saved you before , and along with you your towering city too
1	and i myself , hector , your ally-to-the-death , a good long way i came from distant lycia , far from the xanthus ' rapids where i left my loving wife , my baby son , great riches too , the lasting envy of every needy neighbor
1	gazing out on the deep dark swells they wept and wailed : how many reefs , how many sea-miles more that we must cross !
1	like hounds and lusty hunters closing , ringing a wild boar till out of his thicket lair he crashes , whetting his white tusks sharp in his bent , wrenching jaws and they rush in to attack and under the barks and shouts you can hear the gnash of tusks but the men stand firm — terrible , murderous as he is — so the trojans ringed odysseus dear to zeus , rushing him straight on
1	i ’ ve seen with my own eyes , calling out to me turnus !
1	up in arms he threatens to topple italy ’ s towers , bring them down in ruins , already the flaming brands go winging toward the roofs
1	friendly words , and when he had closed , the prophet ordered presents , hoards of gold and ivory inlays , brought to our ships , crowding our holds with a massive weight of silver , dodona cauldrons , a breastplate linked with mail and triple-meshed in gold , a magnificent helmet peaked with a plumed crest—neoptolemus ’ arms— and then the gifts of honor for my father
1	so they conferred together , building their resolve
1	trojans pounded down on them !
1	until my brother pygmalion batters down my walls ?
1	slipping behind , tydides dropped to a knee and yanked the winged arrow from his foot as the raw pain went stabbing through his flesh
1	at the same time , aeneas , just as fierce in the arms his mother gave him , hones his fighting spirit too and incites his anger , glad the war will end with the pact that turnus offers
1	with that he stabbed at her battle-shield of storm , its dark tassels flaring , packing tremendous force — not even zeus 's lightning bolt can break its front
1	by our great household gods , by assaracus ’ hearth-god and white-haired vesta ’ s shrine , i swear to you both , nisus , all my hope , my fortune lies in your laps alone
1	no , no , put our trust in the will of mighty zeus , king of the deathless gods and men who die
1	some trundle enormous boulders , others dangle , racked to the breaking point on the spokes of rolling wheels
1	the god was just stripping giant periphas bare , the aetolians ' best fighter , ochesius ' noble son — the blood-smeared ares was tearing off his gear but athena donned the dark helmet of death so not even stark ares could see her now
1	pray for fair winds !
1	how that would please the man of ithaca , how the sons of atreus would repay you !
1	her voice rang out in tears , but the wife of hector had not heard a thing
1	ah but then , when the son of anchises saw his dying look , his face—that face so ashen , awesome in death— he groaned from his depths in pity , reached out his hand as this picture of love for a father pierced his heart , and said : forlorn young soldier , what can aeneas , in all honor , give you to match your glory now ?
1	he saw the monstrous achilles and racing on before him trojans whipped in headlong flight , all rescue gone
1	and the squadrons forge ahead undaunted , swift as ever , sailing safely along as father neptune promised , true , but carried closer in to the sirens ’ rocks— hard straits once , white with the bones of many men— now roaring out with the sounding boom of surf on reef when captain aeneas felt his ship adrift , her pilot lost , and took command himself , at sea in the black night , moaning deeply , stunned by his comrade ’ s fate : you trusted—oh , palinurus— far too much to a calm sky and sea
1	why , i even dared fling my voice through the dark , my shouts filled the streets as time and again , overcome with grief i called out creusa !
1	and at once the great soul made a brief reply : no one ’ s home is fixed
1	was it i who lured the trojan adulterer on to lay sparta low ?
1	nine nights they passed the hours , hovering over me , keeping the watch by rounds
1	that 's what the real drill , defensive fighting means to me
1	leaving priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen of argos , helen for whom so many argives lost their lives in troy , far from native land !
1	and hector straining to wade into the press and panicked ruck of men , charge them , break them down — he flung terror and stark disaster square in the argive lines , never pausing , giving his spear no rest
1	all bluff , cunning with words , that 's all you are — trying to make me fear you , lose my nerve , forget my fighting strength
1	at the point of death , hector , his helmet flashing , said , i know you well — i see my fate before me
1	achilles quickly set out prizes for the footrace
1	taking the old man 's hand he gently moved him back
1	here 's more gold — a half-bar more in the bargain
1	the fire lapped at the vessel 's belly , the water warmed and soon as it reached the boil in the glowing bronze they bathed and anointed the body sleek with olive oil , closed each wound with a soothing , seasoned unguent and then they laid patroclus on his bier
1	so , such was i in the ranks of men
1	now he would veer from the trojan melee in a flash then dart back in a charge , pursuing mobs of men but he could not kill the ones he rushed in force — no way for him now , alone in the hurtling car , to lunge with a spear and still control those racers
1	my hackles bristled , voice choked in my throat
1	ascanius steps in , my life depends on father ’ s safe return
1	no more words — he dashed toward the city , heart racing for some great exploit , rushing on like a champion stallion drawing a chariot full tilt , sweeping across the plain in easy , tearing strides — so achilles hurtled on , driving legs and knees
1	and the more she tries to pitch the great god off her breast , the more his bridle exhausts her raving lips , overwhelming her untamed heart , bending her to his will
1	and nestor the noble charioteer replied , royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician , no time for anger now — such misery has overcome our argives
1	and there , i tell you , a pitched battle flares !
1	saturn ’ s queenly daughter is just now putting the final touches to the war
1	but if one saw you here in the rushing dark night he would tell agamemnon straightaway , our good commander
1	better to slaughter beasts on rocky mountain slopes and young deer in the wild than fight a higher goddess !
1	and long as i have him with me , still alive , looking into the sunlight , he is racked with anguish
1	at the same time , grouping against the trojan lines , messapus , the swift latins , coras , his brother too and young camilla ’ s wing—all march into sight , right arms cocked back , thrusting javelins forward , shaking vibrant lances , infantry tramping into position , battle stallions panting , plains mounting to fever pitch
1	and all of us unite
1	podalirius , tracking the shepherd alsus , hurtles through the front where the spears shower down , he ’ s rearing over him now with his naked sword but alsus , swirling his axehead back , strikes him square in the skull , cleaving brow to chin and convulsive sprays of blood imbrue his armor
1	belus had sacked cyprus , plundered that rich island , ruled with a victor ’ s hand
1	was it for this , my loving mother , you swept me clear of the weapons , free of the flames ?
1	so the next fool will cringe at the thought of mounting hateful war against our stallion-breaking trojans
1	but if this trojan , dares , cringes before my weapons , if good aeneas decides and acestes my promoter nods , we ’ ll fight as equals here
1	you gods , if my lips are pure , i pray for vengeance now— deal such blows to the greeks as they dealt me !
1	and if it is my fate to die by the beaked ships of achaeans armed in bronze , then die i shall
1	a black cloud of grief came shrouding over hector but helmed in flashing bronze he hurtled through the front
1	he has a father too , as old as i am — peleus sired him once , peleus reared him to be the scourge of troy but most of all to me — he made my life a hell
1	like mercury head to foot , the voice , the glow , the golden hair , the bloom of youth on his limbs and his voice rang out with warnings once again : son of the goddess , how can you sleep so soundly in such a crisis ?
1	no — if our generous argives will give me a prize , a match for my desires , equal to what i have lost , well and good
1	think of that breakneck heracles , his violent work , not a care in the world for all the wrongs he would done — he and his arrows raking the gods who hold olympus !
1	so creusa cries , her wails of anguish echoing through the house when out of the blue an omen strikes—a marvel !
1	what i really want is to keep my people safe , not see them dying
1	the commander ’ s words relieve their stricken hearts : my comrades , hardly strangers to pain before now , we all have weathered worse
1	he sent them off with the strict order ringing in their ears
1	how he would groan at this , the old horseman peleus , that fine speaker , the myrmidons ' famed commander
1	both men shone in courage , both men blazed in combat , aeneas the more devout
1	now sweat will soak the shield-strap round your chest , your fist gripping the spear will ache with tensing , now the lather will drench your war-team 's flanks , hauling your sturdy chariot
1	then down they lay at last and took the gift of sleep
1	the trojans roared assent
1	but in they charge , the rutulian forces seeing the way wide open now
1	shaft poised , he hurled and his spear 's long shadow flew and it struck achilles ' shield — a dead-center hit — but off and away it glanced and hector seethed , his hurtling spear , his whole arm 's power poured in a wasted shot
1	and i tell you this — and i know it is the truth — one day glittering gifts will lie before you , three times over to pay for all his outrage
1	hard sorrows were hanging over many
1	the brave son of menoetius spoke out first : why do you call , achilles ?
1	there ’ s no salvation in war
1	you tell me to forget the plans of storming zeus , all he promised me when he nodded in assent ?
1	where do we go ?
1	that wild man — hurl him headlong down before the scaean gates !
1	any innocent traveler passing them on that road can stir them accidentally — up in arms in a flash , all in a swarm come pouring , each one raging down to fight for home and children — such frenzy seized their hearts , myrmidons pouring out of the ships , ceaseless shouts rising and over them all patroclus ' war cries rousing comrades : myrmidons !
1	if you had any hope of winning aetolian allies , give it up now
1	dispel your tears for creusa whom you loved
1	but achilles , brave as he is , he has no care , no pity for our achaeans
1	right through the front he plowed like a wild boar ramping in power up on the high mountain ridges , scattering dogs and reckless hunters at one charge when he wheels at bay and drives them down the glades
1	with weddings and wedding feasts in one and under glowing torches they brought forth the brides from the women 's chambers , marching through the streets while choir on choir the wedding song rose high and the young men came dancing , whirling round in rings and among them flutes and harps kept up their stirring call — women rushed to the doors and each stood moved with wonder
1	putting all his strength behind it , pandarus hurls his spear , unpolished , knotted , bark still rough but the breezes whisk it away , saturnian juno flicks aside the approaching wound and the weapon stabs the gate
1	no room there for charioteers to dismount and fight it out , the strait 's too narrow , cramped — we will take a mauling there , i see it all !
1	your mother commands you now !
1	soon as he buckled on his elegant gleaming bronze he rushed through troy , sure in his racing stride
1	it 's wrong to malinger here with talk , wasting time — our great work lies all before us , still to do
1	down you went , whom neither the greek battalions could demolish , nor could achilles , who razed the realms of priam
1	struck with fear at the sight of you , they might hold off from attack and achaea 's fighting sons get second wind , exhausted as they are
1	but why debate , my friend , why thrash things out ?
1	why , what have i done to you ?
1	drive your horses right at these mighty argives , seize the higher triumph — seize it now !
1	showers of whetted spears stuck fast around cebriones , bristling winged arrows whipped from the bowstrings , huge rocks by the salvo battering shields on shields as they struggled round the corpse
1	myrmidons , battalions ranged in armor with greathearted patroclus , moving out now , the fury bursting inside them , suddenly charged the trojans — they swarmed forth like wasps from a roadside nest when boys have made it their sport to set them seething , day after day tormenting them round their wayside hive — idiot boys !
1	but thetis answered , warning through her tears , you are doomed to a short life , my son , from all you say !
1	if a word of what i say is falsely sworn , may the gods deal out such blows to me , such agonies as they deal out to the men who break sworn oaths and take their names in vain !
1	his sword pierces the bronze mesh of theron ’ s tunic , stiff with its golden scales , and drains his gaping flank
1	you — the gods have planted a cruel , relentless fury in your chest !
1	it 's not my way , i would say , to fight at a distance , out of enemy range
1	— if strategy 's any use
1	and trojans hearing the brazen voice of aeacides , all their spirits quaked — even sleek-maned horses , sensing death in the wind , slewed their chariots round and charioteers were struck dumb when they saw that fire , relentless , terrible , burst from proud-hearted achilles ' head , blazing as fiery-eyed athena fueled the flames
1	they would packed behind their shields , ringing patroclus round on all sides , spears jutting as ajax ranged them all and shouted out commands : no one back away from the body !
1	they yearn to grasp their companions ’ hands in haste but both men are unnerved by the mystery of it all
1	let them settle here , if so their hearts desire , and build their city walls
1	but zeus will never accomplish all our best-laid plans
1	i am aeneas , duty-bound
1	what land is this , that you can tolerate such barbaric ways ?
1	whether you ’ re lost or storms have swept you far off course , dangers that sailors often suffer , facing open ocean— shielded now by our riverbanks , you ride at anchor
1	the gear his father brought from ephyra once
1	even then , when i forbade him to go to war or make a show of himself in others ' eyes
1	quick as a wink eurytion , bow long bent and arrow set for release , prayed to his archer brother , aimed at the dove that reveled in open sky , winging under a black cloud— and struck— and down she dropped , dead weight , leaving her life in the stars and bringing home the shaft that shot her through
1	so the two of them made their pact and parted
1	so , on such terms they sealed a pact of peace between both sides , witnessed by all the officers of the armies
1	even then our soldiers sensed that i was the one , the target of that ulysses ’ vicious schemes— they saw it coming , still they held their tongues
1	but his turn next , menelaus rose with a bronze lance and a prayer to father zeus and lunging out at euphorbus just dropping back , pierced the pit of his throat — leaning into it hard , his whole arm 's weight in the stroke to drive it home and the point went slicing through the tender neck
1	and there , grizzled gray as he was , he spurred his men , idomeneus ramping amidst the trojans , striking panic
1	and with that command the prophetess fell silent
1	this maniac , hector — i can not bear him any longer
1	and long as i have him with me , still alive , looking into the sunlight , he is racked with anguish
1	tomorrow tydeus ' son will learn his own strength — if he has the spine to stand the onrush of my spear
1	they were broken , beaten men , the will of the goddess dead set against them
1	such terrible grief kept breaking from her heart as aeneas slept in peace on his ship ’ s high stern , bent on departing now , all tackle set to sail
1	and all the while those vaunting epeans were closing round the fortress , burning to tear it down
1	but in fact the duel had long seemed uneven to all the rutulians , long their hearts were torn , wavering back and forth , and they only wavered more as they viewed the two contenders at closer range , poorly matched in power
1	the rest of your prospects ?
1	menelaus withdrew as he drove antilochus on
1	but you take up your battle-stations at every point , command them , hold them back
1	a nightmare broke his sleep and the sweat poured from all over his body , drenched him to the bone
1	there are no binding oaths between men and lions — wolves and lambs can enjoy no meeting of the minds — they are all bent on hating each other to the death
1	are they bent on holding tight by the ships , exposed ?
1	do not leave achilles there on the battlefield as you left patroclus — dead !
1	if we could haul him from battle , dead as he is , and lodge him behind king priam 's looming walls , our enemies would release sarpedon 's gear at once and then , then we could bring his body back to troy
1	if i ever roofed a shrine to please your heart , ever burned the long rich bones of bulls and goats on your holy altar , now , now bring my prayer to pass
1	the sibyl says no more
1	i reached her in flight and father called it quits despite his towering anger
1	he never quaked , that tydeus , that great horseman — what force the famous shieldsman used to wield !
1	help me now in the thick of danger—glory of stars , guard of the groves !
1	if someone else had commanded me , some mortal man , some prophet staring into the smoke , some priest , i would call it a lie and turn my back upon it
1	sunlight flooded in and the rays laid bare the earth as turnus , fully armed himself , calls his men to arms
1	no monsters on earth more cruel , no scourge more savage , no wrath of the gods has ever raised its head from the styx ’ s waters
1	— he racked his heart and soul — lunge at prince sarpedon , son of storming zeus , or go at the lycians ' mass and kill them all ?
1	as ravenous wolves come swooping down on lambs or kids to snatch them away from right amidst their flock — all lost when a careless shepherd leaves them straggling down the hills and quickly spotting a chance the wolf pack picks them off , no heart for the fight — so the achaeans mauled the trojans
1	the good commander orders all masts stepped at once and the yardarms hung with sail
1	so now let a single urn , the gold two-handled urn your noble mother gave you , hold our bones — together !
1	a vast din swells in the palace , voices reverberating through the echoing halls
1	perhaps he will be persuaded
1	and atrides gave ground , he left the corpse but kept on turning round to face an attack — like a great bearded lion the dogs and field hands drive back from the folds with spears and sharp cries and the brave , battling heart in his chest freezes tight and the big cat , all reluctance , pulls back from the sheds
1	no braving our infantry , grappling hand to hand , the cowards cling to camp !
1	dido aglow with beauty holds the bowl in her right hand , pouring wine between the horns of a pure white cow or gravely paces before the gods ’ fragrant altars , under their statues ’ eyes refreshing her first gifts , dawn to dusk
1	but thetis burst into tears , her voice welling : oh hephaestus — who of all the goddesses on olympus , who has borne such withering sorrows in her heart ?
1	then iopas , long-haired bard , strikes up his golden lyre resounding through the halls
1	ah what chilling blows we suffer — thanks to our own conflicting wills — whenever we show these mortal men some kindness
1	but hector shook his head , his helmet flashing : do not offer me mellow wine , mother , not now — you would sap my limbs , i would lose my nerve for war
1	look — hector the king of the war cry fights beside our ships , assaulting in all his force
1	mezentius makes you burn with well-earned rage
1	and now the trojans collected high on the crest of troy
1	but the son of oeneus , meleager , cut him down — mustering hunters out of a dozen cities , packs of hounds as well
1	a black harvest of naked steel bristles far and wide , and the bronze struck by the sun gleams bright and hurls its light to the clouds like a billow whitening under the wind ’ s first gust as crest on crest the ocean rises , its breakers rearing higher until it surges up from its depths to hit the skies
1	always dear to your heart , strife , yes , and battles , the bloody grind of war
1	and you , in years to come , will welcome him to the skies , you rest assured—laden with plunder of the east , and he with aeneas will be invoked in prayer
1	but keep this message firmly in your mind
1	but no sleep for the headstrong trojans either
1	who is this stranger just arrived to lodge in our house—our guest ?
1	and the old and noble priam asked at once , if you really are the royal achilles ' aide , please , tell me the whole truth , point by point
1	and now from his depths the proud runner groaned : you know , you know , why labor through it all ?
1	and again she lashed her team and again the stallions flew , holding nothing back , careering between the earth and starry skies as far as a man 's glance can pierce the horizon 's misting haze , a scout on a watchtower who scans the wine-dark sea — so far do the soaring , thundering horses of the gods leap at a single stride
1	roars of the crowd re-echo , cheering on his challenge , the air resounds with cries
1	now all towering troy is ruined top to bottom !
1	why should aeneas suffer here , for no good reason , embroiled in the quarrels of others , not his own ?
1	with that challenge athena levered sthenelus out the back of the car
1	a son , or one of his son ’ s descendants born of noble stock ?
1	yield to apollo now and take the better course— the god shows the way !
1	you — i hate you most of all the warlords loved by the gods
1	sprinting a long way back , downfield and fast , hector rejoined his men and sinking down onto one knee , propped himself with a strong hand planted against the earth — and the world went black as night across his eyes
1	an ancient city is falling , a power that ruled for ages , now in ruins
1	but zeus , somehow , was bent on this awesome slaughter of achaeans
1	he refused to let his two boys march to war , this man-killing war , but the young ones fought him all the way — the forces of black death drove them on and diomedes a marvel with a spear destroyed them both , stripped them of life breath and tore their gear away and odysseus killed hippodamus , killed hypirochus
1	this response from father faunus , a warning sent in the silent night—latinus did not seal his lips , rumor had spread it already , flying far and wide through ausonia ’ s towns before the sons of troy tied up their fleet at the river ’ s green embankments
1	just as diomedes hefted a boulder in his hands , a tremendous feat — no two men could hoist it , weak as men are now , but all on his own he raised it high with ease , flung it and struck aeneas ' thigh where the hipbone turns inside the pelvis , the joint they call the cup — it smashed the socket , snapped both tendons too and the jagged rock tore back the skin in shreds
1	never again will you and i , alive and breathing , huddle side-by-side , apart from loyal comrades , making plans together — never
1	he fills with wonder— he knows nothing of these events but takes delight in their likeness , lifting onto his shoulders now the fame and fates of all his children ’ s children
1	we will save your life — this time too — master , mighty achilles !
1	you were my pride throughout the city night and day — a blessing to us all , the men and women of troy : throughout the city they saluted you like a god
1	why , mars had the force to destroy the giant lapith race !
1	he himself , they cry , he should decide it all with his own sword and shield , since he lays claim to the realm of italy , claims the lion ’ s share of honor for himself !
1	and just as our two opposing armies clashed i was the first to kill a man and seize his team , the spearman mulius , son-in-law to their king and wed to his eldest daughter , blond agamede , skilled with as many drugs as the wide world grows
1	but i am not to blame !
1	she wanders in frenzy through her city streets like a wounded doe caught all off guard by a hunter stalking the woods of crete , who strikes her from afar and leaves his winging steel in her flesh , and he ’ s unaware but she veers in flight through dicte ’ s woody glades , fixed in her side the shaft that takes her life
1	once they would gathered , crowding the meeting grounds , the swift runner achilles rose and spoke among them : son of atreus , now we are beaten back , i fear , the long campaign is lost
1	so plan your attack , my friend , muster all your skills or watch the prize slip by !
1	reaching this haven here , where now you will see the steep ramparts rising , the new city of carthage—the tyrians purchased land as large as a bull ’ s-hide could enclose but cut in strips for size and called it byrsa , the hide , for the spread they ’ d bought
1	euryalus froze , his heart pounding with love of praise and he checks his fiery friend at once : so , nisus , grudging your friend a share in your fine exploit ?
1	look at the savage slaughter he has made !
1	the closest enemy ranks he mows down with iron , reaping a good wide swath through the latian front , blazing with rage as his sword-blade hacks that path , hunting for you , turnus , so proud of your latest kill
1	first a race for our swift ships , then for our fastest man afoot , and then our best and boldest can step up to win the javelin-hurl or wing the wind-swift arrow or dare to fight with bloody rawhide gauntlets
1	and all the achaeans shouted their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking diomedes ' challenge
1	and now the lord of men agamemnon has disgraced him , seizes and keeps his prize , tears her away himself
1	when at an anxious time by a secret river ’ s run , under the oaks along the bank you find a great sow stretched on her side with thirty pigs just farrowed , a snow-white mother with snow-white young at her dugs : that will be the place to found your city , there your repose from labor lies
1	trojans and latins , struggling to rout each other , seesawing back and forth as they fight it out on italy ’ s very doorstep
1	here the ancient line of the earth , the titans ’ spawn , flung down by lightning , writhe in the deep pit
1	at pyrrhus ’ death , part of his kingdom passed to helenus , who named the plains chaonian—all this realm , chaonia , after the trojan chaon , and built a trojan fortress , the ilian stronghold rising on this ridge
1	but then , atrides , harrowed as you will be , nothing you do can save you — not when your hordes of fighters drop and die , cut down by the hands of man-killing hector !
1	but grief came over glaucus , hearing his comrade 's call
1	desperate straits — we ca not hold out much longer
1	so off they went , getting some distance on their way and reached the asopus ' grassy banks and reedbeds
1	nothing can fight the son of cronus , zeus , not even achelous king of rivers vies with zeus , not even the overpowering ocean 's huge high tides , the source of all the rivers and all the seas on earth and all springs and all deep wells — all flow from the ocean but even the ocean shrinks from the mighty father 's bolt when terrible thunder crashes down the skies !
1	all aimless then , your fires high in the clouds that terrify us so ?
1	his helmet flashing , hector wheeled with a dark glance : enough , polydamas !
1	they say enceladus ’ body , half-devoured by lightning , lies crushed under etna ’ s mass , the mighty volcano piled over him , breathing flames from its furnaces blasting open , and every time the giant rolls on his bone-weary side all sicily moans , quakes , shrouds the sky with smoke
1	and someday one will say , one of the men to come , steering his oar-swept ship across the wine-dark sea , there 's the mound of a man who died in the old days , one of the brave whom glorious hector killed
1	but lausus rages on , berserk as the savage fury surges higher now in the trojan captain ’ s heart
1	gouged by my spear you will give me glory now , you will give your life to the famous horseman death !
1	look at us here , engaging argives with a vengeance , true , but off on the fringe of brutal all-out war while our central force is routed pell-mell , men and chariots flung against each other
1	first in the latin ranks , juturna caught the sound , she knew what it meant and , seized with trembling , fled
1	disdaining the forces of latinus !
1	consigning the women to the town , they disembark all those who elect to stay , who feel no need for glory
1	more ransom a son of the stallion-breaking trojans might just fetch from troy ?
1	god forbid his anger destroy the army he commands
1	yes , for in my heart and soul i know this well : the day will come when sacred troy must die , priam must die and all his people with him , priam who hurls the strong ash spear !
1	now headlong on and fight !
1	but i would never hurt you — and what 's more , i would beat off any man who would do you harm : you remind me of my dear father , to the life
1	as he sprang in flight the red-haired captain hit him , splitting his belt , and bronze went ripping through his flesh and down he went with a crash
1	pray to wing your way to the starry sky or bury yourself in the earth ’ s deep pits !
1	i never set my eyes on her again
1	with that he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground and patroclus straight across , as soon as he saw him , leapt from his car too
1	what of the trojans putting the latins to the torch ?
1	many others shrink before him
1	not even bacchus in all his glory , driving his team with vines for reins and lashing his tigers down from nysa ’ s soaring ridge
1	the stars go wheeling by , the full of the dark is gone — two watches down but the third 's still ours for action
1	trapped by his craft , that cunning liar sinon , we believed his story
1	the wind ’ s shifted , surging athwart our beam , roaring out of the black west , building into clouds !
1	no looking him in the face , no trying to reach him with a word
1	then dardanus had a son in turn , king erichthonius , and he was the richest man in all the world — three thousand mares he owned , grazing the marshes , brood-mares in their prime , proud of their leaping foals
1	and all the while the armies tense in a broad circle watched for horses flying back on the plain in a rising whirl of dust
1	you are the disaster
1	soaring up with the clouds to the broad sweeping sky he quickly gained the gods ' stronghold , steep olympus , and settling down by the side of cronus ' great son zeus , his spirit racked with pain , ares displayed the blood , the fresh immortal blood that gushed from his wound , and burst out in a flight of self-pity : father zeus , are not you incensed to see such violent brutal work ?
1	i tell you this , so help me it 's the truth : if i catch you again , blithering on this way , let odysseus ' head be wrenched off his shoulders , never again call me the father of telemachus if i do not grab you , strip the clothing off you , cloak , tunic and rags that wrap your private parts , and whip you howling naked back to the fast ships , out of the armies ' muster — whip you like a cur !
1	the troops moved out with loggers ' axes in hand and sturdy cabled ropes as mules trudged on ahead
1	the others tried to snatch our queen from the bridal bed of death !
1	he was the greatest joy of troy and all our people !
1	yet he himself , since dido who means the world to him knows nothing , never dreaming such a powerful love could be uprooted—he will try to approach her , find the moment to break the news gently , a way to soften the blow that he must leave
1	none but telamonian ajax ' giant shield
1	it degrades you to curry favor with that man , and i will hate you for it , i who love you
1	or slashed his men with steel , butchered ascanius , served him up as his father ’ s feast ?
1	they must not destroy them
1	but since that courage of yours would leap all bounds , come share the struggle with me
1	but now , for the moment , let me seize great glory !
1	whatever tribute a tomb can give , whatever balm a burial , i am only too glad to give
1	sail home to the fatherland we love !
1	there he went , the hero leading many thousands , and took his own seat on a built-up platform mid the growing crowd
1	the work done , the feast laid out , they ate well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
1	now , no sooner had jove ’ s dear wife perceived that dido was in the grip of such a scourge— no thought of pride could stem her passion now— than juno approaches venus and sets a cunning trap : what a glittering prize , a triumph you carry home !
1	by day she keeps her watch , crouched on a peaked roof or palace turret , terrorizing the great cities , clinging as fast to her twisted lies as she clings to words of truth
1	and he left them there , dead , and he made a rush at abas and polyidus , sons of eurydamas , an aged reader of dreams , but the old prophet read no dreams for them when they set out for troy — diomedes laid them low then swung to attack the two sons of phaenops , hardy xanthus and thoon , both men grown tall as their father shrank away with wasting age
1	book two : the great gathering of armies
1	even a fool learns something once it hits him
1	but the thebans rose in anger , lashed their teams and packed an ambush to meet him heading back — full fifty fighters with two chiefs in the lead , hunter the son of bloodlust , strong as the gods , and killerman 's son , the gifted cutthroat slaughter
1	atrides hauled his corpse from under the trojans toward his own massing friends
1	but he still would not neglect atrides ' order
1	and apollo lord of the silver bow and queen athena , for all the world like carrion birds , like vultures , slowly settled atop the broad towering oak sacred to zeus whose battle-shield is thunder , relishing those men
1	and a rising sternwind surges , drives our vessels on and at last we ’ re gliding into the old curetes ’ harbor
1	a man , a mere mortal , his doom sealed long ago ?
1	the crews are shouting , cables screeching—suddenly cloudbanks blotting out the sky , the light of day from the trojans ’ sight as pitch-black night comes brooding down on the sea with thunder crashing pole to pole , bolt on bolt blazing across the heavens—death , everywhere men facing instant death
1	but hera the queen broke in , her eyes open wide : decide in your own mind , god of the earthquake , whether to save aeneas now or let him die , crushed by achilles , for all his fighting heart
1	but athena , eyes bright , taking ares in hand , called the violent god away with : ares , ares , destroyer of men , reeking blood , stormer of ramparts , why not let these mortals fight it out for themselves ?
1	that empty glory of yours a runner 's glory , a scurrying girl 's at that
1	what tears could match our torments now ?
1	but messapus will , i trust , tolumnius will , that soldier of fortune , and all the captains sent by so many lands , and no small glory waits for the men picked out from latian and laurentine fields
1	we act on command , we worship the powers of the place , then sail on past the helorus ’ rich , marshy fields , then brush by the jutting reefs of craggy cape pachynus , then distant camerina heaves into view , a town the fates will never allow to move , then gela ’ s fields and gela named for its rushing torrent
1	you will die of shame if the dogs of ilium make patroclus ripping sport
1	then , at a decent distance from the ships , we burn the bodies , so every soldier here can carry back the bones to a dead man 's sons when he sails home again
1	the end closed in around him
1	ah but the two of you — long ago the trembling shook your glistening limbs before you could glimpse the horrid works of war
1	we both know each other 's birth , each other 's parents , we have heard their far-flung fame on the lips of mortal men , though you have never set eyes on mine , or i on yours
1	we will simply offer the argives tactics that may save them — so they wo not all fall beneath your blazing wrath
1	both down but menelaus pitied them both , yes , and out for blood he burst through the front , helmed in fiery bronze , shaking his spear , and ares ' fury drove him , ares hoping to see him crushed at aeneas ' hands
1	or does he refuse , does rage still grip his proud , mighty spirit ?
1	and from all i dragged off piles of splendid plunder , hauled it away and always gave the lot to agamemnon , that son of atreus — always skulking behind the lines , safe in his fast ships — and he would take it all , he would parcel out some scraps but keep the lion 's share
1	day and night i groan , brooding over the countless griefs , groveling in the dung that fills my walled-in court
1	many weapons , too , hang on the hallowed doors , captured chariots , curved axes , crested helmets , enormous bolts from gates , and lances , shields and ramming beaks ripped from the prows of ships
1	now the hundred immense mouths of the house swing open , all on their own , and bear the sibyl ’ s answers through the air : you who have braved the terrors of the sea , though worse remain on land—you trojans will reach lavinium ’ s realm—lift that care from your hearts— but you will rue your arrival
1	rage — goddess , sing the rage of peleus ' son achilles , murderous , doomed , that cost the achaeans countless losses , hurling down to the house of death so many sturdy souls , great fighters ' souls , but made their bodies carrion , feasts for the dogs and birds , and the will of zeus was moving toward its end
1	just as furious now those two , aeneas , turnus rampaging through the battle , now their fury boils over inside them , now their warring hearts at the breaking point—they don ’ t concede defeat— and now they hack their wounding ways with all their force
1	helen ’ s glory , gifts she carried out of mycenae , fleeing argos for troy to seal her wicked marriage— the marvelous handiwork of helen ’ s mother , leda
1	mother — i did your bidding , did my work
1	he called talthybius and eurybates briskly , his two heralds , ready , willing aides : go to achilles ' lodge
1	the man ’ s courage , the sheer pride of his line , they all come pressing home to her , over and over
1	to think in all my misery not one god can bring himself to rescue me from this river !
1	born of a trojan mother to the river-god crinisus , acestes , never forgetting his age-old lineage , gladly welcomes his trojan friends ’ return
1	come , we will set these things to rights later — if any offense has passed between us now
1	as the trojan hero paused beside her , recognized her through the shadows , a dim , misty figure—as one when the month is young may see or seem to see the new moon rising up through banks of clouds— that moment aeneas wept and approached the ghost with tender words of love : tragic dido , so , was the story true that came my way ?
1	and achilles stared with all his might , dazzled , disgusted too , and addressed his own great heart : impossible — look , a marvel right before my eyes !
1	do as your own impulse bids you
1	that ’ s what the gods must mean
1	you too , you are a far cry from the youngest argive here , nor are the eyes in your head our sharpest scouts but you are always blustering , you , you foul-mouthed — why must we have you blurting out this way in the face of keener men ?
1	as he watched the old man he filled with pity and quickly summoned hermes , his own dear son : hermes — escorting men is your greatest joy , you above all the gods , and you listen to the wish of those you favor
1	and worse , i see my trojan enemies crying for my blood
1	always misery warms your heart , your prophecies — never a word of profit said or brought to pass
1	little iulus , walk beside me , and you , my wife , follow me at a distance , in my footsteps
1	and i will add the rites and the forms of worship , and make them latins all , who speak one latin tongue
1	suddenly , getting no password he can trust , he sensed he ’ d stumbled into enemy ranks !
1	antilochus closed to tear the gear from his shoulders , glancing left and right as trojans massed against him , plunging from every side to batter down his shield but they could not pierce that broad glistening hide — no scoring his tender young flesh with ruthless bronze
1	but achilles strode back to his shelter now and opened the lid of the princely inlaid sea chest that glistening-footed thetis stowed in his ship to carry , filled to the brim with war-shirts , windproof cloaks and heavy fleecy rugs
1	no , now menelaus the great spearman ran him through , square between the blades as he fled and raced ahead , tearing into his flesh , drilling out through his chest — he crashed facedown , his armor clanged against him
1	he would never breed more sons to leave his riches to
1	propping an end against the ground as cohorts braced their shields in a tight wedge to hide him , fearing bands of argives might just leap to their feet before he could hit menelaus , atreus ' fighting son
1	the one man , past all others , zeus has plunged in troubles , year in , year out , for as long as the life breath fills my lungs and the spring in my knees will lift me
1	so he mocked as athena and queen hera muttered between themselves , huddled together , plotting troy 's destruction
1	so they labored to haul patroclus from the war , back to the beaked ships as fighting flared behind them wild as a flash fire , sprung out of nowhere , storming down on a teeming city , houses caving in to the big blaze as gale-winds whip it into a roaring conflagration
1	row for your lives , my shipmates—backs in the oars , now stroke !
1	haul ships to shore
1	and iris , zeus 's crier , standing alongside priam , spoke in a soft voice , but his limbs shook at once — courage , dardan priam , take heart !
1	nisus already picks his way , wheeling , groping back through the whole deceptive wood , retracing , scouring his tracks through the silent brush
1	great boulders they trundle down on the raiders , huge weights , trying to break their shielded troops but under the tortoise-shell they gladly take their blows
1	but if such a wild desire seizes on you—twice to sail the stygian marsh , to see black tartarus twice— if you ’ re so eager to give yourself to this , this mad ordeal , then hear what you must accomplish first
1	they rushed to support their lord as he went bustling on and lurching nearer to thetis , took his polished seat , reached over to clutch her hand and spoke her name : thetis of flowing robes !
1	and apollo swept aeneas up from the onslaught and set him down on the sacred heights of pergamus , the crest where the god 's own temple had been built
1	patroclus told his friends and serving-women to pile a deep warm bed for phoenix , quickly
1	none more winning among aeneas ’ soldiers , none who strapped on trojan armor , a young boy sporting the first down of manhood , cheeks unshaved
1	the end closed in around him
1	the majestic king of troy slipped past the rest and kneeling down beside achilles , clasped his knees and kissed his hands , those terrible , man-killing hands that had slaughtered priam 's many sons in battle
1	thick-and-fast as the snow comes swirling down from zeus , frozen sharp when the north wind born in heaven blasts it on — so massed , so dense the glistening burnished helmets shone , streaming out of the ships , and shields with jutting bosses , breastplates welded front and back and the long ashen spears
1	but i never saw his eyes — the team sped by me , tearing on full tilt
1	some sling burnished quivers over their shoulders , high on their necks the torques of flexible , braided gold encircle each boy ’ s neck
1	now come , erato—who were the kings , the tides and times , how stood the old latin state when that army of intruders first beached their fleet on italian shores ?
1	like phorbas to the life , the god sat high astern , pouring his persuasions into your ears : son of iasius , palinurus , the sea , all on its own , is sweeping the squadrons on , the wind is blowing steady
1	and first he met a son of dardan priam just escaping the rapids — lycaon , the very man achilles seized himself , once on a midnight raid , and hauled from his father 's orchard , resisting all the way
1	bodies everywhere— they can see them stretched in the grasses , sunk in a drunken stupor , chariot poles tipped up on shore , bodies of fighters trapped in the wheels and harness , weapons and winecups too are strewn about
1	huge telamonian ajax rose to meet the challenge , tydeus ' son rose too , the powerful diomedes
1	the decks are awash , the charred timbers drenched till all the fires are slaked and all the ships , except for the four hulls lost , are saved from ruin
1	look — all that i promised once i am performing now : i have dragged hector here for the dogs to rip him raw — and here in front of your flaming pyre i will cut the throats of a dozen sons of troy in all their shining glory , venting my rage on them for your destruction !
1	but never bow to suffering , go and face it , all the bolder , wherever fortune clears the way
1	a far cry from the pledge i made evander for his son !
1	she shouts , so slow to pray , to swear your vows ?
1	so down in their midst speeds iris—no stranger to mischief— putting aside the looks and gown of a goddess , turning into beroë , aged wife of doryclus the tmarian , a woman of fine , noble birth who once had fame and sons
1	back through jutting stakes and across the trench they fled , and hordes were cut down at the argives ' hands — the rest , only after they reached the chariots , stood fast , blanched with fear , whipped in desperate flight
1	but the other half were packed in the silver-whirling river , into its foaming depths they tumbled , splashing , flailing — the plunging river roaring , banks echoing , roaring back and the men screamed , swimming wildly , left and right , spinning round in the whirlpools
1	be my messenger , idmon
1	but if they are dead already , gone to the house of death , what grief to their mother 's heart and mine — we gave them life
1	her gray eyes afire , the goddess pallas thrilled that the man had prayed to her before all other gods
1	who could tell such things—not even a myrmidon , a dolopian , or comrade of iron-hearted ulysses— and still refrain from tears ?
1	easy to see what help zeus lends to mortals , either to those he gives surpassing glory or those he saps and wastes , refuses to defend , just as he wastes the argives ' power but backs us now
1	he can not get enough of them , filled with wonder , turning them over , now with his hands , now his arms , the terrible crested helmet plumed and shooting fire , the sword-blade honed to kill , the breastplate , solid bronze , blood-red and immense , like a dark blue cloud enflamed by the sun ’ s rays and gleaming through the heavens
1	the trojans assembled hard by priam 's gates , gathered together there , young men and old , and rushing closer , racing iris addressed them , keying her voice to that of priam 's son polites
1	pyraechmes led the paeonians , reflex bows in hand , hailing from amydon far west and the broad river axius , axius , clearest stream that flows across the earth
1	god store up such pains for his own head and all his sons !
1	an iron tower looms on high where tisiphone , crouching with bloody shroud girt up , never sleeping , keeps her watch at the entrance night and day
1	tell me , what should i do ?
1	and first the trophies are placed on view amid the field : sacred tripods , leafy crowns and palms , the victors ’ prizes , armor , robes dyed purple , and gold and silver bars
1	and caustic drances lends weight to their side
1	the greek battalions are swarming round them all , and if my love had never rushed to the rescue , flames would have swept them off by now or enemy sword-blades would have drained their blood
1	by the sky ’ s lovely light and the buoyant breeze i beg you , by your father , your hopes for iulus rising to his prime , pluck me up from my pain , my undefeated captain !
1	and i , i will lead the way and the son of priam wo not stand up against us , not for long , i tell you , not for all his fury
1	why , think what they say of mighty heracles — there was a man , my father , that dauntless , furious spirit , that lionheart
1	now they could make out hector lord of the war cry , all his troops , squads in reserve and clear of battle , forward squads that fought at the fast trim ships
1	allecto flings a snake from her black hair at the queen and thrusts it down her breast , the very depths of her heart , and the horror drives her mad to bring the whole house down
1	or now do you all abandon sacred troy , all in panic — such was the man who died , your finest , bravest man
1	save me at least
1	quick as you can to the grand sea lord poseidon
1	so , let us rule this people in common : joint command
1	now , hear the treachery of the greeks and learn from a single crime the nature of the beast
1	but at last a cohort marked the driver 's straits , alcimedon the son of laerces , haemon 's grandson coming behind the chariot , shouted out , automedon !
1	and you , achilles , show some human kindness too , in your own heart
1	to trust his walls , the whole command of the battle to a boy ?
1	do as you please , zeus
1	but he quickly found one more , on the left flank of the heart-wrenching carnage — royal paris , fair-haired helen 's consort was rousing comrades , driving them back to battle
1	and niobe , gaunt , worn to the bone with weeping , turned her thoughts to food
1	choose a sturdy spear
1	or if no force can clear our path , you will go down with me
1	if only you ’ d been so passionate for him , then as now , we would have been in our rights to arm the trojans , even then
1	no way for him to escape the dogs and birds !
1	in the same breath diomedes came on storming toward them — closer , look , closing — lashing his team nonstop , full-shoulder strokes , making them kick high as they hurtled toward the goal
1	now all these gifts will be handed him at once
1	remember the wind that scatters the dry chaff , sweeping it over the sacred threshing floor , the men winnowing hard and blond demeter culling grain from dry husk in the rough and gusting wind and under it all the heaps of chaff are piling white
1	and now , muse , sing all those fighting men who lived in pelasgian argos , the big contingents out of alus and alope and trachis , men of phthia and hellas where the women are a wonder , all the fighters called achaeans , hellenes and myrmidons ranked in fifty ships , and achilles was their leader
1	latinus , too , has wealth and the will to share it
1	from oechalia he came , from oechalia 's king eurytus , boasting to high heaven that he could outsing the very muses , the daughters of zeus whose shield resounds with thunder
1	priam 's people could hardly hold the old man back , frantic , mad to go rushing out the dardan gates
1	one life , for the lives of many men
1	as a pair of crook-clawed , hook-beaked vultures swoop to fight , screaming above some jagged rock — so with their battle cries they rushed each other there
1	no blind man 's watch , no , apollo saw athena take tydides in hand , and raging against her plunged into the main mass of trojan fighters to rouse a thracian captain called hippocoon , a loyal kinsman of rhesus
1	i am filled with fear that breakneck hector will bring his word to pass — the threat he hurled against me once in a trojan muster that he would never leave our ships and return to troy till he would torched our hulls and slaughtered all our men
1	he thought , and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground
1	our boys—they ’ re up all night , hunting , scouring the woods , their sport is breaking horses , whipping shafts from bows
1	what if we set you free or you should slip away ?
1	raving , i blamed them all , the gods , the human race— what crueler blow did i feel the night that troy went down ?
1	true , zeus shrank from doing a thing to outrage rushing night
1	we charge them with drawn swords , calling out to the gods , to jove himself , to share our kill
1	hector finished stichius , finished arcesilaus off , the one a chief of boeotians armed in bronze , the other , brave menelaus ' trusty comrade
1	cloanthus who bred your line , you roman cluentius , sails the bright blue scylla
1	so giant ajax marched , that bulwark of the achaeans — a grim smile curling below his dark shaggy brows , under his legs ' power taking immense strides , shaking his spear high , its long shadow trailing
1	and there — meriones killed a trojan captain , laogonus , daring son of onetor , priest of zeus , idaean zeus , and his land revered him like a god — meriones gouged him under the jaw and ear , his spirit flew from his limbs and the hateful darkness gripped him
1	i ’ m to send you out alone into so much danger ?
1	hung from a shoulder , a bow that fit her grip , a huntress for all the world , she ’ d let her curls go streaming free in the wind , her knees were bare , her flowing skirts hitched up with a tight knot
1	squads forming around great ajax , king idomeneus , teucer , meriones and meges a match for ares closed tight for the onset , calling all their best to brace and face prince hector and hector 's trojans
1	— lord apollo the son of zeus replied — we will spur his nerve and strength , that breaker of horses , see if he will challenge one of the argives man-to-man and they will duel in bloody combat to the death
1	now juno made this plea to the lord of winds : aeolus , the father of gods and king of men gave you the power to calm the waves or rouse them with your gales
1	so now they went at the argives , out for blood , and furious for sarpedon hector swung them round
1	breakneck on , impelled by the sharp edge of fear , we shake our sheets out , spread our sails to the wind , wherever it may blow
1	then , for your sake , up i go to the bronze floor , the royal house of zeus — i will grasp his knees , i think i will win him over
1	and with that the red-haired captain moved ahead like an eagle scanning left and right , the bird men say has the sharpest eyes of all that fly the heavens : high as he soars he will never miss the racing hare cowering down low in the dense , shaggy brush — down on its head he swoops and pins it fast and rips its life away
1	he shared all roads and he braved all seas with me , all threats of the waves and skies—frail as he was but graced with a strength beyond his years , his lot
1	have you no pity for him , our helpless son ?
1	i will fling a spear myself and leave the rest to zeus
1	next the men who held mycenae 's huge walled citadel , corinth in all her wealth and sturdy , strong cleonae , men of orniae , lovely araethyrea and sicyon , adrastus ' domain before he ruled mycenae , men of hyperesia , gonoessa perched on hills , men who held pellene and those who circled aegion , men of the coastal strip and helice 's broad headland
1	a trumpet blast rings out from a mound midfield— let the games begin !
1	i will give you this mare i won — of my own accord
1	so come , dear father , climb up onto my shoulders !
1	giant ajax rose to his feet , the son of telamon , tall as a god , turned and broke his silence : ready , odysseus ?
1	so i will never live at the beck and call of zeus !
1	my mind steeled to relive the whole disaster , retrace my route through the whole city now and put my life in danger one more time
1	quick , take arms , pass out weapons , mount the walls , the enemy ’ s all but on us !
1	his aides , elated , lifted the armor off his shoulders
1	so you can see the breed of tros 's team , their flair for their own terrain as they gallop back and forth , one moment in flight , the next in hot pursuit
1	while high on olympus , diana called swift opis , one of her virgin comrades , one of her sacred troop , and the goddess spoke in tears : camilla ’ s moving out to a brutal war , dear girl , strapping on our armor all for nothing
1	and he pitched pisander off the chariot onto earth and plunged a spear in his chest — the man crashed on his back as hippolochus leapt away , but him he killed on the ground , slashing off his arms with a sword , lopping off his head and he sent him rolling through the carnage like a log
1	he was rich in bronze , rich in bars of gold , no feast for the eyes but lightning on his feet and an only son in the midst of five sisters
1	and they limp and halt , they are all wrinkled , drawn , they squint to the side , ca not look you in the eyes , and always bent on duty , trudging after ruin , maddening , blinding ruin
1	there on the ground it lay — he rushed to join it , pitching over the dead man 's body face-to-face , a world away from larissa 's dark rich soil
1	fighting words , and he hurls himself at the enemy ’ s massed ranks
1	defend your people now !
1	aeneas , barely sighting him grieving in the shadows , hailed him first : what god , palinurus , snatched you from our midst and drowned you in open waters ?
1	but now the queen , as soon as the pyre was built beneath the open sky , towering up with pitch-pine and cut logs of oak— deep in the heart of her house—she drapes the court with flowers , crowning the place with wreaths of death , and to top it off she lays his arms and the sword he left and an effigy of aeneas , all on the bed they ’ d shared , for well she knows the future
1	they came in a hundred ships and agamemnon led them on , atreus ' royal son , and marching in his companies came the most and bravest fighting men by far
1	i know , well i know — i am destined to die here , far from my dear father , far from mother
1	my sarpedon , the man i love the most , my own son — doomed to die at the hands of menoetius ' son patroclus
1	he trusted to courage , nerved for either end , to weave his lies or face his certain death
1	old nestor saw him at once and started up from his polished chair , warmly grasped his hand and led patroclus in , pressing him to sit
1	why can ’ t we clasp hands , embrace each other , exchange some words , speak out , and tell the truth ?
1	so off euchenor sailed , both to save his wealth from the heavy fine the argives made deserters pay and himself from wasting illness — no slow plague for him
1	hector 's escaped again , he 's risen from the dead !
1	a rousing appeal , and the father of men and gods looked down and smiled and took command with a flight of winging orders : excellent , hera
1	the tiber heard his prayer
1	hate and defense across it , assault to freeze the blood and right in their midst the gorgon 's monstrous head , that rippling dragon horror , sign of storming zeus
1	as far as a full shoulder-throw of a whirling discus hurled by a young contender testing out his strength , so far they raced dead even
1	grim death , that death assigned from the day that i was born has spread its hateful jaws to take me down
1	hector speared him now — the point split the collarbone , slashing through and out by the shoulder 's base , sticking out the back
1	and here , for those who chanced to long for a breathless foot-race now , aeneas stirs their spirits , setting out the prizes
1	i must say what i have to say straight out , must tell you how i feel and how all this will end — so you wo not crowd around me , one after another , coaxing like a murmuring clutch of doves
1	the last light calls the defeated
1	well i can boast my birth from powerful zeus himself !
1	a sound of grinding came from the fighter 's teeth , his eyes blazed forth in searing points of fire , unbearable grief came surging through his heart and now , bursting with rage against the men of troy , he donned hephaestus ' gifts — magnificent armor the god of fire forged with all his labor
1	what a price they ’ ll pay for the father and son-in-law ’ s alliance here !
1	the father of men and gods began to address them : you have come to olympus now , immortal thetis , for all your grief — what unforgettable sorrow seizes on your heart
1	menelaus yielded at once
1	the ranks shout out while their fathers weep and groan
1	that said , the thracian goddess , plucking a wind-swift shaft from her golden quiver , drew her bow with a vengeance , back to a full draw till the curved horns all but touched , her balanced hands tense—left hand at the iron point , right hand at the bowstring stretched to her breast— then , the instant that arruns heard the whizzing shaft and whirring air the iron struck home in his flesh
1	rushing him with his spear in a sudden surge tydides shouted , stop or i will run you through !
1	once more a new force , a new army threatens the walls of newborn troy
1	patroclus obeyed his great friend and off at a run he went along the ships and shelters
1	attendants run knives under throats and catch warm blood in bowls
1	— gripped by piercing rage
1	find him he did , standing by , flanked by the bands of shielded men who would trooped with him from the stallion-land of tricca
1	now sweeping toward this tree from a clear blue sky— a marvel , listen , a squadron of bees came buzzing to high heaven , swarmed in an instant , massed on the tree ’ s crown and hooking feet together , bent the laurel ’ s leafy branches down
1	but let him catch us lingering here tomorrow , just as he rises up in arms — there may be some who will sense his fighting spirit all too well
1	and that was the first we ’ d seen of cacus afraid , his eyes aswirl with terror—off to his cave he flees , swifter than any eastwind , yes , his feet were winged with fear
1	aeneas hurtles down on the latins—all-out assault— but we can deal out savage death to his trojans
1	we must be on our way !
1	just as surely as this scepter—raising the scepter he chanced to be grasping in his hand—will never sprout new green or scatter shade from its tender leaves , now that it ’ s been cut from its trunk ’ s base in the woods , cleft from its mother , its limbs and crowning foliage lost to the iron axe
1	not a single river failed to come , none apart from the ocean stream that holds the earth in place , nor a single nymph who haunts the rustling groves and the river springs and the lush , grassy meadows
1	and now nine years of almighty zeus have marched by , our ship timbers rot and the cables snap and fray and across the sea our wives and helpless children wait in the halls , wait for our return
1	and now , as soon as agenor saw achilles coming , there he stood , poised for the scourge of cities while the heart inside him heaved like heavy seas
1	i will never beg you to stay , not on my account
1	and back to the lines he leapt and urged each man , no more standing back from the trojans , brave achaeans !
1	over his corpse no letup , the fighters kept on thrusting whetted spears , locked in endless struggle , cutting each other down
1	i launched out on the phrygian sea with twenty ships , my goddess mother marking the way , and followed hard on the course the fates had charted
1	do not stir my raging heart still more
1	the words were still on his lips when , look , saces , riding his lathered horse through enemy lines and slashed where an arrow raked his face , comes racing up , calling for help , crying the name of turnus : turnus , you are our last best hope !
1	the true ghost of her husband , not yet buried , came and lifting his face—ashen , awesome in death— showed her the cruel altar , the wounds that pierced his chest and exposed the secret horror that lurked within the house
1	we will fight again — i will finish you off next time if one of the gods will only urge me on as well
1	the trojans were moved to tears , handsome iulus the most of all
1	let the order i issue now stand firm and clear and the stirring call to arms i sound tomorrow morning , my stallion-breaking trojans !
1	amok as mars by the banks of the hebrus frozen over— splattered with blood , fired to fury , drumming his shield as he whips up war and gives his frenzied team free rein and over the open fields they outstrip the winds from south and west till the far frontiers of thrace groan to their pounding hoofs and round him the shapes of black fear , rage and ambush , aides of the war-god gallop on and on
1	the giant was helpless to rip it off his back
1	they ’ ll rush to the rescue now from every side— i ’ ll sow their fields with swords !
1	for turnus to plant his feet on his own native soil ?
1	the stars were extinguished , the high skies black , the luminous heavens blotted out by a thick cloud cover , the dead of night had wrapped the moon in mist
1	but once i have stripped your glorious armor , achilles , i will give your body back to your loyal comrades
1	brave diomedes killed him off , twelve of his cohorts too , all men of rank
1	then the salii , dancing priests of mars , come clustering , leaping round the flaming altars , raising the chorus , brows wreathed with poplar : here a troupe of boys and a troupe of old men there , singing hercules ’ praises , all his heroic feats
1	and zeus pitied them , watching their tears flow
1	until he makes you his wedded wife — that or his slave
1	both fighters sprang from their chariots , clasped each other 's hands and traded pacts of friendship
1	as fresh as i was that time the feud broke out
1	they promptly obeyed and priam climbed aboard , pulling the reins back taut
1	like a snake caught , as they often are , on a causeway , crushed by a bronze wheel or heavy rock flung by a traveler—trampled , left half-dead , trying to slip away , writhing in gnarled coils , no hope
1	there fate holds out a homeland , calm , at peace
1	full battalions hang on your words , agamemnon — look at the countless loyal fighters you command !
1	no matter , i beg you for their sakes , loved ones far away — now stand and fight , no turning back , no panic
1	this was the hour when rest , that gift of the gods most heaven-sent , first comes to beleaguered mortals , creeping over us now
1	ah for a young man all looks fine and noble if he goes down in war , hacked to pieces under a slashing bronze blade — he lies there dead
1	i am cold with fear — what if they have met the worst , our ranking argives killed in a trojan charge ?
1	men who fought at a distance worked with frequent breaks , dodging painful arrows that showered side-to-side
1	once they would appealed to zeus 's mighty daughter , into the black night they went like two lions stalking through the carnage and the corpses , through piles of armor and black pools of blood
1	once their spirits calmed and the anxious din died down , first the king salutes the gods from his high throne and then begins : if only before now , men of latium , we had resolved this dire crisis !
1	and when they would frisk on the tilled fields ripe with grain they would brush the crests of the corn and never snap a stalk , but when they would frisk and vault on the sea 's broad back they would skim the crests of whitecaps glistening foam
1	he had barely closed and anchises ’ son , aeneas , and trusty achates , their eyes fixed on the ground , would long have worried deep in their anxious hearts if venus had not given a sign from the cloudless sky
1	but soon her father , the holy priest of apollo the distant deadly archer , chryses approached the fast trim ships of the argives armed in bronze to win his daughter back , bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand , wound on a golden staff , the wreaths of the god who strikes from worlds away
1	the old man was terrified
1	on i go and again i see the palace of priam set on the heights , but there in colonnades deserted now , in the sanctuary of juno , there stand the elite watchmen , phoenix , ruthless ulysses guarding all their loot
1	one daughter alone was left to preserve the house and royal line— ripe for marriage now , a full-grown woman now
1	how noble his face , his courage , and what a soldier !
1	then onto the flaming chariot pallas set her feet and seized her spear — weighted , heavy , the massive shaft she wields to break the battle lines of heroes the mighty father 's daughter storms against
1	you must have something better than this to say
1	and so we lay his soul in the grave as our voices raise his name , the resounding last farewell
1	i ca not even hear the battle cry of agamemnon break from his hated skull
1	rushing to meet him came camilla , riding up with her armed volscian ranks and under the gates the princess sprang from her horse , and following suit her entire troop dismounted in one gliding flow as their captain speaks out : turnus , if the brave deserve to trust themselves , i ’ m steeled , i swear , to engage the cavalry of aeneas , foray out alone to confront the tuscan squadrons
1	so they clashed and fought like living , breathing men grappling each other 's corpses , dragging off the dead
1	so complex the labyrinth once in hilly crete , they say , where the passage wove between blind walls and wavered on in numberless cunning paths that broke down every clue , with nothing to trace and no way back—a baffling maze
1	and my dear mother told me i must not arm for battle , not till i see her coming back with my own eyes — she vowed to bring me burnished arms from the god of fire
1	he reined them back in the ring with drenching sweat , lather streaming down to the ground from necks and chests
1	i care nothing for that
1	and here in the heart of the shield : the bronze ships , the battle of actium , you could see it all , the world drawn up for war , leucata headland seething , the breakers molten gold
1	i never dreamed these heroic argive ranks could hold back our charge , our invincible arms
1	you are the one whose age and breed the fates approve , the one the powers call
1	not overly tired , i trust , from all your efforts there in glorious battle , slaughtering trojans , the men you break with all your deathless rage
1	killed by the war-god , never sated — a boy fighting the solymi always out for glory
1	the crew springs up , shouting , trying to backwater , unshipping their iron pikes and sharp-tipped punting poles , they scramble to rescue splintered oars from the surf
1	here in all this carnage the god of fire forged her pale with imminent death , sped on by the tides and northwest wind
1	that 's what it is , and it will be unbearable if the two of you must come to blows this way , flinging the gods in chaos just for mortal men
1	here this aeneas , born of trojan blood , has arrived in carthage , and lovely dido deigns to join the man in wedlock
1	now his loving sister , juturna , spurs her brother turnus quickly to lausus ’ side
1	not if he gave me ten times as much , twenty times over , all he possesses now , and all that could pour in from the world 's end — not all the wealth that 's freighted into orchomenos , even into thebes , egyptian thebes where the houses overflow with the greatest troves of treasure , thebes with the hundred gates and through each gate battalions , two hundred fighters surge to war with teams and chariots — no , not if his gifts outnumbered all the grains of sand and dust in the earth — no , not even then could agamemnon bring my fighting spirit round until he pays me back , pays full measure for all his heartbreaking outrage !
1	and aeneas himself lines up his walls with a shallow trench , he starts to work the site and rings his first settlement on the coast with mounds , redoubts and ramparts built like an armed camp
1	and out of the world of darkness a fury heard her cries , stalking the night with a fury 's brutal heart , and suddenly — thunder breaking around the gates , the roar of enemies , towers battered under assault
1	even then the awesome dread of the place struck fear in the hearts of rustics , even then they trembled before the woodland and the rock
1	if any power on high recoils at such an outrage , let the gods repay you for all your reckless work , grant you the thanks , the rich reward you ’ ve earned
1	and rising over it now the champion ’ s voice comes pouring from his heart : here , eryx , i pay your spirit a better life than dares ’ !
1	this fortress built by father janus , that by saturn : this was called the janiculum , that , saturnia
1	tell us what you trust to , such a willing captive
1	but soon as the gash dried and firm clots formed , sharp pain came bursting in on atrides ' strength — spear-sharp as the labor-pangs that pierce a woman , agonies brought on by the harsh , birthing spirits , hera 's daughters who hold the stabbing power of birth — so sharp the throes that burst on atrides ' strength
1	here as she handed down decrees and laws to her people , sharing labors fairly , some by lot , some with her sense of justice , aeneas suddenly sees his men approaching through the crowds , antheus , sergestus , gallant cloanthus , other trojans the black gales had battered over the seas and swept to far-flung coasts
1	and now the spear-throwers rose up to compete , atrides agamemnon , lord of the far-flung kingdoms , flanked by idomeneus ' rough-and-ready aide meriones but the swift runner achilles interceded at once : atrides — well we know how far you excel us all : no one can match your strength at throwing spears , you are the best by far !
1	let me rest in the grave beside my son , in the comradeship of death
1	but over against them glorious hector ranged his trojans
1	all vessels beached on the front along the shore — haul them down and row them out on the bright sea , ride them over the anchor-stones in the offshore swell till the bracing godsent night comes down and then , if the trojans will refrain from war at night , we haul down all the rest
1	thoughts racing , here , there , probing his options , turning to this plan , that plan—torn in two until , at his wits ’ end , this answer seems the best
1	but there , far off on a lonely stretch of beach the trojan women wept for the lost anchises
1	what were our chances now , at this point ?
1	i tell you now—so you won ’ t think me an empty dream— that under an oak along the banks you ’ ll find a great sow stretched on her side with thirty pigs just farrowed , a snow-white mother with snow-white young at her dugs
1	his prayer went up and phoebus apollo heard him
1	so go for the argives — head-on !
1	mad for a fight , he challenged all our bravest
1	my team stands at the foot of ida with all her springs , they wait to bear me over the good dry land and sea
1	athena laughed aloud , glorying over him , winging insults : colossal fool — it never even occurred to you , not even now when you matched your strength with mine , just how much greater i claim to be than you !
1	first came saturn , down from the heights of heaven , fleeing jove in arms : saturn robbed of his kingdom , exiled
1	while they see to their meal aeneas scales a crag , straining to scan the sea-reach far and wide
1	terrified by their father 's rough commands the sons trundled a mule-wagon out at once , a good smooth-running one , newly finished , balanced and bolted tight , and strapped a big wicker cradle across its frame
1	our prince of beauty — mad for women , you lure them all to ruin !
1	god of the silver bow who strides the walls of chryse and cilia sacrosanct — lord in power of tenedos — smintheus , god of the plague !
1	but come , tell me , eurypylus , royal fighter , can the achaeans , somehow , still hold monstrous hector ?
1	now for flying hands !
1	it 's not some lifeless fear that paralyzes me now , no flinching from combat either
1	but when the tenth dawn brought light to the mortal world they carried gallant hector forth , weeping tears , and they placed his corpse aloft the pyre 's crest , flung a torch and set it all aflame
1	let lavinia go to him—his bride !
1	with that welcome , a wreath of poplar , hung with a poplar garland ’ s green and silver sheen that shaded hercules once , shaded evander ’ s hair and crowned his head and the sacred wooden winecup filled his hand
1	aeneas , spotting him out in the long front ranks , comes up to cross his path
1	by night she flies aloft , between the earth and sky , whirring across the dark , never closing her lids in soothing sleep
1	to what extremes won ’ t you compel our hearts ?
1	but aeneas , no less struck by her unjust fate , escorts her from afar with streaming tears and pities her as she passes
1	the strain is far too great
1	no embrace in his halls from the old horseman peleus nor from mother , thetis — this alien earth i stride will hold me down at last
1	the achaeans were furious with him , deeply offended
1	so home we sail
1	who has sped you here to me , swooping down from the clouds to reach the earth ?
1	where are you rushing ?
1	soon as he noticed glaucus slipping clear , the pain overcame sarpedon but even so he never forgot his lust for battle
1	off and away to other grand , luxurious cities , out to phrygia , out to maeonia 's tempting country ?
1	dear gods , do not bring to pass the grief that haunts my heart — the prophecy that mother revealed to me one time
1	idaeus leapt , abandoned the handsome car but did not dare to stand and defend his dead brother — and not even so would he have fled his black death but the god of fire swept him off and saved him , shrouding the man in night so the old priest would not be wholly crushed with one son left
1	but if the trojans call me to single combat , if that ’ s your will as well , and i am such a bar to the public good , then victory has not spurned or so hated these hands of mine that i would shrink from any risk when hopes are riding high
1	he 's sound of limb
1	well , no hope now of seeing the land where i was born or my sweet children , the father i longed for all these years
1	soothing words , and with both her hands dione gently wiped the ichor from aphrodite 's arm and her wrist healed at once , her stark pain ebbed away
1	achilles gave the bronze-shod spear to meriones
1	the sweat was streaming down his face and back and the dark blood still flowed from his ugly wound but the man 's will was firm , he never broke his stride
1	that man has got no heart in him , not a pulsebeat
1	but you , you are all frightened out of your minds — you can not fight
1	twelve beaked ships sailed out in his command , trim vessels he left behind him in percote , making his way to troy to fight on foot and here he came now , up against agamemnon , closer , closing
1	down in the dust the war-gear tumbled , all still glistening bright in its fresh purple dye but the man stood his ground , still rearing to fight , his hopes still soaring for triumph
1	they traded many questions , wondering , back and forth , what dead friend did the sibyl mean , whose body must be buried ?
1	then , keen to marry a spartan bride , hermione , granddaughter of leda , he turned me over to helenus , slave to slave
1	here we are , under your roof , sent from the whole achaean force !
1	and athena left him there , caught up with hector at once , and taking the build and vibrant voice of deiphobus stood shoulder-to-shoulder with him , winging orders : dear brother , how brutally swift achilles hunts you — coursing you round the city of priam in all his lethal speed !
1	you ca not kill me — i can never die — it 's not my fate !
1	and mulius next — he reared and jammed his lance through the man 's ear so the lance came jutting out through the other ear , bronze point glinting
1	ah if the two of us could ever think as one , troy could delay her day of death no longer , not one moment
1	some news for the myrmidons , news for me ?
1	with that he began to don his handsome gear
1	they keep on coming now , huddling beside me , making plans for battle — it 's their duty
1	as hard at their tasks as bees in early summer , that work the blooming meadows under the sun , they escort a new brood out , young adults now , or press the oozing honey into the combs , the nectar brimming the bulging cells , or gather up the plunder workers haul back in , or close ranks like an army , driving the drones , that lazy crew , from home
1	but euaemon 's shining son eurypylus saw him overwhelmed by the trojans ' dense barrage of spears
1	he gorges himself on the innards and black blood of all his wretched victims
1	simois , xanthus , a greek camp—you ’ ll never lack them here
1	my courage — mine was the first you mocked among the argives , branding me a coward , a poor soldier
1	their morale was low but the men laughed now , good hearty laughter breaking over thersites ' head — glancing at neighbors they would shout , a terrific stroke !
1	just then aeneas hurled his brazen spear at meriones , hoping to hit the man as he charged behind his shield
1	terrified , true , but glaring still , ferocious still as he backs away , but his heart , his fury keep him from turning tail , yet for all his wild desire he still can ’ t claw his way through spears and huntsmen
1	with a sudden , killing look he wheeled on calchas first : seer of misery !
1	father anchises cries out : surely that ’ s charybdis , those the cliffs that helenus warned of , craggy deathtraps
1	as fresh as i was that time i first set out from hellas where the women are a wonder , fleeing a blood feud with my father , amyntor , ormenus ' son
1	whoever defiled your body with that wound will pay with the death that he deserves !
1	as for the fighting , men will see to that , all who were born in troy but i most of all
1	with that he stopped in his tracks , watching keenly— what sign would they offer ?
1	he told him to show them to antea 's father : that would mean his death
1	we invite two men — our best — to compete for these
1	think how dogs and huntsmen off in the wilds rush some antlered stag or skittish mountain goat but a rocky gorge or shadowed forest gives him shelter — they see it 's not their lot to bring that quarry down , their shouting only flushes a great bearded lion ramping across their path , suddenly charging them , scattering men and packs despite their lust for battle — so up till now the achaeans kept advancing , close formation , stabbing away with swords and rugged two-edged spears but once they saw tall hector attack the ranks again they wheeled in terror — hearts collapsed at their heels
1	but apollo lord of the silver bow kept watch
1	whatever the gods give of their own free will — how could we ever choose them for ourselves ?
1	we cleanse ourselves with the rites we owe to jove and make the altars blaze with votive gifts , then crowd the actian shore with trojan games
1	but soon as magnificent paris marked atrides shining among the champions , paris ' spirit shook
1	we ’ ve made the long march and survived its many dangers— we have grasped the hand that toppled troy
1	but lausus , who plays a front-line role in war , won ’ t let his soldiers flinch at pallas ’ carnage
1	won over at last , my father rises to his full height and prays to the gods and reveres that holy star : no more delay , not now !
1	now old entellus ’ voice comes rising from his chest : what if you ’ d seen the gloves of hercules himself and the grim fight he fought on these very sands ?
1	the rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship
1	so antilochus turned and ran as a savage cry went up and hector and all his trojans showered deadly shafts in hot pursuit , but he wheeled and stood his ground when he reached his thronging cohorts
1	down to you i go , a spirit cleansed , utterly innocent as charged , forever worthy of my great fathers ’ fame !
1	here the god of cyllene landed first , banking down to a stop on balanced wings
1	the more he gazed , the deeper his anger went , his eyes flashing under his eyelids , fierce as fire — exulting , holding the god 's shining gifts in his hands
1	there — quick oilean ajax rushed cleobulus , took him alive , stumbling blind in the rout but took his life at once , snapped his strength with a sword that hewed his neckbone — up to the hilt so the whole blade ran hot with blood , and red death came flooding down his eyes , and the strong force of fate
1	whatever is right for you to hear , no one , trust me , will know of it before you , neither god nor man
1	and the breakneck runner only paused to answer , so be it , scamander sprung of zeus — as you command
1	together they sailed from troy over windswept seas and a southern gale sprang up and toppling breakers crushed their ships and crews
1	now , with his rage inflamed for his friend 's death , i fear he will raze the walls against the will of fate
1	so his whole head was dragged down in the dust
1	fight to save your king the marauder seized !
1	but i — dear god , my life so cursed by fate !
1	as the east and south winds fight in killer-squalls deep in a mountain valley thrashing stands of timber , oak and ash and cornel with bark stretched taut and hard and they whip their long sharp branches against each other , a deafening roar goes up , the splintered timber crashing — so achaeans and trojans crashed , hacking into each other , and neither side now had a thought of flight that would have meant disaster
1	the ones you want to win
1	no , command them now to take their food and wine by the fast ships — a soldier 's strength and nerve
1	he prays the gods for peace , he looses the sacred ribbons round his hallowed head and taking me by the hand he leads me to your shrine , apollo , stirred with awe by your vibrant power , and at once this prophecy comes singing from the priest ’ s inspired lips : son of the goddess , surely proof is clear , the highest sanctions shine upon your voyage
1	so we can come to terms by the deep-sea ships and strike our marriage pact — you will find our price for brides not quite so killing !
1	yours , the shame will be yours if your comrade 's corpse goes down to the dead defiled !
1	he ’ d barely finished when there , up on a ridge we saw him , polyphemus !
1	and deep in his sturdy well-built lodge achilles slept with briseis in all her beauty sleeping by his side
1	what wild desire brings you here from olympus ?
1	you race to defend a city already lost in flames
1	so the king of the gods has sorted out your fate , so rolls your life , as the world rolls through its changes
1	they steal on a city buried deep in sleep and wine , they butcher the guards , fling wide the gates and hug their cohorts poised to combine forces
1	their hard campaigning just might come to grief
1	aeneas straddled the body — proud in his fighting power like some lion — shielded the corpse with spear and round buckler , burning to kill off any man who met him face-to-face and he loosed a bloodcurdling cry
1	and an argive armed in bronze would call out , friends !
1	so he cried but antilochus drove on all the wilder , cracking his lash for more speed like a man stone deaf
1	the daughter of trim-heeled marpessa , euenus ' child , and her husband idas , strongest man of the men who once walked the earth — he even braved apollo , he drew his bow at the archer , all for marpessa the girl with lovely ankles
1	here is a heart that spurns the light , that counts the honor you ’ re after cheap at the price of life !
1	take me with you over the waves
1	again , in a deep recess under rocky cliffs , [ screened around by trees and trembling shade , ] we deck our tables out , relight the altar-fire but again , from some new height , some hidden nest the rout comes screaming at their quarry , flapping round us , slashing with claw-feet , hook-beaks fouling our meal
1	one after another pressed them with questions , king agamemnon most urgent of all : come — tell me , famous odysseus , achaea 's pride and glory — will he fight the fire off the ships ?
1	here i saw it—our first omen : four horses , snow-white , cropping the grasslands far and wide
1	and with one accord the trojans murmured yes
1	so we can seize the shield of nestor — its fame hits the skies , solid gold , the handgrips and the shield itself — and strip from the stallion-breaking diomedes ' back the burnished armor hephaestus forged with all his skill
1	they waste no time , moving out on command , setting a brisk pace
1	so till the sun bestrode the sky at high noon the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
1	his mother ’ s birds— the great captain knew them and raised a prayer of joy : be my guides !
1	seeing their grief the father , filled with pity , quickly turned to athena with winging words : my child , have you abandoned him forever ?
1	but one thing more
1	at last one strategy struck her mind as best : she would dress in all her glory and go to ida — perhaps the old desire would overwhelm the king to lie by her naked body and make immortal love and she might drift an oblivious , soft warm sleep across his eyes and numb that seething brain
1	for you never died in bed and stretched your arms to me or said some last word from the heart i can remember , always , weeping for you through all my nights and days !
1	and on that resolve he drew the whetted sword that hung at his side , tempered , massive , and gathering all his force he swooped like a soaring eagle launching down from the dark clouds to earth to snatch some helpless lamb or trembling hare
1	no one could underrate these gifts of yours , not now , the treasure trove you offer prince achilles
1	but drawing his sharp sword , achilles charged , wild , hurtling toward him , loosing a savage cry as aeneas hefted a boulder in his hands , a tremendous feat — no two men could hoist it , weak as men are now , but all on his own he raised it high with ease
1	but the swift runner achilles broke in sharply — field marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , produce the gifts if you like , as you see fit , or keep them back , it 's up to you
1	children and trembling mothers rounded up in a long , endless line
1	but best by far of the men was telamonian ajax while achilles raged apart
1	hurl him headlong down , sprawled at our high gates !
1	meriones carried off the double-axes , all ten , teucer took the singles back to his hollow ships
1	as firm as a sturdy oak grown tough with age when the northwinds blasting off the alps compete , fighting left and right , to wrench it from the earth , and the winds scream , the trunk shudders , its leafy crest showers across the ground but it clings firm to its rock , its roots stretching as deep into the dark world below as its crown goes towering toward the gales of heaven— so firm the hero stands : buffeted left and right by storms of appeals , he takes the full force of love and suffering deep in his great heart
1	nothing , my friend , priam ’ s son replies , you have left nothing undone
1	no , the rudder i clung to , holding us all on course—my charge— some powerful force ripped it away by chance and i dragged it down as i dropped headlong too
1	he 's fasting , never fed
1	too mighty , the roman race , it seemed to you above , if this grand gift should last
1	no , nisus insisted , i had no such qualm about you— how wrong i ’ d be
1	come , up you go in our chariot , give ground now !
1	why , it would have been fairer for turnus to meet this death !
1	whirling words—i was swept away by fury now ] when all of a sudden there my loving mother stood before my eyes , but i had never seen her so clearly , her pure radiance shining down upon me through the night , the goddess in all her glory , just as the gods behold her build , her awesome beauty
1	on the tenth achilles called all ranks to muster — the impulse seized him , sent by white-armed hera grieving to see achaean fighters drop and die
1	i shall never deny what you deserve , my queen , never regret my memories of dido , not while i can recall myself and draw the breath of life
1	and here he sees deiphobus too , priam ’ s son mutilated , his whole body , his face hacked to pieces— ah , so cruel—his face and both his hands , and his ears ripped from his ravaged head , his nostrils slashed , disgraceful wound
1	come , we will swear to the gods , the highest witnesses — the gods will oversee our binding pacts
1	leaving priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen of argos , helen for whom so many argives lost their lives in troy , far from native land
1	not if she rivaled aphrodite in all her golden glory , not if she matched the crafts of clear-eyed athena , not even then would i make her my wife !
1	look , plenty of trojans there for me to kill , your famous allies too , any soldier the god will bring in range or i can run to ground
1	let us put our griefs to rest in our own hearts , rake them up no more , raw as we are with mourning
1	the king denies you your bride , denies you your dowry earned in blood , he seeks a stranger as heir to his royal throne
1	and it 's just twelve days that i have been home in troy — all i have suffered !
1	they come to their senses , know their people , and juno is driven from their hearts
1	she began to bear her dear son from the fighting
1	you are the younger-born , and i — it 's wrong for me , since i have years on you and i know the world much better
1	brothers-in-arms of peleus ' son achilles !
1	then in the thick of the din , suddenly , look , a messenger rushes in through the royal palace , spreading panic across the city : armies marching !
1	how shameful — and now the rest of our men-at-arms must harbor anger against me deep inside their hearts , just like achilles
1	and here comes pallas ’ warhorse , blaze , regalia set aside , weeping , ambling on , big tears rivering down his face
1	now you can not bring yourselves to save him — even his corpse — so his wife can see him , his mother and his child , his father priam and priam 's people : how they would rush to burn his body on the pyre and give him royal rites !
1	both gods were enraged at niobe
1	like powerful stallions sweeping round the post for trophies , galloping full stretch with some fine prize at stake , a tripod , say , or woman offered up at funeral games for some brave hero fallen — so the two of them whirled three times around the city of priam , sprinting at top speed while all the gods gazed down , and the father of men and gods broke forth among them now : unbearable — a man i love , hunted round his own city walls and right before my eyes
1	just then aeneas hurries in with his trojan troops but the women , terrified , scatter down the beaches , fleeing , stealing away into woods and rocky caverns , anywhere they can hide
1	who can make a song of slaughter in all its forms— the deaths of captains down the entire field , dealt now by turnus , now by aeneas , kill for kill ?
1	down you dive from the high skies , opis my nymph , light out for the latin lands where battle flares and the omens all are bad
1	the rutulians spring up with a groan and the hillsides round groan back and the tall groves far and wide resound with the long-drawn moan
1	aeneas cuts his way to the waiting ships to see his crews again , then sets a course straight on to caieta ’ s harbor
1	let no one hold back now , waiting further summons — these are your summons : pain and death to the man who skulks beside the ships !
1	putting the mass of horse and men behind him dolon picked up speed , hot for action now , but keen as a god odysseus saw him coming and alerted diomedes : who is this ?
1	but you see that pair of spirits ?
1	no , such pride , such violence has no place in the hearts of beaten men
1	and now they approach diana ’ s sacred grove and walk beneath the golden roofs of god
1	but you , hector , you go back to the city , tell our mother to gather all the older noble women together in gray-eyed athena 's shrine on the city 's crest , unlock the doors of the goddess ' sacred chamber — and take a robe , the largest , loveliest robe that she can find throughout the royal halls , a gift that far and away she prizes most herself , and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess ' knees
1	he dragged them up on the banks , dazed like fawns , lashed their hands behind them with well-cut straps — their own belts that cinched their billowing war-shirts — gave them to friends to lead away to the beaked ships and back he whirled , insane to hack more flesh
1	no herald of doom , i come on a friendly mission — i come with all good will
1	then they renew their strength with food , stretched out on the beachgrass , fill themselves with seasoned wine and venison rich and crisp
1	halting near she gave achilles a flight of marching orders : to arms — son of peleus !
1	and once the god has led him within the fighter 's shelter , achilles will not kill him — he will hold back all the rest : achilles is no madman , no reckless fool , not the one to defy the gods ' commands
1	meanwhile the argives blocked the trojan assault but they still could not repel them from the fleet , outnumbering them as they did
1	now ’ s the time for horse and chariot
1	calling so , he rakes the slumbering coals to worship the household god of troy and the sacred shrine of white-haired vesta , offering up a suppliant ’ s hallowed meal , and mist from an overflowing censer
1	remind him of that , now , go and sit beside him , grasp his knees
1	but blazing achilles strained to engage prince hector , plunge in battle with him beyond all others — achilles yearning now to glut with hector 's blood , his , no other , ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield
1	you will see your promised city , see lavinium ’ s walls and bear your great-hearted aeneas up to the stars on high
1	yes , down like a lurid rainbow zeus sends arching down to mortal men from the high skies , a sign of war or blizzard to freeze the summer 's warmth and put a halt to men 's work on the face of the earth and harry flocks — so shrouded round in a lurid cloud came pallas now and dove in the argive ranks to fire up each man
1	but nestor the noble charioteer replied at length , now why is achilles so cast down with grief for this or that achaean winged by a stray shaft ?
1	next he displays the grand grove that heroic romulus restored as a refuge—the asylum—then shows him , under its chilly rock , the grotto called the lupercal , in the old arcadian way , pan of mount lycaeus
1	the rest attack with me where i command !
1	by chance apollo , god of the flowing hair enthroned on a cloud in the broad sweeping sky , was glancing down at ausonia ’ s troops and camp and calls to iulus flushed with triumph now : bravo , my boy , bravo , your newborn courage !
1	who will lead the herd ? — while the bulls battle it out , horns butting , locking , goring each other , necks and shoulders roped in blood and the woods resound as they grunt and bellow out
1	but you , with your saffron braided dress , your flashy purple , you live for lazing , lost in your dancing , your delight , blowzy sleeves on your war-shirts , ribbons on bonnets
1	working it out , his heart racing as on they came , waves of trojan soldiers and hector led them in
1	aeneas gives a groan , heaving up from his depths , he sees the plundered armor , the car , the corpse of his great friend , and priam reaching out with helpless hands
1	odysseus struck democoon , priam 's bastard son come down from abydos , priam 's racing-stables
1	you ’ re up against superhuman power , can ’ t you see ?
1	but turnus ’ hot fury , his mad lust for carnage drives him against his foes
1	but with hera , though , i am not so outraged , so irate — it 's always her way to thwart my will , whatever i command
1	but you , menelaus , the blessed deathless gods did not forget you , zeus 's daughter the queen of fighters first of all
1	so raging turnus runs for it , scours the field , now here , now there , weaving in tangled circles as trojans crowd him hard , a dense ring of them shutting him in , with a wild swamp to the left and steep walls to the right
1	so their cries urged on the achaeans ' war-lust
1	a thousand fires were burning there on the plain and beside each fire sat fifty fighting men poised in the leaping blaze , and champing oats and glistening barley , stationed by their chariots , stallions waited for dawn to mount her glowing throne
1	freshening breezes blow as night comes on and a full moon speeds their course , its dancing light strikes sparkles off the waves
1	bury our dead , with tears for the day they die , not one day more
1	so come , follow old nautes ’ good sound advice : choose your elite troops , your bravest hearts , and sail them on to italy
1	achilles , startled , sprang to his feet , the lyre still in his hands , leaving the seat where he had sat in peace
1	he had no spear in reserve
1	now both armies come to a halt before the city , building dikes to fortify their camps
1	what does he long to gain , if luck is on his side , from open warfare ?
1	pity your mother too , if i ever gave you the breast to soothe your troubles , remember it now , dear boy — beat back that savage man from safe inside the walls !
1	then prince achilles stood and addressed the argives keen for battle : father zeus — great are the blinding frenzies you deal out to men !
1	is that what you are turning over in your mind , my glorious one , achilles ?
1	catching sight of a third fighter , ajax , the old king asked her next , who 's that other achaean , so powerful , so well-built ?
1	he spread the gates at once , slid back the bars and ushered priam in with his wagon-load of treasure
1	but the noble horseman nestor shouted back , nonsense , steady tydeus ' son — such loose talk !
1	the old man cried , pitifully , hands reaching out to him , oh hector !
1	you came third , and all you could do was finish off my life
1	so handing his gear to a loyal aide laodocus , who maneuvered his pawing horses close by , he set off at a run
1	bellerophon 's bent on dragging me down with him in lust though i fight him all the way !
1	no charging the front ranks — you might lose your life
1	then she made her way with a file of noble women rushing in her train
1	so now , each of you , turn straight for the enemy , live or die — that is the lovely give-and-take of war
1	the seer rose to the moment : famous captain of troy , no pure soul may set foot on that wicked threshold
1	these , these are the gifts we claim — they are our rights
1	our goddess of love — i would swear she 's just been rousing another argive , another beauty to pant and lust for trojans , those men the goddess loves to such despair
1	across the entire field the snorting chargers stamping , fighting their tight reins and veering left and right and the plains are bristling a jagged crop of iron spears , everywhere , fields ablaze with weapons brandished high
1	even those who would kept to the beached ships till now , the helmsmen who handled the heavy steering-oars and stewards left on board to deal out rations — even they trooped to the muster : great achilles who held back from the brutal fighting so long had just come blazing forth
1	shedding his wings he masquerades as iulus , prancing with his stride
1	to the right it runs below the mighty walls of death , our path to elysium , but the left-hand road torments the wicked , leading down to tartarus , path to doom
1	such vistas the god of fire forged across the shield that venus gives her son
1	what an indignity for us to clash in arms
1	i will speak out what the heart inside me urges
1	so with the spear patroclus gaffed him off his car , his mouth gaping round the glittering point and flipped him down facefirst , dead as he fell , his life breath blown away
1	always your pleasure , whenever my back is turned , to settle things in your grand clandestine way
1	will no one rush to arms , come streaming out of the whole city , hunt him down , race to the docks and launch the ships ?
1	hear me , turn your power my way , attend my sorrows— i deserve your mercy—hear my prayers !
1	seeing him there the swift achilles filled with pity , rose in their midst and said these winging words : the best man drives his purebred team home last !
1	what could light such a conflagration ?
1	but cronus ' son , zeus with his shield of storm insists on embroiling me in painful struggles , futile wars of words
1	disaster seized him — his fine legs buckling — he stood there , senseless — and now , right at his back , close-up , a dardan fighter speared him squarely between the shoulder blades with a sharp lance
1	immortal horses they are , poseidon gave them himself to my father peleus , peleus passed them on to me
1	you will learn too , in tears — easier game you will be for argive troops to slaughter , now my hector 's dead
1	and come , my people , celebrate with all good will this feast that makes us one !
1	and once they ’ d devoured all in sight , still not sated , their hunger drove them on to attack the fateful plates themselves , their hands and teeth defiling , ripping into the thin dry crusts , never sparing a crumb of the flat-bread scored in quarters
1	you keep your family mourners near to cart you off — once my fists have worked you down to pulp !
1	the other gods kept clear , at their royal ease , reclining off in the halls where the roofs of each were built for the ages high on rugged ridged olympus
1	god save our earth from such a scourge !
1	aides caught his team , sthenelus , loyal eurymedon , as the two commanders boarded diomedes ' car
1	he kept his watch , enthralled by the rush of battle , aloft the summit of timbered samos facing thrace
1	now , suddenly , battle thrilled them more than the journey home , than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land
1	with one accord the trojans roared assent : give the man the prize that he ’ d been promised
1	oh make me young again , and the strength inside me steady as a rock !
1	trusting these , they followed their chief to troy , shooting with these , salvo on pelting salvo , they tore the trojan battle lines to pieces
1	while i in our cursed bridal chamber , there i lay , bone-weary with anguish , buried deep in sleep , peaceful , sweet , like the peace of death itself
1	you are eager for bed now , burning to make love , here on ida 's heights for all the world to see ?
1	but the whole plain filled with men and flashed with bronze , with troops and horse and beneath their feet the earth quaked as armies rushed together
1	zeus saved you then and other gods joined in
1	look on us kindly , see the state we are in
1	never a word that works to my advantage !
1	at once aeneas invites all those who wish to contend with winging shafts and names the prizes
1	idomeneus called his comrades , glancing fast at ascalaphus , aphareus , deipyrus , meriones and antilochus , both strong with the war cry — he called them closer , his winging orders flying : over here , my friends !
1	but no , it was not the gallant odysseus ' fate to finish zeus 's rugged son with his sharp bronze , so pallas swung his fury against the lycian front
1	turnus begs you with all his heart , dash this ship on a reef or cliff or run her aground on the syrtes ’ savage shoals where no rutulian , no rumor that knows my shame can dog my heels !
1	so the herald shouted , stirring machaon 's spirit
1	something to shield and save our men and ships since zeus 's heart has turned — his mighty heart is set on hector 's offerings more than ours
1	my blood runs cold , my body ’ s chill , played out
1	so , exceeding our hopes , we win our way to solid ground at last
1	here is the man , he ’ s here !
1	mothers struck with terror pray and re-echo prayers , the fear builds as the deadly peril comes closer , the specter of war looms larger , ever larger
1	he tried to hoist great ajax , budged him a little off the ground , true , but he could not heave him clear , then hooked him round a knee and down they sprawled together , both men clenched in a death-lock , tussling round in dust
1	while they consecrated the tomb with various games , saturnian juno hurries iris down from the sky to the trojan fleet , breathing gusts at her back to wing her on her way
1	hovering at his head the phantom rose and spoke : sleeping , achilles ?
1	he stopped the pains at once , stanched the dark blood in his throbbing wound and filled his heart with courage
1	he calls for his horse , his pride , his mainstay , always the mount he rode triumphant from every battle
1	but the shrewd tactician kept on pressing : be precise
1	reveal the will of god , whatever you may know
1	but against them zeus impelled the trojan ranks as menelaus lord of the war cry urged antilochus , none of the younger troops , antilochus , none is faster of foot than you or tougher in combat — why not leap right in and lay some trojan out ?
1	the crowd cheered on both , they took both sides , but heralds held them back as the city elders sat on polished stone benches , forming the sacred circle , grasping in hand the staffs of clear-voiced heralds , and each leapt to his feet to plead the case in turn
1	the veteran pelagon , one of his closest aides , pushed the shaft of ashwood out through his wound — his spirit left him — a mist poured down his eyes
1	there the father of men and gods reined in his team , set them free and around them poured a dense mist
1	but you — the son of cronus with cronus ' twisting ways gave you gifts by halves : with that royal scepter the father gave you honor beyond all other men alive but he never gave you courage , the greatest power of all
1	cebriones followed close , third in command since hector left another to rein his team , a driver less than cebriones , less a fighter
1	when a man stands up to speak , it 's well to listen
1	and zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied , courage , athena , third-born of the gods , dear child
1	leaving a few behind , we launch out from crete , deserting another home , and set our sails again , scudding on buoyant hulls through wastes of ocean
1	savage allecto , high on a lookout , spots her chance to wreak some havoc
1	and all the while that matchless wife of mine is removing all my weapons from the house , even slipping my trusty sword from under my pillow
1	this one volunteered among the trojans : hector , the mission stirs my fighting blood — i will reconnoiter the ships and gather all i can
1	there , a total stranger , the horseman tydeus had no fear , alone in the midst of theban hordes
1	ajax next — with a lunge he stabbed phorcys , phaenops ' warrior son bestriding hippothous ' corpse — he ripped his belly , smashing the corslet just where the plates join and the bronze spearhead spilled his entrails out and down went phorcys , grasping , clawing the dust
1	quick in the jolting onset lycia 's captain glaucus son of hippolochus skewered dexius ' son iphinous just as he leapt behind his fast mares — he stabbed his shoulder , hard , and down from his car iphinous crashed to earth and his limbs went slack with death
1	quick as a thought goes flashing through a man who 's traveled the world — ah to be there , or there !
1	i think i can claim to have some years on you
1	the horse stands towering high in the heart of troy , disgorging its armed men , with sinon in his glory , gloating over us—sinon fans the fires
1	spirits high with the sign , the argive armies cheered
1	no holding back for the bodies of the fallen : once they are gone , let fire soothe them quickly
1	let bygones be bygones
1	daring beyond your powers !
1	but you keep on presiding over the gods , themis , the feasting in the halls
1	patroclus obeyed his great friend , who put down a heavy chopping block in the firelight and across it laid a sheep 's chine , a fat goat 's and the long back cut of a full-grown pig , marbled with lard
1	even now cassandra revealed the future , opening lips the gods had ruled no trojan would believe
1	stretching hands to the gods a man would murmur , scanning the wide sky , father zeus , let ajax win , or tydeus ' son or the proud king himself of all mycenae 's gold !
1	and you , you make for the xanthus banks and burn the trees , hurl the stream itself into conflagration — not for a moment let him turn you back with his winning words or threats
1	here young boys and girls , beauties courted with costly gifts of oxen , danced and danced , linking their arms , gripping each other 's wrists
1	so he shouted , lashing the rage and fighting-fury in every trojan
1	nor did his team go long without a master , hector found one quickly — iphitus ' daring son , archeptolemus — mounted him up behind his racers , thrust the reins in the fighting driver 's hands
1	the shepherd among his flock , hauling his massive hulk , groping toward the shore he knew by heart
1	and next achilles lunged at demoleon , son of antenor , a tough defensive fighter — he stabbed his temple and cleft his helmet 's cheekpiece
1	antenor flanked him , mounting the gleaming car , and both men drove the team through the scaean gates , heading toward the plain
1	so the red-haired captain backed away from patroclus ' corpse but wheeled at bay when he reached his waiting allies , glancing round and round for ajax ' massive hulk
1	juno whips her on with a challenge like a lash : do me this service , virgin daughter of night , a labor just for me !
1	you are goddesses , you remember it all , and you can tell it all— all we catch is the distant ring of fame
1	he commands you to quit the war and slaughter now , go back to the tribes of gods or down to your bright sea !
1	sons of achaea , stop your salvos !
1	achilles had thrust it forth with his strong fist , fearing staunch aeneas ' spear with its long shadow would drive its whole length lightly through his buckler — groundless fears
1	out they rushed , the sentries in armor , forming under the son of nestor , captain thrasymedes , under ascalaphus , ialmenus , sons of ares , under meriones , aphareus and deipyrus , under the son of creon , trusty lycomedes
1	but just now my wife was bringing me round , her winning words urging me back to battle
1	i am your suppliant , prince , you must respect me !
1	he was on his way for a new bronze spear to use and staunch idomeneus shouted out , meriones — racing son of molus , brother-in-arms , old friend , why back from the lines , why leave the fight behind ?
1	— hector , his helmet flashing , called out to her — dearest of all my brothers , all these warring years , of all the sons that priam and hecuba produced !
1	so now they press on with their journey under way and at last approach the river
1	three times he charged , frenzied to bring him down , three times apollo battered his gleaming shield back — then at tydides ' fourth assault like something superhuman , the archer who strikes from worlds away shrieked out — a voice of terror — think , diomedes , shrink back now !
1	and the mighty god , stirred to his depths , lifts his head from the crests and serene in power , gazing out over all his realm , he sees aeneas ’ squadrons scattered across the ocean , trojans overwhelmed by the surf and the wild crashing skies
1	why , he 's erected a rampart , driven a trench around it , broad , enormous , and planted stakes to guard it
1	but great telamonian ajax spurred his argives on : be men , my friends !
1	but now the brilliant runner achilles watched and marked him — there he stood on the stern of his looming hollow hull , looking out over the uphill work and heartsick rout of war
1	i will swear , what 's more , never to drive the fatal day away from the trojans , not even when all troy burns in the ramping flames when the warring sons of achaea burn her down !
1	then and there menelaus might have stripped euphorbus and swept the trojan 's glittering armor off with ease so if apollo had not grudged him all that glory , rousing hector against him , swift as ares
1	and a throng of monsters too—what brutal forms are stabled at the gates—centaurs , mongrel scyllas , part women , part beasts , and hundred-handed briareus and the savage hydra of lerna , that hissing horror , the chimaera armed with torches—gorgons , harpies and triple-bodied geryon , his great ghost
1	shaft poised , he hurled and its long shadow flew and it struck tydides ' shield , the brazen spearhead winging , drilling right on through to his breastplate , pandarus yelling over him wildly now , you are hit — clean through the side !
1	fight — the light of safety lies in our fighting hands , not spines gone soft in battle !
1	may these galleys never be wrecked on any passage out or overpowered by whirling storms at sea , let their birth on our mountains be a blessing !
1	come , call up whatever courage you can muster
1	now acestes alone remained , and his prize lost
1	now give them glory , if only a moment 's glory — long as zeus still slumbers
1	have no fear of an argive ambush packed with danger — achilles vowed , when he sent me home from the black ships , not to do us harm till the twelfth dawn arrives
1	true , but the queen— who can delude a lover ? —soon caught wind of a plot afoot , the first to sense the trojans are on the move
1	ajax suddenly spun a glinting spear at polydamas , fast , but the trojan dodged black fate himself with a quick spring to the side — but antenor 's son archelochus caught the shaft for the gods had doomed that fighting man to death
1	his armies roared assent
1	i carry aboard my ships the gods of house and home we seized from enemy hands
1	with that the son of cronus caught his wife in his arms and under them now the holy earth burst with fresh green grass , crocus and hyacinth , clover soaked with dew , so thick and soft it lifted their bodies off the hard , packed ground
1	now it ’ s only a bay , a treacherous cove for ships
1	but not quite finished yet
1	they even impale the heads on brandished pikes , the heads—a grisly sight—and strut behind them , baiting them with outcries
1	who will revere the power of juno after this— lay gifts on my altar , lift his hands in prayer ?
1	only helenor and lycus slip to safety , just—helenor still in the flush of youth
1	he spurned their offer , firmly , even swore an oath : no , no , by zeus — by the highest , greatest god !
1	each of you get a grip on yourself — where 's your pride , your soldier 's sense of shame ?
1	we who have drunk deep of each and every disaster land and sea can offer
1	you ’ d think the cyclades ripped up by the roots , afloat on the swells , or mountains ramming against mountains , so immense the turrets astern as sailors attack them , showering flaming tow and hot bolts of flying steel , and the fresh blood running red on neptune ’ s fields
1	thundering zeus has spread his hands above her
1	so you , achilles — great godlike achilles — i made you my son , i tried , so someday you might fight disaster off my back
1	breaking off , andromache wept , her wailing filled the grove , inconsolable
1	decreeing triumph for us , not for the argives now
1	sthenelus checked his own racers clear of the crash of battle , lashed them tight to his chariot-rails with reins then dashed for aeneas ' glossy full-maned team and drove them out of the trojan lines and into his
1	but time and again , as they were setting sail , the heavy seas would keep them confined to port and the southwind filled their hearts with dread and worst of all , once this horse , this mass of timber with locking planks , stood stationed here at last , the thunderheads rumbled up and down the sky
1	stand up , look for yourselves !
1	now for orontes , hardy soldier , now for amycus , now for the brutal fate that lycus may have met , then gyas and brave cloanthus , hearts of oak
1	the troops sprang up , scattered back to the ships , lit fires beside their tents and took their meal
1	that wand in his grip he flew , the mighty giant-killer touching down on troy and the hellespont in no time and from there he went on foot , for all the world like a young prince , sporting his first beard , just in the prime and fresh warm pride of youth
1	once he sees there is no running away from battle , no turning aside camilla ’ s attack , he tries to devise a ruse with all his craft and cunning , letting loose : now where ’ s the glory , tell me , a woman putting her trust in a powerful horse ?
1	just that moment the ithacan haled the prophet , calchas , into our midst—he ’ d twist it out of him , what was the gods ’ will ?
1	how he would dote on her and spurn his wedded wife , my own mother !
1	who will take him on ?
1	you have hoards of gold in your tents , bronze , sheep , serving-girls by the score and purebred racers too : pick some bigger trophy out of the whole lot and hand it on to the man , but do it later — or now , at once , and win your troops ' applause
1	no , with a prayer to zeus some new fighting power had filled his dark heart and he quickly called his trusted friend alcimedon : alcimedon , keep those horses close beside me , breathing down my neck
1	he marked him quickly , out on the left flank and rousing cohorts , driving them back to war , and the red-haired captain halted near and called , turn this way , antilochus , prince , and hear the news , dreadful news — would to god it had never happened !
1	so he said and walking on ahead , from high above points out to them open country swept with light
1	so you can win great honor , great glory for me in the eyes of all the argive ranks , and they , they will send her back , my lithe and lovely girl , and top it off with troves of glittering gifts
1	for me to unite my daughter with any one of her former suitors would have been wrong , forbidden : all the gods and prophets made that plain
1	deluge all your channels from all your gushing springs — muster all your torrents — raise up a tremendous wave , rumbling , booming with timber , boulders crashing — we will stop this wild man in his tracks , lording it in his power now and raging like some god !
1	but the queen , afraid of the new rules of engagement , wept , and bent on her own death embraced her ardent son-in-law to be : turnus , by these tears of mine , by any concern for amata that moves your heart , you are my only hope , now , you the one relief to my wretched old age
1	not until you do will the great jaws of our spellbound house gape wide
1	together they recognize the trophies of war— messapus ’ burnished helmet and many emblems retrieved with so much sweat
1	aeneas , soon as his eyes drank in that plunder—keepsake of his own savage grief—flaring up in fury , terrible in his rage , he cries : decked in the spoils you stripped from one i loved—escape my clutches ?
1	such a long hard labor it was to found the roman people
1	and the dog star scorched the green fields barren , the grasses shriveled , blighted crops refused us food
1	then both went thrashing into the lines to make a slaughter as two wild boars bristling , ramping back for the kill , fling themselves on the yelping packs that hunt them — back they whirled on attack and laid the trojans low while achaeans just in flight from hector 's onset leapt at the chance to gather second wind
1	with camilla ’ s last words she lost her grip on the reins and , all against her will , slipped down to the ground
1	achilles , put some human kindness in your heart
1	flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the house of death , wailing his fate , leaving his manhood far behind , his young and supple strength
1	we few escaped and floated toward your coast
1	but how bitter the first fruits of a man ’ s youth , the hard lessons learned in a war so near at hand , and none of the gods would hear my vows , my prayers
1	but priam 's son prince hector and royal odysseus measured off the ground for single combat first , then dropped two stones in a helmet , lots for casting — who would be first to hurl his bronze-tipped spear ?
1	and with each word he points to the sopping muck that fouled his face and limbs
1	you would soon feel his force , that man you robbed of his sumptuous , warm wife
1	up with you — fast !
1	not a single god can stand against you — no , not i — ca not fight such fire , such fury — hold your attack , stop !
1	inside , panic , chaos , soldiers fighting to find some way out of the flames—no hope
1	even for generations still to come , to learn that achaean armies so strong , so vast , fought a futile war
1	she fears everything now , even with all secure
1	menacing so as brilliant achilles raised the pelian ash spear but the fighting asteropaeus , quick , ambidextrous , hurled both spears at once — one shaft hit the shield , no breakthrough , the shaft could not smash through , the gold blocked it , forged in the god 's gift
1	so come , follow my orders
1	if you had sprung from another god , believe me , and grown into such a blinding devastation , long ago you would have dropped below the titans , deep in the dark pit
1	spurring her on , juno left juturna torn , distraught with the wound that broke her heart
1	to suffer greater blows ?
1	so i , i took it into my head to lay him low with sharp bronze !
1	despite my anguish i will beat it down , the fury mounting inside me , down by force
1	teucer was first to kill his man , a son of mentor , breeder of stallions , the rugged spearman imbrius
1	bear with me now
1	my hand will shield you in war today and guide you toward the great rewards
1	but who believed a trojan expedition could reach italian shores ?
1	down from the gods you came to waylay me — you seduced me blind
1	welcome them to your camp as allies , seal your pacts
1	italy-bound we were when , surging with sudden breakers stormy orion drove us against blind shoals and from the south came vicious gales to scatter us , whelmed by the sea , across the murderous surf and rocky barrier reefs
1	but not without jury picked by lot , not without judge are their places handed down
1	it all began when artemis throned in gold loosed a disaster on them , incensed that oeneus offered her no first fruits , his orchard 's crowning glory
1	here greeks in flight , routed by troy ’ s young ranks , there trojans routed by plumed achilles in his chariot
1	rolling her up in cork-bark stripped from trees , he lashed her fast to the weapon , just mid-haft and balancing both in his right hand , he prays to the skies : bountiful one , to you , lover of groves , latona ’ s daughter , a father devotes his baby girl
1	he fetched and tethered a heavy-duty mule in the ring , six years old , unbroken — the hardest kind to break — and offered the loser a cup with double handles
1	with that and with all his might the old man flings his spear— but too impotent now to pierce , it merely grazes pyrrhus ’ brazen shield that blocks its way and clings there , dangling limp from the boss , all for nothing
1	look , we will make you a promise — we will keep it too
1	before patroclus met his day of destiny , true , it warmed my heart a bit to spare some trojans : droves i took alive and auctioned off as slaves
1	but still the gods forbid an italian commander to lead a race so great— choose leaders from overseas !
1	lords of the argives , o my captains !
1	you want the men to grieve for the dead by starving ?
1	he was the one , in fact , who ordered , pressed me on to reach your doors and seek you , beg you now
1	why , not even ares the deathless god of war , not even athena — for all their heavy labor — could hack a passage through such jaws of battle
1	their hunger sated , the tables cleared away , they talk on for hours , asking after their missing shipmates—wavering now between hope and fear : what to believe about the rest ?
1	now surely i have never probed or pried in the past
1	he raised back the carved lids of the chests and lifted out twelve robes , handsome , rich brocades , twelve cloaks , unlined and light , as many blankets , as many big white capes and shirts to go with them
1	if wind-swift iris had not swept from olympus bearing her message — peleus ' son must arm — but all unknown to zeus and the other gods since hera spurred her on
1	this shrine is their senate , this the site of their sacred banquets
1	so hector commanded his trojans , sounding out , now storm the ships !
1	such pains the blissful gods are lavishing on your son , dead man though he is — the gods love him dearly !
1	and wrap your brow with the holy bands
1	they had in hand a bolt they had just hammered out , one of the countless bolts the father rains on earth from the arching sky—part buffed already , part still rough
1	and following on that blow he seizes his dazed foe ’ s locks in his left hand and pins him fast to the ground with a knee full force and digs his rigid blade in ebysus ’ flank
1	did not we all hear his plan in secret council ?
1	even the gods themselves can bend and change , and theirs is the greater power , honor , strength
1	mother tells me , the immortal goddess thetis with her glistening feet , that two fates bear me on to the day of death
1	andromache grieves no less at our final parting
1	you can all turn to earth and water — rot away !
1	my heart tells me , my ears ring with the din of drumming hoofs
1	and once we would had our fill of food and drink , i led off with our plan , inviting the two of you to come campaign with us
1	if only the god would share the smoky savor of lambs and full-grown goats , apollo might be willing , still , somehow , to save us from this plague
1	the splendor of heroes , and he shot up like a young branch , like a fine tree i reared him — the orchard 's crowning glory — but only to send him off in the beaked ships to troy to battle trojans !
1	teach me the way , throw wide the sacred doors !
1	or let him take still more , piling up his kills ?
1	our people will live in peace on the rich soil of troy , our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of argos , the land of achaea where the women are a wonder
1	go at once to the camp , give your son this order : tell him the gods are angry with him now and i am rising over them all in deathless wrath that he in heartsick fury still holds hector 's body , there by his beaked ships , and will not give him back — perhaps in fear of me he will give him back at once
1	he thrilled to have it and spoke out winging words : true , true , my son , all of it , right on the mark
1	but turnus is dead against their joining up with the trojan camp
1	she broke off , her left hand seizing both wrists of the goddess , right hand stripping the bow and quiver off her shoulders — hera boxed the huntress ' ears with her own weapons , smiling broadly now as her victim writhed away and showering arrows scattered
1	thetis would ask a favor of you !
1	but if your battles teach you to hope in arms , the arms you buckle on , your first duty should be to guard our house
1	heralds brought the water at once and rinsed their hands , and the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all
1	he had not laid a hand on his black benched hull , such anguish racked his heart and fighting spirit
1	in panic we rush to escape , get clear of his reach , take aboard the fugitive—he had earned his way— and we cut our lines , dead quiet , put our backs in a racing stroke that makes the waters churn
1	long years had brought their fighting days to a halt but they were eloquent speakers still , clear as cicadas settled on treetops , lifting their voices through the forest , rising softly , falling , dying away
1	and we your celebrants firm in our faith , we plant our feet in your embers glowing hot !
1	and the old man burned these over dried split wood and over the quarters poured out glistening wine while young men at his side held five-pronged forks
1	or pacts between both armies ?
1	and anguish seized menelaus lord of the war cry
1	come , spin him round in his tracks and drive him back
1	now , in any event , swift achilles makes it his turning-post
1	and rouse the rest of your armies !
1	quickly notching the sharp arrow on the string he swore to apollo , wolf-god , glorious archer , he would slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs when he marched home to zelea 's sacred city
1	what if one of the deathless gods observes us , sleeping together , yes — and runs off to the rest and points us out to all ?
1	now , all in a mass , drive hard against them — rousing battering war against these stallion-breaking trojans !
1	— a crashing attack — and a pair of ramping lions had seized a bull from the cattle 's front ranks — he bellowed out as they dragged him off in agony
1	elated and making way through crowds of troops he found the two called ajax , great and little , both captains armed for attack with a cloud of infantry forming up behind them
1	iron inside your chest , that heart of yours
1	as achaeans and trojans wondered what was coming , athena merged in the trojan columns like a fighter , like antenor 's son the rugged spearman laodocus , hunting for pandarus , hoping to find the archer
1	he knew all things that are , all things that are past and all that are to come , the seer who had led the argive ships to troy with the second sight that god apollo gave him
1	aeneas came up first with long , menacing strides , head tossing his heavy helmet , his charging shield thrust out to defend his chest , and shook his bronze spear
1	they will sweep us back to the city , back to safety if zeus hands tydeus ' son the glory once again
1	why do not you get my wagon ready — now , at once ?
1	tell her to hurry , sprinkle herself with river water , bring the victims marked for the sacrifice i must make
1	so come , do as i say , and let us all unite
1	and the first latins to rush through the open gates ?
1	up stood polypoetes , always braced for battle , leonteus flanked him , strong , intense as a god , then telamon 's son great ajax , lord epeus too
1	the brilliant runner achilles lay among his ships , raging over briseis , the girl with lustrous hair , the prize he seized from lyrnessus — after he had fought to exhaustion at lyrnessus , storming the heights , and breached the walls of thebes and toppled the vaunting spearmen epistrophus and mynes , sons of king euenus , selepius ' son
1	take my words to aeneas , hardly words to please that craven phrygian king !
1	true , they have labored long — they are desperate for home
1	there he huddles before his curving , beaked ships , racked with grief for his dear friend while others scatter , settling down to their meal
1	with that , he wreathes his brows with a leafy green spray and prays to the spirit of the place , and earth , first of the gods , and nymphs and rivers still unknown , and then to the night and the rising stars of night
1	you look so harried
1	i ’ ll add this too , if i can depend on your good will : with rumors i will draw the border towns into war , ignite their hearts with a maddening lust for battle
1	oenotrians settled it ; now we hear their descendants call their kingdom italy , after their leader , italus
1	my own flesh and blood !
1	they held their attack
1	and the knees of every trojan shook with fear , each veteran frantic , glancing left and right — how to escape his sudden , plunging death ?
1	touched by love for his own father , this image stirred his heart
1	so come then , listen , as i count out the gifts , the troves in his tents that agamemnon vows to give you
1	my shipmates strip and glistening sleek with oil , wrestle the old trojan way , our spirits high— we ’ d skimmed past such a flurry of argive cities , holding true to our flight through waters held by foes
1	never once did my altar lack its share of victims , winecups tipped and the deep smoky savor
1	is that why you order me to give her back ?
1	think what a city you will see , my sister , what a kingdom rising high if you marry such a man !
1	oh , you can whisk aeneas clear of the clutches of the greeks , in place of a man puff up some vapid fume of air !
1	a band of loyal followers rushed to help him , led him out of the ring , his feet dragging , head lolling to one side , spitting clots of blood
1	come , please , sit down on this chair here
1	just for the sake of rivalry , soldier 's pride , do not rush to fight with a better man , with hector the son of priam
1	no , this is the pleasure of overweening zeus , it seems — to kill the achaeans here , our memory blotted out a world away from argos
1	but above all , tragic dido , doomed to a plague about to strike , can not feast her eyes enough , thrilled both by the boy and gifts he brings and the more she looks the more the fire grows
1	but i defeated fate , a father doomed to outlive his son
1	at once aeneas , limbs limp in the chill of fear , groans and lifting both his palms toward the stars cries out : three , four times blest , my comrades lucky to die beneath the soaring walls of troy— before their parents ’ eyes !
1	there oeneus stayed , on his own native soil , but father wandered far , driven to live in argos
1	but the mighty god of earthquakes was not blind
1	mostly slingers spraying pellets of livid lead , some brandish a pair of lances , all heads cowled with tawny wolfskin caps , their left feet planted , making a naked print , their right feet shod with a rugged rawhide boot
1	no one saw them at first , neither man nor woman , none before cassandra , golden as goddess aphrodite
1	go no further down the road of hatred
1	at any moment he will storm king priam 's mighty stronghold down — the trojans ca not stand up to the man in battle
1	hovering at his head the escort rose and spoke : not a care in the world , old man ?
1	they know right from wrong
1	dragging his fine chariot , flogging his team before him
1	then my cheeks still sported the bloom of youth and i was full of wonder to see the chiefs of troy , wonder to see laomedon ’ s son , priam himself , no doubt , but one walked taller than all the rest—anchises
1	you have slaughtered centaurs born of the clouds , half man , half horse , hylaeus and pholus—the bull , the monster of crete , the tremendous nemean lion holed in his rocky den
1	but turnus , think , he ’ ll rise on the wings of fame to meet the gods , gods on whose altars he has offered up his life : he will live forever , sung on the lips of men !
1	some little aeneas playing about our halls , whose features at least would bring you back to me in spite of all , i would not feel so totally devastated , so destroyed
1	he rode to war as well , virbius , striking son of hippolytus , sent to fight by his mother aricia : virbius in his triumph , bred in egeria ’ s grove that rings the marshy banks where diana ’ s altar stands , rich with victims fit to win her favor
1	hera , hera , queen of the gods and daughter of mighty cronus — any other immortal god who lives forever , believe me , i would put to sleep in a wink , even the rolling tides of the great ocean river , the fountainhead that brought them all to birth
1	lynceus swings to attack , shouting his comrades on—but first from the right-hand rampart turnus spins with one stroke of his dazzling sword , close-up , that brings down lynceus , slashes his head off , head and helmet tumbling far away
1	even here , merit will have its true reward
1	no need for you to tell it
1	no more trading your stinging insults now , ajax , idomeneus !
1	and never sated with fighting ?
1	then dipping sweet nectar up from the mixing bowl he poured it round to all the immortals , left to right
1	this altar will shield us all or else you ’ ll die with us
1	trust me , this fame of ours will offer us some haven
1	the heavens call for me
1	juno stopped , transfixed with anguish , then , shaking her head , this exclamation came pouring from her heart : that cursed race i loathe—their phrygian fate that clashes with my own !
1	if what you say is true , that must be my pleasure
1	let me look at your face , my son , exchange some words , and hear your familiar voice
1	mine is the duty to follow your commands
1	roving the forests , home to the well-known door it came , all on its own , even at dead of night
1	right of the whole engagement , work the center or go at the left flank ?
1	turnus at this point , fighting off on the outskirts of the field , is hunting a few stragglers
1	the lord of the war cry told the goddess quickly , phoenix , father , good old soldier — if only pallas would give me power and drive the weapons off me !
1	and once he would thrilled his heart with looking hard at the armor 's well-wrought beauty , he turned to his mother , winged words flying : mother — armor sent by the god — you are right , only immortal gods could forge such work , no man on earth could ever bring it off !
1	i have just splintered the lance i used to carry , smashed it against his shield — swaggering deiphobus
1	three great strides he took , on the fourth he reached his goal , aegae port where his famous halls are built in the green depths , the shimmering golden halls of the god that stand forever
1	but the fiery runner achilles burst out in anger , why , roan beauty — why prophesy my doom ?
1	do not dismiss their appeal , their expedition here — though no one could blame your anger , not before
1	with that the brilliant achilles ordered friends to set a large three-legged cauldron over the fire and wash the clotted blood from patroclus ' wounds with all good speed
1	gods , beat back disaster !
1	first he seizes phaleris , cuts the knees from under gyges— snatching their spears he whips them into the backs of men who break and run as juno builds his courage , his war-lust
1	the phantom sifting through his fingers , light as wind , quick as a dream in flight
1	i have founded a noble city , seen my ramparts rise
1	so now you harness the racing team for us while i go into the halls of storming zeus and buckle on my gear and arm for combat
1	aeneas fixes the crests still dripping blood , the enemy ’ s splintered spears and breastplate battered hard and pierced in a dozen places
1	so if die she must , she ’ ll leave no way untried
1	or if some care for a parent ’ s grief can touch you still , i pray you—you had such a father , in old anchises— pity daunus in his old age and send me back to my own people , or if you would prefer , send them my dead body stripped of life
1	ulysses has seen the cyclops on mount etna
1	no reason to fear that prophecy , the horror of eating your own platters
1	racked with agony , her glowing flesh blood-dark
1	an aide saw them and put some oxhides down
1	or me , and the destiny that weighs me down , your widow , now so soon ?
1	this man on horseback , he will steady the roman state when rocked by chaos , mow the carthaginians down in droves , the rebel gauls
1	now you ’ re in turnus ’ hands
1	he seethes on a heaving sea as warring anxieties call him back and forth
1	if the argives roll us back away from the ships , trapped and tangled there in the yawning trench , no runner , i tell you , pressed by an argive rally , could struggle free and bear the news to troy
1	you have a heart of iron !
1	oh make me young again , and the strength inside me steady as a rock !
1	in the same breath , shining hector reached down for his son — but the boy recoiled , cringing against his nurse 's full breast , screaming out at the sight of his own father , terrified by the flashing bronze , the horsehair crest , the great ridge of the helmet nodding , bristling terror — so it struck his eyes
1	a disaster 's right upon us
1	back diomedes jumped on his car and told his driver to make for the hollow ships — tydides racked with pain
1	that woman spawns her plots , mulling over some desperate outrage in her heart , lashing her surging rage , she ’ s bent on death
1	that ’ s what the wind demands , says good aeneas
1	so wounded eurypylus pleaded , friends around him crowding , bracing shields against their shoulders , spears brandished high and back to the bulking front came giant ajax now
1	the two immortals stepped briskly as wild doves , quivering , keen to defend the fighting men of argos
1	where can he run ?
1	but once he would swallowed down the sparrow with her brood , the son of crooked cronus who sent the serpent forth turned him into a sign , a monument clear to see — zeus struck him to stone !
1	don ’ t hold me back
1	would jove want one city to hold the tyrians and the trojan exiles ?
1	a man 's tongue is a glib and twisty thing
1	do not lay hand to sword
1	at last he would leap to his feet , wander in anguish , aimless along the surf , and dawn on dawn flaming over the sea and shore would find him pacing
1	aeneas keeps down , huddling under his own shield , enraged
1	you , the bravest of all achaeans — and not one with the spine to battle hector face-to-face !
1	at last the trojan captains hear of the massacre of their troops
1	is there any trace of antheus now , tossed by the gales , or his warships banked with oars ?
1	but then , once he received that fatal message sent from his own daughter 's husband , first he ordered bellerophon to kill the chimaera — grim monster sprung of the gods , nothing human , all lion in front , all snake behind , all goat between , terrible , blasting lethal fire at every breath !
1	and give me your own fine armor to buckle on my back , so the trojans might take me for you , achilles , yes , hold off from attack , and achaea 's fighting sons get second wind , exhausted as they are
1	what if atrides agamemnon learns you are here — what if the whole achaean army learns you are here ?
1	but i — whatever fists and feet and strength can do , that i will do , i swear , not hang back , not one inch
1	quick , run to achilles ' moorings up the beach and tell him all
1	first to confront him ?
1	the two aeantes , old campaigners , volunteered , meriones volunteered and nestor 's son leapt up and menelaus the famous spearman volunteered and battle-hardened odysseus too , to foray into the trojan units camped for the night — odysseus ' blood was always up for exploit
1	soon as the sun came up in flames above the earth we joined battle , lifting a prayer to zeus and pallas
1	but the god who grips the earth restrained the queen : hera , so hard , so senseless !
1	with that challenge both went soaring home to the deathless ones on high but achilles rampaged on with the gods ' strong command driving him down the plain where the river flooded now , an immense , cresting outrush bursting with burnished gear and troops of battle dead , men cut down in their prime , floating corpses rolling — but achilles surged on too with high hurdling strides , charging against the river , on , breakneck on and the river could not stop him , not for all its reach and tide race , not with athena pumping enormous strength deep down achilles ' heart — but the xanthus river would not slack his fury either , he raged at achilles all the more , he marshaled up a mountainous ridge of water , roaring out to simois , oh dear brother , rise !
1	from there , i have heard , a massylian priestess comes who tended the temple held by hesperian daughters
1	then is the time to clash in hatred , then to ravage each other
1	it is not the will of fate that the proud trojans ' citadel fall before your spear , not even before achilles — far greater man than you !
1	and telamonian ajax joined him , calling out , i can feel it too , now , the hands on my spear , invincible hands quivering tense for battle , look — the power rising within me , feet beneath me rushing me on !
1	they pressed us hard , they begged us to give them battle-tested allies
1	who is that , father , matching marcellus stride for stride ?
1	magnificent paris brought those women back himself from sidon , sailing the open seas on the same long voyage he swept helen off , her famous father 's child
1	for now is the seventh summer that has borne you wandering all the lands and seas on earth
1	not too proud now
1	he spun on his heels and left them there in place , heading for other ranks and came on nestor next , the clear speaker of pylos posting troops , readying them for action , combat units forming under the lanky pelagon , alastor and chromius , haemon and stocky bias , skilled captain of armies
1	think of apollo leaving his lycian haunts and xanthus in winter spate , he ’ s out to visit delos , his mother ’ s isle , and strike up the dance again while round the altars swirls a growing throng of cretans , dryopians , agathyrsians with tattoos , and a drumming roar goes up as the god himself strides the cynthian ridge , his streaming hair braided with pliant laurel leaves entwined in twists of gold , and arrows clash on his shoulders
1	but not the trojans , no
1	there ’ s a place for mischief— we ’ ve seen it ourselves—an open fork in the road , at the gate that fronts the coast
1	now , though , if you really want me to fight to the finish here , have all trojans and argives take their seats and pit me against menelaus dear to ares — right between the lines — we will fight it out for helen and all her wealth
1	it should have then , when you offered him your scepter
1	i come to you from the nightmare furies ’ den , i brandish war and death in my right hand !
1	glancing around he spots a huge rock , huge , ages old , and lying out in the field by chance , placed as a boundary stone to settle border wars
1	sergestus , who gives his name to the sergian house , rides the tremendous vessel centaur
1	meanwhile dawn rose up and left her ocean bed and soon as her rays have lit the sky , an elite band of young huntsmen streams out through the gates , bearing the nets , wide-meshed or tight for traps and their hunting spears with broad iron heads , troops of massylian horsemen galloping hard , packs of powerful hounds , keen on the scent
1	and droves of fat sheep and shambling crook-horned cattle they led before the pyre , skinned and dressed them well
1	if any other achaean had told us of this dream we would call it false and turn our backs upon it
1	and his heart melted now like the dew that wets the corn when the fresh stalks rise up and the ripe fields ripple — so the heart in your chest was melted now , menelaus , and you gave your friend an answer , winged words : antilochus , now it is my turn to yield to you , for all my mounting anger
1	this is his one reply that ’ s played me false : he swore you would cross the ocean safe and sound and reach italian shores
1	you do not look right or left
1	back i went to my people and i was amazed to see what throngs of new companions had poured in to swell our numbers , mothers , men , our forces gathered for exile , grieving masses
1	all the more fiercely trojans swarm him , war cries breaking , ranks packed tight as a band of huntsmen bristling spears , attacking a savage lion
1	so apollo ’ s aged priestess ended her answer , then she added : come , press on with your journey
1	but never would he repay his loving parents now for the gift of rearing — his life cut short so soon , brought down by the spear of lionhearted ajax
1	fiercer still , the monstrous hydra , fifty black maws gaping , holds its lair inside
1	all that i promised once i have performed at last
1	and we stood by , amazed that such a marvel came to light
1	so athena fired the fool 's heart inside him
1	he is destined to survive
1	have you the daring to wing an arrow at menelaus ?
1	so prince achilles hailed and led them in , sat them down on settles with purple carpets and quickly told patroclus standing by , come , a bigger winebowl , son of menoetius , set it here
1	far out in the offing , fronting the foaming coastline , looms a rock
1	that 's when the fury gripped the son of atreus
1	there they spent the night and took the gift of sleep
1	not that they would hide him out of friendship , even if someone saw him — all of them hated him like death , black death
1	why , even if you were badly wounded in battle , winged by a shaft or gored by a blade close-up , the weapon would never hit you behind , in neck or back — it would pierce your chest or guts as you press forward , lusting for all the champions ' lovely give-and-take
1	now , few out of many truths i will reveal to you , so you can cross the welcoming seas more safely , moor secure in a latian harbor
1	the region next to them is held by those sad ghosts , innocents all , who brought on death by their own hands ; despising the light , they threw their lives away
1	many a mother in tuscan cities yearned for her as a daughter
1	for the winner a large tripod made to stride a fire and worth a dozen oxen , so the soldiers reckoned
1	i swear by the stars , by the powers on high , whatever faith one swears by here in the depths of earth , i left your shores , my queen , against my will
1	but king agamemnon interceded quickly , diomedes , soldier after my own heart , pick your comrade now , whomever you want , the best of the volunteers — how many long to go !
1	numanus , out of the front lines he swaggered , chest puffed up with his newfound royal rank and he let loose an indiscriminate string of ugly insults , flaunting his own power to high heaven : what , have you no shame ?
1	so , certain that all contenders had withdrawn , the trophy his alone , he strode up to aeneas now and never pausing , full of swagger , grasps the bull ’ s horn with his left hand and boasts : son of venus , since no one dares to face me in the ring , how long do i have to stand here ?
1	then in ride the boys , trim in their ranks before their parents ’ eyes , mounted on bridled steeds and glittering in the light and as they pass , the men of troy and sicily murmur a hum of admiration
1	his forebear is pilumnus , his mother a goddess , venilia !
1	do not harbor it deep inside you
1	until you argives seize the well-built towers of troy or you yourselves are crushed against your ships
1	so leto gathered the reflex bow and arrows scattered left and right in the swirling dust , and bearing her daughter 's archery in her arms withdrew from the field of battle trailing artemis
1	his pleas were moving the heart in menelaus , just at the point of handing him to an aide to take him back to the fast achaean ships
1	why , it seems like only yesterday or the day before when our vast armada gathered , moored at aulis , freighted with slaughter bound for priam 's troy
1	and the white-armed goddess hera obeyed at once — clearing ida 's peaks she soared for sheer olympus
1	those bodies felled by the sword and strewn about the field : return them , let them lie with mounds of earth for cover
1	no time for speeches now , it 's time to fight
1	where would destiny take us ?
1	come , try me , immortals , so all of you can learn
1	yes , we will keep clear of the war as you command
1	now come , we haul a black ship down to the bright sea , gather a decent number of oarsmen along her locks and put aboard a sacrifice , and chryseis herself , in all her beauty
1	we all recall that moment — who could forget it ?
1	and achaea 's kings all shouted their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking diomedes ' challenge
1	one would glance at a comrade , groaning , what next — battle again , more pain and grisly fighting ?
1	where are you flying now— what other walls , what other ramparts have you got ?
1	but there he sits , off and away — with never a care or qualm for us — claiming that he among the deathless gods on high is first in strength and power , none in the world his rival
1	don ’ t join battle , sword to sword
1	if achilles fights the trojans — unopposed by us — not for a moment will they hold his breakneck force
1	you unforgivable , you
1	but raising his shield , swerving to brave his foe , he strained to save himself with his naked sword—when the wheel and whirling axle knocked him headlong , ground him into the dust
1	routed so , we have seen our fill of death
1	father , what motive changed your mind ?
1	but now a crisis has overwhelmed our armies
1	the shaft of a good-for-nothing coward 's got no point but mine 's got heft and edge
1	look at the armies massing , cities bolting their gates , honing swords against me to cut my loved ones down
1	why this mad desire , poor souls , for the light of life ?
1	but only if phoenix wishes
1	left behind there , down by the beaked ships his great avenger waited , a greater man by far — that man was i , and i smashed your strength !
1	right here , not far to seek
1	you have done me so many kindnesses , and you could count them all
1	so hector shouted out to deiphobus bearing his white shield — with a ringing shout he called for a heavy lance — but the man was nowhere near him , vanished — yes and hector knew the truth in his heart and the fighter cried aloud , my time has come !
1	it 's hard for me , strong as i am , single-handed to breach the wall and cut a path to the ships — come , shoulder-to-shoulder !
1	now repay me for all the loving care andromache , generous eetion 's daughter , showered on you aplenty
1	he still refuses , holds to his resolve , clings to the spot
1	nor did i bring one ray of hope to my patroclus , nor to the rest of all my steadfast comrades , countless ranks struck down by mighty hector — no , no , here i sit by the ships
1	now ilioneus ’ sturdy ship , now brave achates ’ , now the galley that carried abas , another , aged aletes , yes , the storm routs them all , down to the last craft the joints split , beams spring and the lethal flood pours in
1	at first the trojans could ram the argives back and they abandoned the corpse , their fiery-eyed battalions fled away in panic
1	so many widows left
1	the head wrenched from the shoulders
1	next aeneas , as rugged cisseus , giant gyas clubbed their way through his ranks : he flung both down to death
1	and catching sight of helen moving along the ramparts , they murmured one to another , gentle , winged words : who on earth could blame them ?
1	nestor the noble charioteer embraced his offer : generous marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon !
1	enough of endless tears , the pain that breaks the spirit
1	lurking there under cover , he hit it in the heart and the fine kill went sprawling down the rocks
1	condemned to beg for his own death and brutal doom
1	and now pisander rushed menelaus famed in arms but a grim fate was rushing him to the stroke of death — to be crushed in this hell of war by you , menelaus
1	now for a dozen days they made their truce and , peace intervening , trojans and latins mingled safely , ranging the woods and mountain ridges side by side
1	so strong , this dares , first to cock his head for combat , flaunting his broad shoulders , sparring , lefts and rights , beating the air with blows
1	— turning over victory to poseidon , total victory , giving him all the glory here without a fight
1	now the renowned spearman ajax rushed against him , slashing him down the flank , knocking him backward — trojans and argives swarming over him , out for blood
1	some charge at the gates and cut the sentries down and others whirl their steel , blot out the sky with spears
1	at that , both of them march in step along the shadowed paths , consuming the space between , and approach the doors
1	hercules , you the unvanquished one !
1	you will never persuade me
1	you are far stronger than i still , you must not make my labor come to nothing
1	now the son of atreus stripped him , robbed his corpse and strode back to his waiting argive armies , hoisting the gleaming gear
1	now after meriones yoked his sleek horses fifth , they boarded their cars and dropped lots in a helmet
1	until some fatal power decides between us both , handing victory down to our side — or the other
1	he even sees himself swept up in the melee , clashing with greek captains , sees the troops of the dawn and swarthy memnon ’ s arms
1	better to flee from death than feel its grip
1	and then , at that , an immense cry rose up and hit the golden stars
1	but now aeneas , still at sea , scanning the offing , spots an enormous wood and running through it , the tiber in all its glory , rapids , whirlpools golden with sand and bursting out to sea
1	then his mother who bore him — oh so doomed , she and i could glut ourselves with grief
1	but neleus would not let me arm for action — he would hidden away my horses , thought his boy still green at the work of war
1	the weapon shaking , planted fast in the ground , his whole arm 's power poured in a wasted shot , aeneas flared in anger , shouting out , meriones — great dancer as you are , my spear would have stopped your dancing days for good if only i had hit you !
1	not one of you dare forget those threats you hurled from the fast trim ships against the trojans all the while i raged , and i was the one you blamed , down to the last fighter : 'brutal son of peleus — your mother nursed you on gall !
1	now the besiegers , soon as they heard the uproar burst from the cattle as they debated , huddled in council , mounted at once behind their racing teams , rode hard to the rescue , arrived at once , and lining up for assault both armies battled it out along the river banks — they raked each other with hurtling bronze-tipped spears
1	no , no , let the earth come piling over my dead body before i hear your cries , i hear you dragged away !
1	there sits great aeneas
1	no brother deserts a brother here !
1	i can see the clouds parting , the stars riding the arching skies
1	then men from fields where jove of anxur reigns and goddess feronia takes joy in her fine green grove , and troops from satura ’ s black marsh where the frigid ufens weaves his way through a valley ’ s bottom land and plunges down to sea
1	iarbas—son of an african nymph whom jove had raped— raised the god a hundred splendid temples across the king ’ s wide realm , a hundred altars too , consecrating the sacred fires that never died , eternal sentinels of the gods
1	so lead us on to the left flank — we will soon see if we give our enemy glory or win it for ourselves
1	both champions , belted tight , stepped into the ring and grappling each other hard with big burly arms , locked like rafters a master builder bolts together , slanting into a pitched roof to fight the ripping winds
1	oh if only — father zeus , athena , apollo — i were young again !
1	how he bragged and hector , grasping his scepter , swore a binding oath : now zeus my witness , thundering lord of hera — no other trojan fighter will ride behind that team , none but you , i swear — they will be your glory all your life to come !
1	credit will go to you for whatever he proposes
1	then , if the ninth dawn brings a brilliant day to the race of men and her rays lay bare the earth , i shall hold games for all our trojans
1	the harpy celaeno alone foretold a monstrous sign , chanting out the unspeakable—withering wrath to come and the ghastly pangs of famine
1	as gale-winds swirl and shatter under the shrilling gusts on days when drifts of dust lie piled thick on the roads and winds whip up the dirt in a dense whirling cloud — so the battle broke , storming chaos , troops inflamed , slashing each other with bronze , carnage mounting , manslaughtering combat bristling with rangy spears , the honed lances brandished in hand and ripping flesh and the eyes dazzled now , blind with the glare of bronze , glittering helmets flashing , breastplates freshly burnished , shields fiery in sunlight , fighters plowing on in a mass
1	i will hold our attack as long as you require
1	meleager 's cleopatra — she was the one he lay beside those days , brooding over his heartbreaking anger
1	give me your horses — so i can reach olympus , the gods ' steep stronghold
1	no love between us
1	but father zeus on the heights forced ajax to retreat
1	at that hour the morning star comes rising up to herald a new day on earth , and riding in its wake the dawn flings out her golden robe across the sea , the funeral fires sank low , the flames died down
1	zeus who rules the world forbids me to battle trojans all day long
1	now the great array of gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long , but the peaceful grip of sleep could not hold zeus , turning it over in his mind
1	but now , chaos—the city begins to reel with cries of grief , louder , stronger , even though father ’ s palace stood well back , screened off by trees , but still the clash of arms rings clearer , horror on the attack
1	these are the solemn honors owed the dead
1	now as the two came closing on each other patroclus suddenly picked off thrasymelus the famous driver , the aide who flanked sarpedon — he speared him down the guts and loosed his limbs
1	trust me , my friend , you will never force the trojans back from this corpse with a few stinging taunts — earth will bury many a man before that
1	he swore he would give me the great achilles ' stallions , purebred racers , his burnished bronze chariot too !
1	and they , they shook from head to foot , terrified , none with the nerve to face him then
1	but the only thing you will win at my hands here , i promise you , is slaughter and black doom
1	not that sarpedon yielded all the way , never , his heart still raced with hopes of winning glory , whirling , shouting back to his splendid lycians , lycians — why do you slack your fighting-fury now ?
1	i have avenged my husband , punished my blood-brother , our mortal foe
1	put zeus to sleep for me !
1	from the peak of aeneas ’ helmet flames are leaping forth and a deadly blaze comes pouring from its crest
1	so they will say , someday , and my fame will never die
1	hector killed him now with whetted bronze , cleaving his skull above the ear as he stood by ajax
1	beware the toils of war
1	as ravening fire rips through big stands of timber high on a mountain ridge and the blaze flares miles away , so from the marching troops the blaze of bronze armor , splendid and superhuman , flared across the earth , flashing into the air to hit the skies
1	now we will fight — and death to the one marked out for doom and death !
1	look at you , how you sleep in the midst of men who would kill you — and just because achilles spared your life
1	soldiers , he shouts from a barrow some way off , what drives you to try these unfamiliar paths ?
1	watchfires flickering far apart
1	by heaven , ereuthalion was the biggest , strongest man i ever killed , the huge lumbering sprawl of him stretching far and wide !
1	now as i lay asleep they seemed to stand before me , clear before my eyes , so vivid , washed in the light of the full moon flooding in through deepset windows
1	and sibyl , for you too , a magnificent sacred shrine awaits you in our kingdom
1	last , handsomest captain of them all , comes iulus riding a mount from sidon , radiant dido ’ s gift , a memento of the queen , a pledge of her affection
1	here they ’ re dredging a harbor , there they lay foundations deep for a theater , quarrying out of rock great columns to form a fitting scene for stages still to come
1	he lashed the team and on they flew to the ships , holding nothing back — that 's where their spirits drove them on to go
1	the rumor spread at once through trojan ranks that the day had come to build their destined city
1	then , heaping a mass of plunder seized in the latin rout , aeneas orders it borne home in a long cortege , adding the steeds and arms he stripped from foes
1	at that the white-armed goddess hera smiled and smiling , took the cup from her child 's hands
1	but the old and noble priam answered firmly , i will go
1	well let him go , i say !
1	then odysseus weighed out ten full bars of gold and led the princes back , laden with other gifts , and they set them down amid the meeting grounds
1	we give you glory — seize it in your hands !
1	for i am bound to you by my own strength , by oracles of the gods and by our fathers— blood-kin—and your own fame that echoes through the world
1	you , the only balm of my old age !
1	and thrusting it into hera 's outstretched hands she breathed her name in a throbbing , rising voice : here now , take this band , put it between your breasts — ravishing openwork , and the world lies in its weaving !
1	fling your sheets to the winds , sail free !
1	lie there , take their measure
1	a day will come when the trojan lords and captains send an immense dust storm swirling down the plain — with your own eyes you will see them break for troy , leaving your ships and shelters free and clear !
1	four warlords led their ranks , ten-ship flotillas each , and filling the decks came bands of epean fighters , two companies under thalpius and amphimachus , sons of the line of actor , one of eurytus , one of cteatus
1	men whose mattocks till the massic earth for wine , auruncans their fathers sent from the rising hills and sidicine flats close by , and men just come from cales , men who make their homes along the volturnus ’ shoals and beside them rough saticulans , squads of oscans
1	let all the etruscans join them at once as allies !
1	revere the gods , achilles !
1	all i ask is time , blank time : some rest from frenzy , breathing room till my fate can teach my beaten spirit how to grieve
1	nor do i exempt the italians
1	and so with men : as one generation comes to life , another dies away
1	who was moved by cassandra ’ s visions then ?
1	you wo not return , i know , your mission unfulfilled , whatever your eager heart desires to do
1	nothing has changed my mind
1	that man without a shred of decency in his heart
1	ah what joy to advance the banners , hear the trumpets blare !
1	and then , at first light , let the herald idaeus go to the beaked ships and tell the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , the offer of paris who caused our long hard campaign
1	what should he do ?
1	and with that telamonian ajax strode off with his brother teucer , his own father 's son , and pandion cradling teucer 's long curved bow
1	how can all achaeans be masters here in troy ?
1	her father and noble mother loved her dearly , the pride of their halls excelling all her age in beauty , works of the loom and good clear sense
1	pallas marches out to the center of the field and the blood runs cold in each arcadian heart
1	there , through its nine mouths as the mountain caves roar back , the river bursts out into full flood , a thundering surf that overpowers the fields
1	i am hardly the man to order men , against their will , to haul the oar-swept vessels out to sea
1	no use to you then , the fine lyre and these , these gifts of aphrodite , your long flowing locks and your striking looks , not when you roll and couple with the dust
1	at last the gods have called me down to death
1	the gallant wife in tears , longing for him , her wedded husband , the best of the achaeans — diomedes breaker of horses
1	urging so but his men already burned to drive the trojans off
1	nestor , the first to hear their thunder , shouted , friends — lords of the argives , all our captains , right or wrong , what can i say ?
1	leaving the council now with thousands in his wake , amid his immense cortege , aeneas gains the tomb and here he pours libations , each in proper order
1	how blind men ’ s minds to their fate and what the future holds , how blind to limits when fortune lifts men high
1	but the noble son of pelegon answered firmly , high-hearted son of peleus , why ask about my birth ?
1	hidden deep in a shady tree there grows a golden bough , its leaves and its hardy , sinewy stem all gold , held sacred to juno of the dead , proserpina
1	and here the trojan women are moving toward the temple of pallas , their deadly foe , their hair unbound as they bear the robe , their offering , suppliants grieving , palms beating their breasts but pallas turns away , staring at the ground
1	i swear by the gods , dear anna , by your sweet life , i arm myself with magic arts against my will
1	but nothing , no specter on earth has touched your heart with fear , not even typhoeus himself , towering up with weapons
1	no , you must turn back — soon as you bring the light of victory to the ships
1	do not steal on me in silence — what do you want ?
1	here in this grove a strange sight met his eyes and calmed his fears for the first time
1	we will never take the broad streets of troy
1	now deep in the heart of carthage stood a grove , lavish with shade , where the tyrians , making landfall , still shaken by wind and breakers , first unearthed that sign : queen juno had led their way to the fiery stallion ’ s head that signaled power in war and ease in life for ages
1	do not let him try to frighten me with his mighty hands — what does he take me for , some coward out-and-out ?
1	down to the god of death he goes , i tell you , down to the mighty gates but thrilled at heart — look at the escort i have sent him for the journey !
1	but the grim ferryman ushers aboard now these , now those , others he thrusts away , back from the water ’ s edge
1	hector leaping back in his chariot , swerving to fly , shouted out fresh orders — retreat , trojans , now !
1	some scatter back to their ships , making a run for shore and safety
1	once when achilles harried the breathless trojans , pounding their ranks against their walls , slaughtering thousands , rivers crammed with corpses groaned and the xanthus could find no channel rolling down to sea , and then as aeneas went up against the mighty achilles— hardly a match for the man ’ s gods , the man ’ s power— then i saved him , wrapped him into a fold of clouds , though i longed to crush their ramparts roots and all , the walls i built with my own hands—those lying trojans !
1	no river so wild , so frothing in spate , bursting its banks to overpower the dikes , anything in its way , its cresting tides stampeding in fury down on the fields to sweep the flocks and stalls across the open plain
1	no , there 's no great citadel standing near with towers where we could defend ourselves and troops could turn the tide
1	with you i will forsake the light of this life i hate—never in shackles live to see aeneas as my son !
1	he aimed and hurled and his spear 's long shadow flew — a clean hit , no miss , trained at the head of hector , his helmet ridge
1	nor will i permit a single immortal god to save the argive forces , not till achilles ' prayer has been fulfilled
1	at his command they raised this horse , this effigy , all to atone for the violated image of pallas , her wounded pride , her power—and expiate the outrage they had done
1	with that , standing over against the bull ’ s head steadied there , the battle ’ s prize , he drew the iron gauntlet back and rearing up for the blow , swings it square between both horns , crushing the skull and dashing out the brains , and dying , quivering , down on the ground the great beast sprawls
1	planting his body right in front , legs spread wide , his weight in the blow to give it total impact , hector hurled at the gates , full center , smashing the hinges left and right and the boulder tore through , dropped with a crash and both gates groaned and thundered — the doorbars could not hold , the planking shattered up in a flying storm of splinters under the rock 's force and hector burst through in glory , his face dark as the sudden rushing night but he blazed on in bronze and terrible fire broke from the gear that wrapped his body , two spears in his fists
1	now cupid is on the move , under her orders , bringing the tyrians royal gifts , his spirits high as achates leads him on
1	never a chance that i could win you over
1	come , let 's give him a prize , it 's only right — but second prize , of course — tydeus ' son must carry off the first
1	an olympian messenger came to me from zeus — i must go to achaea 's ships and ransom our dear son , bearing gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
1	like her to the life , immortal love invited , quickly — paris is calling for you , come back home !
1	zeus , father zeus , they say you excel all others
1	but granted that no one tempted you in the past , not in your great grief , no libyan suitor , and none before in tyre , you scorned iarbas and other lords of africa , sons bred by this fertile earth in all their triumph : why resist it now , this love that stirs your heart ?
1	but time and again we two have sworn our oaths in the eyes of all the gods — i and pallas athena — never to drive the fatal day away from the trojans , not even when all troy burns in the ramping flames when the warring sons of achaea burn her down !
1	let lavinia be his bride
1	a gift he will value highly
1	i am not bent on plunder stripped from a girl , no trophy over her corpse
1	or i who equipped the man with weapons , fanned the flames of war with lust ?
1	tarchon , on the watch for a welcome stretch of beach where the shoals don ’ t churn , no breakers booming low but a smooth unbroken groundswell glides toward the sand , abruptly swerves his prow around and spurs his shipmates : now , my chosen hands , you bend to your sturdy oars !
1	but hector is mortal
1	now— neither mighty juno nor saturn ’ s son , the father , gazes down on this with just , impartial eyes
1	i wish you would lingered deep with the deathless sea-nymphs , lived at ease , and peleus carried home a mortal bride
1	on the trojans came , straight for the rock-tight wall , raising rawhide shields and yelling their lungs out , grouped under captain asius , iamenus and orestes and asius ' own son adamas , thoon and oenomaus
1	men sprawling , sunk in their wine and sleep
1	no sons of atreus here , no spinner of tales , ulysses
1	so what if i am not a world-class man of war ?
1	my son , his tears brimming , father anchises started in , don ’ t press to know your people ’ s awesome grief
1	the kingdom of the dead so as he speaks in tears aeneas gives the ships free rein and at last they glide onto euboean cumae ’ s beaches
1	why keep flinging your wretched people into naked peril ?
1	from that point the men sent tydeus on ahead , bearing their message
1	landing , drawing lots for tomorrow ’ s stint at the oars , we stretch out in the lap of welcome land at water ’ s edge and scattered along the dry beach refresh ourselves as sleep comes streaming through our weary bodies
1	and even now the cavalry had come riding forth through the open gates , aeneas out in the lead , flanked by trusty achates , then other trojan captains , with pallas in command of the column ’ s center , pallas brilliant in battle cape and glittering inlaid armor
1	juno nodded assent to this , her spirit reversed to joy
1	— sleep cried , thrilled by the offer — swear to me by the incorruptible tides of styx , one hand grasping the earth that feeds mankind , the other the bright sea , that all may be our witness , all gods under earth that gather round king cronus !
1	all the while messapus is ordered to cordon off the gates with a sentry-line and gird the walls with fire
1	they bend hard to the oars and pull for all they ’ re worth , and the bronze hull shivers under their massive strokes and the deep sweeps by beneath them— gasping for breath , their chests wracked , mouths parched , sweat rivering down their backs , but blind chance brings that crew the prize they yearn for
1	they scoured it off , threw scourings in the surf and sacrificed to apollo full-grown bulls and goats along the beaten shore of the fallow barren sea and savory smoke went swirling up the skies
1	odysseus caught the signal , filled his cup and lifted it toward achilles , opening with this toast : your health , achilles !
1	nothing i said was meant in earnest , trust me , i mean you all the good will in the world
1	three brothers we are , all sprung from cronus , all of us brought to birth by rhea — zeus and i , hades the third , lord of the dead beneath the earth
1	on with it now — show us your strength , full force
1	and one lone footpath led toward the vineyard and down it the pickers ran whenever they went to strip the grapes at vintage — girls and boys , their hearts leaping in innocence , bearing away the sweet ripe fruit in wicker baskets
1	the trojans shuddered to see the serpent glistening , wriggling at their feet , a sign from storming zeus
1	hearing achilles , forth he came from his shelter , striding up like the deathless god of war but from that moment on his doom was sealed
1	even niobe with her lustrous hair remembered food , though she saw a dozen children killed in her own halls , six daughters and six sons in the pride and prime of youth
1	aeneas presents a pair of brazen cauldrons for third prize and two cups of hammered silver , ridged in sharp relief
1	but bent on glory hector answered the giant ajax taunt for taunt : enough of your blustering threats , you clumsy ox — what loose talk , what rant !
1	let the whole myrmidon army follow my command — i might bring some light of victory to our argives !
1	what if i face him out before the walls ?
1	now the moment calls
1	as for the gifts , here i am to produce them all , all that good odysseus promised you in full , the other day , when he approached your tents
1	it 's a welcome thing to make love with a woman
1	men as many as breakers rolling in from the libyan sea when savage orion sets low in the winter waves or dense as the ears of corn baked by an early sun on hermus ’ plain or lycia ’ s burnished fields
1	the father 's will was set on giving glory over to hector son of priam that he might hurl his torch at the beaked ships — the force of fire , quenchless , ravening fire , yes , and bring to its bitter end the disastrous prayer of thetis
1	so you can see the breed of tros 's team , their flair for their own terrain as they gallop back and forth , one moment in flight , the next in hot pursuit — i took them both from aeneas , driving terrors
1	i saw them heading first for the turn , by god , but i ca not find them now — anywhere — hard as i look , left and right , scanning the whole trojan plain
1	so now , menelaus o my king , you turned your shining eyes , scanning the crowds of comrades front and rear , trying to see if nestor 's son was still alive
1	and once they would heaped the mound they turned back home to troy , and gathering once again they shared a splendid funeral feast in hector 's honor , held in the house of priam , king by will of zeus
1	cassandra ’ s raving spurred him on !
1	and then lord nestor rose and spoke among the men : no more — or enormous sorrow comes to all achaea !
1	jove said no more
1	each captain killed his man
1	bear up now , despite your heartsick grief
1	patroclus stretched him out , knelt with a knife and cut the sharp , stabbing arrow out of eurypylus ' thigh and washed the wound clean of the dark running blood with clear warm water
1	breathing room in war is all too brief
1	and then by juno ’ s doors beneath the vaulted dome , flanked by an honor guard beside her lofty seat , the queen assumed her throne
1	yes , they fail to fulfill their promise sworn that day they sailed here from the stallion-land of argos : that not until you had razed the rugged walls of troy would they sail home again
1	they leave me to wander up and down , abandoned , lost at the house of death with the all-embracing gates
1	the first battalion was led by menesthius bright in bronze , son of spercheus river swelled by the rains of zeus and born by the lovely polydora , peleus ' daughter , when a girl and the god of a tireless river bedded down
1	the chief was helpless to rip it off his shoulders — enemy weapons jolted him back with so much force his legs buckled , the old driving power lost , no dash left to dive for a spear or dodge one
1	achilles strode off to his trim ships and shelters , back to his friend patroclus and their comrades
1	great as he is , what overweening arrogance !
1	may all the gods who help the trojans fall as hard when they battle argives armed for war — all as courageous , all as steadfast as aphrodite when she sped to ares ' side and faced my fury !
1	dardan fighters hand-to-hand — now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
1	dressed his body in deathless , ambrosial robes then sent him on his way with the wind-swift escorts , twin brothers sleep and death , who with all good speed set him down in lycia 's broad green land
1	hector seized the corpse 's head , would not let go — patroclus clung to a foot and other fighters clashed , trojans , argives , all in a grueling , maiming onset
1	just my spirit burning to muster troops for battle , rush with comrades up to the city ’ s heights , fury and rage driving me breakneck on as it races through my mind what a noble thing it is to die in arms !
1	you and your warring kings , your false alarms , you mockery of a prophet !
1	but now as i pitch at a third stalk , doubling my effort , knees bracing against the sand , struggling to pry it loose— shall i tell you or hold my tongue ? —i hear it , clearly , a wrenching groan rising up from the deep mound , a cry heaving into the air : why , aeneas , why mangle this wretched flesh ?
1	not forgetting to send his shipmates on the beaches twenty bulls and a hundred huge , bristling razorbacks and a hundred fatted lambs together with their mothers : gifts to make this day a day of joy
1	now i alone have the right to enter combat
1	hold dear the son we share , we love together
1	come say your parting salutes and leave my body so
1	this is the hunger he meant , this the last trial , the last limit set to our pains of exile
1	better that way by far than to have you strutting here , an outrage — a mockery in the eyes of all our enemies
1	heal our feuds at once !
1	think , even if he escapes the wrenching horrors of war against the argives , pain and labor will plague him all his days to come
1	there are the gates , facing us with their arch
1	for the good of all he urged them : agamemnon !
1	what a grief it will be to you through all the years to come
1	still round alcathous fighters kept on lunging in
1	and then and there , menelaus , the death-stroke would have blazed before your eyes — dead at the hands of hector , a far stronger man — if argive kings had not leapt up and caught you
1	you order me to explain apollo 's anger , the distant deadly archer ?
1	the gods are hard to handle — when they come blazing forth in their true power
1	like a giant breaker rearing up on the rangy seas , crashing over a ship 's sides , driven in by the winds and the blast builds the comber 's crushing impact — a hoarse roar !
1	old homes deserted , baring their necks , they loose their hair to the winds ; some fill the air with their high-pitched , trilling wails , decked in fawnskins , brandishing lances wound with vines
1	and after the coals sank in and the fires died down , they washed his embers , thirsty remains , with wine
1	this iarbas , driven wild , set ablaze by the bitter rumor , approached an altar , they say , as the gods hovered round , and lifting a suppliant ’ s hands , he poured out prayers to jove : almighty jove !
1	here the firegod dove from heaven ’ s heights
1	oenotrians settled it ; now we hear their descendants call their kingdom italy , after their leader , italus
1	seeing them die against the hollow ships , repaid for their offenses ?
1	climbing out of the breakers , there poseidon sat and pitied the argives beaten down by trojan troops and his churning outrage rose against the father
1	and as for our own healers , podalirius and machaon , one is back in the shelters , wounded , i think — machaon needs a good strong healer himself , he 's racked with pain
1	a crack of the lash — the team plunged to a run and on the stallions flew , holding nothing back as they winged between the earth and starry skies and gaining the slopes of ida with all her springs , the mother of wild beasts , they reached gargaron peak where the grove of zeus and zeus 's smoking altar stand
1	go through the ranks and rally all the troops
1	he had been mighty hector ’ s friend , by hector ’ s side in the rush of battle , shining with spear and trumpet both
1	but you , what following winds , what fates have sailed you here ?
1	first by far agamemnon lord of men sprang up and following him tydides , powerful diomedes , next the great and little ajax armed in fury , idomeneus after them and idomeneus ' good aide , meriones , a match for the butcher god of war , eurypylus after them , euaemon 's gallant son , thoas son of andraemon , odysseus out for exploit : all were roused to go up against prince hector
1	they refresh the banquet , bringing on the second course , a welcome savor , weighing the altars down with groaning platters
1	not far from there he had forged rome as well and the sabine women brutally dragged from the crowded bowl when the circus games were played and abruptly war broke out afresh , the sons of romulus battling old king tatius ’ hardened troops from cures
1	book twenty-four : achilles and priam
1	they are hard for mortal men to curb and drive , for all but achilles — his mother is immortal
1	those mares in front are the same that led before — they are eumelus ' mares , look , and there 's eumelus now , astride his chariot , gripping the reins himself !
1	you ’ d force the innocent harpies from their fathers ’ kingdom ?
1	with a trojan army marching at our side , think how the glory of carthage will tower to the clouds !
1	if i was a young man then , now old age dogs my steps
1	a stunned silence seized them all , struck dumb — achilles ' ringing denials overwhelmed them so
1	not even a hawk-eyed scout could still make out sarpedon , the man 's magnificent body covered over head to toe , buried under a mass of weapons , blood and dust
1	troy , home of the gods !
1	since here , they say , are the gates of death ’ s king and the dark marsh where the acheron comes flooding up , please , allow me to go and see my beloved father , meet him face-to-face
1	now , if in the years to come you will accord with me , my wide-eyed queen , throned with me in the gods ' decisive sessions , then poseidon , bent as he is to go his own way , must change at once and wrench his will to ours , to yours and mine united
1	the son of a great man , the mother who gave me life a deathless goddess
1	but it 's man-killing hector calling his trojans on , his war cries crashing round me , savage cries of his trojans sweeping the whole plain , victors bringing the argive armies to their knees
1	phoenician dido is in command , she sailed from tyre , in flight from her own brother
1	like a blast of the thracian northwind howling over the deep aegean , whipping the waves toward shore , wherever the winds burst down the clouds take flight through the sky , so turnus , wherever he hacks his path , the lines buckle in and the ranks turn tail and run as his own drive sweeps him on , his rushing chariot charging the gusts that toss his crest
1	the mast shuddered , the dove fluttered in fright and the whole arena round rang out with cheers
1	do i take flight alone , consorting with crews of trojan oarsmen in their triumph ?
1	so calchas read the omens
1	how she fumed , zeus 's child who showers arrows , she loosed a bristling wild boar , his tusks gleaming , crashing his savage , monstrous way through oeneus ' orchard , ripping up whole trunks from the earth to pitch them headlong , rows of them , roots and all , appleblossoms and all !
1	a deathtrap , no way out for the monster now !
1	no more escape for you — athena will kill you with my spear in just a moment
1	my other feats of arms will win me glory
1	soon as said they take their mark , ready , set— a sudden signal— go ! — and they break from the start , pouring over the course like a stormcloud streaking on , all eyes fixed on the goal , with nisus far in the lead , shooting out of the tight pack and faster than wind or the winged lightning—second , second at quite a gap , comes salius—next , and a good long way behind , euryalus coming third , and after euryalus , helymus , then diores flying hot on his heels and closer , closing , watch , breathing over his shoulder and if there had been more track to cover he would have caught and passed him or run him a dead heat
1	so please go home and tend to your own tasks , the distaff and the loom , and keep the women working hard as well
1	it 's not the hour to meet your doom , not yet
1	the stygian tide-pools trembled at your arrival , death ’ s watchdog cringed , sprawling over the heaps of half-devoured bones in his gory cave
1	mezentius cries , grinning through his rage : as for my own death , the father of gods and king of men will see to that
1	so aeneas , overpowered by missiles left and right , braves out the cloudburst of war till its thunder dies away and then he taunts lausus , threatens lausus : why hurry your death ?
1	the earth-shaker himself , trident locked in his grip , led the way , rocking loose , sweeping up in his breakers all the bastion 's strong supports of logs and stones the achaeans prized in place with grueling labor
1	so he said and the armies called assent to what he urged
1	strong as a boar he urged his frontline troops as meriones brought the rear battalions up
1	now fighter go against fighter , out for bloodshed !
1	here i thought i would punish paris for all his outrage — now my sword is shattered , right in my hands , look , my spear flew from my grip for nothing — i never hit him !
1	the bow slipped from his grip
1	the men gird up for the game , the coming feast , they skin the hide from the ribs , lay bare the meat
1	the lord of the war cry menelaus came uncalled , he knew at heart what weighed his brother down
1	when the trojans saw idomeneus fierce as fire , him and his aide-in-arms in handsome blazoned gear , they all cried out and charged them through the press and a sudden , pitched battle broke at the ships ' sterns
1	but as he turned back , his host spun out the tightest trap of all : picking the best men from lycia far and wide he set an ambush — that never came home again !
1	even the finest speaker finds intrusions hard
1	as soon as our ships had reached the high seas , no land in sight , no longer—water at all points , at all points the sky— looming over our heads a pitch-dark thunderhead brings on night and storm , ruffling the swells black
1	how do we know they are not about to attack us in the night ?
1	a terrible thing
1	you great walls of the dardans long renowned in war !
1	she no longer thinks to keep the affair a secret , no , she calls it a marriage , using the word to cloak her sense of guilt
1	urging so , with his own hands he carries vesta forth from her inner shrine , her image clad in ribbons , filled with her power , her everlasting fire
1	he rose up quickly and over his chest he pulled a battle-shirt , under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals , round him slung the glossy hide of a big tawny lion , swinging down to his heels , and grasped a spear
1	yoking the fields of others , hauling off the plunder ?
1	and dolon son of the herald kept on blurting , everything — anything — whatever will satisfy you !
1	their father lived in the fortress town of phera , a man of wealth and worth , born of alpheus river running wide through pylian hills , the stream that sired ortilochus to rule their many men
1	he left his team and burnished bronze car with an aide , eurymedon , ptolemaeus piraides ' son reining off to the side his snorting pair of stallions
1	like sheepdogs keeping watch on flocks in folds , a nervous , bristling watch when the dogs get wind of a wild beast rampaging down through mountain timber , crashing toward the pens , and the cries break as he charges , a din of men and dogs , and their sleep is broken , gone — and so the welcome sleep was routed from their eyes , guardsmen keeping the long hard watch that night
1	we fling open the gates and stream out , elated to see the greeks ’ abandoned camp , the deserted beachhead
1	there poseidon sat at ease with his deathless friends who spread unbroken shrouds of mist around their shoulders , while far on the other side the gods of troy sat down on the brows of sunlight hill , flanking you , apollo , god of the wild cry , and ares scourge of cities
1	he takes delight in the cape that bears his name
1	then , at last , the port of drepanum takes me in , a shore that brought no joy
1	we would come to the strong and storied house of peleus , out for recruits across achaea 's good green land
1	but now i will go for the others , anyone i can catch
1	the trojans echo back with a roar of joy , their spirits sky-high
1	that 's all i would ask
1	not to interrupt him , the only courteous thing
1	here in the presence of our united armed contingents let talthybius quickly prepare a wild boar for me — we must sacrifice to the sun and father zeus
1	nor did lerna ’ s hydra , heads swarming around you , strip you of your wits
1	not in the horror of battle , and that is why the whole city of troy mourns you now , my hector — you have brought your parents accursed tears and grief but to me most of all you have left the horror , the heartbreak !
1	there she found him , sweating , wheeling round his bellows , pressing the work on twenty three-legged cauldrons , an array to ring the walls inside his mansion
1	your wits are gone — where 's your respect for others ?
1	what could wound the queen of the gods with all her power ?
1	he ’ d barely ended when all at once the mist around them parted , melting into the open air , and there aeneas stood , clear in the light of day , his head , his shoulders , the man was like a god
1	like a tawny lion when hounds and country field hands drive him out of their steadings filled with cattle — they will never let him tear the rich fat from the oxen , all night long they stand guard but the lion craves meat , he lunges in and in but his charges gain him nothing , thick-and-fast from their hardy arms the javelins rain down in his face , and waves of blazing torches — these the big cat fears , balking for all his rage , and at dawn he slinks away , his spirits dashed
1	soiling his gray hair with dust , flinging both hands to the skies , he clings to his son ’ s body , crying : was i so seized by the lust for life , my son , i let you take my place before the enemy ’ s sword ?
1	meriones caught him quickly , running him down hard and speared him low in the right buttock — the point pounding under the pelvis , jabbed and pierced the bladder — he dropped to his knees , screaming , death swirling round him
1	but lord god apollo , gazing down now from the heights of pergamus , rose in outrage , crying down at the trojans , up and at them , you stallion-breaking trojans !
1	with that he tossed the bloody gear in the chariot , climbed aboard with his hands and feet dripping gore like a lion that rends and bolts a bull
1	and then through camp we took our evening meal by rank and file , and caught what sleep we could , each in his gear along the river rapids
1	and now he lies in the halls , broken with grisly age , but now my griefs are worse
1	but facing them the achaean ranks cried back , not forgetting their courage , braced hard for assault as the trojans ' bravest charged and roars from both armies struck the high clear skies , the lightning world of zeus
1	he rose up tall and challenged all the achaeans : now men come forward , fight to win this prize !
1	but pirous — aetolian thoas speared him as he swerved and sprang away , the lancehead piercing his chest above the nipple plunged deep in his lung , and thoas , running up , wrenched the heavy spear from the man 's chest , drew his blade , ripped him across the belly , took his life but he could not strip his armor
1	closing ranks we charge after him , into the thick of battle and face our first disaster
1	a happy hope flared up in the last two captains now , sergestus and mnestheus , to pass the flagging gyas
1	and now apollo turned to taunt achilles : why are you chasing me ?
1	at that command the dream went winging off , and passing quickly along the fast trim ships , made for the king and found him soon , sound asleep in his tent with refreshing godsent slumber drifted round him
1	she had no love for great acestes ’ city
1	i am certain he has not heard the dreadful news that his dear friend lies dead
1	that unholy man , so blind in his lust for gold he ran him through with a sword , then hid the crime for months , deaf to his sister ’ s love , her heartbreak
1	my courage renewed , i rush to relieve the palace , brace the defenders , bring the defeated strength
1	a call to arms and they pack in wedge formation bent on battle , advancing toward the walls in a dense fighting mass— in a moment you see ladders slanted , brands aflame
1	but the ocean king who grips and shakes the earth , rising up from the offshore swell , urged the argives , taking the build and tireless voice of calchas
1	and iris came on helen in her rooms
1	hector with that flashing helmet would meet his match in combat in a moment
1	we are all friends here — let me tell it now
1	oh escape from this savage land , i beg you , flee these grasping shores !
1	not when i loved acrisius ' daughter danae — marvelous ankles — and perseus sprang to life and excelled all men alive
1	no qualm in your heart for this ?
1	nor did i once extend a bridegroom ’ s torch or enter into a marriage pact with you
1	but as for stealing courageous hector 's body , we must abandon the idea — not a chance in the world behind achilles ' back
1	they had just gained the sacred sill when the virgin cries aloud : now is the time to ask your fate to speak !
1	i , betrayed so often by calm , deceptive skies !
1	well , here 's a tremendous work of battle , look , blazing before your eyes and just the sort you longed for all those days
1	and it strikes me , even me , as the better way
1	what good has it been to flee the plague of war , to slip through the thick of fires set by the greeks ?
1	she told no one what she saw , not even her sister
1	that spear i hurled is lying here on the ground
1	i warn you , soldiers — so help me it 's the truth — i will crush you with body-blows , i will crack your ribs to splinters !
1	and he went on to war as grim as murderous ares , his good son panic stalking beside him , tough , fearless , striking terror in even the combat-hardened veteran , yes , both of them marching out of thrace , geared to fight the ephyri or phlegians great with heart , but they turn deaf ears to the prayers of both sides at once , handing glory to either side they choose
1	but the leaves are light—if the door turns on its hinge , the slightest breath of air will scatter them all about and she never cares to retrieve them , flitting through her cave , or restore them to order , join them as verses with a vision
1	no more joy for us in the sumptuous feast when riot rules the day
1	i am glad to do it
1	often the armies brought this matter up against me — they would revile me in public
1	eyes blazing , athena answered , let him die a thousand deaths !
1	hoisting over the blaze a cauldron , filling it brimful with bathing water , they piled fresh logs beneath and lit them quickly
1	turnus , hurling the brothers amycus and diores off their mounts , attacks them on foot and one he strikes with a long spear , rushing at turnus , one he runs through with a sword and severing both their heads , he dangles them from his car as he carts them off in triumph dripping blood
1	is that why you beckon here beside me now with all the immortal cunning in your heart ?
1	or so they claim who watched him at his work
1	helen paused and the shrewd antenor carried on her story : straight to the point , my lady , very true
1	shorter than atreus ' son agamemnon , clearly , but broader across the shoulders , through the chest
1	the chiefs in the lead , messapus , ufens , mezentius , scorner of gods , call up forces from all quarters and strip the fields of men who worked the soil
1	now amarinceus ' son diores — fate shackled diores fast and a jagged rock struck him against his right shin , beside the ankle
1	but if we have lost our haven there , if libyan waters hold you now , my captain , best of the men of troy , and all our hopes for iulus have been dashed , at least we can cross back over sicilian seas , the straits we came from , homes ready and waiting , and seek out great acestes for our king
1	nor did paris linger long in his vaulted halls
1	if only odysseus and rugged diomedes were driving racers off the trojan lines , here , here and fast !
1	and those greeks we had put to rout , our ruse in the murky night stampeding them headlong on throughout the city—back they come , the first to see that our shields and spears are naked lies , to mark the words on our lips that jar with theirs
1	the lord of men agamemnon answered warmly , son of laertes , i delight to hear your counsel !
1	but one man , thersites , still railed on , nonstop
1	inside it was crisscrossed taut with many thongs , outside the gleaming teeth of a white-tusked boar ran round and round in rows stitched neat and tight — a master craftsman 's work , the cap in its center padded soft with felt
1	they will gladly sink to a knee and rest at home , i would say — whoever comes through alive from the heat of combat , out from under my spear !
1	laying hold of the yoke that bound his team , the goddess pallas started , so , tydeus ' son is half the size of his father , and he was short and slight — but tydeus was a fighter !
1	a laughingstock , shorn of glory , she came crawling in
1	rearing behind him pallas seized his fiery hair — only achilles saw her , none of the other fighters — struck with wonder he spun around , he knew her at once , pallas athena !
1	over them as a backdrop looms a quivering wood , above them rears a grove , bristling dark with shade , and fronting the cliff , a cave under hanging rocks with fresh water inside , seats cut in the native stone , the home of nymphs
1	no sooner were both men harnessed up beneath the roofs , priam and herald , minds set on the coming journey , than hecuba rushed up to them , gaunt with grief , her right hand holding a golden cup of honeyed wine so the men might pour libations forth at parting
1	and the old charioteer rose to the challenge
1	they are bone-weary from battle — you could roll those broken trojans back to troy , clear of our ships and shelters !
1	they toed the line — and broke flat out from the start and ajax shot ahead with quick odysseus coming right behind him , close as the weaver 's rod to a well-sashed woman 's breast when she deftly pulls it toward her , shooting the spool across the warp , still closer , pressing her breast — so close odysseus sprinted , hot on ajax ' heels , feet hitting his tracks before the dust could settle and quick odysseus panting , breathing down his neck , always forcing the pace and all the argives shouting , cheering him on as he strained for triumph , sprinting on and fast in the homestretch , spurting toward the goal odysseus prayed in his heart to blazing-eyed athena , hear me , goddess , help me — hurry , urge me on !
1	and what of your son , ascanius ?
1	at once he summons his friends , acestes first , to report the will of jove , his dear father ’ s commands and the firm resolve now settled in his mind
1	and now your honor preserves your resting place , and if such glory is any glory at all , your name marks out your bones in the great land of the west
1	so i can go at the trojans once again and test their strength and see if they still long to camp the night at the ships
1	seeing atrides hurt and speeding off the lines he gave a ringing shout to his troops and allies : trojans !
1	so come , young soldiers , welcome to our house
1	she is the last , they say , our mother earth produced
1	as a dust storm dark as night goes whirling toward the walls , the mothers stand at the lookouts , beating their breasts , raising the women ’ s shrilling wails to the starry sky
1	now throw helicon open , muses , launch your song !
1	she paused but zeus who commands the storm clouds answered nothing
1	this was the first cause of all the pain and struggle , this first kindled the country people ’ s lust for war
1	you see for yourself — no power left in the argives
1	i heard that you were dead
1	look at this fellow here , back he comes again , fleeing his fatal day — and i would sold him off as a slave in holy lemnos but the heaving gray salt sea ca not hold him back , though it stops whole fleets of men who buck its tides
1	not even devouring a city , the heart of the phrygian race , in all her hatred , dragging the remnant down through pains of every sort : it ’ s not enough for her
1	at other points on the line i have no fear of the trojans ' hands , invincible as they seem — troops who had stormed our massive wall in force — our men-at-arms will hold them all at bay
1	and his loving wife went home , turning , glancing back again and again and weeping live warm tears
1	and then to any power above , mindful , evenhanded , who watches over lovers bound by unequal passion , dido says her prayers
1	only this : the argives certain they would never flee the worst , they would perish then and there , but the hopes soared in every trojan 's heart to torch the ships and slaughter argive heroes — so ran their thoughts , closing for the kill
1	no one can get his fill of gazing at those eyes , terrible eyes , that face , the matted , bristling chest of the brute beast , its fiery maw burnt out
1	with that he stabbed at odysseus ' balanced shield , straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked and it flayed the skin clean off odysseus ' ribs but pallas athena would never let it pierce her hero 's vitals
1	he marched out at once and came on crowds , menacing bands of thebans feasting away in the halls of mighty eteocles
1	many a victim will fall before your altars , we ’ ll slaughter them for you !
1	and moved at the sight , the good soldier patroclus burst out in grief with a flight of winging words , poor men !
1	what disgrace — a marvel right before my eyes !
1	so i was saved from the deep , the shores of the strophades first to take me in
1	be that fighter you claimed to be in all the years gone by
1	is it all lost now ?
1	beat him back , quickly !
1	the end closed in around him , swirling down his eyes , choking off his breath
1	how he rejoiced that day , questioning me in his halls , when he learned the blood and birth of all the argives
1	this is the gear your brother eryx used to wield , look , still crusted with blood and spattered brains— with these he stood up against great hercules , and i used to wear them too , when the blood ran warmer in me , made me strong before old age , my rival , flecked my brows with gray
1	then and there he would have struck achilles lunging in , the rock would have hit him square in casque or shield , the gear would have warded off grim death , and achilles , closing , would have slashed his life away with a well-honed blade — if the god of earthquakes had not marked it quickly and called the gods at once who grouped around him : now , i tell you , my heart aches for great aeneas !
1	and then , with the holy rites performed in full , they turned back to the city
1	you will never take the prize unless you take the oath !
1	dread what comrades say of you here in bloody combat !
1	and now aeneas sees in the valley ’ s depths a sheltered grove and rustling wooded brakes and the lethe flowing past the homes of peace
1	in high spirits alert your men and arm them , move them out through the gates to the field of battle !
1	escaping that flood and sailing here over many barren seas , now all we ask is a modest resting place for our fathers ’ gods , safe haven on your shores , water , and fresh air that ’ s free for all to breathe
1	and he came on tydeus ' son , impetuous diomedes standing by in his bolted car behind his team with sthenelus flanked beside him , capaneus ' son
1	come , friend , you too must die
1	and now , what 's more , the courage inside my chest is racing faster for action , full frontal assault — feet quiver beneath me , hands high for the onset !
1	constant sprays of dust kept pelting back on the driver , the chariot sheathed in gold and tin careering on in the plunging stallions ' wake , its spinning rims hardly leaving a rut behind in the thin dust as the team thundered in — a whirlwind finish !
1	but now venus distills a deep , soothing sleep into iulus ’ limbs , and warming him in her breast the goddess spirits him off to her high idalian grove where beds of marjoram breathe and embrace him with aromatic flowers and rustling shade
1	you would set him free from all the pains of death ?
1	how they would yearn , now , in the world above to endure grim want and long hard labor !
1	big epeus hefted the iron , swung and heaved it — and comrades burst out laughing
1	and anchises ' gallant son did not resist
1	come — see if we can arm the achaeans for assault
1	they can not see the brow of my helmet flash before their eyes — oh they would soon run for their lives and choke the torrent-beds of the field with all their corpses if only the mighty agamemnon met me with respect : now , as it is , they are fighting round our camp !
1	better for us that way , by far , if we yield his corpse to the stallion-breaking trojans , all to drag him back to troy and win the glory
1	speeding down in a flash from mount olympus ' summit hera reached achaean argos in no time , where , she knew for a fact , the hardy wife of sthenelus , perseus ' own son , was about to bear her child , but only seven months gone
1	for hard on the heels of hector 's death your death must come at once —
1	so they wept , the two of them crying out to their dear son , both pleading time and again but they could not shake the fixed resolve of hector
1	men surrendered their own sweet lives or dragged their decrepit bodies on and on
1	now priam rose in their midst and took his leave : hear me , trojans , achaeans geared for combat — home i go to windy ilium , straight home now
1	i will bring him down tomorrow
1	— then veering away himself , back again to grapple frontline troops
1	you have no mercy , none for dying trojans
1	hardly the sound of joy
1	he urged her on : take flight from our homeland , quick !
1	and hector held fast , he never let go of the high stern , he hugged its horn , arms locked in a death-grip , crying out to trojans , bring fire !
1	and then and there the achaeans would have taken the lofty gates of troy if apollo had not driven prince agenor at them , antenor 's son , a courageous , rugged soldier
1	i swear i will never mutilate you — merciless as you are — if zeus allows me to last it out and tear your life away
1	where ’ s he rushing now ?
1	and now it was ajax ' turn to shout at brave polydamas , think it over , polydamas , tell the truth , my friend — a decent bargain , no ?
1	perceiving at once that this was all pretense , a ruse to shift the kingdom of italy onto libyan shores , venus countered juno : now who ’ d be so insane as to shun your offer and strive with you in war ?
1	how long i have yearned to tell you , show them to you , face-to-face , yes , as i count the tally out of all my children ’ s children
1	if i voyage back to the fatherland i love , my pride , my glory dies
1	and across the onslaught zeus swept murderous night to make the pitched battle over his own dear son a brutal , blinding struggle
1	fight this way , if the argives still obey you , then you can see which captain is a coward , which contingent too , and which is loyal , brave , since they will fight in separate formations of their own
1	and hera endured it too , that time amphitryon 's son , mighty heracles hit her deep in the right breast with a three-barbed shaft , and pain seized her , nothing calmed the pain
1	those were my very thoughts , winging down from olympus into the midst of trojans and achaeans
1	what to commend first ?
1	i claim i am far greater than he in striking force , i am the first-born too
1	and once the surf had scoured the thick caked sweat from their limbs and the two fighters cooled , their hearts revived and into the polished tubs they climbed and bathed
1	his eyes narrow , gauging the length his spear will need , he cries : let this right arm—my only god—and the spear i hurl be with me now !
1	never pausing , the swift runner sprang to his feet and slaughtered a white sheep as comrades moved in to skin the carcass quickly , dress the quarters well
1	many were wounded , flesh ripped by the ruthless bronze whenever some fighter wheeled and bared his back but many right through the buckler 's hide itself
1	and yet minerva could burn the fleet to ash and drown my argive crews in the sea , and all for one , one mad crime of a single man , ajax , son of oileus !
1	patroclus slashed his right shoulder and down he went , his back slamming the dust with a jolting groan as companions panicked round him — brave paeonians — patroclus whipped the terror in all their hearts when he killed the chief who topped them all in battle
1	what agonies must i suffer now , now you are dead and gone ?
1	then nothing could keep me there , my blood so fired up
1	i ’ d grant that to the living too
1	a rout — not even the die-hard lycians stood their ground , they all scattered in panic , down to the last man when they saw their royal king speared in the heart , sarpedon sprawled there in the muster of the dead , for men by the squad had dropped across his corpse once zeus stretched tight the lethal line of battle
1	remind him i was never at aulis , never swore a pact with the greeks to rout the trojan people from the earth !
1	so the old man told you
1	the goddess ' voice — he knew it , mounted at once as odysseus whacked the stallions smartly with his bow and they made a run for achaea 's rapid ships
1	and now they would have jumped up , gone for the third fall if achilles himself had not stepped in and stopped them : no more struggling — do not kill yourselves in sport !
1	such fury ’ s beyond me— no doubt she has her reasons
1	saturn ’ s son , the king of the deep , complied : by all rights , cytherea , you should trust my realm , it gave you birth
1	no joining ranks with us as we fight to wipe them out , these insolent trojans , stretch them out in the dust with all their sons and all their honored wives !
1	so come , wait while i get this war-gear on , or you go on ahead and i will follow — i think i can overtake you
1	the first to hold a consul ’ s power and ruthless axes , then , when his sons foment rebellion against the city , their father summons them to the executioner ’ s block in freedom ’ s noble name , unfortunate man
1	so the front gave ground and flashing hector too , though only as far as a long slim spear can fly when a man tests his hurling strength in the games or in war when enemy fighters close to crush his life — so far the trojans gave as the argives drove them back
1	they lifted off its hook a boxwood yoke for the mules , its bulging pommel fitted with rings for guide-reins , brought out with the yoke its yoke-strap nine arms long and wedged the yoke down firm on the sanded , tapered pole , on the front peg , and slipped the yoke-ring onto its pin , strapped the pommel with three good twists , both sides , then lashed the assembly round and down the shaft and under the clamp they made the lashing fast
1	so he prayed , grasping the altar while the sibyl gave her answer : born of the blood of gods , anchises ’ son , man of troy , the descent to the underworld is easy
1	put your mind at rest
1	be on your guard
1	following them comes aventinus , handsome hercules ’ handsome son , parading his victor ’ s team across the field , his chariot crowned with the victor ’ s palm , his shield emblazed with his father ’ s sign : the hydra ’ s hundred snakes , the serpents twisting round
1	but make this glorious hector your main concern , rouse his breakneck courage till , racing in terror , the argives reach the fleet and the hellespont in rout
1	we blanch at the sight , we scatter
1	these were the words that fanned her sister ’ s fire , turned her doubts to hopes and dissolved her sense of shame
1	and achilles placed the trophy in nestor 's hands
1	headlong down aeneas smashes the braggart with a rock , a whirling boulder ’ s power that splays him on the ground , snarled in the reins and yoke as the wheels roll him on and under their thundering hoofbeats both his galloping horses— all thought of their master vanished—trample him to death
1	cut off from you with a charge like that , dear boy ?
1	or follow them out with all my troops of tyrians thronging the decks ?
1	and soon he came to priam 's palace , that magnificent structure built wide with porches and colonnades of polished stone
1	evadne , pasiphaë , and laodamia walking side by side , and another , a young man once , a woman now , caeneus , turned back by fate to the form she bore at first
1	so long as he sees lord marshal agamemnon storming among the champions , mowing columns down in blood , hector must hold back , command the rest of his men to fight the enemy , stand their headlong charge
1	like a girl , a baby running after her mother , begging to be picked up , and she tugs her skirts , holding her back as she tries to hurry off — all tears , fawning up at her , till she takes her in her arms
1	but over against him came achilles rearing like some lion out on a rampage , and a whole town of men has geared for the hunt to cut him down : but at first he lopes along , all contempt , till one of the fast young hunters spears him — then
1	but rousing himself from sleep , the divine voice swirling round him , atrides sat up , bolt awake , pulled on a soft tunic , linen never worn , and over it threw his flaring battle-cape , under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals , across his shoulder slung his silver-studded sword
1	the fighter turned on his heels and took his stand , once he reached that wedge of argive comrades
1	soaring home to olympus , she rejoined the gods aloft in the halls of zeus whose shield is thunder
1	so they harangued each other to a standstill
1	antilochus listened closely , hating every word
1	neither father almighty nor the fates were dead against troy ’ s standing any longer or priam ’ s living on for ten more years
1	brilliant achilles can drive them out of ilium now !
1	down they crash on the sea , the eastwind , southwind , all as one with the southwest ’ s squalls in hot pursuit , heaving up from the ocean depths huge killer-breakers rolling toward the beaches
1	like a mother bird hurrying morsels back to her unfledged young — whatever she can catch — but it 's all starvation wages for herself
1	can you see that sentry crouched at the entrance ?
1	grim repose and an iron sleep press down his eyes and shut their light in a night that never ends
1	with that prayer , she poured a libation to the gods , tipping wine on the board , and tipping it , she was first to take the bowl , brushing it lightly with her lips , then gave it to bitias—laughing , goading him on and he took the plunge , draining the foaming bowl , drenching himself in its brimming , overflowing gold , and the other princes drank in turn
1	men — let one of them die , another live , however their luck may run
1	but no , no joy did even powerful hyperenor , breaker of horses , get from his young strength when he scorned me , stood up to me , reviling me as the weakest fighter in all achaea 's armies
1	you have destroyed your life , my sister , mine too , your people , the lords of sidon and your new city here
1	and now with a deep groan and pounding both thighs asius son of hyrtacus cried in anguish , father zeus — so even you are an outright liar after all !
1	and helen of argos ?
1	now here turnus heads , by a track he knows by heart and staking his ground , he lurks in the woods , in ambush
1	what a price in bloodshed , turnus , you will pay me soon !
1	better that way by far , to journey home in the beaked ships of war
1	but you launch out on your journey , tear your sword from its sheath , aeneas
1	with that she flung a torch at the prince and drove it home in his chest to smoke with a hellish black glare
1	juno replies in tears : what if your heart should grant what you begrudge in words , and the life of turnus were firmly set for years to come ?
1	and i , i was the first to let my anger flare
1	as a father weeps when he burns his son 's bones , dead on his wedding day , and his death has plunged his parents in despair
1	down he leapt from his chariot fully armed , hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face
1	men went cramming back to the safe side , back from the killing heat but under the sudden lurch of weight the tower came toppling down , making the whole wide heaven thunder back its crash
1	this head—it ’ s all you bring me back , my son ? — it ’ s all that i followed , crossing land and sea ?
1	so with a shout he surged ahead and his gallant cohort followed
1	hector missed nothing — that was a goddess ' call
1	writhe with shame at the thought patroclus may be sport for the dogs of troy !
1	would to god they had
1	but we dissolved in tears , my wife , creusa , ascanius , the whole household , begging my father not to pull our lives down with him , adding his own weight to the fate that dragged us down
1	when the time arrives to crown your words with action
1	oh you return to your father , his great grief and glory !
1	if only jove is with us now , the third dawn will find us beached on the shores of crete
1	but now 's the time for the younger men to lock in rough encounters , time for me to yield to the pains of old age
1	but a whole battalion marching out of the camp comes massing hard against him—not even juno dares reinforce his power to counterattack
1	myself , if the gods on high had wished me to live on , they would have saved my palace for me here
1	but the queen from her high tower , catching sight of the morning ’ s white glare , the armada heading out to sea with sails trimmed to the wind , and certain the shore and port were empty , stripped of oarsmen— three , four times over she beat her lovely breast , she ripped at her golden hair and oh , by god , she cries , will the stranger just sail off and make a mockery of our realm ?
1	and a brace of fighters , chromius , strong aretus flanked their attack and the trojans had high hopes of killing the men and driving off the massive stallions
1	like a bull rising head and shoulders over the herds , a royal bull rearing over his flocks of driven cattle — so imposing was atreus ' son , so zeus made him that day , towering over fighters , looming over armies
1	flimsy and futile , not worth a second thought
1	be kind , whoever you are , relieve our troubled hearts
1	down in a mass the trojans pounded — hector led them in , charging in as a heavy surf roars in against the rip at a river 's mouth , swelled with rains from zeus , and on either side the jutting headlands bellow back at the booming sea with matching thunder — in they came , the trojans roaring in
1	where raging hector lies , pierced by achilles ’ spear , where mighty sarpedon lies , where the simois river swallows down and churns beneath its tides so many shields and helmets and corpses of the brave !
1	i myself am a stranger , utterly at a loss , trekking over this wild libyan wasteland , forced from europe , asia too , an exile— venus could bear no more of his laments and broke in on his tale of endless hardship : whoever you are , i scarcely think the powers hate you : you enjoy the breath of life , you ’ ve reached a tyrian city
1	or weeping over the argives , are you ?
1	standing far from the war and all its heartbreak hector exchanged his armor , handing his own gear to his battle-hungry troops to return to holy troy , and donned the deathless arms of peleus ' son achilles , arms the gods of the sky once gave his loving father — and peleus passed them on to his son when he grew old but the son would not grow old in his father 's armor
1	lunging she kills a pair of massive trojans , butes and orsilochus
1	and the powerful polypoetes ' men sprang up to bear the king 's trophy back to their hollow ships
1	antenor could slip out from under the greek siege , then make his passage through the illyrian gulfs and , safe through the inlands where the liburnians rule , he struggled past the timavus river ’ s source
1	hold firm with me — we will fight this wild maniac off the old man here !
1	an average man would strain to lift it off the table when it was full , but nestor , old as he was , could hoist it up with ease
1	all launch in as one , whipping the whole sea to foam with tugging , thrashing oars and cleaving triple beaks as they make a run for open sea
1	filled with resolve , he braced , waiting achilles , his warrior blood incensed
1	— neither i nor your wife , that warm , generous woman
1	turnus , surrender to king and country their due rights !
1	why , i have amathus , paphus ’ heights , and cythera too , an idalian mansion—there with his weapons laid away , let him live his life out , all unsung
1	nor does the spirit urge me on that way
1	in silence they piled the corpses on the pyre , their hearts breaking , burned them down to ash and returned to sacred troy
1	i am splattered with blood and filth — how could i pray to the lord of storm and lightning ?
1	it did bore through two plies but three were left , since the crippled smith had made it five plies thick with two of bronze on the outside , inside two of tin , between them one of gold where the ashen spear held fast
1	that 's what we need now , you and i both , and cunning tactics too
1	while vulcan , the lord of lemnos , spurs the work below that aeolian coast , the life-giving light and birdsong under the eaves at crack of dawn awake evander from sleep in his humble lodge
1	her wails dashed their spirits , a spasm of sorrow went throbbing through them all
1	some god will grant us an end to this as well
1	and the love you bore me once , where has it all gone ?
1	her armies have taken heart
1	it ’ s no long journey
1	i am achilles ' aide , you see , one and the same good warship brought us here
1	they are calling for you now , commanders of both armies , stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze — come down to the plain so you can seal our oaths
1	the right time for war will come—don ’ t rush it now— one day when savage carthage will loose enormous ruin down on the roman strongholds , breach and unleash the alps against her walls
1	with that , he whips his warhorse into the press , braced to die himself , he rushes venulus headlong , sweeps him off his mount and hugging his enemy tight to his chest with his clenched right arm , gallops away with him , racing off full tilt
1	both sides of the harbor , rock cliffs tower , crowned by twin crags that menace the sky , overshadowing reaches of sheltered water , quiet and secure
1	but i can see him — i recognize machaon myself , the expert healer
1	they dragged the hero cebriones out from under the pelting shafts and trojans ' piercing cries and they tore the handsome war-gear off his back and patroclus charged the enemy , fired for the kill
1	can ’ t you hear the westwind ruffling to speed you on ?
1	patroclus hurled next , the bronze launched from his hand — no miss , a mortal hit
1	and here anchises , his vision told in full , escorts his son and sibyl both and shows them out now through the ivory gate
1	and the winds swung round and headed home again , over the thracian sea , and the heaving swells moaned
1	worse , there was a marble temple in her palace , a shrine built for her long-lost love , sychaeus
1	they meet and grasp right hands and sitting there in the open court , are free at last to indulge in frank discussion
1	they lifted golden beakers , pledging each other warmly , gazing down on troy
1	at last he ventured a few words : i
1	mid-sea there lies the sacred island of delos , loved by the nereids ’ mother , aegean neptune too
1	odius and epistrophus led the halizonians out of alybe miles east where the mother lode of silver came to birth
1	as soon as idomeneus reached his well-built shelter he strapped his burnished armor round his body , grasped two spears and out he ran like a lightning bolt the father grips and flings from brilliant olympus , a dazzling sign to men — a blinding forked flash
1	go — the achaeans all will honor you like a god !
1	with a deafening roar the trojans all come pouring in through the gates for shelter , mount the ramparts now
1	hector slashed eioneus ' throat with a sharp spear , ripped him under the helmet 's hammered bronze rim — his legs collapsed in death
1	— or must they all die now , beaten down by his spear ?
1	so aeneas says , feeding his spirit on empty , lifeless pictures , groaning low , the tears rivering down his face as he sees once more the fighters circling troy
1	and this , at least , may comfort you for a death so cruel , unlucky boy : you went down under the hand of great aeneas
1	unless it 's a god who smolders at our troops , enraged at a rite we failed — when a god 's enraged there 's thunder at our heads
1	but the son unlike the father , not content with his forebears ’ holdings , even now held sway over broader realms : the sarrastian clans , their meadows washed by the sarnus , men from rufrae , batulum and celemna ’ s farms , and soldiers overseen by the high walls of abella rife with apples , fighters who whirl the barbed lance , teutonic style , their heads wrapped with the bark they strip from cork-trees , bronze shields gleaming—gleaming bronze , their swords
1	if only we lay our hands on these , i am filled with hope they will take to their racing ships this very night !
1	then over his broad brow agamemnon set his helmet fronted with four knobs and forked with twin horns and the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror
1	with equal zeal he rallies messapus , rallies allied chiefs and spurring them into battle , marches on the foe
1	the big oaken axle groaned beneath the weight , bearing a great man and a terrifying goddess — and pallas athena seized the reins and whip , lashing the racing horses straight at ares
1	anchises ' son echepolus gave agamemnon blaze , a gift that bought him off from the king 's armies bound for windy troy : he would stay right where he was , a happy man , since zeus had given him vast wealth and he lived in style on sicyon 's broad dancing rings
1	your love for me , if it held the force it once held and should hold still , you ’ d never deny me this , all-powerful one : the power to spirit turnus clear of battle , save him all unscathed for his father , daunus
1	out with it now , calchas
1	and uncontrollable laughter broke from the happy gods as they watched the god of fire breathing hard and bustling through the halls
1	she rages in helpless frenzy , blazing through the entire city , raving like some maenad driven wild when the women shake the sacred emblems , when the cyclic orgy , shouts of bacchus !
1	but euphorbus who hurled the lethal ashen spear would not neglect his kill , patroclus ' handsome body
1	over and over father , the old spearman lycaon urged me , setting out from his well-built halls , take those teams and cars , he told me , amount up , lead the trojans into the jolting shocks of battle !
1	so now , you see , i have given ground myself and told my comrades to mass around me here
1	both doomed to stain red with our blood the same plot of earth , a world away in troy !
1	i ’ ll take him on , i will !
1	now my spirit stirs me to meet you face-to-face
1	you immortal beasts who never age or die ?
1	no shame in running , fleeing disaster , even in pitch darkness
1	then tactful odysseus led her up to the altar , placing her in her loving father 's arms , and said , chryses , the lord of men agamemnon sent me here to bring your daughter back and perform a sacrifice , a grand sacrifice to apollo — for all achaea 's sake — so we can appease the god who 's loosed such grief and torment on the argives
1	most terrifying man alive !
1	suddenly down from the mountain 's rocky crags poseidon stormed with giant , lightning strides and the looming peaks and tall timber quaked beneath his immortal feet as the sea lord surged on
1	and what 's more , he advises all the rest , 'sail home now
1	he scanned the vaulting skies as his voice rang in prayer : zeus be my witness first , the highest , best of gods !
1	you too , you gods and goddesses , all who could never suffer troy and troy ’ s high glory , spare the people of pergamum now , it ’ s only right
1	the trojans have settled down secure in the tiber channel they so craved , safe from the waves—and me
1	plenty of argive women wait in hellas and in phthia , daughters of lords who rule their citadels in power
1	but aeneas , no less bent on meeting up with the enemy , stalks his victim , circling round him , turn by turn and his shrill cries call him through the broken ranks
1	to him i will give two hundred horsemen now , fighting hearts of oak—our best—and pallas will give you two hundred more , in pallas ’ name
1	then , by heaven , the tireless fire can strike his corpse — the sooner to burn patroclus from our sight — and the men turn back to battles they must wage
1	take back to your king this answer i give you now
1	i pray you , calliope—muses—inspire me as i sing what carnage and death the sword of turnus spread that day , what men each fighter speeded down to darkness
1	their wedding it will be !
1	so aeneas begins , and so latinus follows , eyes lifted aloft , his right hand raised to the sky : i swear by the same , aeneas , earth and sea and stars , by latona ’ s brood of twins , by janus facing left and right , by the gods who rule below and the shrine of ruthless death , may the father hear my oath , his lightning seals all pacts !
1	struggling for breath , you answered , patroclus o my rider , hector !
1	you are no bulwark come out of lycia , i can tell you — no help to trojans here
1	suddenly hercules ignited in rage , in black fury and seizing his weapons and weighted knotted club , he made for the hill ’ s steep heights at top speed
1	the sun went down
1	at once the winds whip up the sea , huge waves heaving , strewing , flinging us down the sheer abyss , the cloudbanks swallowing up the daylight , rain-soaked night wipes out the sky and flash on flash of lightning bursts from the torn clouds— we ’ re whirled off course , yawing blind in the big waves
1	— or heading home to troy , now they have trounced our armies ?
1	it 's not fair when the other gods have launched themselves in war
1	come , raise that scepter and swear you will give me the battle-team and the burnished brazen car that carry great achilles — i will be your spy
1	or you , fabricius , reared from poverty into power ?
1	our ships were no sooner hauled onto dry land , our young crewmen busy with weddings , plowing the fresh soil while i was drafting laws and assigning homes , when suddenly , no warning , out of some foul polluted quarter of the skies a plague struck now , a heartrending scourge attacking our bodies , rotting trees and crops , one whole year of death
1	— now that battle is set to burst in flames between them !
1	mezentius , vaunting , pries the spear from orodes ’ body
1	four times it lurched to a halt at the very brink of the gates—four times the armor clashed out from its womb
1	atreus ’ son , menelaus , right up to the pillars of proteus—long an exile now
1	at once they took two lords of the realm and seized their car , the two good sons of merops out of percote harbor , merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts
1	and a man may say , who sees you streaming tears , 'there is the wife of hector , the bravest fighter they could field , those stallion-breaking trojans , long ago when the men fought for troy
1	now he found himself in the thick of turnus ’ thousands , latin battalions crowding , pressing at all points— as a wild beast snared in a closing ring of hunters , raging against their weapons flings itself at death , staring doom in the face , leaping straight at the spears— just so wild the young soldier leaps at the enemy ’ s center , rushing at death where he sees the spearheads densest
1	racing away , but where ?
1	three times mezentius rides around him , hurling his weapons , keeping the trojan on his left ; three times aeneas wheels round with him , bearing a grisly thicket of lances bristling on his shield
1	but i will go back to the great city of king priam and bring some joy to the men of troy and trojan women trailing their long robes
1	no long hunt for the foe
1	come , up with you , whip an arrow at this invincible menelaus — now !
1	tearing sword from sheath like a lightning flash , he hacks the mooring lines with a naked blade
1	with that , he stamped his left foot on the corpse and stripped away the sword-belt ’ s massive weight engraved with its monstrous crime : how one night , their wedding night , that troop of grooms was butchered , fouling their wedding chambers with pools of blood— all carved by clonus , eurytus ’ son , in priceless gold
1	look , the night comes at last
1	just one is lost
1	you feckless , craven—have you no pity ?
1	in the early days on phrygian ida ’ s slopes when aeneas first built his fleet , gearing up for the high seas , they say the berecynthian mother of gods herself appealed to powerful jove with pleading words : grant this prayer , my son , that your loving mother makes to you , since now you rule on olympus ’ heights
1	lagus , lured on by a harsh fate
1	think : it ’ s not that beauty , helen , you should hate , not even paris , the man that you should blame , no , it ’ s the gods , the ruthless gods who are tearing down the wealth of troy , her toppling crown of towers
1	here venus , over against her , juno gazing down , as tisiphone seethes amid the milling thousands , that livid , lethal fury
1	a mere seven , battered by wind and wave , survived the worst
1	and hector rushed to tear the helmet off his head , snug on amphimachus ' brows , the gallant soldier — hector rushing in and ajax lunged with a spear yet the burnished weapon could not pierce his skin , hector 's whole body was cased in tremendous bronze
1	i hug your knees — mercy !
1	do you bring peace or war ?
1	up with you , son of venus !
1	and the sons of tyrrhus nursed it with father tyrrhus , who kept the royal herds , charged with tending the broad , spreading pastures
1	he killed in a blur of kills — thersilochus , mydon , astypylus , mnesus , thrasius , aenius and ophelestes — still more paeonian men the runner would have killed if the swirling river had not risen , crying out in fury , taking a man 's shape , its voice breaking out of a whirlpool : stop , achilles !
1	cursed in your own courage !
1	no gear for a mortal man to wear , i would say , it 's fit for the deathless gods !
1	i must obliterate every trace of the man , the curse , and the priestess shows the way !
1	he spotted the great and little ajax , gluttons for battle , flanking teucer fresh from his shelter , side-by-side
1	i look for no joy in life—the gods have ruled that out— just to bear the news to my son among the dead
1	or fear to make our home on western soil ?
1	yes , but lausus— weeping comrades are bearing his lifeless body home on his shield , a great soldier taken down by a great wound
1	but those treasures i once hauled home from argos , i will return them all and add from my own stores
1	cattle and fat sheep can all be had for the raiding , tripods all for the trading , and tawny-headed stallions
1	but you , you hold in check that proud , fiery spirit of yours inside your chest !
1	book nineteen : the champion arms for battle
1	three times he charged with the headlong speed of ares , screaming his savage cry , three times he killed nine men
1	others , cloaked in their sacred aprons , brows wreathed in verbena , brought out spring water and sacramental fire
1	as the bull a marauding lion cuts from the herd , tawny and greathearted among the shambling cattle , dies bellowing under the lion 's killing jaws — so now sarpedon , captain of lycia 's shieldsmen , died at patroclus ' hands and died raging still , crying out his beloved comrade 's name : glaucus — oh dear friend , dear fighter , soldier 's soldier !
1	now for courage , now the steady heart !
1	raising his spear , the lord of the war cry drove it home , planting it deep down in the earth that feeds us all and with winning words he called out to glaucus , the young captain , splendid — you are my friend , my guest from the days of our grandfathers long ago !
1	the goddess of the glistening feet replied , yes , my son , you are right
1	they are forging one tremendous shield , one against all the latin spears—welding seven plates , circular rim to rim
1	suddenly , look , a son of priam , polites , just escaped from slaughter at pyrrhus ’ hands , comes racing in through spears , through enemy fighters , fleeing down the long arcades and deserted hallways—badly wounded , pyrrhus hot on his heels , a weapon poised for the kill , about to seize him , about to run him through and pressing home as polites reaches his parents and collapses , vomiting out his lifeblood before their eyes
1	and father beamed , seeing how much i would won , a young soldier out on his first campaign
1	sentries take up posts , squads fronting the trench we dug outside the rampart
1	he will show no mercy , no respect for me , my rights — he will cut me down straight off — stripped of defenses like a woman once i have loosed the armor off my body
1	but soon as they were a spear-cast off or less he saw them — enemies — quick as a flash he sprang , fleeing for dear life — they sprang in pursuit as a pair of rip-tooth hounds bred for the hunt and flushing fawn or hare through a woody glen keep closing for the kill , nonstop and the prey goes screaming on ahead — so odysseus raider of cities and diomedes cut him off from his own lines , coursing him , closing nonstop with the trojan about to break in on the line of sentries , racing fast for the ships — when athena poured fresh strength in tydeus ' son so no achaean could beat him out for the glory of hitting dolon first , diomedes come in second
1	he let go of the spear , he sank back down
1	look , dear friends have come our way — i must be sorely needed now — my dearest friends in all the achaean armies , even in my anger
1	better , pity me , winds !
1	and tyrians join them , bustling through the doors , filling the hall with joy , to take invited seats on brocaded couches
1	now as he scanned across the trojan plain agamemnon marveled in horror at those fires , a thousand fires blazing against the walls of troy , and the shrill of pipes and flutes and low roar of men
1	i won ’ t hold you , i won ’ t even refute you—go ! — strike out for italy on the winds , your realm across the sea
1	but if someone else in the royal halls would curse me , one of your brothers or sisters or brothers ' wives trailing their long robes , even your own mother — not your father , always kind as my own father — why , you would restrain them with words , hector , you would win them to my side
1	what disgrace it will be — shame , cringing shame if not one danaan now steps up to battle hector
1	we claim we are far , far greater than our fathers
1	this is the sum of it
1	never fear my orders
1	then far off in the land of argos you must live , laboring at a loom , at another woman 's beck and call , fetching water at some spring , messeis or hyperia , resisting it all the way — the rough yoke of necessity at your neck
1	so all day long for the men of war the fighting raged , grim and grueling , relentless , drenching labor , nonstop , and the knees , shins and feet that upheld each fighter , their hands , their eyes , ran with the sweat of struggle over the great runner achilles ' steadfast aide-in-arms — an enormous tug-of-war
1	ida the huntress sent him , quick as the wind with spears and winging arrows , and right beside him came his friend , euryalus
1	so some trojan will trumpet — let the great earth gape and take me down that day !
1	the nymph of the sea with sleek and lustrous locks
1	a heavy blow to the argives , one of the brave ones down
1	he fulfills the plans of thetis who cupped his chin in her hand and kissed his knees , begging zeus to exalt achilles scourge of cities
1	the king ushered us into generous colonnades , in the heart of the court we offered bacchus wine and feasted from golden plates , all cups held high
1	the last gifts from your own people
1	her eyes bright , athena soared away and tydeus ' son went charging back to the front line of champions
1	for years now , i ’ ve lingered out my life , despised by the gods , a dead weight to men , ever since the father of gods and king of mortals stormed at me with his bolt and scorched me with its fire
1	there is no fighting defeated men , robbed of the light
1	so they grieved at troy while achaea 's troops pulled back
1	they swung down from their chariots onto earth to hear what hector dear to zeus commanded now
1	why falling back , my brave ones ?
1	but among them stood magnificent paris now , fair-haired helen 's lord , and he came back with a winging burst in answer : stop , antenor !
1	as he fell the enormous elephenor grabbed his feet , chalcodon 's son , lord of the brave-hearted abantes , dragged him out from under the spears , rushing madly to strip his gear but his rush was short-lived
1	but how to begin this current struggle here and see it through , victorious all the way ?
1	menelaus the famous spearman stabbed him right where he stood , the spearpoint pounding his collarbone to splinters
1	all , at least , the deadly spirits have not dragged away
1	it slipped his mind or he failed to care , but what a fatal error !
1	but thoas son of andraemon spurred them on , aetolia 's best by far , skilled with the spear , superb at cut-and-thrust and few achaeans could put him down in debate when the young men vie and struggle over points
1	consents to fight me again , defeated as he is ?
1	your oars should barely shave that rock to port !
1	now see what you have done !
1	from me alone , achilles of all achaeans , he seizes , he keeps the bride i love
1	then aged drances—always quick to attack the young captain , turnus—full of hatred and accusations , breaks forth to have his say : man of troy , great in fame , greater in battle , how can i sing your praises to the skies ?
1	headlong ruin 's massing against us quickly
1	as a lion springs on flocks unguarded , shepherd gone , pouncing on goats or sheep and claw-mad for the kill , so tydeus ' son went tearing into that thracian camp until he would butchered twelve
1	so all on his own diomedes charged the front , lurched to a halt before old nestor 's team and winged a flight of orders at the horseman : old soldier , these young fighters wear you down — your strength goes slack and old age dogs your steps , your driver 's worthless , your horses drag their weight
1	so the fates were spinning out the future
1	and the tuscan fighter , gazing up at the sky and drinking in the air as he returned to his senses , said : my mortal enemy , why do you ridicule me , threaten me with death ?
1	sick with mounting cares he assumes a look of hope and keeps his anguish buried in his heart
1	as you may have noticed , they camp around our walls on every side
1	here they come , full tilt , aeneas and hector , troy 's best men , bearing down on us here — this point of tears and attack !
1	but once he had stripped the corpse the proud runner achilles took his stand in the midst of all the argive troops and urged them on with a flight of winging orders : friends — lords of the argives , o my captains !
1	where am i racing now ?
1	weighing it all , heart and soul , as on they came , waves of trojan shieldsmen crowding him tighter , closing in on their own sure destruction
1	cisseus reared him at home when he was little — his mother 's father who sired the fine beauty theano — but once he hit the stride of his youth and ached for fame , cisseus tried to hold him back , gave him a daughter 's hand but warm from the bridal chamber marched the groom , fired up by word that achaea 's troops had landed
1	athena , eyes blazing , breathed fury in diomedes and he went whirling into the slaughter now , hacking left and right and hideous groans broke from the dying thracians slashed by the sword — the ground ran red with blood
1	bloody ares lunged at it now with giant lance and athena backed away , her powerful hand hefting a boulder off the plain , black , jagged , a ton weight that men in the old days planted there to mark off plowland — pallas hurled that boundary-stone at ares , struck his neck , loosed his limbs , and down he crashed and out over seven acres sprawled the enormous god and his mane dragged in the dust , his armor clashed around him
1	they dropped lots in a bronze helmet , shook it hard and the lot fell to teucer to shoot first
1	saturnian juno says i may not speak a word
1	but orestes burned with love for his stolen bride , spurred by the furies for his crimes , he seized pyrrhus , quite off guard , and butchered him at his father ’ s altar
1	suddenly , in the thick of it all , a young soldier , hands shackled behind his back , with much shouting trojan shepherds were haling him toward the king
1	and back he trips , poor man , stumbling , crashing head over shoulders into the altar rearing behind him there , and messapus , fired up now
1	work out your own defense , he says , you and your captains save the argive armies and the ships
1	up he leapt and raced from the halls , shouting : you , volusus , call your volscian units to arms , move your rutulians out
1	how deep were the groans you uttered , gazing now from the city heights to watch the broad beaches seething with action , the bay a chaos of outcries right before your eyes ?
1	they had come together from every quarter , belongings , spirits ready for me to lead them over the sea to whatever lands i ’ d choose
1	vaunting along the hulls with team and car but never destined to slip past the deadly spirits , never to ride in glory home to windswept troy
1	that far i may go with my words of warning
1	he makes his way to the private quarters of his guest , aeneas , the old veteran bearing in mind their recent talk and the help that he had promised
1	and amidst it all the heaving sea ran far and wide , its likeness forged in gold but the blue deep foamed in a sheen of white and rounding it out in a huge ring swam the dolphins , brilliant in silver , tails sweeping the crests to cut the waves in two
1	meanwhile marshal agamemnon led his commanders , a file of senior chiefs , toward his own lodge and set before them a feast to please their hearts
1	he had lived in pedaeon , before the argives came , and wed a bastard daughter of priam , medesicaste , but once the rolling ships of achaea swept ashore , home he came to troy where he shone among the trojans , living close to priam , who prized him like his sons
1	turnus , first to attack , whirled a flaming torch that stuck in the tower ’ s flanks and whipped by the wind it quickly seized on planking , clinging fast to the doorway ’ s posts it ate away
1	that , or else one of us might stand beside achilles and lend him winning force — his courage must not flag
1	how — stealing behind the trojans ' main lines or meeting up with a god who gave them to you ?
1	he sends the bravest captains to implore you , leaders picked from the whole achaean army , comrades-in-arms that you love most yourself
1	yes , chryses approached the achaeans ' fast ships to win his daughter back , bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand , wound on a golden staff , the wreaths of the god , the distant deadly archer
1	she towered into the sky on balanced wings , cleaving a giant rainbow , flying beneath the clouds
1	now lead the way , wherever your fighting spirit bids you
1	so the captain reported
1	aphrodite fell to her knees , over and over begged her dear brother to lend his golden-bridled team : oh dear brother , help me !
1	an island rises in mid-sea—crete , great jove ’ s own land where the first mount ida rears , the cradle of our people
1	and agamemnon the lord of men could not resist
1	as he tried to mount behind his team the famous spearman stabbed a heavy javelin deep in his right shoulder — he dropped from his war-car , gripped by the hateful dark
1	messapus , keen to disrupt the truce , whips his charger straight at tuscan aulestes , king adorned with his kingly emblems , forcing him back in terror
1	spare the body buried here—spare your own pure hands , don ’ t stain them !
1	achilles rushed with his spear at noble polydorus son of priam
1	up with you — no more lying low !
1	and once they arrived at paris ' sumptuous halls the attendants briskly turned to their own work as helen in all her radiance climbed the steps to the bedroom under the high , vaulting roof
1	and once they had entered the harbor deep in bays they furled and stowed the sail in the black ship , they lowered the mast by the forestays , smoothly , quickly let it down on the forked mast-crutch and rowed her into a mooring under oars
1	agamemnon himself , the lord of men had given them those well-benched ships to plow the wine-dark sea , since works of the sea meant nothing to those landsmen
1	there is a country— the greeks called it hesperia , land of the west , an ancient land , mighty in war and rich in soil
1	and moved now to his depths , the famous runner cried , no , no , my prince , patroclus , what are you saying ?
1	but now beware , or my curse will draw god 's wrath upon your head , that day when paris and lord apollo — for all your fighting heart — destroy you at the scaean gates !
1	so with my father , peleus
1	what spurs you to rouse the hells of war you ’ ve never known ?
1	if troy had borne two others to match aeneas , trojan troops would have marched on greece ’ s cities , greece would now be grieving , fate turned upside down
1	showers of spears raining from daring , hardy arms went deep into soldiers ' bodies quick to fight but showers of others , cut short halfway before they could graze glistening skin , stuck in the ground , still lusting to sink in flesh
1	not achilles — armored in battle-power down he flung on the trojans , loosed barbaric cries , and his first kill was iphition , otrynteus ' hardy son and a chief of large contingents , born of a river nymph to otrynteus , scourge of towns , below tmolus ' snows in the wealthy realm of hyde
1	at times , when the winter ’ s northwest winds blot out the stars , it ’ s all submerged , the breakers thunder it under
1	what , am i to believe my powers broken down at last , glutted with hatred , now i rest in peace ?
1	that very moment the son of cronus seized his storm-shield — rippling and flaring bright — and shrouding ida in dark clouds , loosed a bolt with a huge crack of thunder , shook the shield , gave the trojans triumph and routed fear-struck argives
1	halys next , he sends him packing along with comrades , phegeus too , as a spear impales him through his shield , then men on the ramparts keen for combat , blind to turnus who picks them off , alcander and halius , prytanis and noëmon
1	the helmed aeantes could no more frighten hector , the proud son of priam , back from patroclus ' corpse than shepherds out in the field can scare a tawny lion off his kill when the hunger drives the beast claw-mad
1	i , by god , i would drive our argives into battle now , starving , famished , and only then , when the sun goes down , lay on a handsome feast — once we have avenged our shame
1	it would be wrong , disgraceful to share that coward 's bed once more
1	the force of the blow still overwhelmed his senses
1	but zeus hates me now
1	just as , all too often , some huge crowd is seized by a vast uprising , the rabble runs amok , all slaves to passion , rocks , firebrands flying
1	then on he went for isus and antiphus , killed and stripped the two sons of priam , one a bastard , one royal blood and both riding a single car , the bastard driving , the famous antiphus standing poised beside him
1	death cut him short
1	it was all that matchless god , sleek-haired leto 's son — he killed him among the champions and handed hector glory
1	the skin of the coward changes color all the time , he ca not get a grip on himself , he ca not sit still , he squats and rocks , shifting his weight from foot to foot , his heart racing , pounding inside the fellow 's ribs , his teeth chattering — he dreads some grisly death
1	archery next — and again achilles set out iron , dark gray trophies , ten double-headed axes , ten with single heads
1	but where are they now ?
1	that is the blood i claim , my royal birth
1	no doubt you bragged that you could hold your city without an army and trojan allies — all on your own , just with your sister 's husbands and your brothers
1	perhaps — but he must be fast — he can bring the body safely back to his ship , stripped as patroclus is — hector with that flashing helmet has his armor
1	feast her eyes on her husband , parents , children too ?
1	she closed with a dive and drove the tall ship on with her right hand—how well she knew the ropes !
1	hold back our retreating mobs outside the gates before they throw themselves in their women 's arms in fear , a great joy to our enemies closing for the kill
1	here were the best picked men detached in squads to stand the trojan charge and shining hector : a wall of them bulked together , spear-by-spear , shield-by-shield , the rims overlapping , buckler-to-buckler , helm-to-helm , man-to-man massed tight and the horsehair crests on glittering helmet horns brushed as they tossed their heads , the battalions bulked so dense , shoulder-to-shoulder close , and the spears they shook in daring hands packed into jagged lines of battle — single-minded fighters facing straight ahead , achaeans primed for combat
1	no more standing round like bragging boys — someone will dress us down , and roughly too
1	and next he wings from afar a deadly spear at magus ducking under it , quick , as the quivering shaft flies past and magus , hugging aeneas ’ knees , implores : i beg you now by your father ’ s ghost , by your hopes for rising iulus , spare this life of mine for my father and my son !
1	and that , that 's why the heart inside me aches when i hear our trojans heap contempt on you , the men who bear such struggles all for you
1	but then some bully with both his parents living beats him from the banquet , fists and abuses flying : 'you , get out — you have got no father feasting with us here !
1	fifty sons i had when the sons of achaea came , nineteen born to me from a single mother 's womb and the rest by other women in the palace
1	have you a favorite mortal man there too ?
1	ah , but evander , you will never see him retreat , hit by a shameful wound , never pray for a father ’ s wretched death , disgraced by a son who still lives safely on
1	whoever will dare — what glory he can win — a night patrol by the ships to learn at once if the fleet 's still guarded as before or now , battered down at our hands , huddling together , they plan a quick escape , their morale too low to mount the watch tonight — bone-weary from battle
1	you too , you twins , went down on latian fields , thymber , larides , daucus ’ sons : identical twins , an endearing puzzlement to your parents till pallas made a strict distinction between you
1	italy waits you now , look , sail on and make it yours !
1	and he forged a thriving vineyard loaded with clusters , bunches of lustrous grapes in gold , ripening deep purple and climbing vines shot up on silver vine-poles
1	so turnus bursts through the fractured ranks , charging toward the walls where the earth runs red with blood and the winds hiss with spears and , hand flung up , he cries with a ringing voice : hold back now , you rutulians !
1	and aetolia 's elders begged meleager , sent high priests of the gods , pleading , 'come out now !
1	no slowing down , i tell you , we must strike at once !
1	and so , both harnessed up in the grim gear of war , the two men moved out , leaving behind them all the captains clustered on the spot
1	setting out from the harbor , leaving ships and shore i chanced to see andromache pouring out libations to the dead—the ritual foods , the gifts of grief— in a grove before the city , banked by a stream the exiles made believe was simois river
1	they tell me menoetius , actor 's son , is still alive , and peleus , aeacus ' son , lives on among his myrmidons — if both our fathers had died , we would have some cause for grief
1	and now the great runner remembered one more duty
1	but hector all afire , blazing head to foot , charged at their main force , bursting down as a wave bursts down on a veering ship , down from under the clouds it batters , bred by gale-winds — showers of foam overwhelm the hull , blot it all from sight , the hurricane 's killing blast thundering into the sails and scudding clear of death by the skin of their teeth the sailors quake , their hearts race on with terror — so the achaeans ' courage quaked
1	but hordes of men fought on , the achaean and trojan infantry going hand-to-hand
1	dead in his tracks he stopped , terrified , stammering , teeth chattering in his mouth , bled white with fear as the two men overtook him and panting hard , yanked and pinned his arms
1	and let us heap a single great barrow over the pyre , one great communal grave stretched out across the plain and fronting it throw up looming ramparts quickly , a landward wall for ships and troops themselves
1	the father of gods and king of men convenes a council high in his starry home , as throned aloft he gazes down on the earth , the trojan camp and latian ranks
1	these gates , evander says , as he reaches his lodge , hercules in his triumph stooped to enter here
1	they ’ ve plundered the hearthfires , sooty torches ignite a murky glare , and the god of fire hurls at the skies a swirl of sparks and ash
1	a mystery— but the trojans know the pains of a great love defiled , and the lengths a woman driven mad can go , and it leads their hearts down ways of grim foreboding
1	a sudden darkness had swept across the earth and hermes was all but on them when the herald looked up , saw him , shouted at once to priam , danger , my king — think fast !
1	when tall hector with that flashing helmet of his kept slaughtering argives pinned against our ships — how could i once forget that madness , that frenzy , the ruin that blinded me from that first day ?
1	now your father and noble mother will never close your eyes in death — screaming vultures will claw them out of you , wings beating your corpse !
1	doomed theseus sits on his seat and there he will sit forever
1	while latinus rules , you ’ ll never lack rich plowland , bounty great as troy ’ s
1	then the abyss , tartarus itself plunges headlong down through the darkness twice as far as our gaze goes up to olympus rising toward the skies
1	wasting time in libya—what hope misleads you so ?
1	there in the halls her father and mother always called cleopatra halcyon , after the seabird 's name
1	zeus planted a killing doom within us both , so even for generations still unborn we will live in song
1	aeolus warmed to juno ’ s offer : yours is the task , my queen , to explore your heart ’ s desires
1	no , my friend , i have no desire to fight the blithe immortals
1	the eagle of jove had just swooped down on them all from heaven ’ s heights and scattered them into open sky , but now you can see them flying trim in their long ranks , landing or looking down where their friends have landed— home , cavorting on ruffling wings and wheeling round the sky in convoy , trumpeting in their glory
1	i ’ m set on fighting aeneas hand-to-hand , set , however bitter it is , to meet my death
1	since now you have spared my life
1	— he 's destroyed my best son !
1	one and the same lot for the man who hangs back and the man who battles hard
1	while zeus on the heights sat poised to thunder orders
1	he was not your father , the horseman peleus — thetis was not your mother
1	and off to the left of battle she discovered ares , violent ares sitting there at ease , his long spear braced on a cloudbank , flanked by racing stallions
1	now , while the gods had still kept clear of mortal men , the achaeans kept on gaining glory — great achilles who held back from the brutal fighting so long had just come blazing forth
1	and turnus in matchless fury gears himself for war
1	no , odysseus , let him rack his brains with you and the other captains how to fight the raging fire off the ships
1	so tribe on tribe , pouring out of the ships and shelters , marched across the scamander plain and the earth shook , tremendous thunder from under trampling men and horses drawing into position down the scamander meadow flats breaking into flower — men by the thousands , numberless as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring
1	you will be marcellus
1	now go , our glory of troy , go forth and enjoy a better fate than mine
1	but here ’ s drances , feigning terror at my rebukes , a scoundrel ’ s shabby dodge , just to hone his charges hurled against me !
1	you took the final measure with a sword
1	then , from that point on he would thrust the trojans breakneck back from the fleet and give the argives glory
1	if without your assent , against your will the trojans have reached italy , let them pay for their latest outrage , never grant them rescue
1	let him bluster there and play the king in his court , let aeolus rule his bolted dungeon of the winds !
1	the dove settled onto the mast of the dark-prowed ship , her neck wrenched awry , her beating wings went slack and life breath flew from her limbs that instant — down she dropped , a long drop down to the ground
1	he sat up with a start and made his wishes known : atrides — chiefs of achaea 's united forces — first put out the fires with glistening wine , wherever the flames still burn in all their fury
1	kept alive by your death ?
1	achilles , filled with rage , addressed his own great heart : by heaven , an awesome miracle right before my eyes !
1	at last hector grappled a ship 's stern , a beauty built for speed — it swept the seas with protesilaus , bore him to troy but never bore him back to his fatherland again
1	he stopped the fight , pulled the battle-weary dares out of the bout and consoled him with these words : poor man , what insanity ’ s got you in its grip ?
1	and your sword-arm , cretheus , bravest greek afield— it could not snatch you from turnus , nor did the gods he worshipped save cupencus ’ life when aeneas came his way : he thrust his chest at the blade but his brazen shield , poor priest , could not put off his death
1	you too are made of mortal stuff , i would say
1	but captain aeneas , dazed by this swift sharp blow , kept wrestling the overriding anguish in his heart , now this way , that way
1	as for strength in war , zeus lends power to some , others he wastes away , whatever his pleasure — the strongest god of all
1	let alban kings hold sway for all time
1	wait , i will settle things myself
1	his temper can never bend and change — like some lion going his own barbaric way , giving in to his power , his brute force and wild pride , as down he swoops on the flocks of men to seize his savage feast
1	and plenty of argives too — kill them if you can
1	serranus , numa too , and a growing crowd cluster around the dead and dying men , and the ground lies warm with the recent massacre , rivulets foam with blood
1	nine days the arrows of god swept through the army
1	punishing work , you see , to fight the sons of invincible cronus ' son , even sprung from a river as you are !
1	with that , cebriones flogged their sleek team and leaping under the whistling , crackling whip they sped the careering car into both milling armies , trampling shields and corpses , axle under the chariot splashed with blood , blood on the handrails sweeping round the car , sprays of blood shooting up from the stallions ' hoofs and churning , whirling rims
1	now far beyond our reach , now by the argive ships the rushing dogs will tear you , bolt your flesh !
1	the monster ’ s father was vulcan , whose smoky flames he vomited from his maw as he hauled his lumbering hulk
1	a greater tide of events springs up before me now , i launch a greater labor
1	here your home is assured , yes , assured for your household gods
1	that—with priam put to the sword ?
1	the rest sprang to their feet , the sceptered kings obeyed the great field marshal
1	but you , i beg you , comfort her in her frailty , brace her in desolation
1	or still more gold you are wanting ?
1	and at once achilles called his myrmidons keen for battle : belt yourselves in bronze !
1	no , don ’ t press me to face such battles now
1	he twists over , vomiting hot blood from his chest , chill with death , his flanks racked with his last gasps
1	the dead of night
1	at that , opis dove down from the sky through a light breeze , her body wrapped in a whirlwind dark as night and whirring on her way
1	now aeneas , the good captain , enters , then the trojan soldiers , taking their seats on couches draped in purple
1	with that he left her there and made for his bellows , turning them on the fire , commanding , work — to work !
1	rescue caletor before the argives strip his gear — he 's down , he 's dead by the ships that crowd the beach !
1	his driver held them reined off at the side while he advanced through the front ranks on foot , plowing on and on till he lost his own life
1	hector , what help are you to him , now you are dead ?
1	invite him into your councils
1	the wind cries for canvas , the buoyant oarsmen crown their sterns with wreaths
1	he always carried it , layered with hide and ringed with gleaming bronze , fitted with double cross-stays — under it low he hunched and the brazen spear flew past with a grating screech as the shaft grazed the shield
1	his rustic bands escort him now from near and far , the men who live on praeneste ’ s heights , on the fields of gabine juno , men from the anio ’ s icy stream , the hernici ’ s dripping rocks , men you nourish , rich anagnia—bathed in your river , father amasenus
1	now she even stirs the dead , the one realm in the world still left untested , yes , and allecto , suddenly loosed on earth , tears like a maenad through the heart of italian cities
1	and gallant agenor drew the spear from his hand and bound it up in a band of tightly twisted wool , a sling his aide retained for the good commander
1	but agamemnon 's followers grouped together now and as they approached achilles the din and trampling of their feet awoke him
1	for mighty heracles came against us years before , he ground our lives out , killing off our best
1	aeneas marvels at its mass—once a cluster of huts— he marvels at gates and bustling hum and cobbled streets
1	forward , each on his own !
1	high on a gate he carved androgeos ’ death and then the people of athens , doomed—so cruel— to pay with the lives of seven sons
1	suddenly up she rose from the churning surf like mist and settling down beside him as he wept , stroked achilles gently , whispering his name , my child — why in tears ?
1	his head was full of obscenities , teeming with rant , all for no good reason , insubordinate , baiting the kings — anything to provoke some laughter from the troops
1	but never again , he will never rob me blind with his twisting words again !
1	he looks to me like machaon from behind , clearly , machaon head to foot , asclepius ' only son
1	my heart 's pounding , leaping up in my throat , the knees beneath me paralyzed — oh i know it
1	if only his father were here to watch it all in person !
1	quickly , drive our long-haired achaeans to battle now !
1	even king latinus is overwhelmed
1	so he decreed and the son of cronus bowed his craggy dark brows
1	all those burning desires olympian zeus has brought to pass for me — but what joy to me now ?
1	ancaeus of pleuron wrestled against me — down he went
1	with that she breathed in her son tremendous courage then instilled in patroclus ' nostrils fresh ambrosia , blood-red nectar too , to make his flesh stand firm
1	the other 's still afield , standing up to the trojans ' slashing onslaught
1	wasting no words , no time on empty questions , heaving a deep groan from his heart he calls out : escape , son of the goddess , tear yourself from the flames !
1	pelides groaned , scanning the arching blank sky : father zeus !
1	no delay in the face of signs like these
1	but here for the first time fortune veered in its course and turned against the trojans
1	down from his chariot turnus vaulted , nerved to attack the enemy face-to-face on foot
1	but what outrage has mutilated your face so clear and cloudless once ?
1	the cool tactician set the record straight : no , no , nestor — achaea 's greatest glory — any god , if he really set his mind to it , could give us an even finer pair than this
1	you pity the man ?
1	just as in dreams when the nightly spell of sleep falls heavy on our eyes and we seem entranced by longing to keep on racing on , no use , in the midst of one last burst of speed we sink down , consumed , our tongue won ’ t work , and tried and true , the power that filled our body fails—we strain but the voice and words won ’ t follow
1	out they march , young iulus flushed with joy
1	he will leave behind him wife and sons unscathed , his house and estate unharmed — once these argives sail for home , the fatherland they love
1	why this sudden radiance lighting the heavens ?
1	— how to slaughter hordes of achaeans pinned against their ships ?
1	achilles went for asteropaeus fresh from the ford , braced to face him there and brandishing two spears and the xanthus filled the trojan 's heart with courage , the river seething for all the youths achilles slaughtered , chopped to bits in its tide without a twinge of pity
1	denouncing me — my comrades , clustered together , always grumbling
1	at the sight an icy sweat goes rippling down my body , i tear myself from bed , i raise my hands and voice in prayer to the skies and tip a pure , unmixed libation on the hearth
1	too well i know the beat of your wings , the drumbeat of doom
1	while mother and son agreed among the clustered ships , trading between each other many winged words , father zeus sped iris down to sacred troy : quick on your way now , iris , shear the wind !
1	hard by his team and car she found the king , cooling the wound that pandarus ' arrow dealt him
1	they spread the gates and rammed the doorbars back and the spreading gates made way for a ray of hope as phoebus apollo hurtled forth to meet achilles , to fight disaster off the trojan troops
1	i have never noticed you on the lines where we win glory , not till now
1	so now you listen too
1	but if , in fact , we capture italy , seize the scepter in triumph , allot the plunder
1	but if , later , the gods allow us to plunder the great city of priam , you shall enter in when we share the spoils , load the holds of your ship with gold and bronze — as much as your heart desires — and choose for your pleasure twenty trojan women second only to argive helen in their glory
1	the old surgeon , his robe tucked back and cinched in the healer ’ s way , with his expert , healing hands and apollo ’ s potent herbs he works for all he ’ s worth
1	it ’ s dark there , gaps in their watchfires , smoke blackens the sky
1	you will meet your doom at once , beaten down by achilles , so much stronger than you — that hard , headlong man
1	she will reveal to you the italian tribes , the wars that you must fight , and the many ways to shun or shoulder each ordeal that you must meet
1	now take my son — or was he all a dream ?
1	and the crippled smith brought all his art to bear on a dancing circle , broad as the circle daedalus once laid out on cnossos ' spacious fields for ariadne the girl with lustrous hair
1	but once he ’ s embraced aeneas , clung to his neck to sate the deep love of his father , deluded father , cupid makes for the queen
1	on the other side an endless desert , parched earth where the wild barcan marauders range at will
1	in their command sailed forty curved black ships
1	so all through troy the men who had fled like panicked fawns were wiping off their sweat , drinking away their thirst , leaning along the city 's massive ramparts now while achaean troops , sloping shields to shoulders , closed against the walls
1	hector hurled at him — a sudden glint of the spear — but ajax saw it coming and dodged the bronze shaft , just by a hair , and the weapon caught schedius , gallant iphitus ' son and phocia 's finest man , who made his home in the famous town of panopeus , ruling tribes of men
1	clear commands but menoetes , fearing some hidden reefs , veers his prow to starboard , to open water , and gyas shouts again : where now ?
1	third in the vanguard marched euryalus strong as a god , son of king mecisteus son of talaus , but over them all , with cries to marshal men diomedes led the whole force and his argives sailed in eighty long black ships
1	lycia 's captains are bearing down too hard , fierce as they always were in past attacks
1	so on they marched , meriones and idomeneus commanders of armies strode to battle helmed in gleaming bronze , meriones first to ask , son of deucalion , where do you say we join the fighting now ?
1	ares drove them , fiery-eyed athena drove the argives , and terror and rout and relentless strife stormed too , sister of manslaughtering ares , ares ' comrade-in-arms — strife , only a slight thing when she first rears her head but her head soon hits the sky as she strides across the earth
1	but if one denies them , turns them away , stiff-necked and harsh — off they go to the son of cronus , zeus , and pray that ruin will strike the man down , crazed and blinded until he 's paid the price
1	there man killed man in the mad scatter of battle
1	your love for your father lures you into folly
1	but how could he shrink before the enemy , slip back into a crowd of cohorts now ?
1	trojans — the other side on the plain 's high ground — formed around tall hector , staunch polydamas , aeneas loved by the trojans like a god , and antenor 's sons , polybus , prince agenor and acamas still unwed , three men in their prime like gods who never die
1	down she flashed from the peaks of mount olympus , quickly reached the ships and found odysseus first , a mastermind like zeus , still standing fast
1	out went the bow-stones — cables fast astern — and the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf , leading out the sacrifice for the archer god apollo , and out of the deep-sea ship chryseis stepped too
1	the rest of them ?
1	three times he shouted out to aeneas , a great resounding shout , and aeneas knew that voice and his prayer rose up in joy : so grant it , father of gods and high apollo , bring the battle on !
1	the sharp stone crushed both brows , the skull caved in and both eyes burst from their sockets , dropping down in the dust before his feet as the reinsman vaulted , plunging off his well-wrought car like a diver — cebriones ' life breath left his bones behind and you taunted his corpse , patroclus o my rider : look what a springy man , a nimble , flashy tumbler !
1	he warms them in with treasures of the field , he cheers the exhausted men with generous care
1	but the soldiers saw them , rushed them , cut off at a stroke the herds of oxen and sleek sheep-flocks glistening silver-gray and killed the herdsmen too
1	come over here , antilochus , royal prince — this is the old custom
1	now in the homes , in king latinus ’ city that overflowed with wealth , the breaking wails and the long dirges reach their climax
1	hail forever , our great pallas !
1	come , you immortals , think this through
1	but look at them now , like green , defenseless boys or widowed women whimpering to each other , wailing to journey back
1	and down to the last unit all eased off their armor , fine burnished bronze , and released their neighing teams and took their seats by the swift runner achilles ' ship , myrmidons in their thousands , and he set before them all a handsome funeral feast to meet their hearts ' desire
1	that 's your halfway mark where the homestretch starts and there 's plenty of good smooth racing-room around it — it 's either the grave-mound of a man dead long ago or men who lived before us set it up as a goal
1	as frantic as pentheus seeing battalions of furies , twin suns ablaze and double cities of thebes before his eyes
1	here an incredible story meets our ears : that helenus , priam ’ s son , holds sway over these greek towns , that he had won the throne and wife of pyrrhus , son of achilles—andromache was wed once more to a man of trojan stock
1	euphemus led the cicones , fighters armed with spears , son of troezenus , ceas ' son , a warlord bred by the gods
1	but his sister , changed to look like his charioteer , metiscus , handling the car and team and reins , she faced him with this challenge : this way , turnus !
1	to spur a volunteer to spy on trojan lines ?
1	diomedes , true , and his city , arpi , will offer us no relief
1	that left the fifth unclaimed , the jar with double handles
1	we already know your power , far too well
1	you are all witness , look — my prize is snatched away !
1	it seemed an eternity
1	so keep your head , my boy , be on the lookout
1	here its lair , that house of labor , the endless blinding maze , but daedalus , pitying royal ariadne ’ s love so deep , unraveled his own baffling labyrinth ’ s winding paths , guiding theseus ’ groping steps with a trail of thread
1	then to the man whose prowess won him second place he gives a coat of mail , glinting with burnished links and triple-meshed in gold , a victor ’ s trophy he himself had dragged from demoleos , killed near simois ’ rapids under troy ’ s high wall
1	diomedes hurled a spear that struck agastrophus , paeon 's warrior son , and smashed the joint of his hip but his team was not close by for fast escape — a big mistake , the fool
1	but once his soul and the life force have left him , send death to carry him home , send soothing sleep , all the way till they reach the broad land of lycia
1	he brought him down with a glinting jagged rock , massive , top of the heap behind the rampart 's edge , no easy lift for a fighter even in prime strength , working with both hands , weak as men are now
1	i not only fear for our comrade 's body — patroclus will glut the dogs and birds of troy and all too soon — but i fear for my own head , for my own life
1	attack their shattered camp !
1	i have no mind to linger here disgraced , brimming your cup and piling up your plunder
1	not till i hurl the smoke-black halls of priam headlong — torch his gates to blazing rubble — rip the tunic of hector and slash his heroic chest to ribbons with my bronze — and a ruck of comrades round him , groveling facedown , gnaw their own earth !
1	there his warm , generous wife came running up to meet him , andromache the daughter of gallant-hearted eetion who had lived below mount placos rich with timber , in thebe below the peaks , and ruled cilicia 's people
1	not for certain , no , but the leader seems to me an aetolian man by birth — he 's king of the argives , horse-breaking tydeus ' son , rugged diomedes !
1	the radiant queen of sea-nymphs seized a veil , blue-black , no robe darker in all the ocean 's depths , and launched up and away with wind-swift iris leading — the ground swell round them cleaved and opened wide
1	permitted to enter port but never granted a city girded round by ramparts , not before some terrible hunger and your attack on us— outrageous slaughter—drive you to gnaw your platters with your teeth !
1	and dido herself , standing before the altar , holding the sacred grain in reverent hands— with one foot free of its sandal , robes unbound— sworn now to die , she calls on the gods to witness , calls on the stars who know her approaching fate
1	and then , for a fact , the rutulians , trojans , all the italians , those defending the high ramparts , those on attack who batter the walls ’ foundations with their rams : all armies strained to turn their glances round and lifted their battle-armor off their shoulders
1	from old troy we come—troy it ’ s called , perhaps you ’ ve heard the name—sailing over the world ’ s seas until , by chance , some whim of the winds , some tempest drove us onto libyan shores
1	i will offer it up to you — i will sheathe its horns in gold !
1	with the forces poised to clash you tell us to haul our oar-swept vessels out to sea ?
1	king latinus—if he won ’ t yield your bride and keep his word , then he must learn his lesson , taste , at last , the force of turnus ’ sword !
1	zeus commands you to arm your long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now you can take the broad streets of troy !
1	fire her on and cithaeron echoes round with maddened midnight cries
1	but now zeus gave our pylians stunning triumph !
1	come — we will send a detail of picked men
1	but i am off to a lookout point to learn the truth
1	strong diores the son of amarynceus led the third and the princely polyxinus led the fourth , the son of king agasthenes , augeas ' noble stock
1	ah but of course—the fates bar my way
1	so here menelaus paused with much to command meriones and the aeantes : ajax and ajax , captains of achaea , meriones too , remember patroclus now , our stricken comrade !
1	they did not waste a moment , closed at once — ares stabber of shields led off , charging athena , shaking his brazen spear and dressed the goddess down : you dog-fly , why drive the gods to battle once again with that stormy bluster driving your wild heart ?
1	those two alone , athena and hera , sat apart from zeus — not a word would they send his way , not a question
1	but he lunged first , wounding lordly deiopites , spearshaft slicing into the trojan 's shoulder , then cut down thoon and ennomus in their blood , chersidamas next , vaulting down from his car — odysseus caught him up under the bulging shield with a jabbing spear that split him crotch to navel — the man writhed in the dust , hands clutching the earth
1	ah if only it might prove well and good to all , to every immortal god , men might still live on in royal priam 's citadel
1	where are the team and car you always ride ?
1	not even ares , lasher of armies , not even athena watching the battle here could scorn its fury , not even in their most savage lust for combat , no — so tense the work of war for the men and chariot-teams that zeus stretched taut across patroclus this one day
1	but if they give me nothing i will take a prize myself — your own , or ajax ' or odysseus ' prize — i will commandeer her myself and let that man i go to visit choke with rage !
1	you would not find him asleep , not cringing a moment , hanging back from the struggle — he pressed for battle now where men win glory
1	his breastplate could not save him , the bronze he always wore , and the lance impaled his guts — he gasped , convulsed and out of his well-made car the trojan pitched — and as for his team , proud nestor 's son antilochus drove them out of the trojans into argive lines
1	your halls lie under ida , high halls at lyrnesus but here in laurentine soil lies your tomb
1	no more strolling about the halls with father raging
1	right to restore that mislaid sword to turnus— for without your power what could juturna do ? — and lend the defeated strength ?
1	here , as her first step , the priestess steadies four black-backed calves , she tips wine on their brows , then plucks some tufts from the crown between their horns and casts them over the altar fire , first offerings , crying out to hecate , mighty queen of heaven and hell
1	here are your deadly enemies , camping close at hand
1	but i can drag things out , delay the whole affair : that i can do , and destroy them root and branch , the people of either king
1	why not flee headlong ?
1	and he forged the ocean river 's mighty power girdling round the outmost rim of the welded indestructible shield
1	nothing can stop it now
1	now to the ships — now like a pride of man-eating lions the trojan forces stormed the fleet , fulfilling zeus 's strict commands as zeus kept building their fury higher , stunned the argives ' spirit and wrenched away their glory , lashing trojans on
1	— suffer for paris , protect paris , for eternity
1	coming before the lord of storm and lightning the two just stood there , waiting
1	but soon as i reach their hollow ships , torches — do not forget now , one of you bring me lethal fire !
1	the day has returned , if i am not mistaken , the day always harsh to my heart , i ’ ll always hold in honor
1	and in moved ajax now , planted right beside him , bearing that shield of his like a wall , a tower — trojans scattered in panic , bolting left and right while the fighting son of atreus led odysseus through the onslaught , bracing him with an arm till a reinsman drove his team and car up close
1	but hector held firm , staking all on his massive fighting strength — again and again he would hurl himself at the melee , again and again stand fast with piercing cries but he never gave ground backward , not one inch
1	you ’ ll be abandoned now to carrion birds or plunged in the deep sea and swept away by the waves and ravening fish will dart and lick your wounds !
1	but now , look , a whirlwind of fire goes rolling story to story , billowing up the sky , and clings fast to a mobile tower , a defense he built himself of wedged , rough-hewn beams , fitting the wheels below it , gangways reared above
1	as the kings come riding in , a massive four-horse chariot draws latinus forth , his glistening temples ringed by a dozen gilded rays , proof he owes his birth to the sun-god ’ s line , and a snow-white pair brings turnus ’ chariot on , two steel-tipped javelins balanced in his grip
1	the same joy they took in arms and chariots when alive , in currying horses sleek and putting them to pasture , follows them now they rest beneath the earth
1	to cling to your own prize while i sit calmly by — empty-handed here ?
1	all in the same day went down to the house of death , the great godlike runner achilles butchered them all , tending their shambling oxen , shining flocks
1	look , no fortress ardea hugging her native turnus !
1	evander himself and his new trojan allies , share and share alike , slaughter yearling sheep as the old rite demands
1	diores ' son automedon shouted back , alcimedon !
1	a great wail rises up from the deep curved bay as they linger out the night and day in each other ’ s arms
1	what good are prayers and shrines to a person mad with love ?
1	so thetis cried as she left the cave and her sisters swam up with her , all in a tide of tears , and billowing round them now the ground swell heaved open
1	there on the spot the man 's strength and life collapsed and blinding grief for his driver overpowered hector , stunned for his friend but he left him lying there , dead , and swept on , out for another hardy driver
1	but i am willing to give her back , even so , if that is best for all
1	the seer took heart and this time he spoke out , bravely : beware — he casts no blame for a vow we failed , a sacrifice
1	there in the midst , a giant shadowy elm tree spreads her ancient branching arms , home , they say , to swarms of false dreams , one clinging tight under each leaf
1	with that , she cut the lock with her hand and all at once the warmth slipped away , the life dissolved in the winds
1	and paris , magnificent as a god , replied , ah hector , you criticize me fairly , yes , nothing unfair , beyond what i deserve
1	it must have slipped your mind
1	all i bore was doom
1	what forces sail with aeneas fresh from the tuscan shores , manning their ships for battle , sweeping through the waves ?
1	and so , with head bent low , saturn ’ s daughter replied : because i have known your will so well , great jove , against my own i deserted turnus and the earth
1	true , but around his head a mournful shadow flutters black as night
1	our people will live in peace on the rich soil of troy
1	but when triumphant achilles stripped hector ’ s life , the gallant hero joined forces with dardan aeneas , followed a captain every bit as strong
1	quick with treachery noble hera answered , give me love , give me longing now , the powers you use to overwhelm all gods and mortal men !
1	all that i foresee has been decreed
1	hera cleansed her enticing body of any blemish , then she applied a deep olive rub , the breath-taking , redolent oil she kept beside her
1	our blood will put an end to this war at last— that ’ s the field where lavinia must be won !
1	patroclus planted a heel against his chest , wrenched the spear from his wound and the midriff came out with it — so he dragged out both the man 's life breath and the weapon 's point together
1	for that , if my crime against you is so wicked , rip me to bits and fling the bits in the sea , plunge me into the depths !
1	deep in your chest i have put your father 's strength
1	under his command came huge divisions from amiternum , the first quirites , all the ranks from eretum , mutusca green with olives , all who live in nomentum city , the rosean fields by lake velinus , all on tetrica ’ s shaggy spurs and grim-set mount severus , all in casperia , foruli , on the himella river ’ s banks , men who drink the tiber and fabaris , men dispatched from icy nursia , musters from orta , the latin tribes , men that the allia—ominous name—divides as it flows on
1	but once they reached the springs for the fourth time , then father zeus held out his sacred golden scales : in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low — one for achilles , one for hector breaker of horses — and gripping the beam mid-haft the father raised it high and down went hector 's day of doom , dragging him down to the strong house of death — and god apollo left him
1	what heroes sprang into bloom , what weapons blazed , even in those days long ago , in italy ’ s life-giving land ?
1	so , first you must bend your oar in sicilian seas and cross in your ships the salt italian waves , the lakes of the underworld and aeaea , circe ’ s isle , before you can build your city safe on solid ground
1	there are two great jars that stand on the floor of zeus 's halls and hold his gifts , our miseries one , the other blessings
1	and the girls wore robes of linen light and flowing , the boys wore finespun tunics rubbed with a gloss of oil , the girls were crowned with a bloom of fresh garlands , the boys swung golden daggers hung on silver belts
1	andromache , pressing close beside him and weeping freely now , clung to his hand , urged him , called him : reckless one , my hector — your own fiery courage will destroy you !
1	so fight by the ships , all together
1	we turned , looked back at him
1	and give your king this message : power over the sea and ruthless trident is mine , not his—it ’ s mine by lot , by destiny
1	it 's skill , not brawn , that makes the finest woodsman
1	that city , the cause of the war , the heart of latinus ’ realm— unless they bow to the yoke , brought low this very day , i ’ ll topple their smoking rooftops to the ground
1	lord agamemnon rose at once to greet them both with the great tactician odysseus by his side
1	so then and there under royal agamemnon 's hands the two sons of antenor filled out their fates and down they plunged to the strong house of death
1	hector 's speeding horses swept him away , armor and all , leaving his men to face their fate , trojans trapped but struggling on in the deep trench
1	he plows the sea in the bronze-sided tiger
1	— or the deathless gods will strike me down at last at the hands of argive fighters
1	if you honored me last time and heard my prayer and rained destruction down on all achaea 's ranks , now , once more , i beg you , bring my prayer to pass !
1	he turned to asclepius ' son with an urgent , winged word : think , noble machaon , what shall we do now ?
1	but where will it end ?
1	and you , my tyrians , harry with hatred all his line , his race to come : make that offering to my ashes , send it down below
1	a high stabbing cry — and out in the front ranks he drove his plunging stallions
1	no less bloody euryalus ’ work—the man ’ s on fire , storming down on the common ruck before him , fadus , herbesus , rhoetus , abaris , quite unconscious now
1	and now despite their courage the trojan fighters seeing the two sons of dares , one on the run , one dead beside his chariot — all their hearts were stunned
1	surely they can be healed , the hearts of the brave
1	so they charge , trojan aeneas and turnus , son of daunus , shields clang and the huge din makes the heavens ring
1	but nestor the old driver rose and spoke at once : few can match your power in battle , diomedes , and in council you excel all men your age
1	high astern he stands , the twin flames shoot forth from his lustrous brows and rising from the peak of his head , his father ’ s star
1	perhaps he will show us mercy
1	then — with a shrill wail they all stretched their arms to athena as theano , her face radiant , lifting the robe on high , spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess ' knees and prayed to the daughter of mighty father zeus : queen athena — shield of our city — glory of goddesses !
1	whomever i want i will make my cherished wife — at home
1	superb equipment — bending it back hard the archer strung his bow
1	no , my mind won ’ t change , won ’ t budge an inch
1	all at once , in the midst of her last words , her women see her doubled over the sword , the blood foaming over the blade , her hands splattered red
1	have no doubt , what you see is real
1	achilles rose up tall and challenged every achaean : now men come forward — compete to win this prize !
1	see that honor attend these good daughters of zeus , honor that sways the minds of others , even heroes
1	commands given , he called the gods to witness
1	first he covered his broad back with leopard skin , a fine spotted hide , then lifting a round helmet of good sturdy bronze , he fitted it to his head , he took a spear in his grip and off he strode to rouse his brother , king of all the argives , the armies that prized him in his power like a god
1	let them set out the number , the class of ship they need
1	now shatter the spear of diomedes !
1	so hector drew back to his thronging comrades , terrified to hear the voice of god
1	through the worst the world can offer
1	seize the car where the handsome armor lay and pull it out by the pole or prize it up , bodily , haul it off — or tear the life from still more thracian troops ?
1	but he blocked them all from hacking passage through to the fast trim ships as ajax all alone , battling on mid-field between achaean and trojan lines , would stand and fight
1	no one could match me there , none among the epeans , not even our own pylians , or aetolia 's hardy men
1	tight as the closing gap between the wheel and horse when he hauls his master 's car top speed across the flats , the very tip of his tail brushing the running-rim and the wheel spins closer , hardly a gap between as he sweeps the open plain — that much , no more , menelaus trailed antilochus , dauntless driver
1	she found her beloved son lying facedown , embracing patroclus ' body , sobbing , wailing , and round him crowded troops of mourning comrades
1	i will never leave you , i will set you safe at your father ’ s door
1	once in the trojan council he ordered menelaus , there on an embassy joined by king odysseus , murdered right on the spot — no safe-conduct back to the land of argos
1	then achilles nodded to priam , leading the king on with brusque advice : sleep outside , old friend , in case some achaean captain comes to visit
1	but now as enemy fighters harry messapus even more , he flings himself in the stream and , flushed with triumph , pries from the turf his spear and baby girl as one , his gift to you , diana , goddess of the crossroads
1	bright as that star amid the stars in the night sky , star of the evening , brightest star that rides the heavens , so fire flared from the sharp point of the spear achilles brandished high in his right hand , bent on hector 's death , scanning his splendid body — where to pierce it best ?
1	the first to make them out was the cretan captain
1	then , as a peace offering , let him present you a lavish feast in his tents so you wo not lack your just deserts at last
1	you have covered it all fairly , point by point
1	but if i leave my comrades panicked before his charge , this prince achilles — slip away from the wall on foot and race the other way , out to ilium 's plain and reach the spurs of ida , hide in the underbrush and then , in the dying light
1	here , in victory , i lay down my gloves , my skill
1	at once , i tell you , a stranger fear runs through the harrowed crowd
1	even so , we pity these argive spearmen living out their grim fates , dying in blood
1	aeneas in command , the handsomest of them all , advancing as her companion joins his troop with hers
1	rhoetus vomits his red lifeblood , spewing out gore and wine mixed with the man ’ s last gasp
1	you are fond of him , are you ?
1	up to the huge gate-tower of troy she 's gone because she heard our men are so hard-pressed , the achaean fighters coming on in so much force
1	past these they raced , one escaping , one in pursuit and the one who fled was great but the one pursuing greater , even greater — their pace mounting in speed since both men strove , not for a sacrificial beast or oxhide trophy , prizes runners fight for , no , they raced for the life of hector breaker of horses
1	they will all be hurled back to the black ships
1	striking a stand in the dueling-ground just cleared they brandished spears at each other , tense with fury
1	the king will hand you gifts to match his insults if only you will relent and end your anger
1	the soldier who gets in first and cuts a rival 's flesh , who pierces armor to draw blood and reach his entrails — i will give that man this broadsword , silver-studded , handsome thracian work i stripped from asteropaeus
1	now rumor is in her glory , filling africa ’ s ears with tale on tale of intrigue , bruiting her song of facts and falsehoods mingled
1	a long while they said nothing , spirits dashed
1	shake them out of your teeming heart , sunder their pact of peace , sow crops of murderous war !
1	and over the massing lines of men and massing chariots , high in the air aeneas vaulted , hurled by the god 's hand till he came to ground at the battle 's churning flank where cauconian units braced themselves for action
1	what people hold it ?
1	floating adrift toward the cyclops ’ coast
1	long as he kept his royal status , holding forth in the councils of the kings , i had some standing too , some pride of place
1	the latins are our enemies twice over—this is the second pact they ’ ve shattered !
1	euryalus countered : you ’ re spinning empty arguments , they won ’ t work
1	whoever misses the bird but still hits the cord — he 's the loser , true , but he takes the single heads
1	nor has it been my way , soldiering on beside you , following out the fate of great-hearted aeneas , right to the bitter end
1	and i took my stand among them , comrade-in-arms the day the amazons struck , a match for men in war
1	we are right behind you , fighting the trojans , fighting this prince hector
1	i tell you i never cringe at war and thundering horses !
1	why have they come ?
1	his beauty fine as a craftsman ’ s hand can add to ivory , or aglow as silver or parian marble ringed in glinting gold
1	no , at his royal ease , and powerful as he is , let him rest content with his third of the world
1	coming face-to-face with atrides agamemnon , he relieved him of his fathers ' royal scepter — its power can never die — and grasping it tightly off he strode to the ships of argives armed in bronze
1	all right then , citizens !
1	after the long cortege of pallas ’ friends had moved on well ahead , aeneas drew to a halt , groaned from his depths and spoke these last words : the same dark fate of battle commands me back to other tears
1	you are planting the seeds of endless trouble for us all !
1	her son who makes the starry world go round replied : mother , what are you asking fate to grant ?
1	not even semele , not even alcmena queen of thebes who bore me a son , that lionheart , that heracles , and semele bore dionysus , ecstasy , joy to mankind — not when i loved demeter , queen of the lustrous braids — not when i bedded leto ripe for glory — not even you !
1	put an end to your labors
1	lifting one from the lot , hecuba brought it out for great athena 's gift , the largest , loveliest , richly worked , and like a star it glistened , deep beneath the others
1	he stopped — overwhelmed by the torrid blast of the master craftsman god of fire — and xanthus cried to hera , pouring out his heart in a flood of supplication , oh hera — why ?
1	they thought you the bravest champion we could field , and just because of the handsome luster on your limbs , but you have no pith , no fighting strength inside you
1	zeus commands you to arm your long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now you can take the broad streets of troy !
1	famous names in the future , nameless places now
1	who are his parents ?
1	so that gray-eyed girl of mine may learn what it means to fight against her father
1	i only wanted to plunge myself in grief
1	but i would die of shame to face the men of troy and the trojan women trailing their long robes if i would shrink from battle now , a coward
1	but the big spear 's point still stuck in the eye socket — hoisting the head high like a poppy-head on the shaft he flourished it in the eyes of all the trojans now , yelling out his boast : go tell them from me , you trojans , tell the loving father and mother of lofty ilioneus to start the dirges in the halls !
1	neither his strength nor splendid build can save him , not now , i tell you — nor all that glorious armor : now , somewhere under our floods that gear will sink , immersed deep in slime , and i , i will roil his body round in sand and gravel , tons of spills of silt
1	no , it ’ s turnus alone he ’ s tracking , eyes alert through the murky haze of battle , turnus alone aeneas demands to fight
1	up with you — now , late as it is , if you want to pull our argives , our hard-hit armies , clear of the trojan onslaught
1	already i see them looming up beside you — death and the strong force of fate , to bring you down at the hands of aeacus ' great royal son
1	illustrious paris — crush him under my hand !
1	they went for each other fast , close range — phegeus hurled first , his spear 's shadow flew and over tydides ' left shoulder the tip passed and never touched his body
1	but abruptly zeus was set on infuriating hera , courting her fire with cunning , mocking taunts : so , those two goddesses there are menelaus ' best defense , hera of argos , boeotian athena , guard of armies
1	a terrific din of bronze rang from the captain 's chest , striding toward attack
1	quick to his cry poseidon and pallas moved in close , stood at his shoulder now and taking human form , grasped him hand-to-hand , spoke bracing words , poseidon who shakes the mainland first to say , courage , achilles !
1	what ’ s more , if a prophet has second sight , if helenus earns your trust and apollo fills his soul with truth , one prophecy , one above all , son of the goddess , i will make to you , over and over repeat this warning word
1	and once they reached the perfect spot for attack , a watering place where all the herds collected , there they crouched , wrapped in glowing bronze
1	chiefs of the argives armed in bronze , the favorite son of peteos dear to immortals needs you at his strongpoint — hurry , come , just for a moment , meet the crisis there
1	he went on the run at the fighting prophet helenus , all menace , madly shaking his whetted javelin just as helenus seized his bow by the handgrip
1	race through wounds to a swift and noble death ?
1	as smoke goes towering up the sky from out a town cut off on a distant island under siege
1	look there , he heads for niphaeus ’ car and his four horses raising their chests against him , but as they see him ramping on in his loping strides and hear him groan in fury , round they wheel in terror , rearing backward , spilling their driver out the chariot , whirling it down to shore
1	but in twelve days the father returns to olympus
1	now , when the famous crippled smith had finished off that grand array of armor , lifting it in his arms he laid it all at the feet of achilles ' mother thetis — and down she flashed like a hawk from snowy mount olympus bearing the brilliant gear , the god of fire 's gift
1	aeneas is the first to attack the beleaguered farmers and— sign of the battle ’ s outcome—brings the latins down , killing mighty theron who dared to attack aeneas
1	but about the dead , i would never grudge their burning
1	meanwhile anchises gave the command to spread sail , no time to waste , we ’ d lose the good fair winds , and apollo ’ s seer addressed him with deep respect : anchises , worthy to wed the proudest , venus herself , how the gods do love you
1	killing so many brave achaeans for no good reason , not a shred of decency , just to wound my heart !
1	over against the ships he dropped to a knee , let fly a shaft and a terrifying clash rang out from the great silver bow
1	but just then a troop of cavalry sent on ahead from the latin city— the rest of the army waits , poised on the plain— comes riding in with messages for king turnus
1	but you , if your heart compels you , climb this ridge and i soon will set your steps on an easy path
1	quick with another arrow , the archer let fly from his bowstring straight for hector , his spirit straining to hit him — shot and missed again as apollo skewed his shaft — but he leveled archeptolemus , hector 's daring driver charging headlong , caught him square in the chest beside the nipple and off his car he pitched as his horses balked , rearing , pawing the air
1	hector knew full well the tide of battle had turned but still stood firm , defending die-hard comrades
1	i will not venture into achilles ' presence : it would offend us all for a mortal man to host an immortal face-to-face
1	hector who burned so many oxen in my honor , rich cuts , now on the rugged crests of ida , now on ilium 's heights
1	what is fortune saving you for , what death-blow ?
1	this fine beast , straying from home , chanced to be floating down a stream , cooling off on a grassy bank when the frenzied hounds of the hunter iulus started it—iulus himself , fired with a love of glory , aimed a shaft from his tensed bow and allecto steadied his trembling hand and the arrow shot with a whirring rush and pierced through womb and loins
1	the whole lot — we drove them all into pylos then , that very night , corraling them all inside the walls of neleus
1	atreus ' son agamemnon , for all his far-flung kingdoms — the man disgraces me , seizes and keeps my prize , he tears her away himself !
1	then in my panic something strange , some enemy power robbed me of my senses
1	magnificent racing stallions , gifts of the gods to peleus , shining immortal gifts , straining breakneck on as patroclus ' high courage urged him against prince hector , keen for the kill but hector 's veering horses swept him clear
1	but helenus son of priam , best of the seers who scan the flight of birds , came striding up to aeneas and hector , calling out , my captains !
1	search for your ancient mother
1	he gave me worthy ransom and you shall have your share from me , as always , your fitting , lordly share
1	he hears hoofbeats , hears a commotion , orders , hot pursuit
1	hera placed in her hand a burnished golden cup and said some words of comfort , and taking a few quick sips , thetis gave it back
1	but his noble mother , settling down at his side , stroked achilles gently , whispering his name : my child — how long will you eat your heart out here in tears and torment ?
1	artemis taught the man herself to track and kill wild beasts , whatever breeds in the mountain woods , but the huntress showering arrows could not save him now nor the archer 's long shots , his forte in days gone by
1	desert — if your spirit drives you to sail home , then sail away , my king !
1	there lies sarpedon , lord of lycia 's shieldsmen , who defended his realm with just decrees and power — ares has cut him down with patroclus ' brazen spear
1	then , riddled with wound on wound , he threw himself on his lifeless friend and there in the still of death found peace at last
1	no better tactics now than to fight them hand-to-hand with all our fury
1	these are the realms that monstrous cerberus rocks with howls braying out of his three throats , his enormous bulk squatting low in the cave that faced them there
1	i will find my own death , sword in hand : my enemies keen for spoils will be so kind
1	he had kept a watch for the trojans , posted atop old aesyetes ' tomb and poised to sprint for home at the first sign of argives charging from the ships
1	reaching the front , they climbed down from the chariot , onto the earth that feeds us all , and into the space between achaean and trojan lines they marched
1	brooding , never forgetting the gods would bring no son of mine to birth , not from my own loins
1	and strife and havoc plunged in the fight , and violent death — now seizing a man alive with fresh wounds , now one unhurt , now hauling a dead man through the slaughter by the heels , the cloak on her back stained red with human blood
1	how unless one last time , one final time apollo had swept in close beside him , driving strength in his legs and knees to race the wind ?
1	with that greeting she leads aeneas into the royal halls , announcing offerings in the gods ’ high temples as she goes
1	you are the one hit hardest by the fighting , hector , you more than all — and all for me , whore that i am , and this blind mad paris
1	her husband noticed , and filled with pity now , hector stroked her gently , trying to reassure her , repeating her name : andromache , dear one , why so desperate ?
1	hephaestus gave it to cronus ' son , father zeus , and zeus gave it to hermes , the giant-killing guide and hermes gave it to pelops , that fine charioteer , pelops gave it to atreus , marshal of fighting men , who died and passed it on to thyestes rich in flocks and he in turn bestowed it on agamemnon , to bear on high as he ruled his many islands and lorded mainland argos
1	and the brilliant runner achilles saw him coming , filled with pity and spoke out winging words : why in tears , patroclus ?
1	your own fame goes spreading far as the light of dawn
1	and that 's why your spirit brought you back to troy , to climb the heights and stretch your arms to zeus
1	not even then will your noble mother lay you on your deathbed , mourn the son she bore
1	he collapsed , and his servants bore him quickly into the house
1	now you ’ ll pay me in full with your hot blood for both my men !
1	ca not you grasp what the white-armed goddess tells us ?
1	noble nestor the king of pylos ' sandy harbor spoke and urged them on with all good will : friends , lords of the argives , o my captains !
1	but all the same he hurled thymbraeus down to ground from his car — diomedes speared his left breast as odysseus killed the warlord 's aide-in-arms molion tall as a god and left them there for dead , their fighting finished
1	inspired with nestor 's voice and sent by zeus , the dream cried out , still asleep , agamemnon ?
1	what new twist of fortune can save me now ?
1	driven by all this , dido plans her escape , collects her followers fired by savage hate of the tyrant or bitter fear
1	but now take up in your hands my storm-cloud shield , its dark tassels flying , shake it over the argives , stampede their heroes in panic , archer of the sky
1	and the same women , the same men who once believed the face of the sea , its mighty god , too cruel to bear , now long to embark and brave the pains of exile to the end
1	— and the gods drove home that curse , mighty zeus of the underworld and grim persephone
1	then aeneas carried out twin robes , stiff with purple and gold braid , that dido of sidon made with her own hands once , just for aeneas , loving every stitch of the work and weaving into the weft a glinting mesh of gold
1	you who pity our hardships—wherever the ground lies where you come surging forth in all your glory—always with offerings , always with gifts i ’ ll do you honor , you great horned king of the rivers of the west
1	grief for his dead companion seized patroclus now , he tore through frontline fighters swift as a hawk diving to scatter crows and fear-struck starlings — straight at the lycians , patroclus o my rider , straight at the pressing trojan ranks you swooped , enraged at your comrade 's death !
1	only the first guards at the gates put up some show of resistance , fighting blindly on
1	ruthless mars was drawing the battle out , dead even now , equaling out the grief , the mutual slaughter
1	so there he stood , taking it all , beating away the ruthless day of death
1	and hector hurled at idomeneus now aboard a chariot — missed by a hair but he caught meriones ' aide and driver coeranus , one who would come with his lord from rock-built lyctus
1	fear would have gripped the staunchest man and made his knees give way
1	but aphrodite here with her everlasting laughter always stands by paris and drives the deadly spirits from her man
1	we attacked that tower with iron crowbars , just where the upper-story planks showed loosening joints—we rocked it , wrenched it free of its deep moorings and all at once we heaved it toppling down with a crash , trailing its wake of ruin to grind the massed greeks assaulting left and right
1	when pallas judged him just in range of his spear he moved up first—if only fortune would speed his daring , pitting himself against unequal odds , and he cries out to the arching heavens : hercules , by my father ’ s board , the welcome you met as a stranger , i beg you , stand by the great task i ’ m tackling now
1	next diomedes killed two sons of dardan priam careening on in a single car , echemmon and chromius
1	he ran to straddle and hide him with his shield as a brace of comrades shouldered up the fighter : echius ' son mecisteus helping good alastor bore him back to the hollow warships , groaning hard
1	then off she went herself to summon helen and found her there on the steep , jutting tower with a troop of trojan women clustered round her
1	so athena commanded and he obeyed , rejoicing at heart — achilles stopped , leaning against his ashen spearshaft barbed in bronze
1	now you will pay at a stroke for all my comrades ' grief , all you killed in the fury of your spear !
1	obey the commands of others , your superiors — you , you deserter , rank coward , you count for nothing , neither in war nor council
1	so off he went to lycia , safe in the escort of the gods , and once he reached the broad highlands cut by the rushing xanthus , the king of lycia gave him a royal welcome
1	and now , too , the dank night is sweeping down from the sky and the setting stars incline our heads to sleep
1	both warriors planted there before the towering gates rose like oaks that rear their crests on a mountain ridge , standing up to the gales and driving rains , day in , day out , their giant roots branching , gripping deep in the earth : so these two , trusting all to their arms , their power , stood up to asius ' headlong charge and never shrank
1	cronus ' son has trapped me in madness , blinding ruin — zeus is a harsh , cruel god
1	the old soldier spurring his men with skills from a lifetime spent campaigning , battles long ago
1	well , do as you please
1	if only i would foreseen all this , i and my cunning — that day eurystheus sent him down to death , to the lord who guards the gates , to drag up from the dark world the hound of grisly death — he would never have fled the steep cascading styx
1	sweet sleep overwhelmed him
1	the prophet spurs them at once to risk escape by sea : you can not root out troy with your greek spears unless you seek new omens in greece and bring the god back here— the image they ’ d borne across the sea in their curved ships
1	and zeus the son of cronus with cronus ' twisting ways , filling with pity now to see the two great fighters , said to hera , his sister and his wife , my cruel fate
1	with that he turned and left , filled with shame to grapple his own father 's brother hand-to-hand
1	shaking his spear , he hurled and its long shadow flew and the shaft hit paris ' round shield , hit full center — straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked , tearing the war-shirt , close by paris ' flank it jabbed but the trojan swerved aside and dodged black death
1	already , there , the grand house of deiphobus stormed by fire , crashing in ruins— already his neighbor ucalegon up in flames— the sigean straits shimmering back the blaze , the shouting of fighters soars , the clashing blare of trumpets
1	into the crowds he goes and as the bier is lowered , throws himself on pallas , clinging for dear life , sobbing , groaning , his sorrow all but choking his voice that thrusts a passage through at last : a far cry from the pledge you made your father , pallas , that you would do nothing rash the day you trusted yourself to the savage god of war !
1	but before they got the chance a great work of the war-god flashed before their eyes !
1	later i will bleed to death inside your walls
1	ready — whips raised high — at the signal all together lashed their horses ' backs and shouted , urging them on — they broke in a burst of speed , in no time swept the plain , leaving the ships behind and lifting under their chests the dust clung to the teams like clouds or swirling gales as their manes went streaming back in the gusty tearing wind
1	so follow my advice , hard as it may seem
1	as she saw me coming , flanked by trojan troops , she lost control , afraid of a wonder so extreme
1	they all sprang to their feet at sight of hera , lifting cups to greet her , crowding round the queen
1	and back he shrank to his cohorts , dodging death but hounding him as he went meriones speared him between the genitals and the navel — hideous wound , the worst the god of battles deals to wretched men
1	still some concern for troy 's and achaea 's armies ?
1	for my own death , i will meet it freely — whenever zeus and the other deathless gods would like to bring it on !
1	so he will say and the fresh grief will swell your heart once more , widowed , robbed of the one man strong enough to fight off your day of slavery
1	for a moment i ’ ll take on your work myself
1	he would shown his son the ropes , the last word in the master horseman 's skills
1	but there stood hector , shackled fast by his deadly fate , holding his ground , exposed in front of troy and the scaean gates
1	hector shouted out to his men in a piercing voice , gallant-hearted trojans and far-famed allies !
1	such bargaining in battle , turnus already cut it short when he cut pallas down !
1	you should be begging the men who lead your allies ' famous ranks to stand and fight for all they are worth — you will ward off all the blame they hurl against you
1	you are not so young yourself , and the man who attends you here is far too old to drive off an attacker spoiling for a fight
1	and then , if we can journey home to achaean argos , pride of the breasting earth , he will be my son-by-marriage !
1	even if he can swallow down his wrath today , still he will nurse the burning in his chest until , sooner or later , he sends it bursting forth
1	that ignites them , stiffens their spines and closing ranks they halt
1	the same agony , same sword , the one same hour had borne us off together
1	fighting words — that began to stir the rage inside aeneas ' chest and out for blood he charged idomeneus now
1	so now , whoever can find a better plan , let him speak up , young soldier or old
1	jove denies you the fields of dicte : crete
1	if agamemnon were not holding out such gifts , with talk of more to come , that son of atreus , if the warlord kept on blustering in his anger , why , i would be the last to tell you , 'cast your rage to the winds !
1	potitius first , the founder of the rites , the pinarian house too , that guards the worship of hercules
1	reaching the place where they would killed hector 's spy , odysseus dear to zeus reined in the headlong team and leaping down to the ground tydides heaved the bloody spoils into his comrade 's arms
1	next comes atys , soon the source of the latin atians , little atys , a boy the boy prince iulus loved
1	you ’ d think no other battles could match its fury , nowhere else in the city were people dying so
1	these are not the shores apollo of delos urged
1	how i fear for our comrades , fear the worst !
1	and how you used to boast , year in , year out , that you were the better man than fighting menelaus in power , arm and spear !
1	lords of the argives , all my captains !
1	for three whole days we rush , the waves driving us wildly on , the sun blotted out , for as many nights we ’ re robbed of stars to steer by
1	down from ida 's slopes he dove to the bloody field and lifting prince sarpedon clear of the weapons , bore him far from the fighting , off and away , and bathed him well in a river 's running tides and anointed him with deathless oils
1	the great telamonian ajax answered firmly , all true , straight to the point , lord menelaus
1	what painful news — would to god it had never happened !
1	summoning them together there atrides set forth his cunning , foolproof plan : hear me , friends — a dream sent by the gods has come to me in sleep
1	hail forever and farewell !
1	what you see is a punic kingdom , people of tyre and agenor ’ s town , but the border ’ s held by libyans hard to break in war
1	she quickly reached the sturdy house of hector , man-killing hector , and found her women gathered there inside and stirred them all to a high pitch of mourning
1	he called at once to his friend-in-arms patroclus , shouting down from the decks
1	suddenly seizing ruin by her glossy oiled braids — he was furious , raging — now he swore his inviolate oath that never again would she return to olympus ' starry skies , that maddening goddess , ruin , ruin who blinds us all
1	do not just stand there , useless with your weapons
1	you ’ ll pay , you shameless , ruthless— and i will hear of it , yes , the report will reach me even among the deepest shades of death !
1	but round my own black ship and camp this hector blazing for battle will be stopped , i trust — stopped dead in his tracks !
1	no , he waited achilles , coming on , gigantic in power
1	here the priest , when he brings the sacred gifts and looks for sleep beneath the silent night— stretched out on the hides of slaughtered sheep— will see whole hosts of phantoms , miracles on the wing , hear the voices swarm , engage with the gods in words and speak with acheron in avernus ’ deepest pools
1	never again will you see him among the argives
1	you , you insolent brazen bitch — you really dare to shake that monstrous spear in father 's face ?
1	they both go down to death , the fighter who shirks , the one who works to exhaustion
1	they cringe and cower like hounds circling a lion
1	orsilochus fearing to face the horseman remulus , whirls a lance at his horse instead , planting the point below its ear and furious , wild with the wound , it can not bear the agony , rearing back , chest high , its hoofs thrashing the air as remulus , thrown free , rolls around in the dust
1	you argives , you degraded — splendid in battle dress , pure sham !
1	the god of war is impartial : he hands out death to the man who hands out death
1	the goddesses themselves sat down on golden settles , mixing with the immortals , athena and hera 's hearts within them dashed
1	they burst into the bedroom , ulysses , that rouser of outrage right beside them , aeolus ’ crafty heir
1	the italian troops march forth , pouring out of the packed gates in tight , massed ranks and fronting them , the entire trojan and tuscan force comes rushing up , decked out in a range of arms , no less equipped with iron than if the brutal war-god called them forth to battle
1	for us and our children down the years an irresistible sorrow
1	and breaking out of their ranks deiphobus strode , the son of priam fired for feats of arms , there , thrusting his balanced round buckler before him , step by springy step on the balls of his feet , pressing forward under his shield
1	and so they fought and the iron din went rising up to the bronze sky through the barren breathless air
1	and the father heard and thundered on the left from a cloudless sky—the instant the lethal bow sings out and the taut shaft flies through remulus ’ head with a vicious hiss and rends his empty temples with its steel
1	ca not you see how they are clawing over dolops ' armor ?
1	i sent no fleet to troy , i never uprooted the ashes of his father , anchises , never stirred his shade
1	at that , his comrades cleared off from the field and as they withdrew , young pallas , struck dumb by that arrogant command , runs his eyes over turnus ’ enormous frame , scanning every feature from where he stood and glancing grimly , pallas volleys back these words to counter the words his high and mighty enemy used : now ’ s my time to win some glory , either for stripping off a wealth of spoils or dying a noble death— my father can stand up under either fate
1	why , if only half of us went to war , each soldier could hardly find a foe
1	but a man 's life breath can not come back again — no raiders in force , no trading brings it back , once it slips through a man 's clenched teeth
1	where would they lead ?
1	but once the best of the trojan captains fell , and many achaeans died as well while some survived , and priam 's high walls were stormed in the tenth year and the argives set sail for the native land they loved — then , at last , poseidon and lord apollo launched their plan to smash the rampart , flinging into it all the rivers ' fury
1	come , why don ’ t we labor now to live in peace ?
1	now captain aeneas , now tarchon erected pyres along the sweeping shore
1	even father himself , he ’ s filling the greek hearts with courage , stamina—jove in person spurring the gods to fight the trojan armies !
1	there diomedes aimed and stabbed , he gouged him down his glistening flesh and wrenched the spear back out and the brazen god of war let loose a shriek , roaring , thundering loud as nine , ten thousand combat soldiers shriek with ares ' fury when massive armies clash
1	for not even i will voyage home again
1	and dolon son of the herald blurted out , yes , yes , i will tell you everything , down to the last detail !
1	so in a blaze of fury he pummels dares headlong over the whole wide ring , lefts and rights , doubling blows , no lull , no letup , thick and fast as the hailstones pelting down from a stormcloud , rattling roofs , so dense the champion ’ s blows , both fists pounding over and over , battering dares reeling round— enough
1	looming over the cavern ’ s ridge a spur reared up , all jagged flint , its steep sides sheering away , a beetling , towering sight , a favorite haunt of nestling vultures
1	and others bear the spear and helmet of pallas
1	nothing could shake him now
1	some other god — who knows ?
1	sending such a traveler here to meet me — what a lucky omen !
1	and hector— three times achilles has hauled him round the walls of troy and now he ’ s selling his lifeless body off for gold
1	give up the fight ?
1	when pallas saw his arcadians , untrained to attack on foot and turning tail before the latins ’ pursuit— the lay of the rock-choked land convinced them all to desert their horses—so , seizing on one last way to stem disaster , now with prayers , now stinging taunts , he fires up their war-lust : where are you flying , friends ?
1	let there be one commander , one master only , endowed by the son of crooked-minded cronus with kingly scepter and royal rights of custom : whatever one man needs to lead his people well
1	he feared that , overwhelmed by the sight of hector , wild with grief , priam might let his anger flare and achilles might fly into fresh rage himself , cut the old man down and break the laws of zeus
1	meges saw him drop , he lunged at polydamas , fast , but he ducked and veered away and meges missed him — apollo was not about to let him fall at the front , not panthous ' son
1	we battle on in words , as always , mere words , and what 's the cure ?
1	and zeus spotted her now , zeus who gathers the breasting clouds
1	a flash , a sudden hurl and atrides speared a champion out in front — it was prince aeneas ' comrade-in-arms deicoon , pergasus ' son the trojans prized like priam 's sons , quick as he always was to join the forward ranks
1	so i plan to forestall her with ruses of my own and besiege the queen with flames , and no goddess will change her mood—she ’ s mine , my ally-in-arms in my great love for aeneas
1	when two work side-by-side , one or the other spots the opening first if a kill 's at hand
1	yes , soon they will kill you off , all the achaean forces massed for assault , and then , bereft of you , better for me to sink beneath the earth
1	a corpse without a name
1	all the lords who command the ships of battle , each and every one will give him a black ewe suckling a young lamb — no prize of honor like it
1	but ceaseless war 's upon us !
1	but the same anxiety keeps on churning in his heart as he scans the endless woods and prays by chance : if only that golden bough would gleam before us now on a tree in this dark grove !
1	and so , deep in peace , the father slept on gargaron peak , conquered by sleep and strong assaults of love , his wife locked in his arms
1	just as horrible , huge as polyphemus here in his rocky cavern , penning his woolly sheep , milking their udders dry , there are a hundred more accursed cyclops , everywhere , crowding the deep inlets , lumbering over the ridged hills
1	better for him by far
1	how could i leave aeneas prey to the lying winds ?
1	and now , sealing his pledge by the river styx , his brother ’ s stream , by the banks that churn with pitch-black rapids , whirlpools swirling dark , he nodded his assent and his nod made all of mount olympus quake
1	i will take him on with a will
1	the son of atreus , that skilled breaker of horses ?
1	so our two lines are branches sprung from the same blood
1	and on and on they row , wearying night and day as they round the long , winding bends , floating under the mottled shade of many trees and cleave the quiet stream reflecting leafy woods
1	the shore ’ s deserted now , the water ’ s hidden under the fleet—they bend to it , churn the spray and sweep the clear blue sea
1	come now , let us move off and settle down together far from the trampled field , take a lookout post and leave the war to mortals
1	what good is all our strife ?
1	he rode them off the ships , he quenched the leaping fire , leaving protesilaus ' hulk half-burnt but upright still and the trojans scattered back with high , shrill cries
1	then schedius and epistrophus led the men of phocis — two sons of iphitus , that great heart , naubolus ' son — the men who held cyparissus and pytho 's high crags , the hallowed earth of crisa , daulis and panopeus , men who dwelled round anemoria , round hyampolis , men who lived along the cephisus ' glinting waters , men who held lilaea close to the river 's wellsprings
1	and the first one she roused was atreus ' son powerful menelaus — he stood right at hand — she took the build and tireless voice of phoenix : yours is the shame , atrides
1	trading words , as dawn in her rose-red chariot crossed in mid-career , high noon in the arching sky , and they might have spent what time they had with tales if the sibyl next to aeneas had not warned him tersely : night comes on , aeneas
1	then one , romulus , reveling in the tawny pelt of a wolf that nursed him , will inherit the line and build the walls of mars and after his own name , call his people romans
1	look — one of the gods comes up beside me , tells me zeus the supreme commander still impels us all in battle
1	ilium , gone—our awesome trojan glory
1	out of the front he sprang , glaring left and right and hurled his spear — a glinting brazen streak — and the trojans scattered , cringing before his shaft
1	so he launched athena already poised for action — down the goddess swept from olympus ' craggy peaks
1	never again will you embrace him striding home
1	lavinia is your bride
1	but all the rest i possess beside my fast black ship — not one bit of it can you seize against my will , atrides
1	copreus , yes , that worthless father who sired a better son , better at every skill , primed for speed and war and his wits outstripped the best in all mycenae , but all of it went now to build prince hector 's glory
1	she breaks off in the midst of outbursts , desperate , flinging herself from the light of day , sweeping out of his sight , leaving him numb with doubt , with much to fear and much he means to say
1	then on he rushed at the sons of bias — laogonus , dardanus — hurled them off their chariot , slammed them both to ground , one with a spear-thrust , one chopped down with a blade
1	apollo heard and willed that part of the prayer would win the day but part he scattered abroad on the ruffling winds
1	my destiny , harrying me with trials hard as yours , led me as well , at last , to anchor in this land
1	if only the earth gaped deep enough to take me down , to plunge this goddess into the depths of hell !
1	the herald obeyed at once
1	come now , just wait till these long-haired achaeans sail back in their ships to the fatherland they love , then batter their wall , sweep it into the salt breakers and pile over the endless beach your drifts of sand again , level it to your heart 's content — the argives ' mighty wall
1	here , you ’ ll have a gift from old anchises himself
1	i am off to engage the man , though his fists are fire , though his fists are fire and his fury burnished iron !
1	and the fourth to yoke his full-maned team was antilochus , the splendid son of nestor the old high-hearted king , lord neleus ' offspring
1	all this binds me to you , and fate drives me here , and glad i am to follow
1	and home idaeus came , delivered his message standing in their midst and they fell to making hurried preparations , dividing the labors quickly — two detachments , one to gather the bodies , one the timber
1	with this potion , aged iapyx laved the wound , quite unaware , and suddenly all the pain dissolved from aeneas ’ body , all the blood that pooled in his wound stanched , and the shaft , with no force required , slipped out in the healer ’ s hand and the old strength came back , fresh as it was at first
1	again the trojan troops and teams overtook the body with hector son of priam storming fierce as fire
1	where can we turn for help from all our toil ?
1	you would think him a sullen fellow or just plain fool
1	what i urge is this : draw back to the city now
1	should he draw the long sharp sword slung at his hip , thrust through the ranks and kill agamemnon now ?
1	— right in the bull's-hide boss but the spear did not ram through , far from it , the long shaft snapped at the spearhead 's socket — the trojan had thrust his shield at arm 's length , shrinking before the expert marksman 's lance
1	but old phoenix passes the night in camp as achilles bids him , so he can voyage home , home in the ships with him to the fatherland they love
1	the rite performed , aeneas hurries to carry out the sibyl ’ s orders
1	home he went , i would say , but not on his own two feet , and brought no cheer to his loyal , loving wife and devoted parents
1	the fates have forbidden helenus to know the rest
1	with a firm resolve and willing hearts we ’ ve reached your city , driven out of our own kingdom , once the grandest realm the wheeling sun could see from olympus ’ heights
1	but the troopers fan out left and right , blocking the well-known paths , the sentries ringing all ways out
1	the oars shatter , prow twists round , taking the breakers broadside on and over aeneas ’ decks a mountain of water towers , massive , steep
1	still alive , still breathing the breath of life ?
1	the seeds of life— fiery is their force , divine their birth , but they are weighed down by the bodies ’ ills or dulled by earthly limbs and flesh that ’ s born for death
1	later , at leisure , strip the corpses up and down the plain !
1	atlas : his pine-covered crown is forever girded round with black clouds , battered by wind and rain ; driving blizzards cloak his shoulders with snow , torrents course down from the old titan ’ s chin and shaggy beard that bristles stiff with ice
1	he is deaf to all appeals
1	lost as he is , she ’ s lost as well , she hears him , sees him or she holds ascanius back and dandles him on her lap , bewitched by the boy ’ s resemblance to his father , trying to cheat the love she dare not tell
1	you tell me to put my trust in that , that monster ?
1	the old king starts in : greatest chief of the trojans—for while you are alive i ’ ll never consider troy and its kingdom conquered— our power to reinforce you in war is slight , though i know our name is great
1	antilochus killed his charioteer and steady henchman mydon , atymnius ' strapping son , just wheeling his racers round as antilochus winged a rock and smashed his elbow — out of his grip the reins white with ivory flew and slipped to the ground and tangled in the dust
1	no love between our peoples , ever , no pacts of peace !
1	look , a son of zeus come here to face you down
1	there i will house your oracles , mystic revelations made to our race , and ordain your chosen priests , my gracious lady
1	i am a god too
1	what blows he 's dealt our men !
1	as soon as she would sworn and sealed her binding oath , away they launched from imbros ' walls and lemnos , swathed in a thick mist and nimbly made their way until they reached mount ida with all her springs , the mother of wild beasts , and making lectos headland , left the sea for the first time and swept over dry land as the treetops swayed and shook beneath their feet
1	let him lead off
1	see to your own chores , go tend the shrines and statues of the gods
1	but i broke free of death , i tell you , burst my shackles , yes , and hid all night in the reeds of a marshy lake , waiting for them to sail—if only they would sail !
1	the trojans have my gear
1	one prayer the father granted , the other he denied : patroclus would drive the onslaught off the ships — that much zeus granted , true , but denied him safe and sound return from battle
1	and at one glance the lust came swirling over him , making his heart race , fast as the first time — all unknown to their parents — they rolled in bed , they locked and surged in love
1	then atreus ' son menelaus , the red-haired captain born of the gods , leading under the yoke his racers , blaze , agamemnon 's mare , and his own stallion brightfoot
1	bulked against them , boeotian troops , ionian troops with their long war-shirts , locrians , phthians and men of epea famed in battle fought to stop this hector hurtling at the ships
1	nor do i think you merit any other burial rites than good aeneas grants , and the trojan heroes , tuscan chiefs as well and tuscan armies , bearing your great trophies stripped from the men your right arm killed in war
1	and brilliant achilles tested himself in all his gear , achilles spun on his heels to see if it fitted tightly , see if his shining limbs ran free within it , yes , and it felt like buoyant wings lifting the great captain
1	but quick as a flash the soldier , certain his guile had won the day , runs away himself , yanking his reins around and digging iron spurs in his racing stallion ’ s flanks
1	on these shores arcadians sprung from pallas— king evander ’ s comrades marching under his banner— picked their site and placed a city on these hills , pallanteum , named for their famous forebear , pallas
1	good aeneas grants the appeal he ’ d never shun
1	not all of them march to war with armor , shields and chariots rumbling on
1	and the father of gods himself already marks him out with his own bolts of honor
1	and spotting tydides there , field marshal agamemnon gave him a winging burst of scorn : what 's this ?
1	only our native trojans hold their posts — many as those with hearth fires back in troy — our men have no choice , shouting out to each other , 'stay awake !
1	pallas wrenches the spearhead warm from his wound—no use— his blood and his life breath follow hard on the same track out
1	my mind 's made up
1	the old man was stunned , in a swirl of terror , the hairs stood bristling all over his gnarled body — he stood there , staring dumbly
1	achates is first to strike a spark from flint , then works to keep it alive in dry leaves , cups it around with kindling , feeds it chips and briskly fans the tinder into flame
1	but the old majestic priam countered quickly , who are you , my fine friend ?
1	now , would one of you gods call thetis to my presence ?
1	sthenelus sprang from the car , hit the ground and standing beside him , pulled the tearing arrow clean on through the wound and blood came shooting out like a red lance through the supple mesh shirt
1	then kings reared up and the savage giant thybris , and since his time we italians call our river tiber
1	then we are sent to elysium ’ s broad expanse , a few of us even hold these fields of joy till the long days , a cycle of time seen through , cleanse our hard , inveterate stains and leave us clear ethereal sense , the eternal breath of fire purged and pure
1	not all of a single tribe but three in one , four clans under each , and mantua leads them all and the city draws her force from tuscan blood
1	so all troy breathes free , relieved of her endless sorrow
1	far better for one of ours to reap the benefits than all the marauding argives
1	then , crowning all , juturna adds a greater power
1	go , patroclus , prince , bring out the girl and hand her to them so they can take her back
1	the lord of the earthquake yielded ground in answer : true , iris , immortal friend , how right you are — it 's a fine thing when a messenger knows what 's proper
1	and you will die with the rest
1	they would rather drop and die by our fast trim ships than rise to their defense
1	aeneas , never pausing , hails the ghost at once in an old familiar voice : mighty captain , deiphobus , sprung of the noble blood of teucer , who was bent on making you pay a price so harsh ?
1	around the pyre they planted a ring of stone revetments , piled the loose earth high in a mound above the ring and once they would heaped the barrow turned to leave
1	to my sisters ' house ?
1	as the eagle that bears jove ’ s lightning snatches up in his hooking talons a hare or snow-white swan and towers into the sky , or the wolf of mars that rips a lamb from the pens and its mother desperate to find it fills the air with bleating
1	and so he convenes a council , all the leading captains mustered at his command , inside the lofty gates
1	ah , so the deathless gods must love aeneas too
1	as fresh as i was that day the epeans buried lord amarynceus in buprasion and his sons held games to celebrate the king
1	begin , muse , when the two first broke and clashed , agamemnon lord of men and brilliant achilles
1	that roused the crowd , they leaned to look and marveled
1	and many drove their bronze blades through his body
1	must i bear the sight of latinus ’ houses razed— the last thing i needed—and not rebut the ugly slander of drances with my sword ?
1	seven summers gone since troy went down and still we ’ re swept along , measuring out each land , each sea— how many hostile rocks and stars ? —scanning an endless ocean , chasing an italy fading still as the waves roll us on
1	but what can he do ?
1	once we entered , allowed to appeal before the king , we offered our gifts , told him our names , our native land , and who had attacked us , what had drawn us to arpi
1	even of sorrow men can have their fill
1	so up now , hector — command your drivers here in all their hundreds to lash their plunging teams at the hollow ships
1	our sons-in-law will arrive from foreign shores : that is the fate in store for latium , so the prophets say , a stranger ’ s blood will raise our name to the stars
1	i am eager to do it — whatever i can do
1	but the rest will part in peace , and soon , soon
1	messapus himself was stunned with terror , his stallions reared , and the river , roaring , checked its currents , tiber summoned his outflow back from open sea
1	and menelaus found him alongside his ship 's stern , strapping his handsome gear around his shoulders
1	but finding he lacks the power to quash their blind fanatic will , and the world rolls on at a nod from brutal juno , time and again he calls the gods and empty winds to witness : crushed by fate , the father cries , we ’ re wrenched away by the tempest !
1	how can you sleep all night , a man weighed down with duties ?
1	what cowardice saps your courage ?
1	menelaus shoved adrestus back with a fist , powerful agamemnon stabbed him in the flank and back on his side the fighter went , faceup
1	i suppose you got such tender loving care at home from the trojans
1	well let him bed her now — enjoy her to the hilt !
1	but just when the woodsman makes his morning meal , deep in a mountain forest , arm-weary from chopping the big heavy trunks and his heart has had enough and sudden longing for tempting food overtakes the man and makes his senses whirl — just at the height of morning the argives smashed battalions , their courage breaking through and they shouted ranks of cohorts on along the lines
1	priam found the warrior there inside
1	what of the trophies hanging from your rafters ?
1	but not even then were his men without a captain , yearn as they did for their lost leader
1	now let no fighter be turned back to the ships , not with his captain 's orders ringing in his ears — keep pressing forward , shouting each other on !
1	all night long they hurled the flames — massed on the pyre , blast on screaming blast — and all night long the swift achilles , lifting a two-handled cup , dipped wine from a golden bowl and poured it down on the ground and drenched the earth , calling out to the ghost of stricken , gaunt patroclus
1	for the runner-up he produced a massive ox with rippling folds of fat and half a bar of gold for him who came in last
1	and the same in warfare : how he razed to the roots those brilliant cities , troy and oechalia both
1	now , when they mingled with our trojans in assembly , standing side-by-side , menelaus ' shoulders mounted over his friend 's in height and spread , when both were seated odysseus looked more lordly
1	book six : hector returns to troy
1	so they prayed as ajax harnessed himself in burnished , gleaming bronze and once he had strapped his legs and chest in armor , out he marched like the giant god of battle wading into the wars of men when zeus drives them hard to clash and soldier on with heart-devouring hate
1	shall i cut and run ?
1	what terrific sheen — silver afire like sunbeams !
1	cast delay to the winds !
1	he could not escape — no retreat , no dodging the stroke , like a pillar or tree crowned with leaves , rearing , standing there stock-still as the hero idomeneus stabbed him square in the chest and split the bronze plate that cased his ribs , gear that had always kept destruction off his flesh but it cracked and rang out now , ripped by the spear
1	the troops sat down by rank , each beside his horses pawing the ground where blazoned war-gear lay
1	— when he comes home from battle bearing the bloody gear of the mortal enemy he has killed in war — a joy to his mother 's heart
1	i was the one , i admit , who spurred her on to help her embattled brother , true , and blessed whatever greater daring it took to save his life , but never to shower arrows , never tense the bow
1	the god bent his head that the armies must be saved , not die in blood
1	your comrades , you yourself must hold fast to this sacred rite , this custom
1	now as the two men drank their parching thirst away and had just begun to please themselves with talk , confiding back and forth — there stood patroclus tall at the threshold , vivid as a god
1	the trojans , soon as they saw menoetius ' gallant son , himself and his loyal driver flare in brazen gear — all their courage quaked , their columns buckled , thinking swift achilles had tossed to the winds his hard rage that held him back by the ships and chosen friendship toward the argives now
1	but not for long , i trust — they will soon break off and slink back to olympus , home to the gathered gods who wait their coming , overwhelmed by the crushing power of our fists !
1	so she complied and turned their racers back
1	tonight conserve our strength in the meeting place , and the great walls and gates and timbered doors we hung , well-planed , massive and bolted tight , will shield the city
1	marvelous — like the man to the life !
1	his own mother had breathed her beauty on her son , a gloss on his flowing hair , and the ruddy glow of youth , and radiant joy shone in his eyes
1	may the gods make all our bluster come to nothing
1	i need all your immortal force
1	quickly he overtook his brother , noble hector still lingering , slow to turn from the spot where he had just confided in his wife
1	he bent down over it , trying to wrench the iron loose and track with a spear the kill he could not catch on foot
1	with that he hurled and athena drove the shaft and it split the archer 's nose between the eyes — it cracked his glistening teeth , the tough bronze cut off his tongue at the roots , smashed his jaw and the point came ripping out beneath his chin
1	all in vain my father peleus vowed to you that there , once i had journeyed home to my own dear fatherland , i would cut this lock for you and offer splendid victims , dedicate fifty young ungelded rams to your springs , there at the spot where your grove and smoking altar stand !
1	so all the trojans and famous friends-in-arms embraced polydamas ' plan , the faultless chieftain
1	there the spear stuck
1	so the bronze flared on his chest as out he rushed but his rough-and-ready aide-in-arms meriones intercepted him just outside the tent
1	amid this din and confusion gyas darts ahead , leading the field at the start to race across the surf— next cloanthus , better oared but his pine hulk slows him down— next , at an equal gap , the dragon and centaur fight it out for third , and now the dragon has it and now the huge centaur edges her out , now they ’ re even , prow to prow , cleaving the salt sea with long keels
1	better for me alone to redeem the pact for you and let my sword decide !
1	but resolute diomedes gave him a dark glance : sit down , my friend , be quiet
1	but any soldier wild with desire to reach his home at once — just let him lay a hand on his black benched ship and right in front of the rest he will reach his death !
1	spotting him first odysseus quickly pointed him out to diomedes : look , here 's our man , here are his horses
1	he first bore minos , watch and ward of crete , then minos bore an illustrious son deucalion , yes , and deucalion fathered me to command a race of men through the length and breadth of crete , and now our ships have borne me here to your shores to be your curse , a curse to your father , curse to the men of troy !
1	but much-enduring odysseus cut him short : not too long on the praise — do not fault me either
1	but now for total war , bearing down on the other gods , disastrous , massive , their fighting-fury blasting loose from opposing camps — the powers collided !
1	and guneus out of cyphus led on two and twenty ships and in his platoons came enienes and battle-tried peraebians who pitched homes in the teeth of dodona 's bitter winters , who held the tilled acres along the lovely titaressus that runs her pure crystal currents into peneus — never mixed with peneus ' eddies glistening silt but gliding over the surface smooth as olive oil , branching , breaking away from the river styx , the dark and terrible oath-stream of the gods
1	next he fought the solymi , tribesmen bent on glory , roughest battle of men he ever entered , so he claimed
1	polypoetes was not alone , leonteus shared the helm , companion of ares , caeneus ' grandson , proud coronus ' son
1	no pity for me , her mother ?
1	i will tell you , my son , not keep you in suspense , anchises says , and unfolds all things in order , one by one
1	what god urged you , all unknowing , to our shores ?
1	i will carry you on my back
1	here the infernal fury throws an instant frenzy into the hounds , she daubs their nostrils wet with a well-known scent , and they burn to chase a stag
1	for all that you have done for me , achilles , may the immortals fill your cup with joy !
1	turnus ’ limbs went limp in the chill of death
1	why such wailing echoing in the air ?
1	leave our olympian stronghold — take a message to greathearted priam down in troy : he must go to achaea 's ships and ransom his dear son , bearing gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
1	ours is a stately mansion , deep inside lie buried bars of ridged silver and heavy weights of gold , some of it tooled , some untooled—mine alone !
1	achilles has lost all pity !
1	incensed at the king he swept a fatal plague through the army — men were dying and all because agamemnon spurned apollo 's priest
1	only a glimpse of him the fates will grant the world , not let him linger longer
1	his voice rang out in tears and the warlords mourned in answer , each remembering those he had left behind at home
1	but rhoetus , waking , witnessed it all and cowered , crouching behind an enormous mixing-bowl , but euryalus pounced as rhoetus rose—he rushed him , drove a sword in his heart , up to the hilt then wrenched it back , dripping death
1	he seized the yoke as the luckless brother , slipping off the war-car , flinging his helpless arms toward aeneas , prayed : i beg you , beg by the ones who bore a son like you , great man of troy , now spare my life , pity my prayers !
1	father latinus , they say , had found it once himself , building his first stronghold , hallowed it to phoebus and named his settlers after the laurel ’ s name , laurentes
1	but the buoyant shade parades before the front , shaking a spear in his enemy ’ s face and taunting— turnus attacks it , rifling a vibrant lance , a long cast but the phantom swerves away and turnus in turmoil , thinking aeneas had really turned tail and fled , and drinking deep of the vapid cup of hope , cries out : where are you racing , aeneas ?
1	rocky ground and he 's quick at every treachery under the sun — the man of twists and turns
1	and rising up before her , the nile immersed in mourning opens every fold of his mighty body , all his rippling robes , inviting into his deep blue lap and secret eddies all his conquered people
1	if only we could seize his body , mutilate him , shame him , tear his gear from his back and any comrade of his who tries to shield his corpse — bring that enemy down with ruthless bronze !
1	then report the news to all his comrades
1	but hector ranged the front to find his leaders , hunting deiphobus and the rugged warlord helenus , adamas , asius ' son , and asius son of hyrtacus
1	back to the ships he will go , once he 's lashed the power out of his rippling stallions , whipping them back and forth beneath our city walls
1	so ajax swung now , leaping from deck to deck on the fast trim ships , ranging with huge strides as his voice hit the skies , keeping up a terrific bellowing , calling argives on to defend the ships and shelters
1	this was priam ’ s regalia when , in the way he liked to rule , he handed down the laws to his gathered people—the scepter , the holy coronet and the robes that trojan women used to weave
1	idomeneus had left the ships on foot that morning and would have offered the trojans a fine triumph now if coeranus had not rushed to the rescue , lashed his team and come like light to the king — he saved his life that day but he quickly lost his own to man-killing hector — hector speared him under the jaw and ear , knocking teeth out , shattering roots and all and split his tongue in half
1	yet the spirit inside you never shrinks from claiming to be his equal , never — though other gods will cringe from him in terror
1	do not talk to me of pacts
1	has the love your father hoped for mastered the hardship of the journey ?
1	what ’ s this conflict flouting my command ?
1	water for their hands !
1	grieving once for her own fate her mother had raised the halcyon 's thin , painful cry , wailing that lord apollo the distant deadly archer had whisked her far from idas
1	the mesh of the huge dragnet sweeping up the world , before you are trapped , your enemies ' prey and plunder — soon they will raze your sturdy citadel to the roots !
1	i never flinch at death or bow to a single god
1	one more thing — take it to heart , i urge you — you too , you wo not live long yourself , i swear
1	then with his blade he carved wide open liger ’ s chest , his hidden cache of life
1	there are the thracians , look , just arrived , exposed on the flank , apart from all the rest and right in their midst eioneus ' son , king rhesus
1	what then , did she stop in her tracks or lose her way ?
1	here ’ s pharus , watch , hurling his hollow threats as aeneas hurls his javelin , stakes it square in the man ’ s howling mouth
1	shield me , i implore you , from their fury !
1	sons i have , and they are hardy , handsome boys , and comrades too , men aplenty — one of the lot could light out now and summon up the kings
1	and the ships pulled in from lemnos bringing wine , a big convoy sent across by euneus , jason 's son whom hypsipyle bore the seasoned lord of armies
1	peace—we all beg you , turnus—bound with the one inviolate pledge of peace !
1	now the war-team — alcimus and automedon worked to yoke them quickly
1	as long as that man kept raging at royal agamemnon the argive troops were easier game to battle down
1	it ’ s just the style for tyrian girls to sport a quiver and high-laced hunting boots in crimson
1	now acron , a greek , had just arrived from corythus ’ old frontier , an exile , leaving his marriage in the lurch
1	there you have my lineage
1	here too , latinus himself , seeking out responses , slaughtered a hundred yearling sheep in the old way and there he lay ensconced , at rest on fleecy hides when a sudden voice broke from the grove ’ s depths : never seek to marry your daughter to a latin , put no trust , my son , in a marriage ready-made
1	but the leading trojan chiefs , the chosen men of rank were holding a council now on grave affairs of state— what should they do ?
1	how keen their longing for dry land underfoot as the trojans disembark , taking hold of the earth , their last best hope , and fling their brine-wracked bodies on the sand
1	but catch menelaus ' pair — fast — do not get left behind — or blaze will shower the two of you with disgrace — blaze is a mare !
1	how can a man be first in all events ?
1	how can you hold back your combat-fury any longer ?
1	well , you must get on with your friend 's burial now — the games must go on — but i accept this gladly , my old heart rejoices
1	finally diomedes lord of the war cry broke forth : great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon — if only you would never begged the dauntless son of peleus , holding out to achilles trove on trove of gifts !
1	with a full-shoulder stroke he flogged his horses on , loosing a splitting war cry down the trojan ranks and all cried back in answer — a savage roar rising — driving teams and chariots close in line with his
1	just as he vaulted off his ship a dardan killed him , first by far of the argives slaughtered on the beaches
1	the raiders quit the camp and race for safety
1	he suddenly sprang forward , into the front ranks , the god 's voice rippling strong : again , you argives ?
1	oh , dear god , was it i who caused your death ?
1	what am i hearing , why this enormous grief that rocks the walls , this clamor echoing from the city far away ?
1	but then , chancing to make the ocean ring with his hollow shell , the madman challenged the gods to match him blast for blast and jealous triton—if we can believe the story— snatched him up and drowned the man in the surf that seethed between the rocks
1	he shut himself in its depths , shattered the chains and down the great rock dropped , suspended by steel and his father ’ s skill , to wedge between the doorposts , block the entrance fast
1	teucer charged forward , mad to strip that gear but as teucer charged , hector flung his lance — a glint of bronze — but the argive saw it coming , dodged to the side and it missed him by an inch and hit amphimachus , cteatus ' son and actor 's heir , the shaft slashed his chest as he ran toward the front and down he went , thundering , armor clanging round him
1	welcome words , and the radiant goddess charis led the way inside
1	— he may have put an end to that fatal headstrong pride that always seized my hector — never hanging back with the main force of men , always charging ahead , giving ground to no man in his fury !
1	so come , let us yield to each other now on this one point , i to you and you to me , and the other deathless powers will fall in line
1	they tell how cycnus , wrung by grief for his lover , lifting a song to soothe his broken heart for phaëthon— shadowed by leafy poplars , phaëthon ’ s sisters once— cycnus donned the downy white plumage of old age , left the earth behind and soared up to the stars on wings of song
1	and he forged on the shield a herd of longhorn cattle , working the bulls in beaten gold and tin , lowing loud and rumbling out of the farmyard dung to pasture along a rippling stream , along the swaying reeds
1	so come , follow the gods ’ commands that lead us on
1	and aeolus , you too , the laurentine fields saw you go down and your body spread across the earth
1	now they will disgrace you , a woman after all
1	but with you the blessed gods are not enraged , not through and through , agamemnon
1	iris swooping down from the clouds ?
1	so he declared and sat down
1	like devouring fire roaring down onto dry dead timber , squalls hurling it on , careening left and right and brush ripped up by the roots goes tumbling under crushed by the blasting fire rampaging on — so under atrides ' onslaught trojans dropped in flight , stampedes of massive stallions dragged their empty chariots clattering down the passageways of battle , stallions yearning to feel their masters ' hands at the reins but there they lay , sprawled across the field , craved far more by the vultures than by wives
1	and throughout the halls of zeus the gods of heaven quaked with fear
1	but this , now , is the twentieth year for me since i sailed here and forsook my own native land , yet never once did i hear from you a taunt , an insult
1	but aeneas is driven by duty now
1	to fill your own cup of pain then slink back to olympus , whipped and fuming — forced ?
1	but if i kill him and apollo grants me glory , i will strip his gear and haul it back to sacred troy and hang it high on the deadly archer 's temple walls
1	so he appealed , calling out for the god ’ s help , and not for nothing
1	once he left evander and entered the tuscan camp , he seeks king tarchon , tells him his name and stock and the help he needs and the help he brings himself
1	if i ever served you well among the deathless gods with a word or action , bring this prayer to pass : honor my son achilles !
1	—achates was first to shout the name— italy !
1	here this firebrand , rabid hector leads the charge , claiming to be the son of high and mighty zeus
1	you , sun , whose fires scan all works of the earth , and you , juno , the witness , midwife to my agonies— hecate greeted by nightly shrieks at city crossroads— and you , you avenging furies and gods of dying dido !
1	then achilles carried into the armies ' broad ring a spear trailing its long shadow , laid it down and beside it placed a battle-shield and helmet , the arms patroclus stripped from lord sarpedon
1	antilochus next — the son of nestor drove in second , beating atrides not by speed but cunning — but still menelaus kept his racers close behind
1	i am setting an ambush deep in a hollowed woody path and posting troops to block the passage through at both ends of the gorge
1	i beg you , cool your fury against achilles
1	on with it — taste the bite of each other 's brazen spears !
1	wildly , back and forth , turnus gallops along the walls—a way in ? —no way in
1	invincible mars rears up to meet us face-to-face with waves of greeks assaulting the roofs , we see them choking the gateway , under a tortoise-shell of shields , and the scaling ladders cling to the steep ramparts— just at the gates the raiders scramble up the rungs , shields on their left arms thrust out for defense , their right hands clutching the gables
1	nevertheless , king agamemnon , groaning heavily , grasped menelaus ' hand and spoke out for the men as friends around him groaned as well : dear brother — that truce i sealed in blood was death for you , setting you out alone
1	are they the only men alive who love their wives , those sons of atreus ?
1	so god went up against god
1	when a man 's exhausted , wine will build his strength — battle-weary as you are , fighting for your people
1	then pallas athena granted tydeus ' son diomedes strength and daring — so the fighter would shine forth and tower over the argives and win himself great glory
1	but the old seer who knew the cause full well revealed the will of the archer god apollo
1	so do not anger me now
1	he has six sons — i am the seventh — we all shook lots and it fell to me to join the armies here at troy
1	so he prayed , and far in the depths they heard him , all the nereids , phorcus ’ chorus , virgin panopea and father portunus himself , with his own mighty hand , drove the racing scylla swifter than southern winds or a winging arrow , speeding toward the shore to find her berth in the good deep-water harbor
1	just let me offer a consolation prize to a luckless man , a friend without a fault
1	and men who held nisyrus , casus and crapathus , cos , eurypylus ' town , and the islands called calydnae — combat troops , and antiphus and phidippus led them on , the two sons of the warlord thessalus , heracles ' son
1	iris , racing the wind , brushed close and whispered , come , dear girl , come quickly — so you can see what wondrous things they are doing , stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze !
1	even the pilot palinurus , high astern at his station , cries out : why such cloudbanks wrapped around the sky ?
1	one thing she never told him — his own mother — what a terrible thing had taken place : his dearest friend-in-arms on earth lay dead
1	victory comes from zeus but not for you
1	but now i will go for the others , anyone i can catch
1	where ’ s that god of ours , that eryx , tell me— our teacher once , renowned for nothing now ?
1	next in the prizes comes the one who slit the cord and last the man whose shaft had drilled the mast
1	under him sail battalions , a thousand men who put astern the walls of clusium , cosae too ; their weapons , arrows , shouldering lightweight quivers , bows bristling death
1	a new day was just about to dawn , scattering light on the mountaintops , the horses of the sun just rearing up from the ocean ’ s depths , breathing forth the light from their flaring nostrils when the latins and trojans were pacing off the dueling-ground below the great city ’ s walls , spacing the braziers out between both armies , mounding the grassy altars high to the gods they shared in common
1	when hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man 's land along his lines he strode , gripping his spear mid-haft , staving men to a standstill
1	but now pelides shaking his long-shadowed spear was charging asteropaeus , mad to cut him down — pelegon 's son , himself a son of the axius river broad and fast and acessamenus ' eldest daughter , periboea , loved by the deep-swirling stream
1	his father reared him once in the grove of mars where symaethus ’ waters swirl and a shrine to the gods of sicily stands , the palaci , quick to forgive , their altar rich with gifts— and he sent his son to war
1	but the one who takes his fill of food and wine before he grapples enemies full force , dawn to dusk — the heart in his chest keeps pounding fresh with courage , nor do his legs give out till all break off from battle
1	she wrenched her will to his
1	i look , i ca not find one
1	but hector marked him at once , rushed up to his side and staked a spear in his chest to kill the fighter right in the eyes of loyal comrades standing by
1	now , when zeus who arrays the clouds saw hector from afar , strapping on the gear of peleus ' godlike son , he shook his head and addressed his own deep heart : poor soldier
1	should he forget his fate and settle in sicily now , or head for italian shores ?
1	the salt gray sunless ocean gave you birth and the towering blank rocks — your temper 's so relentless
1	he begs you to come at once , boreas , blustering zephyr , he promises splendid victims — come with a strong blast and light the pyre where patroclus lies in state and all the argive armies mourn around him !
1	pyrrhus will soon be here , bathed in priam ’ s blood , pyrrhus who butchers sons in their fathers ’ faces , slaughters fathers at the altar
1	but ajax fired the troops on his side too : shame , you argives !
1	look — have some respect for this !
1	and now in the no man 's land two champions , greatest of all , strode and closed , both men burning for battle , aeneas son of anchises and brilliant achilles
1	these weapons , take them , pluck from the quiver an arrow fletched for vengeance !
1	and so with me , i tell you !
1	i will never behold the high and mighty pride of their palaces , the myrmidons , the dolopians , or go as a slave to some greek matron , no , not i , daughter of dardanus that i am , the wife of venus ’ son
1	hold on , full force — spur all our men to battle !
1	i hail from paeonia 's rich soil , a far cry from here , heading paeonian troops with their long spears , and this my eleventh day since raising troy
1	north we sail and skirt ceraunia ’ s cliffs to the narrow straits , the shortest route to italy , while the sun sinks and darkness shrouds the hills
1	if they promise you my reward—the fame of the work ’ s enough for me—i think i can just make out a path , under that hill , to pallanteum ’ s city walls
1	proetus ' wife , you see , was mad for bellerophon , the lovely antea lusted to couple with him , all in secret
1	i ’ ll explain in a word or so
1	and you , i say , the day draws near when off you run and pray to father zeus and the other deathless gods to make your full-maned horses swifter than hawks — whipping dust from the plain to sweep you back to troy !
1	shore up our shattered fortunes
1	come , listen to me — my plan is so much better : let us halt the war and the heat of combat now , at least for today
1	i will never rise in their defense , not against you — i would never grudge your pleasure
1	so i approach the prophet-king with questions : son of troy and seer of the gods , you know the will of phoebus apollo , know his clarian tripods and his laurel , know the stars , the cries of birds , the omens quick on the wing
1	but if they are still alive in the enemy 's camp , then we will ransom them back with bronze and gold
1	the enemy storms down on the rolling hulls nonstop , desperate , life or death
1	they slaughter the pick of yearling sheep , the old way , to ceres , giver of laws , to apollo , bacchus who sets us free and juno above all , who guards the bonds of marriage
1	hector , shining among my combat-loving comrades , i fight away from them the fatal day — but you , the vultures will eat your body raw !
1	but apollo took his stand on the massive rampart , his mind blazing with death for him but help for troy
1	but standing clear of the fray achilles ' horses wept from the time they first had sensed their driver 's death , brought down in the dust by man-killing hector
1	then , as you say , 'tomorrow at daybreak , armed to the hilt for battle ' — we slash to attack against their deep curved hulls !
1	send me back to the greeks , let me go back to fight new battles
1	there with the augur ’ s staff sat picus to the life , girt up in the short robe of state , his left hand holding the sacred buckler
1	here is a great river flowing past you , look — what help can he give you ?
1	so learn , juturna , the grief that comes your way and don ’ t blame me
1	i never looked back , she never crossed my mind— creusa , lost—not till we reached that barrow sacred to ancient ceres where , with all our people rallied at last , she alone was missing
1	under what skies and onto what coasts of the world have we been driven ?
1	but would i listen ?
1	but tell me , how do you hope to stop the men from fighting ?
1	all this will come to pass
1	he answered him warmly , winged words : antilochus , you want me to fetch an extra gift from my tents , a consolation prize for eumelus ?
1	so he prayed and the father filled with pity , seeing ajax weep
1	in a moment they had reached the immortals ' stronghold , steep olympus
1	it started all for nothing
1	she sped to the wall in panic , like a madwoman — the nurse went with her , carrying your child
1	range your men by tribes , even by clans , agamemnon , so clan fights by the side of clan , tribe by tribe
1	but now you would gladly watch ten troops of achaeans beat you to this feast , first to fight with the ruthless bronze before you !
1	and both armies now , pulling their lines tighter , trojans and lycians , myrmidons and achaeans closed around the corpse to lunge in battle — terrible war cries , stark clashing of armored men
1	so he prayed and the father filled with pity , seeing atrides weep
1	hera 's command — and hephaestus launched his grim inhuman blaze
1	but if ares or phoebus cares to start things off , if they block achilles and keep him out of action , they will have a fight on their hands , then and there , an all-out fight with us
1	or come with a word for me ?
1	that mastermind like zeus , odysseus led those fighters on
1	and i launch out in tears and desert our native land , the old safe haven , the plains where troy once stood
1	his driver out of his mind , what mind he had , lost all nerve to wheel his horses round and give the slip to his enemy 's deadly hands and staunch antilochus speared him through the midriff
1	but any man i catch , trying to skulk behind his long beaked ships , hanging back from battle — he is finished
1	our rites have already made the life of turnus mine
1	the warlords dear to the gods and flanking agamemnon strode on ahead , marshaling men-at-arms in files , and down their ranks the fiery-eyed athena bore her awesome shield of storm , ageless , deathless — a hundred golden tassels , all of them braided tight and each worth a hundred oxen , float along the front
1	is it i who try to overwhelm from the roots up your sinking phrygian state ?
1	on they went where the thickest fighting broke , churning round cebriones , dauntless polydamas , phalces , orthaeus and veteran polyphetes , palmys , hippotion 's two sons — ascanius , morys — fresh reserves just come from ascania 's fertile soil , just last morning , but now great zeus incited all-out war
1	and next , keen mnestheus took his stand , bow drawn , aiming higher , his eye and shaft both trained on the mark but he had no luck , he missed the bird itself , his shaft just slit a knot in the hempen cord that tied her foot as the dove dangled high from the soaring mast and off she flew to the south and the dark clouds
1	and paris , magnificent as a god , replied , ah hector , you criticize me fairly , yes , nothing unfair , beyond what i deserve
1	hand them over to him , the people left from the burnt ships and those worn out by the vast endeavor you ’ ve begun , your destiny , your fate
1	the queen stopped but he , warned by jupiter now , his gaze held steady , fought to master the torment in his heart
1	but the argive fighters ?
1	no good luck guides his probes , apollo the master lends no help , and all the while the ruthless horror of war grows greater , grimmer throughout the field , a disaster ever closer
1	but now — you fill me with contempt — what are you saying ?
1	and soaring ash trees ring to the two-edged iron axe and they bring down pines that towered toward the skies
1	and first they build an immense pyre of resinous pitch-pine and oaken logs , weaving into its flanks dark leaves and setting before it rows of funereal cypress , crowning it all with the herald ’ s gleaming arms
1	athena halted beside him , let her challenge fly : here 's glory , son of lycaon — let me tempt you , you with your archer 's skill !
1	book sixteen : patroclus fights and dies
1	as he hangs back , the fatal spear of aeneas streaks on— spotting a lucky opening he had flung from a distance , all his might and main
1	when zeus dispenses gifts from the jar of sorrows only , he makes a man an outcast — brutal , ravenous hunger drives him down the face of the shining earth , stalking far and wide , cursed by gods and men
1	all right then , you rutulians , beg for war !
1	i will never yield , you will never mount our towers , never drag our women back to your ships of war — i will pack you off to the god of darkness first !
1	he would just turned his chariot round in flight and once he would swerved diomedes ' spear went punching through his back , gouging his shoulder blade and driving through his chest — he spilled from the chariot , armor clanging against him
1	i do not blame agamemnon , our commander in chief , for goading his combat-ready argives into battle
1	coming by many routes , it ’ s there we meet , our rendezvous
1	driven by guilt , he looked for ways to kill me , he never rested until , making calchas his henchman— but why now ?
1	collapsing onto his wound , his armor clanging over him , pallas dies , pounding enemy earth with his bloody mouth as turnus trumpets over him : you arcadians , listen !
1	he 's made a slaughter , i tell you
1	the fates bind up the last threads of lausus ’ life as aeneas drives his tempered sword through the youth , plunging it home hilt-deep
1	here are twelve brave sons of the proud trojans — all , the fire that feeds on you devours them all but not hector the royal son of priam , hector i will never give to the hungry flames — wild dogs will bolt his flesh !
1	if fate and our own wits had not gone against us , surely laocoön would have driven us on , now , to rip the greek lair open with iron spears and troy would still be standing— proud fortress of priam , you would tower still !
1	what ’ s left for me now , after all i have endured ?
1	and then , when he sees the entire sky serene , all clear , he gives the trumpet signal from his stern and we strike camp at once , set out on our way and spread our canvas wings
1	an arcadian angler skilled at working the rivers of lerna stocked with fish , his lodgings poor , a stranger to all the gifts of the great , and his father farmed his crops on rented land
1	but you , my child , stay here by the fast ships , rage on at the achaeans , just keep clear of every foray in the fighting
1	and let her marry her phrygian lover , be his slave and give her tyrians over to your control , her dowry in your hands !
1	acestes born in troy will give you cattle , two head for every ship
1	and time and again our dardan shores have sweated blood ?
1	who was the first he slaughtered , who the last , hector the son of priam , now zeus gave him glory ?
1	he writhes in death as blood flows over his shapely limbs , his neck droops , sinking over a shoulder , limp as a crimson flower cut off by a passing plow , that droops as it dies or frail as poppies , their necks weary , bending their heads when a sudden shower weighs them down
1	so he said , and under his narrow sloped roof he led the great aeneas , laid him down on a bed of fallen leaves and the hide of a libyan bear
1	but you , you gave way to your overbearing anger , disgraced a great man the gods themselves esteem — you seized his gift of honor and keep her still
1	hector — where did you leave the captain when you came ?
1	but in charged ajax , shield like a tower before him and hector , falling back on a crowd of comrades , leapt to his chariot , flinging the burnished gear to his waiting troops to haul away to troy — trophies to be his own enormous glory
1	the son of atreus dug a heel in his heaving chest and wrenched the ash spear out
1	grand hospitality is yours , you rule so many men
1	have you no heart at all to fight the gutting fire from the fast trim ships ?
1	so great zeus declared and ordered the healing god to treat the god of war
1	and he stabbed menelaus ' round shield , full center , not battering through — the brazen point bent back in the tough armor
1	how often menelaus , my good soldier , would host him in our halls , in the old days , when he would sail across from crete
1	assigned the nearest place to the world of light , the first to rise to the air above , his blood mixed with italian blood , he bears an alban name
1	come , up with you now , climb aboard my chariot !
1	by this sign the great lord of olympus has decreed that you should bear off honors far from all the rest
1	schooled in suffering , now i learn to comfort those who suffer too
1	book one : the rage of achilles
1	where have they left their ships , what coast ?
1	i for one , i will never run from his grim assault , i will stand up to the man — see if he bears off glory or i bear it off myself !
1	his dear father has just sent for the young prince— he means the world to me—and he ’ s bound for carthage now , bearing presents saved from the sea , the flames of troy
1	he married one of adrastus ' daughters , settled down in a fine wealthy house , with plenty of grainland ringed with row on row of blooming orchards and pastures full of sheep , his own herds
1	no power can bend awry my will , not if that power sends the country avalanching into the waves , roiling all in floods and plunging the heavens into the dark pit of hell
1	true , but even on that last day , when the light of life departs , the wretches are not completely purged of all the taints , nor are they wholly freed of all the body ’ s plagues
1	no hiding your godhood , you can ’ t fool me now
1	like clashing winds in the vast heavens , bursting forth into battle , matched in spirit , in power—no gust surrendering , one to another , neither the winds nor clouds nor seas : all hangs in the balance , the world gripped in a deadlock
1	why this sudden outbreak , why these clashes ?
1	but now the son of mecisteus hacked the force from beneath them both and loosed their gleaming limbs and tore the armor off the dead men 's shoulders
1	but soon as his son tlepolemus came of age in heracles ' well-built palace walls the youngster abruptly killed his father 's uncle — the good soldier licymnius , already up in years — and quickly fitting ships , gathering partisans , he fled across the sea with threats of the sons and the sons ' sons of heracles breaking at his back
1	what god commands such power ?
1	once their hunger was put aside , their appetites content , king evander began : these annual rites , this feast , a custom ages old , this shrine to a great spirit— no hollow superstition , and no blind ignorance of the early gods has forced them on us
1	there at the very edge of the front gates springs pyrrhus , son of achilles , prancing in arms , aflash in his shimmering brazen sheath like a snake buried the whole winter long under frozen turf , swollen to bursting , fed full on poisonous weeds and now it springs into light , sloughing its old skin to glisten sleek in its newfound youth , its back slithering , coiling , its proud chest rearing high to the sun , its triple tongue flickering through its fangs
1	no fighter can battle all day long , cut-and-thrust till the sun goes down , if he is starved for food
1	but i — dear god , my life so cursed by fate
1	so you could suffer the pains of wretched men ?
1	hard by , the son of haemon and priest of phoebus and diana , his temples wreathed in the consecrated bands , all white in his robes , brilliant in his array— aeneas confronts him , coursing him down the field and rearing over him as he stumbles , slaughters him , shrouding his brilliant robes with a mighty shade
1	stunned , he recoiled , swallowing back his words like a man who threads his way through prickly brambles , pressing his full weight on the ground , and blindly treads on a lurking snake and back he shrinks in instant fear as it rears in anger , puffs its blue-black neck
1	turnus , his eyes trained on the awesome young girl , responded : pride of italy , princess , what can i do or say to show my thanks ?
1	something greater— a god—is speeding you back to greater exploits
1	so retreat to troy
1	one warrior wildly tears a helmet from his house , one yokes his panting , stamping team to a chariot , donning his shield and mail , triple-meshed in gold and he straps a trusty sword around his waist
1	join hands in pacts of peace while you still have the chance
1	i will give him the breastplate i took from asteropaeus
1	nor could the trojans once break through the argives ' bulking forward mass and force their passage through to ships and shelters
1	with that , apollo settled onto pergamus heights while murderous ares , wading into the fighting , spurred the trojan columns on to mass attack
1	the swift runner achilles reassured him quickly : all will be done , old priam , as you command
1	aeneas like aegaeon who , they say , had a hundred arms and a hundred hands , and flames blazed from his fifty maws and chests when he fought down jupiter ’ s bolts of lightning , clashing as many matching shields , unsheathing as many swords— so aeneas now , rampaging in triumph all across the plain , once his sword had warmed to the slaughter
1	healers are working over them , using all their drugs , trying to bind the wounds — but you are intractable , achilles !
1	my heart races to help our trojans — they long for me , sorely , whenever i am gone
1	soon his envoys , having covered the distance , sight the latins ’ rising roofs and towers and go up under the walls
1	all the achaean soldiers roared out their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking lord 's reply , and king agamemnon rounded on idaeus : there , there 's the achaeans ' answer , idaeus — a declaration — you can hear for yourself
1	and you , goddess , mother , don ’ t fail me in this , my hour of doubt !
1	all obey me now
1	horses go to the trojans bound for tuscan fields , and marked for aeneas , a special mount decked out in a tawny lion ’ s skin that gleams with gilded claws
1	and they listened gladly , nodding at his decision , wiped the dust from their backs and pulled their shirts on
1	there aeneas hails evander with winning words : best of the sons of greece , fortune has decreed that i pray to you for help , extend this branch of olive wound in wool
1	bronze he flung in the blaze , tough , durable bronze and tin and priceless gold and silver , and then , planting the huge anvil upon its block , he gripped his mighty hammer in one hand , the other gripped his tongs
1	wreathed in flowers the one who halloos the hunt cried out at once , your own wife , father !
1	then when the sun went down and night came on they made their beds and slept by the stern-cables
1	wounded himself , he gripped his right arm hard , aching where teucer 's arrow had hit him squarely , assaulting the argive wall , when teucer saved his men
1	and i was the first , mother , i urged them all , 'appease the god at once !
1	but while he begged the sword goes plunging clean through euryalus ’ ribs , cleaving open his white chest
1	backing him now comes periphas , giant fighter , automedon too , achilles ’ henchman , charioteer who bore the great man ’ s armor—backing pyrrhus , the young fighters from scyros raid the palace , hurling firebrands at the roofs
1	that soldier the comrades carried off but idomeneus , giving the healers orders , made for his own tent though he still yearned for action face-to-face
1	and the god-sprung hero left his spear on the bank , propped on tamarisks — in he leapt like a frenzied god , his heart racing with slaughter , only his sword in hand , whirling in circles , slashing — hideous groans breaking , fighters stabbed by the blade , water flushed with blood
1	for absent aeneas , a chariot , twin chargers too , sprung from immortal stock , their nostrils flaring fire , born of the mixed breed that crafty circe bred , making off with one of her father ’ s stallions to mate him with a mare
1	but not these trojans — no one can glut their lust for battle !
1	nor did i ever dream my leaving could have brought you so much grief
1	the queen mother burned with a will to wed him to her daughter , true , but down from the gods came sign on sign of alarm to block the way
1	how could anyone fair and just underrate your work in battle ?
1	we ’ ve other unwed girls in latian and laurentine fields , and no mean stock at that
1	call it cunning or courage : who would ask in war ?
1	confusion reigns at once , the people ’ s spirits distraught , raked by the spur of rage
1	happy , all too happy i would have been if only the trojan keels had never grazed our coast
1	orsilochus first , then ormenus , ophelestes , daetor and chromius , princely lycophontes , polyaemon 's son amopaon and melanippus too — corpse on corpse he dropped to the earth that rears us all
1	but the son of cronus , zeus , stole glaucus ' wits away
1	else i would gone down at achilles ' hands , athena 's too — the goddess sweeping before him lent the light of safety , calling achilles on that day with his bronze spear to slaughter leleges and trojans
1	as halaesus guarded imaon , the hapless fighter left his chest defenseless , bared to the arcadian lance
1	then into an ancient wood and the hidden dens of beasts they make their way , and down crash the pines , the ilex rings to the axe , the trunks of ash and oak are split by the driving wedge , and they roll huge rowans down the hilly slopes
1	but then menelaus ' pair dropped back as he yielded , cut the pace on purpose — he feared the massive teams would collide on the track and the tight-strung cars capsize , the men themselves go sprawling into the dust , striving , wild for triumph
1	on they stalked through armor and black pools of blood and suddenly reached their goal , the thracian outpost
1	draw your armies up where the wild fig tree stands , there , where the city lies most open to assault , the walls lower , easily overrun
1	all night long the ghost of stricken patroclus hovered over me , grieving , sharing warm tears , telling me , point by point , what i must do
1	father neptune , what are you whipping up for us now ?
1	three times they have tried that point , hoping to storm troy , their best fighters led by the great and little ajax , famous idomeneus , atreus ' sons , valiant diomedes
1	and there in the thick of it all the queen is mustering her armada , clacking her native rattles , still not glimpsing the twin vipers hovering at her back , as anubis barks and the queen ’ s chaos of monster gods train their spears on neptune , venus , and great minerva
1	they would never starve for fodder — crammed with the fighters — bred to eat their fill
1	cries rock the ramparts , up and down the walls— they ’ re tensing murderous bows , whipping spear-straps , weapons strewing the ground , shields and hollow helmets ringing out under impact—fighting surges , raging strong as a tempest out of the west when the kids are rising great with rain that lashes the earth , and thick and fast as the hail that stormclouds shower , pelting headlong down on the waves when jupiter fierce with southwinds spins a whirlwind , thunderheads exploding down the sky
1	so , though shame and anger spur them to all-out war , still they bar the gates , they follow their orders , armed to the hilt , protected inside the turrets , bracing for the foe
1	now 's the time for killing !
1	but catillus ’ shaft goes hammering through him , quivering out his broad back and it doubles up the man impaled with pain
1	but teucer — quick with his next shaft the archer aimed at hector , at hector 's brazen crest , and would have stopped his assault on argive ships , hit him squarely and torn his life out just as his courage peaked
1	but first antiphates , he was the first to charge , sarpedon ’ s bastard son by a mother born in thebes— but turnus cuts him down , his italian cornel spearshaft wings through the melting air and piercing the man ’ s stomach thrusts up into his chest , and froth from the wound ’ s black pit comes bubbling up as the steel heats in the lung it struck
1	with powerful hands he steps the mast from serestus ’ ship and tethers atop it , looped by a cord , a fluttering dove , a mark for steel-shod arrows
1	so he will boast , i know — let the great earth gape and take me down that day !
1	then , yes , when the king could see the man 's power at last , a true son of the gods , he pressed him hard to stay , he offered his own daughter 's hand in marriage , he gave him half his royal honors as the king
1	the longed-for day arrived as the horses of phaëthon brought the ninth dawn on through skies serene and bright
1	restless charioteers flank them , patting their chests , slapping with cupped hands , and groom their rippling manes
1	bragging so , but the whizzing arrow had not brought him down
1	down he leapt from his chariot fully armed , hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face : but the argives closed ranks , did not cave in
1	such pain as zeus has given me , above all others !
1	give him back to me , now , no more delay — i must see my son with my own eyes
1	but we do have sound advice , if only you will yield
1	a tree , once , that a craftsman ’ s hands have sheathed in hammered bronze and given the chiefs of latium ’ s state to wield
1	so white the achaeans turned beneath the dust storm now , pelting across their faces , kicked up by horses ' hoofs to the clear bronze sky — the battle joined again
1	at his last words a serpent slithered up from the shrine ’ s depths , drawing its seven huge coils , seven rolling coils calmly enfolding the tomb , gliding through the altars : his back blazed with a maze of sea-blue flecks , his scales with a sheen of gold , shimmering as a rainbow showers iridescent sunlight arcing down the clouds
1	now cheering a soldier on , tongue-lashing the next if they marked a straggler hanging back from battle : friends — you in the highest ranks of argives , you in the midst and you in rank and file , we can not all be equal in battle , ever , but now the battle lies before us all — come , see for yourselves , look straight down
1	there aphrodite quickly brought her a chair , the goddess herself with her everlasting smile , and set it down , face-to-face with paris
1	in a flash , superior numbers overwhelm us
1	i beg you , king , by the powers who know the truth , by any trust still uncorrupt in the world of men , pity a man whose torment knows no bounds
1	that achaean bulwark giant ajax came up first , broke the trojan line and brought his men some hope , spearing the bravest man the thracians fielded , acamas tall and staunch , eussorus ' son
1	high as the black-skin beans and chickpeas bounce and leap from a big bladed shovel , flying across the threshing floor , sped by a whistling wind and a winnower 's sweeping stroke — so the arrow flew from fighting atrides ' breastplate , the keen shaft glancing , skittering off downfield
1	but it 's my turn now , diomedes
1	now on we go to the latian king , his city walls
1	athena winged a heron close to their path and veering right
1	a bolt of lightning suddenly splits the heavens , drumming thunder—the world seems to fall in a flash , the blare of etruscan trumpets blasting through the sky
1	even laurentines , even latins change their tune , men who had just now longed for peace and safety long for weapons , pray the pact be dashed and pity the unjust fate that turnus faces
1	let the rest of them cut themselves to pieces on the plain !
1	the slashing spear shuddered tense in his guts and the man was gone
1	from the opposing rampart turnus saw them coming on , his italians saw them too and an icy chill of dread ran through their bones
1	they would never disengage from automedon , not without some bloodshed
1	hector far in the lead , bristling in all his force like a hound that harries a wild boar or lion — hot pursuit , snapping quick at his heels , hindquarters and flanks but still on alert for him to wheel and fight — so hector harried the long-haired argives , killing the last stragglers , man after lagging man and they , they fled in panic
1	far stronger , the king in his anger drove him out of argos , the kingdom zeus had brought beneath his scepter
1	little by little she grew cold , and wholly freed of her body , laid down her head as her neck drooped limp in the clutch of death , and she let her weapons fall
1	enough for me to escape that barbarous crew !
1	suddenly turnus flashes forward , certain he ’ s in the clear and raising his sword high , rearing to full stretch strikes—as trojans and anxious latins shout out , with the gaze of both armies riveted on the fighters
1	circling the center , ten strong rings of bronze with twenty disks of glittering tin set in , at the heart a boss of bulging blue steel and there like a crown the gorgon 's grim mask — the burning eyes , the stark , transfixing horror — and round her strode the shapes of rout and fear
1	but just as he was about to reach the steep city , up under the walls , the father of men and gods , descending out of the heavens , took his throne on the high ridge of ida with all her springs
1	urging , the goddess laid the armor down at achilles ' feet and the gear clashed out in all its blazoned glory
1	and a troop of pylian chiefs turned out in force to carve up the spoils
1	clasping our host ’ s hands , we file toward his palace
1	the field is a swirl of blinding dust , the earth quaking under their thundering tread
1	our enemies will arm us to the hilt
1	apart at the prow , aeneas takes his stand , crowned with a trim olive wreath , and raises a wine bowl high and scatters innards over the salt swell and tips out streams of wine
1	no , poseidon kept his watch and down he came to the file of kings like an old veteran now , he tugged at the right hand of atreus ' son and sent his message flying : agamemnon — now , by heaven , achilles ' murderous spirit must be leaping in his chest , filled with joy to behold his comrades slain and routed in their blood
1	but the white-armed hera saw her move at once and winged athena on : just look at them there — daughter of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder , tireless one , athena
1	the arms are enough for him — priam 's son with his empty , futile boasting
1	they rushed to arms and all the gates flung wide and the trojan mass surged out , horses , chariots , men on foot — a tremendous roar went up
1	my heart burned with longing , irresistible longing to see my old friend and learn about this remarkable twist of fate
1	your friends are restored to you , your fleet ’ s reclaimed
1	and zeus saw hector sprawled on the battlefield , his comrades kneeling round him as he panted , struggling hard for breath , his senses stunned , vomiting blood
1	but you , you just stand there — do not even command the rest to brace and defend their wives
1	he passed them on to deipylus , a friend-in-arms he prized beyond all comrades his own age — their minds worked as one — to drive to the ships as sthenelus mounted behind his own chariot now , seized the glittering reins and whipped his team , his strong-hoofed horses ahead at breakneck speed , rearing , plunging to overtake his captain diomedes but he with his ruthless bronze was hunting aphrodite — diomedes , knowing her for the coward goddess she is , none of the mighty gods who marshal men to battle , neither athena nor enyo raider of cities , not at all
1	atreus ' son drew forth the dagger always slung at his battle-sword 's big sheath , cut some tufts from the lambs ' heads , and heralds passed them round to achaean and trojan captains
1	you ’ re running away—from me ?
1	and i ’ ll be there , if i can count on your own good will in this— i ’ ll bind them in lasting marriage , make them one
1	see if i prove a coward dawn to dusk — your claim — or i stop some argive , blazing in all his power , from fighting on to shield patroclus ' corpse !
1	there was a tower soaring high at the peak toward the sky , our favorite vantage point for surveying all of troy and the greek fleet and camp
1	automedon brought the bread , set it out on the board in ample wicker baskets
1	she even darts into forests , feigning she ’ s in the grip of bacchus ’ power , daring a greater outrage , rising to greater fury , hiding her daughter deep in the mountains ’ leafy woods to rob the trojans of marriage , delay the marriage torch
1	the whole city of troy comes trampling down on us , daring , wild — why ?
1	and we , poor fools—on this , our last day—we deck the shrines of the gods with green holiday garlands all throughout the city
1	what end , great king , do you set to their ordeals ?
1	a spearhead punched his gullet under the chin and the bronze point went ripping through his nape and down the trojan fell as an oak or white poplar falls or towering pine that shipwrights up on a mountain hew down with whetted axes for sturdy ship timber — so he stretched in front of his team and chariot , sprawled and roaring , clawing the bloody dust
1	a man is down we prized on a par with noble hector — aeneas , proud anchises ' son
1	her voice rang out in tears and the women wailed in answer and hecuba led them now in a throbbing chant of sorrow : hector , dearest to me by far of all my sons
1	but when at the third assault the whole front locked fast , fighting hand-to-hand , and each man picked out his man , then , truly , the groans of the dying men break loose , weapons , bodies , a sea of blood , massacred riders , half-dead horses writhing together now in death and the pitched battle peaks
1	his was the mare atrides harnessed , champing for the race
1	but his treacherous blade breaks off , it fails turnus in mid-stroke—enraged , his one recourse , retreat , and swifter than eastwinds , turnus flies as soon as he sees that unfamiliar hilt in his hand , no defense at all
1	who knows if i will ever come back to them again ?
1	sergestus gains the lead as they near the rock but not by a whole keel ’ s length—his prow ’ s ahead but the dragon ’ s pressing prow overlaps his stern , so mnestheus , striding the gangplank , spurs his crew : now put your backs in the oars , you comrades of hector !
1	and springing out of the lines aeneas took his stand as the rest swung round and braced to meet the argives
1	so hector swooped now , swinging his whetted sword and achilles charged too , bursting with rage , barbaric , guarding his chest with the well-wrought blazoned shield , head tossing his gleaming helmet , four horns strong and the golden plumes shook that the god of fire drove in bristling thick along its ridge
1	you — you claimed your birth from a river 's broad stream ?
1	it 's no quick skirmish shaping , once the massed formations of men begin to clash with a god breathing fury in both sides at once
1	but nothing can halt the trojans ’ fierce offensive now , no weapons can stop them , nothing stand against them
1	inachus and acrisius , mycenae to the core !
1	so come — we too , old king , must think of food
1	three men killed for the one you bragged about so much !
1	the struck crag shudders , oars slamming against its riptooth edges split , and the prow driven onto the rock , hangs there , hoisted into the air
1	tomorrow aeneas and lovesick dido plan to hunt the woods together , soon as the day ’ s first light climbs high and the titan ’ s rays lay bare the earth
1	and opposing them comes antony leading on the riches of the orient , troops of every stripe— victor over the nations of the dawn and blood-red shores and in his retinue , egypt , all the might of the east and bactra , the end of the earth , and trailing in his wake , that outrage , that egyptian wife !
1	andromache pressed the child to her scented breast , smiling through her tears
1	now he 's only testing us , soon he will bear down hard
1	with you i will end , my king , with you i will begin , since you hold sway over many warriors , vast armies , and zeus has placed in your hands the royal scepter and time-honored laws , so you will advise them well
1	iris flies , arcing down on her rainbow showering iridescence , and no one sees the virgin glide along the shore , past the huge assembly , catching sight of the harbor all deserted now , and the fleet they left unguarded
1	why , it 's as if they had caught you in public , doing something wrong
1	you fool — you still have plenty of pain to suffer for her sake
1	incensed , he let loose with a bronze-tipped arrow aimed at one euchenor , son of the prophet polyidus , a decent , wealthy man who made his home in corinth
1	if only this murderous scourge drops dead beneath my strokes , back i ’ ll go to my fathers ’ towns—unsung !
1	come — now thrill to fight as before , brave among the brave , but now be braver still !
1	gripped by the same desire , all hands pitch in , they hoist and haul
1	how fate compelled the worlds of europe and asia to clash in war !
1	seizing his moment turnus calls : summon your councils , sit there praising peace !
1	she can ’ t conceive of such a fiery passion
1	now giant ajax speared him through the belt , deep in the guts the long , shadowy shaft stuck and down he fell with a crash as glorious ajax rushed to strip his armor — trojans showering spears against him , points glittering round him , his shield taking repeated hits
1	but i will blame menelaus , loved as he is and honored , even if you will wheel on me in anger — i must , i ca not hide it now
1	but all the same i will never stop till i drive the trojans to their bloody fill of war !
1	he leapt from his chariot , hit the ground at a run through enemies , trojan spears , and left his sister grieving as he went bursting through the lines
1	here wait those souls consumed by the harsh , wasting sickness , cruel love , concealed on lonely paths , shrouded by myrtle bowers
1	he pitched from his car , armor clanged against him , a glimmering blaze of metal dazzling round his back — the purebreds reared aside , hoofs pawing the air and his life and power slipped away on the wind
1	tight formations led by hector careering breakneck on like a deadly rolling boulder torn from a rock face — a river swollen with snow has wrenched it from its socket , immense floods breaking the bank 's grip , and the reckless boulder bounding high , flying with timber rumbling under it , nothing can stop it now , hurtling on undaunted down , down till it hits the level plain and then it rolls no more for all its wild rush
1	it 's solid bronze with a glittering overlay of tin , rings on rings
1	but along the shore as battle lines of breakers crashed and dragged , achilles lay down now , groaning deep from the heart , near his myrmidon force but alone on open ground where over and over rollers washed along the shore
1	but give my body to friends to carry home again , so trojan men and trojan women can do me honor with fitting rites of fire once i am dead
1	still , this time i will yield , for all my outrage
1	your sons ’ sons must keep it pure forever
1	but if you want action now — sleeping is just as hard for you , it seems — come , let 's go down to the sentry-line and see if numb with exhaustion , lack of sleep , they have nodded off , all duty wiped from their minds , the watch dissolved
1	but now , the moment the son of crooked cronus allows me to seize some glory here at the ships and pin these argives back against the sea — you fool , enough !
1	only a few , loved by impartial jove or borne aloft to the sky by their own fiery virtue—some sons of the gods have made their way
1	but achilles wept , and slipping away from his companions , far apart , sat down on the beach of the heaving gray sea and scanned the endless ocean
1	aletes , bowed with the years , a seasoned adviser , cried out : gods of our fathers , troy ’ s eternal shield !
1	the brocaded purple stirs him , king that he is , and priam ’ s scepter too , but he is stirred far more , dwelling long on his daughter ’ s marriage , her wedding bed , and mulling deeply over the vision of old faunus
1	but the god of luck now spread the gates for the old man , drove in the glinting gifts for peleus ' swift son , climbed down from behind the team and said to priam , old man , look , i am a god come down to you , i am immortal hermes — my father sent me here to be your escort
1	her phantom sifting through my fingers , light as wind , quick as a dream in flight
1	and he 's going to reap the fruits of it , i swear
1	twelve sons we were of the noble old neleus and i alone was left
1	the lord of men replied , you are right , old soldier
1	never has such a lust for goddess or mortal woman flooded my pounding heart and overwhelmed me so
1	hardy paphlagonians , working over him , hoisting him onto a chariot , bore him back to the sacred walls of troy
1	book thirteen : battling for the ships
1	he lost his reins , he lost control of his horses round the post and they failed to make the turn — that 's where he got thrown , i would say , his chariot smashed and his horses went berserk and bolted off
1	if it please the gods that nothing of our great city shall survive—if you are bent on adding your own death to the deaths of troy and of all your loved ones too , the doors of the deaths you crave are spread wide open
1	how well i knew the thrill of a boy ’ s first glory in arms , the heady sweetness of one ’ s first fame in battle
1	they obeyed and spread the bed as he ordered , with fleeces , woolen throws and soft linen sheets
1	hear the challenge of paris , the man who caused our long hard campaign
1	i had no fear of you as a captain of the greeks , arcadia-born and bound by blood to atreus ’ twin sons
1	so she cried , dashing out of the royal halls like a madwoman , her heart racing hard , her women close behind her
1	if another comrade would escort me , though , there would be more comfort in it , confidence too
1	enough—more than enough—that i have seen one sack of my city , once survived its capture
1	you fill me with contempt — what are you saying ?
1	hear your royal kings !
1	but not even then were his men without a captain , yearn as they did for their lost leader
1	do i stay with them , waiting for you to come ?
1	and deep in a hollow cave she came on thetis
1	the other girl , just now the heralds came and led her away from camp , briseus ' daughter , the prize the armies gave me
1	you and your ranting slander — you are the outrage
1	ajax skilled as a show-rider , a virtuoso horseman who picks from the herd four stallions , yokes them tight and galloping off the plain comes racing toward a large city , over a trafficked road and the crowds gaze in wonder , men and women watching , as sure-footed , never a slip , the rider keeps on leaping , swinging from back to back and the pounding team flies on
1	but now after all my trojans suffered , still the same disastrous fortune drives them on and on
1	and there in the midst , armed in gleaming bronze , in all his glory , he towered high over all his fighters — he was the greatest warlord , he led by far the largest army
1	a long wandering path will part you miles from that shore by a lengthy stretch of coast
1	your armies turning over their lives to your command — responsibilities so heavy
1	and just so on the other side achaean men-at-arms piled the corpses on the pyre , their hearts breaking , burned them down to ash and returned to the hollow ships
1	shields clang and under the trampling feet the earth quakes in fear
1	but juno , looking out from a ridge now called the alban mount— then it had neither name , renown nor glory—gazed down on the plain , on italian and trojan armies face-to-face , and latinus ’ city walls
1	and the men like gangs of reapers slashing down the reaping-rows and coming closer , closer across the field of a warlord rich in wheat or barley — swaths by the armfuls falling thick-and-fast — so achaeans and trojans closed and slashed , lunging into each other and neither side now had a thought of flight that would have meant disaster
1	seeing his anger flare , field marshal agamemnon smiled broadly and took back his taunts at once : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician , i must not bait you so beyond the limit
1	at this , the heaving rage subsides in his chest
1	so in the years to come poseidon and god apollo would set all things to rights once more
1	but once she reached the tower where soldiers massed she stopped on the rampart , looked down and saw it all — saw him dragged before the city , stallions galloping , dragging hector back to achaea 's beaked warships — ruthless work
1	and there among them a young boy plucked his lyre , so clear it could break the heart with longing , and what he sang was a dirge for the dying year , lovely
1	your armies turning over their lives to your command — responsibilities so heavy
1	and the people massed , streaming into the marketplace where a quarrel had broken out and two men struggled over the blood-price for a kinsman just murdered
1	take it to heart , i urge you
1	he summons mercury , gives him marching orders : quick , my son , away !
1	ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , god of glory !
1	and not only trojans pay the price in blood— at times the courage races back in their conquered hearts and they cut their enemies down in all their triumph
1	all face the sea at the far edge of sandy pylos and the men who live within them , rich in sheep-flocks , rich in shambling cattle , will honor him like a god with hoards of gifts and beneath his scepter 's sway live out his laws in sleek and shining peace
1	aeneas adds the scepter ilione used to bear , the eldest daughter of priam ; a necklace too , strung with pearls , and a crown of double bands , one studded with gems , the other , gold
1	they cringe from the daylight , shrink from what they ’ ve done
1	the rage of kings is strong , they are nursed by the gods , their honor comes from zeus — they are dear to zeus , the god who rules the world
1	achilles had caught them once on the spurs of ida , bound them with willow ropes as they watched their flocks and set them free for ransom
1	aeneas most of all , devoted to his shipmates , deep within himself he moans for the losses
1	and i will add a dowry , yes , a magnificent treasure the likes of which no man has ever offered with his daughter !
1	you achaeans gave her , now you have snatched her back
1	volcens burns with fury , stymied—where can he find the one who threw it ?
1	for the men will turn their minds toward home at once , and we must leave priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen , queen of argos
1	even so , we pity these argive spearmen living out their grim fates , dying in blood
1	coroebus is first to go , cut down by peneleus ’ right hand he sprawls at minerva ’ s shrine , the goddess , power of armies
1	but the giant bellowing ares had heard nothing yet of how his son went down in the mounting carnage
1	but give no ground — the charge will go to pieces
1	and the winning hero atrides gave his own prize to his herald talthybius — the king 's burnished trophy
1	but great ajax next — dear to the gods he hurled and his spear 's shadow flew and the shaft hit hector 's round shield , hit full center — straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked , tearing the war-shirt , close by hector 's flank it jabbed but the trojan swerved aside and dodged black death
1	but now , at long last , i have tasted food again and let some glistening wine go down my throat
1	next the men who lived in pylos and handsome arene , thryon , the alpheus ford and finely-masoned aepy , men who lived in cyparisseis and amphigenia , pteleos , helos and dorion where the muses met the thracian thamyris , stopped the minstrel 's song
1	never , not without a struggle , not at their royal ease are they going to board those ships !
1	others have choked the cramped streets , weapons brandished now in a battle line of naked , glinting steel tense for the kill
1	for your sake i am able to bear such hardships
1	not far from aeolian lipare flanked by sicily ’ s coast , an island of smoking boulders surges from the sea
1	at the same moment jove adeptly spurs on juno : my own sister , my sweet wife as well , it ’ s venus , just as you thought , your judgment never fails
1	minos the grand inquisitor stirs the urn , he summons the silent jury of the dead , he scans the lives of those accused , their charges
1	it reared in agony , arrow piercing its brain and flung the team in panic , writhing round the brazen point as the old horseman hewed the trace-horse clear , hacked away the straps — sudden strokes of his sword
1	achilles sprang from a goddess — one i reared myself : i brought her up and gave her in marriage to a man , to peleus , dearest to all your hearts , you gods
1	the sacred rites were all performed for the victim , the salted meal strewn , the bands tied round my head
1	so now i will tell you what seems best to me
1	diores ' rugged son automedon did his best , lashed them over and over with stinging whip — coaxing them gently now , now shouting oath on oath
1	and now i pass to the world below , my ghost in all its glory
1	nearby i chanced on a rise of ground topped off by thickets bristling dogwood and myrtle spears
1	so odysseus prayed and athena heard his prayer , put spring in his limbs , his feet , his fighting hands and just as the whole field came lunging in for the trophy ajax slipped at a dead run — athena tripped him up — right where the dung lay slick from bellowing cattle the swift runner achilles slew in patroclus ' honor
1	down and conduct king priam there through achaea 's beaked ships , so none will see him , none of the argive fighters recognize him now , not till he reaches peleus ' royal son
1	steep banks overhung its whole length , jutting up on either side and topped by stabbing rows of stakes , planted there by the argives , thickset and huge to block the enemy 's onslaught
1	let zeus decide the fates of the men of troy and men of argos both , to his deathless heart 's content — that is only right
1	now death and fate have got him in their grip
1	heading straight for the city 's lofty ramparts , ragged with thirst , choked with dust from the plain they fled as achilles stormed them , shaking his spear , that wild rabid frenzy always gripping his heart , blazing to seize his glory
1	so let her come
1	i know it all , how to charge in the rush of plunging horses — i know how to stand and fight to the finish , twist and lunge in the war-god 's deadly dance
1	none of the bronze plate could hold it , boring through the metal and skull the brazen spearpoint pounded , damasus ' brains splattered all inside his casque — polypoetes beat him down despite the trojan 's rage , then pylon and ormenus , killed and stripped them both
1	— though i or another hero drags him back in chains
1	so much to say
1	king latinus himself , shocked by the sudden crisis , leaves the council , delays his own noble plans till a better hour , over and over faults himself for not embracing trojan aeneas with open arms , adopting him as his son to shield the city
1	but pallas takes him first—hisbo rushing in fury , off his guard , berserk with his comrade ’ s death as pallas welcomes him in with the naked sword he plunges into his lungs puffed up with rage
1	now for strength , you need it !
1	she said the best of the myrmidons — while i lived — would fall at trojan hands and leave the light of day
1	how many dying bodies do you spread out on the earth ?
1	nor did your own mother lead her son ’ s cortege or seal your eyes in death or bathe your wounds or shroud you round in the festive robe i wove , speeding the work for you , laboring day and night , lightening with the loom the pains of my old age
1	he would fight to the death as a panther springs forth from her thicket lair to stand and face the huntsman : no fear in her heart , no thought of flight when she hears the baying packs — and even if he 's too quick with spear or lunging sword , even if she 's run through , she never slacks her fury until she 's charged him hard or gone down fighting
1	wild as a top , spinning under a twisted whip when boys , obsessed with their play , drive it round an empty court , the whip spinning it round in bigger rings and the boys hovering over it , spellbound , wonderstruck— the boxwood whirling , whip-strokes lashing it into life— swift as a top amata whirls through the midst of cities , people fierce in arms
1	no help to them now , the weapons of hercules , no , nor their own strong arms or their father melampus , hercules ’ mainstay , long as the earth afforded the man his grueling labors
1	and the son of cronus sends them signs on the right , zeus 's firebolts flashing
1	and round it boys and unwed girls sing hymns , thrilled to lay a hand on the dangling ropes as on and on it comes , gliding into the city , looming high over the city ’ s heart
1	so the trojans held their watch that night but not the achaeans — godsent panic seized them , comrade of bloodcurdling rout : all their best were struck by grief too much to bear
1	son of the goddess— still alive ?
1	there is a vast cave , down in the dark sounding depths , mid-sea between tenedos and imbros ' rugged cliffs
1	once they reached the ford where the river runs clear , the strong , whirling xanthus sprung of immortal zeus , hermes went his way to the steep heights of olympus as dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth , and the two men , weeping , groaning , drove the team toward troy and the mules brought on the body
1	and then , nearing the gates , thinking we ’ ve all got safely through , i suddenly seem to catch the steady tramp of marching feet and father , peering out through the darkness , cries : run for it now , my boy , you must
1	never , until i would sat you down on my knees and cut you the first bits of meat , remember ?
1	so the queen of the gods , saturn ’ s daughter swooping down from the heavens , struck the unyielding doors with her own hand , swinging them on their hinges , bursting open the iron gates of war
1	as i have seen other men who trust to their own power and striking force , their own valor , their own troop-strength — even badly outmanned — defend their country well
1	but only if phoenix wishes
1	you , hector — you are my father now , my noble mother , a brother too , and you are my husband , young and warm and strong !
1	bucolion , son himself to the lofty king laomedon , first of the line , though his mother bore the prince in secrecy and shadow
1	many captains sitting some way off , but two , veteran automedon and the fine fighter alcimus were busy serving him
1	here i sail , and here a haven , still , serene , receives our weary bodies safe and sound
1	all of it , my king , i ’ ll tell you , come what may , the whole true story
1	but the old and noble priam protested strongly : do not make me sit on a chair , achilles , prince , not while hector lies uncared-for in your camp !
1	a god ’ s come down from the sky once more—i ’ ve just seen him—urging us on to sever our mooring cables , sail at once !
1	and no forgetting the watch , each man wide awake
1	you will pay me with honors once you have won your way
1	when the first spray ’ s torn away , another takes its place , gold too , the metal breaks into leaf again , all gold
1	comrades cried out too with buoyant hearts
1	hector would not permit it
1	our wits quicker than wind , our judgment just as flighty
1	he can hardly recognize him , a cowering shadow hiding his punishments so raw
1	but any men he saw retreating from hateful battle he would lash with a sharp burst of rage : you argives — glorious braggarts !
1	the father sat there , silent
1	and again a desperate battle broke at the ships
1	here , as cacus spouts his flames in the darkness , all for nothing—hercules grapples him , knots him fast in a death-lock , throttling him , gouging out the eyes in his head , choking the blood in his gullet dry
1	he sounded out a challenge to peleus ' princely son : you missed , look — the great godlike achilles !
1	and if the gods are raging now , don ’ t let drances appease them with his death instead of mine
1	but you , mother , if you have any power at all , protect your son !
1	for my own death , i will meet it freely — whenever zeus and the other deathless gods would like to bring it on !
1	away with you , quick !
1	the track 's too narrow here — it widens soon for passing — watch out — you will crash your chariot , wreck us both !
1	exposed before our lines to fight the trojans — look how the men of troy have laid you low , trampling down our solemn , binding truce !
1	the golden boss of his shield spews streams of fire , strong as the lethal , blood-red light of comets streaming on in a clear night , or bright as the dog star , sirius , bearing plague and thirst to afflicted mortals , rises up to shroud the sky with gloom
1	but standing off to the side his guest declined : no time to sit , old soldier dear to the gods
1	i give you back to your fathers ’ ash and shades if it offers any solace
1	and you , father , glorious mars , you who command the revolving world of war beneath your sway !
1	and now , all day long till the setting sun went down they would have wept for hector there before the gates if the old man , steering the car , had not commanded , let me through with the mules !
1	send me a bird of omen , your own wind-swift messenger , the dearest bird in the world to your prophetic heart , the strongest thing on wings — clear on the right so i can see that sign with my own eyes and trust my life to it as i venture down to achaea 's ships and the fast chariot-teams !
1	but the gods ’ will spurred us on to seek your land , their power forced us here
1	so all etruria rises up in righteous fury , demanding the king , threatening swift attack
1	all submit to it now , so all the more quickly i can bring this violent business to an end
1	no trojan your rival here , no lycian can claim to be your better , no — so up with you now !
1	and the god of luck , leaping onto the chariot right behind the team , quickly grasped the whip and reins in his hands and breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses
1	— to deceive some other comrade
1	no one alters our ranked list of winners now
1	and all day long they fought at the scaean gates , that very day they would have stormed the city too , if apollo had not killed menoetius ' gallant son as he laid the trojans low — apollo cut him down among the champions there and handed hector glory
1	then picked young men and the altar priest , outdoing themselves , bring on the roasted flesh of bulls and heap the baskets high with the gifts of ceres , wheaten loaves just baked , and in bacchus ’ name they keep the winecups flowing
1	long before , his accursed doom blacked him out with idomeneus ' spear , deucalion 's noble son
1	turnus races his chariot straight through the ranks and shouts as he sees his comrades : now ’ s the time to halt your fighting !
1	the wolf himself autolycus lifted that splendid headgear out of eleon once , he stole it from ormenus ' son amyntor years ago , breaching his sturdy palace walls one night then passed it on to amphidamas , cythera-born , scandia-bound
1	sitting here , half dead — some trouble 's come your way ?
1	why recount his unspeakable murders , savage crimes ?
1	there stood arcens ’ son , decked out in brilliant gear and a war-shirt stitched blood-red with spanish dye , a fine , striking boy
1	we fight as outlaws
1	and let the king stand up before the entire army , let agamemnon swear to you his solemn , binding oath : he never mounted her bed , never once made love with her , the natural thing , my lord , men and women joined
1	and memory of my service past stands firm in grateful minds !
1	i urge them to cherish their hearths and homes , erect a citadel strong to shield them well
1	and so it is that horn-hoofed steeds are barred from diana trivia ’ s shrine and holy groves since horses , panicked by monsters of the deep , scattered the man and chariot out along the shore
1	good eurytion never grudged him this distinction , though he alone shot down the dove from the high sky
1	so lay anthemion 's son simoisius , cut down by the giant royal ajax
1	— if you could quit sarpedon , your guest and friend-in-arms abandoned there as carrion fit for the argive maws
1	next messapus , breaker of horses , neptune ’ s son , a king whom neither fire nor iron could bring down : he suddenly grasps his fighting sword again , calls back to arms his people long at peace , his rusty contingents long at rest from battle
1	guard it in your heart
1	the giant himself , his head scrapes the stars !
1	now buckling on my sword again and working my left arm through the shieldstrap , grasping it tightly , just as i was rushing out , right at the doors my wife , creusa , look , flung herself at my feet and hugged my knees and raised our little iulus up to his father
1	down from olympus , what heroics stir your heart ?
1	and now the morning star was mounting above the high crests of ida , leading on the day
1	so she threatened and helen the daughter of mighty zeus was terrified
1	so , it 's not enough that you lure defenseless women to their ruin ?
1	what acclaim from his comrades !
1	enticing so that the heart in helen 's breast began to race
1	evander , seizing the hand of his departing son , clinging , weeping inconsolably , cries out : if only jove would give me back the years , all gone , and make me the man i was , killing the front ranks just below praeneste ’ s ramparts , heaping up their shields , torching them in my triumph— my right hand sent great king erulus down to hell !
1	if a man could gather that , then make it back unharmed , why , what glory he would gain across the whole wide earth in the eyes of every man — and what a gift he would win !
1	and next with his powerful grip he snatches up a burly spear aslant an enormous central column— plunder seized from an enemy , actor—shakes it hard till the haft quivers and now , my spear , he cries , you ’ ve never failed my call , and now our time has come !
1	at that , they head for port and a following westwind bellies out their sails
1	peace from zeus , the great steward on high who rules our mortal wars ?
1	thanks to you , my sense of honor is gone , my one and only pathway to the stars , the renown i once held dear
1	they would call me their honored , loving friend forever
1	any straggler i catch , hanging back from the fleet , right here on the spot i will put that man to death
1	but great achilles knew nothing yet of patroclus ' death
1	quick as the wind now iris rushed to the goddess , urging , rise , thetis — zeus with his everlasting counsels calls you now !
1	the dense woods spread far , the thickets and black ilex bristle , briars crowd the entire place , with a rare track showing a faint trace through the thick blind glades
1	latins , keep your arms in check !
1	he inspired his heart with daring , standing near — in person , to beat away the dragging fates of death — leaning against an oak , concealed in swirls of mist
1	bearing it through the crowd achilles gave it to nestor , standing close beside him , urging , here , old friend — a trophy for you too !
1	and the mighty gods on steep olympus raged away , impotent — what could they do to set you free ?
1	what god has put such a tactic in your head ?
1	but the father knew their feelings deep within his heart and mocked them harshly : why so crushed , athena , hera ?
1	but if you are threatening some disaster , fortune , let me break this brutal life off now , now while anxieties waver and hopes for the future fade , while you , my beloved boy , my lone delight come lately , i still hold you in my embrace
1	she flashed the word in helenus ' mantic spirit — the son of priam sensed what pleased the immortals hatching instant plans , and coming up to hector advised him quickly , hector , son of priam , a mastermind like zeus , listen to me now — let your brother guide you
1	and above their onset zeus who loves the lightning launched from ida 's summits a sudden howling gale that whipped a dust storm hard against the ships , spellbinding achaean units in their tracks , handing glory to hector and hector 's trojans
1	but once he repels the roaring onslaught from the ships let him come back to me and our fast fleet — unharmed — with all my armor round him , all our comrades fighting round my friend !
1	ah then a wondrous , honored goddess comes to grace our house !
1	nine days they lay in their blood , no one to bury them — cronus ' son had turned the people into stone
1	so wildly turnus , scanning the camp and rampart , flares in anger , brute resentment sears him to the bone
1	shoulder-to-shoulder , swing to the work , we must — just two as we are — if we hope to make some headway
1	but sleep could never hold the running escort — hermes kept on turning it over in his mind
1	your shelters packed with the lion 's share of bronze , plenty of women too , crowding your lodges
1	not one of you submit to the grip of sleep — you would give great joy to the men who would take our lives
1	i wo not give up the mare !
1	king evander , founder of rome ’ s great citadel , begins : these woods the native fauns and the nymphs once held and a breed of mortals sprung from the rugged trunks of oaks
1	they keep beating his ribs , splintering sticks — their struggle child 's play till with one final shove they drive him off but not before he 's had his fill of feed
1	and so the lord of the war cry left patroclus , resisting all the way — he feared the worst : stampeded in terror , his men would leave the body easy prey for the trojans
1	they keep urging the sharp-eyed giant-killer hermes to go and steal the body
1	woman ’ s a thing that ’ s always changing , shifting like the wind
1	if you will only hear me out and take my lead , not glare at me in resentment , each of you , since i am the youngest-born in all our ranks
1	clean out the launching-channels !
1	but hector swerved his horses round at the trench 's edge , wheeling back and forth , tossing their gorgeous manes , with hector 's eyes glaring bright as a gorgon 's eyes or ares ' , man-destroying ares '
1	do not wait for the holy dawn to find us here afield , ranged by the ships — we are too far from our walls
1	and i was in their ranks , fresh out of pylos , far away from home — they enlisted me themselves and i fought on my own , a free lance , single-handed
1	with your winning words hold back each man you find — do not let them haul their rolling ships to sea !
1	but come in , rest on this seat with me , dear brother
1	leave them there , that bow and spill of arrows down on the ground — a god with a grudge against us wrecks them all
1	unlucky old acoetes , weighed down with the years , they help along as he beats his chest with fists , claws his cheeks with his nails and stumbling on , flings his full length to the ground
1	but you , my elite ones , who is ready to hack their ramparts down with the sword , to join me now and storm their panicked camp ?
1	they went straight on , shoulders shielded in oxhide tanned and tough and hammered thick with bronze
1	her gaze , her whole heart is riveted on him now , and at times she even warms him snugly in her breast , for how can she know , poor dido , what a mighty god is sinking into her , to her grief ?
1	home we go in our ships !
1	and once they reached tydides ' sturdy lodge they tethered the horses there with well-cut reins , hitching them by the trough where diomedes ' stallions pawed the ground , champing their sweet barley
1	taking their pick of daughters , tearing the sworn bride from her husband ’ s arms ?
1	but never shaken , staunch diomedes shot back , no hit — you missed !
1	you know how crammed we are inside our city , how far it is to the hills to haul in timber , and our trojans are afraid to make the journey
1	at other times i might have shrunk from the fighting , true , but not today
1	but watch , the god with a bough drenched in lethe ’ s dew and drowsy with all the river styx ’ s numbing power shakes it over the pilot ’ s temples left and right and fight as he does , his swimming eyes fall shut
1	no hope of rescue now
1	how under eurystheus he endured the countless grueling labors , juno ’ s brutal doom
1	there is a haven shaped by an island shielding the mouth of a long deep bay , its flanks breaking the force of combers pounding in from the sea while drawing them off into calm receding channels
1	but you — exalt him , olympian zeus : your urgings rule the world !
1	then down he went himself to his treasure-chamber , high-ceilinged , paneled , fragrant with cedarwood and a wealth of precious objects filled its chests
1	and first they visit the altars , make the rounds , praying the gods for blessings , shrine by shrine
1	and you beneath the ground who punish the dead — whoever broke his oath — be witness here , protect our binding pacts
1	even these trojans have their tumblers — what a leap !
1	quick , mount your chariot , mount machaon beside you — lash your team to the warships , fast , full gallop !
1	but set sail from our land , steer clear of italy ’ s coast , the closest coast to our own , washed by our own seas— every seaboard town is manned by hostile greeks
1	that is my sworn pledge
1	no man alive could keep the dog-packs off you , not if they haul in ten , twenty times that ransom and pile it here before me and promise fortunes more — no , not even if dardan priam should offer to weigh out your bulk in gold !
1	down to the ships we march and bear this corpse on high — we have won ourselves great glory
1	briseis remained untouched within my tents
1	but the greek armada was under way now , crossing over from tenedos , ships in battle formation under the moon ’ s quiet light , their silent ally , homing in on the berths they know by heart— when the king ’ s flagship sends up a signal flare , the cue for sinon , saved by the fates ’ unjust decree , and stealthily loosing the pine bolts of the horse , he unleashes the greeks shut up inside its womb
1	he too will race in flight and wing away , setting his sails to cross the farthest seas
1	not antilochus , guarded now by the god of earthquakes shielding , ringing the son of nestor round , even in this , this storm of spears
1	let each chief give commands to the tribe he leads , move them out , marshal his own contingents — now !
1	and you too , old man , we hear you prospered once : as far as lesbos , macar 's kingdom , bounds to seaward , phrygia east and upland , the hellespont vast and north — that entire realm , they say , you lorded over once , you excelled all men , old king , in sons and wealth
1	but if you will not obey his orders , if you spurn them , he threatens to come here in person , fight you down , power against power
1	where could he find them now ?
1	fill his heart with courage — so even hector learns if patroclus has the skill to fight his wars alone , my friend-in-arms , or his hands can rage unvanquished only when i go wading in and face the grind of battle
1	and covering over his wound with pain-killing drugs the healer cured him : the god was never born to die
1	all as one , his comrades murmured yes to drances ’ offer
1	you talk of food ?
1	the point 's not lodged in a mortal spot , you see ?
1	where are you going ?
1	this powerful hector will never quit the fighting , not till swift achilles rises beside the ships that day they battle against the high sterns , pinned in the fatal straits and grappling for the body of patroclus
1	he handed back the mare to antilochus ' man
1	and then , later , achaeans can work to make it broad and lofty , all who survive me here , alive in the benched ships when i am gone
1	come , stop inflaming us both with your appeals
1	such a heavy blow
1	if only the earth gaped deep enough to take me down
1	and all at once , each vessel snapping her cables free of the bank , they dive like dolphins , plunging headlong beaks to the bottom ’ s depths , then up they surface , turned into lovely virgins—wondrous omen— each a sea-nymph sweeping out to sea
1	oh , i pray you by these tears , by the faith in your right hand— what else have i left myself in all my pain ? — by our wedding vows , the marriage we began , if i deserve some decency from you now , if anything mine has ever won your heart , pity a great house about to fall , i pray you , if prayers have any place—reject this scheme of yours !
1	so often you ridicule your son with your disguises !
1	if only you ’ d left a baby in my arms—our child— before you deserted me !
1	others were pressing on , forging a chariot ’ s whirling wheels for mars to harrow men and panic towns in war
1	i fear aeneas — terribly — coming on , top speed , bearing down on me now and filled with power , enormous power to take men down in battle
1	and headlong hector , delirious with his strength , rages uncontrollably , trusting to zeus — no fear of man or god , nothing — a powerful rabid frenzy has him in its grip !
1	aeneas takes on rutulian sucro—here was the first duel that ground the trojan charge to a halt—and meets the man with no long visit , just a quick stab in his flank and the ruthless sword-blade splits the ribcage , thrusting into the heart where death comes lightning fast
1	or if i deserve it , come , hurl what ’ s left of us down to death with all your angry bolts— overwhelm us here with your iron fist !
1	oh my son , so pressed by the fate of troy—i ’ ve come by the will of jove , who swept the fire from your ships and now from the heights of heaven pities you at last
1	but turnus wastes no time , he deploys his full force quickly against the trojan force to fight them at the beaches
1	here tydeus comes to meet him , parthenopaeus shining in arms , and adrastus ’ pallid phantom
1	nothing beside those other powers , all who rush to defend the trojan armies
1	you too , i will urge you on with so much winning force
1	and now aeneas and all his trojan soldiers feast on the oxen ’ s long back cut and sacred vitals
1	it 's not your fate to be swallowed by a river : he will subside , and soon — you will see for yourself
1	five great cities , in fact , plant their anvils , forge new weapons : staunch atina , lofty tibur , ardea , crustumerium , antemnae proud with towers
1	but the father of men and gods , far from blind , throned on his steep olympian peak observes it all and stirs etruscan tarchon into the savage fighting , lashing the trooper on with the rough spur of rage
1	screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath , fighters killing , fighters killed , and the ground streamed blood
1	so at dawn you must call a halt to fighting by achaeans , form your units , bring on wagons , gather up the dead and wheel the corpses back with mules and oxen
1	lost to her friends , her son , her husband—gone forever
1	as soon as he heard that , the god of earthquakes surged through the clashing troops and raining spears to reach the place where the two famed heroes fought
1	oh how i wish that first day my mother brought me into the light some black whirlwind had rushed me out to the mountains or into the surf where the roaring breakers crash and drag and the waves had swept me off before all this had happened !
1	hector drove them on with winging orders : hear me — numberless tribes of allies living round our borders — i neither sought nor needed enormous hordes of men that day i called you here , each from your own city
1	the hardy spearman meriones shot back , aeneas — great man of war as you are , you will find it hard to quench the fire of every man who fights you
1	such talk the sordid goddess spreads on the lips of men , then swerves in her course and heading straight for king iarbas , stokes his heart with hearsay , piling fuel on his fire
1	be with me now , just as you went with father , veteran tydeus , into thebes that day he ran ahead of the argives with his message
1	not one of you leaves and lacks a gift from me
1	courage , my friends , hold out a little longer
1	amphidamas gave it to molus , a guest-gift once that molus gave meriones his son to wear in battle
1	something terrible 's coming down on priam 's children
1	so you will bring some joy to achaea 's forces camped beside their ships , and most of all to your own troops , the comrades you command
1	and polydamas stood by headstrong hector , saying , hector , you always seem to attack me in assembly , despite my good advice
1	i owed a price to my land and people who despise me
1	but since you would like a lesson in warfare , artemis , just to learn , to savor how much stronger i am when you engage my power —
1	that eagle flying high on the left across our front , clutching this bloody serpent in both its talons , still alive — but he let the monster drop at once , before he could sweep it back to his own home
1	the enemy 's battle-weary — we could roll those broken trojans back to troy , clear of the ships and shelters !
1	deiphobus shouted , vaunting in wild glory , asius dies , but not without revenge !
1	that is the only field left free to you now , to prove your worth and fortune
1	one he stabbed with a bronze lance above the nipple , the other his heavy sword hacked at the collarbone , right on the shoulder , cleaving the whole shoulder clear of neck and back
1	seven chiefs of the guard , a hundred under each , fighters marching , grasping long spears in their hands , took up new positions between the trench and rampart
1	i bring you a message sent by zeus , a world away but he has you in his heart , he pities you now
1	dare to scoff at riches
1	guest ’ —that ’ s all that remains of husband ’ now
1	but now , wild as a black cyclone twisting out of a cloudbank , building up from the day 's heat , blasts and towers — so brazen ares looked to tydeus ' son diomedes
1	but charging down on the trojans ajax killed doryclus , bastard son of priam — he wounded pandocus next , wounded lysander , pyrasus , then pylartes
1	here dido of tyre was building juno a mighty temple , rich with gifts and the goddess ’ aura of power
1	you with the north wind 's help had coaxed the gales to send him scudding over the barren salt sea — you , always plotting miseries for my son , you bore him off to the crowded town of cos but there i saved him , whisked him away to safety , back to the stallion-land of argos , worn with torment
1	but achilles held the armies on the spot
1	now is the time to prove yourself a spearman , a daring man of war — now , if you are brave , make grueling battle your one consuming passion
1	and loud as the roar goes up when men cut timber deep in the mountain glades and the pounding din of axes echoes miles away — so the pound and thud of blows came rising up from the broad earth , from the trampled paths of war and the bronze shields and tough plied hides struck hard as the swords and two-edged spearheads stabbed against them
1	see to the works of marriage , the slow fires of longing
1	treasures are piled up in my rich father 's house , bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron — father would give you anything , gladly , priceless ransom if only he learns i am still alive in argive ships !
1	lash your racing horses at ares first , strike him at close range , no shrinking away here before that headlong ares !
1	here she kept her armor , here her chariot too , and carthage would rule the nations of the earth if only the fates were willing
1	but not the great field marshal agamemnon — the sweet embrace of sleep could not hold him : his mind kept churning , seething
1	but why , i ask you ?
1	you , why are you so afraid of war and slaughter ?
1	the troops hung on his words and took his orders
1	but zeus flung strife on achaea 's fast ships , the brutal goddess flaring his storm-shield , his monstrous sign of war in both her fists
1	look at her beauty , her fiery eyes , immortal marks— what pride , what features , and what a voice , what stride !
1	and then aeneas orders a hundred envoys , picked from all ranks , to approach the king ’ s imperial city—bearing an olive branch of pallas wound in wool , bearing gifts for the great man— and sue for peace for all the trojan people
1	but i , if i should die , my comrades-in-arms will bury me in style !
1	soon as they had gathered within the warlord 's tents he sacrificed an ox in their midst , a full-grown ox , five years old , to the towering son of cronus , zeus
1	far in the palace depths there stood a laurel , its foliage sacred , tended with awe for many years
1	not a word to achilles , not a question
1	so immense the clash as the war of gods erupted
1	death cut him short
1	like him , apollo the son of zeus incited hector : hector , why stop fighting ?
1	he is only the third to offer up to father quirinus the enemy ’ s captured arms
1	now then , first look up at this crag with its overhanging rocks , the boulders strewn afar
1	or call his armies now to rally within the ramparts ?
1	he has no idea of the anguish risen through the army !
1	let the whole myrmidon army follow your command — you might bring some light of victory to our argives !
1	and let the hero patroclus bear it on his way
1	but their master hurled from the chariot , tumbling over the wheel and pitching facedown in the dust , and above him now rose menelaus , his spear 's long shadow looming
1	by skill , too , the captain holds his ship on course , scudding the wine-dark sea though rocked by gales
1	patroclus — who was the first you slaughtered , who the last when the great gods called you down to death ?
1	you , you ’ ll never lose your life , such as it is , not by my right hand—fear not—just let it rest , beating inside that coward ’ s chest of yours !
1	all power is yours
1	they beat the helmets hollow to guard the head , they weave the wicker tight to rib their shields , others are pounding breastplates out of bronze , hammering lightweight greaves from pliant silver
1	the cyclops were forging iron now in the huge cave : thunder and lightning and fire-anvil stripped bare
1	but if only zeus would stretch the ropes of war dead even the man would have no easy victory then , believe me — not though he claims he 's built of solid bronze !
1	i , at least , have no real lust to drive our forces against the gods of troy
1	that moment at jove ’ s command he carries on the fight , attacks the victorious trojans , true , but his own etruscan troops with all their hate and showering weapons rush to attack him quite alone , their one and only target
1	no , this sword and the man who wields it , the wounds they deal are fatal !
1	do not leap to extremes
1	each captain ordered his men and the ranks moved on in silence
1	now up they came for a better view of the battle , a slow file of kings , leaning on their spears , hearts in their chests weighed down with anguish — and the sight of the old horseman coming toward them struck them all with a sharper sense of dread
1	i have lived a life
1	whenever i longed to fight at the ships ' high sterns the old men kept me back , they held the troops in check
1	so the rule of all aetolian men had passed to thoas
1	but once he crashed against those dense battalions dead in his tracks he stopped , crushed up against them : sons of achaea faced him now , stabbing away with swords , with two-edged spears , hoisting him off their lines — and he gave ground , staggering , reeling , shouting out to his troops with shrill cries , trojans !
1	patroclus never saw him coming , moving across the deadly rout , shrouded in thick mist and on he came against him and looming up behind him now — slammed his broad shoulders and back with the god 's flat hand and his eyes spun as apollo knocked the helmet off his head and under his horses ' hoofs it tumbled , clattering on with its four forged horns and its hollow blank eyes and its plumes were all smeared in the bloody dust
1	suddenly right before camilla , stunned with terror to see her here , stands aunus ’ fighting son , an apennine man and not the least of liguria ’ s liars while the fates allow
1	but he bore a son who 's not the half of him in battle — better only in wrangling , wars of words !
1	aeneas , moreover , offers you these gifts , remains of his former riches , meager relics plucked from the fires of burning troy
1	he quickly loosed an arrow , full-draw force but never swore to the archer he would slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs , so he missed the dove — apollo grudged him that — but he hit the cord that tethered the bird 's foot , the tearing arrow split the cord straight through and the bird shot into the sky and left the tether dangling down to ground
1	and assaracus fathered capys , and he had a son anchises and anchises fathered me , but priam had prince hector
1	others seize on weapons , rush to defend the ramparts
1	smiling down , the creator of man and the wide world returned : now there ’ s my sister
1	all the while the trojans along the shore keep weeping for misenus , paying his thankless ashes final rites
1	all empty noise , your peals of grumbling thunder ?
1	that was the only way you could destroy me
1	even now in the face of all the immortal gods she harries me perpetually , hera charges me that i always go to battle for the trojans
1	the ferryman , marveling at the awesome gift , the fateful branch unseen so many years , swerves his dusky craft and approaches shore
1	but he kept shouting at agamemnon , spewing his abuse : still moaning and groaning , mighty atrides — why now ?
1	then , with the guests gone , and the dimming moon quenching its light in turn , and the setting stars inclining heads to sleep—alone in the echoing hall , distraught , she flings herself on the couch that he left empty
1	and then , if we can journey home to achaean argos , pride of the breasting earth , you will be his son-by-marriage
1	quickly achilles displayed before the troops the prizes set for the third event , the grueling wrestling-match
1	idomeneus suddenly called to nestor , pride of achaea !
1	cut off from life so young !
1	a gift of the son of cronus , zeus — apollo too — they brought me down with all their deathless ease , they are the ones who tore the armor off my back
1	it 's only youth that got the better of your discretion , just this once — but the next time be more careful
1	and he excelled all argives with his spear — you must have heard the story , know it 's true
1	now they see a pillar of dust upholding the sky and the horsemen riding on and dense salvos of weapons raining down in the camp ’ s heart , and the cries of torment reach the heavens as young men fight and die beneath the iron fist of mars
1	but even for me , i tell you , death and the strong force of fate are waiting
1	he obeyed the order
1	such was the fear that broke them , man for man , but the heart within me broke with grief for you
1	you ca not persuade me now
1	still , anna can not imagine these outlandish rites would mask her sister ’ s death
1	the bright-eyed goddess pallas lost no time
1	so each man tense with courage — fight the trojans down !
1	not even achilles can bring off all his boasts : some he will accomplish , some cut short , half done
1	three times illustrious hector shouted for support , seized his feet from behind , wild to drag him off , three times the aeantes , armored in battle-fury fought him off the corpse
1	and scanning the melee , high on actium ’ s heights apollo bent his bow and terror struck them all , egypt and india , all the arabians , all the sabaeans wheeled in their tracks and fled , and the queen herself— you could see her calling , tempting the winds , her sails spreading and now , now about to let her sheets run free
1	now nisus guarded a gate— matchless in battle , hyrtacus ’ son , aeneas ’ comrade
1	do we still flinch from turning our valor into deeds ?
1	our young men , calloused by labor , used to iron rations , tame the earth with mattocks or shatter towns with war
1	and he , stalking turnus through the moil of battle , aeneas ’ glances roving left and right , sights the town untouched by this ruthless war , immune , at peace and an instant vision of fiercer combat fires his soul
1	groans resound from the depths , the savage crack of the lash , the grating creak of iron , the clank of dragging chains
1	squads of others swarmed and rallied around polydamas , panthous ' friendly son — they would heard hector 's orders
1	by chance a wild olive , green with its bitter leaves , stood right here , sacred to faunus , revered by men in the old days , sailors saved from shipwreck
1	but not the tragic queen
1	no more of your hot insistence — it repels me
1	still dragging out my life
1	prove your will with works
1	transgressors will pay the price , a tremendous price , with their own heads , their wives and all their children
1	and veteran lycomedes pitied him as he dropped , sweeping beside him , rearing — a flash of his lance and he hit a captain , hippasus ' son apisaon , slitting open his liver , up under the midriff
1	but prize trophies go to the three front-runners , brows crowned with the wreaths of braided golden olive
1	the gods on high — they hold the ropes of victory in their hands !
1	i am , i confess , a man from the greek fleets , i admit i fought to seize your household gods
1	under your lead , let him grow hard to a soldier ’ s life and the rough work of war
1	no use , no use as his right hand tugs at the shaft and his clamping forceps grip the iron point
1	learn good luck from others
1	so i had to reach the front lines on foot but i shone among our horsemen all the same — that 's how athena called the turns of battle
1	he rushed at the maenads once , nurses of wild dionysus , scattered them breakneck down the holy mountain nysa
1	and juno replies , her head bent low : my dearest husband , why rake my anxious heart ?
1	if i hold out here and i lay siege to troy , my journey home is gone , but my glory never dies
1	hera deceived him blind — feminine as she is , and only armed with guile — that day in thebes , ringed with tower on tower , alcmena was poised to bear invincible heracles
1	and if only one would go and call the rest , giant ajax strong as a god and king idomeneus — they are hardly close , their ships last on the line
1	from there you could hear the furious growls of lions bridling at their chains , roaring into the dead of night , the raging of bristly boars and bears caged in their pens and the looming forms of howling wolves : the men whose shapes the brutal goddess circe changed with her potent drugs , tricked them out in the hides and look of wild beasts
1	a stunned silence seized them all , struck dumb — zeus 's ringing pronouncements overwhelmed them so
1	achilles served the meat
1	if one strong arm could have saved troy , my arm would have saved the city
1	and now they stretched the line of battle strangling tight , the blue-haired god of the sea and hector fired in arms , he driving the trojans , the god driving the argives — and a wild surf pounded the ships and shelters , squadrons clashed with shattering war cries rising
1	so great ajax vaunted and men prayed to the son of cronus , king zeus
1	we breach our own ramparts , fling our defenses open , all pitch into the work
1	with those words he left her in chryses ' arms and the priest embraced the child he loved , exultant
1	pandarus , seeing his brother ’ s body spread on the ground and sensing how fortune falls— disaster rules the day—with all his might he rams his massive shoulder into the gate and wheels it shut on its hinges , shuts out many comrades now outside the ramparts , facing an uphill battle , and shuts in many others , ushering fighters home as in they rush , along with himself , the crazy fool— not to have spotted turnus charging in with the crowds and all unwittingly shut him up inside the walls like a claw-mad tiger among some helpless flock
1	do not alarm the men , not for a moment
1	the third battalion was led by brave pisander , maemalus ' son , who outfought them all with spears , all the myrmidons after achilles ' friend patroclus
1	so the ramping , crested aeantes hoisted imbrius high , stripping his gear in mid-air , and the little ajax , raging over amphimachus ' death , lopped the head from the corpse 's limp neck and with one good heave sent it spinning into the milling fighters like a ball , right at the feet of hector , tumbling in the dust
1	paris lies dead in the city of his fathers , mimas lies unsung on the latian shores
1	still , by god , i said i would not relax my anger , not till the cries and carnage reached my own ships
1	first then , back to the looming walls , the shadowy rear gates by which i ’ d left the city , back i go in my tracks , retracing , straining to find my footsteps in the dark , with terror at every turn , the very silence makes me cringe
1	but take this command to heart — obey it to the end
1	and away i fled through the whole expanse of hellas and gaining the good dark soil of phthia , mother of flocks , i reached the king , and peleus gave me a royal welcome
1	but now racing achilles makes my blood run cold
1	so hector vowed — with an oath he swore in vain but it spurred the man to action
1	first , for the fastest charioteers he set out glittering prizes : a woman to lead away , flawless , skilled in crafts , and a two-eared tripod , twenty-two measures deep — all that for the first prize
1	aground on the shoals , long impaled on a jagged reef it teeters back and forth , tiring the waves—and suddenly breaks up , flinging crews in the surf , ensnared in the shattered oars and bobbing thwarts as the heavy backwash drags their feet from shore
1	with that , shaft poised , he hurled and his spear 's long shadow flew but seeing it coming glorious hector ducked away , crouching down , watching the bronze tip fly past and stab the earth — but athena snatched it up and passed it back to achilles and hector the gallant captain never saw her
1	unlucky man , you must behold the agonizing burial of your son
1	here ’ s one who bartered his native land for gold , he saddled her with a tyrant , set up laws for a bribe , for a bribe he struck them down
1	a great joy to the trojans , massing packs of them swarming round the corpse but achaean forces never slacked their drive , their juggernaut fury bore them breakneck on
1	and any god i caught i would seize and send him plunging over the ramparts , headfirst till he hit the earth , barely alive
1	don ’ t hold me back
1	soon as the giant gained deep water and offshore swells , he washed the blood still trickling down from his dug-out socket , gnashing his teeth , groaning , and wades out in the surf but the breakers still can ’ t douse his soaring thighs
1	you ’ ll never see me disgraced again—no more
1	dido burns with love—the tragic queen
1	as ilioneus ends his appeal , latinus keeps on looking down at the ground , stock-still , only his eyes moving , rapt in concentration
1	cringe with shame at the thought they will strip his gear and maim his corpse — these myrmidons , seething for all the argive troops we killed , we speared to death against their fast trim ships !
1	i live on the meager fare the branches offer , berries and cornel nuts as hard as rocks , and feed on roots i tear from the earth
1	so dido , doomed , was lengthening out the night by trading tales as she drank long draughts of love—asking aeneas question on question , now about priam , now hector , what armor memnon , son of the morning , wore at troy , how swift were the horses of diomedes ?
1	young pallas , whom turnus had overpowered , taken down with a wound , and now his shoulder flaunted his enemy ’ s battle-emblem like a trophy
1	but the two aeantes blazing in battle-fury saw to imbrius now
1	it does you proud to stand by me , my friend , to attack the man who attacks me — be king on a par with me , take half my honors !
1	better times may come to those in pain
1	but zeus could never think of ruin without a groan whenever he saw heracles , his own dear son endure some shameful labor eurystheus forced upon him
1	only three summers will see him govern latium , three winters pass in barracks after the latins have been broken
1	and ilus , in turn , sired a valiant son laomedon , laomedon had his sons as well , tithonus and priam , lampus and clytius , hicetaon the gallant aide of ares
1	his heart 's so game , his fighting edge so keen , the best of us all in every combat mission — athena loves the man
1	i had to spare my teams
1	a city is what they pray for
1	once you have passed them all , moored your ships on the far shore and set up altars on the beach to perform your vows , then cloak yourselves in purple , veil your heads , so while the hallowed fires are burning in honor of the gods , no enemy presence can break in and disrupt the omens
1	never flustered , the cool-headed meriones took his point : idomeneus , captain of cretans under arms , i have come for a spear to fight with , if you still have one left inside your tents
1	but aphrodite rounded on her in fury : do not provoke me — wretched , headstrong girl !
1	you have stopped my fighting against the trojans , true , but i tell you here and now that a dark , bloody doom will take you down today — gouged by my spear you will give me glory now , you will give your life to the famous horseman death !
1	your own good team ?
1	where are they sleeping ?
1	achilles next — he hurled his spear and its long shadow flew and the weapon struck the balanced round shield of aeneas under the outer rim where the bronze ran thinnest , backed by the thinnest bull's-hide
1	the troops themselves had no fear , no dread of the trojans ' power and breakneck charges , no , they stood their ground like heavy thunderheads stacked up on the towering mountaintops by cronus ' son , stock-still in a windless calm when the raging north wind and his gusty ripping friends that had screamed down to rout dark clouds have fallen dead asleep
1	then down the entire shore they watch their comrades burn as men stand guard at the pyres now dying out
1	aphrodite the daughter of zeus replied at once , hera , queen of the skies , daughter of mighty cronus , tell me what 's on your mind
1	so these two brothers , laid low by the two brothers , dropped to the world of night : sarpedon 's stalwart cohorts , spearmen sons of amisodarus — he who bred the chimaera , the grim monster that sent so many men to death
1	he surged along the achaean ships and shelters , spurring argives , piling griefs on trojans
1	the trophies lie afield — they await the charioteers
1	but aeneas , duty-bound , his mind restless with worries all that night , reached a firm resolve as the fresh day broke
1	your hopes soar , i suppose , to gut and crush our ships ?
1	their prayers rose and pallas athena heard them
1	some press hard for an entry , scaling the walls with ladders , wherever a gap shows in the thin defensive ring and light breaks through
1	euryalus killed dresus , killed opheltius , turned and went for pedasus and aesepus , twins the nymph of the spring abarbarea bore bucolion
1	but two i can not find , and they are captains of the armies , castor breaker of horses and the hardy boxer polydeuces
1	the old men bent with age , the women sick of the sea , ones who are feeble , ones who shrink from danger : set them apart , and exhausted as they are , let them have their walls within this land
1	what work for the gods who live on high , what a concern to ruffle their repose !
1	but still , ravishing as she is , let her go home in the long ships and not be left behind
1	so many chosen captains heading thirty warships , speeding to rescue troy , cleft the fields of salt with beaks of bronze
1	that moment the lines of fighters buckle , latins , routed , sling their shields on their backs and wheel their horses round to the walls as the trojans drive them on with asilas in the lead , his squadrons charging
1	venus ’ son will be the same—a paris reborn , a funeral torch to consume a second troy !
1	just set my daughter free , my dear one
1	nor will italy once regret embracing troy in her heart
1	but he could not dodge the lightning mind of zeus — standing guard over hector zeus tore the glory right from teucer 's grasp , he snapped the twisted cord on his handsome bow just as the archer drew it taut against his man and the weighted bronze shaft skittered off to the side , the bow dropped from his hand and teucer shuddered , calling out to his brother , oh what luck — look , some power cuts us out of the fighting , foils our plans !
1	you cruel , heartless—even if you were not pursuing alien fields and unknown homes , even if ancient troy were standing , still , who ’ d sail for troy across such heaving seas ?
1	if i leave this splendid gear and desert patroclus — who fell here fighting , all to redeem my honor — wo not any comrade curse me , seeing me break away ?
1	too fast for them , here was a ring of trojan chiefs : aeneas , polydamas and the royal prince agenor , sarpedon the lycians ' captain , valiant glaucus — and all their troops spared nothing , pitching in , bracing their thick bulging shields to cover hector
1	those words re-echoing from her shrine , the cumaean sibyl chants her riddling visions filled with dread , her cave resounds as she shrouds the truth in darkness—phoebus whips her on in all her frenzy , twisting his spurs below her breast
1	yes , latin and trojan blood will be your dowry , princess— bellona , goddess of war , your maid-of-honor !
1	he yearns to be gone , to desert this land he loves , thunderstruck by the warnings , jupiter ’ s command
1	first , the sky and the earth and the flowing fields of the sea , the shining orb of the moon and the titan sun , the stars : an inner spirit feeds them , coursing through all their limbs , mind stirs the mass and their fusion brings the world to birth
1	my own mind 's made up to give you back your son
1	then no delay , tarchon joins forces at once and seals a pact
1	next aeneas sees troilus in flight , his weapons flung aside , unlucky boy , no match for achilles ’ onslaught— horses haul him on , tangled behind an empty war-car , flat on his back , clinging still to the reins , his neck and hair dragging along the ground , the butt of his javelin scrawling zigzags in the dust
1	but fetch me another prize , and straight off too , else i alone of the argives go without my honor
1	and seeing him gleam in armor , puffed with pride , why running away ?
1	jupiter rises up from his golden throne as the gods of heaven flock around him there and escort him to the gateway of his mansion
1	as his racing spirit veered back and forth , just as he drew his huge blade from its sheath , down from the vaulting heavens swept athena , the white-armed goddess hera sped her down : hera loved both men and cared for both alike
1	now nearing the finish , that left one , cloanthus— mnestheus goes for him all-out , urging his crews to give it all they ’ ve got
1	the same honors await you , one and all
1	who has not heard of aeneas ’ people , his city , troy , her men , her heroes , the flames of that horrendous war ?
1	rumor flies , and the hearts of latian mothers flare up with the same fury , the same frenzy spurs them to seek new homes
1	i am on my way over there to meet this new assault — i will soon be back , once i have given them clear commands
1	you must bear up now
1	kneading her skin with this to a soft glow and combing her hair , she twisted her braids with expert hands , and sleek , luxurious , shining down from her deathless head they fell , cascading
1	hector — whipping the fight and fire in each man like a huntsman crying on his hounds , their white fangs flashing , harrying savage game , some wild boar or lion — so at achaea 's ranks he drove his fearless trojans , hector son of priam , a match for murderous ares
1	my glittering war-belt stopped the shot in front , my loin-piece and the plated guard below it , gear the bronzesmiths hammered out for me
1	here ’ s murranus sounding off the names of his forebears , all his fathers ’ fathers ’ line from the start of time , his entire race come down from the latin kings
1	bring on the sacred rites , father , draft our binding terms
1	it must be his own great rage that drives him on — he pitied the sight of argives pinned against their ships
1	the goddess threw her snow-white arms around him as he held back , caressing him here and there , and suddenly he caught fire—the same old story , the flame he knew by heart went running through him , melting him to the marrow of his bones
1	this armor he gives mnestheus , a fighter ’ s badge of honor to shield him well in war
1	— trojans stormed over the rampart , lashing their teams to fight against the ships , hurling their two-edged spears at close range there , trojans from lurching cars but achaeans from high decks , scrambling aloft black hulls , lunged down with the long pikes — jointed and clinched and tipped with ripping bronze — they would kept on board for bloody fights at sea
1	you would think they waded into the fighting , fresh troops , unbruised , unbroken , they fought with such new fire
1	the rest of you : down you go , go to trojans , go to achaeans
1	and the men who settled argissa and gyrtone , orthe , elone , the gleaming citadel oloosson : polypoetes braced for battle led them on , the son of pirithous , son of deathless zeus
1	messapus levels clonius , then lycaon ’ s son , erichaetes , one thrown from a reinless horse and sprawled aground , the other fighting on foot
1	still , head to foot a greek , a man once sent to troy equipped with his country ’ s arms
1	there 's an old tale i remember , an ancient exploit , nothing recent , but this is how it went
1	doomed to live forever ?
1	but dido , trembling , desperate now with the monstrous thing afoot— her bloodshot eyes rolling , quivering cheeks blotched and pale with imminent death—goes bursting through the doors to the inner courtyard , clambers in frenzy up the soaring pyre and unsheathes a sword , a trojan sword she once sought as a gift , but not for such an end
1	at the giant 's command the earth ran red with blood , slithering dark now and the soldiers ' corpses tumbling thick-and-fast , trojans and breakneck allies piled alongside argives — how could the argives fight without some bloody losses ?
1	lionhearted ajax and menelaus were not blind
1	reaching out his arms , again and again he prayed to his dear mother : mother !
1	never right , is it , for a common man to speak against you , king , never in open council , and god forbid in war
1	how he would whine to the high skies — till father zeus would rush me down from the clouds to save his life
1	chilling tremors shook the trojans ' knees , down to the last man , terrified at the sight : the headlong runner coming , gleaming in all his gear , afire like man-destroying ares
1	but atreus ' son the fighting menelaus marked it all — the trojans killing patroclus there in the brutal carnage — and crested now in his gleaming bronze gear atrides plowed through the front to stand astride the body , braced like a mother cow lowing over a calf , her first-born , first labor-pangs she would felt
1	hippodamas next , he leapt from his chariot fleeing before achilles — achilles ' spearshaft rammed him through the back and he gasped his life away , bellowing like some bull that chokes and grunts when the young boys drag him round the lord of helice 's shrine and the earthquake god delights to see them dragging — so he bellowed now and the man 's proud spirit left his bones behind
1	hector waiting , watching the greathearted patroclus trying to stagger free , seeing him wounded there with the sharp bronze came rushing into him right across the lines and rammed his spearshaft home , stabbing deep in the bowels , and the brazen point went jutting straight out through patroclus ' back
1	and iris riding the wind obeyed his orders , swooping down from ida 's peaks to sacred troy
1	he will gladly sink to a knee and rest , i would say , if the man comes through alive from the fight he begs for , dueling to the death
1	tell me , be precise about it — how many days do you need to bury prince hector ?
1	book eight : the tide of battle turns
1	the dead of night , and weary living creatures throughout the world are enjoying peaceful sleep
1	and immortal sea-nymphs gathered round their sister , all the nereids dwelling down the sounding depths , they all came rushing now — glitter , blossoming spray and the swells ' embrace , fair-isle and shadowy cavern , mist and spindrift , ocean nymphs of the glances pooling deep and dark , race-with-the-waves and headlands ' hope and safe haven , glimmer of honey , suave-and-soothing , whirlpool , brilliance , bounty and first light and speeder of ships and buoyant power , welcome home and bather of meadows and master 's lovely consort , gift of the sea , eyes of the world and the famous milk-white calm and truth and never-wrong and the queen who rules the tides in beauty and in rushed glory and healer of men and the one who rescues kings and sparkler , down-from-the-cliffs , sleek-haired strands of sand and all the rest of the nereids dwelling down the depths
1	but i will declare my inmost feelings to achilles
1	he 's just assaulted love , he stabbed her wrist — like something superhuman he even charged at me !
1	he broke up the assembly at once
1	with good will to the lords he rose and spoke : king agamemnon , chiefs of all the argives — how many long-haired achaeans lie here dead !
1	the father of men and gods replied sharply , hera — stop hoping to fathom all my thoughts
1	but phoebus apollo called to blazing ares , ares , ares , destroyer of men , reeking blood , stormer of ramparts , ca not you go and drag that man from the fighting ?
1	you have your mother 's uncontrollable rage — incorrigible , that hera — say what i will , i can hardly keep her down
1	i with the same high honors ?
1	the spearman diomedes served as the man 's second , goading him on , intent to see him win
1	he cried , i beg you , pity me !
1	but to spare the loyal trojans such a monstrous fate— risking that harbor , touching those lethal shores— neptune swelled their sails with following winds and gave them a swift escape , speeding them past the churning shoals unharmed
1	but meriones , taking aim at deiphobus , hurled his flashing spear and struck — no miss !
1	but if you love hector , if you hold him dear , at least give both men equal strength and glory
1	but come , while i strap my battle-armor on , all of you pray to cronus ' son , almighty zeus
1	turning their eyes to face the rising sun , the captains reach out their hands , pouring the salted meal , and mark off the brows of the victims , cutting tufts with iron blades , and tip their cups on the sacred altar fires
1	we see them standing there , powerless , each with his one glaring eye , their heads towering up , an horrendous muster looming into the vaulting sky like mountain oaks or cypress heavy with cones in jupiter ’ s soaring woods or diana ’ s sacred grove
1	i tell you this and i will fulfill it too : i will maim their racers for them , right beneath their yokes , and those two goddesses , i will hurl them from their chariot , smash their car , and not once in the course of ten slow wheeling years will they heal the wounds my lightning bolt rips open
1	why did he grant me life eternal—rob me of our one privilege , death ?
1	ocnus too , heading an army come from native coasts , a son of manto the seer and the tuscan river tiber
1	he summons mnestheus , sergestus , staunch serestus , gives them orders : fit out the fleet , but not a word
1	all were sick of struggling with the sea
1	at boxing i destroyed clytomedes , enops ' boy
1	and his loving father laughed , his mother laughed as well , and glorious hector , quickly lifting the helmet from his head , set it down on the ground , fiery in the sunlight , and raising his son he kissed him , tossed him in his arms , lifting a prayer to zeus and the other deathless gods : zeus , all you immortals !
1	so come , friends , do as i say — all take my lead
1	amphimachus and nastes led their formations on , nastes and amphimachus , nomion 's flamboyant sons
1	allecto—a joy to her heart , the griefs of war , rage , and murderous plots , and grisly crimes
1	under his auspices , watch , my son , our brilliant rome will extend her empire far and wide as the earth , her spirit high as olympus
1	come , prince , if you have the spine , if you have any spark of your fathers ’ warring spirit , look , your challenger calls you out to fight !
1	so idomeneus , famous spearman , stood his ground , he never gave an inch with aeneas charging in , quick to the rescue
1	and now as the armies clashed at one strategic point they slammed their shields together , pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields ' bosses pounded hide-to-hide and the thunder of struggle roared and rocked the earth
1	would he sanction the mingling of their peoples , bless their binding pacts ?
1	down deep they harden fast—they must , so long engrained in the flesh—in strange , uncanny ways
1	and the dead lord patroclus had fed nine dogs at table — he slit the throats of two , threw them onto the pyre and then a dozen brave sons of the proud trojans he hacked to pieces with his bronze
1	and once the god has led you within the fighter 's shelter , achilles will not kill you — he will hold back all the rest : achilles is no madman , no reckless fool , not the one to defy the gods ' commands
1	so pleased , are they , with all the help , the relief i lent them once ?
1	quickly , set before her stranger 's generous fare while i put away my bellows and all my tools
1	he himself , aflame in outlandish reds and purples , shot gortynian shafts from a lycian bow , a bow of gold slung from the priest ’ s shoulders , gold his helmet too , and he ’ d knotted his saffron cape and flaring linen pleats with a tawny golden brooch , his shirt and barbarous leggings stiff with needled braid
1	now out they go , crossing the trench and threading through the dark , heading toward the enemy camp , destined to die but make a bloodbath first
1	so with telamon 's son great ajax then — vaunting trojans and all their far-flung allies kept on stabbing his shield , full center , no letup
1	i would even urge you to fault him any other day
1	a flash of his helmet as hector shot back , impossible man !
1	night and day the gates of shadowy death stand open wide , but to retrace your steps , to climb back to the upper air— there the struggle , there the labor lies
1	but hector dear to zeus had no idea , hector heard nothing of how his men , left of the ships , were torn and mauled in the argives ' rough response
1	but first send pallas home to evander ’ s grieving city , a soldier who never lost heart when the black day swept him off and drowned him in bitter death
1	but odysseus — why , he 's out of the dark ages , one of the old relics — but in green old age , they say
1	and still i could never swear he 's not a god
1	many who battle round king priam 's mighty walls are sons of the deathless gods — you will inspire lethal anger in them all
1	we were all busy then , milling round a spring and offering victims up on the holy altars , full sacrifice to the gods to guarantee success , under a spreading plane tree where the water splashed , glittering in the sun — when a great omen appeared
1	and once offshore of achaea 's vast encampment they eased her in and hauled the black ship high , far up on the sand , and shored her up with timbers
1	but whenever i would set my mind to drag you up , in deadly earnest , i would hoist you all with ease , you and the earth , you and the sea , all together , then loop that golden cable round a horn of olympus , bind it fast and leave the whole world dangling in mid-air — that is how far i tower over the gods , i tower over men
1	the spirit inside you overpowered by anger !
1	surely we ’ ll carry back to our walls these words of yours with grateful hearts , and if fortune points the way , ally you with our king , latinus
1	here ’ s hyllus rushing in with his bloodcurdling rage but turnus rushing to block him whips a spear at his brow that splits his gilded helmet , sticks erect in his brain
1	nothing i said was meant in earnest — trust me , i mean you all the good will in the world
1	such was the fate of priam , his death , his lot on earth , with troy blazing before his eyes , her ramparts down , the monarch who once had ruled in all his glory the many lands of asia , asia ’ s many tribes
1	clear on the right a bird winged past to seal those words , a soaring eagle swooping
1	like ghosts that after our death , they say , will flutter on or dreams that deceive our senses lost in sleep
1	just think what the gods would have heard if we had come to blows , even those beneath the ground who circle cronus
1	now , quick , i will marshal our battle-hungry argives — face the rest of the trojans , test them , fight them down !
1	and orpheus himself , the thracian priest with his long robes , keeps their rhythm strong with his lyre ’ s seven ringing strings , plucking now with his fingers , now with his ivory plectrum
1	but the day of death already hovers near , and we are not to blame but a great god is and the strong force of fate
1	follow me in , please , let me offer you all a guest could want
1	the piled offerings blazed , frankincense , hallowed foods and brimming bowls of oil
1	the king of lofty olympus won ’ t allow it
1	achilles despised him most , odysseus too — he was always abusing both chiefs , but now he went for majestic agamemnon , hollering out , taunting the king with strings of cutting insults
1	think how promachus sleeps at your feet now , beaten down by my spear — with no long wait to pay the price for my brother dead and gone
1	a rout of them strewed their sacred staves on the ground , raked with a cattle prod by lycurgus , murderous fool !
1	sarpedon marshaled the famous allies , placing glaucus next in command with the combat veteran asteropaeus , head and shoulders the best men , sarpedon thought , after himself of course : he outshone the rest
1	a gift to the gods ?
1	now he has come to hate the generation of priam , and now aeneas will rule the men of troy in power — his sons ' sons and the sons born in future years
1	starved for war , aeneas had cased his calves in gold , left and right , and spurning delay , he shakes his glinting spear
1	i am the flowing river that you see , sweeping the banks and cutting across the tilled fields rich and green
1	on foot a lycian too , one agis strode up now but valerus , no poor heir to his fathers ’ battle prowess , hurled him down as thronius fell to salius , salius to nealces , crack marksman with spears and arrows both , blindsiding in front afar
1	in elephenor 's command sailed forty long black ships
1	and the cause of this , this new trojan grief ?
1	seeing paris , hector raked his brother with insults , stinging taunts : what on earth are you doing ?
1	whom to trust to besiege the embattled walls ?
1	suddenly reaching the open sea in gale force , whipping whitecaps under a shrilling killer-squall they raised the good rich soil of troy and struck the pyre and a huge inhuman blaze went howling up the skies
1	achaeans armed in bronze will thrill to his call , they will put up a man to battle shining hector
1	none of his trappings kept off grisly death — down he went , crushed by racing achilles ' hands , destroyed at the ford where battle-hard achilles stripped his gold away
1	the gods in the halls of jove are filled with pity , feeling the futile rage of both great armies , mourning the labors borne by mortal men
1	she set the man ablaze , his shield and helmet flaming with tireless fire like the star that flames at harvest , bathed in the ocean , rising up to outshine all other stars
1	with that he rushes euryalus , sword drawn as nisus terrified , frenzied—no more hiding in shadows , no enduring such anguish any longer—he breaks out : me—here i am , i did it !
1	hera queen of the gods , daughter of giant cronus , launched the work , harnessed the golden-bridled team and hebe quickly rolled the wheels to the chariot , paired wheels with their eight spokes all bronze , and bolted them on at both ends of the iron axle
1	they would call out , scanning the wide sky , father zeus — ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , glory !
1	so there he rose and loosed an enormous cry and off in the distance pallas shrieked out too and drove unearthly panic through the trojans
1	so now no shield , no sword-arm helps the fighter stand up under the onslaught , overpowering salvos battering down on him left and right
1	the men hung on his words and they obeyed at once
1	they cried in alarm and charged toward the ships and the dust went whirling up from under rushing feet as the men jostled back and forth , shouting orders — grapple the ships !
1	defending their city walls , they all burn to be the first to die
1	once more he springs from arpi , that aetolian , diomedes
1	it 's wrong to have such an iron , ruthless heart
1	up they rose and strapped on armor and swung aboard the war-cars , drivers , fighters beside them — and the horse moved out in front , behind came clouds of infantry , men by thousands , and in their midst his comrades bore patroclus
1	why , i could promise to give back helen , yes , and all her treasures with her , all those riches paris once hauled home to troy in the hollow ships — and they were the cause of all our endless fighting — yes , yes , return it all to the sons of atreus now to haul away , and then , at the same time , divide the rest with all the argives , all the city holds , and then i would take an oath for the trojan royal council that we will hide nothing !
1	a dozen picked men could barely shoulder it up , men of such physique as the earth brings forth these days , but he wrenched it up , hands trembling , tried to heave it right at aeneas , turnus stretching to full height , the hero at speed , at peak strength
1	spears at the ready !
1	pity me in my pain
1	and ares bellowed his cry from far across the lines , churning black as a whirlwind , roaring down now from the city 's crest , commanding trojans on and now rushing along the simois banks and scaling sunlight hill
1	the mares of eumelus must have come to grief , somewhere downfield — they led on the way out
1	both let fly at each other , one launching out with a sharp lance , one a shaft from the string — and helenus ' arrow hit atrides right on the chest , on the breastplate 's curve but the arrow sprang away
1	no such pact did lausus seal between you and me that you would spare my life
1	enough that numanus fell to your flying shafts and you ’ ve not paid a price
1	all the troops were dumbstruck , all but the trojan hero—well he knew that sound , his goddess mother ’ s promise—and he calls out : don ’ t ask , my friend , don ’ t ask me , i beg you , what these portents bring
1	and all the while aeneas lands his men by planks from the high sterns
1	there dardanus was born , there iasius
1	but over his body the goddess raised a terrific din , a war for the prize , the huge beast 's head and shaggy hide — curetes locked to the death with brave aetolians
1	athena 's heart leapt high , she charged at aphrodite , overtook her and beat her breasts with clenched fists
1	that seems best to me
1	for neighboring people living in cities near and far , compelled by signs from the great gods on high , will appease your bones , will build you a tomb and pay your tomb due rites and the site will bear the name of palinurus now and always
1	so on they fought like a mass of swirling fire as neleus ' foaming mares bore nestor clear of battle and bore machaon the expert healer too
1	and what 's more , i can see through you , priam — no hiding the fact from me : one of the gods has led you down to achaea 's fast ships
1	there they settled , conferring among themselves till the noble horseman opened with his plan : my friends , is not there one man among us here , so sure of himself , his soldier 's nerve and pluck , he would infiltrate these overreaching trojans ?
1	far off as he is , you will set him up in glory
1	some heat water in cauldrons fired to boiling , bathe and anoint the body chill with death
1	and now — one warrior harnessed burnished armor on his back , magnificent paris , fair-haired helen 's consort
1	hard as the autumn north wind hits a leveled field just drenched in a downpour , quickly dries it off and the farmer is glad and starts to till his soil — so the whole plain was parched and the god of fire devoured all the dead , then blazing in all his glory veered for the river — an inferno — the elms burned , the willows and tamarisks burned and the lotus burned and the galingale and reeds and rushes , all that flourished along the running river 's lush banks and the eels writhed and fish in the whirlpools leapt high , breaking the surface left and right in a sheen of fire , gasping under the master smith hephaestus ' blast and now the river 's strength was burning out , he panted the god 's name : hephaestus — stop !
1	no , deep in my spirit i have known them all , i ’ ve faced them all before
1	and men who settled tricca , rocky ithome terraced high and men who held oechalia , oechalian eurytus ' city : the two sons of asclepius led their units now , both skilled healers , podalirius and machaon
1	the next moment a cry hits his ears , and look , euryalus !
1	but menestheus could not reach them with a shout — the din was deafening , war cries hitting the skies , spears battering shields and helmets ' horsehair crests and the huge gates all bolted shut , but against them there the trojans tensed and heaved , trying to smash them down and force a passage through
1	achilles pointed out the post
1	but all the rest , once they have turned the wheel of time for a thousand years : god calls them forth to the lethe , great armies of souls , their memories blank so that they may revisit the overarching world once more and begin to long to return to bodies yet again
1	no one can rout me — his will against my will — not by force , god knows , and not by a sly maneuver either
1	forced by wanderings , storm-tossed at sea , or prompted by the gods ?
1	but you , i round on you with all my heart
1	why come back here to shore ?
1	no baby boy still in his mother 's belly , not even he escape — all ilium blotted out , no tears for their lives , no markers for their graves !
1	no mean feat to beat him out in a race , for all but our achilles
1	here the good commander aeneas staked an ilex , leaves and all , as a turning-post where crews would know to wheel their ships around and begin the long pull home
1	scanning every opening , tossing his head , this way , that way , grinding his teeth , blazing in rage , three times he circles the whole aventine hill , three times he tries to storm the rocky gates—no use— three times he sinks down in the lowlands , power spent
1	and now as they filed among the mustered guard they found the chief sentries far from sleep — on the alert , all stationed set with weapons
1	but now it was agamemnon lord of the far-flung kingdoms catching up with isus — he stabbed his chest with a spear above the nipple , antiphus he hacked with a sword across the ear and hurled him from his chariot , rushing fast to rip the splendid armor off their bodies
1	they will look left and right — where can they run ?
1	the gods take seats in the mansion , entering there through doors to east and west , and jove starts in : you great gods of the sky , why have you turned against your own resolve ?
1	now his father was backing off , defenseless , weighed down , dragging his enemy ’ s spearshaft trailing from his shield , so the son sprang forward , darting into the moil and just as aeneas rose up , his arm reared for attack , lausus , ducking under the stroke , parried the sword , holding the trojan off while shouting comrades harried aeneas with missiles pelting in from afar till under his son ’ s shield the father could escape
1	once he gained his side hector raked his brother with insults , stinging taunts : paris , appalling paris !
1	don ’ t you recall whose lands you settled here , the men who press around you ?
1	he kept them fixed on the struggling mass forever , the father 's spirit churning , thrashing out the ways , the numberless ways to cause patroclus ' slaughter
1	i have no mind to sit it out in the shelters — what i love is battle !
1	there they lit their fires , each man made his meal
1	look at his hand clasp , look at his good faith now— that man who , they say , carries his fathers ’ gods , who stooped to shoulder his father bent with age !
1	oh i think he will have his troubles to shoulder , plenty of them too , if achilles ever turns away from the heartbreaking anger deep inside him
1	he obeyed the order , turning , trailing away in silence down the shore where the battle lines of breakers crash and drag
1	i go to his side — nothing i do can help him
1	the nurse bustled off with an old crone ’ s zeal
1	no , my sons , never inure yourselves to civil war , never turn your sturdy power against your country ’ s heart
1	backing , helmet flashing , his strong hand hefting a rock from the field , dark , jagged , a ton weight — he hurled it at ajax , struck the gigantic shield , seven oxhides thick , struck right on the jutting boss and the bronze clanged , echoing round and round as ajax hoisting a boulder — far larger — wheeled and heaved it , putting his weight behind it , tremendous force — and the rock crashed home , hector 's shield burst in , hit by a millstone — and hector 's fine knees buckled , flat on his back he went , his shield crushing down on him swept him off his feet
1	this is the last word that fate allows me to say to you
1	not i , i will never go back again
1	now , again , you divine god 's will for the armies , bruit it about , as fact , why the deadly archer multiplies our pains : because i , i refused that glittering price for the young girl chryseis
1	and his good wife will tear her cheeks in grief , his sons are orphans and he , soaking the soil red with his own blood , he rots away himself — more birds than women flocking round his body !
1	we have brought magnificent hector down , that man the trojans glorified in their city like a god !
1	you ’ ll return from the front no less than aeneas in numbers killed and battle honors won !
1	and now the queen , whose trust lay all in you , she ’ s dead by her own hand , terrified , she ’ s fled the light of life
1	go traipsing over the ridge of dindyma , catch the songs on the double pipe you dote on so !
1	true , lord apollo killed the sons with his silver bow and artemis showering arrows killed the daughters
1	what , father , can we suppose that any spirits rise from here to the world above , return once more to the shackles of the body ?
1	then athena , child of zeus whose shield is thunder , letting fall her supple robe at the father 's threshold — rich brocade , stitched with her own hands ' labor — donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning , buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war and over her shoulders slung her shield , all tassels flaring terror — panic mounted high in a crown around it
1	go back to your own rank and file , i tell you !
1	struggling for breath , hector , his helmet flashing , said , i beg you , beg you by your life , your parents — do not let the dogs devour me by the argive ships !
1	soothing sleep went rushing off to the ships at once , running a message to poseidon
1	now there is no one left in the wide realm of troy , no friend to treat me kindly — all the countrymen cringe from me in loathing !
1	if he gets you in his clutches , sets his eyes on you — that savage , treacherous man — he will show no mercy , no respect for your rights !
1	they split them apart , lashed the logs to the mules and their hoofs tore up the earth , dragging them down to level ground through dense brush
1	and who are they who crowd the banks in such a growing throng ?
1	it glides between her robes and her smooth breasts but she feels nothing , no shudder of coils , senses nothing at all as the viper breathes its fire through the frenzied queen
1	in an instant quercens , aquiculus striking in armor , tmarus—daredevil heart—and haemon , son of mars , with all their squadrons routed , turn tail and run or throw their lives down right at the gateway ’ s mouth
1	menelaus just might lead her home again
1	now they are fighting far away from the city , right by your hollow ships !
1	what news do you bring ?
1	there he climbed and there he slept and by his side lay hera the queen , the goddess of the golden throne
1	so long as rivers run to the sea , so long as shadows travel the mountain slopes and the stars range the skies , your honor , your name , your praise will live forever , whatever lands may call me to their shores
1	ours all clatter to ground
1	and none of the men who walk the earth these days could battle with those fighters , none , but they , they took to heart my counsels , marked my words
1	dragging down from the cliffs along a stony trail some roof-beam or a heavy ship timber , slogging on till they nearly burst their hearts with sweat and labor — so they strained to carry off the corpse
1	round their hoofs he looped the golden hobbles never broken , never slipped , so there they would stand , stock-still on the spot to wait their lord 's return and off poseidon strode to achaea 's vast encampment
1	that , i remind you , that among the immortal gods is the strongest , truest sign that i can give
1	and helen spoke to him now , her soft voice welling up : my dear brother , dear to me , bitch that i am , vicious , scheming — horror to freeze the heart !
1	no , no , let every last man of them lick his wounds — a memento at home — pierced by arrow or spear as he vaults aboard his decks
1	no way for him to escape us now , no longer — not even if phoebus the distant deadly archer goes through torments , pleading for hector 's life , groveling over and over before our storming father zeus
1	even patroclus died , a far , far better man than you
1	but mnestheus and his crew , fired by their success , can just about win the day because they think they can
1	you should have feared for your chosen people then
1	here , what ’ s more , in these two towns , their walls razed to the roots , you can see the relics , monuments of the men of old
1	spent as i was , you left me here , anchises , best of fathers , plucked from so many perils , all for nothing
1	thundering zeus has spread his hands above her — her armies have taken heart !
1	one more thing — take it to heart , i tell you — if part of athena 's plan gives me the honor to kill them both , you check our racers here , you lash them fast to our rails then dash for aeneas ' horses — do not forget — drive them out of the trojan lines and into ours
1	should aeneas go through scathing dangers all unscathed— aeneas ?
1	now those very warriors stand at ease , in silence — the fighting 's stopped , they lean against their shields , their long lances stuck in the ground beside them
1	how short you fall of the fighters sired by zeus in the generations long before us !
1	that 's what they need , i tell you — all the achaeans — good sound advice , now our enemies , camping hard against the ships , kindle their watchfires round us by the thousands
1	mixed in with the trojans ?
1	do not let these trojans mow us down in droves !
1	— spare my life !
1	no remedy , no way to cure the damage once it 's done
1	men will make war and peace
1	the rite complete at last , their duty to the goddess performed in full , they gained the land of joy , the fresh green fields , the fortunate groves where the blessed make their homes
1	then he seizes the wand that calls the pallid spirits up from the underworld and ushers others down to the grim dark depths , the wand that lends us sleep or sends it away , that unseals our eyes in death
1	then promise to sacrifice twelve heifers in her shrine , yearlings never broken , if only she will pity troy , the trojan wives and all our helpless children , if only she will hold diomedes back from the holy city — that wild spearman , that invincible headlong terror !
1	how many shields and helmets and corpses of the brave you ’ ll churn beneath your tides , old father tiber !
1	a moment ago they longed to kill each other , longed for heartbreaking , inhuman warfare on the plain
1	but here my comrades left me , forgot me—this monstrous cave of the cyclops—fleeing in terror from its brutal mouth
1	zeus went back to his own halls , and all the gods in full assembly rose from their seats at once to meet the father striding toward them now
1	cacus retches up from his throat dense fumes—unearthly , i tell you—endless waves billowing through his lair , wiping all from sight , and deep into his cave he spews out tides of rolling , smoking darkness , night and fire fused
1	do not you recall the time you drove tydides ' son to spear me through ?
1	you and your eternal suspicions — i can never escape you
1	as the latian columns charge them , charging them come agyllines and trojans streaming up with arcadian ranks decked out in blazoned gear and one lust drives them all : to let the sword decide
1	and seizing the spearshaft powerful agamemnon dragged it toward him , tussling like some lion and wrenching it free from iphidamas ' slack grasp he hacked his neck with a sword and loosed his limbs
1	pity your father , bent with years and grief , cut off from you in your native city ardea far away
1	so certain , are you , the sons of achaea are cowards , poor soldiers , just because you say so ?
1	by chance , one chloreus , sacred to goddess cybebe , once her priest—camilla spied him at long range , gleaming in phrygian gear , spurring a lathered warhorse decked with coat of mail , its brazen scales meshing with gold like feathers stitched
1	these are the solemn honors owed the dead
1	he will fight again — in his own good time — whenever the courage in him flares and a god fires his blood
1	while the trojans tore the war-gear off the bodies argives clambered back in a tangled mass , scrambling back through the sharp stakes and deep pit of the trench , fleeing left and right , forced inside the rampart
1	how lucky they are , aeneas cries , gazing up at the city ’ s heights , their walls are rising now !
1	but now , patroclus , since i will follow you underneath the ground , i shall not bury you , no , not till i drag back here the gear and head of hector , who slaughtered you , my friend , greathearted friend
1	and i made you what you are — strong as the gods , achilles — i loved you from the heart
1	i was just a baby when father left me then , that time an achaean army went to die at thebes
1	mother 's gone as well
1	these trojans who borrow courage , build their trust on the walls they raise , the ditch they dig between us— what a flimsy buffer to shield them all from slaughter !
1	if that man takes my life with his sharp bronze blade , he will strip my gear and haul it back to his ships
1	this one has no steadiness in his spirit , not now , he never will
1	so they had hauled their vessels inland , row on row , while the whole shoreline filled and the bay 's gaping mouth enclosed by the jaws of the two jutting headlands
1	why , ares , i gather , has just received his share
1	daughter of storming zeus , tireless one , athena — how hollow our vow to menelaus that he would sack the mighty walls of troy before he sailed for home — if we let murderous ares rampage on this way
1	but once the two passed down through crowded streets and out into open country , priam 's kin turned back , his sons and in-laws straggling home to troy
1	whatever dangers await you in that one skirmish , turnus , await me too
1	but once the envoys reached atrides ' shelters , comrades leapt to their feet , welcomed them back and clustering round them , lifted golden cups
1	shall i pluck him up , now , while he 's still alive and set him down in the rich green land of lycia , far from the war at troy and all its tears ?
1	they butchered plenty of fat sheep , banquet fare , and shambling crook-horned cattle , droves of pigs , succulent , rich with fat — they singed the bristles , splaying the porkers out across hephaestus ' fire , then wine from the old man 's jars , all we could drink
1	now what god can unfold for me so many terrors ?
1	once allecto saw her first arrows of madness piercing home and latinus ’ plans and his whole house overwhelmed , the grim goddess takes flight on her black wings and heads straight for the walls of bold rutulian turnus
1	in calm weather , up from the gentle swells it lifts a quiet , level face , a favorite haunt of cormorants basking in the sun
1	three times the brilliant achilles gave his great war cry over the trench , three times the trojans and famous allies whirled in panic — and twelve of their finest fighters died then and there , crushed by chariots , impaled on their own spears
1	they have as many hands and lives as we
1	with that , her mind went veering back and forth— what was the quickest way to break off from the light , the life she loathed ?
1	or if fortune , up to her old tricks , denies me rites , pay them when i am gone and honor me with a hollow tomb
1	she says no more and now as the queen falls silent , pallor sweeps her face
1	a mixing-bowl , richly engraved , the proud trophy that thracian cisseus one day gave my father
1	there they wept no less , finding rhamnes bled white and so many captains killed in one great slaughter
1	but oileus ' son , quick ajax killed the most — no one alive could run men down in flight like him once zeus whipped enemy ranks in blinding , panic rout
1	some flex their limbs in the grassy wrestling-rings , contending in sport , they grapple on the golden sands
1	the god of the quakes who grips and pounds the earth has just this moment plunged in his own bright sea , diving away from all my mounting anger
1	i ca not be sure — to spy on our ships or loot the fallen , one of the fighters ' corpses ?
1	gauls swarming the thickets , about to seize the fortress , shielded by shadows , gift of the pitch-dark night
1	out of my wits , i seize my arms—what reason for arms ?
1	he hurled his spear and whizzing in from a distance , winging on , it ricocheted off aeneas ’ shield to hit that hardy fighter antores , yards away , between the flank and groin : antores sent from argos , hercules ’ aide who bound himself to evander , settling down in the king ’ s italian city
1	this was the first day of her death , the first of grief , the cause of it all
1	what humiliation — if hector with that flashing helmet takes our ships !
1	her voice broke but the old king , lost in wonder , cried out , how lucky you are , son of atreus , child of fortune , your destiny so blessed !
1	others are digging trenches before the gates , hauling up on their shoulders stones and pikes
1	discipline fill your hearts , maintain your pride in the eyes of other men !
1	while look at you , wheeling your chariot round the abandoned grassy fields !
1	but there is no earthly need to fill these halls with the talk that flies so bravely from your mouth , safe as you are while the ramparts keep the enemy out and the trenches still don ’ t overflow with blood
1	no , time and again his mother thetis told him this was not to be , she told him alone , in secret
1	all dwell in the heavens , all command the heights
1	not once have my eyes closed shut beneath my lids from the day my son went down beneath your hands
1	our fight 's unfought , untested — we will see who stands his ground , who cuts and runs
1	but come — let 's go to bed , let 's lose ourselves in love !
1	she ’ s fleshed the war in blood , inaugurated the slaughter with a kill and now she leaves hesperia , wheeling round in the heavens to report success to juno—the fury ’ s voice triumphant : look , i ’ ve done your bidding , perfected a work of strife with ghastly war !
1	before he could say the last , the two raced in , leapt to the ground and comrades hugged them warmly , with handclasps all around and words of welcome
1	whatever fortune sends , we master it all by bearing it all , we must !
1	he sails the massive triton , her sea-horn making the blue deep quake , and as she runs on her prow displays a shaggy man to the waist , all dragon to the tail and under the monster ’ s breast , part man , part beast , the foaming swells resound
1	but the pyre of dead patroclus was not burning — and the swift runner achilles thought of what to do
1	now he will make more slaughter , well i know
1	my friend , remember your father 's last commands ?
1	you ’ ve done good work
1	so come , follow my orders
1	seven women i will give him , flawless , skilled in crafts , women of lesbos — the ones i chose , my privilege , that day he captured the lesbos citadel himself : they outclassed the tribes of women in their beauty
1	my father-in-law latinus will retain his armies , my father-in-law , his power , his rightful rule
1	and the men who lived around percote and practios , men who settled sestos , abydos and gleaming arisbe : asius son of hyrtacus led them on , captain of armies , hyrtacus ' offspring asius — hulking , fiery stallions bore him in from arisbe , from the selleis river
1	then dipping up the wine from the mixing bowls , brimming their cups , pouring them on the earth , men said their prayers to the gods who never die
1	now i think you will cringe at the hint of war if you get wind of battle far away
1	for a destiny so great , great walls you must erect and never shrink from the long labor of exile , no , you must leave this home
1	fool , what short-lived memory you must have !
1	there 's not a man alive who can fight the will of zeus , even a man of iron — zeus is so much stronger !
1	but on the armies came as if the whole earth were devoured by wildfire , yes , and the ground thundered under them , deep as it does for zeus who loves the lightning , zeus in all his rage when he lashes the ground around typhoeus in arima , there where they say the monster makes his bed of pain — so the earth thundered under their feet , armies trampling , sweeping through the plain at blazing speed
1	since it is not allowed that latins and trojans join in pacts of peace , and there is no end to your eternal clashes—now , whatever the luck of each man today , and whatever hope he follows , trojan or italian , i make no choice between them
1	a slash of a sword—thymbraeus finished giant osiris , mnestheus kills arcetius , achates hacks epulo down and gyas , ufens
1	bacchus , giver of bliss , and juno , generous juno , bless us now
1	long as our realm still stood , andromache , poor woman , would often go this way , unattended , to hector ’ s parents , taking the boy astyanax by the hand to see grandfather priam
1	i never met the man myself , never saw him , but they say he had no equal
1	they herded cattle out of the city , fat sheep too , quickly , brought on rations of honeyed , mellow wine and bread from the halls , heaped the firewood high and up from the plain the winds swept the smoke , the sweetness and the savor swirling up the skies
1	the call to action had still not reached their ears and the columns were only just now forming , moving out , stallion-breaking trojans and long lines of achaeans
1	so come , let us rescue him from death ourselves , for fear the son of cronus might just tower in rage if achilles kills this man
1	down from the car he would leapt , squaring off , charging in full fury , full face , straight into agamemnon 's spearhead ramming sharp — the rim of the bronze helmet could not hold it , clean through heavy metal and bone the point burst and the brains splattered all inside the casque
1	nor will juno ever fail to harry the trojan race , and all the while , pleading , pressed by need—what tribes , what towns of italy won ’ t you beg for help !
1	the men bear spears and grim pikes into battle , fight with sword-blades ground to a razor edge and sabellian hurling spears
1	when you set out on that deadly mission , couldn ’ t your mother have said some last farewell ?
1	antilochus struck atymnius hard with a whetted spear , the bronze ripping into his flank and clean through — he crashed at his feet
1	to all , to latinus , the father of my bride , i , turnus , second in fighting strength to none of the men who came before me—i devote my life
1	back he strode to his ramparts , back to camp
1	then , once more , trojan troops would have clambered back inside their walls , whipped weak with fear by the argives primed for battle and they , they would have seized enormous glory — yes , defying even the great decree of zeus — by dint of their own power and striking force
1	we muster men for crews
1	and still i lead our lycians into battle
1	their sister , silvia , trained the stag to take the commands she gave with love , wreathed its horns with tender , fresh-cut garlands , curried the wild creature , bathed it in running springs
1	the next throw now — long-enduring odysseus ' turn
1	at last the sun and the wind went down , abandoned us , broken men , our bearings lost
1	transfixed , the men of troy and sicily froze and prayed the gods on high
1	they found him beside his lodge and black hull , seated grimly — and achilles took no joy when he saw the two approaching
1	clearly victory goes to menelaus dear to ares
1	we cast off cables and let the sheets run free , unfurling sail as a southwind bellies out the canvas
1	look , who 's that achaean there , so stark and grand ?
1	whichever contenders trample on this treaty first , spill their brains on the ground as this wine spills — theirs , their children 's too — their enemies rape their wives !
1	first he lunges at aphrodite , stabs her hand at the wrist then charges me — even me — like something superhuman !
1	then my trojans could catch their breath again , reprieved from death — they cringed at you like bleating goats before some lion
1	he ’ d barely worked her free of the ruthless rock with craft and effort , one bank of her oars gone , one in splinters
1	so anchises urges and all are overjoyed to follow his command
1	detached from the ranks , two scouts took up their posts , the eyes of the army waiting to spot a convoy , the enemy 's flocks and crook-horned cattle coming
1	yet the queen delays , lingering in her chamber with carthaginian chiefs expectant at her doors
1	launch athena against him — the queen of plunder , she 's the one — his match , a marvel at bringing ares down in pain
1	at once — and pay us reparations fair and fitting , a price to inspire generations still to come !
1	that said , he drags the old man straight to the altar , quaking , slithering on through slicks of his son ’ s blood , and twisting priam ’ s hair in his left hand , his right hand sweeping forth his sword— a flash of steel—he buries it hilt-deep in the king ’ s flank
1	so when the maids had bathed and anointed the body sleek with olive oil and wrapped it round and round in a braided battle-shirt and handsome battle-cape , then achilles lifted hector up in his own arms and laid him down on a bier , and comrades helped him raise the bier and body onto the sturdy wagon
1	just at dawn she knelt down beside you and grasped your knees and i suspect you bowed your head in assent to her — you granted once and for all to exalt achilles now and slaughter hordes of achaeans pinned against their ships
1	no way to parley with that man — not now — not from behind some oak or rock to whisper , like a boy and a young girl , lovers ' secrets a boy and girl might whisper to each other
1	if that curse of the earth must reach his haven , labor on to landfall— if jove and the fates command and the boundary stone is fixed , still , let him be plagued in war by a nation proud in arms , torn from his borders , wrenched from iulus ’ embrace , let him grovel for help and watch his people die a shameful death !
1	i ’ d little joy , believe me , when hercules came and i sailed the hero over , or theseus , pirithous , sons of gods as they were with their high and mighty power
1	oh old friend , surely your father peleus urged you , that day he sent you out of phthia to agamemnon , amy son , victory is what athena and hera will give , if they so choose
1	what other achaean driver could match your skill at curbing this deathless team or spurring on their fury ?
1	but he does spot three stags roaming the shore , an entire herd behind them grazing down the glens in a long ranked line
1	soon as the monster gorged himself to bursting , buried deep in wine , his neck slumping to one side , spreading his huge hulk across his cave , dead asleep but retching chunks of flesh and wine awash with filth— we prayed to the great gods , drew lots , rushed in a ring around him there and drilled out with a stabbing spike his one enormous eye , lodged deep in his grisly brow , big as a greek shield or apollo ’ s torch , the sun
1	and all the while they worked over menelaus whose cry could marshal armies , on the trojans came , columns armed for assault , and again the argives donned their gear and roused their lust for war
1	the work is mine , imperious juno carried on , but how to begin this pressing matter now and see it through ?
1	if any prayer can persuade you now , look down on us—that ’ s all i ask—if our devotion has earned it , grant us another omen , father , seal this first clear sign
1	achilles blazed , charging , raging to cut him down , loosing savage cries — but phoebus whisked him away , easy work for a god , and wrapped him round in mist
1	and again the olympian father fired up the trojans ramming argives back against their own deep trench
1	then as tarquitus begs him , struggling to keep on begging , all for nothing , aeneas dashes his head to the ground and rolling the man ’ s warm trunk along and looming over him vaunts with all the hatred in his heart : now lie there , you great , frightful man !
1	you remember the last time i rushed to your defense ?
1	that cry — that was hector 's honored mother i heard !
1	so let your heart be swayed by what i say
1	me out of all the daughters of the sea he chose to yoke to a mortal man , peleus , son of aeacus , and i endured his bed , a mortal 's bed , resisting with all my will
1	i ca not take up my spear , ca not hold it steady — no wading into enemy ranks to fight it out
1	look — now it 's achilles , a greater man he disgraces , seizes and keeps his prize , tears her away himself
1	but achilles wo not be missed so sorely , not a bit , if the rest of us can rouse and defend each other
1	he battered oileus down despite the trojan 's rage and the lord of fighters left them lying there , both dead and their chests gleamed like bronze as he stripped them bare
1	and shouting squads of achaeans raced in for the kill , hoping to drag him off and hurling showers of spears but none could stab or strike the lord of armies now
1	charging like two hostile bulls fighting up on sila ’ s woods or taburnus ’ ridges , ramping in mortal combat , both brows bent for attack and the herdsmen back away in fear and the whole herd stands by , hushed , afraid , and the heifers wait and wonder , who will lord it over the forest ?
1	the reason i linger out this life i loathe , aeneas , now pallas is dead and gone , is your right arm that owes , as you well know , the life of turnus to son and father both
1	like the generations of leaves , the lives of mortal men
1	his voice like a shock wave , the god of the earthquake spurred the argive fighters on — battalions forming around the two aeantes , full strength , crack battalions the god of war would never scorn , rearing midst their ranks , nor would pallas athena driver of armies
1	nireus led his three trim ships from syme , nireus the son of aglaea and king charopus , nireus the handsomest man who ever came to troy , of all the achaeans after peleus ' fearless son
1	a woman or idiot boy could wound me so
1	i knew it then , even when zeus defended us with all his might , and i know it now , when he glorifies these trojans — he lifts them high as the blessed deathless gods but ties our hands and lames our fighting spirit
1	a crack of the lash and his driver whipped the team with streaming manes straight for the curved ships , and on they flew , holding nothing back , their heaving chests foaming , bellies pelted with dust , rushing the wounded warlord free and clear of battle
1	i ’ ll steady before your altar a bull with gilded brows , bright white with its head held high as its mother ’ s , butting its horns already , young hoofs kicking sand !
1	you could hear some trojan or achaean pleading , father zeus !
1	half his lance hung there in antilochus ' shield like a charred stake , half dropped to the ground
1	not even heracles fled his death , for all his power , favorite son as he was to father zeus the king
1	a useless , dead weight on the good green earth — i , no man my equal among the bronze-armed achaeans , not in battle , only in wars of words that others win
1	die and be damned for all i care !
1	this , this was their pleasure after all , sealed long ago — zeus and the son of zeus , the distant deadly archer — though often before now they rushed to my defense
1	my right hand , aeneas , never saved your life
1	now kill or be killed !
1	but now , seeing the best of all achaeans fill your ranks , let one whose nerve impels him to fight with me come striding from your lines , a lone champion pitted against prince hector
1	and dear to the gods while we still shared this life — and they cared about you still , i see , even after death
1	but then , when the wrath came sweeping over the man , the same anger that swells the chests of others , for all their care and self-control — then , heart enraged at his own dear mother althaea , meleager kept to his bed beside his wedded wife , cleopatra
1	i must know it all
1	a shudder went shooting through the old man but he told his men to yoke the team at once
1	now , suddenly , battle thrilled them more than the journey home , than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land
1	he halted beside him there and let his message fly : quickly , son of asclepius , king agamemnon calls !
1	the army rose in uproar
1	but the two atridae stayed , and good odysseus , nestor , idomeneus , phoenix the old charioteer , all trying to comfort achilles deep in sorrow
1	others , i have no doubt , will forge the bronze to breathe with suppler lines , draw from the block of marble features quick with life , plead their cases better , chart with their rods the stars that climb the sky and foretell the times they rise
1	deeply shaken , the god who rocks the earth replied , hera , what wild words !
1	setting his fears aside , he starts out on his story : i come from ithaca , my country
1	she reared before you , skewed the tearing shaft , flicking it off your skin as quick as a mother flicks a fly from her baby sleeping softly
1	and now holding that great shield before his chest telamonian ajax marched right up to hector , threatening with his deep resounding voice , hector , now you will learn , once and for all , in combat man-to-man , what kind of champions range the argive ranks , even besides achilles , that lionheart who mauls battalions wholesale
1	even the seer tolumnius falls , the first to wing a lance against the foe
1	when an old man 's killed and the dogs go at the gray head and the gray beard and mutilate the genitals — that is the crudest sight in all our wretched lives !
1	hera broke into smiles now , her eyes wide — with a smile she tucked the band between her breasts
1	that high and mighty king agamemnon , that son of atreus !
1	i know i can overpower this dazzling hector
1	jove himself lifts up his scales , balanced , trued , and in them he sets the opposing fates of both
1	if only we , we gods who defend the argives had the will to hurl the trojans back and hold off thundering zeus — there he would sit and smolder , throned in desolate splendor up on ida
1	just one more , my generous king !
1	under podarces sailed their forty long black ships
1	why such concern for enemies ?
1	or are we all fools , father , to dread the bolts you hurl ?
1	there in the entryway , the gorge of hell itself , grief and the pangs of conscience make their beds , and fatal pale disease lives there , and bleak old age , dread and hunger , seductress to crime , and grinding poverty , all , terrible shapes to see—and death and deadly struggle and sleep , twin brother of death , and twisted , wicked joys and facing them at the threshold , war , rife with death , and the furies ’ iron chambers , and mad , raging strife whose blood-stained headbands knot her snaky locks
1	he charged acamas — acamas could not stand the attack , he ran — and peneleos stabbed at ilioneus instead , a son of the herdsman phorbas rich in flocks , hermes ' favorite trojan : hermes gave him wealth but ilioneus ' mother gave him just one son
1	as the word spread , the ranks were struck dumb and icy fear sent shivers down their spines
1	at once she called to turnus ’ sister , goddess to goddess , the lady of lakes and rilling brooks , an honor the high and mighty king of heaven bestowed on juturna once he had ravished the virgin girl : nymph , beauty of streams , our heart ’ s desire , well you know how i have favored you , you above all the italian women who have mounted that ungrateful bed of our warm-hearted jove— i gladly assigned you a special place in heaven
1	and moving off to a safe distance , over and over the old priest prayed to the son of sleek-haired leto , lord apollo , hear me , apollo !
1	and then no way to escape my death , my certain doom — achilles is far too strong for any man on earth
1	iris quick as the breezes tried to soothe him : wait , god of the sea-blue mane who grips the earth — you really want me to take that harsh , unbending answer back to zeus ?
1	from that day on i have known of troy ’ s disaster , known your name , and all the kings of greece
1	command poseidon to quit the war and slaughter now , go back to the tribes of gods or down to his bright sea
1	but you hang back of your own accord , refuse to fight
1	if fate has saved that man , if he still draws strength from the air we breathe , if he ’ s not laid low , not yet with the heartless shades , fear not , nor will you once regret the first step you take to compete with him in kindness
1	you think that thundering zeus , shielding the men of troy , will rage as he raged for great heracles , his own son ?
1	so he vaunted , rearing against achilles , seething , heaving up in fury , thundering out now in foam and blood and corpses — the bloodred crest of the river swelled by zeus came arching higher , ready to tear pelides down but hera , struck with fear for achilles , screamed out , dreading he might be swept away by the giant churning river and quickly cried to the god of fire , her own dear son , to arms , my child — god of the crooked legs !
1	why does he shut his pitiless ears to my appeals ?
1	some cut it into quivering strips , impale it on skewers , some set cauldrons along the beach and fire them to the boil
1	all the rest they burn , unnumbered and unsung , an enormous tangled mass of bloody carnage waits and the wasteland far and wide lights up with fires , with pyre on pyre striving to outblaze the last
1	by this , this scepter , look , that never again will put forth crown and branches , now it 's left its stump on the mountain ridge forever , nor will it sprout new green again , now the brazen ax has stripped its bark and leaves , and now the sons of achaea pass it back and forth as they hand their judgments down , upholding the honored customs whenever zeus commands — this scepter will be the mighty force behind my oath : someday , i swear , a yearning for achilles will strike achaea 's sons and all your armies !
1	here at the first assault the trojans shouldered back the fiery-eyed achaeans — a myrmidon had been hit , and not their least man , dauntless agacles ' son , renowned epigeus
1	now like a wolfpack out for blood on a foggy night , driven blindly on by relentless , rabid hunger , leaving cubs behind , waiting , jaws parched— so through spears , through enemy ranks we plow to certain death , striking into the city ’ s heart , the shielding wings of the darkness beating round us
1	the ships are ablaze
1	bend to the oars !
1	wake quick little ajax , meges too
1	you know his rage yourself
1	on he fought like a whirlwind , staunch as always — think of the hounds and huntsmen circling round some lion or boar when the quarry wheels at bay , rippling in strength as the men mass like a bastion standing up to his charge and hurl their pelting spears and the boar 's brave spirit never flinches , never bolts and his own raw courage kills him — time and again he wheels around , testing the huntsmen 's ranks and where he lunges out the ranks of men give way
1	picture an ocean rolling , waves ebbing and flowing , now flooding onto the shore , smashing over the cliffs in a burst of foam and drenching the bay ’ s sandy edge— now rushing in fast retreat , swallowing down the scree lost in the backwash , leaving the shallows high and dry : so twice the etruscans hurled the latins toward their walls , twice routed , glancing round they cover their backs with shields
1	as lavinia heard her mother ’ s pleas , her warm cheeks bathed in tears , a blush flamed up and infused her glowing features
1	so the clash of achaean and trojan troops was on its own , the battle in all its fury veering back and forth , careering down the plain as they sent their bronze lances hurtling side-to-side between the simois ' banks and xanthus ' swirling rapids
1	quickly he poured a mist across achilles ' eyes , wrenched the spear from stalwart aeneas ' shield , laid the bronze-shod ashen shaft at achilles ' feet and hoisting aeneas off the earth he slung him far
1	he flared up and the swift runner achilles smiled , delighting in antilochus — he liked the man immensely
1	the more we have got , the better the work will go !
1	and helen the radiance of women answered priam , i revere you so , dear father , dread you too — if only death had pleased me then , grim death , that day i followed your son to troy , forsaking my marriage bed , my kinsmen and my child , my favorite , now full-grown , and the lovely comradeship of women my own age
1	whirling he stabbed dryops , speared him right through the neck — he dropped at his feet and achilles left him dead and smashed demuchus ' knee , philetor 's strapping son , stopped him right in his tracks with a well-flung spear then sprang with his great sword and ripped his life away
1	the goddess led the way
1	and first by far was oileus ' son , quick little ajax — he lunged out and his spearhead skewered satnius , enops ' son the lithe nymph of the ford once bore to enops tending his flocks by satniois ' banks
1	war cries rising , everywhere , on and on they charge , packing the trench with earth , some men hurling fiery torches onto the rooftops
1	and at his side , his son , ascanius , second hope of rome ’ s imposing power , while a priest in pure white robes leads on the young of a bristly boar and an unshorn yearling sheep toward the flaming altars
1	so the cretan yelled and all his comrades came in a pack with one will , massing round him , bracing shields to shoulders
1	idomeneus skewered erymas straight through the mouth , the merciless brazen spearpoint raking through , up under the brain to split his glistening skull — teeth shattered out , both eyes brimmed to the lids with a gush of blood and both nostrils spurting , mouth gaping , blowing convulsive sprays of blood and death 's dark cloud closed down around his corpse
1	next agamemnon ’ s man who hated the very name of troy—halaesus , yoking his team to a chariot , speeds along a thousand diehard clans in turnus ’ cause
1	let them sing of such an alliance , such a wedding hymn , the matchless son of venus and that grand king latinus !
1	let me spill his corpse on the ground and strip his breastplate , rip it to bits with my bare hands—that phrygian eunuch— defile his hair in the dust , his tresses crimped with a white-hot curling-iron dripping myrrh !
1	so the missiles showering from their hands — achaeans , trojans , helmets and bossed shields clashing , ringing shrilly under the blows of boulders big as millstones
1	the argives ' work was finished
1	and he hurled his sharp spear from a strong hand — a hard true hit on achilles ' shin below the knee !
1	a loathsome ooze discharges from their bellies , talons for hands , their jaws deathly white with a hunger never sated
1	but still euryalus glowed with a killer ’ s stealth , he was stalking nearer messapus ’ henchmen now , he could spot the outer campfires flickering low and horses tethered securely , grazing grass—the cavalry— when nisus , sensing his comrade run amok with bloodlust , cuts him short : call it quits , the dawn ’ s at hand , our old foe
1	for a while now a craving ’ s urged me on to swing into action , some great exploit— no peace and quiet for me
1	so , at our wit ’ s end , we send eurypylus off to question apollo ’ s oracle now , and back he comes from the god ’ s shrine with these bleak words : with blood you appeased the winds , with a virgin ’ s sacrifice when you , you greeks , first sought the shores of troy
1	so i am going — her message must not come to nothing
1	every one of us knows the ropes in war
1	he sealed himself in his house and dropped the reins of power
1	medon the bastard son of royal king oileus , little ajax ' brother , but medon lived in phylace , banished from native land — he would killed a kinsman dear to oileus ' wife , his stepmother eriopis — but iphiclus son of phylacus bore podarces
1	one can achieve his fill of all good things , even of sleep , even of making love
1	now off you go , move on , wherever the path leads you , steer your steps
1	avoid his grasp , he warns
1	here is the queen , with a grand cortege of ladies bearing gifts and riding up to minerva ’ s temple , set on the heights , and beside her rides the girl , the princess lavinia , cause of all their grief , her lovely eyes bent low
1	bury me , quickly — let me pass the gates of hades
1	and following in his wake sails irresistible astyr , astyr who trusts to his horse and armor rainbow-hued
1	now she stalks the bones , the ashes of murdered troy !
1	now some gear up to cross the plains on foot , some , riding high on their horses , wildly churn the dust and all shout out to arms ! —polishing shields smooth , burnishing lances bright with thick rich grease , honing their axes keen on grindstones
1	with a god 's help i just might rouse him now , bring his fighting spirit round at last
1	now not a single lycian goes to fight the argives , not to save your troy
1	but aeneas it was whom phoebus , urger of armies , filled with power now and drove against achilles
1	never has longing for you overwhelmed me so , no , not even then , i tell you , that first time when i swept you up from the lovely hills of lacedaemon , sailed you off and away in the racing deep-sea ships and we went and locked in love on rocky island
1	i shake off sleep and scrambling up to the pitched roof i stand there , ears alert , and i hear a roar like fire assaulting a wheatfield , whipped by a southwind ’ s fury , or mountain torrent in full spate , flattening crops , leveling all the happy , thriving labor of oxen , dragging whole trees headlong down in its wake— and a shepherd perched on a sheer rock outcrop hears the roar , lost in amazement , struck dumb
1	who was the first trojan the marksman teucer hit ?
1	rushing to block them , corynaeus grabs a flaming torch from the altar—just so ebysus can ’ t strike first—and hurls fire in the latin ’ s face and his huge beard flares up , reeking with burnt singe
1	as he groaned from the depths his mother rose before him and sobbing a sharp cry , cradled her son 's head in her hands and her words were all compassion , winging pity : my child — why in tears ?
1	never give up your lust for war against these argives !
1	like a stubborn ass some boys lead down a road
1	troy ’ s up in flames , the rest are looting , sacking the city heights
1	where pallas rifles his spear full force and sweeps his flashing sword from its casing sheath
1	and again i rush to arms , desperate to die myself
1	the queen— when from her house she sees the enemy coming strong , walls assaulted , flames surging up to the roofs and no rutulian force in sight to block their way , no troops of turnus , then , poor woman , she thinks him killed in the press of war and suddenly lost in the frenzied grip of sorrow , claims that she ’ s the cause , the criminal , source of disaster— shrilling wild words in her crazed , grieving fit and bent on death , ripping her purple gown for a noose , she knots it high to a rafter , dies a gruesome death
1	but from the moment that godless diomedes , flanked by ulysses , the mastermind of crime , attacked and tore the fateful image of pallas out of her own hallowed shrine , and cut down the sentries ringing your city heights and seized that holy image and even dared touch the sacred bands on the virgin goddess ’ head with hands reeking blood— from that hour on , the high hopes of the greeks had trickled away like a slow , ebbing tide
1	the archers gather now , cast lots in a bronze helmet , and first to leap out , to partisan shouts , is hippocoön , son of hyrtacus
1	three times i fled around the great city of priam — i lacked courage then to stand your onslaught
1	now for mastery , all your skill !
1	then in an avid stream the mothers and unarmed crowds and frail old men find seats on towers and rooftops , others take their stand on the high gates
1	with that he slipped his tunic over his chest , under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals , pinned with a brooch his crimson cape around him , flowing in double folds and topped with thick fleece , and gripping a tough spear tipped with a brazen point , he strode along the ships of the argives armed in bronze
1	he gouged her just where the wristbone joins the palm and immortal blood came flowing quickly from the goddess , the ichor that courses through their veins , the blessed gods — they eat no bread , they drink no shining wine , and so the gods are bloodless , so we call them deathless
1	he ca not escape , i tell you , not this wrenching battle
1	relent , achilles — you too !
1	trojan and latin war cries set the sky on fire as aeneas dashes up and wrenching his sword from its sheath , he triumphs over him : where ’ s the fierce mezentius now ?
1	teucer took the challenge , rushed to his side and reflex bow in hand and quiver bristling shafts he loosed a splattering burst against the trojans
1	and in his command sailed fifty long black ships
1	you gods of my fathers , now i follow wherever you lead me , i am with you
1	plunging on he goes , overtaking their finest , turnus ’ front-line troops : antaeus , lucas and stalwart numa and camers with tawny locks , magnanimous volcens ’ son , the richest landholder in all italy once , the lord of amyclae , quiet town
1	we launch out on the foaming waves as wind and helmsman call our course
1	and soon as the men had prayed and flung the barley , first they lifted back the heads of the victims , slit their throats , skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat , a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh
1	the man received it gladly
1	i had hoped by now , once we destroyed them all — all the achaeans and all their hollow ships — we might turn home to the windy heights of troy
1	so , couldn ’ t they stay defeated in defeat ?
1	soon as he saw our dardan dress from afar , our trojan swords , he froze in his tracks a moment , gripped by fear , then breakneck made for the shore with tears and prayers : i beg you , trojans , beg by the stars , the gods above , the clear bright air we breathe—sail me off and away !
1	and soon leucata ’ s cloudy summit comes into view and apollo ’ s shrine on its rugged headland , dread of sailors
1	the great debate had closed
1	with a god 's help you just might rouse him now , bring his fighting spirit round at last
1	so the men can see , that instant , your black blood gush and spurt around my spear !
1	neither the land of troy could hold her back , setting sail with me , nor king acestes ’ city
1	he refused to let his two boys march to war , this man-killing war , but the young ones fought him all the way — the forces of black death drove them on
1	then patron flanked by salius , an acarnanian , one , and one an arcadian born of tegean blood
1	but proetus plotted against him
1	and with each cry he thrust his slashing pike with a fresh new fury
1	if only i ’ d joined ranks with our trojan comrades here and latin spears had hurled me down !
1	no one — but at least he hears you are still alive and his old heart rejoices , hopes rising , day by day , to see his beloved son come sailing home from troy
1	sped by his four-horse chariot , flaunting torches , right through the greek tribes and elis city ’ s heart he rode in triumph , claiming as his the honors of the gods
1	so return the girl to the god , at least for now
1	not for the argives
1	what prevents us from building walls right here , presenting our citizens with a city ?
1	we ’ re never again to see the rivers hector loved , the simois and the xanthus ?
1	and the guide and giant-killer answered staunchly , you are testing me , old man — asking of noble hector
1	there i saw the twin sons of aloeus too , giant bodies that clawed the soaring sky with their hands to tear it down and thrust great jove from his kingdom high above
1	you would eat your fill , i would hold the cup to your lips and all too often you soaked the shirt on my chest , spitting up some wine , a baby 's way
1	i would be shattered — what could i do to save you ?
1	the tracks in his wake , his stride as he sped away — i know him at once , with ease — no mistaking the gods
1	the almighty father answered , three times over , rending the cloudless sky with claps of thunder , flourishing high in his own hand from heaven ’ s peak a cloud on fire with rays of gold , with radiance
1	but if i should take on hector and hector 's trojans alone , in single combat — trying to save my pride — wo not they encircle me , one against so many ?
1	and i would be ashamed to pour a glistening cup to zeus with unwashed hands
1	from there the entire ida ridge swung clear in view , the city of priam clear and the warships of achaea
1	but now , look , he gives you a trove of treasures right away , and vows there are more to follow
1	taking a man 's shape , the cicones ' captain mentes , apollo spurred him on with winged orders : hector — you are chasing the wild wind , fiery achilles ' team !
1	but if he will not surrender her , i will go myself , i will seize her myself , with an army at my back — and all the worse for him !
1	and out like a flashing snowcapped peak he moved , shouting , sweeping on through his ranks and trojan allies
1	next he brings down amycus , gifted killer of wild game— no hand more skilled at dipping an arrow ’ s point or capping a lance with poison—then clytius , aeolus ’ son , then cretheus , friend of the muses , the muses ’ comrade , cretheus , always dear to his heart the song and lyre , tuning a verse to the taut string , always singing of cavalry , weapons , wars and the men who fight them
1	sit in front of me , so you can see your husband of long ago , your kinsmen and your people
1	on his mother ’ s side , well born , but his father ’ s side remains a blank
1	so wild the man 's fury he will never rest content , holding out on the plain where trojans and argives met halfway , exchanging blows in the savage onset — never : he will fight for our wives , for troy itself !
1	once in the past he came our way , king odysseus heading the embassy they sent for your release , together with menelaus dear to ares
1	father zeus , i swear , will never defend the trojans , liars — they were the first to trample on their oaths
1	look , i have lifted the mist from off your eyes that 's blurred them up to now — so you can tell a god from man on sight
1	so bloated with all your empty pride , pulling your slippery inbred tricks for nothing !
1	so with you and me
1	while all the rest of us , every god on olympus bows down to you , each of us overpowered
1	his breastplate could not save him , the bronze he always wore , and the shaft pierced his bowels
1	at last she comes , with a great retinue crowding round the queen who wears a tyrian cloak with rich embroidered fringe
1	cries go up , squadrons form , galloping hoofbeats drum the rutted plain with thunder
1	she screamed and her scream rang out through all troy : come , look down , you men of troy , you trojan women !
1	i rank her higher than clytemnestra , my wedded wife — she 's nothing less in build or breeding , in mind or works of hand
1	but kind diana hides the man away in a secret haunt , sends him off to egeria , deep in the nymph ’ s grove where , alone in italian woods and all unsung— virbius , his new name—he might live out his time
1	let him know he 's loved by the greatest gods on high while the gods who up till now have shielded troy from war and death are worthless as the wind !
1	quick , call to the chiefs — if one can hear you now
1	it ’ s clear , aeneas comes by the will of fate , the word on high
1	and now as the powers wrangled back and forth the lord god apollo entered holy troy , filled with dread for the city 's sturdy walls : what if the argive forces stormed them down today — against the will of fate ?
1	make your plans together
1	there — at a dead run meriones ran down acamas , acamas mounting behind his team , and gouged his right shoulder — he pitched from the car and the mist whirled down his eyes
1	brave hearts in war , our tempers steeled , our armies proved in action
1	so he triumphed and again he was bent on outrage , on shaming noble hector — he flung him facedown in the dust beside patroclus ' bier
1	past his strength no man can go , though he 's set on mortal combat
1	dog that he is , he would never dare to look me straight in the eyes again
1	so imbrius fell , the fine bronze armor clashing against him hard
1	— what help is he to you ?
1	a cry hits the skies , all the latins turning to watch as tarchon flies like wildfire down the field , bearing the man and weapons both , then wrenches off the iron point of venulus ’ spear and delves around for a spot laid bare where a lethal blow might land , the other fighting off the enemy ’ s hand from his throat , pitting force against fury
1	funeral games for anchises all the while aeneas , steeled for a mid-sea passage , held the fleet on course , well on their way now , plowing the waves blown dark by a northwind as he glanced back at the walls of carthage set aglow by the fires of tragic dido ’ s pyre
1	doomed to a short life , you have so little time
1	be good to me now , you shades of the dead below , for the gods above have turned away their favors
1	i was born in troy , and the blood you see is oozing from no tree
1	leave the deep sea to the rest !
1	flanked by his son , pallas , the ranking men and the lowly senate , all were offering incense now , and warm blood was steaming on the altars
1	he hurled — his spear 's long shadow flew and it struck ajax ' shield , that awesome seven-layered buckler , right on the eighth , the outside layer of bronze that topped it off , through six hides it tore but the seventh stopped the relentless brazen point
1	at the same time the wrenching news hits turnus still in the woods
1	but now , i say , let us give way to the dark night , set out the evening meal
1	here a freer air , a dazzling radiance clothes the fields and the spirits possess their own sun , their own stars
1	now , the decii and the drusi—look over there—torquatus too , with his savage axe , camillus bringing home the standards
1	how fortunate , both at once !
1	now you will never live to see our kingdom born , never ride in triumph home to your father ’ s house
1	the king , bent with years , kept his comrades , aeneas and his son , beside him , moving on as he eased the way with many stories
1	there 's a dead tree-stump standing six feet high , it 's oak or pine , not rotted through by the rains , and it 's propped by two white stones on either side
1	but if i snuff your life out in my hands , you will never annoy our argive lines again
1	no , my dearest husband , i ’ d never put you to work in a lost cause , much as i owed to priam ’ s sons , however often i wept for aeneas ’ grueling labors
1	now strife hurled down the leveler hate amidst both sides , wading into the onslaught , flooding men with pain
1	down on the ground he dashed the scepter studded bright with golden nails , then took his seat again
1	why , you could be my son , my youngest-born at that , though you urge our kings with cool clear sense : what you have said is right
1	this achilles — he will reap the rewards of that great courage of his alone , i tell you — weep his heart out far too late , when our troops are dead and gone
1	trail the field out but pass them all at the post , no one can catch you then or overtake you with a surge — not if the man behind you were driving huge arion , adrastus ' lightning stallion sired by the gods , or laomedon 's team , the greatest bred in troy
1	if you think all greeks are one , if hearing the name greek is enough for you , it ’ s high time you made me pay the price
1	the rest fought on with deafening war cries rising
1	all atremble , he carries on with his tale , lying from the cockles of his heart : time and again the greeks had yearned to abandon troy—bone-tired from a long hard war—to put it far behind and beat a clean retreat
1	take my commands through the racing winds and tell him this is not the man his mother , the lovely goddess , promised , not for this did she save him twice from greek attacks
1	that breathed tremendous strength in the famous captain
1	but his father hears their wails far off and stirred by a grim foreboding , knows it all
1	just as early , aeneas is stirring too
1	and the two aeantes ranged all points of the rampart , calling out commands to spur their comrades ' fury
1	then for the runner-up he brought forth a mare , unbroken , six years old , with a mule foal in her womb
1	despite all that , the flames , the implacable fire never quits its fury
1	what is left at the last ?
1	not you — you are the one who knows me best , i would say
1	but his wailing failed to move the heart of zeus : it was zeus 's pleasure to hand the prize to hector
1	so , force me , will he , to wrench my will to his ?
1	this message mighty juno in person ordered me to give you here , asleep in the dead of night
1	he sprang to his feet , calling down to cohorts , friends — lords of the argives , o my captains — am i the only one who can spot that pair or can you see them too ?
1	— son of peleus , you a mortal and i a deathless god
1	she thrives on speed , stronger for every stride , slight with fear at first , soon soaring into the air she treads the ground and hides her head in the clouds
1	i am a myrmidon , and my father is polyctor , and a wealthy man he is , about as old as you
1	when would some other argive unit make its charge , engage the trojan front and open up in battle ?
1	only if you could breach their gates and their long walls and devour priam and priam 's sons and the trojan armies raw — then you just might cure your rage at last
1	and all his clothes and crowning it all , the bridal bed that brought my doom
1	armor must be forged for a man of courage !
1	but meriones caught him in full retreat , he let fly with a bronze-tipped arrow , hitting his right buttock up under the pelvic bone so the lance pierced the bladder
1	you , turnus , the guilt is yours , and a dreadful end awaits you— you will implore the gods with prayers that come too late !
1	here in my own land she founded her paltry city for a pittance
1	plead with my imperious enemy
1	helenus charged deipyrus , cleft the side of his head with a massive thracian sword , smashed his helmet and knocked it off
1	they hauled their chariots up in ranks , at rest , the troops dismounted and stripped away their arms and laid them down on the earth , crowded together — hardly a foot of plowland showed between them
1	three times patroclus charged the jut of the high wall , three times apollo battered the man and hurled him back , the god 's immortal hands beating down on the gleaming shield
1	i too can trace my birth from jove on high
1	better to waste time , skirting sicily then in a long arc rounding cape pachynus , than once set eyes on gruesome scylla deep in her cave , her rocks booming with all her sea-green hounds
1	aeneas was first — he aimed and hurled at idomeneus but the cretan saw it coming , dodged the brazen tip and aeneas ' lance plunged in the earth , quivering , his arm 's power poured in a wasted shot
1	follow me , fight for alcathous , your brother-in-law who reared you at home when you were just a boy
1	lay it away as a treasure
1	as he bent to the work with all his craft and cunning , thetis on her glistening feet drew near the smith
1	then at last , screeching out on their grinding hinge the infernal gates swing wide
1	else he will spear you down or close for the kill and hack you with his sword
1	he swore his mighty oath — blinded , from that hour on
1	it 's well to lift our hands and ask great zeus for mercy
1	just as we grew up together in your house , after menoetius brought me there from opois , and only a boy , but banished for bloody murder the day i killed amphidamas ' son
1	wait , take the princely ransom of bronze and gold , the gifts my father and noble mother will give you — but give my body to friends to carry home again , so trojan men and trojan women can do me honor with fitting rites of fire once i am dead
1	there 's powerful diomedes brought down by an archer , odysseus wounded , and agamemnon too , the famous spearman , and eurypylus took a shaft in the thigh , and here , machaon — i just brought him in from the fighting , struck down by an arrow whizzing off the string
1	why , it 's as if they had caught you in public , doing something wrong
1	come , let us stand our ground together — beat him back
1	some are turned away from the banks and others scull the murky waters with their oars !
1	and so we give polydorus a fresh new burial , piling masses of earth on his first mound , raising to all the shades below an altar dark with the wreaths of grief and dead-black cypress ringed by trojan women , hair unbound in mourning
1	but the swift runner achilles answered firmly , phoenix , old father , bred and loved by the gods , what do i need with honor such as that ?
1	the winds swerved from the north and drove them safe to port
1	all of us right behind you , hearts intent on battle
1	shaft on shaft , no stopping him till he stretches seven hefty carcasses on the ground—a triumph , one for each of his ships—and makes for the cove , divides the kill with his whole crew and then shares out the wine that good acestes , princely man , had brimmed in their casks the day they left sicilian shores
1	— that made you famous once , both among outland men and those you rule in troy !
1	the bloody arm dropped to the earth , and red death came plunging down his eyes , and the strong force of fate
1	so now , for the night , we guard our own positions , but tomorrow at daybreak , armed to the hilt for battle , waken slashing war against their hollow hulls
1	he whistled shrill , his signal to rugged diomedes pausing , deep in thought
1	nor did the god of earthquakes fail to hear the goddess
1	all stand in the forecourt , and all the other kings from the start of time , and those who had taken wounds in war , fighting to save their country
1	time and again she placed herself on a par with their own mother , leto in her immortal beauty — how she insulted leto : 'all you have borne is two , but i have borne so many !
1	cowards , i know , would quit the fighting now but the man who wants to make his mark in war must stand his ground and brace for all he 's worth — suffer his wounds or wound his man to death
1	and atreus ' son drew forth the dagger always slung at his battle-sword 's big sheath , he cut some hairs from the boar 's head , first tufts to start the rite , and lifting up his arms to zeus on high he prayed while the armies held fast to their seats in silence , all by rank and file , listening to their king
1	too many kings can ruin an army — mob rule !
1	musing over the shifting tides of war as pallas flanks him closely on his left , asking now of the stars that guide them through the night and now of the hardships he had braved on land and sea
1	now in came envoys sent from the latin city , bearing olive branches and pleading for a truce
1	tell him about my vicious work , how neoptolemus degrades his father ’ s name—don ’ t you forget
1	there is a valley full of twists and turns , a perfect spot for the lures and subterfuge of battle , both of its sides closed off and dark with thick brush
1	the trojan son of anchises , stunned with awe , his spirits lift with the sign and scanning the skies above his head aeneas prays a few strong words : ida ’ s generous queen and mother of the gods , by dindyma dear to your heart , by towered cities , the double team of lions yoked to your reins , lead me in war , bring on the omen , goddess , speed the trojans home with your victor ’ s stride !
1	he dies fighting for fatherland — no dishonor there !
1	breathing room in war is all too brief
1	but ajax did stab home at the shield 's jutting bulge , beating hector back with enormous driving force and he gave ground , back and away from both corpses as argives hauled them from the fighting by the heels
1	send such a rout of first-rate fighters down to death and never pay the price ?
1	stinging taunts inflame the will of the fighters all the more till a low growing murmur steals along the lines
1	why thrash things out ?
1	meriones back on attack — a savage swoop like a vulture — yanked the spear from the trojan 's shoulder joint and back he drew into crowds of waiting troops
1	book four : the truce erupts in war
1	now shield against oxhide shield , wedging tight , with a wild rush they charged the argives head-on , never thinking the argive line could still hold out — they would all be hurled back on their blackened hulls
1	with those words , drawing him toward her there , she made a place for the old man beside the holy shrine
1	achilles led them now in a throbbing chant of sorrow , laying his man-killing hands on his great friend 's chest : farewell , patroclus , even there in the house of death !
1	glare of the fires lit my view as i looked down , scanning the city left and right , and there she was
1	but the argives rose in grief to avenge that boast — skilled peneleos most of all , anger blazed inside him
1	or if you prefer , hold off a moment now
1	bring him on , i say !
1	so homeward bound , your ships and hardy shipmates anchor in port now or approach the harbor ’ s mouth , full sail ahead
1	all as one the armies cried out in sorrow , and achilles led the chant
1	now i can only tell the lords of the ships , the ships in all their numbers !
1	how could he know what work the father had in mind ?
1	spreading both arms wide
1	let this be part of our peace , to grasp your leader ’ s hand
1	leave me alone , have done — captain of armies , i am filled with horror !
1	hector 's holding council with all his chiefs , mapping plans on old king ilus ' barrow , clear of the crowds at camp
1	look , like wasps quick and pinched at the waist or bees who build their hives on a rocky path , they never give up their hollow house , they hold on , keep the honey-hunters at bay , fight for their young
1	think , since you fired our comrades ' fury against the ships , from that hour we have held our ground right here , taking the argives on , and nonstop , no rest
1	but hera and great athena were looking on and with mocking words began to provoke the father , athena leading off with taunts , her eyes bright : father zeus , i wonder if you would fume at me if i ventured a bold guess ?
1	don ’ t pray to me now
1	i broke all bonds , i tore the promised bride from her waiting groom , i brandished a wicked sword
1	no one 's picked to defend the army
1	but , oh , how tossed he ’ s been by the blows of fate
1	you — it 's your duty to stand in the front ranks and take your share of the scorching blaze of battle
1	he lacks the sense to see a day behind , a day ahead , and safeguard the achaeans battling by the ships
1	a woman matched with a god , with hercules , hero of tiryns come to the latin land in glory , fresh from cutting the monster geryon down , to wash the herds of spain in the tiber river
1	but apollo quickly pulled him up — and now they would have closed with swords , hacked each other if heralds of zeus and men had not come rushing in , one from the trojans , one from the armed achaeans , talthybius and idaeus , both with good clear heads
1	he smashes thoas full in the face with a rock and crushes out his skull in a spray of brains and blood
1	this warrior girl , with her young hands untrained for minerva ’ s spools and baskets filled with wool , a virgin seasoned to bear the rough work of battle , swift to outrace the winds with her lightning pace
1	war — i know it well , and the butchery of men
1	stalking along the ships , alone through camp in the very dead of night when other mortals try to catch some sleep
1	suddenly , right before their eyes , look , a potent marvel destined to shape the future !
1	but you , who are you ?
1	so , conversing and drawing near evander ’ s humble home , they saw herds of cattle , everywhere , lowing loud in the roman forum and carinae ’ s elegant district
1	joining forces with them , the trojan escorts mass to form a growing column of mourners on the march
1	broad as the door of a rich man 's vaulted treasure-chamber , well-fitted with sturdy bars , so broad each wing of the bird spread out on either side as it swept in through the city flashing clear on the right before the king and queen
1	hippothous and pylaeus , tested soldier , led them on , both sons of pelasgian lethus , teutamus ' scion
1	tell me the whole truth
1	hair loose in the wind , the priestess thunders out the names of her three hundred gods , erebus , chaos and triple hecate , diana the three-faced virgin
1	book twenty-three : funeral games for patroclus
1	never so swift the teams in a two-horse chariot race breaking headlong out of the gates to take the field , not even when charioteers lay on the rippling reins , leaning into the whip-stroke , giving the teams full head
1	the second trojan battalion paris led in arms with alcathous and agenor
1	topping off the armies rides camilla , sprung from the volscian people , heading her horsemen , squadrons gleaming bronze
1	and round it he cut a ditch in dark blue enamel and round the ditch he staked a fence in tin
1	what soldier could warm to that ?
1	and whirling round he cried to his trojans , shouting through the ruck , the wall , storm the wall !
1	shaking a spear polydamas moved in fast to the rescue , panthous ' son lancing the right shoulder of prothoenor , arielycus ' son , and the heavy shaft impaled his upper arm — he pitched in the dust , clawing the earth with both hands and polydamas shouted over him , wild with glory now : here is another spear that leaps from my strong arm , from panthous ' brave son , and hits its mark , by god !
1	they rush to ring the palace of king latinus round , but he stands fast like a rock at sea , a seabound rock that won ’ t give way : when a big surge hits and the howling breakers pound it hard , its bulk stands fast though its foaming reefs and spurs roar on , all for nothing , as seaweed dashing against its flanks swirls away in the backwash
1	if only she ’ d never been carried away to serve in such a war— bent on challenging trojans
1	but venus , incensed that the nymph has had her brazen way , steps up and plucks aeneas ’ spear from the clinging root
1	with that , he harnessed his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car , his pair that raced the wind with their golden manes streaming on behind them , and strapping golden armor around his body , zeus himself took up his whip that coils lithe and gold and climbed aboard
1	so meriones yelled and idomeneus whipped the team with their manes streaming , back to the hollow ships — fear seized the king at last
1	a dark glance and the headstrong runner answered him in kind : shameless — armored in shamelessness — always shrewd with greed !
1	he called out to his smaller , faster brother with orders flying , ajax , you stay here , you and the burly lycomedes stand your ground , keep our danaans fighting here with all they have got
1	the king has sons
1	but the swift runner achilles interjected , field marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , better busy yourself with that some other time , when a sudden lull in the fighting lets us rest and the fury 's not such fire inside my heart
1	then back to troy they bore deiphobus , groaning hard , in agony , blood from his fresh wound pouring down his arm
1	he grieves , he weeps , but then his tears are through
1	i am not from the same womb as hector , hector who killed your friend , your strong , gentle friend !
1	and sarpedon 's charge cut hector to the core
1	powerless now to keep that trojan king from italy ?
1	the achaean and trojan forces both exulted , hoping this would end the agonies of war
1	let this entire spread , plus highlands ringed with pines , be given the trojans now to win their friendship
1	they must be sitting there , waiting for us now
1	and the troops were growing bored , so at last the giant ajax spurred his rival , grunting , son of laertes — resourceful one , enough — you hoist me or i hoist you — and leave the rest to zeus
1	cut this shaft from my thigh
1	athena and blazing ares will deal with all the bloodshed
1	soon as his winged feet touched down on the first huts in sight , he spots aeneas founding the city fortifications , building homes in carthage
1	and catillus brings down iollas , then herminius , massive in courage , immense in brawn and armor , his blond locks flowing bare and his shoulders bare , no fear of wounds , so huge his body exposed to spears
1	the signs of the old flame , i know them well
1	always bringing word of mighty zeus 's plans , but not this time
1	he crashed in the dust — godlike achilles gloried over him : hector — surely you thought when you stripped patroclus ' armor that you , you would be safe !
1	we who defiled the fields of troy with swords— why mention all the pain we drank to the dregs , fighting beneath those walls , or the men we lost , drowned in simois river ?
1	no loving mother will bury you in the ground or weight your body down with your fathers ’ tomb
1	spun like locusts swarming up in the air , whipped by rushing fire , flitting toward a river — the tireless fire blazes , scorching them all with hard explosive blasts of flame and beaten down in the depths the floating locusts huddle — so at achilles ' charge the xanthus ' swirling currents choked with a spate of horse and men — the river roared
1	what patch of ground now holds your body cut to pieces , your mutilated corpse ?
1	my right hand will give you the earth you crossed the seas to find
1	the two men swarmed over him , ripping the armor off his back as hector called his kinsmen on , all his kinsmen , but marked out hicetaon 's son the strong melanippus , railing first at him
1	why mention the war that ’ s boiling up in tyre , your brother ’ s deadly threats ?
1	a powerful trunk is lying on the shore
1	her voice rang out in tears and an endless wail rose up and helen , the third in turn , led their songs of sorrow : hector !
1	still , do not fling in my face the lovely gifts of golden aphrodite
1	run for your life , my son
1	you will hear it all , and with you all the immortals — what a chain of disasters zeus brings to light !
1	the greeks had taken the city , blocked off every gate
1	but the mounting cries of war could not escape old nestor , pausing over his wine
1	and idomeneus shouted , vaunting in wild glory , now , deiphobus , now shall we call it quits at last ?
1	the gathered armies scattered , each man to his fast ship , and fighters turned their minds to thoughts of food and the sweet warm grip of sleep
1	and that comrade who meets his death and destiny , speared or stabbed , let him die !
1	he ranged their ranks , inspiriting every captain , commanding mesthles , glaucus , medon , thersilochus , asteropaeus , disenor , hippothous , phorcys , chromius , ennomus too , who could read the flight of birds
1	how could she outmaneuver zeus the mastermind , this zeus with his battle-shield of storm and thunder ?
1	twice he charged the thick of his foes , twice he broke their lines , stampeding the trojans down their walls at speed
1	two aides-de-camp , phegeus and sagaris , hefting it on their shoulders now , could hardly bear it off with all its heavy plies , yet demoleos wore it once , fully armed as he ran down trojan stragglers
1	these lands , they say , were once an immense unbroken mass but long ago—such is the power of time to work great change as the ages pass—some vast convulsion sprang them apart , a surge of the sea burst in between them , cleaving sicily clear of hesperia ’ s flanks , dividing lands and towns into two coasts , rushing between them down a narrow tiderip
1	come to me , priam
1	neither man could see it , scanning the dark night , they only heard its cry
1	so at his command automedon yoked the horses , the rapid stallions roan beauty and dapple , the team that raced the gales , magnificent team the storm-wind filly lightfoot foaled for the west wind , grazing the lush green grass along the ocean 's tides
1	perhaps he ’ s shipwrecked , lost in woods or towns
1	the lord of the city , so the trojans called him , because it was you , hector , you and you alone who shielded the gates and the long walls of troy
1	at the sight of hector the father of men and gods filled with pity now and shooting a terrible dark glance down at hera , burst out at her , what a disaster you create !
1	latinus himself is struck that these two giant men , sprung from opposing ends of the earth , have met , face-to-face , to let their swords decide
1	with his order clear , he sent his brother off while he went after nestor , the old commander
1	i say my honor lies in the great decree of zeus
1	yes , the time will come when turnus would give his all to have pallas whole , intact , when all this spoil , this very day he ’ ll loathe
1	down the sky she swooped through the clear bright air like a shrieking , sharp-winged hawk , and while achaeans quickly armed throughout the encampment , she instilled some nectar and sweet ambrosia deep in achilles ' chest so the stabbing pangs of hunger could not sap his knees
1	for i , i gave you this , all of my own free will but hardly willing
1	now be fast to attack !
1	i ’ ll give two cretan arrows with polished iron points and a double axe embossed with knobs of silver
1	his plan won hector over — less danger , more success — and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground
1	athena 's eyes lit up and the goddess said , so be it , archer of the sky !
1	magnificent paris spoke first : dear brother , look at me , holding you back in all your speed — dragging my feet , coming to you so late , and you told me to be quick !
1	so he lashed out at his sons , cursing the sight of helenus , paris , noble agathon , pammon , antiphonus , polites loud with the war cry , deiphobus and hippothous , even lordly dius — the old man shouted at all nine , rough commands : get to your work !
1	whatever i choose to plan apart from all the gods — no more of your everlasting questions , probe and pry no more
1	ajax struck him right where the head and neckbone join , the last link in the spine , he cut both tendons through so the mouth and brow and nostrils hit the ground before the shins and knees as the man dropped dead
1	from here the terrible news goes racing through the city , spirits plunge—latinus , rending his robes to tatters , stunned by his wife ’ s death and his city ’ s fall , fouls his white hair with showers of dust
1	i saw salmoneus too , who paid a brutal price for aping the flames of jove and olympus ’ thunder
1	the one peneleos lanced beneath the brows , down to the eyes ' roots and scooped an eyeball out — the spear cut clean through the socket , out behind the nape and backward down he sat , both hands stretched wide as peneleos , quickly drawing his whetted sword , hacked him square in the neck and lopped his head and down on the ground it tumbled , helmet and all
1	but what a price he paid !
1	well you know how the whims of youth break all the rules
1	i know his snowy hair , his beard—the first king to found our rome on laws , numa , sent from the poor town of cures , paltry land , to wield imperial power
1	greek i am , i don ’ t deny it
1	the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs from zeus are about to crush the men of troy !
1	standing round him , loving comrades mourned , and the swift runner achilles joined them , grieving , weeping warm tears when he saw his steadfast comrade lying dead on the bier , mauled by tearing bronze , the man he sent to war with team and chariot but never welcomed home again alive
1	sit down with the comrades you command
1	it arrives in force as acca brings her commander word of stark disaster : volscian units routed , camilla fallen , enemy armies surging on , attacking on all fronts , and mars in his triumph , panic already shakes the city walls
1	he urges all the trojans , all the argives too , to lay their fine armor down on the fertile earth while paris himself and the warrior menelaus take the field between you and fight it out for helen and all her wealth in single combat
1	once they gained the spot where the most and bravest stood , flanking strong diomedes breaker of wild stallions — massed like a pride of lions tearing raw flesh or ramping boars whose fury never flags — the white-armed goddess hera rose and shouted loud as the brazen voice of great-lunged stentor who cries out with the blast of fifty other men , shame !
1	how his spirit leapt when he heard those horrors — and buckling his gleaming armor round his body , out he rushed to war
1	and off to the side , beneath a spreading oak , the heralds were setting out the harvest feast , they were dressing a great ox they had slaughtered , while attendant women poured out barley , generous , glistening handfuls strewn for the reapers ' midday meal
1	but he , desperate to slow the death of his dying father , preferred to master the power of herbs , the skills that cure , and pursue a healer ’ s practice , silent and unsung
1	she knew the goddess at once , the long lithe neck , the smooth full breasts and the fire in those eyes — and she was amazed , she burst out with her name : maddening one , my goddess , oh what now ?
1	always turning toward the plain , tense to catch some sign of the trojans launching an attack
1	this flashing hector has all troy at his back !
1	quick , fetch him his weapons !
1	but they owe it all to their own fighting strength — our great men of war , they lead our way in battle !
1	then achilles made his way through crowds of troops and set out prizes next for the bruising boxing-match
1	automedon held the meats while lordly achilles carved them into quarters , cut them well into pieces , pierced them with spits and patroclus raked the hearth , a man like a god making the fire blaze
1	no sooner had sleep caught him , dissolving all his grief as mists of refreshing slumber poured around him there — his powerful frame was bone-weary from charging hector straight and hard to the walls of windswept troy — than the ghost of stricken patroclus drifted up
1	and they pay us reparations fair and fitting , a price to inspire generations still to come
1	no , he honored a suppliant ’ s rights , he blushed to betray my trust , he restored my hector ’ s bloodless corpse for burial , sent me safely home to the land i rule !
1	the father nods his head in assent , i see , at last he grants me glory , triumph — the argives , bloody death
1	perhaps a skilled prophet revealed the spot — or their own fury whips them on to attack
1	if he outruns us , crowd him against the ships , cut him off from his lines , harry him with your spear and never stop — so he ca not bolt back to troy
1	no doubt you will hand your argives victory soon , you will turn the tide of battle !
1	the same fighters who pile your gifts at aegae port and helice , gifts by the shipload , hoards to warm your heart
1	and the women he and patroclus carried off as captives caught the grief in their hearts and keened and wailed , out of the tents they ran to ring the great achilles , all of them beat their breasts with clenched fists , sank to the ground , each woman 's knees gave way
1	but the trojans stormed them there and back they fell , they had no choice , edging away from the front ships but once at the tents nearby they held their ground , massing ranks , no scattering back through camp
1	whether italy ’ s happy fate lays siege to the camp or the trojans ’ folly , the deadly prophecies they follow
1	flying free of his limbs his soul went winging down to the house of death , wailing his fate , leaving his manhood far behind , his young and supple strength
1	i bring you a message sent by zeus , a world away but he has you in his heart , he pities you now
1	and the horses , each beside its chariot , champing clover and parsley from the marshes , waited , pawing idly
1	and thoas son of andraemon led aetolia 's units , soldiers who lived in pleuron , pylene and olenus , chalcis along the shore and calydon 's rocky heights where the sons of wellborn oeneus were no more and the king himself was dead and meleager with his golden hair was gone
1	wherever he looked , pains heaped on pains
1	stepping back from the pyre he cut the red-gold lock he would let grow long as a gift to the river god spercheus — scanning the wine-dark sea he prayed in anguish , spercheus !
1	polydamas killed mecisteus — polites cut down echius , first in the onset — dashing agenor cut down clonius — and paris lanced deiochus deep below the shoulder , ran him through from behind as he fled the front and the bronze spear came jutting out his chest
1	but now that he 's torn my honor from my hands , robbed me , lied to me — do not let him try me now
1	but here 's a maniac run amok — no one can match his fury man-to-man !
1	it 's hard for me , strong as i am , single-handed to make for such a force and fight them all
1	triumphant athena turned her shining eyes away and aphrodite daughter of zeus took ares ' hand and led him off the field , racked with groans , barely able to gather back his strength
1	like leaves , no sooner flourishing , full of the sun 's fire , feeding on earth 's gifts , than they waste away and die
1	they ’ re robbed of half the world and the other half , dry land , is in our grasp , so many thousand italians take up arms
1	while the golden posts of high festal couches gleam , and a banquet spreads before their eyes with luxury fit for kings
1	i have no taste for food — what i really crave is slaughter and blood and the choking groans of men !
1	close by , the myrmidons clung to the panting stallions straining to bolt away , free of their masters ' chariot
1	that 's where his grave-mound will be piled and then no need in the world to raise his barrow high when comrades come to give him royal rites !
1	why did she force a man , so famous for his devotion , to brave such rounds of hardship , bear such trials ?
1	but it brought no joy to the heart of agamemnon
1	taken a wound , some spearhead sapped your strength ?
1	let the doom of troy pursue us just this far , no more
1	and let him hurry himself along as well , so he can overtake me before i leave the city
1	where can i find you now ?
1	trust me , he said , all i do will be worthy of your great exploit : your mother will be mine in all but the name , creusa
1	he hacks to ground dolichaon ’ s son , hebrus , latagus with him and palmus who spins and runs— he smashes latagus square in the face and mouth with a rock , a crag of a rock , and cuts the knees from under the racing palmus , leaves him slowly writhing in pain and gives his armor to lausus , bronze for his shoulders , plumes to crown his crest
1	nobody knows who shot it , whirled it on to bring the rutulians such renown—what luck , what god— the shining fame of the feat is shrouded over now
1	mantua , source of the five hundred men mezentius goaded on to fight against himself : men the mincius , son of father benacus gowned in gray-green reeds , steers down to the sea in warships built of pine
1	both of us rush together to halt this mortal 's onslaught !
1	i command the men , wage all-out war against this brutal crew !
1	let hector call you a coward , scorn your courage — the trojan and dardan troops will never believe him , nor will the wives of the lusty trojan shieldsmen , never — you flung their lords in the dust , laid them low in their prime !
1	twice he tried to engrave your fall in gold and twice his hands , a father ’ s hands , fell useless
1	if the soldier means to finish off our war by force , to rout the trojans now , he should have clashed with me and my weapon then , in combat man to man
1	famous hippodamia bore the warrior to pirithous that day he wreaked revenge on the shaggy centaurs , routed them out of pelion , drove them to the aethices
1	down in the ring he threw his pair of gauntlets , massive weights that violent eryx used to sport , binding his fists to fight with rawhide taut and tough
1	a man will yearn for his fill of all these joys before his fill of war
1	turnus shakes his head : i don ’ t fear you , you and your blazing threats , my fierce friend
1	not even ajax held his post , no longer now : forced by the shafts he backed away by inches , certain he would die there — down he leapt from the decks , down to bestride the seven-foot bridge amidships
1	next the locrians led by racing ajax , son of oileus , little ajax — a far cry from the size of telamonian ajax — a smaller man but trim in his skintight linen corslet , he outthrew all hellenes , all achaeans with his spear
1	news of the day and acestes ’ famous name had roused the people round about , and a happy crowd had thronged the shore , some to behold aeneas ’ men , some set to compete as well
1	smooth running rollers we wheel beneath its hoofs , and heavy hempen ropes we bind around its neck , and teeming with men-at-arms the huge deadly engine climbs our city walls
1	we have hoards inside the walls , the rich dowry old and famous altes presented with his daughter
1	you phrygians twice enslaved , penned up twice over inside blockaded ramparts , skulking away from death behind your walls !
1	we are still fighting it , no end in sight , and battling forces we outnumber — by far
1	a flash of his helmet and off he strode and quickly reached his sturdy , well-built house
1	will you save me ?
1	not among men , not among gods , if one 's still left who warms to feasts , his heart at peace , these days
1	drain to the lees the perils at sea and the whole wide earth while the trojans hunt for latium , hunt for troy reborn !
1	the team righted , pulled at the reins and again both fighters closed with savage frenzy , dueling now to the death
1	why did he muster an army , lead us here , that son of atreus ?
1	all this should obsess you , hector , night and day
1	they would raised his sleeping chamber , house and court adjoining priam 's and hector 's aloft the city heights
1	so he ordered , spurring each man 's nerve — and the next moment crowds of trojans once again would have clambered back inside their city walls , terror-struck by the argives primed for battle
1	but brilliant achilles strode along the surf , crying his piercing cry and roused achaean warriors
1	that moment zeus awoke on the heights of ida , stretched out by hera , queen of the golden throne — he leapt to his feet , he saw the trojans and achaeans , one side routed , the other harrying them in panic , achaeans attacking , and god poseidon led the way
1	praying on as aeneas broke in : a far cry from the words you mouthed before— die !
1	there , awed by the shrine of god , built strong of ancient stone , i begged apollo : grant us our own home , god of thymbra !
1	her father gave her away , wed for the first time , a virgin still , and these her first solemn rites
1	so come , all of us celebrate our happy , buoyant rites !
1	coon was just dragging his brother foot first , wild now to retrieve his own father 's son , calling for help from all the bravest men — but as coon hauled the body through the press agamemnon lunged up , under his bossed shield , thrust home hard with the polished bronze point , unstrung his limbs and reared and lopped his head and the head tumbled onto his fallen brother 's corpse
1	the raider of cities stood there , scepter in hand , and close beside him the great gray-eyed athena rose like a herald , ordering men to silence
1	but they have allies called from countless cities , fighters brandishing spears who block my way , who throw me far off course , thwarting my will to plunder ilium 's rugged walls
1	so it is some god rampaging !
1	but if he will not obey my orders , if he spurns them , let him beware , heart and soul — for all his power he can never muster the will to stand my onslaught
1	— doomed to the shortest life of any man on earth
1	but oileus ' son the racing ajax — not for a moment , not at all would he leave his giant brother ajax , shoulder-to-shoulder they fought together here : close as a brace of wine-dark oxen matched in power , dragging a bolted plow through packed fallow land and the sweat rushes up at the roots of both their horns and only the width of polished yoke keeps both beasts apart , struggling up the furrow to cut the field 's last strip
1	he struck him right where the midriff packs the pounding heart and down sarpedon fell as an oak or white poplar falls or towering pine that shipwrights up on a mountain hew down with whetted axes for sturdy ship timber — so he stretched in front of his team and chariot , sprawled and roaring , clawing the bloody dust
1	enraged at that , achilles shouted in mid-stride , you have blocked my way , you distant , deadly archer , deadliest god of all — you made me swerve away from the rampart there
1	yes but i dread it so — what if great achilles has cut my hector off from the city , daring hector , and driven him out across the plain , and all alone ?
1	when hector saw no sign of his loyal wife inside he went to the doorway , stopped and asked the servants , come , please , tell me the truth now , women
1	but enormous pandarus breaks ranks , afire with rage at his brother ’ s death , and shouts : no palace here , your dowry from amata !
1	so the ghost of my father , so my son declares
1	a great battle rises before us !
1	he would never be at the front , smashing our lines unless old thunder , zeus , had put him on his feet
1	a race i loathe is crossing the tuscan sea , transporting troy to italy , bearing their conquered household gods— thrash your winds to fury , sink their warships , overwhelm them or break them apart , scatter their crews , drown them all !
1	but god apollo himself spurred on aeneas , taking the build of periphas , summoner 's son who had grown old as herald to aeneas ' father the aged king — a loving , loyal herald too
1	stupid too , first and last the worst man in the argive armies — stubborn , bullnecked fool
1	sinon , adept at deceit , with all his greek cunning lifted his hands , just freed from their fetters , up to the stars and prayed : bear witness , you eternal fires of the sky and you inviolate will of the gods !
1	servants pour them water to rinse their hands , quickly serving them bread from baskets , spreading their laps with linens , napkins clipped and smooth
1	the dogs and birds will rend you — blood and bone !
1	then i would face any fate
1	clearly it 's not my fate to journey home again to the fatherland i love , to bring some joy to my dear wife , my baby son
1	all the gates flung wide and the trojan mass surged out , horses , chariots , men on foot — a tremendous roar went up
1	everywhere , black tides of blood , iron clashing , slaughter , fighters striving for death with glory through their wounds
1	let achilles cut me down straightway — once i have caught my son in my arms and wept my fill !
1	you alone , she cries , you deserve the virgin !
1	the epeans ringed that fort , keen to raze its walls , but once their troops had swept the entire plain , down athena rushed to us in the night , a herald down from olympus crying out , to arms !
1	his mother had borne him along the simois ' banks when she trailed her parents down the slopes of ida to tend their flocks , and so they called him simoisius
1	now how can you go about this ?
1	come they did , quickly , two shepherds behind them , playing their hearts out on their pipes — treachery never crossed their minds
1	a little , not for long
1	what company you keep now , these wretched trojans
1	some men hang on billowing crests , some as the sea gapes , glimpse through the waves the bottom waiting , a surge aswirl with sand
1	dardan skirmishers hand-to-hand — stand by me here !
1	zeus fitted the armor tightly on hector 's body and ares surged in his heart with awesome force , filling his limbs with power and fighting strength
1	now , dazzling in all her rich regalia , head to foot , out of her rooms she strode and beckoned aphrodite away from the other gods and whispered , dear child , would you do me a favor
1	a terrific brazen blast went blaring out from the trumpets far and wide and war cries echo the horns and the high sky resounds
1	do not think struggle and pain will be ours alone — your day will come to die in blood like him
1	what good have the syrtes been to me , or scylla or gaping charybdis ?
1	so the commander ranged achaea 's ranks and brought them into line
1	testing his men but he only made the spirit race inside their chests , all the rank and file who would never heard his plan
1	achilles lay there now but he would soon rise up in all his power
1	these gallant , die-hard trojans , even those i have killed , they will all come rising back from the western gloom !
1	and he clenches his quarry ’ s flesh as the sopping gore soaks his ruthless maw—just so mezentius pounces hotly onto the enemy masses
1	come — see if we can arm the achaeans for assault
1	telamonian ajax voiced frustration first : dear god , enough !
1	are not you sick of being caged inside those walls ?
1	now like a flashing eagle swooping down on bird-flocks , winged thousands feeding , swarming a river 's banks , geese , cranes or swans with their long lancing necks — so swooping hector went headfirst at a warship , charged its purple prow , and zeus behind him thrust him on with his mighty , deathless hand , urging the soldiers on who crowded hector 's back
1	and now the misty phantom , no longer hunting for cover , flutters up on high , dissolving into a dark cloud
1	no , my soft friends , wretched excuses — women , not men of achaea !
1	she calls menelaus in and flings the doors wide open , hoping no doubt by this grand gift to him , her lover , to wipe the slate clean of her former wicked ways
1	yes , well , they know all about that , the argives young and old
1	what honor will he gain ?
1	you , caesar , you be first in mercy—you trace your line from olympus— born of my blood , throw down your weapons now !
1	nevertheless his son was lashing fiery chargers down the level fields , his chariot hurtling virbius into battle
1	two bars of solid gold shone on the ground before them , a prize for the judge who would speak the straightest verdict
1	for turnus too , his own fate calls , and the man has reached the end of all his days on earth
1	a busy , willing servant answered quickly , hector , seeing you want to know the truth , she has not gone to your sisters , brothers ' wives or athena 's shrine where the noble trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over
1	you scratch my foot and you are vaunting all the same — but who cares ?
1	when a man ca not catch another fleeing on ahead and he can never escape nor his rival overtake him — so the one could never run the other down in his speed nor the other spring away
1	i ’ d urge my son to accept , but his blood is mixed , half sabine , thanks to his mother , and so , italian
1	where god and relentless fortune call us on , that ’ s the way we go !
1	riding high on our loss the epeans rose in arms , lording over us , harassing us with outrage after outrage
1	past all other men , all other achaean comrades , we long to be your closest , dearest friends
1	safe haven after storm wars and a man i sing—an exile driven on by fate , he was the first to flee the coast of troy , destined to reach lavinian shores and italian soil , yet many blows he took on land and sea from the gods above— thanks to cruel juno ’ s relentless rage—and many losses he bore in battle too , before he could found a city , bring his gods to latium , source of the latin race , the alban lords and the high walls of rome
1	totally spent in war , they ’ d all deserted , down from the roofs they ’ d flung themselves to earth or hurled their broken bodies in the flames
1	now he would have hauled him off and won undying glory but aphrodite , zeus 's daughter quick to the mark , snapped the rawhide strap , cut from a bludgeoned ox , and the helmet came off empty in menelaus ' fist
1	so i was the one who raised your empty tomb on rhoeteum cape and called out to your shade three times with a ringing voice
1	to loot the fallen , one of the fighters ' corpses ?
1	but the winds scatter them all , all useless , fling them into the clouds
1	grynean apollo ’ s oracle says that i must seize on italy ’ s noble land , his lycian lots say italy !
1	or the gracchi and their kin ?
1	high time you felt at ease with comrades ’ fare
1	then , quick to the call that cursed trumpet gave , the wild herdsmen gather from every quarter , snatching arms in haste
1	our side is so much stronger
1	panthus , where ’ s our stronghold ?
1	zeus my witness now , hera 's lord whose thunder drums the sky !
1	he savored every word of nestor 's story
1	they know their king far off , circling , dancing round him and one , most eloquent of them all , cymodocea swims in on his wake and grips his stern with her right hand , arching her back above the swells as her left hand rows the silent waves , and she calls out to aeneas , lost to it all : awake , aeneas , son of the gods ?
1	three lives his mother feronia gave him at his birth— i shudder to say it now—three suits of armor for action
1	but on came greek reserves , no letup , the hail of rocks , the missiles of every kind would never cease
1	and years ago , propped on his father 's knee , he would only eat the marrow , the richest cuts of lamb , and when sleep came on him and he had quit his play , cradled warm in his nurse 's arms he would drowse off , snug in a soft bed , his heart brimmed with joy
1	just ask the gods for pardon , win them with offerings
1	one horse was finished , hit by a shaft that fair-haired helen 's lord , magnificent paris winged at its brow 's high peak where the forelock crowns the skull — most fatal spot
1	but since i was blinded , lost in my own inhuman rage , now , at last , i am bent on setting things to rights : i will give a priceless ransom paid for friendship
1	you would never dream he 's come from fighting a man , you would think he 's off to a dance or slipped away from the dancing , stretching out at ease
1	soon , in a moment , you can have your fill of tears — once i have brought him home
1	so ran his parting orders , aeneas , best of captains : if any crisis comes while i am away , don ’ t risk a pitched battle , no , don ’ t trust to the open field , just guard the camp and ramparts , safe behind the walls
1	picus was faunus ’ father , and picus boasted you as his sire , great saturn , you , the founder of the bloodline
1	enjoy it , all of it — return to your own native land , safe and sound
1	all he sees is wild , untilled— what men , or what creatures ?
1	but achilles went for paeonians , helmets plumed , still running in panic along the river 's rapids once they saw their finest fall in the onslaught , beaten down by pelides ' hands and hacking sword
1	come , now for attack !
1	pisa placed them at his command , a greek city born by the river alpheus , bred by tuscan soil
1	till our ships that line the shore go up in flames , gutted , despite a last-ditch stand ?
1	but now venus is mulling over some new schemes , new intrigues
1	drances rises , aggressive as always , stung by turnus ’ glory , spurred by smarting , barely hidden envy— a lavish spender , his rhetoric even looser , but a frozen hand in battle
1	here he glimpses phaedra , procris , and eriphyle grieving , baring the wounds her heartless son had dealt her
1	all of it false but the king seethed when he heard a tale like that
1	and the prayers trail after , trying to heal the wounds
1	the minds of the younger men are always flighty , but let an old man stand his ground among them , one who can see the days behind , the days ahead — that is the best hope for peace , for both our armies
1	where ’ s his murderous fury ?
1	the young spearmen will do the work with spears
1	but shout wherever you go , tell them to stay awake
1	i see a man — i am afraid we will both be butchered on the spot — into the chariot , hurry !
1	hermes harnessed the mules and team for both men , drove them fast through the camp and no one saw them
1	so come , alone as we are , find the best way out : how do we pull the body clear and save ourselves , make it back to our lines and bring our friends some joy ?
1	now the raw wound saps my strength
1	there in latium you must battle down a people of wild , rugged ways
1	why waste your speed ?
1	the enemy holds our walls
1	fast as iphiclus was , i raced him to his knees , with a spear i outhurled phyleus , polydorus too
1	she won ’ t sit tight while fate is turning on its hinge
1	but the healer applied his pain-killing drugs and sealed hades ' wound — he was not born to die
1	so the proud father declared to all immortals , 'hear me , all you gods and all goddesses too , as i proclaim what 's brooding deep inside me
1	even so , patroclus , fight disaster off the ships , fling yourself at the trojans full force — before they gut our hulls with leaping fire and tear away the beloved day of our return
1	and the torches light the road , searing a long line through flatlands far and wide
1	in his command sailed forty long black ships
1	we are the ones who stormed the seven gates of thebes , heading a weaker force and facing stronger walls but obeying the gods ' signs and backed by zeus
1	she was up in flames at once , engulfed in quenchless fire , in a flash the blaze went swirling round the stern and achilles slapped his thighs and urged patroclus , to arms — patroclus , prince and master horseman !
1	his beard matted now , his hair clotted with blood , bearing the wounds , so many wounds he suffered fighting round his native city ’ s walls
1	and now you rampage on among our deep-sea ships , wild to torch our hulls and kill our heroes — well , you will be stopped , somewhere , mad as you are for combat !
1	but now , at the twelfth dawn since hector 's death , lord apollo rose and addressed the immortal powers : hard-hearted you are , you gods , you live for cruelty !
1	well , here i sail and begin to build our first walls on the curving shore , though fate will block our way—and i give the town the name of aenus modeled on my own
1	book eleven : agamemnon 's day of glory
1	or any gift of the greeks is free of guile ?
1	achilles ' call rang out and it brought the fastest drivers crowding forward
1	dread what comrades say of you here in bloody combat !
1	then at patroclus ' fourth assault like something superhuman , the god shrieked down his winging words of terror : back — patroclus , prince , go back !
1	you are goddesses , you are everywhere , you know all things — all we hear is the distant ring of glory , we know nothing — who were the captains of achaea ?
1	altes who rules the leleges always keen for war , who holds the pedasus heights along the satniois — and priam wed his daughter , with many other wives , and she produced two sons , and you , you will butcher both !
1	ascanius , father anchises , and all the gods of troy , entrusting them to my friends , i hide them well away in a valley ’ s shelter , don my burnished gear and back i go to troy
1	so that 's the man i was
1	the white-armed hera beat me !
1	here the cursed lust for the bull and pasiphaë spread beneath him , duping both her mates , and here the mixed breed , part man , part beast , the minotaur— a warning against such monstrous passion
1	finally achilles produced a spear that trailed its long shadow , a cauldron too , untouched by fire , chased with flowers and worth an ox , and set them down in the ring
1	i hope , i pray , if the just gods still have any power , wrecked on the rocks mid-sea you ’ ll drink your bowl of pain to the dregs , crying out the name of dido over and over , and worlds away i ’ ll hound you then with pitch-black flames , and when icy death has severed my body from its breath , then my ghost will stalk you through the world !
1	now our men are lying mauled on the field — all that hector the son of priam overwhelmed when zeus was handing hector his high glory — but you , you and odysseus urge us to a banquet !
1	then i was awestruck , stunned by doubt and dread
1	but the gods who live at ease lashed out against him — worse , the son of cronus struck lycurgus blind
1	so dido pleads and so her desolate sister takes him the tale of tears again and again
1	nine heralds shouted out , trying to keep some order , quiet , battalions , silence !
1	he still ca not block the power of man-killing hector !
1	vaunting over the dark that swept his quarry 's eyes and the running-rims of argive war-cars cut him to shreds at the onset 's breaking edge
1	and the swift runner achilles answered quickly , son of menoetius , soldier after my own heart , now i think they will grovel at my knees , our achaean comrades begging for their lives
1	your achaean comrades , young and old , will exalt you all the more
1	— hector 's life and his battle-frenzy blotted out by the argives here on hector 's native soil
1	but the winds bring him a hint of hidden terrors , mingled cries drifting out of the town in chaos
1	the queen calls for a heavy golden bowl , studded with jewels and brimmed with unmixed wine , the bowl that belus and all of belus ’ sons had brimmed , and the hall falls hushed as dido lifts a prayer : jupiter , you , they say , are the god who grants the laws of host and guest
1	giant ajax drives them — i recognize the man , that wall of a buckler slung around his shoulders
1	riding high with latinus ’ gifts and words , aeneas ’ envoys bring back news of peace
1	thymoetes leads the way
1	she seated her on a handsome , well-wrought chair , studded with silver , under it slipped a stool and called the famous smith : hephaestus , come — look who 's here !
1	odysseus quick with tactics answered , courage
1	scuttling left and right when they saw him down , their chariot captain who would outfought them all
1	he consults the grove below albunea ’ s heights , where the grand woods resound with a holy spring and exhale their dark , deadly fumes
1	achilles will listen to you — for his own good
1	hippothous led the pelasgian tribes of spearmen , fighters who worked larissa 's dark rich plowland
1	now carved out of the rocky flanks of cumae lies an enormous cavern pierced by a hundred tunnels , a hundred mouths with as many voices rushing out , the sibyl ’ s rapt replies
1	on the rampart ’ s left wing—the river flanks the right— the hardened troops of aeneas group in battle order , facing enemy lines and manning the broad trench or stationed up on the towers—wrung with sorrow , men stunned by the sight of men they know too well , their heads stuck on pikestaffs dripping gore
1	now let heralds dear to zeus cry out through the streets of troy that boys in their prime and old gray-headed men must take up posts on the towers built by the gods , in bivouac round the city
1	i was a fool — i never meant to kill him — quarreling over a dice game
1	a dark glance — and the headstrong runner answered , no more , old man , do not tempt my wrath , not now !
1	if mighty zeus , thundering up on high , is bent on wiping out the argives , down to the last man , if he longs to back our trojan forces to the hilt , by heaven i hope the father works his will at once and the argives die here , their memory blotted out , a world away from argos !
1	but both balked at returning now to the ships moored at the hellespont 's far-reaching shore or galloping back to fight beside the argives
1	the god of the earthquake swept beside him there and gave the man a burst of winging orders : aeneas — what god on high commands you to play the madman ?
1	now at dusk she calls for the feast to start again , madly begging to hear again the agony of troy , to hang on his lips again , savoring his story
1	euaemon 's son eurypylus cut down brave hypsenor , son of lofty dolopion , a man the trojans made scamander 's priest and worshipped like a god
1	entellus returns : my love of glory , my pride still holds strong , not beaten down by fear
1	your prizes are yours , said captain aeneas firmly , they all stand fast , young comrades
1	and prothous son of tenthredon led the magnesians , men who lived around the peneus , up along mount pelion sloped in wind-whipped leaves
1	themis made her rounds , ranging far and wide and summoned all to march to father 's halls
1	but even now , late as it is , you could tell your achilles all this and your fiery friend might listen
1	zeus and poseidon taught you horsemanship , every sort , so there 's no great need for me to set you straight
1	but devout aeneas now—the last rites performed and the grave-mound piled high—once the seas lie calm , sets sail on his journey , puts the port astern
1	hector would always call the boy scamandrius , townsmen called him astyanax , lord of the city , since hector was the lone defense of troy
1	as he turned things over , apollo stood beside him , taking the shape of that lusty rugged fighter asius , an uncle of stallion-breaking hector , a blood brother of hecuba , son of dymas who lived in phrygia near sangarius ' rapids
1	there we slaughtered fine victims to mighty zeus , a bull to alpheus river , a bull to lord poseidon and an unyoked cow to blazing-eyed athena
1	fighting epeans over a cattle-raid i killed itymoneus , hypirochus ' gallant son who used to live in elis
1	from the polished wagon they lifted the priceless ransom brought for hector 's corpse but they left behind two capes and a finely-woven shirt to shroud the body well when priam bore him home
1	nisus , wild as a starved lion raging through crowded pens as the hunger drives him mad , and he mangles sheep , dumb with terror , rips to shreds their tender flesh and roars from bloody jaws
1	antiphus hurled at him — the son of priam wearing a gleaming breastplate let fly through the lines but his sharp spear missed and he hit leucus instead , odysseus ' loyal comrade , gouging his groin as the man hauled off a corpse — it dropped from his hands and leucus sprawled across it
1	i have weapons too , old father , and no weak , untempered spears go flying from my right hand— from the wounds we deal the blood comes flowing too
1	a mammoth clash — the wide earth roared and the arching vault of heaven echoed round with trumpets !
1	another thing — take it to heart , i urge you
1	see porsenna to the life , his likeness menacing , raging , and why ?
1	rage finds them arms but then , if they chance to see a man among them , one whose devotion and public service lend him weight , they stand there , stock-still with their ears alert as he rules their furor with his words and calms their passion
1	take your posts through camp
1	so raced this daughter of night and sped to earth
1	the immense double gates are flung wide open , greeks in their thousands mass there , all who ever sailed from proud mycenae
1	they swept in like hounds that fling themselves at a wounded boar before young hunters reach him , darting in for a moment , keen to rip the boar apart till he wheels at bay , ramping into the pack with all his power and the hounds cringe and bolt and scatter left and right
1	all will end as the omen says , i do believe , if the bird-sign really came to us , the trojans , just as our fighters tried to cross the trench
1	why prowling among the ships , cut off from camp , alone in the dead of night when other men are sleeping ?
1	down from the high skies the father of men and gods let loose tremendous thunder — from down below poseidon shook the boundless earth and towering heads of mountains
1	not for all the world
1	they will ask that man to every feast and revel
1	not even i would deny it
1	but now the war , the deafening crash of battle blazed around the strong-built work , and rampart timbers thundered under the heavy blows as argive fighters beaten down by the lash of zeus were rolled back , pinned to their beaked ships in dread of hector , that invincible headlong terror
1	out of the field of battle , streaming into town whole troops of herdsmen are bringing home the dead— almo the young boy , galaesus with his butchered face— and they beg the gods for rescue , pleading with latinus
1	if he lends his name , they ’ ll call the town acesta
1	and nestor the seasoned charioteer replied , true , atrides , if only i were the man i was , years ago , when i cut down rugged ereuthalion
1	do not waste your breath
1	run free , my ships—run , you nymphs of the sea !
1	look , the pilot palinurus was drifting toward him now , fresh from the libyan run where , watching the stars , he plunged from his stern , pitched out in heavy seas
1	now , with the ridge of sicily barely out of sight , they spread sail for the open sea , their spirits buoyant , their bronze beaks churning the waves to foam as juno , nursing deep in her heart the everlasting wound , said to herself : defeated , am i ?
1	turning back to his team , calling , shouting them on : do not hold back , do not stop now — galled as you are — that team in the lead will sag in the leg before you — robbed of their prime , their racing days are done !
1	not that he will glory in it long , i tell you : his own destruction hovers near him now
1	why , i clearly had earned the crown for first prize if the same bad luck that leveled salius had not knocked me down !
1	for the first event , enter , four great ships , well matched with their heavy oars , picked from the whole armada
1	what divides them all ?
1	but once they reached the ford where the river runs clear , the strong , whirling xanthus sprung of immortal zeus , achilles split the trojan rout , driving one half back toward the city , scattering up the plain where achaeans themselves stampeded off in terror just the day before when hector raged unchecked
1	nor did the white-armed hera fail to see anchises ' son advancing there through the press to face achilles
1	and pallas ’ shield , for all its layers of iron and bronze , its countless layers of oxhide rounding it out for strength—still turnus ’ vibrant spear goes shattering through the shield with stabbing impact , piercing the breastplate ’ s guard and pallas ’ broad chest
1	bands of sailors , primed for action , leap out onto land—hesperian land
1	why make us lords of estates along the xanthus ' banks , rich in vineyards and plowland rolling wheat ?
1	but odysseus stepped in quickly , faced him down with a dark glance and threats to break his nerve : what a flood of abuse , thersites !
1	now , at last , the neck of troy 's in the noose — her doom is sealed
1	holding fast in his grip a lightning bolt he drove iris down in a rush of golden wings to bear his message : away with you now , iris — quick as the wind and speed this word to hector
1	three times tydides was tempted , heart and soul , three times from the crags of ida zeus let loose his thunder , the master strategist handing down a sign to the trojans — victory thunder turning the tide of war their way
1	just as he lunged i speared the man with a bronze lance and mulius pitched in the dust as i , i swung aboard his car and i took my place in our front ranks of champions
1	but now , my comrades , seeing the best part of the day is done , for the rest , refresh yourselves , hearts high
1	the armies prayed and stretched their hands to the gods
1	that woman , that vagrant !
1	whatever we dragged from towns we plundered , all 's been portioned out
1	where is the bow that god apollo gave you ?
1	and turnus too : track down the roots of his house and who are his forebears ?
1	the crowd springs up , sicilians , trojans , rival outcries hit the sky
1	drag them down to the bright sea !
1	what do i do now ?
1	i ’ m here to implore you now : pity your own people
1	all men and gods , in wisdom clear and calm — but all this brutal carnage comes from you
1	better to slaughter seven bulls from a herd unbroken by the yoke , as the old rite requires , and as many head of teething yearling sheep
1	on that note both men harnessed up in the grim gear of war
1	die , trojans , die — till i butcher all the way to sacred troy — run headlong on , i will hack you from behind !
1	then when the dawn 's red fingers shine in all their glory , quickly deploy your chariots and battalions , agamemnon , out in front of the ships — you spur them on and you yourself , you fight in the front ranks !
1	his prayer went up and phoebus apollo heard him
1	aeneas knows nothing , the man is miles away ’ ?
1	my mother , of priam ’ s ancient stock—poor woman !
1	and tall hector nodded , his helmet flashing : all this weighs on my mind too , dear woman
1	then too latinus was pressed to declare war on aeneas ’ sons with the same custom , to unbar the deadly gates
1	and when at a distance she could see— clear in the thick of battle , war cries , warriors ’ fury— camilla beaten down by the brutal stroke of death , she moaned , crying out from the bottom of her heart : too cruel , dear girl , too cruel the price you pay for trying , begging to challenge the men of troy in combat !
1	go sing that song , you fool , for the trojan chief—your own prospects too
1	how young you are
1	with that , at least , i consoled myself for troy ’ s demise , that heartrending ruin—weighing fate against fate
1	his combed , flowing beard spreading across his chest , he tries to limber his neck , panting , heaving in torment
1	with that he heaved up from the anvil block — his immense hulk hobbling along but his shrunken legs moved nimbly
1	but sarpedon the lycian captain faced him down : right you are , tlepolemus !
1	here came to an end the games in honor of aeneas ’ hallowed father
1	the rutulian king and the latin captains marvel till , glancing back , they see an armada heading toward the shore and the whole sea rolling down on them now in a tide of ships
1	still in retreat , turnus , why ?
1	you must surrender helen and all her treasure with her
1	there 's no achieving our mission here , i see , not with this approach
1	one ship that carried the lycian units led by staunch orontes— before aeneas ’ eyes a toppling summit of water strikes the stern and hurls the helmsman overboard , pitching him headfirst , twirling his ship three times , right on the spot till the ravenous whirlpool gulps her down
1	rescued zeus , the lord of the dark storm cloud , from ignominious , stark defeat
1	from there he leads aeneas on to tarpeia ’ s house and the capitol , all gold now but once in the old days , thorny , dense with thickets
1	she had seen how thetis , the old man of the sea 's daughter , thetis quick on her glistening feet was hatching plans with zeus
1	with fresh zeal aeneas resumes his father ’ s rites , wondering , is the serpent the genius of the place ?
1	no shame in the man , shame that does great harm or drives men on to good
1	but if words of mine could lure them back to love , back to bed , to lock in each other 's arms once more
1	cries of terror breaking as trojans choked all roads , their lines ripped to pieces , up from under the hoofs a dust storm swirling into the clouds as rearing horses broke into stride again and galloped back to troy , leaving ships and shelters in their wake
1	nor does aeneas flag , though slowed down by his wound , his knees unsteady , cutting his pace at times but he ’ s still in full fury , hot on his frantic quarry ’ s tracks , stride for stride
1	and glaucus next
1	the deadly archer loves his trojans dearly
1	whatever it is , i fear the greeks , especially bearing gifts
1	so , driven by madness , beaten down by anguish , dido was fixed on dying , working out in her mind the means , the moment
1	god drove me to your shores
1	come , achilles , no more bragging on this way like boys , standing here in the thick of a pitched battle
1	what if you are a great soldier ?
1	i will soon see if the mighty diomedes rams me back from the ships and back against our walls or i kill him with bronze and strip his bloody armor !
1	quickly cloaking herself in shimmering linen , out of her rooms she rushed , live tears welling , and not alone — two of her women followed close behind , aethra , pittheus ' daughter , and clymene , eyes wide , and they soon reached the looming scaean gates
1	if not , no strength within you can overpower it , no iron blade , however hard , can tear it off
1	grieved as you are , bear up , or dear as you are , i have to see you beaten right before my eyes
1	the silver hubs spin round on either side of the chariot 's woven body , gold and silver lashings strapping it tight , double rails sweeping along its deep full curves and the yoke-pole jutting forward , gleaming silver
1	so ajax vaunted , knowing his victim full well , and a raw revulsion seized the trojans ' hearts
1	victory shifts , you know , now one man , now another
1	no need for such an outburst — get a grip on yourself , distraught as you are
1	and men will forget those ramparts i and apollo reared for troy in the old days — for the hero laomedon — we broke our backs with labor
1	disgraced my horsemanship — you have fouled my horses , cutting before me , you with your far slower team
1	and rallying other gods around her , hera shouted , bend to the work , you two , poseidon , athena , decide in your hearts how this assault will go !
1	caedicus chops alcathous down—sacrator , hydaspes— rapo kills parthenius , then the indestructible orses
1	for the man we cut down here was the loyal friend of prince achilles — far the greatest among the argive ships and at his command go rugged fighters hand-to-hand
1	first he wrapped his legs with the well-made greaves , fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps , next he strapped the breastplate round his chest , blazoned with stars — swift achilles ' own — then over his shoulder patroclus slung the sword , the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt , and then the shield-strap and the sturdy , massive shield and over his powerful head he set the well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror , and he took two rugged spears that fit his grip
1	but turnus flying on ahead of his slower column , flanked by a picked troop of twenty horsemen , gains the town in no time , borne by a thracian charger blazed with white , and helmed in his golden casque with crimson crest
1	one man is a splendid fighter — a god has made him so — one 's a dancer , another skilled at lyre and song , and deep in the next man 's chest farseeing zeus plants the gift of judgment , good clear sense
1	a god impels all things to their fulfillment : ruin , eldest daughter of zeus , she blinds us all , that fatal madness — she with those delicate feet of hers , never touching the earth , gliding over the heads of men to trap us all
1	ah , but old age , sluggish , cold , played out with the years , has me in its grip , denies me the command
1	did he groan when i wept ?
1	in the same breath , blazing with wrath he plants his iron sword hilt-deep in his enemy ’ s heart
1	ajax lunged at the man , he struck his shield but the point would not pierce through , so he beat him back in rage and he edged away from the breastwork just a yard
1	teucer the master archer rose to meet the challenge , meriones joined him , idomeneus ' rough-and-ready aide
1	so off you go now
1	shipmates furl the sails and swing the prows toward land
1	there ’ s hope for peace as well
1	your naked corpse will lie on an unknown shore
1	rhipeus , dymas too and our corps of young recruits—each fighter arms himself in the loot that he just seized and on we forge , blending in with the enemy , battling time and again under strange gods , fighting hand-to-hand in the blind dark and many greeks we send to the king of death
1	my own son hephaestus , the burly crippled smith will forge it finely and under it slide a stool where you can prop your glistening feet and rest , stretching out at feasts
1	and with that command queen hera strode home and regained her throne
1	each man he would stand above and chop with the sword , the cool tactician odysseus grappled from behind , grabbing the fighter 's heels , dragging him out of the way with one thought in mind : that team with their flowing manes must get through fast , not quake at heart and balk , trampling over the dead , those purebred horses still not used to corpses
1	and beside each a brace of stallions standing poised and pawing , champing their oats and barley glistening white
1	the silver cave was shimmering full of sea-nymphs , all in one mounting chorus beating their breasts as thetis launched the dirge : hear me , sisters , daughters of nereus , so you all will know it well — listen to all the sorrows welling in my heart !
1	better to clash in battle , now , at once — see which fighter zeus awards the glory !
1	atreus ’ sons , they ’ re not alone in suffering such a wound , not only mycenae has a right to go to war
1	— till you can make your raid and test my story , see if i have told the truth or i have been lying
1	they closed ranks , they packed like a stone wall , a granite cliff that towers against the churning surf , standing up to the screaming winds , their sudden assaults and the breaking waves they spawn that crash against its base — so the danaans stood the trojan onslaught , rock-solid and never flinched in fear
1	he would bolted golden wheels to the legs of each so all on their own speed , at a nod from him , they could roll to halls where the gods convene then roll right home again — a marvel to behold
1	oh the two of us !
1	they mixed the contenders ' wine in a large bowl and rinsed the warlords ' waiting hands with water
1	there was a vast cave deep in the gaping , jagged rock , shielded well by a dusky lake and shadowed grove
1	but the butcher did see tydeus ' rugged son and he dropped gigantic periphas on the spot where he would just killed him , ripped his life away and ares whirled at the stallion-breaking diomedes — the two of them closing fast , charging face-to-face and the god thrust first , over tydides ' yoke and reins , with bronze spear burning to take the fighter 's life
1	well i know you are brave , and i am far weaker
1	throughout the house his daughters and sons ' wives wailed , remembering all the fine brave men who lay dead now , their lives destroyed at the fighting argives ' hands
1	the plans of zeus will never bring them off , those dreams of glory inspiring hector now
1	now , the turn itself — it 's clear , you can not miss it
1	then we would have done with fighting long ago , razed the rugged walls of troy and laid her waste
1	who could maim you so ?
1	another achaean armed in bronze may well be blind to the way i fight
1	with that he hurled a heavy lance at the great and awesome shield and its massive surface clanged as it took the point
1	and so under shelter now menoetius ' fighting son was healing eurypylus ' wounds
1	his slashing sword had already hacked off anxur ’ s left arm and his round buckler slammed the ground
1	hector caught his breath and his eyes cleared , he crouched down on his knees to vomit dark clots then slumped back down , stretched on the ground again and the world went black as night across his eyes
1	and all the woodcutters hoisted logs themselves — by command of idomeneus ' good aide meriones — and they heaved them down in rows along the beach at the site achilles chose to build an immense mound for patroclus and himself
1	and down she sat on her father 's lap , a young girl , sobbing , her deathless robe quivering round her body
1	why , not even i would rail against that man , that worthless coward who cringes from the fighting
1	swear you will do the same
1	that time you vaunted you were the finest force on earth — all that empty bluster you let fly at lemnos , gorging yourselves on longhorn cattle meat and drunk to the full on brimming bowls of wine , bragging how each man could stand up to a hundred , no , two hundred trojan fighters in pitched battle
1	now his shield took powerful agamemnon 's spear but failed to deflect it , straight through it smashed , bronze splitting his belt and plunging down his guts — he fell , thundering , armor ringing against him
1	at tarchon ’ s command his shipmates rise to their oars and drive their vessels foaming onto the latian shore until their beaks have gripped dry land , all keels beached safe and sound , all but your own ship , tarchon
1	trying to lift the soldier 's heart with stories , applying soothing drugs to his dreadful wound as he sought to calm the black waves of pain
1	but the father paid no heed to them
1	no , go boast to your heart 's content and tell the gods you triumphed over me with your superhuman power !
1	but all the rest of you , come , all achaeans in camp who trust to your teams and bolted chariots — take your places now !
1	not even the stretch of beach , broad as it was , could offer berths to all that massed armada , troops were crammed in a narrow strip of coast
1	so you can not challenge my birth as low , cowardly , or spurn the advice i give , if the plan is really sound
1	the tambourines , they ’ re calling for you now , and the boxwood flutes of your berecynthian mother perched on ida !
1	the tallest trunk there was on the heights of ida , it pierced the low-hung mist and shot up through the sky
1	enough of this madness — striving with the gods
1	give ground , but faces fronting the trojans always — no use trying to fight the gods in force
1	all flocked to the halls of zeus who gathers storms and found their seats in the colonnades of polished stone hephaestus built for father zeus with all his craft and cunning
1	out of his rich guarded chamber the god himself launched aeneas now , driving courage into his heart and the captain took his place amidst his men
1	and thetis answered , bursting into tears , o my son , my sorrow , why did i ever bear you ?
1	he left his armored men along the asopus banks and carried a peaceful word to theban cohorts crowded in their halls
1	and a thirteenth man besides , a scout we took — prowling along the ships , spying on our positions — hector and all his princely trojans sent him out
1	quickly , you and meriones shoulder up the body , carry it off the lines
1	agamemnon the lord of men did not resist
1	you ’ re dead set on my paying such a price ?
1	that moment , rumor , flown through the shaken camp , wings the news to the ears of euryalus ’ mother
1	then , when brilliant achilles had had his fill of tears and the longing for it had left his mind and body , he rose from his seat , raised the old man by the hand and filled with pity now for his gray head and gray beard , he spoke out winging words , flying straight to the heart : poor man , how much you have borne — pain to break the spirit !
1	i will give him a chariot , two horses with strong necks , the best of the breeds beside achaea 's fast ships
1	and five full circles they run and reel as many back , around and back , for it ’ s no mean trophy they ’ re sporting after now , they race for the life and the lifeblood of turnus
1	did it please you so , great jove , to see the world at war , the peoples clash that would later live in everlasting peace ?
1	before it rears a giant gate , its columns solid adamant , so no power of man , not even the gods themselves can root it out in war
1	now as we held our son between our hands and both our grieving faces , a tongue of fire , watch , flares up from the crown of iulus ’ head , a subtle flame licking his downy hair , feeding around the boy ’ s brow , and though it never harmed him , panicked , we rush to shake the flame from his curls and smother the holy fire , damp it down with water
1	a man who can cut out shafts and dress our wounds — a good healer is worth a troop of other men
1	since fortune ’ s got the upper hand , let ’ s follow her where she calls and change course
1	but once the olympians merged with mortal fighters , strife the mighty driver of armies rose in strength and athena bellowed her stunning war cry — standing now at the edge of the deep-dug trench outside the rampart , now at thundering cliffs she loosed her vibrant cry
1	not a single god or mortal , only thetis and eurynome knew — they saved me
1	but now , since i shall not return to my fatherland
1	their power 's enormous — one 's a master archer , pandarus , son of lycaon , so he boasts
1	they stood in a row
1	the most that valor could do , valor has done
1	i salute your ashes , your spirit and your shade—my father i rescued once , but all for nothing
1	— he will return them all and add from his own stores
1	i pray that the earth gape deep enough to take me down or the almighty father blast me with one bolt to the shades , the pale , glimmering shades in hell , the pit of night , before i dishonor you , my conscience , break your laws
1	father anchises calls out , land of welcome , that ’ s what you bring us , true , horses are armed for war , these pairs of horses threaten war
1	he 's just in the first flush of youth , what 's more , the greatest power of all
1	they are making a splendid sacrifice to the gods — i must not miss my share of the sacred feast
1	you too assume a captain ’ s joint command
1	bound by custom he slaughters a pair of yearling sheep , as many swine and a brace of young steers with their sleek black backs , then tipping wine from the bowls , he calls his father ’ s ghost , set free from acheron now , the great anchises ’ shade
1	raze them — whenever they stir the hatred in your heart
1	there are twin gates of sleep
1	with that he called his henchmen rout and terror to yoke his team as the god strapped on his shining gear
1	hecuba went down to a storeroom filled with scent and there they were , brocaded , beautiful robes
1	fight for your country — that is the best , the only omen !
1	oh but if zeus 's lightning blinded us those days , it 's zeus who drives us , hurls us on today !
1	the rampart 's down , there , the great wall we trusted , our impregnable shield for the ships and men themselves
1	kill us all in the light of day at least — since killing 's now your pleasure !
1	nothing they did could thrust him off their lines , prince hector roaring on like a torch — not even the picked athenians led by menestheus , peteos ' son and backing him came phidas , stichius , brave bias , then the epean units led by meges , phyleus ' son , amphion , dracius , and leading the phthian ranks came medon flanking podarces tough in skirmish
1	the man who would struck him down was not the weakest argive
1	another , numitor , wrenching out the shaft from his brother ’ s body , went at aeneas , praying to hit him , pay him back but not a chance of that—he could only graze the stalwart achates in the thigh
1	aeneas himself , sword drawn , slaughters a black-fleeced lamb to the furies ’ mother , night , and to her great sister , earth , and to you , proserpina , kills a barren heifer
1	many others afield are much taller , true , but i have never yet set eyes on one so regal , so majestic
1	no other achaean fighter could heft that shaft , only achilles had the skill to wield it well : pelian ash it was , a gift to his father peleus presented by chiron once , hewn on pelion 's crest to be the death of heroes
1	the shield-belt glinted silver and rippling on it ran a dark blue serpent , two heads coiling round a third , reared from a single neck and twisting left and right
1	now our whole army is no match for one , for hector — he will gut our ships with blazing fire at any moment !
1	men like pirithous , dryas , that fine captain , caeneus and exadius , and polyphemus , royal prince , and theseus , aegeus ' boy , a match for the immortals
1	and round camilla ride her elite companions , tulla , young larina , tarpeia brandishing high her brazen axe— daughters of italy , all , she chose to be her glory , godlike camilla ’ s aides in peace and war and wild as thracian amazons galloping , pounding along the thermodon ’ s banks , fighting in burnished gear around hippolyte , or when penthesilea born of mars comes sweeping home in her car , an army of women lifts their rolling , shrilling cries in welcome , exulting with half-moon shields
1	oh , child of heartbreak !
1	here are the pools where numicus ’ springs rise and here is the tiber river , here the hardy latins make their homes
1	deep in the sea she dove from radiant mount olympus
1	and with those words the goddess filled her heart with yearning warm and deep for her husband long ago , her city and her parents
1	who was the first they slaughtered , who the last , the brazen god of war and hector son of priam ?
1	my spirit rebels — i have lost the will to live , to take my stand in the world of men — unless , before all else , hector 's battered down by my spear and gasps away his life , the blood-price for patroclus , menoetius ' gallant son he 's killed and stripped !
1	look — what a mighty piece of work he 's done without me !
1	he closed with a shout and fired each fighter 's heart and down in a mass they launched against the trojans , ships around them echoing back their shattering cries
1	pain for achaeans , enough to last us down the years to come
1	and the many tribes report to join the dardan chief and his name rings far and wide through latian country
1	you with your coward 's heart , your men dying round you !
1	and he hangs his head low , humiliated in every way
1	achilles suddenly loosed a terrible , wrenching cry and his noble mother heard him , seated near her father , the old man of the sea in the salt green depths , and she cried out in turn
1	iris the wind-quick messenger hurried down to ilium , bearing her painful message , sent by storming zeus
1	they were enraged , they maimed him , they ripped away his voice , the rousing immortal wonder of his song and wiped all arts of harping from his mind
1	welcome , rousing words , and achaeans-at-arms roared out with joy to hear the greathearted achilles swearing off his rage
1	but teeming with treachery noble hera set her trap , 'you will prove a liar
1	even from the start of his declaration , she has glared at him askance , her eyes roving over him , head to foot , with a look of stony silence
1	three times i had to lay him low but my right hand , my right hand then , stripped him of all his lives and all his armor too !
1	so menelaus thrilled at heart — princely paris there , right before his eyes
1	isn ’ t that how the phrygian shepherd breached sparta and carried leda ’ s helen off to the towns of troy ?
1	you will hang your head in shame — every day of your life — if the argives strip my armor here at the anchored ships where i have gone down fighting
1	the genealogy of the royal house of troyno , wrapped in flames i would be up on the front lines , dragging the trojan into mortal combat
1	first you are , when you hear of feasts from me , when achaeans set out banquets for the chiefs
1	it 's not so much from anger or outrage at our people that i keep to my rooms so long
1	no , again and again you vowed you would make me godlike achilles ' lawful , wedded wife , you would sail me west in your warships , home to phthia and there with the myrmidons hold my marriage feast
1	but let them both bear witness to my loss
1	you are my child
1	if only they hated most all womankind so deeply !
1	so come , follow my orders
1	i say go back to the fighting , wounded as we are — we must , we have no choice
1	rejoice , relay our message , certain beyond all doubt , to your father full of years
1	we will put up another champion to go against this hector
1	so the voice of the king rang out in tears , the citizens wailed in answer , and noble hecuba led the wives of troy in a throbbing chant of sorrow : o my child — my desolation !
1	child of zeus with the shield of thunder , why come now ?
1	shattered , helpless , posted high on the turrets , girding walls with a thin defensive ring are asius , son of imbrasus , thymoetes , hicetaon ’ s son , the assaraci twins and castor with aged thymbris up in front : behind them , both sarpedon ’ s brothers , clarus and thaemon , new allies from lycia ’ s highlands
1	just to see the enemy camped in the very heart of our house , to see my son , ascanius , see my father , my wife , creusa , with them , sacrificed , massacred in each other ’ s blood ?
1	forward he ranged the charioteers with teams and cars , backed by infantry close behind them , milling , brave men , the defensive line of battle — that would be their role
1	and he leapt himself at the fighting driver 's corpse with the rushing lunge of a lion struck in the chest as he lays waste pens of cattle — his own lordly courage about to be his death
1	enough— allecto ignited in rage
1	a crack spearman — laomedon 's grandson , lampus ' big and brawny son , the strongest he sired , the best trained for assault — dolops quickly went for meges at close range , he speared his bulging shield but the solid breastplate warded off the blow with both plates fitted tight to bind his body
1	not even in death do their torments leave them , ever
1	put heads together — what shall we do now ?
1	but wait , i will bring you some honeyed , mellow wine
1	juno loved it , they say , beyond all other lands in the world , even beloved samos , second best
1	still he whipped an arrow high in the lofting air to display his seasoned art and make his bow ring out
1	three times he probed each way , three times juno with all her power held the prince ’ s fury down , pitying him in her heart , and kept him hard on course , cutting the deep as favoring tide and current sweep him home to his father daunus ’ ancient city
1	they received me from rhea , when thundering zeus drove cronus under the earth and the barren salt sea
1	the enemy ’ s sunken deep in sleep and wine , dead to the world
1	for the armies ' good the seer began to speak : achilles , dear to zeus
1	now , if the latin people must seek a son of strangers ’ stock , if that is fixed in stone and your father faunus ’ orders press you hard , well then i ’ d say all countries free of our rule are total strangers
1	the natural thing , my lord , men and women joined
1	today , either you ’ ll carry back those bloody arms we strip in triumph , parade aeneas ’ head and avenge together lausus ’ pains
1	now how can a trojan victory hinge on me ?
1	but you , you powers above , and you , jupiter , highest lord of the gods : pity , i implore you , a king of arcadia , hear a father ’ s prayers !
1	never scorn the gods
1	no hiding ourselves away in a horse ’ s blind dark flanks
1	when young dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more , they set sail for the main encampment of achaea
1	what have you to fear ?
1	turnus , truly beside himself with terror—faunus !
1	then the trojans throw themselves in the labor , launching their tall vessels down along the beach and the hull rubbed sleek with pitch floats high again
1	to you alone he used to listen , the traitor , to you confide his secret feelings
1	the son of tydeus killed the two of them on the spot , he ripped the dear life out of both and left their father tears and wrenching grief
1	and aphrodite who loves eternal laughter sobbed in answer , the son of tydeus stabbed me , diomedes , that overweening , insolent — all because i was bearing off my son from the fighting
1	well ahead of the war-cars they reached the brink , closed ranks as drivers backed them yards behind
1	to stand up bravely , always to fight in the front ranks of trojan soldiers , winning my father great glory , glory for myself
1	your friend , your sister , you scorn me now in death ?
1	these he will give , and along with them will go the one he took away at first , briseus ' daughter , and he will swear a solemn , binding oath in the bargain : he never mounted her bed , never once made love with her
1	there they loom in the gateway , left and right like towers , armored in iron , crests on their high heads flaring— tall as a pair of oaks along a stream in spate , by the po ’ s banks or the adige ’ s lovely waters , rearing their uncropped heads to the high sky , their twin crowns waving tall
1	tyrrhus rallies his troops , he ’ s just been splitting an oak in four with wedges ; now , breathing fury , he seizes a woodsman ’ s axe
1	where are we to settle ?
1	suddenly , in the heart of the woods , his mother crossed his path
1	oh but i , powerful juno , wife of jove , wretched juno , i endured it all , left nothing undared , i stooped to any tactic , still he defeats me—aeneas !
1	bend to your sturdy oars ! — and setting canvas aslant to work the wind , he calls out to his captain : great-hearted aeneas , no , not even if jove himself would pledge me with all his power , could i dream of reaching italy under skies like these
1	the death that each man dreaded turned to the fate of one poor soul : a burden they could bear
1	but not even then did hector quit the battle
1	he excelled all men in wealth and pride of place , he lorded the myrmidons , and mortal that he was , they gave the man an immortal goddess for a wife
1	son of a god , he will bring back the age of gold to the latian fields where saturn once held sway , expand his empire past the garamants and the indians to a land beyond the stars , beyond the wheel of the year , the course of the sun itself , where atlas bears the skies and turns on his shoulder the heavens studded with flaming stars
1	you two were busy over the carcass , carving meat when we both appeared and stood at the broad doors
1	calling out to the vision , zeus winged it on : go , murderous dream , to the fast achaean ships and once you reach agamemnon 's shelter rouse him , order him , word-for-word , exactly as i command
1	at that , queen juno looses her fury , bursting out : why drive me to break my deep silence , to open up my wounds , long scarred over , and bruit them to the world ?
1	and then , when the toddler had taken her first hesitant steps , metabus armed her hand with a well-honed lance and slung from her tiny shoulder bow and arrows
1	then to the king of the river styx , he raises altars into the dark night and over their fires lays whole carcasses of bulls and pours fat oil over their entrails flaming up
1	the famous spearman idomeneus crossed his path — he would come from a friend who just emerged from battle gashed in back of the kneecap , gouged by whetted bronze
1	ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , glory !
1	the argives poured against them , back by the hollow hulls , the din of battle incessant — an argive breakthrough — bright as the moment zeus the lord of lightning moves from a craggy mountain ridge a storm cloud massing dense and all the lookout peaks stand out and the jutting cliffs and the steep ravines and down from the high heavens bursts the boundless bright air
1	but here , achilles , accept this glorious armor , look , a gift from the god of fire — burnished bright , finer than any mortal has ever borne across his back !
1	only i — my hardened courage drove me to fight the man in a hot burst of daring , and i the youngest trooper of us all
1	and sighting odysseus next the old king questioned helen , come , dear child , tell me of that one too — now who is he ?
1	i will take him on myself , see who he is who routs us , wreaking havoc against us — cutting the legs from under squads of good brave men
1	courage , come , take heart !
1	i dread your grim commands
1	dido and troy ’ s commander make their way to the same cave for shelter now
1	and adding kills , she takes amastrus , hippotas ’ son , then attacking at long range , with spearcasts pierces tereus and harpalycus , then demophoön , chromis too and for every shaft the girl let fly from her hand another phrygian fighter bit the dust
1	that is the blood i claim , my royal birth
1	in hopes of ruling your stallion-breaking friends and filling priam 's throne ?
1	ten bands of blue enamel spanned it , spaced by twelve of gold and twenty of beaten tin and dark blue serpents writhed toward the throat , three each side , shimmering bright as rainbows arched on the clouds by cronus ' son , a sign to mortal men
1	no more delay , putting off the work the god puts in our hands
1	grant that achilles will receive me with kindness , mercy
1	then , at last , he hurtles into the thick of battle as mars drives him on , and terrible , savage , inciting slaughter , sparing none , he gives his rage free rein
1	the thought of my own dear father filled my mind when i saw the old king gasping out his life with that raw wound—both men were the same age— and the thought of my creusa , alone , abandoned , our house plundered , our little iulus ’ fate
1	come , relax your anger
1	but at once paris the lord of fair-haired helen drew his bow at the rugged captain diomedes
1	and the cry pierced menelaus , deeply torn now as he probed his own great heart : what can i do ?
1	but the argives faced them , standing fast in a ring around patroclus , one fury seizing their hearts , packing a wall of bronze shields and round about their glittering crested helmets now the son of cronus spread a dense , deepening mist
1	both men bent on combat , on they fought like wind when a god sends down some welcome blast to sailors desperate for it , worked to death at the polished oars , beating the heavy seas , their arms slack with the labor — so welcome that brace of men appeared to the trojans desperate for their captains
1	revere her power and she will grant safe passage
1	and here came nestor with orders ringing down the field : my comrades — fighting danaans , aides of ares — no plunder now !
1	vicious quarrels are deadly — put an end to them , at once
1	meanwhile aeneas is plowing out the city limits , assigning homes by lot
1	now , by heaven , i will arm and go to war
1	and thetis did not forget her son 's appeals
1	across from him patroclus sat alone , in silence , waiting for aeacus ' son to finish with his song
1	and zeus 's son sarpedon rejoiced to see him striding past and begged him in his pain , son of priam , do not leave me lying here , such easy prey for the danaans — protect me !
1	so runs the doom of zeus
1	wave on wave of them settling , close ranks shuddering into a dense , bristling glitter of shields and spears and helmets — quick as a ripple the west wind suddenly risen shudders down the sea and the deep sea swell goes dark beneath its force — so settling waves of trojan ranks and achaeans rippled down the plain
1	and the lord of men agamemnon came in last of all , weighed down by the wound he took in the rough charge when coon , son of antenor , slashed his arm with bronze
1	but all the while the rest of the trojans fled en masse , thrilled to reach the ramparts , crowding , swarming in , no daring left to remain outside the city walls and wait for each other , learn who made it through , who died in battle — no , in a driving rout they came , streaming into troy , any fighter whose racing legs could save his life
1	time and again you ’ ve heard his coming promised—caesar augustus !
1	they hold me off at a distance , all the souls , the shades of the burnt-out , breathless dead , never to let me cross the river , mingle with them
1	don ’ t let your corrosive grief devour you in silence , or let your dire concerns come pouring from your sweet lips and plaguing me forever
1	and the golden drovers kept the herd in line , four in all , with nine dogs at their heels , their paws flickering quickly — a savage roar !
1	one stir of the scent in the bronze-floored halls of zeus and a perfumed cloud would drift from heaven down to earth
1	so come , my boys , in honor of his heroic exploits crown your hair with leaves , hold high your cups , invoke the god we share with our new allies , offer him wine with all your eager hearts
1	dismayed by the signs , the king seeks out the oracle of faunus , his vatic father
1	they will never hold me back in my onslaught now , with a bound my team will leap that trench they dug
1	but she passed the rest and took a cup from themis , flushed with beauty , who ran to meet her first and hailed her now with winged words of welcome : hera , what brings you back ?
1	dead silence all around
1	a commission of yours taught me my lesson once , the day that heracles , the insolent son of zeus sailed out from troy , having razed her to the ground
1	they met on their feet
1	you can change an armada into sea-nymphs , yes , but if we in our turn offer the latin side a helping hand , is that such a horrid crime ?
1	always beside odysseus — just like the man 's mother , rushing to put his rivals in the dust
1	the gods who shored our empire up have left us , all have deserted their altars and their shrines
1	no more now — back i go to phthia
1	and worse still , the greeks roaring with anger—we had saved cassandra— attack us from all sides !
1	come , put your head down , steal some rest for your eyes worn out from labor
1	so standing tall , with their arms and fighting hearts refreshed— one who trusted all to his sword , the other looming fiercely with his spear—confronting each other , both men breathless , brace for the war-god ’ s fray
1	look at the heroes who ’ d seize our brides in battle !
1	and so he saved them all from the fatal day , he gave way to his own feelings , but too late
1	over there , where the massed infantry pushes forward , that ’ s where your famous land demands you back with pallas in the lead
1	he mounted his car at once as asclepius ' son , machaon born of the famous healer swung aboard
1	so mezentius now , for all his attackers ’ rightful fury , none of them has the spine to fight him , swords drawn , they just bait him with missiles , far-flung cries , all at a safe remove
1	is this what your pyre meant for me—this , your fires—this , your altars ?
1	aeneas spurs his men in the forefront of their labors , geared with the same woodsmen ’ s tools around his waist
1	all fell hushed , their eyes fixed on aeneas now as the founder of his people , high on a seat of honor , set out on his story : sorrow , unspeakable sorrow , my queen , you ask me to bring to life once more , how the greeks uprooted troy in all her power , our kingdom mourned forever
1	he broke off and anguish gripped achilles
1	thetis saved my life when the mortal pain came on me after my great fall , thanks to my mother 's will , that brazen bitch , she wanted to hide me — because i was a cripple
1	but other soldiers kept on flailing , cutting each other to pieces , the tough bronze casing their bodies clanging out , fighters stabbing with swords , flinging two-edged spears
1	first adrestus , then autonous , then echeclus , then perimus , megas ' son , epistor and melanippus , then in a flurry elasus , mulius and pylartes — he killed them all but the rest were bent on flight
1	you ’ d never think such a throng of men in bronze were massing for battle now , but high in the sky a cloud of birds with their raucous song were surging home from open sea to shore
1	but coon marked him , coon , antenor 's eldest son , a distinguished man-at-arms , and stinging grief went misting down his eyes for his fallen brother
1	seems to me it 's a new team out in front , a new driver as well , just coming into sight
1	shall i tell you of neoptolemus ’ brief reign ?
1	the hero seized his foot , dragging him through the rout
1	i have no use for trophies
1	but now as the twelfth dawn after this shone clear the gods who live forever marched home to olympus , all in a long cortege , and zeus led them on
1	i am no stranger to you
1	now let ajax take this victory , shining triumph !
1	now let those win out
1	the men of argos exulted at the sight of him there but terrible tremors shook each trojan fighter 's knees — hector himself , his heart pounding against his ribs
1	through fires , a thousand menacing spears i swept him off on these shoulders , saved him from our enemies ’ onslaught
1	so they roused each other , exulting in the fire , the joy of battle the god excited in their hearts
1	oh i will stop — if that is your command — but let your son stop too !
1	what shores do you come from ?
1	two bowls of unmixed wine he tips on the ground and two of fresh milk , two more of hallowed blood , then scatters crimson flowers with this prayer : hail , my blessed father , hail again !
1	the herald eumelus runs the news to crowds wedged in the theater round anchises ’ tomb— even they can see the black cloud churn with sparks
1	but you , patroclus , you would not let me weep , not when the swift achilles cut my husband down , not when he plundered the lordly mynes ' city — not even weep !
1	for the loser he led a woman through their midst , worth four , they thought , and skilled in many crafts
1	the sister , silvia , she is the first to call for rescue , hands beating her arms , summoning hardy rustics
1	but before i have to see my city annihilated , laid waste before my eyes — oh let me go down to the house of death !
1	his enemies massing round him , trying to drive him back , left , right but he keeps charging , harder , swirling his lightning sword till facing volcens , he sinks his blade in his screaming mouth— nisus dying just as he stripped his enemy of his life
1	beat the merciless day of death from ajax , overpowered , look , by a pelting rain of spears
1	first of the two to know the god was rapid ajax
1	it ’ s savagery , swordplay cut-and-thrust !
1	never sated with shattering war cries , are you ?
1	do his father aeneas and uncle hector fire his heart with the old courage , his heroic forebears ’ spirit ?
1	if i ever reach the tiber , the fields on tiber ’ s banks , and see my people secure behind their promised walls , then of our neighboring kin and kindred cities , both in epirus and hesperia—both have the same founder , dardanus , the same fate too—someday we will make our peoples one , one troy in heart and soul
1	but troy and her soaring ramparts were not standing yet , the people lived in valleys , deep in lowlands
1	the hounds shrank from sinking teeth in the lions , they balked , hunching close , barking , cringing away
1	not even then would the stark grief for heracles release my breaking heart — my own godlike son
1	and all those left alive , after the hateful carnage , remember food and drink — so all the more fiercely we can fight our enemies , nonstop , no mercy , durable as the bronze that wraps our bodies
1	a hundred years they wander , hovering round these shores till at last they may return and see once more the pools they long to cross
1	and there in the midst the king , scepter in hand at the head of the reaping-rows , stood tall in silence , rejoicing in his heart
1	and even if i were willing , would the trojans allow me to board their proud ships— a woman they hate ?
1	how shameful for you , the high and mighty commander , to lead the sons of achaea into bloody slaughter !
1	i would not be surprised , my queen , if you were the first to reap the pernicious whirlwind you have sown — i will whip you stroke on stroke
1	as a garden poppy , burst into red bloom , bends , drooping its head to one side , weighed down by its full seeds and a sudden spring shower , so gorgythion 's head fell limp over one shoulder , weighed down by his helmet
1	a last request — grant it , please
1	grant this boy , my son , may be like me , first in glory among the trojans , strong and brave like me , and rule all troy in power and one day let them say , 'he is a better man than his father !
1	but none as rapt as nestor , achaea 's watch and ward , who stretched his hands to the starry skies and prayed , father zeus !
1	mesthles and antiphus led maeonia 's proud contingent , talaemenes ' two sons sprung from the nymph of gyge lake led on maeonian units born and bred under mount tmolus
1	they are the very strain farseeing zeus gave tros , payment in full for stealing ganymede , tros 's son : the purest , strongest breed of all the stallions under the dawn and light of day
1	no , let her father pitch on some other argive — one who can please him , a greater king than i if the gods pull me through and i reach home alive , peleus needs no help to fetch a bride for me himself
1	athena rushed to achilles , her bright eyes gleaming , standing shoulder-to-shoulder , winging orders now : at last our hopes run high , my brilliant achilles — father zeus must love you — we will sweep great glory back to achaea 's fleet , we will kill this hector , mad as he is for battle !
1	aeneas the hunter , savage in all her nightmares , drives her mad with panic
1	no dardanus sired your line , you traitor , liar , no , mount caucasus fathered you on its flinty , rugged flanks and the tigers of hyrcania gave you their dugs to suck !
1	mercury lashes out at once : you , so now you lay foundation stones for the soaring walls of carthage !
1	so he decreed and phoebus did not neglect the father 's strong desires
1	i ’ ve spent all power of sea and sky against those trojans
1	you don the deathless arms of a great fighter — and all other fighters tremble before him , true , but you , you killed his comrade , gentle , strong , and against all rights you ripped the immortal armor off his head and shoulders
1	how long will he wait ?
1	there he stood up to me alone one day — and barely escaped my onslaught
1	but go i shall , to see my darling boy , to hear what grief has come to break his heart while he holds back from battle
1	pallas , awestruck by the famous name , cries out : come down onto dry land , whoever you are , speak with my father face-to-face
1	three times he tried to fling his arms around his neck , three times he embraced—nothing
1	the seasons loosed the purebred sleek-maned team , tethered them to their stalls , piled on ambrosia and leaned the chariot up against the polished walls that shimmered in the sun
1	but athena refused to hear theano 's prayers
1	rolling her eyes , fiery as he faltered , struggling to say more , she hurled the man back and reared twin snakes from her coiling hair and cracked her whips and raved in her rabid words : so , i ’ m in my dotage , am i ?
1	the god , look , the god !
1	he ruled budion 's fortress town in the old days but then , having killed some highborn cousin , fled to peleus and glistening thetis , begged for his own life and they sent him off with achilles , breaker of men , east to stallion-country to fight and die in troy
1	it ’ s your dotage , mother—you , you doddering wreck too spent to see the truth—that shakes you with anguish all for nothing now
1	mourn for his virtue !
1	the worst cowards , banded together , have their power but you and i have got the skill to fight their best !
1	look at your build
1	so hera trumpeted , lashing the nerve and fighting-fury in each man as athena , her eyes blazing , made for diomedes
1	that was the prince 's threat
1	that hour then and all day long till the sun went down they feasted and no god 's hunger lacked a share of the handsome banquet or the gorgeous lyre apollo struck or the muses singing voice to voice in choirs , their vibrant music rising
1	that day the olympians tried to chain him down , hera , poseidon lord of the sea , and pallas athena — you rushed to zeus , dear goddess , broke those chains , quickly ordered the hundred-hander to steep olympus , that monster whom the immortals call briareus
1	so he decreed and iris ran his message , racing with gale force to priam 's halls where cries and mourning met her
1	picture the wild boar that ’ s harried down from a ridge by snapping packs of hounds , some beast mount vesulus shielded for long or long the latian forests fed on the reeds that crowd their marshes : once stampeded into the nets he jolts to a halt , snorts , at bay , the hackles rising up on his neck , no hunter bold enough to approach him , take him on , at a safe remove they attack with spears and shouts
1	he scanned the achaean rampart : where could he find some chief , some captain to fight disaster off his men ?
1	their weapons are long , pointed stakes they like to fit with a supple thong for swifter hurling
1	ruling over us all from ida , god of greatness , god of glory !
1	you never deign , do you , freely and frankly , to share your plots with me — never , not a word !
1	defying the deathless gods they built that wall and so it stood there steadfast no long time
1	close to the spot , extending toward the horizon— the sibyl points them out—are the fields of mourning , that is the name they bear
1	and hebe washed him clean , dressed him in robes to warm his heart , and flanking the son of cronus down he sat , ares exultant in the glory of it all
1	all that i will unfold , i will recall how the battle first began
1	iris swept to a stop and once they saw her poised at the stone threshold all sprang up , each urged her to sit beside him but she refused , pressing on with her message : no time for sitting now
1	hephaestus built it , your own dear son , and the doors fit snug and tight
1	no hope of holding their ground outside their own city walls , despite superior numbers
1	even without that power his spear flies straight to the mark , never stops , not till it bores clean through some fighter 's flesh
1	they would have clashed at once and tried their luck in war but the ruddy sun has plunged his weary team in the western sea and as daylight slips away he brings the nightfall on
1	like diana urging her dancing troupes along the eurotas ’ banks or up mount cynthus ’ ridge as a thousand mountain-nymphs crowd in behind her , left and right—with quiver slung from her shoulder , taller than any other goddess as she goes striding on and silent latona thrills with joy too deep for words
1	and i told patroclus clearly , 'once you have beaten off the lethal fire , quick , come back to the ships — you must not battle hector !
1	crowds of trojans were mobbing his colonnades — he gave them a tongue-lashing , sent them packing : get out — you good-for-nothings , public disgraces !
1	all , from the first to lowest ranks of achaea 's troops , should hear his words and mark his counsel well
1	so tydides prayed and athena heard his prayer , put spring in his limbs , his feet , his fighting hands and close beside him winged him on with a flight of orders : now take heart , diomedes , fight it out with the trojans !
1	gory with its hideous feasts
1	lycon , flailing , chopped the horn of peneleos ' horsehair-crested helmet but round the socket the sword-blade smashed to bits — just as peneleos hacked his neck below the ear and the blade sank clean through , nothing held but a flap of skin , the head swung loose to the side as lycon slumped down to the ground
1	but glaucus was first , lord of lycia 's shieldsmen now , the first to turn and he killed the gallant bathycles , chalcon 's prize son who had made his home in hellas , excelling the myrmidons all in wealth and fortune
1	the king is far too strong — he will crush us all
1	the women of troy would scorn me down the years
1	if only after death
1	no sooner said than an instant peal of thunder crashes on the left and down from the sky a shooting star comes gliding , trailing a flaming torch to irradiate the night as it comes sweeping down
1	only a veteran steeled at heart could watch that struggle and still thrill with joy and never feel the terror
1	he rose before her now , he savored her name : hera — where are you rushing ?
1	if you honored me last time and heard my prayer and rained destruction down on all achaea 's ranks , now bring my prayer to pass once more
1	the shield of aeneas soon as turnus hoisted the banner of war from laurentum ’ s heights and the piercing trumpets blared , soon as he whipped his horses rearing for action , clashed his spear against his shield— passions rose at once , all latium stirred in frenzy to swear the oath , and young troops blazed for war
1	and bracing the captain , arm around his waist , he helped him toward his shelter
1	but rugged diomedes gave him a grim look : escape ?
1	what are you saying ?
1	and the men who held the land of apaesus and adrestia , men who held pityea , terea 's steep peaks — the units led by adrestus joined by amphius trim in linen corslet , the two good sons of merops out of percote harbor , merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts
1	so it was in the old days too
1	all his wounds sealed shut , wherever they struck
1	ah , to a short life you bore me , mother — mother , she was laothoe , aged altes ' daughter
1	but a god still holds his hands above me , even me
1	for years you ’ ve looked askance at the homes of rising carthage , feared our ramparts
1	they will never let him tear the rich fat from the oxen , all night long they stand their guard but the lion craves meat , he lunges in and in but his charges gain him nothing , thick-and-fast from their hardy hands the javelins rain down in his face , and waves of roaring torches — these the big cat fears , balking for all his rage , and at dawn he slinks away , his spirits dashed
1	for years to come , i think , they will remember the feud that flared between us both
1	and when they had put aside desire for food and drink the old man began to weave his counsel among them : nestor was first to speak — from the early days his plans and tactics always seemed the best
1	all for briseis his heart was breaking now
1	then still in tears , they rush to perform the sibyl ’ s orders , no delay , they strive to pile up trees , to build an altar-pyre rising to the skies
1	meriones a match for the rapid god of battles ran for the tent , seized a fine bronze lance and hot for action rushed to catch his captain
1	— even so — writhing in death till all you trojans pay for patroclus ' blood and the carnage of achaeans killed by the racing ships when i was out of action !
1	and he sped to the rear to stir more ranks of argives , men refreshing their strength against the fast ships , dead on their feet from the slogging work of war — and anguish caught their hearts to see the trojans , troops who had stormed their massive wall in force
1	the glory might even have gone to them at any moment , so intent was the god who grips and shakes the earth as he surged his argives on and the god surged too , adding his own immortal force in their defense
1	or beat him down at patroclus ' hands at last ?
1	and straightway up to her chamber hermes climbed , the healer , in secret , lay in her arms in love and the woman bore the god a radiant son , eudorus — lightning on his feet and a crack man of war
1	remember aurora , tithonus ’ wife , and nereus ’ daughter ?
1	no slim band of men could ever finish him off , that rippling killer , he stacked so many men atop the tear-soaked pyre
1	she departs the sky and leaves her cloud behind
1	tears filling his eyes , his strong voice choked
1	her torments multiply , over and over her passion surges back into heaving waves of rage— she keeps on brooding , obsessions roil her heart : and now , what shall i do ?
1	down poseidon dove and yoked his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car , his pair that raced the wind with their golden manes streaming on behind them , and strapping the golden armor round his body , seized his whip that coils lithe and gold and boarded his chariot launching up and out , skimming the waves , and over the swells they came , dolphins leaving their lairs to sport across his wake , leaping left and right — well they knew their lord
1	now down the stretch they come , the exhausted runners closing on the goal when all at once unlucky nisus skids on a slick of blood they ’ d chanced to spill , killing bullocks , soaking the turf and green grass surface , here the racer , elated—victory won—pressing the pace he stumbles , pitching face-first in the filthy dung and blood of victims
1	just keep your promise , troy , and if i can save you , you must save me too— if i reveal the truth and pay you back in full
1	with that vow she turned away from her son and faced and urged her sisters of the deep , now down you go in the ocean 's folding gulfs to visit father 's halls — the old man of the sea — and tell him all
1	next antilochus , watching thoon veer for a quick escape , sprang and stabbed him , slashing away the whole vein that runs the length of the back to reach the neck — he severed it , sheared it clear and the man went sprawling , back flat in the dust and stretching out both hands to his friends-in-arms
1	but white-armed hera flared at him in anger : yes , there would be some merit even in what you say , lord of the silver bow — if all you gods , in fact , would set achilles and hector high in equal honor
1	lord anchises stole from that fine stock — behind laomedon 's back , tros 's grandson and heir to tros 's teams — he put some mares to the lusty stallions once and they foaled him a run of six in his royal house
1	the man who brings the ransom can take away the body , if olympian zeus himself insists in all earnest
1	they admire aeneas ’ gifts , admire iulus now—the glowing face of the god and the god ’ s dissembling words—and helen ’ s gown and the veil adorned with a yellow acanthus border
1	he loosed the glittering belt and slipped it off and the loin-piece and the plated guard below it , gear the bronzesmiths made
1	never— pallas strikes this blow , pallas sacrifices you now , makes you pay the price with your own guilty blood !
1	so he urged and up from the earth they caught the body in their arms , hoisting it high above their heads with a great heave — and trojan forces crowding behind them shouted out when they saw the argive fighters lift the corpse
1	anywhere , any land you please , that ’ s all i want
1	we must steel our hearts
1	now father anchises , deep in a valley ’ s green recess , was passing among the souls secluded there , reviewing them , eagerly , on their way to the world of light above
1	so he said , planted there
1	routed like herds of cattle or big flocks of sheep when two wild beasts stampede them away in terror , suddenly pouncing down in their midst — pitch darkness , the shepherd off and gone — so the defenseless argives panicked , routed
1	and so i will try to tell you something
1	rank and file streamed behind and rushed like swarms of bees pouring out of a rocky hollow , burst on endless burst , bunched in clusters seething over the first spring blooms , dark hordes swirling into the air , this way , that way — so the many armed platoons from the ships and tents came marching on , close-file , along the deep wide beach to crowd the meeting grounds , and rumor , zeus 's crier , like wildfire blazing among them , whipped them on
1	this city i build—it ’ s yours
1	he clamped a hand on the draft mule and shouted , step right up and get it — whoever wants that cup !
1	then the powers spoke out to ease me of my anguish : all that apollo will predict if you return to delos , he tells you here , of his own free will he sends us here before your doors
1	above them a black rock—now , now slipping , teetering , watch , forever about to fall
1	no waiting for us , for rutulian sword and torch to strike their ships !
1	quivering , there it stuck , and the stricken womb came booming back from its depths with echoing groans
1	the great gods on high decree it so
1	waiting , plotting , the other stumbling toward him , stunned , wild to grasp his knees , wild with all his heart to escape his death and grueling black fate as the great achilles raised his massive spear , wild to run him through — he ducked , ran under the hurl and seized achilles ' knees as the spear shot past his back and stuck in the earth , still starved for human flesh
1	the old man was terrified
1	his father would not let him fight , ever , he was the youngest-born of all his sons — priam loved him most , the fastest runner of all but now the young fool , mad to display his speed , went dashing along the front to meet his death
1	so these men will never budge from the gates though they are only two defenders — not till they kill us all or we kill them !
1	with that he planted a heel against patroclus ' chest , wrenched his brazen spear from the wound , kicked him over , flat on his back , free and clear of the weapon
1	and the other sons of achaea , running up around him , crowded closer , all of them gazing wonder-struck at the build and marvelous , lithe beauty of hector
1	with him at my side we would go through fire and make it back alive — no one excels the mastermind of battle
1	never a thought of death weighs down your spirit now , yet death is right beside you
1	i ’ ve earned your trust , what ’ s more
1	now , both armed , they move out at once , and as they go an escort of ranking trojans , warriors young and old , sees them off at the gates with many prayers
1	help me , i beg you
1	imagine — i and achilles , wrangling over a girl , battling man-to-man
1	pray to yourselves in silence , so trojans can not hear — no , pray out loud !
1	no , mother , you are the one to pray
1	but teucer and ajax , aiming at him together , shot !
1	all that flow from the crests of ida down to breaking surf , the rhesus and the heptaporus , caresus and the rhodius , grenicus and aesepus , and the shining god scamander and simois ' tides where tons of oxhide shields and horned helmets tumbled deep in the river silt and a race of men who seemed half god , half mortal
1	till the hero meriones moved in where he sprawled , wrenched the spear from his corpse and the dark came shrouding down across his eyes
1	take me back to my black ship
1	and his mother wailed now , standing beside priam , weeping freely , loosing her robes with one hand and holding out her bare breast with the other , her words pouring forth in a flight of grief and tears : hector , my child !
1	and they , if they go running home to the land they love , then the two of us , i and sthenelus here will fight our way to the fixed doom of troy
1	all who join the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , who drink wine at the king 's expense and hold command of your own troops , your rank and fame from zeus !
1	a mighty king , raging against an inferior , is too strong
1	down at his feet he flung his useless helmet , the one he donned when he played at war , acting out mock battles
1	i will marry no daughter of agamemnon
1	so achilles groaned , deeply , crying out to his myrmidons , o my captains !
1	but make your left horse hug that post so close the hub of your well-turned wheel will almost seem to scrape the rock — just careful not to graze it !
1	and then as he gasped his last in flames from his riven chest she swept him up in a cyclone , impaled the man on a crag
1	he made all smooth along the rip of the hellespont and piled the endless beaches deep in sand again and once he had leveled the argives ' mighty wall he turned the rivers flowing back in their beds again where their fresh clear tides had run since time began
1	but opposing them at once , a mix of views and voices rises up for turnus
1	at once she saw the sea lord blustering strong in the war where men win glory , her own brother and husband 's brother too , and her heart raced with joy
1	the noble heralds brought on the victims marked for the gods to seal and bind the oaths
1	he shook his head as achilles briskly told his men and serving-women to make beds in the porch 's shelter , to lay down some heavy purple throws for the beds themselves and over them spread some blankets , thick woolly robes , a warm covering laid on top
1	throw our arms around each other , just for a moment — take some joy in the tears that numb the heart !
1	— you all went down to death on the same day
1	he never fed his nestlings in the end
1	how i feared the realm of libya might well do you harm !
1	that was our hope while fortune still smiled
1	they shook the dust from their manes and galloped off , speeding the fast chariot just where the armies clashed
1	one comes with his son , pallas , the other brings achates
1	but then polypoetes braced for battle took the weight and far as a seasoned herdsman flings his throwing staff , whirling in flight across his cows to keep them all in line — so far he outhurled the whole field
1	that man — if i could see him bound for the house of death , i could say my heart had forgot its wrenching grief !
1	where are their towns ?
1	— this howling din could drown the clearest voice
1	where are you running ?
1	my hackles bristled , voice choked in my throat , and my wife spoke out to ease me of my anguish : my dear husband , why so eager to give yourself to such mad flights of grief ?
1	and lashed with fear by their master 's angry voice they put on a surge , closing on them fast
1	chest out , meet your enemy head-on !
1	he assumes the form and features of old butes , armor-bearer , once , to dardan anchises , trusty guard of his gates until aeneas made him ascanius ’ aide
1	at that the prince of the battle cry complied with a high piercing shout that reached all troops : friends — lords of the argives , o my captains !
1	a small price to pay
1	when they had put aside desire for food and drink , nestor the noble old horseman spoke out first : marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , no more trading speeches now
1	haggard , helpless , there in our midst he stood , all eyes riveted on him now , and turning a wary glance at the lines of trojan troops he groaned and spoke : where can i find some refuge , where on land , on sea ?
1	what should he do ?
1	what does the great god want with me ?
1	achilles alone could ram it home himself
1	and the famous crippled smith forged a meadow deep in a shaded glen for shimmering flocks to graze , with shepherds ' steadings , well-roofed huts and sheepfolds
1	but halaesus hot for combat charges against them now , compressing all his force behind his weapons
1	how could you leave me all alone ? — so cruel !
1	who , noble cato , could pass you by in silence ?
1	see how the twin plumes stand joined on his helmet ?
1	and after him comes tullus disrupting his country ’ s peace to rouse a stagnant people , armies stale to the taste of triumph , back to war again
1	turning to leave , my tears brimmed and i said a last farewell : live on in your blessings , your destiny ’ s been won !
1	but there was a day i shone among the champions
1	and back apollo strode , a god in the wars of men while glorious hector ordered skilled cebriones , flog the team to battle !
1	and they leave behind a haul of soldiers ’ armor struck in solid silver , mixing-bowls in the bargain , gorgeous rugs
1	so , you ’ re not about to destroy us root and branch , not if you plant such courage , such resolve in our young soldiers ’ hearts
1	nestor the old driver gave them marching orders — a sharp glance at each , odysseus most of all : try hard now , bring him round — invincible achilles !
1	and there it rested
1	eumedes charges into the melee , grandson of old eumedes , bearing that veteran ’ s name but famed for his father dolon ’ s heart and hand in war
1	clear blue as the heavens , stream most loved by the gods who rule the sky
1	now i charged their lines like a black tornado , i captured fifty chariots there , and each time two men bit the dust , crushed beneath my spear
1	and now in a breakneck charge peneleos closed with lycon — they would missed each other with spears , two wasted casts , so now both clashed with swords
1	no — we are here on the plain of troy — all troy 's in arms !
1	round her beloved son her glistening arms went streaming , flinging her shining robe before him , only a fold but it blocked the weapons hurtling toward his body
1	they are hard for mortal men to curb or drive , for all but achilles — his mother is immortal
1	too much — like piling leaves or sand , and on and on they come , advancing across the plain to fight before our gates
1	soon they ’ re nearing the rock , swerving into the turn when gyas , holding the lead , still victor at mid-course , shouts out to his helmsman menoetes : where are you heading ?
1	i tell you this , so help me it 's the truth : if zeus with his storm-shield and queen athena ever let me plunder the strong walls of troy , you are the first , the first after myself — i will place some gift of honor in your hands , a tripod , or purebred team with their own car or a fine woman to mount and share your bed
1	flying before them now like clouds of crows or starlings screaming murder , seeing a falcon dive in for the kill , the hawk that wings grim death at smaller birds — so pursued by aeneas and hector argive fighters raced , screaming death-cries , lust for battle lost and masses of fine armor littered both sides of the trench as the argives fled in fear , no halt in the fighting , not now —
1	but he 's at the front , i am sure , engaging trojans , slashing his spear to save patroclus ' body
1	then you , glaucus , you fight for me with bronze !
1	counting on this , i planned my approach to you
1	aeneas commands the flooding crowds to clear the whole broad arena , leave the field wide open
1	off they scurry into the woods and trust to night
1	and then and there the achaeans might have taken troy , her towering gates toppling under patroclus ' power heading the vanguard , storming on with his spear
1	this strong cure , it ’ s none of the work of human skills , no expert ’ s arts in action
1	but brilliant achilles taunted hector 's body , dead as he was , die , die !
1	but the trojans swarmed like flame , like a whirlwind following hector son of priam blazing on nonstop , their war cries shattering , crying as one man — their hopes soaring to take the argive ships and slaughter all their best against the hulls
1	so , cloaked in folds of mist , they hide their feelings , waiting , hoping to see what luck their friends have found
1	he heard our pleas and replied with calming words : you happy , happy people , men of old ausonia , land where saturn ruled , what drives you now to shatter your blessed peace ?
1	if your commands will keep my pallas safe and if the fates intend to preserve my son , and if i live to see him , join him again , why then i pray for life— i can suffer any pain on earth
1	and loosing a heady laugh of triumph paris leapt from his hiding-place and shouted out in glory , now you are hit — no wasted shot , my winging arrow !
1	time to rest , to enjoy the sweet relief of sleep
1	all our lives are honed to the hard edge of steel , reversing our spears we spur our oxen ’ s flanks
1	so the immortals spun our lives that we , we wretched men live on to bear such torments — the gods live free of sorrows
1	here in another sector , mezentius—grim sight—is shaking a tuscan pine beam , hurling fire and smoky pitch at the foe as messapus , breaker of horses , neptune ’ s son , is ripping open a rampart , shouting : ladders—scale the walls !
1	most grasping man alive , how can the generous argives give you prizes now ?
1	but now by the beaked ships , far from your parents , glistening worms will wriggle through your flesh , once the dogs have had their fill of your naked corpse — though we have such stores of clothing laid up in the halls , fine things , a joy to the eye , the work of women 's hands
1	for the battles to come , hold back for now , dear boy !
1	we are not so dull of mind , we carthaginians here
1	if paris brings menelaus down in blood , he keeps helen himself and all her wealth and we sail home in our racing deep-sea ships
1	as he gasps out his last , his oblivious comrades leave him sprawled in the nameless dust and opis flies away to mount olympus
1	aeneas , achates , both were amazed , both struck with joy and fear
1	yes , hard as it was to uproot them once from tyre !
1	down through the bracing godsent night it came like good nestor in features , height and build , the old king himself , and hovering at my head the dream called me on : 'still asleep , agamemnon ?
1	if only an aide could speed the word to achilles
1	who keeps you from our embrace ?
1	at first he would trailed him a full discus-throw but now he was closing , gaining on him fast — yes , blaze with all her fury and flowing mane , agamemnon 's mare was coming on with a strong surge and now if the two teams had a longer course to run menelaus would have passed him — no dead heat about it
1	my son — does he still lie by the beached ships , or by now has the great achilles hacked him limb from limb and served him to his dogs ?
1	swerving off the trail they both lay facedown with the corpses now as dolon sped by at a dead run , the fool
1	when he saw his city stormed and seized , his gates wrenched apart , the enemy camped in his palace depths , the old man dons his armor long unused , he clamps it round his shoulders shaking with age and , all for nothing , straps his useless sword to his hip , then makes for the thick of battle , out to meet his death
1	agamemnon cried out too , calling men to arms and harnessed up in gleaming bronze himself
1	late in the day he ’ d chanced to come to troy incensed with a mad , burning love for cassandra : son-in-law to our king , he would rescue troy
1	it 's hard to fight the olympian strength for strength
1	at once the men arranged the sacrifice for apollo , making the cattle ring his well-built altar , then they rinsed their hands and took up barley
1	now you lack the daring to save him from the dogs
1	first , the winner , shall have a horse with dazzling trappings
1	she had climbed to pergamus heights and from that point she saw her beloved father swaying tall in the chariot , flanked by the herald , whose cry could rouse the city
1	we are denied the sailor ’ s right to shore— attacked , forbidden even a footing on your beach
1	they kept on urging the sharp-eyed giant-killer hermes to go and steal the body , a plan that pleased them all , but not hera , poseidon or the girl with blazing eyes
1	my father , anchises , whenever the darkness shrouds the earth in its dank shadows , whenever the stars go flaming up the sky , my father ’ s anxious ghost warns me in dreams and fills my heart with fear
1	and the glistening goddess moved among them now , seized achilles ' hand and urged him , spoke his name : my child , leave your friend to lie there dead — we must , though it breaks our hearts
1	and the greathearted achilles , flensing fat from all , wrapped the corpse with folds of it , head to foot , then heaped the flayed carcasses round patroclus
1	now up steps clausus from cures , flushed with his young strength and flings his burly spear from a distance , hitting dryops under the chin full force to choke the trojan ’ s throat as he shouted , cutting off both his voice and life in the same breath , and his brow slams the ground as he vomits clots of blood
1	the arrows clanged at his back as the god quaked with rage , the god himself on the march and down he came like night
1	go back to your own rank and file , i tell you !
1	just so madly turnus whips his horses into the heart of battle , chargers steaming sweat , trampling enemy fighters killed in agony—kicking gusts of bloody spray , their hoofs stamping into the sand the clotted gore
1	first the god commanded the great and little ajax , hungry for war as both men were already , ajax , ajax !
1	spirits high , consent to the pact i have decreed
1	or was it all a dream ?
1	my kin were glad to oblige and grant them their requests — till zeus changed our minds with a flash of bad omens
1	the one who wants her — step this way and try — he will have to fight me for her with his fists !
1	thymber—he lops off your head with one sweep of evander ’ s sword and , larides , chops your hand and the fighter ’ s dying hand gropes for its body , quivering fingers claw for the sword once more
1	pick my own comrade ?
1	does your courage really drive you to challenge me ?
1	nor had hector once got wind of the rampage
1	sweat from under the heavy buckler 's flat strap had rubbed him raw , he was chafed and his arm ached from lifting up the strap , wiping off the blood and the dark clots
1	what was the worst , most brazen thing he could do ?
1	i doubt he will keep from the fighting any longer , not with all his war-lust !
1	just past the city walls a grave-mound lies where an old shrine of forsaken ceres stands with an ancient cypress growing close beside it— our fathers ’ reverence kept it green for years
1	then lifting his rugged helmet he set it down on his brows , and the horsehair crest shone like a star and the waving golden plumes shook that hephaestus drove in bristling thick along its ridge
1	where ’ s juno in this ?
1	down he went , his corpse full length on the ground — just as achilles charged at piras ' handsome son , rhigmus who would sailed from the fertile soil of thrace — achilles pierced his belly , the bronze impaled his guts and out of his car he pitched as his driver areithous swung the horses round but achilles speared his back and the spearshaft heaved him off the chariot too and the panicked stallions bolted
1	no time for tears , not now , warned saturn ’ s daughter
1	for suddenly , just as the men tried to cross , a fatal bird-sign flashed before their eyes , an eagle flying high on the left across their front and clutching a monstrous bloody serpent in both talons , still alive , still struggling — it had not lost its fight , writhing back to strike it fanged the chest of its captor right beside the throat — and agonized by the bites the eagle flung it away to earth , dashed it down amidst the milling fighters , loosed a shriek and the bird veered off along the gusting wind
1	you gave me life , short as that life will be , so at least olympian zeus , thundering up on high , should give me honor — but now he gives me nothing
1	did you , my own father , dream that i could run away and desert you here ?
1	we ’ re rugged stock , from the start we take our young ones down to the river , toughen them in the bitter icy streams
1	she ’ s faint from loss of blood , her eyes failing , chill with death , and the glowing color she had , once , fades away
1	so all his shipmates gathered round his body and raised a loud lament , devoted aeneas in the lead
1	the mules in the lead hauled out the four-wheeled wagon , driven on by seasoned idaeus
1	hard as you scan the lines , there 's no more telling from which side we are harried — carnage left and right
1	sing to me now , you muses , you who hold olympus ' vaulting halls , how fire was first pitched on achaea 's ships !
1	a man heading out of the trojan camp !
1	an icy shiver runs through the trojans ’ sturdy spines and the king ’ s prayers come pouring from his heart : apollo , you always pitied the trojans ’ heavy labors !
1	let him set sail !
1	building her gorgeous city , doting on your wife
1	why , the long-haired achaeans must be roaring with laughter !
1	by the cruel seas i swear i felt no fear for myself to match my fear that your ship , stripped of her tiller , steersman wrenched away , might founder in that great surge
1	then off he sped himself with the speed of a darting hawk that soaring up from a sheer rock face , hovering high , swoops at the plain to harry larks and swallows — so the lord of the earthquake sped away from both
1	and once both armies had closed to a spearcast away they reined back to a halt— then abruptly surge forward , shouting , whipping their teams into combat frenzy , weapons pelting thick as a snowstorm shrouds the skies in darkness
1	so cacus , caught in that stunning flood of light , shut off in his hollow rock , howling as never before— hercules overwhelms him from high above , raining down all weapons he finds at hand , torn-off branches , rocks like millstones
1	your shelters overflow with the wine achaean ships bring in from thrace , daily , down the sea 's broad back
1	cebriones rushed to obey — but hector leapt down from the burnished car , he hit the earth with a yell , seized a rock and went for teucer , mad to strike the archer just plucking a bitter arrow from his quiver , notching it on the string and drawing back the bow to his right shoulder , when hector , helmet flashing , caught him where the collarbone bridges neck and chest , the deadliest spot of all
1	distraught with the rising anguish , atreus ' son went ranging back and forth , commanding heralds to sound out loud and clear and call the men to muster , each by name , but no loud outcry now
1	there , look , rearing against the lord poseidon phoebus apollo loomed , bristling winged arrows , rearing against ares , blazing-eyed athena , rearing against hera , artemis with arrow of gold and cry that halloos the hunt , the goddess raining shafts , huntress sister of phoebus the distant deadly archer — rearing against leto , hermes the running god of luck and against the fire-god rose the great deep-swirling river immortals call the xanthus , mankind calls scamander
1	how those hot-blooded epeans scattered in terror !
1	oh a goddess , without a doubt !
1	headlong ruin 's massing against us quickly
1	ground down by the war and driven back by fate , the greek captains had watched the years slip by until , helped by minerva ’ s superhuman skill , they built that mammoth horse , immense as a mountain , lining its ribs with ship timbers hewn from pine
1	then at the fourth assault patroclus like something superhuman — then , patroclus , the end of life came blazing up before you , yes , the lord apollo met you there in the heart of battle , the god , the terror !
1	the ghost of cassandra came to me in dreams , the prophetess gave me flaming brands and said : look for troy right here , your own home here !
1	but swear to apollo , wolf-god , glorious archer , you will slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs when you march home to zelea 's sacred city
1	give my son — he wo not live long — a shield and helmet and tooled greaves with ankle-straps and armor for his chest
1	force makes a breach and the greeks come storming through , butcher the sentries , flood the entire place with men-at-arms
1	but hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer , suddenly bursting out , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
1	achilles lets it go
1	if orpheus could summon up the ghost of his wife , trusting so to his thracian lyre and echoing strings ; if pollux could ransom his brother and share his death by turns , time and again traversing the same road up and down ; if theseus , mighty hercules—must i mention them ?
1	suddenly warmth drains from her grief-stricken body , the shuttle ’ s flung from her hand , the yarn unravels and off she flies , poor thing
1	your cup stands filled , always , brimmed like mine when the will stirs you to drink — so now drink deep of battle
1	i can see it now !
1	our oaths , our sworn truce — zeus the son of cronus throned in the clouds has brought them all to nothing and all the father decrees is death for both sides at once
1	he stood there a moment , stunned , then swinging his seven-ply oxhide shield behind him , drew back in caution , throwing a fast glance at his own achaean troops like a trapped beast , pivoting , backpedaling , step by short step
1	he left him there in place , heading for other chiefs
1	but the man who attacked you ?
1	intelligence fills their hearts , voice and strength their frames , from the deathless gods they have learned their works of hand
1	but mark my words
1	down she sank with ares , resistance quite dissolved , two immortals spread on the earth that rears us all with pallas trumpeting over them winged exultations : down you go !
1	please , themis , the white-armed goddess hera answered firmly , do not ask me to go through that ordeal again
1	a hushed silence held the ranks
1	heart writhing in pain , she climbed aboard the car and iris climbed beside her , seized the reins , whipped the team to a run and on the horses flew , holding nothing back
1	so he prays and choosing a pair of galleys from the fleet , he mans them both with rowers while fitting out his troops with battle gear
1	but i will suffer terrible grief for you , menelaus , if you die now , if you fill out your destiny now — and i go back to parching argos in disgrace
1	the great goddess fiery-eyed athena set him on , that fool — does not the son of tydeus know , down deep , the man who fights the gods does not live long ?
1	wait , take my advice and call a halt right here : no more battling with fiery-haired menelaus , pitting strength against strength in single combat — madness
1	grim reminder — he brandished the shaft and hurled with all his might but athena blew it back from achilles bent on glory — a quick light breath and the shaft flew back again to tall prince hector and fell before his feet
1	down the immortals launched to the field of action — their warring spirits split the gods two ways
1	i dread this murderous man — he will burst right through our walls
1	crowding thick-and-fast as the swarms of flies seething over the shepherds ' stalls in the first spring days when the buckets flood with milk — so many long-haired achaeans swarmed across the plain to confront the trojans , fired to smash their lines
1	burn them to ash , those phrygian chiefs encamped at ease along our lovely river , and all their painted ships !
1	aeneas takes delight in the goddess ’ gifts and the honor of it all as he runs his eyes across them piece by piece
1	now she ’ s calybe , aged priestess of juno ’ s temple , so she appears in the young king ’ s eyes and urges : turnus , how can you lie back and let your labors come to nothing ?
1	and patroclus gave ground , backing a good way off , clear of the deadly archer 's wrath
1	some hoisted up the enormous bier—sad service— their eyes averted , after their fathers ’ ways of old , and thrust the torch below
1	lost to the clan , lost to the hearth , lost to the old ways , that one who lusts for all the horrors of war with his own people
1	and quick as the god of war meriones led the way till they reached the front his captain pointed out
1	ah but i think you will find the work quite taxing
1	but grant one prayer
1	so he recoiled , shouting out to comrades , oh my friends , what fools we were to marvel at wondrous hector , what a spearman , we said , and what a daring fighter !
1	but the sacred images of our trojan household gods , those i ’ d saved from the fires that swept through troy
1	only a joke , and nothing more , but his words , once heard , first spelled an end of troubles
1	but now , father , i come back to you and your resolves
1	at that , the etruscan fighting ranks subsided , checked on the field of battle , struck with awe by the warnings of the gods
1	far from your birthplace , gyge lake where your father 's fine estate lies next to the hyllus stocked with fish and next to the whirling hermus !
1	or agamemnon ’ s orestes hounded off the stage , fleeing his mother armed with torches , black snakes , while blocking the doorway coil her furies of revenge
1	down through the vast clear air flies mercury , rowing his wings like oars and in a moment stands on libya ’ s shores , obeys commands and the will of god is done
1	also , father will give twelve women , beauties all , and a dozen captive soldiers , each in armor—more , whatever lands their king latinus claims for himself
1	a hushed silence went through all the achaean ranks , ashamed to refuse , afraid to take his challenge
1	overpowered in all his power , sprawled in the dust , achilles lay there , fallen
1	at once he orders them led out to the trojans , one for each , swift with their winging hoofs , decked in embroidered purple saddle-blankets , golden medallions dangling from their chests , their trappings gold , pure gold the bridle bits they champ between their teeth
1	go , quickly , carry my last commands to turnus : take over the fighting , free the town from trojans !
1	so juno appealed and venus did not oppose her , nodding in assent and smiling at all the guile she saw through
1	but devout aeneas mounds the tomb—an immense barrow crowned with the man ’ s own gear , his oar and trumpet— under a steep headland , called after the herald now and for all time to come it bears misenus ’ name
1	i would say an immortal came your way and gave you these
1	but poseidon surging in secret out of the gray surf went driving into the argive ranks and lashed them on , agonized for the fighters beaten down by trojans , and his churning outrage rose against great zeus
1	it ’ s fate that called you on to reach our shores
1	i do not tell you to match the leader 's speed , skilled diomedes ' team — look , athena herself just fired their pace and gave their master glory
1	their captain 's down , the first to storm our wall , the great sarpedon
1	why do you sport that bow , you spineless fool ?
1	the old man cinched it on whenever he would harness up , marching his men to war where fighters die — nestor gave no ground to withering old age
1	but the cunning driver , even handling slower horses , always watches the post , turns it close , never loses the first chance to relax his reins and stretch his pair but he holds them tight till then , eyes on the leader
1	but now not a single trojan flees his death , not one the gods hand over to me before your gates , none of all the trojans , sons of priam least of all !
1	i will strap on the brave achilles ' armor , burnished armor i stripped from strong patroclus when i killed him !
1	but his mother simply turned away to the palace
1	yet he ’ s less avid now , exulting less and less when his horses win the day
1	but hector — apollo stood by him and drove him on , disguised as phaenops , asius ' son abydos-born , dearest to hector of all his foreign guests
1	how can i fight against this dreadful omen ?
1	and zeus who gathers the breasting clouds assured her , hera — nothing to fear , no god or man will see us — i will wrap us round in a golden cloud so dense not even the sun 's rays , the sharpest eyes in the world , will pierce the mist and glimpse us making love !
1	still you must approach her oracle , beg the seer with prayers to chant her prophecies , all of her own accord , unlock her lips and sing with her own voice
1	reaching the old king 's side the crier roused him sharply : son of laomedon , rise up !
1	i confess it , anna , yes
1	her voice rang out in tears and the women wailed in answer , grief for patroclus calling forth each woman 's private sorrows
1	even so , i must tell you why i called you here
1	and the cretan captain idomeneus answered warmly , i know your style , your courage
1	so meges chopped at the crown of dolops ' bronze helmet , split its spiny ridge with a sharp cleaving spear and sheared away its bristling horsehair crest
1	what horrors i saw , a tragedy where i played a leading role myself
1	when zeus who loves the lightning mixes gifts for a man , now he meets with misfortune , now good times in turn
1	time and again i tamed the wild rage of sky and sea , the same on land—xanthus and simois be my witness— i cared for your aeneas
1	so now , i tell you , drop this anger for your son
1	i know in my soul i don ’ t deserve to suffer
1	so my hopes ride high that we can seize them now if you have the heart to join me
1	but if priam and priam 's sons refuse to pay , refuse me , agamemnon — with paris beaten down — then i myself will fight it out for the ransom , i will battle here to the end of our long war
1	an outright gift to atrides agamemnon and menelaus , euneus gave a shipment of wine , a thousand measures full
1	that gentle man , the soul of kindness to all while the man was still alive
1	there — before he could heft it — a sudden lunge and lycurgus ' spear had run him through the guts
1	screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath , fighters killing , fighters killed , and the ground streamed blood
1	from there he slipped away to his father 's house , struggling home from lemnos , but only eleven days he cheered his heart with friends
1	the people , the elders all demand that aeneas be recalled and men dispatched to tell him how the land lies
1	i beg you , apollo , heal this throbbing wound , lull the pain now , lend me power in battle — so i can rally our lycians , drive them into war and fight to save my comrade 's corpse myself
1	now where 's your sense ?
1	all people know the story , all at the earth ’ s edge , cut off where the rolling ocean pounds them back , and all whom the ruthless sun in the torrid zone , arching amidst the four cool zones of earth , sunders far from us
1	but strike a pact with me , swear you will defend me with all your heart , with words and strength of hand
1	anchors run from prows , the sterns line the shore
1	back to the ships , quick , or you will run for your life !
1	dark blood oozes out and fouls the soil with filth
1	but what olympian wished it so , who sent you down to bear such heavy labor ?
1	do you need me ?
1	i deserve more pity
1	he ran through ranks of achaeans armed in bronze , searching for brave machaon
1	but at that point he refused to beat disaster off — refused himself , that is — but he buckled his own armor round patroclus , sent him into battle with an army at his back
1	so now let diomedes , powerful as he is , be on his guard for fear a better soldier than you engage him — for fear his wife , aegialia , adrastus ' daughter , for all her self-control , will wail through the nights and wake her beloved servants out of sleep
1	he 's the one to do his achaean comrades proud , do himself proud too , if he comes through alive from the fight that waits him , dueling to the death
1	you can make brothers bound by love gear up for mutual slaughter , demolish a house with hatred , fill it to the roofs with scourges , funeral torches
1	he pitched from his car , the reins poured to the ground and on foot meriones grabbed them up in his hands , shouting out at idomeneus , whip them hard now !
1	let no one ’ s violence overwhelm your power here as a father to give his daughter to a man , an outstanding man , a marriage earned in full and sealed by pacts of peace that last forever
1	you , my sister , you were the first , won over by my tears , to pile these sorrows on my shoulders , mad as i was , to throw me into my enemy ’ s arms
1	queen juno has hardly wiped me from her mind
1	down he crashed — horror gripped the achaean armies
1	and hector rose and spoke between both sides : hear me — trojans , achaeans geared for combat !
1	and then he spots two men , grief-stricken and robbed of death ’ s last tribute : leucaspis and orontes , the lycian fleet ’ s commander
1	take briseis at once , his beauty briseis by the hand and bring her here
1	quicker than his command he calms the heaving seas , putting the clouds to rout and bringing back the sun
1	that would be the disgrace
1	what destiny hounds you on to visit these , these sunless homes of sorrow , harrowed lands ?
1	i shall bestow the gods and their sacred rites
1	why , she and her frenzy blinded zeus one time , highest , greatest of men and gods , they say : even father zeus !
1	once achilles had poured the wine and prayed to zeus , he returned to his shelter , stowed the cup in the chest then took his stand outside , his spirit yearning still to watch achaeans and trojans struggle to the death
1	he weeps as he speaks and draws from his shoulder-strap a sword of gold , forged by one lycaon of crete : marvelous work , fitted with ivory sheath and set for action
1	i must implore that terrible , violent man
1	and not a man came forward who did not stab his body , glancing toward a comrade , laughing : ah , look here — how much softer he is to handle now , this hector , than when he gutted our ships with roaring fire !
1	why , i lost a son of my own with all the rest—sarpedon
1	grant our return in glory back to the warships once we have done some feat that brings the trojans pain !
1	they can not hold me off any longer , these achaeans , not even massed like a wall against me here — they will crumble under my spear , well i know , if the best of immortals really drives me on , hera 's lord whose thunder drums the sky !
1	so they sing his praise , and to crown it sing of cacus ’ cave , the monster breathing fire , and all the woods resound with the ringing hymns , and the hillsides echo back
1	i throw myself on your mercy , whoever you may be
1	and fleeing orsilochus now as the trojan drives her round in a huge ring , camilla tricks him , wheeling inside him , quick , the pursuer now the pursued as she rears above him— praying , begging for mercy—her battle-axe smashes down , blow after blow through armor , bone , splitting his skull , warm brains from the wound go splashing down his face
1	whatever struggle is still to come , i ’ ll manage it myself
1	ah too bad , and i always thought you excelled the rest in sense , all who hale from lycia 's fertile soil
1	euryalus radiant , famed for the bloom of youth—nisus , for the pure love he devoted to the boy
1	thundering on , on like oxen broad in the brow some field hand yokes to crush white barley heaped on a well-laid threshing floor and the grain is husked out fast by the bellowing oxen 's hoofs — so as the great achilles rampaged on , his sharp-hoofed stallions trampled shields and corpses , axle under his chariot splashed with blood , blood on the handrails sweeping round the car , sprays of blood shooting up from the stallions ' hoofs and churning , whirling rims — and the son of peleus charioteering on to seize his glory , bloody filth splattering both strong arms , achilles ' invincible arms —
1	as mistletoe in the dead of winter ’ s icy forests leafs with life on a tree that never gave it birth , embracing the smooth trunk with its pale yellow bloom , so glowed the golden foliage against the ilex evergreen , so rustled the sheer gold leaf in the light breeze
1	a sudden rumor flies through the little town : horsemen are rushing toward the tuscan monarch ’ s gates !
1	that time , alone , apart from his men , he marched the message into thebes , filled with hordes of thebans , i told him to banquet in their halls and eat in peace
1	long before that the city will be sacked , plundered top to bottom !
1	and here , instantly struck with terror , aeneas grips his sword and offers its naked edge against them as they come , and if his experienced comrade had not warned him they are mere disembodied creatures , flimsy will-o ’ -the-wisps that flit like living forms , he would have rushed them all , slashed through empty phantoms with his blade
1	but just out of the turn , starting the homestretch back to sunlit sea the horses lunged , each driver showed his form , the whole field went racing full tilt and at once the fast mares of eumelus surged far out in front — and after him came diomedes ' team , tros 's stallions hardly a length behind now , closing at each stride and at any moment it seemed they would mount eumelus ' car , their hot breath steaming his back and broad shoulders , their heads hovering over him , breakneck on they flew — and now he would have passed him or forced a dead heat if apollo all of a sudden raging at diomedes had not knocked the shining whip from his fist
1	so nestor said and atrides ranged forward , glad at heart , and came on peteos ' son the charioteer menestheus standing idle , and circling him athenian men who could raise the cry of battle
1	as when some master tanner gives his crews the hide of a huge bull for stretching , the beast 's skin soaked in grease and the men grab hold , bracing round in a broad circle , tugging , stretching hard till the skin 's oils go dripping out as the grease sinks in , so many workers stretch the whole hide tough and taut — so back and forth in a cramped space they tugged , both sides dragging the corpse and hopes rising , trojans hoping to drag patroclus back to troy , achaeans to drag him back to the hollow ships and round him always the brutal struggle raging
1	little iulus , your father and your wife , so i once was called
1	what rough fortune has driven him to despair ?
1	in the front ranks he will sprawl , i think , torn open , a rout of his comrades down around their captain just as the sun goes rising into dawn
1	and you , my wife , most blessed woman in all the world , how lucky you were to die , spared this wrenching grief !
1	the lord of men spoke out from where he stood : my friends , fighting danaans , aides of ares
1	cowering backward fast the trojans gave ground , hector , aeneas and chromius , noble prince , deserted aretus there , his life torn out , sprawled on the spot
1	the burdens of old age already weigh you down
1	wherever he fought to force his way , no luck , the merciless fury blocks his efforts
1	so this , he thinks , is the man foretold by fate
1	but he caught his breath again
1	but a light urging sent by the god of earthquakes rippled through their lines and whipped battalions on
1	already arcadian horsemen flanked by strong etruscans hold assigned positions
1	here was the ugliest man who ever came to troy
1	no , you colossal , shameless — we all followed you , to please you , to fight for you , to win your honor back from the trojans — menelaus and you , you dog-face !
1	so ajax drew back , out of range , and then — they flung their tireless fire at a fast trim ship
1	you deceived me all along ?
1	up to the sky an immense billow hoists us , then at once , as the wave sank down , down we plunge to the pit of hell
1	so visitors may depart , deprived of her advice , and hate the sibyl ’ s haunts
1	he cuts down lamyrus too , lamus and serranus—well-built soldier , he ’ d gamed away till late at night and now lay numb in a drunken haze
1	or have you forgot the time i caught you all alone , i cut you off from your flocks and sent you scurrying down the slopes of ida ?
1	call machaon here , the son of asclepius , that unfailing healer , to see to menelaus , atreus ' fighting son
1	you led me through many seas , bordering endless coasts , far-off massylian tribes , and fields washed by the syrtes , and now , at long last , italy ’ s shores , forever fading , lie within our grasp
1	you never forget my friendship , never miss a chance to pay me the honor i deserve among our comrades
1	i would never give them a glance , a second thought , whether they fly on the right toward the dawn and sunrise or fly on the left toward the haze and coming dark !
1	next , mnestheus , flushed with victory in the ships , his brow still crowned with an olive wreath of green
1	and there her proud , mettlesome charger prances in gold and royal purple , pawing with thunder-hoofs , champing a foam-flecked bit
1	a dizzying swirl of anguish rushing down his eyes , blind with fear , the point had stuck so close
1	what becomes of them now , the pacts and oaths we swore ?
1	look at ajax now , with only a few years on me
1	that much respite and breathing room had ilus won—at ilus pallas had flung a rugged spear at long range , but rhoeteus pausing between them takes the point head-on as he flees from you , distinguished teuthras , you and your brother tyres— rhoeteus spilling out of his car in death-throes , drumming the fields of italy with his heels
1	aeneas , glad that the ship is salvaged , crew restored , gives sergestus the prize that he had promised : a slave girl , pholoë , born of cretan stock and hardly inept at minerva ’ s works of hand , nursing twins at her breast
1	so you , you strap my splendid armor on your back , you lead our battle-hungry myrmidons into action !
1	three times now the horns of the moon have filled with light since i ’ ve dragged out my lonely days through the woods , where only the wild things have their dens and lairs , and watched from a lookout crag for the giant cyclops , quaking to hear their rumbling tread , their shouts
1	more , if they have the crews
1	— or heading home to troy , now they have trounced our armies ?
1	safer by far , you find , to foray all through camp , commandeering the prize of any man who speaks against you
1	now straight through the great gates she drove the team , whipping them on full tilt until they came to zeus the son of cronus sitting far from the other gods , throned on the topmost crag of rugged ridged olympus
1	by now the day had slipped from the sky and the gentle moon was riding high through the heavens at mid-career , her horses pounding through the night
1	you could not tell — did he rampage now with the trojans or the argives ?
1	this terrible sorrow : since i saw it coming , anna , i can endure it now
1	whom do you flee ?
1	strong vow — and they bore straight down on the argives full force , shaking their spears , their hearts fired with hopes of dragging patroclus ' body out from under ajax — fools !
1	he subsided but hera the queen , her eyes wider , was terrified
1	lift your hands to zeus , you whip an arrow against that man , whoever he is who routs us , wreaking havoc against us , cutting the legs from under squads of good brave men
1	the next day , when the sun ’ s first torch had flared across the earth , taking different routes they explore the town , the borderlands and coasts these people hold
1	over the corpse he would cut down crowds of men , though now , at this point , ajax warned menelaus , lord of the battle cry , old friend , my prince , i lose hope that we alone , on our own power , can make it back from the fighting
1	there follows an army of mourners , trojans all , and all the tuscans , all the arcadians march with arms reversed
1	and now i see them all , the fiery-eyed achaeans , i know them all by heart , and i could tell their names
1	if by chance the victory goes to the latin , turnus , we agree the defeated will depart to evander ’ s city , iulus will leave this land
1	oh make me young again , and the strength inside me steady as a rock !
1	a crack of the whip — the goddess hera lashed the team , and all on their own force the gates of heaven thundered open , kept by the seasons , guards of the vaulting sky and olympus heights empowered to spread the massing clouds or close them round once more
1	the house of idomeneus tumbled to the ground ?
1	i tried to tear some green shoots from the brush to make a canopy for the altar with leafy boughs , when a dreadful , ghastly sight , too strange for words , strikes my eyes
1	too bad , my friend , said ajax
1	hera held them back , still enraged as she was
1	first he went for the mules and circling dogs but then , launching a piercing shaft at the men themselves , he cut them down in droves — and the corpse-fires burned on , night and day , no end in sight
1	but her father , son of cronus , hugged her tight and giving a low warm laugh inquired gently , who has abused you now , dear child , tell me , who of the sons of heaven so unfeeling , cruel ?
1	my father , tydeus , i really do not remember
1	forbidden before this to defile its crest in dust , it guarded the head and handsome brow of a god , a man like a god , achilles
1	the rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship
1	and now , spurred by his comrades ' quick approval , achilles was just about to give the man the mare when antilochus , son of magnanimous old nestor , leapt to his feet and lodged a formal protest : achilles — i will be furious if you carry out that plan !
1	so she cries before the entrance—suddenly all her features , all her color changes , her braided hair flies loose and her breast heaves , her heart bursts with frenzy , she seems to rise in height , the ring of her voice no longer human—the breath , the power of god comes closer , closer
1	and high in the clear sky zeus himself defended his champion — hector alone he prized and glorified among hordes of men for hector 's life would be cut short so soon
1	but soon as a spear or bowshot wounds the king and atrides mounts his chariot once again — then zeus will hand you the power to kill and kill till you cut your way to the benched ships and the sun sinks and the blessed darkness sweeps across the earth !
1	there is a harbor clear of the wind , and spacious , calm , a haven , but etna rumbles , hard by , showering deadly scree and now it heaves into the sky a thundering dark cloud , a whirlwind pitch-black with smoke and red-hot coals and it hurls up huge balls of fire that lap the stars— and now it vomits rocks ripped from the mountain ’ s bowels erupting lava into the air , enormous molten boulders , groaning magma roiling up from its bedrock depths
1	with good will to the chiefs he rose and spoke , great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon
1	she will provoke me , she with her shrill abuse
1	where has it gone , goddess , the trust you lodged in me ?
1	but reclining just beside them , the oldest fury holds back their hands from even touching the food , surging up with her brandished torch and deafening screams
1	but as father zeus caught sight of them from ida the god broke into a sudden rage and summoned iris to run a message on with a rush of golden wings : quick on your way now , iris , shear the wind !
1	achilles broke in quickly — how can i go to war ?
1	never , never again will he have the nerve to test my fighting power — even now he was glad to save himself from death
1	there is nothing alive more agonized than man of all that breathe and crawl across the earth
1	they slew oxen beside the tents and took their meal
1	but when odysseus sprang up , the famed tactician would just stand there , staring down , hard , his eyes fixed on the ground , never shifting his scepter back and forth , clutching it stiff and still like a mindless man
1	that man — i can not see him — the one i hurled at , wild to cut him down
1	no , the pressure of combat locked them head-to-head , lunging like wolves , and strife with wild groans exulted to see them , glaring down at the melee , strife alone of immortals hovering over fighters
1	it 's not my nature to shrink from battle , cringe in fear with the fighting strength still steady in my chest
1	the famous spearman idomeneus cut him down
1	so let me seize my glory among the trojans now — or i will spear you too , i will rip your own sweet life away !
1	now , so long as the battle-hungry meleager fought , it was deadly going for the curetes
1	so on they fought like a swirl of living fire — you could not say if the sun and moon still stood secure , so dense the battle-haze that engulfed the brave who stood their ground around patroclus ' body
1	straight at the gates he lashed his team , hell-bent , his troops crowding behind him shouting war cries , never thinking the argive line could still hold out — they would all be hurled back on their blackened hulls
1	the renowned spearman idomeneus led them all in force with meriones who butchered men like the god of war himself
1	and one day we shall lift your children to the stars and exalt your city ’ s power
1	oh , my country , gods of the hearth we tore from enemies , all for nothing , will no walls ever again be called the walls of troy ?
1	here the man stands over all achaea 's armies , our rugged bulwark braced for shocks of war
1	vaunting , aflash in arms , hector swept through the gates with his brother paris keeping pace beside him
1	with such thanks , swinging his spear around he strikes home at the mountain ’ s hollow flank and out charge the winds through the breach he ’ d made , like armies on attack in a blasting whirlwind tearing through the earth
1	dardan fighters hand-to-hand — now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
1	but he wept freely now as his feet swept him clear of the close fighting , bearing the dreadful news to peleus ' son achilles
1	his men marveled too , trading startled glances
1	and the old man , rushing to climb aboard his chariot , drove out through the gates and echoing colonnades
1	so over the driver here and both claw-mad for battle , patroclus son of menoetius , hector ablaze for glory strained to slash each other with ruthless bronze
1	even look at me ?
1	my ships are lying moored in the tuscan sea
1	down she plunged to the bottom fast as a lead weight sheathed in a glinting lure of wild bull 's horn , bearing hooked death to the ravenous fish
1	but the plowland here will rot your bones , my brother , as you lie dead in troy , your mission left unfinished
1	now the trumpets blare
1	they skinned the animal quickly , butchered the carcass , expertly cut the meat into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
1	don ’ t hunger to know their doom , what form of torture or twist of fortune drags them down
1	adamas , asius , both sprawled at achaea 's sterns , dead at the argives ' hands
1	this polydorus : the doomed priam had once dispatched him in secret , bearing a great weight of gold , to be maintained by the king of thrace when priam lost his faith in trojan arms and saw his city gripped by siege
1	he seized the wand that enchants the eyes of men whenever hermes wants , or wakes them up from sleep
1	whenever i am bent on tearing down some city filled with men you love — to please myself — never attempt to thwart my fury , hera , give me my way
1	but once achilles has met his death , his certain doom , take courage then , go fight on the front lines then — no other achaean can bring you down in war
1	that was the cry that fired each soldier 's heart
1	shut out in front of their parents ’ faces , eyes streaming tears , some pitch headlong into the trenches , pressed by the rout , some charge wildly , reins flying , ramming the gateways blocked by the rugged posts
1	look , the ocean shuts us in with immense blockades of waves , no land to fly to !
1	we stand at the altar , heads under trojan veils , and following helenus ’ orders first and foremost , duly burn our offerings , just as bidden , to juno , queen of argos
1	man to man they fight and the weapons luck first brought are dyed with fresh blood now
1	— and fling their lust for battle to the winds
1	but if my forces are not enough , i am hardly the one to relent , i ’ ll plead for the help i need , wherever it may be— if i can not sway the heavens , i ’ ll wake the powers of hell !
1	and zeus who marshals the thunderheads returned , maddening one
1	so the men were engaged throughout the camp
1	clasping aeneas ’ right hand , he held it long and heading up to the grove they leave the river
1	and there is paullus , and he will rout all argos and agamemnon ’ s own mycenae and cut perseus down— the heir of aeacus , born of achilles ’ warrior blood— and avenge his trojan kin and minerva ’ s violated shrine
1	and peteos ' son menestheus cringed to see them heading straight for his bastion , hurling ruin on
1	how could anyone—man or god—force your aeneas to pitch on war , to harry king latinus as his foe ?
1	i embrace it , i recognize the gods !
1	but i can not bear to see you agonize so long
1	he found prince hector , the son of wise king priam , sitting up now , sprawled on the ground no longer , just regaining his strength , just beginning to recognize his comrades round about him
1	all pulled up abreast as achilles pointed out the post , far off on the level plain , and stationed there beside it an umpire , old lord phoenix , his father 's aide-in-arms , to mark the field at the turn and make a true report
1	and no spirits may be conveyed across the horrendous banks and hoarse , roaring flood until their bones are buried , and they rest in peace
1	uphill , downhill , crisscross , zigzag on they tramped and once they reached the slopes of ida with all her springs , quickly pitching themselves at towering , leaf-crowned oaks , they put their backs into strokes of the whetted bronze axes and huge trunks came crashing down
1	all at once on the left flank he marked him , spurring companions , urging them to fight , for phoebus had filled each man with quaking fear
1	the captains of athens , stichius , staunch menestheus , bore amphimachus back to achaea 's waiting lines
1	you can see them streaming out of the whole city , men like ants that , wary of winter ’ s onset , pillage some huge pile of wheat to store away in their grange and their army ’ s long black line goes marching through the field , trundling their spoils down some cramped , grassy track
1	at last the armies clashed at one strategic point , they slammed their shields together , pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields pounded , boss on welded boss , and the sound of struggle roared and rocked the earth
1	impossible now to pick you out , my captains , man by man — the battle blazes up so wildly
1	i can just make out the ramparts forged by the cyclops
1	i go all-out as it is
1	all the hopes of the greeks , their firm faith in a war they ’ d launched themselves had always hinged on pallas athena ’ s help
1	but i have little hope he will come at all — for all his rage at hector
1	may the gods who hold the halls of olympus give you priam 's city to plunder , then safe passage home
1	his immense limbs collapse , and earth groans as his giant shield thunders down on his body
1	not even the thought of dido doomed to a cruel death ?
1	what of those gallant men who backed my sword and me ?
1	if a man obeys the gods they are quick to hear his prayers
1	i ’ d never have come if fate had not ordained me here a house and home
1	so thersites taunted the famous field marshal
1	this was juno ’ s fear and the goddess never forgot the old campaign that she had waged at troy for her beloved argos
1	when she sees latinus steeling himself against her , when the serpent ’ s crazing venom has sunk into her flesh , the fever raging through her entire body , then indeed the unlucky queen , whipped insane by ghastly horrors , raves in her frenzy all throughout the city
1	they send venulus out to great diomedes ’ city to seek reserves and announce that trojan ranks encamp in latium : aeneas arrives with his armada , bringing the conquered household gods of troy , claiming himself a king demanded now by fate
1	the fleet goes skimming over the whitecaps now , the men rejoicing to wheel their prows around to a coast they know , at last
1	then will the violent centuries , battles set aside , grow gentle , kind
1	look at this ugly wound — my whole arm rings with the stabbing pangs , the blood wo not clot , my shoulder 's a dead weight
1	so fighters worked away in the grim shocks of war
1	now he lies on the ground — his heart is breaking
1	not even the leopard 's fury makes the beast so proud , not even the lion 's , not the murderous wild boar 's , the greatest pride of all , bursting the boar 's chest — they are nothing next to the pride of panthous ' sons with their strong ashen spears
1	and so do i , by god !
1	and now his retinue rises in all their forms , enormous beasts of the deep , the veteran troupe of glaucus , ino ’ s son palaemon , wind-swift tritons , phorcus ’ army in full force with thetis , melite , virgin panopea out on the left , fair-isle , sea-cave , spray , and the waves ’ embrace
1	she ’ ll ride like a queen in triumph with her trophies ?
1	i ’ m here to die , but i bring you these gifts first !
1	flown off to the sky on wings or they roam the streams , as birds—how brutal , the punishments all my people have endured— and they make the cliffs re-echo with their cries
1	so now we plan how the war will all work out : do we rouse the pain and grisly fighting once again or hand down pacts of peace between both armies ?
1	murranus—no one dearer to me survived , a great soldier taken down by a great wound
1	no more sidling up to me , whining here before me
1	strong as you are — a goddess was your mother — he has more power because he rules more men
1	i tell you this , and i swear a mighty oath upon it
1	my poor people , you will pay for your outrage with your blood
1	i have learned it all too well
1	now , as soon as the others reached nestor 's tent they climbed down on the earth that feeds us all
1	i am off to the ends of the fruitful , teeming earth to visit ocean , fountainhead of the gods , and mother tethys who nourished me in their halls and reared me well
1	the trojans spot it , and first from the landward wall caicus calls out : what ’ s that mass , my countrymen , blackness rolling toward us ?
1	change yourself into any shape you please , call up whatever courage or skill you still have left
1	sheltered under his curving , beaked ships he found him , foreboding , deep down , all that had come to pass
1	now hector , dear to zeus , strode through the gates , clutching a thrusting-lance eleven forearms long ; the bronze tip of the weapon shone before him , ringed with a golden hoop to grip the shaft
1	poor lost fool , can ’ t you sense it , grasp it yet—the treachery of laomedon ’ s breed ?
1	hera went to the massed ships with pallas athena , poseidon who grips the earth , and hermes god of luck who excels them all at subtle twists and tactics — and the god of fire flanked them , seething power , hobbling along but his shrunken legs moved nimbly
1	you will bring a ray of hope to your men , your father too
1	come , let us keep clear of each other 's spears , even there in the thick of battle
1	ah but now , quite exposed , far from troy they battle around our hollow ships , thanks to our leader 's weakness , our armies ' slacking off
1	down from the temple roof come showers of lances hurled by our own comrades there , duped by the look of our greek arms , our greek crests that launched this grisly slaughter
1	none that touch me
1	fresh as the day we fought by celadon 's rapids , our pylians in platoons against arcadian spearmen under phia 's ramparts , round the iardanus ' banks
1	danaë once , they say , swept ashore by a southern gale , built that town for her father ’ s settlers , king acrisius
1	anna heard and , stunned , breathless with terror , raced through the crowd , her nails clawing her face , fists beating her breast , crying out to her sister now at the edge of death : was it all for this , my sister ?
1	so i may know , too well , just how cruelly i am the most dishonored goddess of them all
1	and discord surges up in the panic-stricken citizens , some insisting the gates be flung wide to the dardans , yes , and they hale the king himself toward the walls
1	stroking one of the argive women 's rippling gowns she 's pricked her limp wrist on a golden pinpoint !
1	you will make the crisis worse at any moment with this , this hanging back
1	but not a moment more would he turn his shining eyes to troy
1	down to the shore we go to take them on
1	eurypylus , hero , what shall we do ?
1	both seized their lances , wrenched them from the shields and went for each other now like lions rending flesh or a pair of wild boars whose power never flags
1	pirous who heaved the rock came rushing in and speared him up the navel — his bowels uncoiled , spilling loose on the ground and the dark came swirling down across his eyes
1	but hector , at least , will never ride behind you , you and your blazoned chariot
1	flat on his back he went , slamming against the ground and his killer stripped the armor brazen ares gave him
1	look , the sharp stakes jutting right at the edge , and just beyond that the achaeans ' sturdy rampart
1	drag it inside the walls , he urges , plant it high on the city heights !
1	as a lion charges cattle , calves and heifers browsing the deep glades and snaps their necks , so tydides pitched them both from the chariot , gave them a mauling — gave them little choice — quickly stripped their gear and passed their team to his men to lash back to the ships
1	my limbs are gnarled now , the old power 's gone
1	their fleet is massed on the shore and a low roar grows , men crying for battle-standards now , but an aged prophet holds them back , singing out his song of destiny : you elite lydian troops , fine flower of courage born of an ancient race , oh , what just resentment whips you into battle !
1	here dardanus was born
1	so odysseus prayed and hoisting the spoils over his head , heaved them onto a tamarisk bush nearby and against it heaped a good clear landmark , clumping together reeds and fresh tamarisk boughs they would never miss as they ran back through the rushing dark night
1	tomorrow i will return to you with the rising sun , bearing splendid arms from hephaestus , god of fire !
1	the victor king was still building his city , argyripa , named for his father ’ s argive stock— in iapyx ’ realm , the fields round mount garganus
1	nor do i make war with your people
1	so either side of the lines they took positions , weighing tactics , each olympian force reluctant now to launch out first on the wrenching horrors of war
1	this day first gave you to war and this day takes you off and still you leave behind great heaps of latian dead
1	so intense , that iulus was first to welcome both , inviting hyrtacus ’ son to speak , and so he did : men of aeneas , hear us out with open minds , don ’ t judge what we say by our young years
1	follow us , come , so we can wake the next man , some captain fit to map our strategy here , whether we break and run or stand and fight
1	lucky man , if only he ’ d stretched his gambling through the night and played it out till dawn !
1	now zeus hands us a day worth all the rest , today we seize these ships — they stormed ashore against the will of the gods , they came here freighted with years of pain for us , and all thanks to our city elders
1	the driver eurymedon freed the old man 's team
1	bring that man into range and let me spear him !
1	next in the offing acragas rears , steep city , once a famous breeder of fiery steeds , and shows its mighty ramparts
1	and i , i last of all — the dogs before my doors will eat me raw , once some enemy brings me down with his sharp bronze sword or spits me with a spear , wrenching the life out of my body , yes , the very dogs i bred in my own halls to share my table , guard my gates — mad , rabid at heart they will lap their master 's blood and loll before my doors
1	the noble son of hippolochus answered staunchly , high-hearted son of tydeus , why ask about my birth ?
1	— with what a load of misery lifted from my spirit
1	just as the sun began to strike the plowlands , rising out of the deep calm flow of the ocean river to climb the vaulting sky , the opposing armies met
1	now if he heard how all cringe in the face of hector , time and again he would stretch his hands to the gods and pray that life breath would quit his limbs and sink to the house of death
1	and iris racing the wind went veering off as achilles , zeus 's favorite fighter , rose up now and over his powerful shoulder pallas slung the shield , the tremendous storm-shield with all its tassels flaring — and crowning his head the goddess swept a golden cloud and from it she lit a fire to blaze across the field
1	hector aflash in arms took up his horsehair-crested helmet once again
1	then , tomorrow at first light , we will decide whether we sail home or hold out here
1	still the achaeans never would have yielded before the prince 's charge if paris the lord of lovely fair-haired helen had not put a stop to machaon 's gallant fighting , striking the healer squarely with an arrow triple-flanged that gouged his right shoulder
1	but zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied , god of the earthquake , well you know my plans , the strategy in my mind , and why i call you here
1	the rest repair the thwarts , replace the charred beams with new ship timbers , refit the oars and cables ; no large troop , but their spirits burn for war
1	taking his stand , right in the milling troops , the herald called out in a high , firm voice , son of atreus !
1	they light the lamps , hung from the coffered ceilings sheathed in gilt , and blazing torches burn the night away
1	noble oeneus hosted your brave bellerophon once , he held him there in his halls , twenty whole days , and they gave each other handsome gifts of friendship
1	that was his cry as hector put fresh fighting spirit in each man
1	my son , he says , so pressed by the fate of troy— cassandra alone made such a prophecy to me
1	but there on the god-built heights stood aged priam
1	all of them struggle there to defend their walls , some with javelins , some with rocks or flinging blazing torches , nocking arrows to bowstrings
1	again a stranger bride , a marriage with a stranger once again
1	and now glaucus son of hippolochus and tydeus ' son diomedes met in the no man 's land between both armies : burning for battle , closing , squaring off and the lord of the war cry diomedes opened up , who are you , my fine friend ?
1	hera queen of the gods , daughter of giant cronus launched the work , harnessed the golden-bridled team while athena , child of zeus whose shield is thunder , letting fall her supple robe at the father 's threshold — rich brocade , stitched with her own hands ' labor — donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning , buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war
1	odysseus left them dead and skewered hippasus ' son , one charops the blood brother of wealthy socus but socus moved in quick as a god to shield his kin , standing up to his enemy , crying out , odysseus — wild for fame , glutton for cunning , glutton for war , today you can triumph over the two sons of hippasus , killing such good men and stripping off their gear — or beaten down by my spear you will breathe your last !
1	what ’ s worse , as the young virgin lavinia lit the altar with pure torches , flanking her father , look—what horror ! —her flowing hair caught fire , her lovely regalia crackled in the flames , her regal tresses blazed , her crown blazing , studded with flashing jewels—the next moment the girl was engulfed in a smoky yellow glare , strewing the god of fire ’ s power through the house
1	the carthaginians calm their fiery temper and queen dido , above all , takes to heart a spirit of peace and warm good will to meet the men of troy
1	but now acestes rebukes entellus sharply , sitting side by side on a grassy rise of ground : entellus , once our bravest hero , where ’ s it gone ?
1	magus begged no more as aeneas lashed back : all those bars of silver and gold you brag of , save them for your sons !
1	father anchises , barely pausing , gives the man his hand and the friendly gesture lifts the stranger ’ s spirits
1	swinging their prows around to face the sea , they moor the fleet with the anchors ’ biting grip and the curved sterns edge the bay
1	there sleep came to a halt — before the eyes of the father could detect him — and climbed up softly into a towering pine tree
1	today an illustrious son is born to rule the argives
1	ah but then , when the happy spring brought time for payment round , that outrageous man laomedon robbed us blind
1	now listen to what i ’ m mulling over , what new plan is shaping in my mind
1	you have forgotten me , my friend
1	and time and again the tyrians burst into applause and the trojans took their lead
1	but tlepolemus ' shaft had struck sarpedon too , the honed tip of the weapon hitting his left thigh , ferocious , razoring into flesh and scraping bone but his father beat off death a little longer
1	true , but the life that 's left me will be long , the stroke of death will not come on me quickly
1	both men armed at opposite sides of the forces , into the ring they strode and met , burning for battle , glances menacing , wild excitement seizing all their comrades
1	why , i just left beroë now , sick and bitter to be the only one deprived of our lavish rites , denied her part in the honors paid anchises
1	the law forbids me to carry living bodies across in my stygian boat
1	but that is not my way
1	but iasus became a captain of athens ' troops , sphelus ' son he was called and bucolus ' grandson
1	and round his back diomedes slung the hide of a big tawny lion , swinging down to his heels , he grasped a spear and the fighter strode away and roused those men to leave their beds and march
1	what terror has driven one or the other side to rush to arms and rouse their enemies ’ swords ?
1	with that , over my broad shoulders and round my neck i spread a tawny lion ’ s skin for a cloak , and bowing down , i lift my burden up
1	so he roused the fury in battling ajax ' heart and down the front he stalked with the red-haired king
1	he harangued the immortals hanging on his words : hear me , all you gods and all goddesses too , as i proclaim what the heart inside me urges
1	they were struck with awe as father anchises paused , then carried on : look there , marcellus marching toward us , decked in splendid plunder he tore from a chief he killed , victorious , towering over all
1	the dirge rises up
1	now , long ablaze as he was to fight the trojans , triple the fury seized him — claw-mad as a lion some shepherd tending woolly flocks in the field has just grazed , a lion leaping into the fold , but he has not killed him , only spurred his strength and helpless to beat him off the man scurries for shelter , leaving his flocks panicked , lost as the ramping beast mauls them thick-and-fast , piling corpse on corpse and in one furious bound clears the fenced yard — so raging diomedes mauled the trojans
1	as a huge oak goes down at a stroke from father zeus , ripped up by the roots and a grim reek of sulphur bursts forth from the trunk and a passerby too close , looking on , loses courage — the bolt of mighty zeus is hell on earth — so in a flash , for all his fighting power , hector plunged in the dust , his spear dropped from his fist , shield and helmet crushing in on him , bronze gear clashing round him
1	but there was a man among the troops , one dolon , a son of the sacred trojan herald eumedes
1	but glaucus , hippolochus ' son and lord of lycia 's forces now , scowled at hector , lashing out at him : hector — our prince of beauty , in battle all a sham !
1	so veteran troops kept swarming round that corpse , never pausing — nor did mighty zeus for a moment turn his shining eyes from the clash of battle
1	with boundless timber piled on all sides of the place , down they sat , waiting , massed
1	the sibyl , seeing the serpents writhe around his neck , tossed him a sop , slumbrous with honey and drugged seed , and he , frothing with hunger , three jaws spread wide , snapped it up where the sibyl tossed it—gone
1	why does your son attack me , whip my waters more than all the others ?
1	o father zeus — draw our armies clear of the cloud , give us a bright sky , give us back our sight !
1	this the italians watch , enthralled as the birds all scream and swerving round in flight—a marvel , look—they overshadow the sky with wings , and forming a dense cloudbank , force their enemy high up through the air until , beaten down by their strikes and his victim ’ s weight , his talons dropped the kill in the river ’ s run and into the clouds the eagle winged away
1	when arcadia 's champion ereuthalion strode forth , a man like a god for power , his shoulders decked with king areithous ' armor , massive areithous
1	not so loud the breakers bellowing out against the shore , driven in from open sea by the north wind 's brutal blast , not so loud the roar of fire whipped to a crackling blaze rampaging into a mountain gorge , raging up through timber , not so loud the gale that howls in the leafy crowns of oaks when it hits its pitch of fury tearing branches down — nothing so loud as cries of trojans , cries of achaeans , terrible war cries , armies storming against each other
1	they say you are a son of aphrodite , zeus 's daughter , but achilles sprang from a lesser goddess ' loins — aphrodite 's a child of zeus , thetis comes from the old man of the sea
1	around him trusted comrades swung to the work , preparing breakfast , steadying in their midst a large fleecy sheep just slaughtered in the shelter
1	come , up with you now , climb aboard my chariot !
1	his looks , his words , they pierce her heart and cling— no peace , no rest for her body , love will give her none
1	they can not hold their line , not if the ropes of death are knotted round their necks !
1	but since the gods ordained it all , these desperate years , i wish i had been the wife of a better man , someone alive to outrage , the withering scorn of men
1	you must give way
1	and the sort you use is just the sort you will hear
1	hector bore his round shield in the forefront , blazing out like the dog star through the clouds , all withering fire , then plunging back in the cloud-rack massed and dark — so hector ranged on , now flaring along the front , now shouting his orders back toward the rear , all of him armed in bronze aflash like lightning flung by father zeus with his battle-shield of thunder
1	he was like the man to the life , every feature , the same tall build and the fine eyes and voice and the very robes that used to clothe his body
1	bearing down beneath the rush of the west wind and miles away he sees it building black as pitch , blacker , whipping the whitecaps , full hurricane fury — the herdsman shudders to see it , drives his flocks to a cave — so dense the battalions grouped behind the two aeantes , packed , massed with hardy fighters dear to the gods , battalions black and bristling shields and spears , fighters sweeping into the breaking storm of war
1	antilochus came in last and carried off his prize with a broad smile and a joke to warm his comrades : i will tell you something you have always known , my friends — down to this very day the gods prefer old-timers
1	what other warmth , what comfort 's left for me , once you have met your doom ?
1	but they still kept swarming round and round the corpse like flies in a sheepfold buzzing over the brimming pails in the first spring days when the buckets flood with milk
1	you know how the furies always stand by older brothers
1	patroclus — wherever he saw the biggest masses dashing before him , there he steered , plowing ahead with savage cries and fighters tumbled out of their chariots headfirst , crushed under their axles , war-cars crashing over , yes , but straight across the trench went his own careering team at a superhuman bound
1	whatever can be done
1	and there in the heart of battle mars rampages on , cast in iron , with grim furies plunging down the sky and strife in triumph rushing in with her slashed robes and bellona cracking her bloody lash in hot pursuit
1	or in my immortal rage i may just toss you over , hate you as i adore you now — with a vengeance
1	can such rage inflame the immortals ’ hearts ?
1	shaped like the runner acamas , prince of thrace , ares challenged the sons of priam with a vengeance : you royal sons of priam , monarch dear to the gods , how long will you let achaeans massacre your army ?
1	back it rears , flailing the air with flying hoofs and throwing its rider , pitching headlong down in a tangled mass , it ’ s shoulder-joint torn out , it crushes mezentius ’ body to the ground
1	but achaea 's warlords clustered round achilles , begging him to eat
1	bursting in rage against the gods , she bore a sister for coeus and enceladus : rumor , quicksilver afoot and swift on the wing , a monster , horrific , huge and under every feather on her body—what a marvel— an eye that never sleeps and as many tongues as eyes and as many raucous mouths and ears pricked up for news
1	the men who trooped with hector and prince polydamas — they were the greatest force , the best and bravest , grim set above all the rest to breach the wall and go for the beaked ships and fight it out
1	but now , look , he 's leading the trojan rampage , his pledges thrown to the winds !
1	and the steady , long-enduring odysseus replied , great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , that man has no intention of quenching his rage
1	but hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer , suddenly bursting out , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
1	turnus adds to their anguish , quietly moving toward the altar , eyes downcast , to pray
1	nestor grasped the glistening reins in both fists , lashed the team and they charged straight at hector charging straight at them as tydides hurled a spear and missed his man but he picked the driver off , eniopeus son of proud thebaeus gripping the reins — he slashed him beside the nipple , stabbed his chest and off the car he pitched , his horses balking , rearing
1	they escorted him home to troy — saved , past all their hopes — while far across the field the achaean men-at-arms escorted ajax , thrilled with victory , back to agamemnon
1	and now hector would have hauled the body away and won undying glory
1	let him get past us first , into the clear a bit , then rush him and overtake him double-quick !
1	but have no fear of death , no dread in your heart , such a powerful escort will conduct you — the giant-killer hermes will guide you all the way to achilles ' presence
1	seven citadels i will give him , filled with people , cardamyle , enope , and the grassy slopes of hire , pherae the sacrosanct , anthea deep in meadows , rolling aepea and pedasus green with vineyards
1	i erected the rampart round the trojans ' city , a massive ashlar wall to make the place impregnable
1	then over his shoulder paris slung his sword , the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt , and then the shield-strap and his sturdy , massive shield and over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror , and last he grasped a spear that matched his grip
1	or under my own roof i may not spare your life , old man — suppliant that you are — may break the laws of zeus !
1	his life is doomed by the fates but now he tests his luck for the quickest way in
1	then , terrified by her fate , tragic dido prays for death , sickened to see the vaulting sky above her
1	you should have called me on to the same fate
1	wild as a boulder plowing headlong down from a summit , torn out by the tempests—whether the stormwinds washed it free or the creeping years stole under it , worked it loose , down the cliff it crashes , ruthless crag of rock bounding over the ground with enormous impact , churning up in its onrush woods and herds and men
1	no joy had he known from her for all his gifts , the full hundred oxen he gave her on the spot then promised a thousand head of goats and sheep from the boundless herds he would rounded up himself
1	but both fighters will share this armor , bear it off , and we will give them a victor 's banquet in our tents
1	her eyes lowered , dido replies with a few choice words of welcome : cast fear to the winds , trojans , free your minds
1	but they pick by lot the best , most able-bodied men and stealthily lock them into the horse ’ s dark flanks till the vast hold of the monster ’ s womb is packed with soldiers bristling weapons
1	and over across from him patroclus slept with the sashed and lovely iphis by his side , whom prince achilles gave him the day he took the heights of scyros , enyeus ' rocky stronghold
1	the famous name of the queen holds out its shield , and the hero wins support for his many feats , his trophies won in war
1	hector leapt to ground from his chariot fully armed and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face : but against their mass the argives closed ranks , the fighting about to break , the troops squaring off and atrides , tense to outfight them all , charged first
1	hold back no more
1	both champions , belted tight , stepped into the ring , squared off at each other and let loose , trading jabs with their clenched fists then slugged it out — flurries of jolting punches , terrific grinding of jaws , sweat rivering , bodies glistening — suddenly euryalus glanced for an opening , dropped his guard and epeus hurled his smashing roundhouse hook to the head — a knockout blow !
1	for i must go home to see my people first , to visit my own dear wife and my baby son
1	under his ear great ajax stabbed with a heavy lance , wrenched the weapon out and down he went like a tall ash on a landmark mountain ridge that glistens far and wide — chopped down by an ax , its leaves running with sap , strewn across the earth
1	once they reached athena 's shrine on the city crest the beauty theano opened the doors to let them in , cisseus ' daughter , the horseman antenor 's wife and athena 's priestess chosen by the trojans
1	but pallas forbids them to cut short the rites , and fearless , seizes a spear and runs to confront the new arrivals by himself
1	he who gave that prize has snatched it back again — what outrage !
1	now with the gifts presented , all were moving off , proud of their prizes , scarlet ribbons binding their brows when here comes sergestus , bringing in his ship
1	but then the gods of heaven brought this agony on you — ceaseless battles round your walls , your armies slaughtered
1	we follow you , blessed god , whoever you are— glad at heart we obey your commands once more
1	but look , who is that over there , crowned with an olive wreath and bearing sacred emblems ?
1	he 's wounded me off guard and now he triumphs — he boasts i wo not look long on the light of day
1	no less in another zone the grieving latins raise up countless pyres too
1	now amid the din , as the fiery controversy flared , look , to top it off , the grim-set envoys enter , bearing the news from diomedes ’ noble city : nothing has been won , for all our attempts
1	turning your back in battle like some coward !
1	take my advice and wipe it from your mind , good as your message is — you are in my hands now
1	when he caught some common soldier shouting out , he would beat him with the scepter , dress him down : you fool — sit still !
1	now squad on squad , gate to gate they fought — but how can i tell it all , sing it all like a god ?
1	many the sons i had whom the swift runner achilles caught and shipped on the barren salt sea as slaves to samos , to imbros , to lemnos shrouded deep in mist !
1	so aeneas pleaded , his face streaming tears
1	never refuse to bow to my commands
1	and he rose up tall and challenged all the achaeans : now two come forward — fight to win this prize !
1	if losers win such prizes , nisus erupted now , and the ones who trip , such pity—what gift will you give to nisus worth his salt ?
1	but zeus would not fulfill their prayers , not yet
1	on with the fighting , quickly !
1	but even so , my sister , carry out for me one great favor in my pain
1	her quiver is gold , her hair drawn up in a golden torque and a golden buckle clasps her purple robe in folds
1	and i had given my own life , and the long last march brought me , not pallas , home !
1	but the gods wo not give us all their gifts at once
1	we will deal with all this later , in due time
1	so the cephallenians held their ground there , poised
1	and let him give you his own fine armor to wear in war so the trojans might take you for him , patroclus , yes , hold off from attack , and achaea 's fighting sons get second wind , exhausted as they are
1	there were fifty fast black ships that bore his troops when achilles dear to zeus sailed east for troy
1	who ’ ll take word to aeneas ?
1	yes , but all night long the master strategist zeus plotted fresh disaster for both opposing armies — his thunder striking terror — and blanching panic swept across the ranks
1	what do we need with wrangling , hurling insults ?
1	achates , following orders , hurries toward the ships
1	so he left his feet and down he went — out cold — but big-hearted epeus hoisted him in his arms and stood him upright
1	he had barely touched the prow when juno bursts the cables , rips the ship from her moorings , blows her out to sea on the tide ebbing fast
1	the old horseman peleus had me escort you , that day he sent you out of phthia to agamemnon , a youngster still untrained for the great leveler , war , still green at debate where men can make their mark
1	not even achilles who smashes whole battalions — he would never yield to him in a stand-up fight though in downfield racing none can touch the man
1	and diomedes lord of the war cry prayed aloud , hear me , daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder , tireless one , athena !
1	they were afraid , they held the king in awe and stood there , silent
1	as the fighter tore it out the blood came gushing forth and his heart sank
1	i love her like no one else !
1	drop those bloody spoils !
1	come , let the heralds cry out to all contingents , full battle-armor , muster the men along the ships
1	and now the exultant argives seized the chance to drag patroclus ' body quickly out of range and laid him on a litter
1	the fiery sun had climbed to mid-career when , off in the distance , they catch sight of walls , a citadel , scattered roofs of houses : all that now the imperial power of rome has lifted to the skies , but then what evander held , his humble kingdom
1	the fighter had no idea at all that famous gifts of the gods do not break lightly , ca not be crushed when a mortal hand assails them
1	but hector saw them and called at once to aeneas posted close beside him , aeneas , counselor of the trojans armed in bronze , i can see the great runner achilles ' team — look there — heading into the fight but reined by feeble drivers
1	one of us would have lived , the one whom mars— or his own right arm—had granted life
1	misenus , aeolus ’ son , a herald unsurpassed at rallying troops with his trumpet ’ s cry , igniting the god of war with its shrill blare
1	an ingot big enough to keep the winner in iron for five wheeling years
1	child of zeus whose battle-shield is thunder , tireless one , athena — what , is this the way ?
1	he shouts in hot pursuit , flashing his naked sword , blind to the winds that scatter all his triumph
1	so , my arrow failed to bring you down , my tearing shot ?
1	just as the two men closed , heading into each other , atrides missed — his spearshaft hooking off to the side — pisander stabbed his shield but the bronze could not bore through — the huge hide blocked it , the shaft snapped at the socket
1	wherever the richest land of green calydon lay , there they urged him to choose a grand estate , full fifty acres , half of it turned to vineyards , half to open plowland , and carve it from the plain
1	never would he repay his loving parents now for the gift of rearing — his life cut short so soon , brought down by the spear of lionhearted ajax
1	he knew them both , he would seen them once by the ships when the swift achilles dragged them in from ida
1	why so hard to starboard ?
1	the olympian lord of lightning — what if he would like to blast us from our seats ?
1	turnus amidst them , proud in his chariot , puffed up with his new success , spurring the war-lust on !
1	but men who held the center suffered agonies , thanks to the haze and carnage — ruthless bronze hacking their lines to pieces , there where the bravest fought
1	he lays unlucky acron low , his heels pounding the dark earth as he gasps his life away and dyes the weapon splintered off in his body blood-red
1	their proud discipline gripped them , terror too — they rallied each other , nonstop , war cries rising
1	what can nisus do ?
1	night , drawn by the hours , approaches mid-career when palinurus , on the alert , leaps up from bed to test the winds , his ears keen for the first stir , scanning the constellations wheeling down the quiet sky , arcturus , the rainy hyades and the great and little bears , his eyes roving to find orion geared in gold
1	i heard her voice with my own ears , i looked straight at the goddess , face-to-face
1	whatever verses the seer writes down on leaves she puts in order , sealed in her cave , left behind
1	hera 's urgings , i trust , have made you suffer this
1	phrygian blood will corrupt our own , and i , i ’ m driven from the doors !
1	deiphobus ' mind was torn — should he pull back and call a friend to his side , some hardy trojan , or take the argive on alone ?
1	life or death — now prove yourself a spearman , a daring man of war !
1	not aeneas alone but flanked by antenor 's two sons , acamas and archelochus , trained for every foray
1	he 's stripped , naked — hector with that flashing helmet , hector has your arms !
1	but still the breakneck trojans , up in arms as they were , killed off none of the argives with their spears — instead they began to drag away patroclus ' corpse
1	like flocks of sheep in a wealthy rancher 's steadings , thousands crowding to have their white milk drained , bleating nonstop when they hear their crying lambs — so the shouts rose up from the long trojan lines and not one cry , no common voice to bind them all together , their tongues mixed and clashed , their men hailed from so many far-flung countries
1	and the cretan captains form a ring around him
1	would to god my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw — such agonies you have caused me !
1	so then , when those terrible , monstrous omens burst in on the victims we were offering to the gods , calchas swiftly revealed the will of zeus : 'why struck dumb now , my long-haired achaeans ?
1	atrides went on the run and reached him , shouting , ajax !
1	the trojan crews had laughed when he took the plunge , then when he floundered round and now they laugh as he retches spews of brine from his heaving chest
1	his heart was racing — what could he do to help him ?
1	my hopes are rising now — i pray to zeus and the great array of deathless gods that we will whip the achaeans howling out of troy and drive them off to death , those dogs of war the deadly fates drove here in their black ships !
1	and jove almighty , and you , his queen , saturnia— goddess , be kinder now , i pray you , now at last !
1	take a message home to evander , tell him this : the pallas i send him back will serve him right !
1	for company , two watchdogs go loping on before him over the high doorsill , friends to their master ’ s steps
1	the rest of his flesh seemed all encased in armor , burnished , brazen — achilles ' armor that hector stripped from strong patroclus when he killed him — true , but one spot lay exposed , where collarbones lift the neckbone off the shoulders , the open throat , where the end of life comes quickest — there as hector charged in fury brilliant achilles drove his spear and the point went stabbing clean through the tender neck but the heavy bronze weapon failed to slash the windpipe — hector could still gasp out some words , some last reply
1	and coming to meet them , marching from the camp , the great founder , aeneas , source of the roman race , with his blazoned starry shield and armor made in heaven
1	first he cracks its neck , clamped in his huge jaws , mauling the kill then down in gulps he bolts it , blood and guts , and around him dogs and shepherds raise a fierce din but they keep their distance , lacking nerve to go in and take the lion on — the fear that grips their spirit makes them blanch
1	and then , if a man reveres these daughters of zeus as they draw near him , they will help him greatly and listen to his appeals
1	but if you are serious , speaking from the heart , the gods themselves have blotted out your senses
1	or would you rather settle here in my realm on equal terms with me ?
1	whom do we follow ?
1	what insanity ’ s this that shifts my fixed resolve ?
1	the heart in his rugged chest was pounding , torn
1	sing them yourself , i beg you !
1	but if you hang back from the grueling battle now , your day has dawned to be crushed by trojans
1	neither idomeneus nor agamemnon dared stand his ground , nor did the great and little ajax , old campaigners , nestor alone held out , the noble horseman , achaea 's watch and ward , but not of his own will
1	no achaean in sight will knock me out and take her — i am the greatest !
1	euneus son of jason gave it to prince patroclus , the ransom paid to release lycaon , priam 's son
1	he had just grasped the corpse when shining hector smashed his head with a rock and his whole skull split in his massive helmet — down he slammed on sarpedon 's body , facefirst and courage-shattering death engulfed his corpse
1	one you killed in the ranks of frontline fighters , noble polydorus , ran him down with your lance and a gruesome death awaits me here and now — no hope of escape for me , from your clutches , not when destiny drives me up against you
1	now this approach , now that , exploring the circuit round from every side , he shakes his fatal spear in his ruthless fist
1	so , father , at least fulfill this prayer for me : let the men escape with their lives if nothing else — do not let these trojans mow us down in droves !
1	aeneas springs to the entryway and rinsing his limbs with fresh pure water , there at the threshold , just before them , stakes the golden bough
1	but i , i wo not stop killing these overweening trojans , not till i have packed them in their walls and tested hector , strength against strength — he kills me or i kill him !
1	standing by me always , in every combat mission — no maneuver of mine slips by you — now , again , give me your best support , athena , comrade !
1	the lord of men agamemnon reassured him : nestor , son of neleus , glory of achaea , do not you recognize agamemnon ?
1	the comrades , too , bring on what gifts they can , their spirits high , loading the altars , killing steers , while others , setting the bronze cauldrons out in order , stretch along the grass , holding spits over embers , broiling cuts of meat
1	what plans are they mapping , what maneuvers next ?
1	are you still married to pyrrhus ?
1	like him to the life , the deadly archer taunted , hector , what achaean will ever fear you now ?
1	but at long last menelaus leapt up and spoke , lashing out at them , groaning , heartsick : oh no — your threats , your bluster — women , not men of achaea !
1	they need not fear our stealing up on them in the dark like skulking cowards to rob them of their palladium , butcher their sentries posted on the heights
1	a nightmare — i fear it , with all my heart — i fear the gods will carry out his threats and then it will be our fate to die in troy , far from the stallion-land of argos
1	but dauntless turnus never loses faith in his daring , he flares up more at his men , inflaming their spirits more : all these omens threaten the trojans !
1	king osinius sailed her here , straight from the shores of clusium
1	from that point on i plan my tactics , give commands to grant the argives breathing room in battle
1	abandon the gods ' high road and be a mortal !
1	i have covered him over , sent him into a deep , soothing sleep as soon as hera seduced great zeus to lose himself in love
1	i thought he was at my side , the hero deiphobus — he 's safe inside the walls , athena 's tricked me blind
1	and yours too , menelaus — look at this cloud of war that blots out all the field , this hector , this headlong death that stares us in the face !
1	he bore evander ’ s arms in arcadia once , but the omens were less bright when he marched out with pallas , beloved foster-son
1	charioteers swung chariots round , thrust the powerful fist of fury straight ahead and murderous ares keen to help the trojans shrouded the carnage over in dense dark night — lunging at all points , carrying out the commands of phoebus apollo , lord of the golden sword , who ordered ares to whip the trojans ' war-lust once he spotted athena veering off the lines , great pallas who would rushed to back the argives
1	surely no achaean will curse me , seeing me now , giving ground to hector
1	best to yield to night
1	they heaped a single great barrow over the corpse-fire , one great communal grave stretched out across the plain and fronting it threw up looming ramparts quickly , a landward wall for ships and troops themselves , and amidst the wall built gateways fitted strong to open a clear path for driving chariots through
1	now at the same moment jove , the king of mighty olympus , turns to juno , gazing down on the war from her golden cloud , and says : where will it end , my queen ?
1	achilles threatens , tomorrow at first light , to haul his well-benched warships out to sea
1	our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of argos , the land of achaea where the women are a wonder
1	there your house , the line of aeneas , will rule all parts of the world— your sons ’ sons and all their descendants down the years
1	with that he loosed a shrill cry to his trojans , trojans !
1	but if he 's the man i think he is , tydeus ' gallant son , he rages so with a god beside him — not alone , no — a god with his shoulders shrouded round in cloud who deflects my shaft to a less mortal spot
1	and hera the queen , her dark eyes wide , exclaimed , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
1	heroic sarpedon — his loyal comrades bore him out of the fighting quickly , weighed down by the heavy spearshaft dragging on
1	how furious father was with me , over his mistress with her dark , glistening hair
1	enemy weapons beating against him , worse , he dreaded the trojans too , swarming round him , a tough ring of them , brave and bristling spears , massing , rearing over their comrade 's body now and rugged , strong and proud as the great ajax was , they shoved him back — he gave ground , staggering , reeling
1	that much room for indulgence i will give you
1	the battalions gathered quickly
1	then he would yoke his racing team to the chariot-harness , lash the corpse of hector behind the car for dragging and haul him three times round the dead patroclus ' tomb , and then he would rest again in his tents and leave the body sprawled facedown in the dust
1	by your own brave work exalt our trojan greatness to the skies
1	the armies grouping now — as seasoned goatherds split their wide-ranging flocks into packs with ease when herds have mixed together down the pasture : so the captains formed their tight platoons , detaching right and left , moving up for action — and there in the midst strode powerful agamemnon , eyes and head like zeus who loves the lightning , great in the girth like ares , god of battles , broad through the chest like sea lord poseidon
1	next , from the marsian stock a priest came marching in , his helmet crowned with a leafy olive spray : sent by king archippus , umbro , no man braver , an old hand , with his touch and spells , at shedding sleep on the vipers ’ spawn and lake-snakes hissing death , at soothing their anger , healing bites with his magic arts
1	and now , as soon as the two drove past the great tomb of ilus they drew rein at the ford to water mules and team
1	they still camped on the slopes of ida wet with springs
1	we lived in our halls together , prized the man as we prize our beloved parents — hector 's killed him !
1	first he leaves astern sergestus struggling still at his beetling rock , splashing in shallows , crying for help—no use— as he studies how to race with shattered oars
1	he is no poor man who owns what they have won , not strapped for goods with all that lovely gold — what trophies those high-strung horses carried off for me !
1	the brisk commands he issued pleased them all
1	all the while neptune sensed the furor above him , the roaring seas first and the storm breaking next—his standing waters boiling up from the sea-bed , churning back
1	but now it 's for you to dodge my brazen spear — i wish you would bury it in your body to the hilt
1	the vast plains of the sea are yours to plow until you reach hesperian land , where lydian tiber flows with its smooth march through rich and loamy fields , a land of hardy people
1	and amata mid them all , shaking a flaming brand of pine , breaks into a marriage hymn for turnus and her daughter— rolling her bloodshot eyes she suddenly bursts out , wildly : mothers of latium , listen , wherever you are , if any love for unlucky amata still stirs your hearts , your loyal hearts—if any care for a mother ’ s rights still cuts you to the quick , loose your headbands , seize on the orgies with me !
1	he adds horses too , pilots to guide our way , fills out our crews , rearms our fighting comrades
1	mnestheus commands the dragon swift with her eager crew , mnestheus soon of italy , soon from him the memmian clan would take its name
1	he will leave those men in a flash , achaeans , trojans , overweening trojans , and back great zeus will come to batter us on olympus , seize one after another — gods guilty and innocent routed all together
1	unknowing let him stay there !
1	and there in the midst achilles stood like the god of war , urging his charioteers and fighters bracing shields
1	so he wept and prayed and his noble mother heard him , seated near her father , the old man of the sea in the salt green depths
1	the lord of men agamemnon shuddered , frightened to see the dark blood gushing from the wound
1	her eyes afire the goddess pallas did not resist a moment
1	challenge away , i beg you
1	as when some lion overpowers a tireless wild boar up on a mountain summit , battling in all their fury over a little spring of water , both beasts craving to slake their thirst , but the lion beats him down with sheer brute force as the boar fights for breath — so now with a close thrust hector the son of priam tore the life from the fighting son of menoetius , from patroclus who had killed so many men in war , and gloried over him , wild winging words : patroclus — surely you must have thought you would storm my city down , you would wrest from the wives of troy their day of freedom , drag them off in ships to your own dear fatherland — you fool !
1	he shook his head and addressed his own deep heart : poor creatures , why did we give you to king peleus , a mortal doomed to death
1	here is the ancient line of teucer , noblest stock of all , those great-hearted heroic sons born in better years , ilus , and assaracus , and dardanus , founder of troy
1	here , under steep roofs in the dark night , turnus , dead to the world , lay fast asleep
1	once the huntsmen have reached the trackless lairs aloft in the foothills , suddenly , look , some wild goats flushed from a ridge come scampering down the slopes and lower down a herd of stags goes bounding across the open country , ranks massed in a cloud of dust , fleeing the high ground
1	all you argives flying home to your fatherland , tumbling into your oar-swept ships ?
1	greater than any man on earth , greater in outrage too — for the gods themselves are always at your side !
1	at the fever ’ s first attack with its clammy poison still stealing over the queen , trickling through her wits and twining her bones with fire— before her mind was seized by the flames within her spirit she could still speak softly , a mother ’ s tender way , sobbing over her daughter ’ s marriage to a phrygian : so , lavinia goes in wedlock to these trojans—exiles ?
1	and with that command zeus roused incessant battle
1	but odysseus fine at tactics answered firmly , not so quickly , brave as you are , godlike achilles
1	whoever brought this war on both our countries , let him rot and sink to the house of death — but let our pacts of friendship all hold fast !
1	wait , would you like to see the tarquin kings , the overweening spirit of brutus the avenger , the fasces he reclaims ?
1	so now not a single trojan fighter had the spine to go and face atrides tensing in all his strength
1	inspired by the signs and their own raw power all pitched in to smash the achaeans ' massive wall
1	only estrange yourself from me a little more — and all the worse for you
1	if you ever stood by father with all your love amidst the blaze of battle , stand by me — do me a favor now , athena
1	a single pine beam held the gates , and it took three men to ram it home , three to shoot the immense bolt back and spread the doors — three average men
1	the grisly swamp and its loveless , lethal waters bind them fast , styx with its nine huge coils holds them captive
1	how can he save his young friend— what force , weapons , what bold stroke ?
1	and here are men to confirm it , fellow envoys
1	never a fear of me — far from the fighting as i was — you fool !
1	primordial earth and juno , queen of marriage , give the signal and lightning torches flare and the high sky bears witness to the wedding , nymphs on the mountaintops wail out the wedding hymn
1	pounding it in his palms , he crushed a bitter root and covered over the gash to kill his comrade 's pain , a cure that fought off every kind of pain
1	one favor now , i pray you
1	with that he clasped the old king by the wrist , by the right hand , to free his heart from fear
1	i rate that man the luckiest one among us , first in the work of war , first in strength of heart , who spurning the sight of our surrender , falls , dying , and bites the dust for one last time
1	he asked automedon , ready aide , to bring the breastplate from his tents
1	go , range the ranks of achaeans armed in bronze
1	that 's the pain that wounds me , suffering such humiliation
1	but hector cut down schedius now , perimedes ' son , a phocian chieftain — and ajax killed laodamas , captain of infantry , antenor 's splendid son — and polydamas killed cyllenian otus outright , meges ' friend , one of the proud epeans ' leaders
1	comrades below , posted in close-packed ranks , block the entries , swordpoints drawn and poised
1	awesome and quick to anger , the man who sent me here to find out who 's been wounded , the one you have just brought in
1	what ’ s held you back so long ?
1	shrill shouts hitting the heavens , fighters racing for home , knocking the blocks out underneath the hulls
1	no hunter could spot a trace that led toward that cave
1	and nestor the noble driver answered warmly , right you are , my friend , straight to the point
1	you , the noble son of a proud maeonian house , where the farmhands work the loamy soil and pactolus floods the fields with gold
1	hera might catch us here
1	the harbor curves like a bow , bent by eastern combers , rocky breakwaters foam with the salt surf spray , the haven ’ s just behind them
1	yet they can ’ t hold out
1	look what heavy casualties you have suffered just for me , my violent quarrel , and paris who brought it on you all
1	he knew her at once—his mother— and called after her now as she sped away : why , you too , cruel as the rest ?
1	either my right arm will send that dardan down to hell , that rank deserter of asia—my armies can sit back and watch , and turnus ’ sword alone will rebut the charge of cowardice trained against them all
1	at last she assails aeneas , before he ’ s said a word : so , you traitor , you really believed you ’ d keep this a secret , this great outrage ?
1	stop concocting this panic for me , please
1	as crosswinds chop the sea where the fish swarm , the north wind and the west wind blasting out of thrace in sudden , lightning attack , wave on blacker wave , cresting , heaving a tangled mass of seaweed out along the surf — so the achaeans ' hearts were torn inside their chests
1	seek a city for them , once you have roved the seas , erect great walls at last to house the gods of troy !
1	then i will build you a solid marble temple , apollo and diana , establish hallowed days , apollo , in your name
1	gaining that landfall , making port , what do we see but sleek lusty herds of cattle grazing the plains , flocks of goats unguarded , cropping grassland ?
1	but meges did hit croesmus , stabbed him square in the chest with a thrusting-lance and down he crashed — with meges tearing the armor off his back as the trojan dolops lunged at him
1	they all stood silent , trading startled glances fixed on each other , hushed
1	book fifteen : the achaean armies at bay
1	down from ida 's peaks he swooped like a hawk , the killer of doves , the fastest thing on wings
1	just in range are the snow-white canvas tents of rhesus— he knows them at once , and sobs—rhesus ’ men betrayed in their first slumber , droves of them slaughtered by diomedes splattered with their blood , lashing back to the greek camp their high-strung teams before they could ever savor the grass of troy or drink at xanthus ’ banks
1	how doomed you are , look — far from your loved ones and native land — to glut with your shining fat the wild dogs of battle here in troy
1	their mourning was over now as jove from high heaven , gazing down on the sea , the whitecaps winged with sails , the lands outspread , the coasts , the nations of the earth , paused at the zenith of the sky and set his sights on libya , that proud kingdom
1	then onto the flaming chariot pallas set her feet and seized her spear — weighted , heavy , the massive shaft she wields to break the battle lines of heroes the mighty father 's daughter storms against
1	then father almighty , enraged that any mortal rise from the shades below , return to the light of life , jove with his lightning bolt struck down apollo ’ s son who honed such healing skills , down to the styx ’ s flood
1	trust me — we will face disaster
1	i come from the axius ' broad currents — axius floods the land with the clearest stream on earth and axius fathered the famous spearman pelegon
1	for there is a man i will enrage — i see it now — a powerful man who lords it over all the argives , one the achaeans must obey
1	and with that threat the god of the sea-blue mane led the way to the fortress raised for godlike heracles : earth piled on both sides , a high imposing breastwork men of troy and pallas athena flung up for the man where he could race and escape that sea monster whenever it charged him hard from shore to plain
1	now the achaeans milled among the ship ways , shielded round by the looming superstructures , stern on stern drawn up on the first line inland
1	look — our finest champions laid up in the ships , all hit by arrows or run through by spears
1	her retinue fawning round her , phrygian ladies , slaves ?
1	save us from this ruthless day !
1	why do you battle so ?
1	so they clash , the trojan armies , armies of latins , foot dug in against foot , man packed against man
1	hypanis , dymas die as well , run through by their own men— and you , panthus , not all your piety , all the sacred bands you wore as apollo ’ s priest could save you as you fell
1	if only you would all been killed at the fast ships instead of my dear hector
1	so drive them yourself , your chariot and your team and let him charge — i will take him on with a sharp spear
1	his helmet flashed as hector nodded : yes , ajax , since god has given you power , build and sense and you are the strongest spearman of achaea , let us break off this dueling to the death , at least for today
1	you , dear earth , hold fast to that spear !
1	and while they prayed to the daughter of mighty zeus hector approached the halls of paris , sumptuous halls he built himself with the finest masons of the day , master builders famed in the fertile land of troy
1	and flanking them meriones came in haste with nestor 's handsome son — the kings had summoned both to share their counsel
1	so he warned as the trojans charged them , harder — and hector , lunging , leveled a pair of men who knew the joy of battle , riding a single chariot , menesthes and anchialus
1	or the two scipios , both thunderbolts of battle , libya ’ s scourge ?
1	he was overwhelmed by the latest salvos , driven back by the will of zeus and the fearless trojan spearmen hurling blows nonstop — a terrific din at his temples , his shining helmet clashing under repeated blows , relentless blows beating his forged cheek-irons
1	these are the spoils stripped from a proud king , our first fruits of battle , this is mezentius , the work of my right hand !
1	then men of phylace , pyrasus banked in flowers , demeter 's closed and holy grove and iton mother of flocks , antron along the shore and pteleos deep in meadows
1	so at their last parting the words came pouring deep from evander ’ s heart
1	do not lag behind , do not fling yourself at spoils just to haul the biggest portion back to your ship
1	in the same breath the god who shakes the mainland struck both men with his staff and filled their hearts with strength and striking force , put spring in their limbs , their feet and fighting hands
1	but the tin of the fire-new armor round his leg let loose an unearthly ring — back the spear sprang from the wondrous gear it struck , not punching through : the gift of the god hephaestus blocked its force
1	but now let us consent to the feasting that i loathe
1	i am eager to do it — whatever i can do
1	never again , i would say , will our gallant comrade risk his skin to attack the kings with insults
1	these he was just fitting , beating in the rivets
1	you are the one we would thought a worthy match for the whirling river xanthus !
1	their name till now is the name that shall endure
1	what an ominous war we wage , my countrymen !
1	euryalus seizes them , fits them onto his gallant shoulders all for nothing
1	my father 's the man who rules the hordes of myrmidons , peleus , son of aeacus , and aeacus sprang from zeus and as zeus is stronger than rivers surging out to sea , so the breed of zeus is stronger than any stream 's
1	do not tell me you rank our fathers with ourselves !
1	you , the sons of laomedon , as if to atone for the butchery of our cattle , our young bulls ?
1	the lapiths had just been rousing argives packed behind the rampart : close in a ring — defend the ships !
1	zeus who marshals the storm cloud loves you both , zeus 's daughter too with the shield of thunder
1	this is our last chance
1	like beroë now , iris mingles in among all the trojan mothers
1	and what a lovely haul , what plunder we rounded up and herded off the plain !
1	so packed around odysseus skilled and quick to maneuver swarmed the brave bulk of trojans — but still the hero kept on lunging , spearing , keeping death at bay
1	no one alive has ever escaped it , neither brave man nor coward , i tell you — it 's born with us the day that we are born
1	i had barely spoken when all at once , everything seemed to tremble , the gates of the god , apollo ’ s laurel-tree , the entire mountain around us seemed to quake , the tripod moaned , the sacred shrine swung open
1	closing , meges gave him some close attention too — the famous spearman struck behind his skull , just at the neck-cord , the razor spear slicing straight up through the jaws , cutting away the tongue — he sank in the dust , teeth clenching the cold bronze
1	our enemies swoop down on our country , full force !
1	so , couldn ’ t they die on the plains of troy ?
1	but never flinching , staunch diomedes countered , so brave with your bow and arrows — big bravado — glistening lovelocks , roving eye for girls !
1	our former champions , all laid up in the ships , all are hit by arrows or run through by spears
1	ah but tell me , hera , just what can you do about all this ?
1	king agamemnon , thrilled to watch them work , was quick to salute the chief and sing his praises : you are the one i prize , idomeneus , more than all our argive fighters fast with chariot-teams — whether in war or action of any sort or feasts where the ranking argive warlords mix their bowls with the shining wine of kings
1	that fellow who tried to fight the deathless gods
1	pay the danaans back — your arrows for my tears !
1	your trophies , nisus , now
1	leaning on this , the prince addressed his men : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies !
1	run for our lives or fling ourselves at his knees and beg for mercy !
1	and the whole assembly surged like big waves at sea , the icarian sea when east and south winds drive it on , blasting down in force from the clouds of father zeus , or when the west wind shakes the deep standing grain with hurricane gusts that flatten down the stalks — so the massed assembly of troops was shaken now
1	eurystheus , son of sthenelus , descended of perseus — so he is born of your own stock and immortal blood and it 's only right for him to rule the argives !
1	so you above all must speak your mind , and listen , and carry out the next man 's counsel too , whenever his spirit leads him on to speak for the public good
1	or throw some earth on my body—you know you can— sail back to velia ’ s port
1	so old nestor urged and the fighting spirit leapt inside patroclus — he dashed back by the ships toward achilles
1	she pinned them across her breasts with a golden brooch then sashed her waist with a waistband floating a hundred tassels , and into her earlobes , neatly pierced , she quickly looped her earrings , ripe mulberry-clusters dangling in triple drops and the silver glints they cast could catch the heart
1	so i believe and if i can read the future with any truth , i welcome him as ours
1	now you see before you xanthus and troy in replica , built with your own hands , under better stars , i trust , and less exposed to the greeks
1	but now commit our friends ’ unburied bodies to the earth , their only tribute down in the depths of hell
1	he ’ d given himself up , with one goal in mind : to open troy to the greeks and lay her waste
1	but across the lines aeneas called his comrades , glancing fast at deiphobus , paris , brave agenor , all the trojan captains who backed aeneas here , and fighters followed close behind like flocks that follow the lead ram , leaving the pastureland to drink at springs , and the shepherd 's heart exults
1	so grand , the temple of the gods where king latinus assumed his fathers ’ throne and summoned the trojans to him in the halls
1	— what is the mighty zeus 's daughter blazing after now ?
1	why , even now athena was speeding the fatal day when he would fall to the power of great achilles
1	this must be our message
1	sooner the racing dogs will eat him raw !
1	hecate held back nothing , put you in charge of avernus ’ groves
1	the blood of my comrades froze with instant dread
1	suddenly iulus shouted : what , we ’ re even eating our platters now ?
1	but i would like the leading captains to remain
1	but sarpedon 's loyal comrades laid him down , a man like a god beneath a fine spreading oak sacred to zeus whose shield is banked with clouds
1	that is your duty , a service that becomes you
1	so the right hand you want is clasping yours
1	or if there ’ s a way and your goddess mother makes it clear—for not without the will of the gods , i ’ m certain , do you strive to cross these awesome streams and stygian marsh— give me your pledge , your hand , in all my torment !
1	but the cave and giant palace of cacus lay exposed and his shadowy cavern cleaved wide to its depths— as if earth ’ s depths had yawned under some upheaval , bursting open the locks of the underworld ’ s abodes , revealing the livid kingdom loathed by the gods , and from high above you could see the plunging abyss and the ghosts terror-struck as the light comes streaming in
1	but may the gods , if there are powers who still respect the good and true , if justice still exists on the face of the earth , may they and their own sense of right and wrong bring you your just rewards
1	hippolochus ' brawny son was scrambling up the wall when teucer 's arrow winged him from high aloft , just where he saw his shoulder blade laid bare , and stopped his lust for battle
1	but it took twins — one with the reins rock-steady , holding them rock-steady , the other lashed the team
1	hungry as wolves that rend and bolt raw flesh , hearts filled with battle-frenzy that never dies — off on the cliffs , ripping apart some big antlered stag they gorge on the kill till all their jaws drip red with blood , then down in a pack they lope to a pooling , dark spring , their lean sharp tongues lapping the water 's surface , belching bloody meat , but the fury , never shaken , builds inside their chests though their glutted bellies burst — so wild the myrmidon captains , myrmidon field commanders swarming round achilles ' dauntless friend-in-arms
1	some gaze wonderstruck at the gift for pallas , the virgin never wed—transfixed by the horse , its looming mass , our doom
1	a deathless goddess — so she strikes our eyes !
1	nor will you , oebalus , go unsung in our songs
1	there harpalion charged menelaus — king pylaemenes ' son who would followed his father into war at troy but he never reached his fatherland again
1	turnus , the victor , commandeered the rest
1	now all these gifts will be handed you at once
1	— if now , in fact , the black cloud of the trojans blasts down on the ships with full gale force , our backs to the breaking surf but clinging still to a cramped strip of land — the argives , lost
1	and glaucus sensed it all and the man glowed with joy that the mighty god had heard his prayer so quickly
1	and so the promised day had arrived and the fates filled out the assigned time , when turnus ’ rampage warned the mother to drive his brands from her consecrated ships
1	then my father , mulling over our old traditions , answers : lords of troy , learn where your best hopes rest
1	it 's all for him , this merciless battle pitched before the ships
1	wind-quick iris curbed the team and loosing them from the chariot threw ambrosial fodder down before their hoofs
1	some put shoulders to giant grains and thrust them on , some dress the ranks , strictly marshal stragglers , and the whole trail seethes with labor
1	what do the dead souls want ?
1	troy is toppling from her heights
1	myself — a terrible longing drives me , heart and soul , down to the ships , into the vast achaean camp
1	apollo the archer stood beside him , taunting , hector , son of priam , why so far from your troops ?
1	not till i let loose my shout — then halt your withering fire !
1	well you know , old soldier loved by the gods , what sort of man he is — that great and terrible man
1	pull back at once , whenever you are thrown against him — or go down to the house of death against the will of fate
1	but the long-haired argive archers aimed at hector , trying to cut him down with arrows , hurling rocks till king agamemnon cried out in a ringing voice , hold back , argives !
1	he ’ d shouted some great boast , trusting his strength would match his words , probably lifting his spirits sky-high and promising gray hairs for himself and a ripe old age— as aeneas faced down tarquitus gloating in burnished gear and born to faunus , god of the woods , by the wood-nymph dryope
1	you are the only image of my astyanax that ’ s left
1	out in the lead , ascanius , still heading his horsemen , still in triumph , swerves for the ships at full tilt , his breathless handlers helpless to rein him back , and finding the camp in chaos , shouts out : madness , beyond belief !
1	lay down your swords !
1	that instant he launched an eagle — truest of zeus 's signs that fly the skies — a fawn clutched in its talons , sprung of a running doe , but he dropped it free beside the handsome shrine where achaean soldiers always sacrificed to zeus whose voice rings clear with omens
1	but in days to come do not let this quarrel breed some towering clash between us both , pitting you and me in conflict
1	but the lapiths still kept fighting , slaughtering on
1	we will let hector see if the spear in my hand is mad for bloodshed too !
1	aeneas , as rumor has it and posted scouts report , has recklessly sent his light horse on ahead to harass the plains , while he himself , crossing the mountain heights by a lonely , desolate ridge , he ’ s moving on the city
1	some are hung splayed out , exposed to the empty winds , some are plunged in the rushing floods—their stains , their crimes scoured off or scorched away by fire
1	— teucer 's arrow hitting the gleaming belt that cinched his body-shield around his chest — but zeus brushed from his son the deadly spirits : not by the ships ' high sterns would his sarpedon die
1	this is the realm of shadows , sleep and drowsy night
1	suddenly , surprising all , he tells the queen : here i am before you , the man you are looking for
1	and now , as her feet swept her toward olympus , ranks of achaeans , fleeing man-killing hector with grim , unearthly cries , reached the ships and the hellespont 's long shore
1	but now sarpedon , watching his comrades drop and die , war-shirts billowing free as patroclus killed them , dressed his godlike lycians down with a harsh shout : lycians , where 's your pride ?
1	nor do his children ride his knees with cries of 'father ' — home at last from the wars and heat of battle
1	three times she tried to struggle up on an elbow , three times she fell back , writhing on her bed
1	then , then you will glut the dogs and birds of troy with your fat and flesh — cut down by the beaked ships !
1	take your stand on the rampart here , before you orphan your son and make your wife a widow
1	the foam flecked his mouth and his eyes shot flame , glaring under his shaggy brows and round his head his helmet shook and clashed , a terrific wild din — hector on the attack !
1	at daybreak king agamemnon ordered parties of men and mules to haul in timber , pouring from the tents with a good man in charge , the lordly idomeneus ' aide-in-arms meriones
1	what , sleep all night ?
1	caught by the full band , undone by the dark , the place , the treachery , sudden crashing attack—he ’ s overwhelmed , they ’ re dragging him off , struggling , desperate , doomed
1	so now i am your host and friend in the heart of argos , you are mine in lycia when i visit in your country
1	what if i did protest , forbid you to raze their walls ?
1	orodes darts away but mezentius would not stoop to killing him on the run with a spearcast from behind , stabbing him , unseen , no , he dueled him man to man , proving himself the better man by force of arms , not stealth , and next , stamping his foot on the corpse and leaning hard on the spear , mezentius shouts out : here , men , lies no mean part of their battle strength , orodes , once so tall !
1	now what suffering , now he 's lost his father — astyanax !
1	seeing them all , he groaned—glaucus , medon , thersilochus , antenor ’ s three sons and the priest of ceres , polyboetes , idaeus too , still with chariot , still with gear in hand
1	when it comes to men , great ajax yields to no one , no mortal who eats demeter 's grain , i tell you , one you can break with bronze and volleyed rocks
1	here , mars , power of war , injects new heart and force in the latins , twisting his sharp spurs in their chests and loosing flight and dark fear at the trojan ranks , and the latins swarm in from all directions , seize the moment for all-out assault as the war-god strikes their spirits
1	you fabii , where do you rush me , all but spent ?
1	but hippolochus fathered me , i am proud to say
1	fight like men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
1	shouting he led the charge and his armies swarmed behind with blood-chilling cries
1	not even his fury will let him crash our gates — he will never plunder troy
1	very well then , let us give way to the dark night , set out our supper , unyoke our full-maned teams and pile the fodder down before their hoofs
1	aeneas marveled , his keen eyes gazing round , entranced by the site , gladly asking , learning , one by one , the legendary tales of the men of old
1	he dug his heel in the corpse , yanked his own bronze out but as for the dead man 's burnished gear — no hope
1	they ’ d hardly stood her image up in the greek camp when flickering fire shot from its glaring eyes and salt sweat ran glistening down its limbs and three times the goddess herself—a marvel— blazed forth from the ground , shield clashing , spear brandished
1	these woods i gladly gave the dardan prince when the prince lacked a fleet— now dread and anguish have me in their grip
1	can nothing hold you back ?
1	there — he killed astynous , then hypiron , a frontline captain
1	even so , it is less the pain of the trojans still to come that weighs me down , not even of hecuba herself or king priam , or the thought that my own brothers in all their numbers , all their gallant courage , may tumble in the dust , crushed by enemies — that is nothing , nothing beside your agony when some brazen argive hales you off in tears , wrenching away your day of light and freedom !
1	as she inflames their grief , idaeus and actor , ordered by ilioneus and iulus weeping freely , cradle her in their arms and bear her back inside
1	ashes of ilium , last flames that engulfed my world— i swear by you that in your last hour i never shrank from the greek spears , from any startling hazard of war— if fate had struck me down , my sword-arm earned it all
1	still , turnus takes his birth from our own breed , his name too— pilumnus was his forebear , four generations back— and his lavish hand has heaped your threshold high with treasure troves of gifts !
1	they placed the bones they found in a golden chest , shrouding them round and round in soft purple cloths
1	or his father ’ s familiar spirit ?
1	stand up to them — ring great ajax , telamon 's son
1	and old king priam was first to see him coming , surging over the plain , blazing like the star that rears at harvest , flaming up in its brilliance , — far outshining the countless stars in the night sky , that star they call orion 's dog — brightest of all but a fatal sign emblazoned on the heavens , it brings such killing fever down on wretched men
1	but now paris spotted him stripping apisaon , drew his bow at eurypylus , fast — he shot well and the arrow struck him full in the right thigh but the shaft snapped , the thigh weighed down with pain
1	and now his lovely mother impelled aeneas to storm the ramparts , hurl his troops at the city—fast , frontal assault— and panic the latins faced with swift collapse
1	so the bravest man in the broad realm of troy took her hand in marriage , true , the very man poseidon crushed at the hands of idomeneus here , spellbinding his shining eyes , crippling his fine legs
1	the glory goes to him if the argive fighters lay the trojans low and take their sacred city , but immense grief is his if comrades die in droves
1	and lead on priam too , priam in all his power , so the king himself can seal our truce in blood — his royal sons are reckless , not to be trusted : no one must trample on the oath we swear to zeus
1	but keep this message firmly in your mind
1	but caesar in triple triumph , borne home through the walls of rome , was paying eternal vows of thanks to the gods of italy : three hundred imposing shrines throughout the city
1	the king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears : never again , old man , let me catch sight of you by the hollow ships !
1	sweeter than honey from his tongue the voice flowed on and on
1	i am not condemned to wicked tartarus , those bleak shades , i live in elysium , the luminous fields where the true and faithful gather
1	he had them sit in a great and growing circle — now for funeral games — and brought from his ships the trophies for the contests : cauldrons and tripods , stallions , mules and cattle with massive heads , women sashed and lovely , and gleaming gray iron
1	there at the tip she bound the gorgeous golden yoke , she fastened the gorgeous golden breast straps next and under the yoke queen hera led the horses , racers blazing for war and the piercing shrieks of battle
1	so down you go
1	and cassandra saw him too
1	all this — i would extend to him if he will end his anger
1	all the treasures that filled his hollow ships and the prince hauled home to troy — would to god he would drowned before that day !
1	no breathing space , no letup , not a moment , not till the night comes on to part the fighters ' fury !
1	but she had a dream one night
1	and back he sprang in the car and told his driver to make for the hollow ships , racked with pain but he loosed a shrill cry to all his men : friends — lords of the argives , o my captains !
1	do you really believe that ’ s what the dust desires , the ghosts in their ashen tombs ?
1	here vulcan had forged the nomad race , the africans with their trailing robes , here the leleges , carians , gelonian archers bearing quivers , euphrates flowing now with a humbler tide , the morini brought from the world ’ s end , the two-horned rhine and the dahae never conquered , araxes river bridling at his bridge
1	down off the ship 's stern he dropped , his back slamming the ground , his limbs slack in death , and ajax shuddered , calling out to his brother , teucer , my friend — our trusted comrade 's dead , mastor 's son who came our way from cythera
1	so glaucus prayed and apollo heard his prayer
1	when the fatal horse mounted over our steep walls , its weighted belly teeming with infantry in arms— she led the phrygian women round the city , feigning the orgiastic rites of bacchus , dancing , shrieking but in their midst she shook her monstrous torch , a flare from the city heights , a signal to the greeks
1	but zeus who marshals storm clouds lowered a dark glance and let loose at ares : no more , you lying , two-faced
1	but good aeneas , consoling them all with heartfelt words , weeps as he commends them to acestes , their blood kin
1	but next agamemnon killed pisander and combat-hard hippolochus , two sons of antimachus , that cunning , politic man whom paris bribed with gold and sumptuous gifts , so he was the first to fight the return of helen to red-haired menelaus
1	don ’ t withdraw from my sight
1	where could he find some breathing room in battle ?
1	the god had still to attach the inlaid handles
1	his plan won hector over — less danger , more success — and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground , calling out to polydamas brisk , winged orders : you stay here , hold back our captains here
1	inspired by treachery now or the fate of troy was moving toward this end
1	no light work for the teams that trundled chariots churning massive wheels to make it through in stride but the trojans strained to bring it off on foot
1	shadowy mountain ranges , seas that surge and thunder
1	there he made the earth and there the sky and the sea and the inexhaustible blazing sun and the moon rounding full and there the constellations , all that crown the heavens , the pleiades and the hyades , orion in all his power too and the great bear that mankind also calls the wagon : she wheels on her axis always fixed , watching the hunter , and she alone is denied a plunge in the ocean 's baths
1	this is no foot-race
1	the son of cronus , zeus , throned aloft in the heavens where he lives , zeus himself will brandish over their heads his black storm-shield , enraged at their deceit
1	over the brush , the quickest route , cross-country , armored fighters ride
1	i think , in fact , the favor of all the gods and juno ’ s backing drove these trojan ships on the winds that sailed them here
1	for the rest who followed , waking achaea 's war-lust , what man has spirit strong enough to sing their names ?
1	the cries are fiercer — fighters beside the ships !
1	let someone commit my body to the earth , snatched from battle or ransomed back for gold
1	look , zeus just drove the rest of my comrades off in panic flight
1	gone— and at last the night was over
1	whirling , killing coeranus , chromius and alastor , killing alcander and halius , prytanis and noemon — and stalwart odysseus would have killed still more but tall hector , his helmet flashing , marked him quickly , plowed through the front , helmed in fiery bronze , filling the argives ' hearts with sudden terror
1	so it must please his overweening heart , who knows ?
1	and she called her well-kempt women through the house to set a large three-legged cauldron over the fire so hector could have his steaming hot bath when he came home from battle — poor woman , she never dreamed how far he was from bathing , struck down at achilles ' hands by blazing-eyed athena
1	the rest of my brothers perished in that rout
1	think of a cloudburst bearing down with gusts of hail and every plowman , every farmhand quits the fields and the traveler keeps safe in a welcome refuge under some river ’ s banks or cavern ’ s rocky arch while rain pelts the earth , so when the sun returns they can all get on with the day ’ s work
1	we have cities too , in the land of sicily , arms and a king , acestes , born of trojan blood
1	deadly going , fighting now for all they were worth , staking all on their own strength and friends overhead as they ripped off rocks from the rampart 's sturdy ledge and hurled them down , defending themselves , their shelters , their fast ships — the rocks pelted the ground like snow that a sudden squall in fury , driving the dark clouds , heaps thick-and-fast on the earth that feeds us all
1	that man must be a king !
1	for the men of troy the day went down against their will but not the argives — what a blessing , how they prayed for the nightfall coming on across their lines
1	and now they might have won their journey home , the men of argos fighting the will of fate , yes , if hera had not alerted athena : inconceivable !
1	wild as a swollen river hurling down on the flats , down from the hills in winter spate , bursting its banks with rain from storming zeus , and stands of good dry oak , whole forests of pine it whorls into itself and sweeps along till it heaves a crashing mass of driftwood out to sea — so glorious ajax swept the field , routing trojans , shattering teams and spearmen in his onslaught
1	exchange shields with the greeks and wear their emblems
1	the glory of armor lit the skies and the whole earth laughed , rippling under the glitter of bronze , thunder resounding under trampling feet of armies
1	when you fight a man against the will of the gods , a man they have sworn to honor — then look out , a heavy wave of ruin 's about to overwhelm you
1	in his son 's command sailed forty long black ships
1	wasting blow after blow at each other , thrown but missed then blow , blow upon hollow ribs , landing fast and furious , pounding chestbones , flurry of blows to head and ears , jaws cracking under the crush of hammering jabs— massive entellus , stock-still in his tracks , merely rolls to avoid the salvos , eyes fixed on his rival
1	but the shining archer pandarus marked him storming down the plain , smashing the trojan lines before him
1	what land could please me more , and where would i rather beach our battered ships than sicily ?
1	spurring them on to raise their spears for full assault and the trojans ' fury massed and mounted , war cries broke but apollo suddenly stood by hector , shouting , do not for a moment duel achilles , hector , out in front of your ranks !
1	gathered round her sat the other immortal sea-nymphs while thetis amidst them mourned her brave son 's fate , doomed to die , she knew , on the fertile soil of troy , far from his native land
1	a son , as greeks will tell , of electra , that electra , daughter of atlas , mighty atlas who bears the grand orb of the heavens on his shoulders
1	meanwhile odysseus drew in close to chryse island , bearing the splendid sacrifice in the vessel 's hold
1	you will drive me into war with hera
1	then giant ajax and tactful royal odysseus
1	it ’ s right to break my sworn oath to the greeks , it ’ s right to detest those men and bring to light all they ’ re hiding now
1	her fury inflamed by all this , the daughter of saturn drove over endless oceans trojans left by the greeks and brute achilles
1	with that he whirled her round in his massive hand and flung her out of the brilliant , starry skies and she soon found herself in the world of men
1	what , shall we head for the sea— or troy ?
1	equipped with this , he spurs the winds and swims through billowing clouds till in mid-flight he spies the summit and rugged flanks of atlas , whose long-enduring peak supports the skies
1	there , pronous first to fall — a glint of the spear and patroclus tore his chest left bare by the shield-rim , loosed his knees and the man went crashing down
1	but phoebus apollo plucked him up in his hands and swathed him round in a swirling dark mist for fear some argive fast with chariot-team might hurl bronze in his chest and rip his life out
1	and when the victims ’ chests are splayed , dido , her lips parted , pores over their entrails , throbbing still , for signs
1	three calves to eryx , then a ewe to the god of storms— he orders killed , and the crewmen slip the cables , one after another
1	echeclus son of agenor next — achilles split his head at the brow with hilted sword so the whole blade ran hot with blood , and red death came plunging down his eyes , and the strong force of fate
1	with blood you must seek fair winds to sail you home , must sacrifice one more greek life in return
1	now home he 's gone to the dear land of his fathers , his warships empty , leaving behind the hero menelaus moldering in his wake !
1	no , do not give up now
1	but the two of you will never quit this fight , i would say , till one of you drops and dies and gluts with blood ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield !
1	then how could i pass up royal odysseus here ?
1	others disgrace themselves , so panicked they clamber back inside the monstrous horse , burying into the womb they know so well
1	aeneas suddenly glances back and beneath a cliff to the left he sees an enormous fortress ringed with triple walls and raging around it all , a blazing flood of lava , tartarus ’ river of fire , whirling thunderous boulders
1	i chafe to face my man , full force , though there 's not a scrap of mine for looting here , no cattle or gold the foe could carry off
1	chiefs of the argives armed in bronze , no orders for you — it 's wrong to incite you two , you lead your men to war in so much force
1	one declaimed in public , vowing payment in full — the other spurned him , he would not take a thing — so both men pressed for a judge to cut the knot
1	we — your allies here — we do your fighting for you
1	but go no further
1	do not harbor it deep inside you
1	the fourth battalion marched with gallant aeneas , anchises ' offspring flanked by antenor 's two sons , acamas and archelochus drilled for every foray
1	this time , true , menelaus has won the day , thanks to athena
1	but your own handsome war-gear lies in trojan hands , bronze and burnished — and hector in that flashing helmet , hector glories in your armor , strapped across his back
1	try to refrain from cheating your superiors
1	then over her brows athena placed her golden helmet fronted with four knobs and forked with twin horns , engraved with the fighting men of a hundred towns
1	never once did you arm with the troops and go to battle or risk an ambush packed with achaea 's picked men — you lack the courage , you can see death coming
1	you see for yourself , i know , how father zeus sends waves of ruin breaking down our lines — victory goes to troy
1	tydides hurled next , the bronze launched from his hand and not for nothing : hitting phegeus ' chest between the nipples it pitched him out behind his team
1	but of course—so turnus can fetch his royal bride— our lives are cheap , scattered in piles across the field , unburied and unwept
1	it 's all for him i have come to the ships now , to win him back from you — i bring a priceless ransom
1	i will never force the man to go
1	across the earth all other creatures were stretched out in sleep , easing their cares , their spirits blank to hardship
1	but when hecate put me in charge of avernus ’ groves she taught me all the punishments of the gods , she led me through them all
1	be at peace for now
1	so much for his plan
1	at that , hector spun and rushed from his house , back by the same way down the wide , well-paved streets throughout the city until he reached the scaean gates , the last point he would pass to gain the field of battle
1	all on attack— the armies wheeling around for combat , all the latins , all the trojans—mnestheus , fierce serestus , messapus breaker of horses , brawny asilas— the etruscan squadron , evander ’ s arcadian wings , each fighter at peak strength , all force put to the test as they soldier on , no rest , no letup—total war
1	come — lead off , if you can , with all your fighting power !
1	with that oath he raised his scepter high in the eyes of all the gods and idaeus turned , trailing back to sacred troy
1	and achilles ' only weapon patroclus did not take was the great man 's spear , weighted , heavy , tough
1	nothing for you to fear , no punishment to come
1	at that his brother dropped his bow in a shelter , slung a shield on his shoulder , four plies thick , over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror
1	their ships were drawn up far away from the fighting , moored in a group along the gray churning surf — first ships ashore they would hauled up on the plain then built a defense to landward off their sterns
1	no other achaean could have brought me round so soon , but seeing that you have suffered much and labored long , your noble father , your brother too — all for my sake — i will yield to your appeal , i will even give you the mare , though she is mine , so our people here will know the heart inside me is never rigid , unrelenting
1	at the heart of the house an ample altar stood , naked under the skies , an ancient laurel bending over the shrine , embracing our household gods within its shade
1	nor did pallas muster a slow , unwilling army there in pylos , all of us spoiling for a fight
1	sealing his pledge by the styx , his brother ’ s stream , by the banks that churn with pitch-black rapids , whirlpools swirling dark , he nodded his assent and his nod made all of mount olympus quake
1	to die , tell me , is that the worst we face ?
1	ares had to endure it , when giant ephialtes and otus , sons of aloeus , bound him in chains he could not burst , trussed him up in a brazen cauldron , thirteen months
1	nothing achieved by all our gifts , our gold , our fervent appeals
1	quickly — let each fighter sharpen his spear well , balance his shield well , feed his horses well with plenty of grain to build their racing speed — each man look well to his chariot 's running order , nerve himself for combat now , so all day long we can last out the grueling duels of ares !
1	you never give up the good fight , do you ?
1	some forces at some ships , some clashing at others , but hector charged head-on at ajax braced for battle and both warriors fought it out for a single vessel , nor could hector burst through and ignite the hull nor ajax drive him back — a god drove hector on
1	he dons messapus ’ helmet crested with tossing plumes
1	this order still on his lips , the god vanished from sight into empty air
1	and the one who proves the better man and wins , he will take those treasures fairly , lead the woman home
1	no doubt venus fears that treacherous house and the tyrians ’ forked tongues , and brutal juno inflames her anguish too and her cares keep coming back as night draws on
1	chromis led the mysian men with ennomus seer of birds — but none of his winged signs could beat off black death
1	for if your hands should violate this great offering to minerva , a total disaster—if only god would turn it against the seer himself ! —will wheel down on priam ’ s empire , troy , and all your futures
1	there on the spot his strength and life collapsed and blinding grief for the driver overpowered hector , stunned for his friend but he left him lying there and cried out to his brother cebriones close by , take the reins !
1	oh , italy , oh , what a rugged bastion you have lost , how great your loss , my iulus !
1	so this , this is the doom that strong fate spun out , our son 's life line drawn with his first breath — the moment i gave him birth — to glut the wild dogs , cut off from his parents , crushed by the stronger man
1	and round about they slaughter droves of cattle , carcasses offered up to death , and bristling swine and beasts led in from the fields are butchered over the flames
1	those two will flinch , they would never dare stand up to us man-to-man in all-out battle !
1	i will see to this
1	they are fighting over his corpse
1	but let achilles remain here , for the moment , much as his heart would race him into war
1	i dreamed i addressed him first , in tears myself i forced my voice from the depths of all my grief : oh light of the trojans—last , best hope of troy !
1	exhausted , we land at actium , trek to the little town
1	sound tactics — the captains hung on his words and all fell in line
1	here the clear commands of apollo call him back as the god impels us toward the tuscan tiber , the numicus ’ sacred springs
1	there strife took her stand , raising her high-pitched cry , great and terrible , lashing the fighting-fury in each achaean 's heart — no stopping them now , mad for war and struggle
1	i say have done with the man — whether he sails for home or stays on here
1	my legs no longer firm , my friend , dead on my feet , nor do my arms go shooting from my shoulders — the stunning punch , the left and right are gone
1	but she , her eyes fixed on the ground , turned away , her features no more moved by his pleas as he talked on than if she were set in stony flint or parian marble rock
1	the weapons you see are honed for our foes , the latins
1	holding her in his arms , he made for the ridges , wild , dense with woods , with enemy weapons raining down around them , volscian forces closing for the kill
1	his keen rutulians spur each other to arms , some moved by his matchless build and youth , some by his royal bloodline , some by his sword-arm ’ s shining work in war
1	but the lawful wife of menelaus , renowned menelaus , he will not give her up , paris makes that clear , though all troy commands him to do precisely that
1	and then , finally , meleager 's bride , beautiful cleopatra begged him , streaming tears , recounting all the griefs that fall to people whose city 's seized and plundered — the men slaughtered , citadel burned to rubble , enemies dragging the children , raping the sashed and lovely women
1	the father of men and gods , smiling down on her with the glance that clears the sky and calms the tempest , lightly kissing his daughter on the lips , replied : relieve yourself of fear , my lady of cythera , the fate of your children stands unchanged , i swear
1	not a ship in sight
1	there , you see that youth who leans on a tipless spear of honor ?
1	once they had borne him into the famous halls , they laid his body down on his large carved bed and set beside him singers to lead off the laments , and their voices rose in grief — they lifted the dirge high as the women wailed in answer
1	but that girl — you never block her way with a word or action , never , you spur her on , since you , you gave her birth from your own head , that child of devastation !
1	as for patroclus , there seemed no hope that achaeans could drag the corpse of achilles ' comrade out of range
1	things are bad , but that would be the best
1	you see the rutulians on the rampage ?
1	now down we go , united — review them as we pass
1	patroclus ordered automedon to yoke them quickly — a man he honored next to achilles breaker of men , always firmest in battle , nerved to wait the call
1	what of your sacred word ?
1	oh would to god you would died there , brought down by that great soldier , my husband long ago
1	you—what i won ’ t do !
1	your wish will be my command , trojan , i embrace your gifts
1	behold hector now — if you ever once rejoiced to see him striding home , home alive from battle !
1	hard by the camp it lay tied up , riding at anchor , shielded round by the high redoubts and river currents— here he attacks , shouting out to his cheering comrades : bring up fire !
1	men building their homes already , trusting the land already , their fleet abandoned now
1	as soon as they saw the tall ships gliding through the shadowed woods and the rowers bending to pull the oars in silence— alarmed by the unexpected sight , all rise as one to desert the sacred feast
1	even before now they would shake to see him coming
1	i bowed my head in assent that day the goddess thetis clutched my knees , begging me to exalt achilles scourge of cities
1	and with that he breathed fresh fire in the team
1	he pleaded with both kings , with clear good will , no more — or enormous sorrow comes to all achaea !
1	all or nothing now — die , or live and drive defeat from the ships !
1	camilla , keen to fix some trojan arms on a temple wall or sport some golden plunder out on the hunt , she tracked him now , one man in the moil of war , she stalked him wildly , reckless through the ranks , afire with a woman ’ s lust for loot and plunder when , grasping his chance at last , rising up from ambush arruns flings his spear with a winged prayer aloft : apollo , highest of gods , lord of holy soracte !
1	it 's found its home in an argive 's waiting flesh — a crutch in his grip , i would say , as he trudges down now to the house of death !
1	i set sail for italy— all against my will
1	and now they all come looming up before me , terrible shapes , the deadly foes of troy , the gods gigantic in power
1	not if you ventured down as far as the black abyss itself — i care nothing for you , you and your snarling anger , none in the world a meaner bitch than you
1	his wife went with him
1	beg the numidians , grovel , plead for a husband— though time and again i scorned to wed their like ?
1	don ’ t resist our welcome
1	you think that you , unburied , can lay your eyes on the styx ’ s flood , the furies ’ ruthless stream , and approach the banks unsummoned ?
1	on our backs , from the day that we were born , it seems that zeus has piled his pack of hardships
1	and next they killed pylaemenes tough as ares , a captain heading the paphlagonian shieldsmen , hot-blooded men
1	that splendid shield he gripped before his chest and shaking a pair of spears went stalking out like a mountain lion starved for meat too long and the lordly heart inside him fires him up to raid some stormproof fold , to go at the sheep , and even if he should light on herdsmen at the spot , guarding their flocks with dogs and bristling spears , the marauder has no mind to be driven off that steading , not without an attack
1	what shall i do ?
1	so , with a warm heart celebrate them with us now
1	and on their side the trojans put on harness too , mustering throughout the city , a smaller force but nerved to engage in combat even so — necessity pressed them to fight for sons and wives
1	and he will add a dowry , yes , a magnificent treasure the likes of which no man has ever offered with his daughter
1	mercury made ready at once to obey the great commands of his almighty father
1	my strength is too far gone for feats of arms
1	he told me to go through the rushing dark night , to patrol the enemy lines and learn at once if the fleet 's still guarded as before or now , battered down at our hands , huddling together , you plan a quick escape , your morale too low to mount the watch tonight — bone-weary from battle
1	i know for a fact the spirit in your heart is well-disposed to me and all my efforts
1	and the matchless runner reassured him : courage !
1	and many a fish , leaping up through the waves , breaking the cold ripples shivering dark will dart and bolt lycaon 's glistening fat !
1	i ’ ll sweep it all away , the mist so murky , dark , and swirling around you now , it clouds your vision , dulls your mortal sight
1	and there helen sat , helen the child of zeus whose shield is storm and lightning , glancing away , lashing out at her husband : so , home from the wars !
1	there was an ancient city held by tyrian settlers , carthage , facing italy and the tiber river ’ s mouth but far away—a rich city trained and fierce in war
1	he recalls at once the two lines of our race , two parents : his own error , his late mistake about ancient places
1	handmaids ran to attend their master , all cast in gold but a match for living , breathing girls
1	death is your last worry
1	devouring fire whipped by the winds goes churning into the rooftops , flames surging over them , scorching blasts raging up the sky
1	the goddess answered quickly , her eyes blazing , true , dear brother — how your father and mother both implored me , time and again , clutching my knees , and the comrades round me begging me to stay !
1	spirits lifting at dido ’ s welcome , brave achates and captain aeneas had long chafed to break free of the mist , and now achates spurs aeneas on : son of venus , what feelings are rising in you now ?
1	there they sat in assembly , trojans , dardans , all collected together , waiting long and tense for the herald to return
1	turn prows to land !
1	and iris racing the wind went veering off
1	father anchises crowned a great bowl with wreaths , brimmed it with unmixed wine , and standing tall in the stern , he prayed the gods : you powers that rule the land and sea and storms , grant us wind for an easy passage , blow us safe to port !
1	quick as a black swift darts along through the great halls of a wealthy lord , and scavenging morsels , banquet scraps for her chirping nestlings , all her twitterings echo now in the empty colonnades , now round the brimming ponds
1	the first to hurl , great ajax hit the ridge of the helmet 's horsehair crest — the bronze point stuck in acamas ' forehead pounding through the skull and the dark came swirling down to shroud his eyes
1	picture a shepherd tracking bees to their rocky den , closed up in the clefts he fills with scorching smoke and all inside , alarmed by the danger , swarming round through their stronghold walled with wax , hone sharp their rage to a piercing buzz and the black reek goes churning through their house and the rocks hum with a blind din and the smoke spews out into thin air
1	down he sat , flanking cronus ' son , gargantuan in the glory of it all , and the blessed gods were struck with terror then , they stopped shackling zeus
1	now aloft by the side of zeus the gods sat in council , conferring across olympus ' golden floor as noble hebe poured them rounds of nectar
1	over it no bird on earth could make its way unscathed , such poisonous vapors steamed up from its dark throat to cloud the arching sky
1	away with you , madman — damn you !
1	now with the squadrons marshaled , captains leading each , the trojans came with cries and the din of war like wildfowl when the long hoarse cries of cranes sweep on against the sky and the great formations flee from winter 's grim ungodly storms , flying in force , shrieking south to the ocean gulfs , speeding blood and death to the pygmy warriors , launching at daybreak savage battle down upon their heads
1	just think what he would do at sea where the fish swarm — why , the man could glut a fleet , diving for oysters !
1	i have never seen such men , i never will again
1	eurypylus staggered back to his massing comrades , dodging death , and shouted a stark piercing cry : friends — lords of the argives , all our captains !
1	and the bellows , all twenty , blew on the crucibles , breathing with all degrees of shooting , fiery heat as the god hurried on — a blast for the heavy work , a quick breath for the light , all precisely gauged to the god of fire 's wish and the pace of the work in hand
1	so iris , glistening dew , comes skimming down from the sky on gilded wings , trailing showers of iridescence shimmering into the sun , and hovering over dido ’ s head , declares : so commanded , i take this lock as a sacred gift to the god of death , and i release you from your body
1	agamemnon had a vessel hauled down to the sea , he picked out twenty oarsmen to man her locks , put aboard the cattle for sacrifice to the god and led chryseis in all her beauty amidships
1	bring two lambs — a white male and a black ewe for the sun and earth — and we will bring a third for zeus
1	where could i turn ?
1	brothers-in-arms , he and medon led the phthians , out in the forefront of those gallant soldiers fighting beside boeotians now to save the ships
1	how wrong we were when we said you had good sense
1	for i can ’ t believe , my brave one , you could bend to a stranger ’ s orders , bear a trojan master
1	up with the war cries , all together !
1	enemy at the gates now , while off in the distance much was under way , saturnian juno hurried iris down from the sky to turnus brash in arms , seated then by chance in a hallowed glen , his forebear pilumnus ’ grove
1	and still we engage him , trying to block his way with a word or show of force
1	cluster round patroclus , shoulder-to-shoulder , fight them at close range !
1	come under our roofs—our welcome guest
1	why , you can scheme to your heart 's content without a qualm in the world for me
1	but first go down to the house of death , the underworld , go through avernus ’ depths , my son , to seek me , meet me there
1	that duel , that deadly pact—i can not bear to watch
1	but a god goes with him always , beating off disaster — look , that 's ares beside him now , just like a mortal !
1	he placed it in his hands , and he was glad to have it
1	no doubt some mortal has suffered a dearer loss than this , a brother born in the same womb , or even a son
1	all wiped from your mind , all thought of food and bed ?
1	look at the vast achaean armies you command !
1	antilochus was the first to kill a trojan captain , tough on the front lines , thalysias ' son echepolus
1	why have you come ?
1	tense as a chalk-line marks the cut of a ship timber , drawn taut and true in a skilled shipwright 's hands — some master craftsman trained in athena 's school — so tense the battle line was drawn , dead even
1	shorten sail , change course
1	then the shouts break loose , and the banks and rapids round resound with the din , and the high sky thunders back
1	triple-plumed , his high helmet raises up a chimaera with all the fires of etna blasting from its throat and roaring all the more , its searing flames more deadly the more blood flows and the battle grows more fierce
1	and swelling his ranks , three hundred , all as one alert to obey his orders , men whose home is caere , men from minio ’ s fields , from ancient pyrgi and fever-racked graviscae
1	now , at last , let us turn our thoughts to supper
1	who could rightly call me beaten—you , you swine— who bothers to see the tiber crest with trojan blood and evander ’ s house uprooted , razed to the earth and all his arcadian fighters stripped of arms ?
1	that arruns should cut camilla down in sudden death : that he granted , true , but not that his noble land should see him home again and the gusting southwinds swept that prayer away
1	spotting them now the lord of men agamemnon dressed them down with a winging burst of scorn : you there , peteos ' son , a king , dear to the gods !
1	let any rugged fighter who shoulders a small buckler pass it on to a weaker man — put on the bigger shield
1	all you gods , you shared in the wedding rites , and so did you , apollo — there you sat at the feast and struck your lyre
1	laid low by a wound aimed for another , luckless man , he looks up at the heavens , longing for his dear argos as he dies
1	the swift runner replied in haste , so be it
1	only the god of death is so relentless , death submits to no one — so mortals hate him most of all the gods
1	i will do it all
1	and reaching odysseus first , a mastermind like zeus , the old driver roused him from sleep , shouting out , wake up !
1	staring grimly , the proud runner achilles answered , beg no more , you fawning dog — begging me by my parents !
1	antheus and mnestheus flank him closely , dashing on and from the deserted camp roll all their swarming ranks
1	their captain gone , camilla ’ s light horse squadrons are first to flee , the harried rutulians flee and brave atinas too , leaders routed , and front-line men , their leaders lost , make for safety , swerving their horses , racing for the walls
1	how could such an outrage slip from a father ’ s lips ?
1	but one heifer , deep in the vast cavern , lowed back and cacus ’ prisoner foiled its jailer ’ s hopes
1	a beloved , honored friend — but it 's been so long , your visits much too rare
1	once ashore , when you reach the city of cumae and avernus ’ haunted lakes and murmuring forests , there you will see the prophetess in her frenzy , chanting deep in her rocky cavern , charting the fates , committing her vision to words , to signs on leaves
1	look how you cringe in the face of menelaus , no great fighter before this — a weakling , soft
1	let him have no fear of death , no dread in his heart , such a powerful escort we will send him — the giant-killer hermes will guide him all the way to achilles ' presence
1	sons huddled round their father deep in the courtyard , robes drenched with tears , and the old man amidst them , buried , beaten down in the cloak that wrapped his body
1	so when he sent his javelin hissing through the air and all the volscians , wheeling , trained their eyes and alert minds on the princess , she was numb to it all , the draft , the hiss , the weapon sent from the blue—until the spear went ripping through her , under her naked breast and it struck deep , it hammered home and drank her virgin blood
1	a huge throng of the dead came streaming toward the banks : mothers and grown men and ghosts of great-souled heroes , their bodies stripped of life , and boys and unwed girls and sons laid on the pyre before their parents ’ eyes
1	please bear with me , hear me out
1	but immortal athena , her gray eyes wide , protested strongly : father !
1	so by the ships the other lords of achaea 's armies slept all night long , overcome by gentle sleep
1	what a far cry from the old hector home from battle , decked in achilles ’ arms—his trophies— or fresh from pitching trojan fire at the greek ships
1	if the fates had left me free to live my life , to arrange my own affairs of my own free will , troy is the city , first of all , that i ’ d safeguard , troy and all that ’ s left of my people whom i cherish
1	and here came caletor son of trojan clytius sweeping fire against the prow but famous ajax stopped him short with a spear that stabbed his chest
1	he cries and hurls his javelin into the sky— the opening shot of war—and high in his saddle races down the plain as his shouting comrades speed him on , riding in his wake with their war cries striking terror , amazed at the trojans ’ bloodless hearts , and calling : no trusting themselves to a level field of battle !
1	no , of all the cities under the sun and starry skies , wherever men who walk the earth have dwelled , i honor sacred ilium most with my immortal heart : priam and men of priam who hurls the strong ash spear
1	a great engine of battle ?
1	he slid from under the altar , glided up the tree and there the brood of a sparrow , helpless young ones , teetered high on the topmost branch-tips , cowering under the leaves there , eight they were all told and the mother made the ninth , she would borne them all — chirping to break the heart but the snake gulped them down and the mother cried out for her babies , fluttering over him
1	another contingent guard the gates and man the towers
1	he roars like blazing brush piled under the ribs of a billowing bronze cauldron— the water seethes in the heat and a river boils inside it , bubbling up in spume—the bowl can ’ t hold it , it overflows and a thick cloud of steam goes shooting into the air
1	this crag jutting over the ridge , leaning left of the river down below— he charged from the right and rocked it , prised it up from its bedrock , tore it free of its roots , then abruptly hurled it down and the hurl ’ s force made mighty heaven roar as the banks split far apart and the river ’ s tide went flooding back in terror
1	and all because of italy
1	but the giant ajax answered briskly , wait , idaeus , tell hector here to call the truce
1	fighting words , and diomedes was torn two ways — he would half a mind to turn the team and take him face-to-face
1	august , immense , its hundred columns soaring , the house commanded the city heights , laurentine picus ’ home with its shuddering grove and ancestral , awesome aura
1	from then on , ulysses kept tormenting me , pressing charge on charge ; from then on , he bruited about his two-edged rumors among the rank and file
1	as they closed on each other , both in range , the matchless runner achilles opened up : aeneas — why so far from your own ranks , standing all exposed ?
1	the son of atreus smoldered , glaring across at him , but nestor rose between them , the man of winning words , the clear speaker of pylos
1	and so , luring the headlong ares off the lines athena sat him down on scamander 's soft , sandy banks while argives bent the trojans back
1	his woolly sheep at his side , his sole pleasure , his only solace in pain
1	three times he tried to wrench it free , tugging madly , thrice gave up the struggle — the fourth with all his might he fought to bend aeacides ' shaft and break it off but before it budged the hero was all over him , slashing out his life , slitting his belly open — a scooping slice at the navel and all his bowels spilled out on the ground , darkness swirled his eyes as he gasped his breath away
1	next the grave aeneas flings a spear at mezentius— right through the buckler ’ s three round plates of bronze , through the linen plies and bull ’ s-hide triply stitched the spear pierced , plunging deep in the man ’ s groin but its force stopped short of home
1	a total rout — and white-armed hera saw it , and filled with pity the goddess ' words went winging toward athena : look , daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder — do not we care for them any longer ?
1	zeus made you a lion against all women , true , he lets you kill off mothers in their labor — but you will find it painful , matching force with me
1	how could any argive soldier obey your orders , freely and gladly do your sailing for you or fight your enemies , full force ?
1	stop , my glorious blazing boy !
1	this brusque command dispersed the muster quickly
1	she gave her servants orders and out they strode to gather the older noble women through the city
1	the flame keeps gnawing into her tender marrow hour by hour and deep in her heart the silent wound lives on
1	nothing could match its beauty — a masterpiece that skilled sidonian craftsmen wrought to perfection , phoenician traders shipped across the misty seas and mooring in thoas ' roads , presented to the king
1	if you no longer harbor any hope for our armies , if we are so alone , and at one repulse our forces are totally overwhelmed , good fortunes lost forever , let us reach out our helpless arms and plead for peace
1	latium ’ s sons will retain their fathers ’ words and ways
1	three ships the southwind grips and spins against those boulders lurking in mid-ocean— rocks the italians call the altars , one great spine breaking the surface—three the eastwind sweeps from open sea on the syrtes ’ reefs , a grim sight , girding them round with walls of sand
1	yes , but as soon as fiery-eyed athena marked them killing argive ranks in this all-out assault , down she rushed from the peaks of mount olympus straight for sacred troy
1	nothing — unless we do exactly as i say
1	i ’ ve seen him gnawing limbs , oozing dark filth , and the warm flesh twitching still between his grinding jaws
1	look , trailing those very manes along the ground
1	then , atrides , lead the way — you are the greatest king — spread out a feast for all your senior chiefs
1	shield your sister 's husband — if grief can touch your heart
1	better for me this way , poseidon too , to yield before my mighty hands — outraged as he is : not without sweat would we have called it quits
1	make yourself—you too—worthy to be a god
1	there they stood , pleading to be the first ones ferried over , reaching out their hands in longing toward the farther shore
1	now he ’ s dealing death to sthenelus , thamyris , pholus : sthenelus speared at long-range , the next two hand-to-hand , at a distance too both sons of imbrasus , glaucus and lades
1	but asius leapt down to defend his comrade , just ahead of his chariot-horses still held close by a driver , the team snorting , panting over his shoulders — asius strained in fury to spear idomeneus but the cretan took him first
1	as they reached the trench and rampart round the fleet , the sentries had just begun to set out supper there but the giant-killer plunged them all in sleep
1	have done at last
1	so we have heard in the famous deeds of fighting men , of heroes , when seething anger would overcome the great ones
1	first find lycia 's captains , range the ranks , spur them to fight and shield sarpedon 's body
1	by now the huntress had reached olympus heights and made her way to the bronze-floored house of zeus
1	no , not if i had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths and a voice of iron too—i could never capture all the crimes or run through all the torments , doom by doom
1	however the future years will exalt his actions : a patriot ’ s love wins out , and boundless lust for praise
1	and out before them all , two men took battle-stations , patroclus and automedon , seized with a single fury to fight in the comrades ' vanguard , far in front
1	and there in the bedroom hector came on paris polishing , fondling his splendid battle-gear , his shield and breastplate , turning over and over his long curved bow
1	and the sands grew wet , the armor of fighting men grew wet with tears , such bitter longing he roused
1	then they scattered , each to his own ship and shelter
1	the ruthless rock striking the bones and tendons crushed them to pulp — he landed flat on his back , slamming the dust , both arms flung out to his comrades , gasping out his life
1	and all day long they appeased the god with song , raising a ringing hymn to the distant archer god who drives away the plague , those young achaean warriors singing out his power , and apollo listened , his great heart warm with joy
1	next the veteran leonteus gave the weight a hurl , then ajax came up third and the giant flung it hard with his rippling brawny arm to pass all other marks
1	you think it nothing , the pain that zeus has sent me ?
1	now then , there 's a frontier fortress , thryoessa perched on cliffs , far off above the alpheus , at the edge of sandy pylos
1	you ’ ve seen the stallion turnus rides , the armor he sports , all gold—that mount , the shield , the blood-red plumes , i exempt from the lot
1	the argive trench could not hold out much longer , nor could the rampart rearing overhead , the wide wall they raised to defend the ships and the broad trench they drove around it all — they never gave the gods the splendid sacrifice the immortals craved , that the fortress might protect the fast ships and the bulking plunder heaped behind its shield
1	whatever can be done
1	back you will slink to our fast ships tomorrow , playing the spy again or fighting face-to-face
1	at his command they harnessed oxen and mules to wagons , they assembled before the city walls with all good speed and for nine days hauled in a boundless store of timber
1	and then , after we have eased our hearts with tears and dirge , we free the teams and all take supper here
1	two generations of mortal men he had seen go down by now , those who were born and bred with him in the old days , in pylos ' holy realm , and now he ruled the third
1	treating me like some vagabond , some outcast stripped of all my rights
1	and shattered with anger , the old man withdrew but apollo heard his prayer — he loved him , deeply — he loosed his shaft at the argives , withering plague , and now the troops began to drop and die in droves , the arrows of god went showering left and right , whipping through the achaeans ' vast encampment
1	and you , great son of atreus
1	his filth appalling , his beard all tangled , his rags hooked up with thorns
1	why so slow , trojan aeneas ?
1	the other 's aeneas , claims anchises ' blood , the noble anchises , but his mother 's aphrodite
1	i will tell it all
1	what is the crime if we seek far-off kingdoms too ?
1	the goddess fouled my finish !
1	hector lunged at ajax toe-to-toe , hacked his ash-wood pike with a heavy sword and striking the socket just behind the point he slashed the head clean off , leaving the shaft , the lopped stump dangling in ajax ' fist , useless , bronze head bounding away , clanging along the ground
1	watch , exulting here in the thick of carnage , an amazon , one breast bared for combat , quiver at hand—camilla—now she rifles hardened spears from her hand in salvos , now she seizes a rugged double axe in her tireless grasp , diana ’ s golden archery clashing on her shoulder
1	and here , close to the springs , lie washing-pools scooped out in the hollow rocks and broad and smooth where the wives of troy and all their lovely daughters would wash their glistening robes in the old days , the days of peace before the sons of achaea came
1	but aeneas , bound to his oath , his head exposed and the hand unarmed he was stretching toward his comrades , shouted out : where are you running ?
1	iphidamas , the rough and rangy son of antenor bred in the fertile land of thrace , mother of flocks
1	just call father back , bring him back to my eyes
1	— all those troubles we suffered here alongside troy , we alone of the gods when zeus dispatched us down to slave for proud laomedon one whole year , for stated wages — at that man 's beck and call
1	the curetes were fighting the combat-hard aetolians , armies ringing calydon , slaughtering each other , aetolians defending their city 's handsome walls and curetes primed to lay them waste in battle
1	you take on the etruscan cavalry—frontal assault , flanked by brave messapus , the latin horsemen and squadrons of tiburtus
1	and so both sides had clashed in the cruel thick-and-fast of war while aeneas plowed the sea in the dead of night
1	the guide and giant-killer answered quickly , you are right , old man , all straight to the mark
1	and olympian zeus the lord of lightning went to his own bed where he had always lain when welcome sleep came on him
1	the rank and file go back , withdraw to the ships , but we who claim to be the armies ' finest champions stand our ground — face him first , try to beat him off !
1	achilles now like inhuman fire raging on through the mountain gorges splinter-dry , setting ablaze big stands of timber , the wind swirling the huge fireball left and right — chaos of fire — achilles storming on with brandished spear like a frenzied god of battle trampling all he killed and the earth ran black with blood
1	we will fight again tomorrow , until some fatal power decides between our armies , handing victory down to one side or another
1	hector prays for the sacred dawn to break at once , he threatens to lop the high horns of our sterns and gut our ships with fire , and all our comrades pinned against the hulls , panicked by thick smoke , he will rout and kill in blood !
1	the snake slowly sweeping along his length among the bowls and polished goblets tasted the feast , then back he slid below the tomb , harmless , slipping away from altars where he ’ d fed
1	so now they ’ ve sailed away on the wind for home shores , just to rearm , recruit their gods as allies yet again , then measure back their course on the high seas and back they ’ ll come to attack you all off guard
1	ah , but if— and you often see such things in risky straits— if anything sends me down to death , some god , some twist of fate , you must live on , i say , you ’ re young , your life ’ s worth more than mine
1	it ’ s not for me to deny him his latin throne ?
1	now they are even fighting inside their gates , it ’ s combat cut-and-thrust , right on their own ramparts , trenches bathed in blood !
1	and menelaus whose cry could marshal armies urged both sides , now hear me out as well !
1	but back in lycaon 's halls are eleven war-cars , beauties all , fresh from the smith and fire-new and blankets spread across them
1	and next his entire army was moving out across the plain , rich in cavalry , rich in braided cloaks , bright gold
1	put up your fists , fight for what you are worth
1	if you can really keep your promise to priam now , who promised his daughter — a true blood-wedding day !
1	topping your crest the swan plumes toss , a fabulous mark of your father ’ s altered form , and all for offending you , love , you and venus
1	my descent the same as yours — crooked-minded cronus fathered me as well , the first of all his daughters , first both ways : both by birth and since i am called your consort and you in turn rule all the immortal gods
1	at last , when young dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more , the people massed around illustrious hector 's pyre
1	there — pirithous ' son the rugged polypoetes skewered damasus , pierced his bronze-sided helmet
1	but then again , the same beasts are trained to harness as teams and bow to the yoke , at one with bit and bridle
1	undaunted hercules had enough— furious , headlong down he leapt through the flames where the thickest smoke was massing , black clouds of it seething up and down the enormous cavern
1	but why debate , my friend , why thrash things out ?
1	just as he shot past the matchless runner achilles speared him square in the back where his war-belt clasped , golden buckles clinching both halves of his breastplate — straight on through went the point and out the navel , down on his knees he dropped — screaming shrill as the world went black before him — clutched his bowels to his body , hunched and sank
1	here little petelia built by philoctetes , the meliboean chief , lies safe behind its walls
1	covered him head to foot in a thin light sheet and over his body spread the white linen shroud
1	next antilochus slaughtered phalces , mermerus — meriones killed off morys , killed hippotion , teucer cut down periphetes and prothoon
1	protect me , escort me now — if the gods will it so — all the way till i reach achilles ' shelter
1	best to return at once , give the achaeans a full report , defeating as it is
1	he was pruning a young fig with his sharp bronze hook , cutting green branches to bend for chariot-rails when a sudden blow came down on him in the dark — the grim marauder achilles
1	but not yet did the argives give way to assault — no , they stopped the breaches up with oxhide shields and down from the breastwork heights they hurled rocks at the enemy coming on beneath the wall
1	full battle-gear , take up your slashing bronze lances
1	in his command sailed twelve ships , prows flashing crimson
1	he swept her up from ephyra , from the selleis river after he would ravaged many towns of brave young warlords bred by the gods
1	a piercing shriek — she reeled and dropped her son
1	i will give you a sign
1	here the god of the earthquake drove his horses down , he set them free of the yoke and flung before them heaps of ambrosia , fodder for them to graze
1	back i go to the shades to fill the tally out
1	come , follow my orders !
1	now , of course , we burn to question him , urge him to explain— blind to how false the cunning greeks could be
1	long before that , old age will overtake her in my house , in argos , far from her fatherland , slaving back and forth at the loom , forced to share my bed !
1	but how should i greet a young girl like you ?
1	and aeneas knows nothing , the man is miles away
1	the rutulians reel , looking about , but now nisus , all the bolder , watch , cocking another spear beside his ear as the enemy panics—hurls and the shaft goes hissing right through tagus ’ brow , splitting it , sticking deep in the man ’ s warm brains
1	a prayer to zeus
1	yes , we will keep clear of the war as you command
1	with that the dream departed , leaving him there , his heart racing with hopes that would not come to pass
1	then priam the son of dardanus rose among them , a man who could match the gods for strong advice , and with good will toward all he swayed his people : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies — i must speak out what the heart inside me urges
1	she entangles one man , now another
1	so ajax stood his ground over brave patroclus now — the fighting atrides right beside him , standing fast , his grief mounting , every waiting moment
1	do not go forth , a champion pitted against him — merciless , brutal man
1	so he mocked and the goddess fled the front , beside herself with pain
1	here , mourned in the world above and fallen dead in battle , sons of dardanus , chiefs arrayed in a long ranked line
1	arcadians throng to gateways , grasping funeral brands in the old archaic way
1	so each of you here must take what blows he sends
1	racing prothous led them on and in his command sailed forty long black ships
1	each man shouted out commands to his driver , quickly , rein the team by the trench , good battle-order now !
1	and any trojan so weighed down , so oppressed by his own possessions , let him collect the lot , pass them round to the people — a grand public feast
1	there is a city , corinth , deep in a bend of argos , good stallion-country where sisyphus used to live , the wiliest man alive
1	and the oarsmen don their wreaths of poplar leaves , oil poured on their naked shoulders makes them glisten
1	what need to tell of the lapiths , ixion , or pirithous ?
1	oh i know it , the son of cronus has terrified you — your everlasting husband !
1	mourning done , he commands his troops to lift the stricken body high and sends a thousand men , picked from the whole corps to escort the rites and join in the father ’ s tears
1	but white-armed andromache — hector could not find her in the halls
1	but the lord of men agamemnon sacrificed a fat rich ox , five years old , to the son of mighty cronus , zeus , and called the chiefs of all the argive forces : nestor first and foremost , then king idomeneus , the great and little ajax , tydeus ' son diomedes and odysseus sixth , a mastermind like zeus
1	he was the challenger , he with his lust for battle
1	to seaward , carians , paeonian men with bent bows , leleges and cauconians , crack pelasgians — inland , toward thymbra , camp the lycians , swaggering mysians , fighting phrygian horsemen , maeonian chariot-drivers — but why interrogate me down to the last platoon ?
1	aeneas the trojan , plucked from libya ’ s heavy seas
1	no laws of my native land can bind me here
1	the messenger with her rosy lips bestirred the king : turnus , what no god would dare to promise you— the answer to your prayers— time in its rounds has brought you all unasked
1	but did i give way ?
1	even forced to withdraw she swerves her bow and showers arrows , wheeling in full flight
1	what brings you to our house ?
1	we look for evander
1	not for a moment
1	then , for a fact , i now could end this agony , keep my brother company down among the shades
1	eternal peace , sealed with the bonds of marriage
1	he was lifting a golden cup and pouring wine , glistening wine to go with the glowing victim
1	why should i help troy ?
1	no one but agamemnon — he is the one who sent you for briseis
1	that would avenge what he has done to hector — no coward the man achilles killed — my son stood and fought for the men of troy and their deep-breasted wives with never a thought of flight or run for cover !
1	true , athena held her peace and said nothing
1	even palinurus , he swears he can ’ t tell night from day , scanning the heavens he finds nothing but walls of sea , the pilot ’ s bearings lost
1	but athena , her eyes afire , grabbed the flying shaft , flicked it over the car and off it flew for nothing — and after him diomedes yelled his war cry , lunging out with his own bronze spear and pallas rammed it home , deep in ares ' bowels where the belt cinched him tight
1	and aeneas froze there , terrified , taking in the din : what are the crimes , what kinds ?
1	enemies mixing in with their own ranks crowd them hard , nor can they find escape from a wretched death , no , right at the entrance , just in their native walls , in the safe retreat of home they ’ re pierced by spears and pant their lives away
1	one crew , stung by the shame of losing victory now with glory won , would trade their lives for fame
1	the enormous snake becomes the gold choker around her throat , the raveling end of a headband braiding through her hair , writhing over her body
1	i ask no more than the realm my fate decrees : let the trojans rest in latium , they and their roaming gods , their rootless powers !
1	there was a stag , a rare beauty , antlers branching , torn from his mother ’ s dugs
1	and with all his royal weight atrides thundered , antilochus — you used to have good sense !
1	but why in my torment hold the trojans back from battle ?
1	none dared remain at rest as zeus advanced , they all sprang up to greet him face-to-face as he took his place before them on his throne
1	lord of the lightning , king of the black cloud , what are you saying ?
1	his own son commands the sentry-line , he and idomeneus ' aide meriones
1	our men fight with him
1	watching , rigid , suddenly warmth leaves her bones , she faints , and after a long pause barely finds the breath to whisper : that face , it ’ s really you ?
1	there—never forget—your hands must labor to build your first houses , ring them round with mounds
1	i hold the gods to blame
1	shameless , inveterate — armored in shamelessness !
1	i ’ ve stood up against his weapons , we ’ ve gone man to man
1	from there they labor along the charted path and at last they gain the utmost outer fields where throngs of the great war heroes live apart
1	he quickly called hippolochus ' son : glaucus , why do they hold us both in honor , first by far with pride of place , choice meats and brimming cups , in lycia where all our people look on us like gods ?
1	though i never forgot my courage , i can tell you — not i , there at the front where we win glory , there i take my stand whenever a pitched battle rears its head
1	he balked at killing the man — he would some respect at least — but he quickly sent him off to lycia , gave him tokens , murderous signs , scratched in a folded tablet , and many of them too , enough to kill a man
1	olympian zeus himself had launched him into the clean light of day
1	and storming zeus was stirring up apollo : on with it now — sweep sarpedon clear of the weapons , phoebus my friend , and once you wipe the dark blood from his body , bear him far from the fighting , off and away , and bathe him well in a river 's running tides and anoint him with deathless oils
1	and here i am in a distant land , fighting trojans , and all for that blood-chilling horror , helen !
1	in fast reply tlepolemus raised his ashen spear and the same moment shafts flew from their hands and sarpedon hit him square across the neck , the spear went ramming through — pure agony — black night came swirling down across his eyes
1	the famed achilles towered over them all , he and the battle-team that bore the peerless son of peleus into war
1	if it really was achilles who reared beside the ships , all the worse for him — if he wants his fill of war
1	now what if one of them saw you , rolling blithely on through the rushing night with so much tempting treasure — how would you feel then ?
1	dug in , backs to the sea , land of our fathers far away !
1	the work done , the feast laid out , they ate well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
1	with that , the river sank low in his deep pool , heading down to the depths as aeneas , night and slumber over , gazing toward the sunlight climbing up the sky , rises , duly draws up water in cupped hands and pours forth this prayer to heaven ’ s heights : you nymphs , laurentine nymphs , you springs of rivers , and you , father tiber , you and your holy stream , embrace aeneas , shield him from dangers , now at last
1	the marshal made things clearer : you stay there — so we do not miss one another rushing back and forth in the endless maze of pathways up and down the camp
1	deiphobus stripped away the corpse 's gleaming helmet but quick as the god of war meriones leapt at him , stabbed his outstretched arm and the blank-eyed helmet slipped from his grasp , pounding the ground and clanging
1	they were shaken , distracted men at priam 's gates but the clearheaded antenor opened up among them : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies , i must speak out what the heart inside me urges
1	i for one have no desire to battle zeus , not you and i and the rest of the gods together
1	zeus forbids you to fight for achaea 's armies !
1	nor would i cause your mother so much grief , dear boy
1	now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
1	but he eyed aeneas straight on , he dodged the bronze , ducking down with a quick lunge , and behind his back the heavy spearshaft plunged and stuck in the earth , the butt end quivering into the air till suddenly rugged ares snuffed its fury out , dead still
1	diomedes killed off axylus , teuthras ' son who had lived in rock-built arisbe , a man of means and a friend to all mankind , at his roadside house he would warm all comers in
1	fast to the left hand he straps the brazen shield and down from the neck he hangs the ivory-hilted sword
1	ladon he butchers , pheres , demodocus— a flash of his sword and he slices off strymonius ’ hand just as it clutched his throat
1	you wo not persuade me
1	but already clutching a shaft while teucer aimed meriones leapt to snatch the bow from his hand and quickly swore to the distant deadly archer he would slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs — up under the clouds he glimpsed the fluttering dove and there as she wheeled he hit her right beneath the wing and straight through the heart and out the arrow passed , plunged at meriones ' foot and stabbed the earth hard
1	who ’ s with me , men , who ’ s first to attack the enemy ?
1	who could blame the achaeans for chafing , bridling beside the beaked ships ?
1	and he , he will launch his comrade patroclus into action and glorious hector will cut him down with a spear in front of troy , once patroclus has slaughtered whole battalions of strong young fighting men and among them all , my shining son sarpedon
1	so the two aeantes kept on beating the trojans off but on they came , assaulting the rear , two in the lead , aeneas the son of anchises flanking glorious hector
1	our best achaean 's dead — patroclus , a stunning loss to all our armies !
1	and let apollo drive prince hector back to battle , breathe power back in his lungs , make him forget the pains that rack his heart
1	come , nothing to fear , pull off your trojan gauntlets !
1	the man is raving — with all the murderous fury in his heart
1	so i take to the open sea , an exile outward bound with son and comrades , gods of hearth and home and the great gods themselves
1	now close beside him the bright-eyed goddess stood and urged him on : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician — what , is this the way ?
1	nevertheless , one day , when their tour of duty is done at last and they moor in a western haven , all the ships that survived the waves and bore the trojan prince to latium ’ s fields—i will strip them of mortal shape and command them all to be goddesses of the deep like doto , nereus ’ daughter , and galatea too , breasting high , cleaving the frothing waves
1	there they found the defenders packed , hard-pressed as the lycians ' stalwart lords and captains stormed like a black tornado up against the breastworks — both men flung themselves in attack , the war cries broke
1	at once tyrrhenus and fierce aconteus charge each other full tilt with their spears , and both are first to crash , shattering down with tremendous impact , splintering ribs of their battle stallions ramming chest to chest
1	now these horses you ask about , old soldier , they are newcomers , just arrived from thrace
1	obey my orders , for fear the gods , however many olympus holds , are powerless to protect you when i come to throttle you with my irresistible hands
1	venus leading , down from the roof i climb and win my way through fires and massing foes
1	powerful diomedes took his challenge quickly : i will stand and fight , by god , and take the worst but little joy it will bring our comrades now
1	we embark her too
1	but once the sun stood striding at high noon , then father zeus held out his sacred golden scales : in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low — one for the trojan horsemen , one for argives armed in bronze — and gripping the beam mid-haft the father raised it high and down went achaea 's day of doom , achaea 's fate settling down on the earth that feeds us all as the fate of troy went lifting toward the sky
1	he knew that zeus had tipped the scales against him
1	with that he vanished into the black night
1	how each man weaves his web will bring him to glory or to grief
1	the work done , the feast laid out , they ate well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
1	that thracian , once the power of troy was shattered , our trojan fortunes gone—he joins forces with agamemnon , siding with his victorious arms , and breaks all human laws
1	no lapse of time , no reverence , nothing tames her , no decree of jove or the fates can break her will , she never rests
1	halaesus rushes in with auruncan troops and messapus , neptune ’ s son , as well , the brilliant horseman
1	then each man , lifting his own two-handled cup , poured it out to the gods , and back they went along the ships , odysseus in the lead
1	oh it ’ s a long tale of crime , long , twisting , dark , but i ’ ll try to trace the high points in their order
1	the trojans broke our binding truce just now — death and grief to the men of troy hereafter !
1	and then , last , achilles drew his father 's spear from its socket-stand — weighted , heavy , tough
1	just now tipping wine to her husband ’ s ashes , she implored hector ’ s shade to visit his tomb , an empty mound of grassy earth , crowned with the double altars she had blessed , a place to shed her tears
1	so back i go to give achilles the message
1	either we pluck the man from death and save his life or strike him down at last , here at achilles ' hands — for all his fighting heart
1	so now the argives drove the ravening fire clear of the warships , winning a little breathing room , not much , no real halt to the buck-and-rush of battle
1	but there stands turnus now , and amid their hot fury and rising cries of murder , he fires up their fears : trojans are called to share our realm !
1	pitifully his loving father groaned and round the king his people cried with grief and wailing seized the city — for all the world as if all troy were torched and smoldering down from the looming brows of the citadel to her roots
1	you can hear the groaning anvils boom with mighty strokes , the hot steel ingots screeching steam in the cavern ’ s troughs and fires panting hard in the furnace—vulcan ’ s home , it bears the name vulcania
1	gearing for battle , are you ?
1	look at you , carrying on in the armies ' muster just like boys — fools !
1	you , you at troy in the halls of king priam — i at thebes , under the timberline of placos , eetion 's house
1	she speaks out first : you there , young soldiers , did you by any chance see one of my sisters ?
1	you ’ re beaten , now retreat !
1	a crash of thunder !
1	but look , the merciless wife of jove was winging back from argos , inachus ’ city , holding course through the heavens when , from far in the air , as far as sicily ’ s cape pachynus , she spied aeneas exulting , trojan ships at anchor
1	but the king kept ranging , battling ranks on ranks and thrusting his spear and sword and hurling heavy rocks so long as the blood came flowing warm from his wound
1	o give him back at once — take ransom for the dead !
1	but on came hector 's team in the rush-and-buck of battle , sweeping their driver hector on in fighting-fury and then and there old nestor would have died if diomedes had not marked him fast — the lord of the war cry gave a harrowing shout , trying to rouse odysseus : where are you running , the royal son of laertes , cool tactician ?
1	but since i was blinded and zeus stole my wits , i am intent on setting things to rights , at once : i will give that priceless ransom paid for friendship
1	she approaches her grieving sister , anna—masking her plan with a brave face aglow with hope , and says : i ’ ve found a way , dear heart—rejoice with your sister—either to bring him back in love for me or free me of love for him
1	as a snake in the hills , guarding his hole , awaits a man — bloated with poison , deadly hatred seething inside him , glances flashing fire as he coils round his lair
1	there his brothers and countrymen will bury the prince with full royal rites , with mounded tomb and pillar
1	they will go to achilles ' tent with all good speed
1	under his feet he fastened the supple sandals , never-dying gold , that wing him over the waves and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds
1	who ’ d meet his doom ?
1	this is the ninth year come round , the ninth we have hung on here
1	then tros , alastor 's son , crawled to achilles ' knees and clutched them , hoping he would spare him , let tros off alive , no cutting him down in blood , he would pity tros , a man of his own age — the young fool , he would no idea , thinking achilles could be swayed !
1	and king agamemnon took his lead , saluting : again , old man , you outfight the argives in debate !
1	quick at zeus 's side the famous lord of earthquakes freed the team , canted the battle-chariot firmly on its base and wrapped it well with a heavy canvas shroud
1	now i say this to our stallion-breaking trojans , i say no , straight out — i wo not give up the woman !
1	rumor , vicious as ever , brings her word , already distraught , that trojans are rigging out their galleys , gearing to set sail
1	what hope has the common soldier in your ranks to be saved by you , hector , you heart of iron ?
1	fifty fighters aboard each , manning the oarlocks , five captains he named , entrusted with command , but he himself in his martial power ruled them all
1	in naked daylight i am determined now to ring their walls with fire !
1	asaeus first , autonous next and then opites , dolops , clytius ' son , and opheltius , agelaus , aesymnus and orus , hipponous staunch in combat
1	bright as the morning star whom venus loves above all the burning stars on high , when up from his ocean bath he lifts his holy face to the lofty skies and dissolves away the darkness
1	keep the team close by !
1	with that the dream went winging off and soothing sleep released me
1	command us , where do we settle now ?
1	old menoetes , dead weight in his sodden clothes , struggling up at last from the depths to break the surface , clambered onto the rock and perched there high and dry
1	again and again he fought for breath , gasping , bathed in sweat rivering down his body , his limbs soaked and sleek
1	and loosing a savage yell , hector led the way and his captains followed close with unearthly cries and trojan ranks behind them crying shrill
1	from there—if i recall what i heard—our first father , teucer sailed to troy , cape rhoeteum , picked the point and founded his kingdom on those shores
1	dolon answered , his legs shaking under him , hector — he duped me so — so many mad , blind hopes !
1	and veteran menelaus cringed himself but saw the lashing-cords and barbs outside the gash and his courage flooded back inside his chest
1	a shudder swept all ranks , trojans and argives both , terror-struck by the shriek the god let loose , ares whose lust for slaughter never dies
1	it 's good-for-nothing — he 's torn your wits away
1	yes , i gave birth to a flawless , mighty son
1	so he yielded but now the roar of flames grows louder all through troy and the seething floods of fire are rolling closer
1	but giant ajax would never fail his fallen brother — he ran to straddle and hide him with his shield as a brace of comrades shouldered up the fighter : echius ' son mecisteus helping good alastor bore him back to the hollow warships , groaning hard
1	like fires loosed from adverse sides into woodlands dry as tinder , thickets of rustling laurel , or foaming rivers hurling down from a mountain ridge and roaring out to sea , each leaves a path of destruction in its wake
1	to my brothers ' wives with their long flowing robes ?
1	now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth , now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes round again
1	once is enough for him
1	why , they would scuttle home before they can even learn if the vows of zeus with his dark cloudy shield are false or not
1	lunging out he whips a spear at the foes he faced and the whizzing javelin hisses , rips the air dead-on— and at that instant a huge outcry , ranks in a wedge in disarray , lines buckling , hearts at a fever pitch as the shaft wings on where a band of nine brothers with fine bodies chanced to block its course
1	how glad we are to see you , we battle-weary men , after so many deaths , your people dead and gone , after your citizens , your city felt such pain
1	neptune , you yourself , you ’ re my witness to what great instant chaos she unleashed , just now , in libya ’ s heaving seas , mixing the sea and wind and backed by aeolus ’ blasts , all for nothing , but all dared in your own realm
1	will agamemnon win me over ?
1	like a shooting star athena flashed across the earth , plunging down in the midst of both camped forces
1	find them he did , no longer free of wounds , unhurt — not at all
1	turnus , the great captain , is blazing on in another zone , stampeding the trojan ranks when the news arrives : the enemy flushed with the latest carnage offers up their gates flung open now
1	the argives rose in horror to hear that boast , veteran ajax most of all , the anger leapt inside him — prothoenor had dropped at the feet of telamon 's son
1	he waits by the ships , a man never sated with battle
1	friendship is much better
1	mad , blind i was !
1	impelled by the great omen , hearts filled with joy , they rush to refresh the banquet , set out bowls and crown the wine with wreaths
1	for that alone he waited , the god who rules the world , to see with his own eyes the first achaean ship go up in a blaze of flames
1	maybe they have whipped us here but not without a fight will they take our benched ships
1	but no false respect
1	hector , helmet flashing , answered nothing
1	then back to troy they bore him , groaning hard
1	you call on the winds to sweep you there by sea ?
1	the boys are now called troy , their troupe the trojan corps
1	and how we spent that last night , lost in deluded joys , you know
1	let it be quite enough for fate and venus both that trojans reach the rich green land of italy— trojans !
1	so i take my plunder — spears , bossed shields , helmets and breastplates , gleaming , polished bright
1	and i as i walk , i recognize a little troy , a miniature , mimicking our great trojan towers , and a dried-up brook they call the river xanthus , and i put my arms around a cutdown scaean gate
1	he could bear no more , wheeling off at a distance — shaking his whetted spear he charged achilles now , coming fierce as fire but achilles marked him quickly and springing forth to take him , triumphed to himself , here is the man who 's raked my heart the most , who killed my cherished comrade !
1	come now , i will give you one of the younger graces — wed her at once and she will be called your wife
1	shipmates race each other , thrashing the waves and a rising sternwind surges , drives the vessels on
1	turnus , struck with love , fixing his eyes upon her , fired the more for combat , tells amata , briefly : don ’ t , i beg you , mother , send me off with tears , with evil omens as i go into the jolting shocks of war , since turnus is far from free to defer his death
1	but father , suspecting at once , cursed me roundly , he screamed out to the cruel furies — 'never , never let me bounce on my knees a son of his , sprung of his loins !
1	mother bore them both
1	the outlaw , the adulterer
1	find him he did , lycaon 's skilled , fearless son , and went right up and challenged him to his face : pandarus , where 's your bow , your winged arrows , your archer 's glory ?
1	wild as a storm cloud moving off olympus into heaven out of a clear blue sky when zeus brings cyclones on — so wild the rout , the cries that came from the ships as back through the trench they ran , formations wrecked
1	what more does he want ?
1	then all that night the long-haired achaeans feasted as trojans and trojan allies took their meal in troy
1	they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they had put aside desire for food and drink , priam the son of dardanus gazed at achilles , marveling now at the man 's beauty , his magnificent build — face-to-face he seemed a deathless god
1	oh what fate has overpowered you , robbed of such a husband ?
1	so they prayed as the old horseman shook the lots and one leapt from the helmet , the one they wanted most — great ajax ' lot it was
1	whatever you ’ ve started , set it aside , my cyclops of etna , bend to this !
1	captains of all achaeans !
1	speak up , from right where you are , not one step more !
1	so things went in latium
1	rein your anger in !
1	so the ship limped in , oars laboring , slowly , and still she spreads her sails and enters the harbor , canvas taut
1	let no man quit the battle !
1	lash those pounding stallions straight at patroclus — you might kill him still — apollo might give you glory !
1	ardea , our forebears called the place in the old days , and the mighty name of ardea still stands firm but its glory is gone forever
1	the spear goes flying on and it hits the armor high up where the bronze rims the shoulder ’ s ridge , and glancing off , it rams its way through the shield ’ s plies and finally scrapes the skin of turnus ’ massive body
1	even before the contest ended , great aeneas calls epytides over , friend and bodyguard of the young iulus , and whispers in his trusted ear : go , and if ascanius has his troupe of boys prepared , their horses mustered to ride through their maneuvers , have him parade his squadrons now , to honor anchises here and display himself in arms
1	waiting , tense , he probed his own brave spirit : ah dear god — if i run from achilles ' onslaught , taking the route the rest have fled , stampeding , he will catch me even so and slash my coward 's throat
1	i warn you both — so help me it 's the truth — no more grooming for you at nestor 's hands !
1	mothers scatter in panic down the palace halls and embrace the pillars , cling to them , kiss them hard
1	hector , i urge you first of all — do as i tell you
1	and hector too — how could he hold back with his massing , armored trojans ?
1	i wish hector had killed me , the best man bred in troy — the killer a hero then and a hero too the man whose corpse he stripped !
1	they saw zeus turn the tide toward the trojans
1	you would set him free from all the pains of death ?
1	you are both great fighters — we all know that full well
1	dolon leapt to it , he quickly slung a reflex bow on his back , over it threw the pelt of a gray wolf and set on his head a cap of weasel skin and taking a sharp spear , moved out from camp , heading toward the fleet — but he was never to come back from the enemy 's beaked ships , bringing hector news
1	seeing priam decked in the arms he ’ d worn as a young man , are you insane ?
1	this was juno ’ s goal from the start , and so she nursed her city ’ s strength
1	she stood on odysseus ' huge black-bellied hull , moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings , upshore to telamonian ajax ' camp or down to achilles ' — trusting so to their arms ' power and battle-strengththey would hauled their trim ships up on either flank
1	once he has fitted shield to hip and harness to his back , he clasps ascanius fast in an iron-clad embrace and kissing him lightly through his visor , says : learn courage from me , my son , true hardship too
1	they had no love for stand-and-fight encounters — had no crested bronze helmets to guard their heads , no balanced shields in their grasp , no ashen spears , only their bows and slings of springy , twisted wool
1	under his brows he glared at royal hector , shouting , quick , charge me — the sooner to meet your death !
1	stave off his hunger now
1	staunch as a pillar planted tall above a barrow , standing sentry over some lord or lady 's grave-site , so they stood , holding the blazoned chariot stock-still , their heads trailing along the ground , warm tears flowing down from their eyes to wet the earth
1	he stood in awe of his mother 's strict command
1	i have just come up from the ships to scout the plain — at dawn the fiery-eyed achaeans fight around the city
1	so at last we avenged our comrades ’ shades—elated
1	both born to the same fate after all !
1	menelaus took the hardened captain hyperenor , gouged his flank and the bronze ripped him open , spurting his entrails out — and his life , gushing forth through the raw , yawning wound , went pulsing fast and the dark came swirling down across his eyes
1	then the men who lived in buprasion , brilliant elis , all the realm as far as hyrmine and myrsinus , frontier towns and olenian rock and alesion bound within their borders
1	off in his beaked seagoing ships achilles lies , raging away at agamemnon , marshal of armies — but here we are , strong enough to engage you , and plenty of us too
1	now over the high seas we raise up woody zacynthos , dulichium , same , neritos ’ crags , past ithaca ’ s rocky coast we race , laertes ’ realm , cursing the land that spawned the vicious ulysses
1	i can see the blaze go roaring up the ships
1	go , give him my message , start to finish — and see that every word of it rings exactly so
1	come , help me unroll the massive scroll of war !
1	and once they reached the plains of troy where the two rivers flow , where simois and scamander rush together , the white-armed goddess hera reined her team , loosing them from the chariot-yoke and round them poured a dense shrouding mist and before their hoofs the simois sprang ambrosial grass for them to graze
1	what i needed was men to shield our helpless children , fighting men to defend our trojan women — all-out — against these savage argives
1	where are the younger troopers now we need them ?
1	in all this slaughter he slips away , taking flight to rutulian soil , shielded by turnus ’ armies , his old friend
1	but look—clausus , born of the age-old sabine blood , heading a mighty force , a mighty force himself
1	king latinus , already old , had governed the fields and towns through long years of peace
1	now the goddess dawn climbed up to olympus heights , declaring the light of day to zeus and the deathless gods as the king commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and muster the long-haired achaeans to full assembly
1	acestes is our host
1	and there in the midst the grand , glowing cup the old king brought from home , studded with golden nails , fitted with handles , four all told and two doves perched on each , heads bending to drink and made of solid gold and twin supports ran down to form the base
1	but his brothers , a phalanx up in arms , enflamed by grief , some tear swords from sheaths and some snatch up their spears and all press blindly on
1	wherever camilla rages , plunging into the front , there arruns stalks her , quietly tracks her steps ; whenever she downs a foe and turns around for home , round he tugs at his fast reins and ducks from sight
1	a nightmare hovered above his head that night — diomedes himself !
1	he plowed forward , testing enemy lines at all points to see if they would crack before him — charging under his shield but he could not overpower the argives ' stiff resolve and ajax hulking forward with big strides , the first to challenge hector : madman !
1	a messenger brought me word from zeus — my mother , thetis who bore me , the old man of the sea 's daughter
1	if not , i swear , atrides could never have roused the fury in me , the rage that would not die , or wrenched the girl away against my will — stubborn , implacable man
1	the horse stands open wide , fighters in high spirits pouring out of its timbered cavern into the fresh air : the chiefs , thessandrus , sthenelus , ruthless ulysses rappeling down a rope they dropped from its side , and acamas , thoas , neoptolemus , son of achilles , captain machaon , menelaus , epeus himself , the man who built that masterpiece of fraud
1	but turnus , balancing long his oakwood spear with its iron tip , flings it at pallas with winging words : now we ’ ll see if my spear pierces deeper !
1	there — aeneas lunged and speared leocritus through , a son of arisbas , lycomedes ' die-hard friend
1	their own bravado killed them
1	aeneas challenges me alone ?
1	so swiftly juturna drives her team at the trojan center , darts along in her chariot whirling through the field , now here , there , displaying her brother in his glory , true , but she never lets him come to grips , she swerves far away
1	laocoön , the priest of neptune picked by lot , was sacrificing a massive bull at the holy altar when—i cringe to recall it now—look there !
1	and you , odysseus , i tell you , i command you : pick out young men , the best in our joint forces , bring forth the gifts from my ship , all we promised achilles just the other day , and bring the women too
1	were i passing the hours , an exile lost in the swirling sands of carthage or caught in greek seas , imprisoned in mycenae , i would still perform my anniversary vows , carry out our processions grand and grave and heap the altars high with fitting gifts
1	they were fighting far afield of the deep-sea ships , beneath the trojan wall , so achilles never feared his friend was dead — he must be still alive , pressing on to the very gates , but he would come back
1	all at once , as he took to heart the struggles he beheld , venus approached in rare sorrow , tears abrim in her sparkling eyes , and begged : oh you who rule the lives of men and gods with your everlasting laws and your lightning bolt of terror , what crime could my aeneas commit against you , what dire harm could the trojans do that after bearing so many losses , this wide world is shut to them now ?
1	what god , what ruthless power of mine drove him to ruin ?
1	fine wheels with fellies of solid , deathless gold and round them running rims of bronze clamped fast — a marvel to behold !
1	the ship-race over , good aeneas strides to the grassy level field ringed by hills with woodland sloping down to a vale that formed an enormous round arena
1	even the gods , i say , with incense , soothing vows , with full cups poured and the deep smoky savor men can bring them round , begging for pardon when one oversteps the mark , does something wrong
1	just in the midst of these , these outcries , look , a winging arrow whizzes in and it hits aeneas
1	first came the boeotian units led by leitus and peneleos : arcesilaus and prothoenor and clonius shared command of the armed men who lived in hyria , rocky aulis , schoenus , scolus and eteonus spurred with hills , thespia and graea , the dancing rings of mycalessus , men who lived round harma , ilesion and erythrae and those who settled eleon , hyle and peteon , ocalea , medeon 's fortress walled and strong , copae , eutresis and thisbe thronged with doves , fighters from coronea , haliartus deep in meadows , and the men who held plataea and lived in glisas , men who held the rough-hewn gates of lower thebes , onchestus the holy , poseidon 's sun-filled grove , men from the town of arne green with vineyards , midea and sacred nisa , anthedon-on-the-marches
1	and deiphobus taking aim with his big glinting spear , forever hating the man and he hurled and missed again — but deiphobus hit ascalaphus with that shaft , ascalaphus son of the butcher god of battles — the heavy spearshaft ran him through the shoulder and down he thundered , scraping , clutching the dust
1	surging up from the sea he came to join their ranks , took a seat in their midst and probed zeus 's plans : why now , great king of the lightning , why summon the gods to council once again ?
1	that was your aged father 's parting advice
1	not to be tossed aside , the gifts of the gods , those glories
1	none i know of
1	first he cinched him round with the boxer 's belt then taking rawhide thongs , cut from a field-ox , wrapped his knuckles well
1	the string sang out , arrow shot away razor-sharp and raging to whip through argive ranks !
1	for they had many dead , and some they bury in earth , some they lift and bear off to the nearby fields and the other dead they carry back to town
1	a whirl of his spear and turnus sends asbytes to join him , chloreus too and sybaris , dares , thersilochus , then thymoetes , pitched down over the neck of his bucking horse
1	bantering so , but he flattered swift achilles and the matchless runner paid him back in kind : antilochus , how can i let your praise go unrewarded ?
1	none among all the armies
1	here the auruncans and rutulians sow their crops , plow the rugged hills and graze the wildest banks
1	you sit here , keep drinking the shining wine now , till well-kempt hecamede draws you a warm bath , steaming hot , and washes away that clotted blood
1	i am agony — mother of grief and greatness — o my child !
1	better , no , to settle down on their country ’ s dying ashes , the ground where troy once stood ?
1	dione the light and loveliest of immortals tried to calm her : patience , oh my child
1	three brave sons were born of the loins of portheus : they made their homes in pleuron and craggy calydon , agrius first , then melas , the horseman oeneus third , my father 's father , the bravest of them all
1	but cacus , desperate bandit , wild to leave no crime , no treachery undared , untested , stole from their steadings four champion bulls and as many head of first-rate , well-built heifers
1	devout aeneas offers her up to you , queen juno on high , a blood sacrifice to you , standing her at your altar with her young
1	such maddened words he hurls but no words come from aeneas now— he hurls his spear in reply against his foe and then as lucagus , bending into the stroke , slaps the team with his flat sword , his left foot thrust out , braced for attack , aeneas ’ weapon pierces the bottom plies of his gleaming buckler , ripping into his left groin
1	he 's gone and snatched a corpse from under our noses , single-handed he 's taken down your trusted comrade brave in the front ranks , podes , eetion 's son
1	and many pale-white oxen sank on the iron knife , gasping in slaughter , many sheep and bleating goats and droves of swine with their long glinting tusks , succulent , rich with fat
1	he was enraged by the curses of his mother , volleys of curses she called down from the gods
1	when up rushed agamemnon , blocking his way and shouting out , so soft , dear brother , why ?
1	that girl the sons of achaea picked out for his prize — right from his grasp the mighty agamemnon tore her , and grief for her has been gnawing at his heart
1	darkness , everywhere , closing in around me
1	i know it well myself
1	flinging his slander , ranting taunts—ascanius had enough
1	why , to witness your luckless brother ’ s painful death ?
1	keep your armor that gave you so much joy
1	i was rustling their cattle in reprisal , you see , and he defending his herds , when a spear i hurled caught him right in the front ranks of herdsmen — down he went and round him his yokel drovers scattered home in panic
1	so when they make their roaring swoop along the bay , misenus , poised on a lookout , sounds the alarm , a brazen trumpet blast , and the men attack , geared for a strange new form of combat , fighting to hack these vile seabirds down with bloody swords
1	wars , horrendous wars , and the tiber foaming with tides of blood , i see it all !
1	haven ’ t they seen troy ’ s ramparts , built by neptune ’ s hands , collapse in flames ?
1	but you have got the slowest nags — a handicap , i would say
1	and so we make our way along the pitch-dark paths , and i who had never flinched at the hurtling spears or swarming greek assaults— now every stir of wind , every whisper of sound alarms me , anxious both for the child beside me and burden on my back
1	let him outfight the great achilles , strap on armor the match for his , forged by vulcan ’ s hands
1	best of the lot , the beauties we hand you first , whenever we take some stronghold
1	camilla ’ s finest hour now as dawn rose up and left her ocean bed , aeneas , moved as he is by grief to pause and bury comrades , desolate with their deaths , still the victor pays his vows to the gods as first light breaks
1	armed to the hilt they work the earth , their constant joy to haul fresh booty home and live off all they seize
1	wasn ’ t it he who exposed your wretched trojans to the greeks ?
1	how on earth can we hang back from combat now ?
1	they were the bravest champions born in corinth , in lycia far and wide
1	shrouding herself in her glinting silver robes she went along , in silence
1	let 's try again — this time he will taste my spearpoint
1	the realms of your father , daunus , are yours to manage , so are the many towns your right arm took by force
1	cocles dared to rip the bridge down , cloelia burst her chains and swam the flood
1	antilochus marked him now , great nestor 's son went racing across the front himself , terrified for the lord of armies — what if he were killed ?
1	so men before your time stormed walls and cities , holding fast to that tactic , warring on with heart
1	flee headlong while you can !
1	they hung on his words , complied , rushed to prepare the meal , and each man feasted well and no man 's hunger lacked a share of the banquet
1	no letup , no lance spared !
1	but we can spur the rest of them into battle , all who had nursed some private grudge before , kept to the rear and shunned the grueling forays
1	once you have whipped the enemy from the fleet you must come back , patroclus
1	i beg you , give them all safe passage across your waters , let them reach the tiber— if only my prayers are granted , if fate will grant the trojans city walls
1	— to spread and couple , to bed down for yourself apart from all the troops ?
1	i happen to have some sea-nymphs , fourteen beauties , deiopea the finest of all by far
1	weaker i am , but i still might take your life with one hurl of a spear — my weapon can cut too , long before now its point has found its mark !
1	look at each of you , sitting there , lifeless , lust for glory gone
1	in that spirit , with all his might he hurled a huge spear straight into the monster ’ s flanks , the mortised timberwork of its swollen belly
1	don ’ t let my honor , my fame be torn from its high place , or the sons of aeneas bring latinus round with their lures of marriage , besieging italian soil
1	now i leave her , unaware of the risk i run , whatever it is , with no parting words because— i swear by the night and your right hand—i can not bear the sight of my mother ’ s tears
1	so does helymus , so does acestes ripe in years , the boy ascanius too , and the other young men take his lead
1	and powerful diomedes bowed to her at once : well i know you , goddess , daughter of storming zeus , and so i will tell you all , gladly
1	down he crashed and the darkness swirled his eyes with antilochus rushing over him like some hound pouncing down on a deer that 's just been wounded — leaping out of its lair a hunter 's speared it , a lethal hit that 's loosed its springy limbs
1	three times i tried to fling my arms around her neck , three times i embraced—nothing
1	first and best the gods will give , and your own sense of worth
1	so ram him straight on with your tough bronze !
1	as he bravely heaves and hauls , the goddess juturna , changing back again to the charioteer metiscus , rushes in and returns her brother ’ s sword to turnus
1	deep in grief while his father , weeping freely , walked beside them now
1	no long way off , i think , there are friendly shores , the coast of your brother eryx , sicily ’ s havens , if i remember rightly and take our bearings back by the stars i marked when we set out
1	then let us collect the bones of menoetius ' son patroclus , pick them out with care — but they can not be mistaken : he lay amidst the pyre , apart from all the others burned at the edge , the ruck of men and horses
1	messapus heads the column , the rear ’ s brought up by the sons of tyrrhus , turnus commands the center : a force like the ganges rising , fed by seven quiet streams or the life-giving nile ebbing back from the plains to settle down at last in its own banks and bed
1	as for aeneas , let the man be tossed on strange new seas , follow the course where fortune leads the way
1	so he decrees and speeds the son of maia down the sky to make the lands and the new stronghold , carthage , open in welcome to the trojans , not let dido , unaware of fate , expel them from her borders
1	your son , whom in the old days at troy
1	helmet flashing , rangy hector hurled a resounding yell : diomedes — once the danaan riders prized you first of men with pride of place , choice meats and brimming cups
1	i had already whipped an arrow into him , caught him square in the right shoulder too , just where the breastplate leaves the armpit bare , and i thought i would sent him down to the house of death but i have still not laid him low
1	years ago i visited phrygia rife with vineyards , saw the phrygian men with their swarming horses there — multitudes — the armies of otreus , mygdon like a god , encamped that time along the sangarius river banks
1	all he did was love his unlucky friend too well !
1	but if some deeper longing for mercy stirs beneath your prayers , some notion the whole thrust of the war can shift and change , you ’ re feeding empty hopes
1	the watchdog buried now in sleep , aeneas seizes the way in , quickly clear of the river ’ s edge , the point of no return
1	athena thrust from their eyes the blinding battle-haze , the darkness sent by the gods , and a hard bright light burst down in both directions , out to the ships and down the lines where fighting drew dead even
1	the attempts to heal enflame the fever more
1	his people hung on his words and all obeyed the king
1	no anger , please , great priestess , begged deiphobus
1	closing against each other , just about in range , the magnificent runner achilles opened up , who on earth are you ?
1	but his turn next — menelaus reared with a bronze lance and a prayer to father zeus : zeus , king , give me revenge , he wronged me first !
1	pity the ones whose sons stand up to me in war !
1	but why do i linger on ?
1	do as you please — but none of the deathless gods will ever praise you
1	he winged athena on with a flight of orders : quickly !
1	achilles the son of lovely sleek-haired thetis — the man 's not even fighting , no , he wallows in all his heartsick fury by the ships !
1	year in , year out , the urn stands ready , the fateful lots are drawn
1	but the swift runner replied , immortal iris — what god has sped you here to tell me this ?
1	but the people were not surrendering , not at all
1	they tell how alpheus , the elean river , forcing his passage undersea by secret channels , now , arethusa , mixes streams at your fountain ’ s mouth with your sicilian waters
1	dardan fighters hand-to-hand — now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
1	there on the burnished shield , io , blazoned in gold , her horns raised , her skin already bristly with hair , already changed to a cow— an awesome emblem—as argus guards the girl and father inachus pours his stream from a chased urn
1	across the alean plain he wandered , all alone , eating his heart out , a fugitive on the run from the beaten tracks of men
1	that daredevil diomedes , he would fight father zeus !
1	the tyrians press on with the work , some aligning the walls , struggling to raise the citadel , trundling stones up slopes ; some picking the building sites and plowing out their boundaries , others drafting laws , electing judges , a senate held in awe
1	soon as the warrior menelaus marked him , paris parading there with his big loping strides , flaunting before the troops , atrides thrilled like a lion lighting on some handsome carcass , lucky to find an antlered stag or wild goat just as hunger strikes — he rips it , bolts it down , even with running dogs and lusty hunters rushing him
1	arcadia ’ s prime he hacks down , hacks down the tuscans and you whose bodies went unscarred by the greeks , you trojans too
1	up in arms as they were to shield themselves , they took his word to heart and round the ships they raised a wall of bronze
1	aeneas , astonished , stirred by the tumult , calls out : tell me , sibyl , what does it mean , this thronging toward the river ?
1	there the old man lay , awaiting shining dawn
1	i follow a sign so clear , whoever you are who calls me into action
1	she was weaving at her loom , deep in the high halls , working flowered braiding into a dark red folding robe
1	so now menelaus drew his sword with silver studs and hoisting the weapon high , brought it crashing down on the helmet ridge but the blade smashed where it struck — jagged shatters flying — it dropped from atrides ' hand and the hero cried out , scanning the blank skies , father zeus — no god 's more deadly than you !
1	anna , you see the hurly-burly all across the beach , the crews swarming from every quarter ?
1	well i know , shift to the left , shift to the right my tough tanned shield
1	the grim star of minerva , she bears witness , so do euboea ’ s crags and caphereus ’ vengeful cliffs
1	— zeus who gathers the breasting clouds replied , that is a journey you can make tomorrow
1	we swept down from olympus , all to join this fight so achilles might not fall at trojan hands today
1	the famous runner achilles rose to his challenge : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician
1	how can i force them back to sea once more , command them to spread their sails to the winds ?
1	next time , trust me , you will pay for your crimes with more than just a scolding
1	daedalus , so the story ’ s told , fleeing the realm of minos , daring to trust himself to the sky on beating wings , floated up to the icy north , the first man to fly , and hovered lightly on cumae ’ s heights at last
1	no one , i say — no one alive less soldierly than you , none in the ranks that came to troy with agamemnon
1	don ’ t abandon your sworn bride !
1	then messapus , just sprinting along with a pair of steel-tipped spears in his left hand , training one on the trojan , lets it fly— right on target
1	eight arrows i have let fly , with long sharp barbs , and all stuck in the flesh of soldiers quick to fight — but i still ca not bring this mad dog hector down !
1	their sons ’ sons will see , wherever the wheeling sun looks down on the ocean , rising or setting , east or west , the whole earth turn beneath their feet , their rule !
1	on they went , those dim travelers under the lonely night , through gloom and the empty halls of death ’ s ghostly realm , like those who walk through woods by a grudging moon ’ s deceptive light when jove has plunged the sky in dark and the black night drains all color from the world
1	since she was dying a death not fated or deserved , no , tormented , before her day , in a blaze of passion— proserpina had yet to pluck a golden lock from her head and commit her life to the styx and the dark world below
1	and now the royal kings fell in with nestor
1	you would be the first to blame a man who railed this way
1	and hector called to his men in a ringing voice , trojans !
1	can ’ t you see the dangers closing around you now ?
1	desert us , leave us now—to whom ?
1	so you are that man 's sons ?
1	down she swoops , hurled to earth by a whirlwind , swift as a darting arrow whipped from a bowstring through the clouds , a shaft armed by a parthian , tipped with deadly poison , shot by a parthian or a cretan archer—well past any cure— hissing on unseen through the rushing dark
1	as her beauty ’ s due , proserpina decreed this bough shall be offered up to her as her own hallowed gift
1	as massive as athos , massive as eryx or even father apennine himself , roaring out with his glistening oaks , elated to raise his snow-capped brow to the winds
1	there he is in the bedroom , the bed with inlaid rings — he 's glistening in all his beauty and his robes !
1	so come , follow my orders
1	if only i were as sure of immortality , ageless all my days — and i were prized as they prize athena and apollo — as surely as this day will bring the argives death !
1	yet he ’ s losing touch with himself , racing , hoisting that massive rock in his hands and hurling , true , but his knees buckle , blood ’ s like ice in his veins and the rock he flings through the air , plummeting under its own weight , can not cover the space between them , can not strike full force
1	persuade him , somehow , to help the trojan cause , to pin the achaeans back against their ships , trap them round the bay and mow them down
1	even tremendous hades had to endure that flying shaft like all the rest , when the same man , the son of thunder-shielded zeus , shot him in pylos — there with the troops of battle dead — and surrendered death to pain
1	it 's madness to drive our teams across that trench , impossible to traverse it
1	and you , the rest of you argives , listen closely : every man of you here , mark each word i say
1	and a thick cloud of dust rose up from the man they dragged , his dark hair swirling round that head so handsome once , all tumbled low in the dust — since zeus had given him over to his enemies now to be defiled in the land of his own fathers
1	he raised you when you were little , a bastard boy , no matter — telamon tended you in his own house
1	by the will of zeus , i suppose , and other deathless gods
1	strophades—greek name for the turning islands— lie in the great ionian sea
1	so now , now we will see if achilles kills us both and hauls our bloody armor back to the beaked ships or he goes down in pain beneath your spear
1	against their will the two men made their way along the breaking surf of the barren salt sea and reached the myrmidon shelters and their ships
1	but he holds firm , unafraid , awaiting his great-hearted foe , stands firm in all his mass
1	a tremor ran through all the myrmidon ranks — none dared to look straight at the glare , each fighter shrank away
1	and now , again , the fight for patroclus flared , stretched to the breaking point , mounting in tears , in fury , since pallas fired their blood , sweeping down from the heavens , sent by the father thundering far and wide to drive the argives on , for now his mind had changed , at least for a moment
1	over the earth all weary living things , all birds and flocks were fast asleep when captain aeneas , his heart racked by the threat of war , lay down on a bank beneath the chilly arc of the sky and at long last indulged his limbs in sleep
1	or was it all a dream ?
1	here grim celaeno and sister harpies settled after phineus ’ doors were locked against them all and they fled in fear from the tables where they ’ d gorged
1	and then i put the brain of thundering zeus to sleep , pouring myself in a soft , soothing slumber round him
1	you ’ ll tell the ghost of priam you found an achilles—even here !
1	we offer up full bowls , foaming with warm milk , and our cups of hallowed blood
1	soon as he finds his breath the prince breaks out : the anguish you bear for my sake , generous king , for my sake , i beg you , wipe it from your mind
1	when we shook the lots i drew the sea , my foaming eternal home , and hades drew the land of the dead engulfed in haze and night and zeus drew the heavens , the clouds and the high clear sky , but the earth and olympus heights are common to us all
1	he strode from the rampart , took his stand at the trench but he would not mix with the milling argive ranks
1	three times the brilliant runner achilles charged him , lunged with his bronze spear , three times he slashed at cloud — then at achilles ' fourth assault like something superhuman his terrifying voice burst out in winging words : now , again , you have escaped your death , you dog , but a good close brush with death it was , i would say !
1	no more thoughts of retreat paraded before our people
1	but if such terror grips our hearts and minds , let us beg a favor of our fine prince
1	so by the beaked ships the argives formed for battle , arming round you , achilles — achilles starved for war — and faced by the trojan ranks along the plain 's high ground
1	and such good sense — your parents must be blissful as the gods !
1	pelasgian lethus ' son , lashing a shield-strap round the ankle tendons , was hauling patroclus footfirst through the melee , hoping to please prince hector and all the trojans , hippothous rushing on but death came just as fast
1	what brings you to our house ?
1	so , it ’ s wrong for italians to ring your newborn troy with fire ?
1	diomedes shuddered to see him coming on , the lord of the war cry called out to odysseus quickly , close beside him , we are in for shipwreck — a breaker rolling down on us , look , this massive hector !
1	but soon as he heard the trojans storm the wall and shouts rise from achaeans lost in panic rout , patroclus gave a groan and slapping his thighs hard with the flats of both hands , burst forth in anguish : i ca not stay here with you any longer , eurypylus , much as you need me — there , a great battle breaks !
1	we have fighting men by the hundreds still inside her , forming a wall before our loving parents , wives and sons to defend troy — where you rush on to meet your doom , headlong man as you are , breakneck man of war !
1	hurl your fire now — a blazing inferno of fire against their ships !
1	all hope gone that murderous hector 's rage and invincible spear-arm can be stopped — not now — he will hurl himself against our blackened hulls !
1	now the victory is yours
1	why this deep debate ?
1	for you the grove of angitia wept , for you the crystal swells of fucinus lake , for you the clear quiet pools
1	but the day will come when father , well i know , calls me his darling gray-eyed girl again
1	why , he ’ d even bind together dead bodies and living men , couple them tightly , hand to hand and mouth to mouth— what torture—so in that poison , oozing putrid slime they ’ d die by inches , locked in their brute embrace
1	and we ourselves are mowed down in droves ?
1	not for his son who breathed his last in battle
1	they streamed out at the gates to meet priam bringing in the body of the dead
1	tell me , muse , how it all began
1	the men themselves dried off their sweat-soaked shirts , standing against the wind that whipped along the surf , then entered the tent and took their seats on settles
1	he 's not inviting them to a dance , believe me — he commands them into battle !
1	with that achilles pulled his bronze spear from the river bluff and left him there , the trojan 's life slashed out , sprawled in the sand , drenched by the black tide — eels and fish the corpse 's frenzied attendants ripping into him , nibbling kidney-fat away
1	and still the rest fought on , relentless war cries rising
1	with that , he gave patroclus a sharp glance , a quiet nod to pile the bedding deep for phoenix now , a sign to the rest to think of leaving quickly
1	such disasters were in the stars , from that day on that i like a maniac attacked an immortal ’ s body , my sword defiled the hand of venus with a wound !
1	the king cried out and clambered down to ground from the high tower , issuing quick commands to veteran gateway guards beside the walls : spread the great gates wide — all hands now — till our routed troops can straggle back to troy !
1	you and your anger — rage away !
1	over his right shoulder , down his flank he straps an arcadian sword , swirling back the skin of a panther to drape his left side
1	nor would it be the first time i have had to face the matchless , headlong runner
1	now we must win high honor for peleus ' royal son , far the greatest fighter among the argive fleet , and we who fight beside him the bravest troops — so even mighty atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace achilles , the best of the achaeans !
1	with a dark glance the shrewd tactician odysseus wheeled on his commander : what 's this , atrides , this talk that slips from your clenched teeth ?
1	fronting the temple doors , i bolt the brazen shield great abas bore , and i engrave the offering with a verse : then i command the crews to embark from harbor , man the thwarts
1	flying up to the swirling clouds the arrow shot into flames , blazing its way in fire , burning out into thin air , lost like the shooting stars that often break loose , trailing a mane of flames to sweep across the sky
1	but with hera , though , he is not so outraged , so irate — it 's always your way to thwart his will , whatever zeus commands
1	bandy-legged he was , with one foot clubbed , both shoulders humped together , curving over his caved-in chest , and bobbing above them his skull warped to a point , sprouting clumps of scraggly , woolly hair
1	but the son of cronus throned on high knows nothing , nor does any other immortal housed on olympus shrouded deep in snow
1	he begged them all , groveling in the filth , crying out to them , calling each man by name , let go , my friends !
1	in this cup the woman skilled as a goddess mixed them a strong drink with pramnian wine , over it shredded goat cheese with a bronze grater and scattered barley into it , glistening pure white , then invited them to drink when she had mulled it all
1	nevertheless , i will still troop with the horsemen , give them maneuvers , discipline and commands : that is the right and pride of us old men
1	struck by the sudden sight , aeneas , all unknowing , wonders aloud , and asks : what is the river over there ?
1	you have paid your debt to our king and native land
1	hearing the king 's command the ranks pulled closer , tight as a mason packs a good stone wall , blocks on granite blocks for a storied house that fights the ripping winds — crammed so close the crested helmets , the war-shields bulging , jutting , buckler-to-buckler , helm-to-helm , man-to-man massed tight and the horsehair crests on glittering helmet horns brushed as they tossed their heads , the battalions bulked so dense
1	that city , my people , there ’ s the core and crux of this accursed war
1	here with a swoop the lovely goddess first took up her post , from the high ground looking round for arruns
1	running for dear life , legs driving , never a look behind
1	whom did i have to fear ?
1	others , look , he glimpses left and right in the meadows , feasting , singing in joy a chorus raised to healing apollo , deep in a redolent laurel grove where eridanus river rushes up , in full spate , and rolls through woods in the high world above
1	the old driver will slaughter you on the spot with a sharp bronze blade if you slack off now and we take a lesser prize
1	with all the power in me i have never quit , not from the time we rolled them back to troy
1	once they had reached the high seas , no land in sight , no longer—water at all points , at all points the sky— looming over their heads a pitch-dark thunderhead brought on night and storm , ruffling the swells black
1	he fired them so the armies roared and the ships resounded round them , shattering echoes ringing from their shouts as argives cried assent to king odysseus ' words
1	but then the trojans pinned the achaeans tight against their sterns , they gave them no way out , and the argive warlords begged my son to help , they named in full the troves of glittering gifts they would send his way
1	that very instant storming zeus dispatched apollo : go , my friend , to the side of hector armed in bronze
1	both gods knotted the rope of strife and leveling war , strangling both sides at once by stretching the mighty cable , never broken , never slipped , that snapped the knees of thousands
1	on a crest of olympus under golden clouds he sat , the god of war held fast by the will of zeus , aloof where the other deathless gods were kept back from battle
1	with that she loosed from her breasts the breastband , pierced and alluring , with every kind of enchantment woven through it
1	but now , while they debated their heated , divisive issues , sparring back and forth , aeneas struck camp and deployed his lines for battle
1	the armies looked on wonder-struck and marveled
1	that fool — he rewarded all his kindness with abuse , never gave him the mares he would come so far to win
1	it stood at the gates , huge , blunt at the base but spiked to a jagged point and no two men , the best in the whole realm , could easily prize it up from earth and onto a wagon , weak as men are now — but he quickly raised and shook it as zeus the son of cronus with cronus ' twisting ways made it a light lift for hector all on his own
1	pile it high with his arms— he left them hanging within our bridal chamber— the traitor , so devoted then !
1	while turnus fills his rutulian troops with headlong daring , allecto flies to the trojan camp on stygian wings— a fresh plot in the air—to scout out the place where handsome iulus was hunting along the shore , coursing , netting game
1	you know how my team outstrips all others ' speed
1	vesta and silver-haired good faith and romulus flanked by brother remus will make the laws
1	come , wheel round — stand firm !
1	zeus who marshals the storm cloud loves you both
1	the plan i still retain , and i have been forming , well , for a good long while now , from the very day that you , my illustrious king , infuriated achilles — you went and took from his tents the girl briseis , and not with any applause from us , far from it : i for one , i urged you against it , strenuously
1	you have it all , whatever your heart desires— dido ’ s ablaze with love , drawing the frenzy deep into her bones
1	as ares whipped the fighting spirit in each man sarpedon taunted hector : hector , where has it gone — that high courage you always carried in your heart ?
1	with that , just as dolon reached up for his chin to cling with a frantic hand and beg for life , diomedes struck him square across the neck — a flashing hack of the sword — both tendons snapped and the shrieking head went tumbling in the dust
1	but the two men kept their lookout , always alert to their comrades ' deaths or signs of instant flight as the two fought out on the flank — just as nestor ordered , sending both sons forth from the black ships to battle
1	then , at the same time , i am winging iris down to greathearted priam , commanding the king to ransom his dear son , to go to achaea 's ships , bearing gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
1	no homes , no city walls would give them shelter , nor would he have consented , fierce man that he was , no , a shepherd ’ s life on the lonely mountains , that ’ s the life he led
1	next those who held lacedaemon 's hollows deep with gorges , pharis , sparta and messe , crowded haunt of the wild doves , men who lived in brysiae and augeae 's gracious country , men who held amyclae , helos the seaboard fortress , men who settled laas and lived near oetylus : agamemnon 's brother , menelaus lord of the war cry led their sixty ships , armed them apart , downshore , and amidst their ranks he marched , ablaze with valor , priming men for attack
1	scylla lurks in her blind cave , thrusting out her mouths and hauling ships on her rocks
1	the king of lofty olympus countered briefly : if what you want is reprieve from instant death , some breathing space for the doomed young man , and you acknowledge the limits i lay down , then whisk your turnus away , pluck him out of the closing grip of fate
1	discipline fill your hearts !
1	may this day be one of joy for tyrians here and exiles come from troy , a day our sons will long remember
1	not i — i would not get too close to the son of cronus , much less put him under , not unless the father gave the command himself
1	but far fewer of them went down , remembering always to fight in tight formation , friend defending friend from headlong slaughter
1	achilles served the meat
1	two cups i ’ ll give you , struck in silver , ridged with engraving—father took them both when arisba fell—and a pair of tripods , two large bars of gold , and a winebowl full of years , dido of sidon ’ s gift
1	at once each captain shouted out commands to his driver : rein the team by the trench , good battle-order now !
1	if he returns , all griefs are gone !
1	but the glorious god of earthquakes shook in anger : what outrage !
1	you stay here on foot and guard the walls
1	not a man in sight will take that mission on , i fear , and go against our enemies , scout them out alone in the bracing godsent night — it will take a daring man to do the job
1	dardan fighters hand-to-hand , do not yield an inch , not in these bloody straits !
1	at once we will sacrifice twelve heifers in your shrine , yearlings never broken , if only you will pity troy , the trojan wives and all our helpless children !
1	exultant myrmidons took charge of the gifts and bore them off to their royal captain 's moorings
1	it is no disgrace for a king to appease a man when the king himself was first to give offense
1	a sight not lost on volcens , shouting out from the vanguard : soldiers , halt !
1	they will fight again tomorrow , until they win their way to the fixed doom of troy , since that is your only passion — you two goddesses — to plunder troy to rubble
1	then as the sun rolls round the giant arc of the year , icy winter arrives and a northwind roughens up the seas
1	reaching italy , he erected a city for his people , a trojan home called padua—gave them a trojan name , hung up their trojan arms and there , after long wars , he lingers on in serene and settled peace
1	see who takes the victory prize , the palm
1	i will bring it all to pass
1	he once sailed here for laomedon 's blooded horses , with just six ships and smaller crews than yours , true , but he razed the walls of troy , he widowed all her streets
1	nor was praeneste ’ s founder lacking from the ranks : king caeculus born to vulcan among the flocks , all ages still believe , and found on a burning hearth
1	book eighteen : the shield of achilles
1	they won this land for us with their own blood
1	undaunted , tydeus challenged them all to tests of strength and beat them all with ease , in each event , athena urged him on with so much winning force
1	it fell to earth and an argive snatched it up as it rolled at soldiers ' feet — and the night came blinding down deipyrus ' eyes
1	and they burned these on a cleft stick , peeled and dry , spitted the vitals , held them over hephaestus ' flames and once they would charred the thighs and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
1	no more delay , dodging each other down the passageways of battle !
1	double back on the sea-lanes , back to delos now , apollo ’ s oracle !
1	you , her father , have you no pity for your daughter , none for yourself ?
1	nothing — just shake with dread in the face of mighty hector
1	only one will be lost , one you ’ ll seek at sea
1	so apollo approached like butes head to foot—the man ’ s age , his voice , the shade of his skin , white hair , weapons clanging grimly , and counsels iulus now in his full glow of triumph : son of aeneas , stop !
1	aeneas never stoops to leveling men who show their backs or makes for the ones who fight him fairly , toe-to-toe , or the ones who fling their spears at longer range
1	her frightened comrades hurry to brace their falling queen but arruns races off , more frantic than all the rest— his triumph mixed with terror—no longer trusting his spear or daring to meet the young girl ’ s weapons point-blank
1	diomedes plowed on and after him came the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , following in their wake the great and little ajax armed in fury , idomeneus after them and idomeneus ' good aide , meriones , a match for the butcher god of war , eurypylus after them , euaemon 's gallant son , and teucer came up ninth , tensing his reflex bow and lurking under the wall of giant ajax ' shield
1	the madman , trying to match the storm and matchless lightning just by stamping on bronze with prancing horn-hoofed steeds !
1	and zeus in all his wisdom heard that prayer and straightaway the father launched an eagle — truest of zeus 's signs that fly the skies — the dark marauder that mankind calls the black-wing
1	i will take his lead , you will see
1	we have no lack of a handsome feast , i see that , either in agamemnon 's tents , the son of atreus , or here and now , in yours
1	telamonian ajax first , ajax brought down hyrtius , gyrtius ' son , a lord of the ironhearted mysians
1	all hands snap to orders , hiding swords away in the tall grasses , covering shields as well
1	but on he comes , pyrrhus with all his father ’ s force , no bolts , not even the guards can hold him back— under the ram ’ s repeated blows the doors cave in , the doorposts , prised from their sockets , crash flat
1	nothing can hold him back , this hector in all his fury — nothing , i tell you — not till he leaps behind achilles ' long-maned team and kills us both and routs our forward line — or he goes down himself in the first assault
1	once they had burned the bones and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire
1	glaucus did not turn back or shun that call — on they charged , leading the lycians ' main mass
1	but larger than life , the life i ’ d known so well
1	first of the teams she gave you honey-hearted wheat , she even mixed it with wine for you to drink when the spirit moved her — before she would serve me , though i am proud to say i am her loving husband
1	quick , take up the whip and glittering reins !
1	now go and offer yourself to thankless dangers , you , you laughingstock !
1	and he rose up tall and challenged all the argives : atrides — achaeans-at-arms !
1	the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs are about to crush the men of troy
1	or exhausted , sink down to rest ?
1	i say no wealth is worth my life !
1	he offended athena and hera — both goddesses
1	roaming the woods , a quiver slung from her belt , wearing a spotted lynx-skin , or in full cry , hot on the track of some great frothing boar ?
1	yes , the will of the gods , that drives me through the shadows now , these moldering places so forlorn , this deep unfathomed night— their decrees have forced me on
1	the third day rose , driving the night ’ s chill from the sky as the mourners raked the embers , leveling off the ashes mixed with bones , and piled the gravesite high with mounds of earth still warm
1	there is a river , the minyeos emptying into the sea beside arene 's walls , and there we waited for goddess dawn to rise , the pylian horse in lines while squads of infantry came streaming up behind
1	go now , call ajax , idomeneus , quickly , make a run for it down along the ships
1	here i lie , here laid out for death
1	but here 's the best thing yet he 's done for the men — he 's put a stop to this babbling , foulmouthed fool !
1	they still have a way to go out there , those racing teams
1	see it through , this duty you ’ ve undertaken
1	look what a strong support the son of cronus speeds from ida to take your side and shield you — i am phoebus apollo , lord of the golden sword !
1	turnus in all his fury— that ’ s what the ruthless will of jove demands— abandons his hilltop ambush , quits the shaggy grove
1	pirous son of imbrasus winged it hard and true , the thracian chief who had sailed across from aenus
1	suddenly pallas runs rhoeteus through as he races past in his two-horse chariot
1	but they will never go for nothing , the oaths , the blood of the lambs , the unmixed wine we poured , the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted
1	then idomeneus ' good aide meriones came in fourth , trailing the famed atrides by a spear-throw
1	the crowd ’ s abuzz as he hauls himself to his feet , the one man who could trade blows with paris , dares who , by the mound where great hector lies , crushed the champion butes , that gigantic hulk , a braggart who fought as amycus ’ bebrycian kin— he laid him out on the yellow sand to gasp his last
1	let one of the leading captains take command
1	you really believe the enemy ’ s sailed away ?
1	priam takes command , has him freed from the ropes and chains that bind him fast , and hails him warmly : whoever you are , from now on , now you ’ ve lost the greeks , put them out of your mind and you ’ ll be one of us
1	within her single wall she will gird her seven hills , blest in her breed of men : like the berecynthian mother crowned with her turrets , riding her victor ’ s chariot through the phrygian cities , glad in her brood of gods , embracing a hundred grandsons
1	straight through the pelian ash burst , the shield rang out with a screech — but aeneas crouched low , holding the buckler off his chest , terrified as the shaft shot past his back , hurled so hard it plunged deep in the ground , even after it tore up two round plies of the shield that cased his body
1	the rest of the youngsters ride sicilian horses , old acestes ’ gifts , the riders awed by applause the dardans give their fine dressage , delighted to see in their looks their own lost parents ’ faces
1	and now the sunlight would have set upon their tears if achilles had not turned to agamemnon quickly : atrides — you are the first the armies will obey
1	and diomedes lord of the war cry stepped forward , here is your man
1	my mind is torn , i am harried back and forth , the heart inside me pounding through my chest and the sturdy legs beneath me giving way
1	you leave me a widow , lost in the royal halls — and the boy only a baby , the son we bore together , you and i so doomed
1	four he kept for himself , to rear in his own stalls , but the two you see in action he gave aeneas , both of them driving terrors
1	now aeneas , his ranking chiefs and handsome iulus stretch out on the grass below the boughs of a tall tree , then set about their meal , spreading a feast on wheaten cakes— jove himself impelled them—heaping the plates with ceres ’ gifts , her country fruits
1	his knees went limp , a man who would marched from paeonia , good fertile soil where he excelled all fighters , all but asteropaeus — down to the ground he went but battling asteropaeus pitied his comrade 's pain and charged the argives hard , mad to fight it out — no use , too late
1	they are mauling each other now , achaeans struggling to save the corpse from harm , trojans charging to haul it back to windy troy
1	but now venus , her anguish mounting , goes to neptune , pouring out her heart in a flood of lamentation : juno—her lethal rage , her insatiable spirit , neptune , makes me stoop to every kind of prayer
1	or else you would never see me now , alone on a windswept throne enduring right and wrong
1	an uphill battle it is , trading blows with the wives of zeus who rules the clouds
1	the deadly archer — aeneas knew him at once , looking straight in his eyes and the fighter loosed a rousing shout at hector : hector — all you captains of trojans , trojan allies — shame , what shame !
1	cutting and running so — take care that no one spears you in the back !
1	so you knew nothing at all from zeus about my death — and yet how sure you were !
1	every man of you mass with one resolve !
1	unlucky ufens died before he could see my shame and the trojans commandeered his corpse and weapons
1	even we have gods who battle on our side
1	that was never tydeus ' way , shy behind the lines — he would grapple enemies , bolting ahead of comrades
1	here a youngster breaks from the front— and an arrow whizzes in and down he goes , almo , the eldest son of tyrrhus—the point lodges deep in his throat and chokes off the moist path for his voice and his faint life breath with blood
1	and look , you see how handsome and powerful i am ?
1	i must not go and implore him
1	steal away in silence from my shores ?
1	oh , let no graver news arrive and pierce my ears !
1	then atreus ' son agamemnon stood in behalf of all , lifted his arms and prayed in his deep resounding voice , father zeus !
1	no , no , it 's not that we lack the skill in battle , it 's just the brutal lash of zeus that beats us down
1	but zeus saved me then , put force in my heart , spring in my racing knees
1	i will slip right into enemy lines at once — these trojans , camped at our flank
1	but wait — what am i saying ?
1	is this my binding pledge ?
1	the same people attack us both in savage war , rutulians under turnus , and if they drive us out , nothing , they do believe , can stop their forcing all of italy , all lands of the west beneath their yoke , the masters of every seaboard north and south
1	but if you are an immortal come from the blue , i am not the man to fight the gods of heaven
1	her shield of lightning dazzling , swirling around her , headlong on athena swept through the argive armies , driving soldiers harder , lashing the fighting-fury in each achaean 's heart — no stopping them now , mad for war and struggle
1	then on the peak of eryx reaching for the stars , he founds a temple to venus of mount ida , round it a spreading sacred grove , and appoints a priest to tend anchises ’ tomb
1	he fell hushed at last , his tale complete , at rest
1	but next achilles , burning to cut down asteropaeus hurled his ashen shaft — it flew straight as a die but a clean miss — it struck the river 's high bank and half the length of the lance stuck deep in soil
1	no longer would they make good the gifts , those troves of gifts to warm his heart , and even so he beat off that disaster
1	aeneas — dearest to me of all the men alive
1	but answer my questions
1	better that way — it 's tighter , stronger fighting
1	then you would have real delay in ransoming the body
1	about to swim for it , metabus stops short , stayed by love for his child , fear for that dear burden
1	but i will fill your legs and hearts with strength so you can save automedon , bear him from the fighting back to the fleet
1	like helpless birds , terrorized by the war that ruthless invader brings you , devastating your shores by force of arms
1	first he fastens under his feet the golden sandals , winged to sweep him over the waves and earth alike with the rush of gusting winds
1	i don ’ t flinch from a wreck in such a mooring once i ’ ve seized the land !
1	so athena vaunted and white-armed hera smiled but the mighty god of earthquakes challenged phoebus : apollo — why hold back from each other ?
1	a sharp tremor and the massive god of earthquakes left achaea 's lines , into the surf he dove and heroes missed him sorely
1	next odysseus led his cephallenian companies , gallant-hearted fighters , the island men of ithaca , of mount neriton 's leafy ridges shimmering in the wind , and men who lived in crocylia and rugged aegilips , men who held zacynthus and men who dwelled near samos and mainland men who grazed their flocks across the channel
1	it 's too soon to see agamemnon 's purpose clearly
1	the watchword ’ s out for war
1	now down in the ocean sank the fiery light of day , drawing the dark night across the grain-giving earth
1	down the trojans came like a squall of brawling gale-winds blasting down with the father 's thunder , loosed on earth and a superhuman uproar bursts as they pound the heavy seas , the giant breakers seething , battle lines of them roaring , shoulders rearing , exploding foam , waves in the vanguard , waves rolling in from the rear
1	at once they rush to the walls from all parts of the city
1	holding close to the wall , they picked their way until they reached the brave menestheus ' bastion
1	and he puts the winds to sleep , drifting on and on until he has shrouded over the mountains ' looming peaks and the headlands jutting sharp , the lowlands deep in grass and the rich plowed work of farming men , and the drifts fall on the gray salt surf and the harbors and down along the beaches and only breakers beating against the drifts can hold them off but all else on the earth they cover over , snows from the sky when zeus comes storming down — now so thick-and-fast they volleyed rocks from both sides , some at the trojans , some from trojans against the argives , salvos landing , the whole long rampart thundering under blows
1	but rouse this fellow , wo not you ?
1	pity us , god-fearing men !
1	automedon fought as he rode , though grieving for his friend , swooping in with the team like a vulture after geese
1	what are you plotting ?
1	consider it closely , achilles
1	welcome words , and soon as father neptune had soothed the goddess ’ heart , he harnesses up his team with their yoke of gold , slips the frothing bits in their chafing jaws , slacks the reins and the team goes running free , the sea-blue chariot skimming lightly over the crests and the waves fall calm , and under the axle ’ s thunder the sea swell levels off and the stormclouds flee from the wild skies
1	now a tower reared high , a commanding , salient point with rampways climbing up to it
1	i swear by the unappeasable fountainhead of the styx , the one dread oath decreed for the gods on high
1	right behind them the two aeantes held the trojans off as a wooded rocky ridge stretched out across an entire plain holds back a flood , fighting off the killer-tides of the mounting rivers , beating them all back to swamp the lowland flats — none of their pounding waves can make a breakthrough
1	abandon him here in troy to wallow in all his prizes — he will see if the likes of us have propped him up or not
1	i would not give you a splinter for that man !
1	never — others will take my side and do me honor , zeus above all , whose wisdom rules the world
1	so aeneas , with all eyes fixed on him alone , the founder of his people recalled his wanderings now , the fates the gods had sent
1	his brother alcanor runs to brace his falling brother , quick , but the spear ’ s already flown its bloody way , stabbing his dying arm that hangs from his shoulder , dangling loose by the tendons
1	your pleading repels me now
1	but hector kept on driving too — just at the point where he first broke through the gates and wall he charged , he smashed the achaean lines , dense with armed men , there where protesilaus ' and giant ajax ' ships lay hauled up in the breaking , churning surf and the wall to landward dipped low to the ground , the weakest point where the fiercest fighting raged — waves of trojans , trojan horse in assault
1	what god drove you to italy ?
1	seeing it grieving , he begins : long have we lived together , rhaebus , if anything in this mortal world lives long
1	breach the achaean rampart !
1	for they say hippolytus , once his stepmother ’ s craft had laid him low and he ’ d paid the price his father set in blood and his horses went berserk and tore the man apart , back he came , under the world of stars and windy sky , reborn by the healer ’ s potent herbs and diana ’ s love
1	and here it is , when the fathers ’ will is set on all-out war , the consul himself , decked out in romulus ’ garb , his toga girt up in the ceremonial gabine way , will unbar the screeching gates and cry for war
1	but the welcome he gave aeneas costs him dear
1	piercing loud as the trumpet 's battle cry that blasts from murderous raiding armies ringed around some city — so piercing now the cry that broke from aeacides
1	achilles never dreamed patroclus would storm all troy without him , not even with him
1	up and down the decks of the ships he went with his great plunging strides , swinging in hand his enormous polished pike for fights at sea , clamped with clinchers , twenty-two forearms long
1	you too , ufens , nersae ’ s foothills sent you to war with your glowing fame , your brilliant luck in arms and your aequian clans , most rugged men alive , seasoned to rough hunting in thicket groves on their hardscrabble land
1	the great victor , driving those huge bulls down to pasture , herds crowding these riverbanks and glens
1	will they abandon the city heights with this man fallen ?
1	i have no desire to rise from a bed like that and steal back home to your own high halls — think of the shocking scandal there would be !
1	now time wears on , day in , day out , and the breezes lure our sails , a southwind rippling in our canvas
1	but the cretan captain burst back in answer , ajax , champion wrangler in all the ranks !
1	ismarus , you too , your fine hardy fighters watched you dipping your arrowheads in poison , winging wounds at the enemy
1	but hector rebuked him now , shouting out his name : melanippus — how can we take things lying down this way ?
1	next in the march come twin brothers , leaving tibur ’ s walls and people named for their brother ’ s name , tiburtus— catillus and fearless coras , boys from argos
1	i will hold out till the sun goes down — enduring — fasting — despite your appeals
1	his heavy sweating , his hard breathing stopped the moment the will of storming zeus revived him
1	trojan and tuscan allies pouring down from the tiber , sweeping the whole plain !
1	that very moment , vengeful tisiphone , armed with lashes , springs on the guilty , whips them till they quail , with her left hand shaking all her twisting serpents , summoning up her savage sisters , bands of furies
1	he cheated me , did me damage , wrong !
1	backing into his friendly ranks , he cringed from death as one who trips on a snake in a hilltop hollow recoils , suddenly , trembling grips his knees and pallor takes his cheeks and back he shrinks
1	take what i say to heart and stamp it in your minds : this prophecy the almighty father made to phoebus and phoebus made to me , the greatest of the furies , and i reveal to you
1	revere great juno ’ s power first in all your prayers , to juno chant your vows with a full heart and win the mighty goddess over with gifts to match your vows
1	now as the dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth zeus who loves the lightning summoned all the gods to assembly on the topmost peak of ridged olympus
1	hurl the enemy from the borders !
1	so he proposed and down he sat again as calchas rose among them , thestor 's son , the clearest by far of all the seers who scan the flight of birds
1	but just as we were parceling out the plunder and offering victims to the gods around the city , right on the third day they came , the epeans massed in a swarm of men and plunging battle-stallions struck at the border , full force — and square in their midst the two moliones armed to the hilt , and still boys , not quite masters yet in the ways of combat
1	for the third he produced a fine four-measure cauldron never scorched by flames , its sheen as bright as new
1	now is your time to glory to the skies
1	so even in death 's strong house there is something left , a ghost , a phantom — true , but no real breath of life
1	and the old and noble priam answered slowly , if you truly want me to give prince hector burial , full , royal honors , you would show me a great kindness , achilles , if you would do exactly as i say
1	when could we find a breathing space from fasting ?
1	never once did my altar lack its share of victims , winecups tipped and the deep smoky savor
1	he answered her questions , drawing a labored sigh from deep within his chest : goddess , if i ’ d retrace our story to its start , if you had time to hear the saga of our ordeals , before i finished the evening star would close the gates of olympus , put the day to sleep
1	struck , the italians shout out , saluting that great omen , all hands eager to take up arms , and the augur tolumnius urges first : this , this , he cries , is the answer to all my prayers !
1	i can recall , though the years have blurred the tale , that auruncan elders liked to tell how dardanus sprang up in these fields , then wandered east to the towns of phrygian ida , thracian samos , called samothrace these days
1	i never dreamed i ’ d keep my flight a secret
1	we will set all this to rights , someday , if zeus will ever let us raise the winebowl of freedom high in our halls , high to the gods of cloud and sky who live forever — once we drive these argives geared for battle out of troy !
1	not that i blame you , trojans , nor our pacts , our friendship sealed by a handclasp
1	linger on for the feasts and cups at the groaning board— that ’ s your love , your lust— till the seer will bless and proclaim the sacrifice and the rich victim lures you into the deep groves !
1	but apollo ’ s seer broke in and countered charon : there ’ s no such treachery here—just calm down— no threat of force in our weapons
1	we tossed her some beach to plow—on my terms— and then she spurns our offer of marriage , she embraces aeneas as lord and master in her realm
1	his mother , the goddess , she ’ ll be far from his side with her woman ’ s wiles , lurking in stealthy shadows , hiding him in clouds when her hero cuts and runs !
1	over and over the helmet casing his hollow temples rings out shrill , the solid bronze of it splits wide open under the rocks , the plumes are ripped from his head , the boss of his shield caves in to the hammering blows
1	three blustery winter nights the southwind bore me wildly over the endless waters , then at the fourth dawn , swept up on a breaker ’ s crest , i could almost sight it now—italy !
1	book twenty-one : achilles fights the river
1	still he mocked her with wicked lies , with empty hopes
1	armies of allies crowd the mighty city of priam , true , but they speak a thousand different tongues , fighters gathered here from all ends of the realm
1	the husband to whom my father and noble mother gave me , i saw him torn by the sharp bronze before our city , and my three brothers — a single mother bore us : my brothers , how i loved you !
1	anguish for all that armor — sweep it from your mind
1	do — they are your team , they will haul your curving chariot so much better under the driver they know best if we have to beat retreat from diomedes
1	from this gold goblet father anchises tipped the wine at the high altars
1	everywhere round the wall the surging inhuman blaze of war leapt up the rocks — the argives , desperate , had no choice , they struggled now to defend the ships , and the gods were cast down in spirit , all who had urged the argive soldiers on in battle
1	you ’ ve made me see my son ’ s death with my own eyes , defiled a father ’ s sight with a son ’ s lifeblood
1	like him to the life , the racing iris urged , old priam , words , endless words — that is your passion , always , as once in the days of peace
1	my comrade 's death has cut me to the quick
1	yielding is far better
1	if only you—you have the power—would bend your will to a better goal !
1	then with a groan he called his dear friend by name : feel no anger at me , patroclus , if you learn — even there in the house of death — i let his father have prince hector back
1	you wo not last long , i would say — now the glory 's mine !
1	but the sibyl , still not broken in by apollo , storms with a wild fury through her cave
1	zeus has accomplished everything you wanted , just as you raised your hands and prayed that day
1	let him bow down to me !
1	the archer leaning firmly against a pillar raised on the man-made tomb of dardan 's son , ilus an old lord of the realm in ancient days
1	no coward 's work , to save your exhausted friends from headlong death
1	she ceased and the god of fire quenched his grim inhuman blaze and back in its channel ran the river 's glistening tides
1	now fighting men will sicken of battle quickly : the more dead husks the bronze strews on the ground the sparser the harvest then , when zeus almighty tips his scales and the tide of battle turns — the great steward on high who rules our mortal wars
1	do not seize the girl , agamemnon , powerful as you are — leave her , just as the sons of achaea gave her , his prize from the very first
1	then juno in all her power , filled with pity for dido ’ s agonizing death , her labor long and hard , sped iris down from olympus to release her spirit wrestling now in a deathlock with her limbs
1	and the lord of the battle cry could not refuse but dragged his heels like a lion leaving sheepfolds , bone-weary from harrying hounds and field hands
1	but now i will hasten back
1	if such a glorious destiny can not fire his spirit , if he will not shoulder the task for his own fame , does the father of ascanius grudge his son the walls of rome ?
1	here ritual said that kings should receive the scepter , first raise the rods of power
1	but now menelaus rose , his heart smoldering , still holding a stubborn grudge against antilochus
1	and the men who held euboea , abantes breathing fury , chalcis and eretria , histiaea covered with vineyards , cerinthus along the shore and dion 's hilltop streets , the men who held carystus and men who settled styra
1	much as your heart would spur you on to war
1	but then she saw great zeus at rest on the ridge and the craggy heights of ida gushing cold springs and her heart filled with loathing
1	come , stand in front of your team and chariot , grasp the coiling whip that lashed them home , lay your hand on their manes and swear by the mighty god who grips and shakes the earth you never blocked my chariot — not by deliberate foul
1	but even to us , at last , time brought the answer to our prayers : the help , the arrival of a god
1	but there was a crowd of kin and cousins round me , holding me in the house , begging me to stay
1	i took him on and athena gave me glory
1	there once was a cavern here , a vast unplumbed recess untouched by the sun ’ s rays , where a hideous , part-human monster made his home— cacus
1	he led the men who lived in opois , cynus , calliarus , bessa and scarphe , the delightful town of augeae , tarphe and thronion down the boagrius river
1	his tears , his treachery seized the men whom neither tydeus ’ son nor achilles could defeat , nor ten long years of war , nor all the thousand ships
1	but her eyes widening , noble hera answered , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
1	will your warlust always lie in your windy words and your craven , racing feet ?
1	i no longer beg for the long-lost marriage he betrayed , nor would i ask him now to desert his kingdom , no , his lovely passion , latium
1	his are the best horses i ever saw , the biggest , whiter than snow , and speed to match the wind !
1	or plunge in the heavy swells and swim back to the bay and pitch himself at the trojan spears once more ?
1	zeus willing a trojan victory , hector 's victory , lifting the famous runner achilles ' glory higher , but he had no lust to destroy the whole argive force before the walls of troy — all the father wanted was glory for thetis and thetis ' strong-willed son
1	and here i am , no chariot , no team to speed me on
1	and next , catching sight of the trojan ’ s clothes and the bed they knew by heart , delaying a moment for tears , for memory ’ s sake , the queen lay down and spoke her final words : oh , dear relics , dear as long as fate and the gods allowed , receive my spirit and set me free of pain
1	but now , if you are gearing up for war , your mind set , whatever my pains and all my skills can promise , whatever molten electrum and iron can bring to life , whatever the bellows ’ fiery blasts can do—enough !
1	tonight 's the night that rips our ranks to shreds or pulls us through
1	that said , he orders back the food and cups already cleared away , and the king himself conducts his guests to places on the grass
1	so it must please his overweening heart , who knows ?
1	from italy comes no barrier posed against the towns of tyre
1	trusty friends conducted dares back to the ships , dragging his wobbly knees , his head lolling side to side , spitting clots from his mouth , blood mixed with teeth
1	the two powerful sons of cronus , zeus and poseidon , their deathless spirits warring against each other , were building mortal pains for seasoned heroes
1	how long we waited for you , here on laurentine soil and latian fields
1	thrasymedes staunch in combat handed tydeus ' son a two-edged sword — he would left his own at the ship — a shield too , and over his head he set a helmet , bull's-hide , bare of ridge and crest , a skullcap , so it 's called , and made to protect the heads of tough young-blooded fighters
1	apollo has never lied before
1	just look at this reckless diomedes now — athena spurred him on to rave against the gods
1	heart-weary as we are !
1	a man on fire , he seizes a blazing pine-tar torch in his fist and now , watch , his men pitch into the work as turnus urges them on in person and whole battalions equip themselves with smoking brands
1	so he cried and his own bronze helmet flashed as hector veered away from the heavy fighting , running after his men and caught them quickly
1	look at the endless miles that lie between us
1	ah , how often i watched him battling on the lines where men win glory , saw the man with my own eyes !
1	all shipmates snap to commands , glad to do his orders
1	the lord of the war cry nodded , yes , fine , but what orders for me ?
1	each one killed his man
1	idomeneus wrenched his dark shaft from the corpse but as for the dead man 's burnished gear — no use
1	but now i will go and meet that murderer head-on , that hector who destroyed the dearest life i know
1	turnus , finishing up with a stroke between the helmet ’ s base and the breastplate ’ s upper rim , hacked off his head and left his trunk in the sand
1	never bury my bones apart from yours , achilles , let them lie together
1	many things the run of the days and shifting works of fickle time have turned from bad to good
1	stab me through , if you have any decency left , whip all your lances into me , you rutulians , kill me first with steel !
1	the first by far , eumelus lord of men sprang up , admetus ' prized son who excelled in horsemanship and following him tydides , powerful diomedes , yoking the breed of tros he would wrested from aeneas just the other day when apollo saved their master
1	as soon as her fury dies and raving lips fall still , the hero aeneas launches in : no trials , my lady , can loom before me in any new , surprising form
1	but trojans , thrilled at the sound of zeus 's thunder , pitched themselves at the argives still more fiercely , summoning up their fiery lust for battle
1	entellus towers up for a stunning roundhouse right and dares seeing it coming , ducks , quick , he ’ s gone— but the giant ’ s full force poured in the crashing blow lands on empty air and his own weight brings him down , a colossal man , a colossal fall , he slammed the earth , toppled , as often a hollow pine , ripped up by the roots on steep mount ida or erymanthus , topples down to ground
1	by chance he was counting over his own people , all his cherished heirs , their fame and their fates , their values , acts of valor
1	he fell with a crash , armor ringing against his ribs , his locks like the graces ' locks splashed with blood , still braided tight with gold and silver clips , pinched in like a wasp 's waist
1	but they called him the son of borus , perieres ' son who showered the girl with countless bridal gifts , his wedded bride in the sight of all the world
1	as he racked his brains , desperate , deeply torn , he lit on a quick decision
1	they would not gone far and he ran with eager strides as they bore achilles ' famous arms toward troy
1	the roads resounded with joy , revelry , clapping hands , with bands of matrons in every temple , altars in each and the ground before them strewn with slaughtered steers
1	he summons mnestheus , sergestus , staunch serestus , chosen captains , takes his stand on a high rise where the rest of the trojan fighters cluster round , tight ranks that don ’ t throw down their shields and spears as aeneas , rising amidst them , urges from the earthwork : no delay in obeying my orders—jove backs us now !
1	— patroclus , master horseman — not till you have slashed the shirt around his chest and soaked it red in the blood of man-killing hector !
1	rising among them chryses stretched his arms to the sky and prayed in a high resounding voice , hear me , apollo !
1	here , come closer — trying to frighten argives ?
1	but the red-haired menelaus tried to calm him : courage
1	do as you please — but none of the deathless gods will ever praise you
1	if only the storm that drove you drove your king and aeneas were here now !
1	now , by jove ’ s command he lands on rutulian soil , so now i do come , kneeling before the godhead i adore , begging weapons for my aeneas , a mother for her son !
1	i see two men and they are bearing down to fight you !
1	— as his mind swarms with journeys , fresh desires — so quick in her eager flight flew noble hera now and scaling steep olympus went among the gods , the immortal powers thronging zeus 's halls
1	odysseus knew the end had not yet come — no final , fatal wound — and drawing back he hurled his boast at socus : poor man , headlong death is about to overtake you !
1	like dido now , striding triumphant among her people , spurring on the work of their kingdom still to come
1	what plans are they mapping , what maneuvers next ?
1	and now the volscians charge , ranks of them packing under a tortoise-shell of shields , bent on filling the trenches , tearing down stockades
1	priam forbade his people to wail aloud
1	her gray eyes clear , the goddess athena answered , down from the skies i come to check your rage if only you will yield
1	there in the brush and the rough lairs of beasts he nursed his child on raw milk from the dugs of a wild brood-mare , milking its udders into her tender lips
1	if only i ’ d paid in full with my own guilty life , by any death on earth !
1	fierce young girl , who is the first and who the last your spear cuts down ?
1	gear up with the best and biggest shields in camp and encase our heads in helmets , burnished , fire-bright and take in hand the longest javelins we can find — then in for attack !
1	beside them were those condemned to die on a false charge
1	no doom my noble mother revealed to me from zeus , just this terrible pain that wounds me to the quick — when one man attempts to plunder a man his equal , to commandeer a prize , exulting so in his own power
1	then you are happy enough to down the roast meats and cups of honeyed , mellow wine — all you can drink
1	so now i come , i throw myself at your knees , please help me !
1	he would better aim his terrible salvos at his own , all his sons and daughters
1	with that he wrenched his bronze spear from the corpse , laid it aside and ripped the bloody armor off the back
1	and those who held arcadia under cyllene 's peak , near aepytus ' ancient tomb where men fight hand-to-hand , men who lived in pheneos and orchomenos rife with sheep , stratia , rhipe and enispe whipped by the sudden winds , men who settled tegea , mantinea 's inviting country , men who held stymphalus , men who ruled parrhasia — the son of ancaeus led them , powerful agapenor with sixty ships in all , and aboard each vessel crowded full arcadian companies skilled in war
1	and any trojan crashing against the beaked ships , torch ablaze in hand , straining to please hector who urged him on
1	straight through enemy columns i go plowing now — and no trojan , i guarantee , will thrill with pleasure once he meets my spearshaft head-to-head !
1	mother hera — look , these long-haired achaeans must be sprung of your own immortal loins
1	i will go after nestor , wake and rouse him , see if the good man wants to join the guard , that strong contingent , and give them orders
1	as his spirit churned , at last one plan seemed best : he would send a murderous dream to agamemnon
1	at one glance hector raked his brother with insults , stinging taunts : paris , appalling paris !
1	priam , son of laomedon , bound for salamis , out to visit his sister hesione ’ s kingdom , continued on to see arcadia ’ s cold frontiers
1	i won ’ t miss a single rutulian with my spear , just as my spears impaled the greeks at troy !
1	yet first the handsome iulus—beyond his years , filled with a man ’ s courage , a man ’ s concerns as well— gives them many messages to carry to his father
1	but i could stop that wretched couple 's pain if only i brought your head and bloody armor home and laid them in panthous ' arms , in lovely phrontis ' arms !
1	let them rot , the one or two who hatch their plans apart from all the troops — what good can they win from that ?
1	and the trojan ranks , with lightning-bolt mnestheus out in the lead , unleash an immense barrage of spears , and sweat goes rippling over turnus ’ entire body , rivering down , black with filth— can ’ t catch his breath , gasping , weak knees quaking , bone-tired until at last he dives headfirst , plunging into the river , armor and all , and tiber swept him into its yellow tide , catching him as he came , then bore him up in its soothing waves and bathing away the carnage , gave the elated fighter back to friends
1	god of the silver bow who strides the walls of chryse and cilla sacrosanct — lord in power of tenedos !
1	but at this , salius bursts out with howls that ring through the huge arena , round from the front-row elders to the crowd—a foul had robbed him clean of the prize he wanted back
1	nothing can stop them now — that 's their boast — they will hurl themselves against our blackened hulls
1	i left you alive that day i left these shelters , now i come back to find you fallen , captain of armies !
1	who 's that wounded man he 's bringing in from the fighting ?
1	but the veteran fighter lay there fast asleep , the cured hide of a field ox spread beneath him , a lustrous blanket stretched beneath his head
1	an archer 's hit him , a good hand at the bow , some trojan or some lycian — all glory to him , a heavy blow to us
1	not even his own son !
1	but soon this recourse struck his mind as best : he would go and approach the son of neleus first and see if nestor could work out something with him , some foolproof plan that just might ward disaster off the achaean forces
1	but the red-haired captain flared back in anger : father zeus — listen to this indecent , reckless bluster !
1	how can you say i hang back from the fighting when argive units spur the slashing god of war against these trojan horsemen ?
1	but achilles rounded on agamemnon once again , lashing out at him , not relaxing his anger for a moment : staggering drunk , with your dog 's eyes , your fawn 's heart !
1	i will burn their ships , i will slaughter all their men , argive heroes panicked in smoke along their hulls !
1	no captive slave allotted to serve the lust of a conquering hero ’ s bed !
1	now for a spear — we will see if this can kill you !
1	and what if it 's all true and the man 's to blame — lord of the far-flung kingdoms , hero agamemnon — because he spurned the famous runner achilles ?
1	our blood enemies camp hard by
1	do not let them bear patroclus ' body back to their ships without a fight !
1	oh they would leap for joy to hear the two of you battling on this way , you who excel us all , first in achaean councils , first in the ways of war
1	down the goddess swept from olympus ' craggy peaks and dove like a star the son of cronus flings , cronus with all his turning , twisting ways — a sign to men at sea or a massive army marching , blazing on with a stream of sparks showering in its wake
1	never rest your hands from the great leveler war , not till you pack and cram the trojan armies tight in the famous walls of troy — whoever flees your onset
1	and seizing magus ’ helmet tight in his left hand and wrenching back his neck as the man prays on , he digs his sword-blade deep down to the hilt
1	i myself hold out on shore with the beached ships here but i send my comrade forth to war with troops of myrmidons — launch glory along with him , high lord of thunder , zeus !
1	and no one will heap contempt on what i say , not even mighty agamemnon
1	and so he kept on raging , shaming noble hector , but the gods in bliss looked down and pitied priam 's son
1	now i see them straggling , lost , i hear them groaning as they go under
1	what brave young men !
1	he vowed to me long ago , he bowed his head that i should never embark for home till i had brought the walls of ilium crashing down
1	they tore at the towers ' outworks , pulled at battlements , heaving , trying to pry loose with levers the buttress stakes achaeans first drove in the earth to shore the rampart up — they struggled to root these out , hoping to break down the achaean wall itself
1	from clausus spreads through latium both the claudian tribe and clan , once rome had long been shared with sabine people
1	your prophets dwelling round you , zeus , the selli sleeping along the ground with unwashed feet
1	zeus the father who marshals ranks of storm clouds gave commands , leap to it then
1	the crime ’ s all mine , he never dared , could never do it !
1	then a mixed cordon of boys and mothers rings the walls as the long last struggle calls them all to gather
1	even her father , pluto , loathes the monster , even her own infernal sisters loathe her since she shifts into so many forms , their shapes so fierce , the black snakes of her hair that coil so thickly
1	then on the tenth the gods of heaven interred them
1	but zeus drove a swirl of panic deep in their lines and down from the vaulting skies released a shower raining blood , for zeus was bent on hurling down to the house of death a rout of sturdy fighters
1	so arruns , shaken , slinking from sight , content with a bare escape , loses himself in the milling lines of fighters
1	come , with the first light of day , our spirits high , let ’ s explore the land
1	the moment he joins his comrades packed in ambush he prays to wade in carnage , cut-and-thrust at once
1	and the army gave consent
1	what sorrow has touched your heart ?
1	aeneas charging aphareus , son of caletor , slit open his throat just turning toward aeneas ' ripping blade — his head slumped to the side , shield crushing in on him , helmet too , and courage-shattering death engulfed his corpse
1	young gyas blazed in indignation deep to his bones , tears streamed down his cheeks , he flings to the winds all care for self-respect and the safety of his crew and pitches the sluggish menoetes off the stern , headlong into the sea and takes the helm himself
1	no enemy could ever go against him in arms and leave unscathed , whether he fought on foot or rode on horseback , digging spurs in his charger ’ s lathered flanks
1	and terror-struck in the underworld , hades lord of the dead cringed and sprang from his throne and screamed shrill , fearing the god who rocks the ground above his realm , giant poseidon , would burst the earth wide open now and lay bare to mortal men and immortal gods at last the houses of the dead — the dank , moldering horrors that fill the deathless gods themselves with loathing
1	but lausus ’ father was just stanching his wounds in the tiber ’ s waters , leaning his body against a tree trunk , resting now
1	overflowing with pride , glorying over his bull the old champion shouts : son of the goddess , see , you trojans too , what power i had when i was in my prime , and from what a death you rescue dares now !
1	if he kills you now , how can i ever mourn you on your deathbed ?
1	and you , famous maximus , you are the one man whose delaying tactics save our roman state
1	hard , ruthless man
1	but he showered tears of blood that drenched the earth , showers in praise of him , his own dear son , the man patroclus was just about to kill on troy 's fertile soil , far from his fatherland
1	he tells achates to fetch some gifts as well , plucked from the ruins of troy : a gown stiff with figures stitched in gold , and a woven veil with yellow sprays of acanthus round the border
1	so he wavered , waiting there , but achilles was closing on him now like the god of war , the fighter 's helmet flashing , over his right shoulder shaking the pelian ash spear , that terror , and the bronze around his body flared like a raging fire or the rising , blazing sun
1	but now diomedes thrusting over the giant 's massive shield , again and again , threatened to graze his throat — the spearpoint glinting sharp — and such terror for ajax struck his argive friends they cried for them to stop , to divide the prizes , share and share alike !
1	take this path to the queen ’ s gates
1	but look , suddenly , right before his awestruck eyes , a marvel , shining white through the woods with a brood as white , lying stretched out on a grassy bank for all to see— a great sow
1	the night watch too , it must be kept unbroken , so no night raiders can slip inside the walls with our armies camped afield
1	alone before the gates messapus and brave atinas hold our front lines steady , ringed by enemy squadrons packed tight , bristling a jagged crop of naked blades !
1	then some trojan will glory , swaggering , arrogant , leaping down on the grave of famous menelaus : 'let agamemnon wreak his anger so on all his foes !
1	here and there you can sight some sailors bobbing in heavy seas , strewn in the welter now the weapons , men , stray spars and treasures saved from troy
1	and spread the soothing , healing salves across it , the powerful drugs they say you learned from achilles and chiron the most humane of centaurs taught your friend
1	i never engaged in combat on such terms
1	but at last , goaded on by ulysses ’ mounting threats but in fact conniving in their plot , he breaks his silence and dooms me to the altar
1	today the goddess of birth pangs and labor will bring to light a human child , a man-child born of the stock of men who spring from my blood , one who will lord it over all who dwell around him
1	with such anger seething inside her fiery heart the goddess reached aeolia , breeding-ground of storms , their home swarming with raging gusts from the south
1	and there they were , gathered around priam , panthous and thymoetes , lampus and clytius , hicetaon the gray aide of ares , then those two with unfailing good sense , ucalegon and antenor
1	but hera knew it all
1	the whole grove covers it over , dusky valleys enfold it too , closing in around it
1	he swung the bellows aside and off the fires , gathered the tools he would used to weld the cauldrons and packed them all in a sturdy silver strongbox
1	no , my trojan guest , we have been saved from dangers , brutal perils , and so we observe these rites , we renew them year by year , and justly so
1	with the last words his feet sped him on
1	now — while the gifts still wait — go out and fight !
1	and nestor the noble charioteer assented gladly : true , when the man leaps in the breach that way no one can blame or disobey him , no achaean , not when he spurs the troops and gives commands
1	they would gone to the games , primed to race for the tripod , but augeas the warlord commandeered them on the spot and sent the driver packing , sick for his team
1	so he wonders , madly tugging the reins back and makes the chariot stop
1	but let this be my warning on your way : since apollo insists on taking my chryseis , i will send her back in my own ships with my crew
1	and i tell you this — take it to heart , i urge you — if you send sarpedon home , living still , beware !
1	the brave son of menoetius answered quickly , impossible
1	i tell you this , and so help me it 's the truth — he will soon pay for his arrogance with his life !
1	so go and call the argive warriors to the muster : renounce your rage at the proud commander agamemnon , then arm for battle quickly , don your fighting power !
1	on those terms he dragged his ruthless dagger across the lambs ' throats and let them fall to the ground , dying , gasping away their life breath , cut short by the sharp bronze
1	but queen hera summoned apollo from the halls and iris too , the messenger of the immortals , and gave them both their winged marching orders : zeus directs you to ida with all good speed !
1	i should have torched their camp and flooded their decks with fire
1	what if one of the men gets wind of your brave plan ?
1	the tragic queen of carthage but the queen—too long she has suffered the pain of love , hour by hour nursing the wound with her lifeblood , consumed by the fire buried in her heart
1	athena had swept away their senses
1	grief for your son will do no good at all
1	but i and our fast stallions will not race today , so strong his fame , the charioteer they have lost , so kind — always washing them down with fresh water , sleeking their long manes with smooth olive oil
1	ah my friend , if you and i could escape this fray and live forever , never a trace of age , immortal , i would never fight on the front lines again or command you to the field where men win fame
1	no gold band for her hair , no long flaring cape , a tiger-skin that covered her head hung down her back
1	i fear the man , i would die of shame to rob him — just think of the trouble i might suffer later
1	by now , early dawn had risen up from the saffron bed of tithonus , scattering fresh light on the world
1	so he launched athena already poised for action
1	but maia ’ s father—to trust what we have heard— is atlas , the same atlas who lifts the starry skies
1	next we run with the winds and leave selinus , city of palms , astern , then pick our way by the shoals and hidden spurs of lilybaeum
1	but about your question — yes , i have the answer
1	that is why no mortal can fight achilles head-to-head : at every foray one of the gods goes with him , beating back his death
1	so the red-haired captain bestrode patroclus now , shielding his corpse with spear and round buckler , burning to kill off any man who met him face-to-face
1	the gods looked grim throughout the halls of zeus
1	his strong fate was driving him now against sarpedon , a man like a god
1	god forbid they panic , skittish with fear , buck and never pull us out of the fighting , missing your own voice as tydeus ' son attacks — he will kill us both and drive them off as prizes
1	there hector struck , hurling the jagged rock at teucer drawing in fury — snapped the string and his hand went numb at the wrist , he dropped to a knee , dazed
1	now is the time for him to work , to hunt the leading captains and beg them all for help
1	she always feels alone , abandoned , always wandering down some endless road , not a friend in sight , seeking her own phoenicians in some godforsaken land
1	so the bronze flared on his chest as on he raced — and the old man moaned , flinging both hands high , beating his head and groaning deep he called , begging his dear son who stood before the gates , unshakable , furious to fight achilles to the death
1	seek out the town of corythus , sail for italy !
1	as soon as the shadows were dispersed and the light restored to his mind , he turned his fiery glance toward the ramparts , glaring back from his chariot to the town
1	and last they yoked his team to the king 's chariot , stallions he bred himself in his own polished stalls
1	the huge guard at the gates can howl for eternity from his cave , terrifying the bloodless shades , persephone keep her chastity safe at home behind her uncle ’ s doors
1	his mind in turmoil , this way seemed the best : he would head for atreus ' son
1	my father adamastus was poor , and so i sailed to troy— oh if only our poverty lasted longer !
1	and hector lunged again like a murderous lion mad for kills , charging cattle grazing across the flats of a broad marshy pasture , flocks by the hundred led by an unskilled herdsman helpless to keep the marauder off a longhorn heifer — no fighting that bloody slaughter — all he can do is keep pace with the lead or straggling heads , leaving the center free for the big cat 's pounce and it eats a heifer raw as the rest stampede away
1	to italy you will go
1	and father vulcan , enthralled by venus , his everlasting love , replied : why plumb the past for appeals ?
1	who are your people ?
1	our fate , i tell you , stands on a razor 's edge : life or death for achaea , gruesome death at that
1	the persuasion of a comrade has its powers
1	so now i meet my doom
1	each received his realm
1	they all roared with laughter at his expense
1	urging them on but torn : whom to lead to the shore assault ?
1	so all the more you can rejoice with me in italy , found at last
1	and the first to beat retreat , a boeotian , peneleos
1	you be more just to others , from now on
1	quickly he trained his reflex bow on diomedes charging straight ahead — he shot !
1	though his rich estates lie far away in the country , it wo not be want of iron that brings his shepherd or plowman into town — he will be well-stocked at home
1	as such fears went churning through his mind the warlord nestor 's son drew near him now , streaming warm tears , to give the dreaded message : ah son of royal peleus , what you must hear from me !
1	it was not trojan spearmen who brought me here to fight
1	how many sons of gods went down under troy ’ s high wall !
1	mixed with ausonian blood , one race will spring from them , and you will see them outstrip all men , outstrip all gods in reverence
1	yes , and here , carved in seasoned cedar , rows of statues , rows of the founding forebears : italus , father sabinus , the vintner ’ s figure still wielding his hooked knife ; old saturn and janus ’ figure facing right and left
1	a chaste sibyl will guide you there , once you have offered the blood of many pure black sheep
1	he could keep his feet no longer , knees caved in on the spot — as under the ruffling north wind a fish goes arching up and flops back down on a beach-break strewn with seaweed and a dark wave blacks him out
1	as the snake devoured the sparrow with her brood , eight and the mother made the ninth , she would borne them all , so we will fight in troy that many years and then , then in the tenth we will take her broad streets
1	so home we go in those ships and cut the seas again , since now such deadly anger strikes our captain
1	that promise lifts his anguish , drives , for a while , the grief from his sad heart
1	and there in the midst of milling thousands , chiefs paraded left and right , resplendent in all their purple-and-gold regalia : mnestheus , blood kin of assaracus , hardy asilas , then messapus , breaker of horses , neptune ’ s son
1	then ocean men from dulichion and the holy islands , the echinades rising over the sea across from elis — meges a match for ares led their troops to war , a son of the rider phyleus dear to zeus who once , enraged at his father , fled and settled dulichion
1	and father zeus will waste me with a hideous fate , and after i have lived to look on so much horror !
1	you are not to blame
1	ajax ' challenge — how could it please his courage still to hang back now where other achaeans held the rear ?
1	all on my own i ’ ll bring your temple yearly gifts !
1	hector — his loving wife and noble mother were first to fling themselves on the wagon rolling on , the first to tear their hair , embrace his head and a wailing throng of people milled around them
1	shaking fists , they shout to arms !
1	but the will of zeus will always overpower the will of men , zeus who strikes fear in even the bravest man of war and tears away his triumph , all in a lightning flash , and at other times he will spur a man to battle , just as he urged patroclus ' fury now
1	how long we ’ ve waited , hector , for you to come , and now from what far shores ?
1	laocoön deserved to pay for his outrage , so they say , he desecrated the sacred timbers of the horse , he hurled his wicked lance at the beast ’ s back
1	on the other flank , agrippa stands tall as he steers his ships in line , impelled by favoring winds and gods and from his forehead glitter the beaks of ships on the naval crown , proud ensign earned in war
1	but hermes the guide of souls and giant-killer reassured her mother , leto , nothing to fear , i would never fight you , leto
1	elephenor , comrade of ares , led the whole contingent , chalcodon 's son , a lord of the fierce abantes
1	his gifts , i loathe his gifts
1	once i have washed my sweat away in the river , yes , i just might make it back again to troy — but why debate , my friend , why thrash things out ?
1	juno had barely closed when tears brimmed in juturna ’ s eyes and three , four times over she beat her lovely breast
1	already a new achilles springs to life in latium , son of a goddess too !
1	great ajax now — forever aiming at hector , trying to strike his helmet flashing bronze but hector was far too seasoned , combat-tested , broad shoulders hunching under his bull's-hide shield , his eyes peeled for a whistling shaft or thudding spear
1	but you , my king , be on your guard yourself
1	he commands his men
1	but now , look , just slipped out from under the greek barrage of spears , panthus , othrys ’ son , a priest of apollo ’ s shrine on the citadel—hands full of the holy things , the images of our conquered gods—he ’ s dragging along his little grandson , making a wild dash for our doors
1	you will never set your eyes on the day of doom that topples looming troy
1	and he enters the great shaded river , overjoyed
1	trail the trojan ships , bend to the trojans ’ every last demand ?
1	his scraggly beard a tangled mat of white , his eyes fixed in a fiery stare , and his grimy rags hang down from his shoulders by a knot
1	then , with the first lull in the feast , the tables cleared away , they set out massive bowls and crown the wine with wreaths
1	you tell me to put my trust in birds , flying off on their long wild wings ?
1	his fine voice rising and falling low as the rest followed , all together , frisking , singing , shouting , their dancing footsteps beating out the time
1	oh no , you wo not get past me , take me in that way !
1	the heart inside you is always tempered hard , like an ax that goes through wood when a shipwright cuts out ship timbers with every ounce of skill and the blade 's weight drives the man 's stroke
1	we worship you first and foremost , honor your fires stoked by cords of pine !
1	fortune speeds the bold !
1	and then , when the first deep rest had driven sleep away and the chariot of night had wheeled past mid-career , that hour a housewife rises , faced with scratching out a living with loom and minerva ’ s homespun crafts , and rakes the ashes first to awake the sleeping fires , adding night to her working hours , and sets her women toiling on at the long day ’ s chores by torchlight— and all to keep the bed of her husband chaste and rear her little boys—so early , briskly , in such good time the fire-god rises up from his downy bed to labor at his forge
1	hector struggled for words , his helmet flashing : who are you , my lord — who of the high gods — to probe me face-to-face ?
1	but the lord of the war cry aimed for helenus ' hand gripping his polished bow — and clean through his fist the bronze spearhead drove and cracked the tensed weapon
1	call up the joy of war !
1	this sign is yours : troy rests in your power
1	what good will it do him ?
1	and deep in his well-built lodge achilles slept with the woman he brought from lesbos , phorbas ' daughter , diomede in all her beauty sleeping by his side
1	armies gathering now as the huge flocks on flocks of winging birds , geese or cranes or swans with their long lancing necks — circling asian marshes round the cayster outflow , wheeling in all directions , glorying in their wings — keep on landing , advancing , wave on shrieking wave and the tidal flats resound
1	a brisk command , and the runner snapped to it — he dashed along the wall of the argive men-at-arms till he reached the two aeantes , stopped and shouted , ajax — ajax !
1	deeply shaken , i pray to the country nymphs and father mars who strides the fields of thrace : make this sight a blessing , lift the omen ’ s weight !
1	now the sea was going red with the rays of dawn , from the heavens gold aurora shone in her rose-red car when the wind died down , suddenly every breeze fell flat and the oars struggle against a sluggish , leaden swell
1	but not his body : i will hand it back to the decked ships , so the long-haired achaeans can give him full rites and heap his barrow high by the broad hellespont
1	and how much better it would have been !
1	and now this second paris
1	at that the king of men agamemnon backed down : a painful charge , odysseus , straight to the heart
1	no fear in your hearts for the quaking rage of zeus , the thundering god of host and welcome stranger — one day he will raze your lofty city for you
1	they ’ re closing in , i can see their glinting shields , their flashing bronze !
1	and even mothers up on the ramparts strive— their genuine love of country marks the way , they ’ d seen camilla fight—they hurl their weapons with trembling hands , daring to do the work of iron with pikes of rugged oak and poles charred hard
1	fathers , founders of our people
1	to disrupt the tuscans ’ faith , inflame a peaceful people ?
1	have you no fear of the argives breathing hate and fury ?
1	you too , unlucky cydon , pursuing clytius , your new love , his cheeks soft with the first gold down of youth— you would have gone down under the trojan ’ s hand and died a pitiful death , with all recall of your young boy lovers lost , if a pack of your brothers had not blocked aeneas , seven of phorcus ’ offspring rifling seven spears , some glancing off his shield and his helmet , harmless , others , that loving venus flicked away , just scratched his body
1	zeus also gave me a son to bear and breed , the splendor of heroes , and he shot up like a young branch , like a fine tree i reared him — the orchard 's crowning glory — but only to send him off in the beaked ships to troy to battle trojans !
1	much as you care for me , let me hurry out of the city , make my way , all on my own , to achaea 's waiting ships !
1	facing ares ' power and hector helmed in bronze , they neither turned and ran for their black ships nor traded blows with enemies man-to-man
1	and idomeneus over there — standing with his cretans — like a god , you see ?
1	tell me what 's on your mind
1	so into the bloody , buckling lines rides tarchon , goading his horsemen on with a burst of mixed cries , rallying each by name , spurring the routed back to battle : what ’ s your fear , you tuscans forever deaf to shame ?
1	so they will mutter
1	but now their commander , swift achilles was led away by achaea 's kings , barely able to bring him round — still raging for his friend — to feast with agamemnon
1	so she does as she is told
1	come , while there 's still time , think hard : how can you fight off the argives ' fatal day ?
1	but father rages now , that hard black heart , always the old outrage , dashing all my plans !
1	think , should keels laid by a mortal hand enjoy an immortal ’ s rights ?
1	what good will a man , even one in the next generation , get from you unless you defend the argives from disaster ?
1	and how they thrilled to see him still alive , safe , unharmed and marching back to their lines , his soul ablaze for war , but his men asked him nothing
1	what am i saying ?
1	so , bluster away with your bombast—that ’ s your style !
1	what is this flight that takes me home ? —a coward ! — will i ever see my laurentine walls and camp again ?
1	we do have prayers , you know , prayers for forgiveness , daughters of mighty zeus
1	you and your bluster — you are talking nonsense !
1	raked by the scathing taunt camilla blazes up in rage , hands off her horse to an aide and takes her stand against the ligurian : fearless on foot and armed like him with a naked sword and still unbattered shield
1	now fire up the rest of your long-haired achaeans
1	and iris racing the wind went veering past and hera turned to pallas , calling off the conflict : enough
1	your favorite man of war
1	and far on the other side achaean troops came streaming out of the well-benched ships , some to gather the bodies , some the timber
1	and he called the two aeantes and menelaus : ajax , ajax — lords of the argives — menelaus !
1	show respect for your own house
1	cronus ' son has entangled me in madness , blinding ruin — zeus is a harsh , cruel god
1	yet the spirit inside him never shrinks from claiming to be my equal , never , though other gods will cringe from me in terror
1	menelaus cut him down , was stripping off his armor — menelaus fierce as a mountain lion sure of his power , seizing the choicest head from a good grazing herd
1	but the lord of the silver bow devised a phantom — like aeneas to the life , wearing his very armor — and round that phantom trojans and brave achaeans went at each other , hacking the oxhides round their chests , the bucklers full and round , skin-shields , tassels flying
1	diomedes , odysseus , atreus ' son agamemnon ranged the ranks , made them exchange their armor
1	omens of this she gave in no uncertain terms
1	oh , if only my fears were false and i deceived !
1	pluck your brother from death , if there ’ s a way , or drum up war and abort that treaty they conceived
1	what drives you on ?
1	think what a staunch support sarpedon was to you and to all troy while the man was still alive !
1	all fated wars to come will end in peace , justly , under assaracus ’ future sons— troy can never hold you !
1	phegeus could not face his assault , his deafening cries ; he flung himself before the chariot , right hand wrestling the horses ’ jaws around as they came charging into him , frothing at their bits , then dragged him dangling down from the yoke as turnus ’ spearhead hit his exposed flank and ripping the double links of his breastplate , there it stuck , just grazing the fighter ’ s skin
1	suddenly paris struck him under the jaw and ear — and life flew from his limbs and the hateful darkness had him in its grip
1	and round him phoebus apollo brought a dark cloud down from high sky to the plain to shroud the entire space where hector 's body lay , before the sun 's white fury could sear away his flesh , his limbs and sinews
1	that challenge made , he closes on his enemy , spear poised for the kill as mezentius answers back : why , you king of cruelty , now that you ’ ve killed my son , why try to make me cringe ?
1	as the wind we pray for quickens , a harbor opens wide and closer till we can see minerva ’ s temple on the heights
1	you gods who govern the realm of ghosts , you voiceless shades and chaos— you , the river of fire , you far-flung regions hushed in night— lend me the right to tell what i have heard , lend your power to reveal the world immersed in the misty depths of earth
1	now , by god , i call a halt to all my anger — it 's wrong to keep on raging , heart inflamed forever
1	but the other trojans and argive men-at-arms fought on at their ease beneath a clear blue sky — sharp brilliance of sunlight glittering round them , not a cloud in sight to shadow the earth and mountains
1	here the tiber cuts us off and there the rutulians close the vise , the clang of their armor echoes round our walls
1	no sooner said than before his eyes , twin doves chanced to come flying down the sky and lit on the green grass at his feet
1	still , you carry no mean fame to your fathers ’ shades— just tell them this : you died by camilla ’ s spear !
1	up with you , all you argives geared for combat , stand your ground , right here , until we take the mighty walls of priam !
1	king who devours his people !
1	all that he had was lost , lost when the trojans killed his steadfast friend
1	then old nautes , the one man tritonian pallas taught , making him famous for his knowledge of her arts , giving him answers for what the gods ’ great rage might mean or what the march of fate cried out for— nautes speaks , consoling aeneas with his counsel : son of venus , whether the fates will draw us on or draw us back , let ’ s follow where they lead
1	ares and pallas led them , both burnished gold , gold the attire they donned , and great , magnificent in their armor — gods for all the world , looming up in their brilliance , towering over troops
1	your right hand pledged , time and again , to turnus , your blood kin ?
1	like troops on attack they ’ re heading straight for laocoön— first each serpent seizes one of his small young sons , constricting , twisting around him , sinks its fangs in the tortured limbs , and gorges
1	there our achaeans swung round from buprasion , heading their high-strung horses back to pylos where all gave glory to zeus among the gods and among all men to nestor
1	this time , though , he woke before me , came and roused me first and i sent him off to call the men you are after
1	that burly heart pylaemenes led his paphlagonians out of enetian country , land where the wild mules breed : the men who held cytorus and lived in range of sesamus , building their storied halls along the parthenius river , at cromna , aegialus and the highland fortress erythini
1	dido was married to sychaeus , the richest man in tyre , and she , poor girl , was consumed with love for him
1	they took the old captain 's lead , the argive kings all called to the muster now
1	the shaft pierced the tight belt 's twisted thongs , piercing the blazoned plates , piercing the guard he wore to shield his loins and block the spears , his best defense — the shaft pierced even this , the tip of the weapon grazing the man 's flesh , and dark blood came spurting from the wound
1	the guide and giant-killer reassured him : so far , old man , no birds or dogs have eaten him
1	while fortune seemed to allow and fate to suffer the latian state to thrive , i guarded turnus , guarded your city walls
1	you have acestes , a trojan born of the gods , a ready adviser
1	i would be pleased to hear him
1	he burns with lust for the sword , the cursed madness of war and rage to top it off
1	your sense of justice , your awesome works of war ?
1	all the treasures of troy hauled from the burning shrines—the sacramental tables , bowls of solid gold and the holy robes they ’ d seized from every quarter—greeks , piling high the plunder
1	as they came marching in , he hailed them first with peaceful words of welcome : tell us , sons of dardanus—for we know your city , your stock , and we heard that you were sailing here— what do you search for now ?
1	that is the source of all men ’ s fears and longings , joys and sorrows , nor can they see the heavens ’ light , shut up in the body ’ s tomb , a prison dark and deep
1	fear exposes the lowborn man at once
1	nor did prince aeneas hold back from the omen
1	time and again he asks for news of lausus , again he dispatches runners to recall him , bearing a stricken father ’ s orders
1	but achilles slaughtered on and on , never pausing , killing trojans and skittish battle-teams at once
1	perched on a beetling crag , celaeno , prophet of doom—her shrieks erupted from her breast : so , war as well now ?
1	and deep in his heart brave ajax knew and shuddered — here was work of the gods , thundering zeus on high , cutting him off from battle , dashing all his plans , zeus , determined to grant the trojans triumph now
1	quickly sarpedon swung his shield before him — balanced and handsome beaten bronze a bronzesmith hammered out with layer on layer of hide inside and stitched with golden rivets round the rim
1	a hush fell as venulus , following orders , tells his story : my countrymen , we have seen diomedes , seen the argive camp
1	pallas attacks him , praying first : now , father tiber , grant the spear i ’ m about to hurl a lucky path through rugged halaesus ’ chest— i ’ ll strip him of weapons , hang them on your oak !
1	only euryalus rose to take him on , heroic volunteer , bred of talaus ' blood and a son of king mecisteus who went to thebes in the old days , when oedipus fell , and there at his funeral games defeated all the thebans
1	so celaeno shrieked and taking flight , dashed back to the forest
1	but zeus who marshals the storm clouds warned his queen , now , hera , do not fly into such a rage at fellow gods
1	but one , one was left me , to guard my walls , my people — the one you killed the other day , defending his fatherland , my hector !
1	so he cried from far on the city 's heights , the awesome god apollo
1	and mother , who ruled under the timberline of woody placos once — he no sooner haled her here with his other plunder than he took a priceless ransom , set her free and home she went to her father 's royal halls where artemis , showering arrows , shot her down
1	not with a pair like us to urge you on — gods-in-arms sent down with zeus 's blessings , i and pallas athena
1	and now it encased odysseus ' head , snug around his brows
1	the entire heartland here is thick with woods , cocytus glides around it , coiling dense and dark
1	at once devoted aeneas ripped the robe on his shoulders , called the gods for help and flung his hands in prayer : almighty jove , if you still don ’ t hate all trojans , if you still look down with your old sense of devotion , still respect men ’ s labors , save our fleet from fire !
1	and each soldier scratched his mark on a stone and threw it into atrides agamemnon 's helmet
1	down come captain aeneas and all his fighters picked for battle , water their horses well and weary troops take rest
1	not loitering now , not slinking back tomorrow
1	and the old charioteer warmed to his challenge : great marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon — hector and hector 's high hopes ?
1	she vanished into the dense night
1	a crack of the whip — the goddess hera lashed the team , and all on their own force the gates of heaven thundered open , kept by the seasons , guards of the vaulting sky and olympus heights empowered to spread the massing clouds or close them round once more , and straight through the great gates she drove the team
1	the wolf rages , desperate , how can he maul a quarry out of reach ?
1	god of the wild cry , apollo — so you wrecked the achaeans ' work and drove the men who had built it up with all that grief and labor into headlong panic rout
1	book twenty-two : the death of hector
1	i beg you now by your self-respect , your own brave work , by your chief evander ’ s name , your victories won , by my own rising hopes to match my father ’ s fame , don ’ t trust to your feet—hack the foe with swords , that ’ s the way !
1	deep in the woods on aventine hill the priestess rhea bore him all in secret , into the world of light
1	true , athena held her peace and said nothing
1	it ’ s not for first place now mnestheus strives , not for victory— oh , if only— no , let neptune pick the winner he wants but we must not come last , what shame !
1	listen , this too — take it to heart , i beg you — do not kill me !
1	invite to the feast our household gods , the gods of our own home and those our host acestes worships , too
1	at last the day was breaking , the morning star on the rise , aurora had just burned off the night ’ s dank fog , when suddenly out of the woods the weird shape of a man , a stranger , all but starved to death , in wretched condition , emerges , staggers toward us , hands outstretched to us on the beaches , begging mercy
1	into the flames with councils , all the plans of men , the vows sealed with the strong , unmixed wine , the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted !
1	he 's still bursting with anger , more than ever — he spurns you , spurns all your gifts
1	and the raucous trumpet sounds the signal—bloody war !
1	you who were never wild or reckless in the past
1	well , go to him yourself — you hover beside him !
1	my honors never equal yours , whenever we sack some wealthy trojan stronghold — my arms bear the brunt of the raw , savage fighting , true , but when it comes to dividing up the plunder the lion 's share is yours , and back i go to my ships , clutching some scrap , some pittance that i love , when i have fought to exhaustion
1	what a tale he ’ s told , what a bitter bowl of war he ’ s drunk to the dregs
1	swift as a dove , flushed in fear from a cave where it nests its darling chicks in crannies , a sudden burst of wings and out its home it flies , terrified , off into open fields and next it skims through the bright , quiet air and never beats a wing
1	but even so , late as it is , let us contrive to set all this to rights , to bring him round with gifts of friendship and warm , winning words
1	then earth , the sun , and furies stalking the world below to wreak revenge on the dead who broke their oaths — i swear i never laid a hand on the girl briseis , i never forced her to serve my lust in bed or perform some other task
1	plunging overboard , even in choppy , heaving seas , just as he dives to ground from his war-car now
1	there , there in the clouds and high clear sky you dangled
1	even a fool learns something once it hits him
1	with that the driver clambered through the trench
1	you really want to raid some enemy units ?
1	he woke with a jolt and seeing empty ground where the fast team had stood , men gasping out their lives , retching in all that carnage , he wailed out , sobbing , crying his dear companion 's name and piercing wails broke as the trojans swirled in panic — a desperate rout of them rushing up to the bloodbath there stood staring down at the grisly work the marauders did before they made their dash for the beaked ships
1	but capys with other saner heads who take his side , suspecting a trap in any gift the greeks might offer , tells us : fling it into the sea or torch the thing to ash or bore into the depths of its womb where men can hide !
1	he rose up tall and challenged all the argives : son of atreus — all you achaean men-at-arms !
1	aeneas , opposite , threatens death and doom at once to anyone in his way , he threatens his harried foes that he ’ ll root their city out and , wounded as he is , keeps closing for the kill
1	so she pressed and zeus the father of men and gods complied at once
1	there his brothers and countrymen will bury the prince with full royal rites , with mounded tomb and pillar
1	if there ’ s a path , fly through the air , set me a course to the grove where that rich branch shades the good green earth
1	and with all good will i say , fight it out with the trojans here !
1	no use to you now , they will never shroud your body — but they will be your glory burned by the trojan men and women in your honor !
1	for thetis is always there , his mother always hovering near him night and day
1	spotting him far out on the open meadow , turnus hits him first with a light spear winged across that empty space then races up to him , halts his team , and rearing over the dying trojan , plants a foot on his neck and tears the sword from his grip—a flash of the blade— he stains it red in the man ’ s throat , and to top it off cries out : look here , trojan , here are the fields , the great land of the west you fought to win in war
1	and the kings themselves , overcoming their wounds , arrayed them all in proper battle-order
1	you ’ re roving far too freely , high on the heavens ’ winds , and the father , king of steep olympus , won ’ t allow it
1	even though his courage may blaze up for combat , his limbs will turn to lead before he knows it , thirst and hunger will overtake him quickly , his knees will cave in as the man struggles on
1	he raised me as a child , that man of doom , his daughter just as doomed — would to god he would never fathered me !
1	no doubt the countrymen round about him plague him now , with no one there to defend him , beat away disaster
1	we have reached the limit
1	and now , with all good will , polydamas rose and spoke : weigh both sides of the crisis well , my friends
1	there in the depths of the dark forbidden chamber leto and artemis who showers flights of arrows healed the man and brought him back to glory
1	so , with a deep groan , the king addressed his armies : friends
1	the crier talthybius , his voice clear as a god 's , holding the boar in his arms , flanked the great commander
1	italy is the land you seek ?
1	if only strife could die from the lives of gods and men and anger that drives the sanest man to flare in outrage — bitter gall , sweeter than dripping streams of honey , that swarms in people 's chests and blinds like smoke — just like the anger agamemnon king of men has roused within me now
1	but athena , missing nothing of phoebus ' foul play that robbed diomedes , sped to the gallant captain , handed him back his whip , primed his team with power and flying after admetus ' son in full immortal fury the goddess smashed his yoke
1	with my own eyes i ’ ve seen him snatch a pair of our men in one massive hand and , sprawling amidst his lair , crush their bodies on the rocks till the cave ’ s maw swam with splashing blood
1	so the trojans storm in , their commander heading them toward the foe , their tight ranks packed in a wedge , comrade linked with comrade massing hard
1	it 's not right to batter another deathless god , not for the sake of these mortals
1	and i , i go to his side — nothing i do can help him
1	so , you ca not stand up to the battling menelaus ?
1	aeneas stopped , struck by the sight
1	once the men had prayed and flung the barley , first they lifted back the heads of the victims , slit their throats , skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat , a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh
1	quickly cocking his arm , his lance brandished high , he cranes up at the moon and prays his heart out : you , goddess , latona ’ s daughter !
1	to what extremes won ’ t you compel our hearts , you accursed lust for gold ?
1	caesar himself , throned at brilliant apollo ’ s snow-white gates , reviews the gifts brought on by the nations of the earth and he mounts them high on the lofty temple doors as the vanquished people move in a long slow file , their dress , their arms as motley as their tongues
1	so here the twins were laid low at aeneas ' hands , down they crashed like lofty pine trees axed
1	but i have you with me now
1	no man will hurl me down to death , against my fate
1	antilochus thrust first , speared the horsehair helmet right at the ridge , and the bronze spearpoint lodged in the man 's forehead , smashing through his skull and the dark came whirling down across his eyes — he toppled down like a tower in the rough assault
1	oh would to god — father zeus , athena and lord apollo — not one of all these trojans could flee his death , not one , no argive either , but we could stride from the slaughter so we could bring troy 's hallowed crown of towers toppling down around us — you and i alone !
1	turn them back , do not let them engage me here
1	but where does the build-up end ?
1	our rites complete , at once we swing our sails to the wind on yardarm spars and put astern this home of greeks , the fields we dare not trust
1	we ’ ve hacked a path through enemy lines—enough !
1	rapturous song and the beat and sway of dancing
1	i and my warring kings— a mockery of a prophet , am i ?
1	fearless bellerophon killed them all
1	your great father destroyed the sacred heights of troy , thanks , of course , to a man 's stupidity , proud laomedon
1	remember , each of you , sons , wives , wealth , parents — are mother and father dead or alive ?
1	then , for the first time the full horror came home to me at last
1	remember — let no loss of memory overcome you when the sweet grip of slumber sets you free
1	the city flowered for many years till king mezentius came to power—his brutal rule , barbaric force of arms
1	you alone know how and when to approach him , soothe his moods
1	meges killed pedaeus , antenor 's son , a bastard boy but lovely theano nursed him with close , loving care like her own children , just to please her husband
1	that man who robbed me of many sons , brave boys , cutting them down or selling them off as slaves , shipped to islands half the world away
1	well euchenor knew that boarding the ships for troy meant certain death : his father told him so
1	he 's their father — they have to obey his orders
1	i go to visit them and dissolve their endless feud — how long they have held back from each other now , from making love , since anger struck their hearts
1	the last lot , deep in the helm , was acestes ’ own , who dared to try his hand at young men ’ s work
1	mingling in stock alone , the trojans will subside
1	so you gods have willed
1	and trust to it now , we ’ re heading for a battle
1	this gleaming trophy he gives the fine young runner
1	but the fine spearman automedon found a cure for that — drawing his long sharp sword from his sturdy thigh he leapt with a stroke to cut the trace horse free — it worked
1	and so the achaeans stampeded now , unearthly terror , all of them routed now by father zeus and hector — though hector killed just one
1	so apollo staged the action
1	but hector , his helmet flashing , answered nothing — he swept past him , hector burning to thrust the argives back at once and tear the life and soul out of whole battalions
1	and any god i catch , breaking ranks with us , eager to go and help the trojans or achaeans — back he comes to olympus , whipped by the lightning , eternally disgraced
1	in that spirit he went to the river ’ s edge , drew pure water up from the brimming banks and prayed to the gods , over and over , weighing down the heavens with his vows
1	never — how could he slip past the sentries unchallenged ?
1	the armies roared applause
1	my heart is torn in two as i try to weigh all this
1	but zeus 's daughter athena spurred the argives on — athena first in glory , third-born of the gods — whenever she saw some slacker hanging back as she hurtled through the onset
1	he killed eetion , not that he stripped his gear — he would some respect at least — for he burned his corpse in all his blazoned bronze , then heaped a grave-mound high above the ashes and nymphs of the mountain planted elms around it , daughters of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder
1	they tore the weasel-cap from the head , stripped the wolf pelt , the reflex bow and long tough spear and swinging the trophies high to pallas queen of plunder , exultant royal odysseus shouted out this prayer : here , goddess , rejoice in these , they are yours !
1	pygmalion , catching sychaeus off guard at the altar , slaughtered him in blood
1	and his wife bore good bellerophon three children : isander , hippolochus and laodamia
1	you called them your hosts , once , and the fathers of your brides !
1	now , leaning his weight upon that kingly scepter , atrides declared his will to all achaea 's armies : friends — fighting danaans , aides-in-arms of ares !
1	here , the victor and vanquished , i stretch my hands to you , so the men of latium have seen me in defeat
1	turnus can find his allies for himself
1	here , before you all , i will name in full the splendid gifts i offer
1	and they closely skirt the coasts of circe ’ s land where the sun ’ s rich daughter makes her deadly groves resound with her endless song , and deep in her proud halls she kindles fragrant cedar flaring through the night as her whirring shuttle sweeps her fine-spun loom
1	and struck sthenelaus , ithaemenes ' favorite son — a big rock to the neck snapped the tendons strung to the skull 's base
1	quick as the wind the rushing iris answered , hera winged me on , the illustrious wife of zeus
1	we raided thebe once , eetion 's sacred citadel , we ravaged the place , hauled all the plunder here and the armies passed it round , share and share alike , and they chose the beauty chryseis for agamemnon
1	you will find them a trial , though you are my wife
1	if fight we must
1	lift up your eyes and search , and once you find it , duly pluck it off with your hand
1	whatever falls to us now , we both will share one peril , one path to safety
1	phrygian women—that ’ s what you are—not phrygian men !
1	and once they would gathered , crowding the meeting grounds , they first put out the fires with glistening wine , wherever the flames still burned in all their fury
1	but bronze glanced off bronze and never grazed firm flesh , the helmet blocked it , triple-ply with the great blank hollow eyes , a gift of apollo
1	with a high thin cry
1	standing there dazed , your fighting spirit dead — what are you waiting for ?
1	three daughters are his in his well-built halls , chrysothemis and laodice and iphianassa — and you may lead away whichever one you like , with no bride-price asked , home to peleus ' house
1	some strike seeds of fire buried in veins of flint , some strip the dense thickets , lairs of wild beasts , and lighting on streams , are quick to point them out
1	recognizing his kin , he gladly leads us home , each word of welcome breaking through his tears
1	dares like some captain assaulting a steep city wall or laying siege to a mountain stronghold under arms , now this approach , now that , exploring the whole fort with skill , with every kind of assault , and all no use
1	oh , think back on the twists and turns of war
1	imbrasus had reared them himself in lycia once and equipped them both with matching weapons either to fight close-up or outrace the winds on horseback
1	we are allies bound as one
1	here asius flogged his team and chariot hard , nor did he find the gates shut , the bolt shot home , not yet , the men still held them wide , hoping to save some comrade fleeing the onset , racing for the ships
1	sail home to the fatherland we love !
1	long as the trojan stragglers took to their heels and ran , the weapon did its work , but once it came up against the immortal armor forged by the god of fire , vulcan , the mortal sword burst at a stroke , brittle as ice , and glinting splinters gleamed on the tawny sand
1	you , you were their greatest glory while you lived — now death and fate have seized you , dragged you down !
1	then i would gladly stand and fight for patroclus
1	should he drive back to the rout and soldier on ?
1	now you have robbed me of great glory , saved their lives with all your deathless ease
1	white terror seized them all
1	dead set now on that , he drove prince hector against the hollow hulls though the son of priam raged in his own right , raged like ares with brandished spear , or flash fire roaring down from a ridge into thick stands of timber
1	behind their backs he strapped their hands , the captives he planned to send below as gifts to appease the shades , sprinkling latin blood on the pyre that burned their corpses
1	so hector urged his armies
1	you keep guard at our back , so no patrol can attack us from the rear— you be on the alert , a hawk ’ s eye all around
1	and in their midst the brilliant achilles began to arm for battle
1	your ghost , my father , he replied , your grieving ghost , so often it came and urged me to your threshold !
1	the rest fought on like a mass of whirling fire
1	he was the first to launch a spear against you , patroclus o my rider , but did not bring you down
1	is this our reward for reverence , this the way you give us back our throne ?
1	you will never set your eyes on the day of doom that topples looming troy
1	and into the traces he ran the purebred bold dancer — achilles seized him once when he stormed eetion 's city , a mortal war-horse pacing immortal horses now
1	a thousand men he rushes aboard , tight ranks spiked with spears
1	scatter out from port on different routes
1	seize your moment now
1	so now , out of epean spoils , the old king chose a herd of cattle and handsome flock of sheep , three hundred head he picked , the herdsmen too
1	the conqueror of asia
1	but patroclus nerved for battle dressed him down : meriones , brave as you are , why bluster on this way ?
1	what can he dare say now to the queen in all her fury and win her over ?
1	down he strode from olympus ' peaks , storming at heart with his bow and hooded quiver slung across his shoulders
1	if not , atrides , that outrage would have been your last !
1	there we can go to bed at once — since love is now your pleasure !
1	and the heralds cried out at the break of day , 'pylians — come collect your debts from wealthy elis !
1	no taking us off guard , no hanging back , no dread must cripple our steps with anxious second thoughts when the gods allow us to pull our standards up , strike camp , and move the army out
1	rocks heaved by a catapult pounding city ramparts never storm so loudly , never such a shattering bolt of thunder crashing forth
1	royal son of laertes , great tactician — come , home we go now
1	and next aeneas returns to his ships and shipmates , picks the best and bravest to take his lead in war while the rest glide on at ease , no oars required as the river ’ s current bears them on downstream to bring ascanius news of his father and his affairs
1	how great are the pains that priam and priam 's sons have heaped on you that you rage on , relentless , forever bent on razing the well-built heights of troy ?
1	and the tested veteran leonteus speared hippomachus , gouged antimachus ' offspring down across the belt , then drawing his long sharp sword from its sheath he rushed the front and took antiphates first with a quick thrust , stabbing at close range — he slammed on his back , sprawled along the ground
1	with that appeal , headlong down from the heights of heaven she dove , girt up in clouds , unfurling a whirlwind through the air and winging straight at the trojan ranks and latian camp
1	i swear by the skies up there , the stars , they know it all !
1	he is far too strong
1	you winds , you dare make heaven and earth a chaos , raising such a riot of waves without my blessings
1	first the leaders , antlers branching over their high heads , he brings them down , then turns on the herd , his shafts stampeding the rest like rabble into the leafy groves
1	father zeus has lopped the crowns of a thousand cities , true , and zeus will lop still more — his power is too great
1	so now you feel the weight of your mother 's curses — hera plotted against you , hera up in arms because you left the achaean forces in the lurch and rushed to defend these reckless , headlong trojans !
1	and suddenly hera taunted the father , son of cronus : so , who of the gods this time , my treacherous one , was hatching plans with you ?
1	you bear the brunt of troy 's and lycia 's fighting — you are our bravest men , whatever the enterprise , pitched battle itself or planning our campaigns , so stand your ground right here !
1	he begged the whole achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders , atreus ' two sons , and all ranks of achaeans cried out their assent , arespect the priest , accept the shining ransom !
1	go now , take your meal — the sooner to bring on war
1	there is the heat of love , the pulsing rush of longing , the lover 's whisper , irresistible — magic to make the sanest man go mad
1	— no wasted shot , it whizzed from his hand and punched the flat top of tydides ' right foot , the shaft dug through and stuck fast in the ground
1	now here the spear of aeneas had stuck , borne home by its hurling force , and the tough roots held it fast
1	but who of his guests would greet his enemy now , meet him face-to-face and ward off grisly death ?
1	this tradition of drill and these mock battles : ascanius was the first to revive the ride when he girded alba longa round with ramparts , teaching the early latins to keep these rites , just as he and his fellow trojan boys had done , and the albans taught their sons , and in her turn great rome received the rites and preserved our fathers ’ fame
1	catching her as she faints away , her women bear her back to her marble bridal chamber and lay her body down upon her bed
1	the story goes that ancient pelasgians , first in time long past to settle the latian borders , solemnized the grove and a festal day to silvanus , god of fields and flocks
1	but you must go alone , no other trojan attend you , only a herald with you , a seasoned , older one who can drive the mules and smooth-running wagon and bring the hero 's body back to sacred troy , the man that brilliant achilles killed in battle
1	olympian zeus commands you to ransom royal hector , to bear gifts to achilles , gifts to melt his rage
1	no kin , no women commit his corpse to the flames — the dogs will tear his flesh before our walls !
1	aeneas slaughtered medon and iasus outright , medon the bastard son of royal king oileus , little ajax ' brother , but medon lived in phylace , banished from native land — he would killed a kinsman dear to oileus ' wife , his stepmother eriopis
1	let me barter death as the price of fame
1	when he saw the wound where the tearing arrow hit , he sucked out the blood and deftly applied the healing salves that chiron , friend of asclepius , gave his father long ago
1	here the dolopians formed ranks— here savage achilles pitched his tents— over there the armada moored and here the familiar killing-fields of battle
1	just give me the strength to shield my grandson , bear him quite unscathed from the raw clash of arms
1	so much slaughter the trojan commander spreads throughout the plain like a stream in spate or black tornado storming on till at last the young ascanius and his troops break free and put the camp behind
1	but off in his beaked seagoing ships he lay , raging away at atrides agamemnon , king of armies , while his men sported along the surf , marking time , hurling the discus , throwing spears and testing bows
1	but if down deep some prophecy makes him balk , some doom his noble mother revealed to him from zeus , at least let achilles send patroclus into battle
1	— another born to die ?
1	and now , while the two made love in the large carved bed , menelaus stalked like a wild beast , up and down the lines — where could he catch a glimpse of magnificent paris ?
1	our long-haired achaeans routed again , driven in terror off the plain to crowd the ships , but why ?
1	the three cities that i love best of all are argos and sparta , mycenae with streets as broad as troy 's
1	so grief gives way to grief , my life one endless sorrow !
1	ever since my sychaeus , my poor husband met his fate , and my own brother shed his blood and stained our household gods , this is the only man who ’ s roused me deeply , swayed my wavering heart
1	she brings out robes shot through with gilded thread and a phrygian cloak for ascanius
1	lead black cattle there , first offerings of atonement
1	he finished othryoneus , a man who would lived in cabesus , one who had just come at the rousing word of war and asked for priam 's loveliest daughter , cassandra — with no bride-price offered — but othryoneus promised a mighty work of battle : he would rout the unwilling argives out of troy
1	father zeus , athena , apollo , if all my fighters had such courage pounding inside their chests , we would bring king priam 's citadel crashing down in an instant , sacked at our hands — annihilated
1	the terrible blazing of those eyes , and his winged words went flying : why , why now ?
1	altars ring the pyre
1	and following turnus comes a cloud of troops on foot , shield-bearing battalions swarming the whole plain
1	and first he gave his drivers strict commands to rein their teams back hard and never panic , no fouling them in the onslaught : let no man , so sure of his horsemanship and soldier 's prowess , dare to fight it out alone with the trojans , exposed in front of his lines
1	these were her parting words and for all my tears—i longed to say so much— dissolving into the empty air she left me now
1	but far away , high on a mountain lookout , quite amazed to see the fleet of his old friends coming in , acestes rushes down to meet them there—a wild figure bristling spears and a libyan she-bear ’ s hide
1	so often he hangs back , with no heart for the work , not that he shrinks from action , skittish or off guard — it 's just that he looks to me , waiting for me to make the first move
1	what cause , what craving has sailed your ships to italy , crossing many seas ?
1	so now the open sea is blocked to the trojans , no escape , no hope
1	back through stakes and across the trench they fled , and hordes were cut down at the trojans ' hands — the rest , only after they reached the shipways , stood fast and shouting out to each other , flung their arms to all the immortals , each man crying out a prayer
1	aeneas rises from his high seat and first he rakes the fires asleep on hercules ’ altar , then gladly goes to the lowly gods of hearth and home he worshipped just the day before
1	aeneas , the guest of honor , he invites to a throne of maple , cushioned soft with a shaggy lion ’ s hide
1	shifting on her glistening feet , the goddess answered , why
1	by your sacred head , by the bed of our own marriage that i , at least , would never take in vain
1	hector looked up , saw him , started to tremble , nerve gone , he could hold his ground no longer , he left the gates behind and away he fled in fear — and achilles went for him , fast , sure of his speed as the wild mountain hawk , the quickest thing on wings , launching smoothly , swooping down on a cringing dove and the dove flits out from under , the hawk screaming over the quarry , plunging over and over , his fury driving him down to beak and tear his kill — so achilles flew at him , breakneck on in fury with hector fleeing along the walls of troy , fast as his legs would go
1	or a young woman , is it ?
1	the grand palace of priam would stand once more , with my own hands i would fortify a second troy to house my trojans in defeat
1	next in the draw came hardy lord eumelus , atrides menelaus the famous spearman next and meriones drew the fourth starting-lane and tydides diomedes drew the fifth and last , the best of them all by far at driving battle-teams
1	the king of the gods , whose power sways earth and sky— he is the one who sends me down from brilliant olympus , bearing commands for you through the racing winds
1	i shrink from mounting our chariot — no retreat — on foot as i am , i will meet them man-to-man
1	the woods and savage seas are calm , at rest , and the circling stars are gliding on in their midnight courses , all the fields lie hushed and the flocks and gay and gorgeous birds that haunt the deep clear pools and the thorny country thickets all lie quiet now , under the silent night , asleep
1	men say i am his son
1	dido , oh poor fool , is it only now your wicked work strikes home ?
1	i will never forget him , not as long as i am still among the living and my springing knees will lift and drive me on
1	the son , the father , the whole trojan line—i should have wiped them out , then hurled myself on the pyre to crown it all !
1	they grouped on the meeting grounds , morale broken
1	but our far-flung friends , they are fast asleep , they leave the watch to us — their wives and children are hardly camped nearby
1	here , accept these gifts , this ransom
1	only then can you set eyes on the stygian groves and the realms no living man has ever trod
1	there was a custom in latium , land of the west , and ever after revered in alban towns and now great rome that rules the world reveres it too , when men first rouse the war-god into action , whether bent on bringing the griefs of war to the getae , the hyrcanians , or the arabs or marching on india , out to stalk the dawn and reclaim the standards taken by the parthians
1	indeed , i ’ ll send out trusty men to scour the coast of libya far and wide
1	all for a girl , just one , and here we offer you seven — outstanding beauties — that , and a treasure trove besides
1	rubbing his tears off dumbly with a fist
1	you , they say , the river-nymph sebethis once bore telon , an old man now , when telon ruled over capreae , the teleboean isle
1	in the same breath the god apollo dives from the vaulting skies and cleaving the gusty winds searches for ascanius
1	deep below it a vast cavern thunders , hollowed out like vaults under etna , forming the cyclops ’ forges
1	now i was his blood kin , a youngster when my father , a poor man , sent me off to the war at troy as palamedes ’ comrade
1	now i am determined to praise you all the more , you who dared — seeing me in these straits — to venture out from the walls , all for my sake , while the others stay inside and cling to safety
1	we can not find a thing
1	the cretan captain idomeneus answered , thoas — no man 's to blame now , so far as i can tell
1	his chariot 's finished off with gold and silver , the armor he 's brought in with him , gold too , tremendous equipment — what a marvelous sight
1	so up i went to him , eagerly showed him round the walls of pheneus
1	he 's the one they will obey
1	mnestheus hands nisus a fine shaggy hide stripped from a lion , and trusty old aletes exchanges helmets with him
1	why such fear , such terror ?
1	his mother clutched his hand and urged him , called his name : my child — why have you left the bitter fighting , why have you come home ?
1	with that concession the prince sat down again
1	and laying the victims in the chariot , noble priam climbed aboard , pulling the reins back taut
1	you and your boy there , you grand and glorious powers
1	at last a piercing blare of the trumpet—suddenly all the ships burst forth from the line , no stopping them now , the shouts of the sailors hit the skies , the oarsmen ’ s arms pull back to their chests as they whip the swells to foam
1	and the herald took it round through all the ranks , left to right for luck , and showed it to all achaea 's bravest men
1	and with that he swung their racers round , mid-flight , back again to the rout — trojans and hector after them , shouting their savage cries and pelting both men now with spears and painful arrows
1	so keen to be gone , the men drag down from the forest untrimmed timbers and boughs still green for oars
1	but first i had better set to rest the flood you ruffled so
1	then for a third test he brought the amazons down , a match for men in war
1	but their feathers take no stab-wounds , backs no scars and swift on their wings they soar toward the heavens , leaving behind half-eaten prey and trails of filth
1	father zeus has lopped the crowns of a thousand cities , true , and zeus will lop still more — his power is too great
1	that man who drags patroclus back to trojan charioteers , dead as patroclus is , and makes great ajax yield — to him i will give one half the bloody spoils , keep half for myself — his glory will equal mine !
1	the archer loosed a fresh shaft from the bowstring straight for hector , his spirit longing to hit him — but he missed and cut gorgythion down instead , a well-bred son of priam , a handsome prince , and the arrow pierced his chest , gorgythion whom priam 's bride from aesyme bore one day , lovely castianira lithe as a deathless goddess
1	they quickly lowered the chest in a deep , hollow grave and over it piled a cope of huge stones closely set , then hastily heaped a barrow , posted lookouts all around for fear the achaean combat troops would launch their attack before the time agreed
1	do not let your spirit turn you down that path , dear boy
1	we were all witnesses then
1	so he warned but failed to shake euphorbus who shot right back , now , high and mighty atrides , now by heaven you pay in blood for the brother you laid low !
1	then out he went on foot to range the ranks
1	i swear by aeneas ’ fate , by his right hand proved staunch in loyalty , strong in feats of arms , that many nations , many—and don ’ t slight us now because we come with an olive branch held out and desperate pleas—that many people have urged us , strongly , to join them as allies
1	he 's off to the fast ships to tell the swift achilles
1	now there would have been havoc , irreversible chaos , the trojans penned in the walls of troy like sheep , but the father of men and gods was quick to the mark
1	others harness teams to chariots , others vault up onto their horses , swords brandished , tense for attack
1	no other achaean fighter could heft that shaft , only achilles had the skill to wield it well : pelian ash it was , a gift to his father peleus presented by chiron once , hewn on pelion 's crest to be the death of heroes
1	aeneas cries to achates : give me a sheaf of weapons !
1	what did you feel then , dido , seeing this ?
1	shall the country look on turnus in full retreat ?
1	now , yes , you have ransomed your dear son — for a king 's ransom
1	nor can they tear themselves away till the dank night comes wheeling round the heavens studded with fiery stars
1	what violence lands you on this frightful coast ?
1	if the trojans had that courage , unswerving courage that fires men who fight for their own country , beating their enemies down in war and struggle , then we could drag patroclus back to troy at once
1	it 's obvious — any fool can see it
1	but lausus , seeing it all , groaned low with the love he bore his father , tears poured down his face and now , lausus , your fated , brutal death and your brave deeds— if glorious work long ages old can win belief— neither your record nor yourself will i ever fail to sing , young soldier , you deserve our praise
1	till i can return to troy and tell them all , the old counselors , all our wives , to pray to the gods and vow to offer them many splendid victims
1	only yesterday zeus went off to the ocean river to feast with the aethiopians , loyal , lordly men , and all the gods went with him
1	those borne by the stream have found their graves
1	but you and your anger !
1	mnestheus , fierce serestus are spurring on the work , the men whom captain aeneas charged , should crisis call , to marshal troops in ranks and take command of the outpost
1	he always gave us gifts to warm our hearts , gifts for the gods who rule the vaulting skies
1	futile — she could never seduce the man 's strong will , his seasoned , firm resolve
1	the beast won ’ t move into battle till he takes a deep wound in his chest from the hunters , then he revels in combat , tossing the rippling mane on his neck he snaps the spear some stalker drove in his flesh and roars from bloody jaws , without a fear in the world
1	trojans , tyrians : they will be all the same to me
1	but collect it , call it back from the rank and file ?
1	what fine bearing , the man himself !
1	gear up for battle now !
1	so the soldiers bantered but not odysseus
1	or did hector send you out to spy on our ships , reconnoiter them stem to stern ?
1	and then , from that day on , i will turn the tide of war : back the fighting goes , no stopping it , ever , all the way till achaean armies seize the beetling heights of troy through athena 's grand design
1	so the crash of the breakers all fell silent once their father , gazing over his realm under clear skies , flicks his horses , giving them free rein , and his eager chariot flies
1	all ranks held their peace but diomedes lord of the war cry spoke up briskly : nestor , the mission stirs my fighting blood
1	men in their prime from argos , ranks of auruncans , rutulians , sicanian veterans on in years , sacranians in columns , labicians bearing their painted shields , men who plow your glades , old tiber , the numicus ’ holy banks , whose plowshare turns the rutulian slopes and circe ’ s high-ridged cape
1	then the famous horseman peleus took me into his halls , he reared me with kindness , appointed me your aide
1	but now — quickly , call up the wild joy of war at once !
1	shore clash with shore , sea against sea and sword against sword—this is my curse—war between all our peoples , all their children , endless war !
1	but diomedes lord of the war cry answered , right , old soldier — all you say is true
1	still , here i stay on olympus throned aloft , here in my steep mountain cleft , to feast my eyes and delight my heart
1	and shining hector was first to hurl his spear — at the giant ajax veering into him , full face — a direct hit where two straps crossed his chest , one for the shield , one for the silver-studded sword but both flexed taut to guard his glistening skin
1	so he vowed and brilliant achilles strode back to his shelter , sat down on the well-carved chair that he had left , at the far wall of the room , leaned toward priam and firmly spoke the words the king had come to hear : your son is now set free , old man , as you requested
1	agamemnon took his seat and nestor rose among them
1	but wait : let us question a holy man , a prophet , even a man skilled with dreams — dreams as well can come our way from zeus — come , someone to tell us why apollo rages so , whether he blames us for a vow we failed , or sacrifice
1	from the rest achaean soldiers bought their rations , some with bronze and some with gleaming iron , some with hides , some with whole live cattle , some with slaves , and they made a handsome feast
1	and heracles ' son tlepolemus tall and staunch led nine ships of the proud rhodians out of rhodes , the men who lived on rhodes in three island divisions , lindos and ialysus and camirus ' white escarpment , armies led by the famous spearman tlepolemus whom astyochea bore to heracles filled with power
1	any fighter , cut off from his wife for one month , would chafe at the benches , moaning in his ship , pinned down by gales and heavy , raging seas
1	and at last achilles , turning away from the corpse-fire , sank down , exhausted
1	and some are working the bellows sucking the air in , blasting it out , while others are plunging hissing bronze in the brimming troughs , the ground of the cavern groaning under the anvils ’ weight , and the cyclops raising their arms with all their power , arms up , arms down to the drumming , pounding beat as they twist the molten mass in gripping tongs
1	you have a thousand names , a thousand deadly arts
1	once they are packed in the walls and catch their breath , close the thickset gates and bolt them tight again
1	so i must speak up and drive the matter home
1	quickly , lords of the argives , all my captains , judge between us — impartially , no favoritism — so none of our bronze-armed men can ever say , 'only with lies did atrides beat antilochus out and walk off with the mare — his team was far slower but the king 's own rank and power took the prize !
1	we will fight again tomorrow — until some fatal power decides between us both , handing victory down to one side or the other
1	no rustic free-for-all with clubs and charred stakes— they ’ ll fight to the finish now with two-edged swords
1	no stranger to wild goats who graze it when flying arrows are planted in their backs
1	and i , cast from my country , bound for the ocean ’ s ends— irresistible fortune and inescapable fate have planted me in this place , spurred on by my mother ’ s dire warnings , the nymph carmentis , and god apollo ’ s power
1	never abate your fury !
1	we can supply the bronze , the shipwrights , docks and tackle
1	my great home is here , my fountainhead gives rise to noble cities
1	away with you now
1	look , a world away from his fatherland he 's perished , lacking me , my fighting strength , to defend him
1	enflamed by his taunts and watching his brilliant work , the arcadians , armed with grief and shame , stand braced to meet the enemy
1	at the same time zeus the father whipped his team and hurtling chariot straight from ida to mount olympus , soon to reach the sessions of the gods
1	then captain aeneas calls from his high stern , his hands extending the olive branch of peace : we ’ re trojans born
1	they seize some galleys set to sail , load them with gold— the wealth pygmalion craved—and they bear it overseas and a woman leads them all
1	the spears recede , the flames roll back before me
1	your turn now — keep on shielding our fast ships from this latest mass attack
1	comrades heaved him up and swept him clear of the fighting , far downfield till they gained his team of racers standing behind the rear lines and rush of battle , their driver and blazoned chariot held in tow
1	and the swift runner achilles reassured him warmly : why have you returned to me here , dear brother , friend ?
1	or pity me , you , great father of gods , and whirl this hated body down to hell with a bolt , the only way i know to burst the chains of this , this brutal life !
1	so he urged and hector obeyed his brother start to finish
1	now what wails of men will the field of mars send up to mars ’ tremendous city !
1	captains fight and die now the gates of mighty olympus ’ house are flung wide open
1	hunting the dark glens , day after day , we ’ ve scouted the city ’ s outposts , reconnoitered every bend in the river
1	his voice so firm that achilles caused the other kings to scatter
1	their cries rang out
1	so they embark with cheers to speed them on their way and the dark tarred hulls go gliding through the river , amazing the tides , amazing the groves unused to the sight of warriors ’ shields , flashing far , and blazoned galleys moving on upstream
1	aeneas the hero , god of the land : you know yourself , you confess you know that he is heaven bound , his fate will raise aeneas to the stars
1	we will never take the broad streets of troy
1	his groans convince us , cutting all our show of violence short
1	then priam and herald , minds set on the journey home , bedded down for the night within the porch 's shelter
1	but you , poor men , run now , run for your lives , cut your hawsers , sail away !
1	trojans , never trust that horse
1	they scatter to posts and man the watch by turns or stretching out on the grass , enjoy their wine , tilting the bronze bowls while the fires burn on and the watchmen dice away a sleepless night
1	book seven : ajax duels with hector
1	i will obey you , your demands
1	terror gripped the fighters looking on , stallion-breaking trojans , argive men-at-arms
1	but now , as it is , the fates of death await us , thousands poised to strike , and not a man alive can flee them or escape — so in we go for attack !
1	both of you — fight to save the achaean armies , call up your courage , no cringing panic now !
1	then at last i saw it all , all ilium settling into her embers , neptune ’ s troy , toppling over now from her roots like a proud , veteran ash on its mountain summit , chopped by stroke after stroke of the iron axe as woodsmen fight to bring it down , and over and over it threatens to fall , its boughs shudder , its leafy crown quakes and back and forth it sways till overwhelmed by its wounds , with a long last groan it goes—torn up from its heights it crashes down in ruins from its ridge
1	till now i would hoped , hoped with all my heart that i alone would die far from the stallion-land of argos , here in troy , but you , patroclus , would journey back to phthia and then you would ferry neoptolemus home from scyros , fast in your black ship , and show him all my wealth , my servingmen , my great house with the high vaulting roof
1	and the murderer lives on in his own country — the man has paid enough , and the injured kinsman curbs his pride , his smoldering , vengeful spirit , once he takes the price
1	call off this skirmish of ours at once — let these mortals fight themselves to death
1	how to exalt achilles ?
1	then , out of thin mist the goddess creates a phantom : aeneas ’ double , but a strange , unearthly sight , a shadow stripped of power , and decking it out in trojan armor , matching the shield and crest on aeneas ’ godlike head , she fills it with hollow words , gives it a voice , sound without sense , and it apes his marching stride
1	trust in the tale is old , yet its fame will never die
1	at this point , venus , shocked by the unfair pain her son endures , culls with a mother ’ s care some dittany fresh from cretan ida , spear erect with its tender leaves and crown of purple flowers
1	how well i recall the face , the words , the voice of your father , king anchises
1	forget the orders — nothing to fear , my friend , neither ares nor any other god
1	set sail now , the god commands , blest in the dedication of your son
1	the fates will find the way
1	again the iron warrior brought his brother round — good counsel , fitting too
1	icy shudders rack my limbs—my blood chills with fear
1	hurry , head our chariot right where the fighting 's thickest , there — horse and infantry hurling into the slaughter , hacking each other down , terrific war cries rising !
1	so you go back to the great men of achaea
1	he 's knocked the bow from my grip , snapped the string , the fresh gut i tied to the weapon just at dawn to launch the showers of arrows i would let fly
1	but high-hearted tydides drove away the team and gave them to aides to lash both horses back to the hollow ships
1	now hera poised on her golden throne looked down , stationed high at her post aloft olympus ' peak
1	my hand on his altar now , i swear by the gods and fires that rise between us here , the day will never dawn when italian men will break this pact , this peace , however fortune falls
1	then he turns to his comrades , bands of officers pressing round him there , and aeneas starts in to stir their spirits flushed with recent triumph : what magnificent things we ’ ve done , my friends !
1	they murmured low but priam , raising his voice , called across to helen , come over here , dear child
1	finally diomedes lord of the war cry shouted out , no one touch the treasures of paris , helen either !
1	five flocks of cattle he had in tow and five came home from pasture , a hundred plowshares made his topsoil churn
1	camilla ’ s life breath fled with a groan of outrage down to the shades below
1	with that , he fled into thin air like a wisp of smoke
1	may turnus see me stripping the bloody armor off his body , bear the sight of his conqueror—eyes dulled in death !
1	you tell me that i ca not stand up to monstrous ajax ?
1	and telamonian ajax struck anthemion 's son , the hardy stripling simoisius , still unwed
1	praying , his mind at sea , wavering here , there , crazed by his own disgrace—should he fling himself on his sword and thrust the ruthless blade through his ribs ?
1	hurry , my friend , this way — fight for dead patroclus !
1	first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves , fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps , next he strapped a breastplate round his chest , his brother lycaon 's that fitted him so well
1	one more thing — take it to heart , i urge you
1	juno kept them far from latium , forced by the fates to wander round the seas of the world , year in , year out
1	at least we could bring his body back to achilles , stripped as patroclus is — but not achilles ' armor : hector with that flashing helmet has seized it all
1	and you too , turnus , would now be standing here , a tremendous trunk of oak decked out in armor if pallas had had your years and strength to match
1	permit me to risk the first shock of battle
1	ortilochus sired diodes , that proud heart , and diodes bred orsilochus twinned with crethon drilled for any fight
1	glaucus cried a prayer to the distant deadly archer : hear me , lord apollo !
1	so stop your babbling , mouthing the names of kings , flinging indecencies in their teeth , your eyes peeled for a chance to cut and run for home
1	let that man beware , or great and glorious as he is , we mighty gods will wheel on him in anger — look , he outrages the senseless clay in all his fury !
1	he fell with a crash as idomeneus boasted , shouting over him , bravo , othryoneus , bravo to you beyond all men alive !
1	but if farseeing zeus does not send you that sign — his own messenger — then i urge you , beg you , do not go down to the ships — not for all the passion in your heart !
1	just so torn , so slowly but surely turnus backs away , his spirit churning with anger
1	once they would dragged the bodies back to their lines they dropped the luckless twins in companions ' open arms and round they swung again to fight in the first ranks
1	he claims he is far greater than you in striking force , he is the first-born too !
1	but the day soon came when even bellerophon was hated by all the gods
1	as long as he lives he ’ ll never forget such meritorious service
1	both men armed at opposing sides of the forces , into the no man 's land between the lines they strode , glances menacing , wild excitement seizing all who watched , the stallion-breaking trojans and argive men-at-arms
1	once , when that tyrant , metabus , loathed by people for his abuse of power , was drummed from his kingdom , leaving privernum ’ s ancient town , he took his daughter , a baby , with him , fleeing the thick-and-fast of battle , a friend to share his exile
1	quick , whomever my eye will light on in review , the mission 's theirs
1	so , this woman , it struck me now , safe and sound she ’ ll look once more on sparta , her native greece ?
1	and now in his dreams it came again—the god , his phantom , the same features shining clear
1	yes , but even on him the father piled hardships , no powerful race of princes born in his royal halls , only a single son he fathered , doomed at birth , cut off in the spring of life — and i , i give the man no care as he grows old since here i sit in troy , far from my fatherland , a grief to you , a grief to all your children
1	with that he hurled his spear , his whole body behind it— whirring on through the dark night , it flies at sulmo and striking his turned back it splits—crack ! — and a splinter stabs his midriff through
1	she broke off , her voice choking with tears that brimmed and wet her breast
1	apollo pressed on , wading into the ruck , hurling argives back in chaos and handing glory to hector and all the trojan forces
1	but deiphobus ' strong swift hurl was not for nothing , no , he caught hypsenor , hippasus ' son the captain , struck him under the midriff , slit his liver and that instant the man 's knees went limp
1	go tell them to join in friendship , seal their pacts , now i ’ ve spattered the trojans red with italian blood
1	then round her shoulders she swirled the wondrous robes that athena wove her , brushed out to a high gloss and worked into the weft an elegant rose brocade
1	but we , if we lose our land , will bow to the yoke , enslaved by our new high lords and masters— we who idle on amid our fields !
1	but hector marked them across the lines and rushed them now with a cry and trojan shock troops backed him full strength
1	now turn your eyes this way and behold these people , your own roman people
1	and now with the strength of xanthus beaten down the two called off their battle
1	and so , give the command for carthage to crush italy , overwhelm her with force
1	so he cried and staunch atrides stripped the gear from the corpse and heaving the bloody bronze to eager comrades swung to attack again , frontline assault
1	go to olympus , plead with zeus , if you ever warmed his heart with a word or any action
1	not for all the world , nor will all the rest of achaea 's armies
1	the great mother of gods detains me on these shores
1	tlepolemus — far across the lines the armed achaeans hauled him out of the fight , and seasoned odysseus saw it , his brave spirit steady , ablaze for action now
1	so hector could never throw achilles off his trail , the swift racer achilles — time and again he would make a dash for the dardan gates , trying to rush beneath the rock-built ramparts , hoping men on the heights might save him , somehow , raining spears but time and again achilles would intercept him quickly , heading him off , forcing him out across the plain and always sprinting along the city side himself — endless as in a dream
1	our hard straits have forced me to set defenses , station guards along our far frontiers
1	so he dissolved again in the proud trojan lines , dreading atrides — magnificent , brave paris
1	then merops and erymas die at his hands , then aphidnus , even bitias , eyes ablaze , all rage at heart , and not by a spear—he ’ d never give up his life to a spear— a massive pike with a giant blade comes hurtling , roaring into him , driven home like a lightning bolt and neither the two bull ’ s-hides of his shield nor trusty breastplate , double-mailed with its scales of gold , can block its force
1	his cheeks stained with tears , and pressed by hunger the boy goes up to his father 's old companions , tugging at one man 's cloak , another 's tunic , and some will pity him , true , and one will give him a little cup to drink , enough to wet his lips , not quench his thirst
1	now pay for your father 's outrage , blood for blood !
1	— despite their desperate straits
1	for in my heart and soul i also know this well : the day will come when sacred troy must die , priam must die and all his people with him , priam who hurls the strong ash spear
1	someone less of a man than i will say , 'our hector — staking all on his own strength , he destroyed his army !
1	but charis saw her first , charis coming forward , lithe and lovely in all her glittering headdress , the grace the illustrious crippled smith had married
1	potitius set this altar in the grove
1	hail , true son of jove , you glory added to all the gods !
1	that man is atreus ' son agamemnon , lord of empires , both a mighty king and a strong spearman too , and he used to be my kinsman , whore that i am !
1	and i too , if the same fate waits for me
1	now left of the ships he sped where argive ranks would head home from the plain with teams and cars
1	god forbid that achilles sees me turning tail , heading from town and out to open country — he will come after me full tilt and run me down !
1	from that noble blood will arise a trojan caesar , his empire bound by the ocean , his glory by the stars : julius , a name passed down from iulus , his great forebear
1	come , let us give each other gifts , unforgettable gifts , so any man may say , trojan soldier or argive , 'first they fought with heart-devouring hatred , then they parted , bound by pacts of friendship
1	so mercury of cyllene flew between the earth and sky to gain the sandy coast of libya , cutting the winds that sweep down from his mother ’ s father , atlas
1	how he strangled the first monsters , twin serpents sent by his stepmother , juno—crushed them in his hands
1	now there ’ s no excuse for those craven sons of aeneas to break their word , to forsake the pact we swore
1	come , try me in combat , weapons hand-to-hand — bow and spattering shafts will never help you then
1	till we see if calchas divined the truth or not
1	now bone-weary , aeneas ’ shipmates make a run for the nearest landfall , wheeling prows around they turn for libya ’ s coast
1	yet stragglers still stampeded down the plain like cattle driven wild by a lion lunging in pitch darkness down on the whole herd but to one alone a sudden death comes flashing — first he snaps its neck , clamped in his huge jaws , then down in gulps he bolts its blood and guts
1	we will fight again tomorrow
1	— achilles the son of sleek-haired thetis may outrace me — struck by my spear first — and gasp away his life !
1	were the men still alive or just in the last throes , forever lost to their comrades ’ far-flung calls ?
1	and one of these , in the waist where the braided belt chafes the flesh and the buckle clasps the strap from end to end— a striking , well-built soldier in burnished bronze— the spear splits his ribs and splays him out on the sand
1	seeing their close-packed ranks , hot for battle , i spur them on their way : men , brave hearts , though bravery can not save us—if you ’ re bent on following me and risking all to face the worst , look around you , see how our chances stand
1	the white-armed goddess hera could not resist
1	so then , hera , if you mean what you say , down to the last word , go back now to the deathless tribes of gods and summon iris to come before my presence , summon apollo too , lord of the famous bow
1	around it hovered numberless races , nations of souls like bees in meadowlands on a cloudless summer day that settle on flowers , riots of color , swarming round the lilies ’ lustrous sheen , and the whole field comes alive with a humming murmur
1	— blazing achilles broke in quickly — what a worthless , burnt-out coward i would be called if i would submit to you and all your orders , whatever you blurt out
1	what god drove them to fight with such a fury ?
1	so , concealing his ships in the sheltered woody narrows overarched by rocks and screened around by trees and trembling shade , aeneas moves out , with only achates at his side , two steel-tipped javelins balanced in his grip
1	and his sword-hilt is studded with tawny jasper stars , a cloak of glowing tyrian purple drapes his shoulders , a gift that the wealthy queen had made herself , weaving into the weft a glinting mesh of gold
1	sing to me now , you muses who hold the halls of olympus , who was the first to go up against king agamemnon , who of the trojans or famous trojan allies ?
1	now he no longer haunted the meeting grounds where men win glory , now he no longer went to war but day after day he ground his heart out , waiting there , yearning , always yearning for battle cries and combat
1	he summons the east- and westwind , takes them to task : what insolence !
1	glad for the lucky sign , odysseus prayed to pallas , hear me , daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder !
1	or capys perhaps , or caicus ’ stern adorned with shields ?
1	and paris , magnificent as a god , replied , hector , bent on faulting a man without a fault ?
1	mummius her he will conquer corinth and , famed for killing achaeans , drive his victor ’ s chariot up the capitol ’ s heights
1	and the famous crippled smith exclaimed warmly , thetis — here ?
1	he flung his shaft , missing the man on purpose — over his right shoulder the sharp spearpoint winged and stabbed the earth
1	and the dark blood — wash it out of the wound with clear warm water
1	here ’ s ornytus riding his calabrian charger in from a distance , all decked out in exotic armor , the huntsman setting up for a soldier
1	here they impaled me , an iron planting of lances covered my body—now they sprout in stabbing spears !
1	sisyphus , aeolus ' son , who had a son called glaucus , and in his day glaucus sired brave bellerophon , a man without a fault
1	what skill do i have to lengthen out your life ?
1	now take your evening meal throughout the city , just as you always have , and stand your watches , each man wide awake
1	no seas to plow , no questing after italian fields forever receding on the horizon
1	you see the coast is clear , our ships and friends restored
1	ares there — and for all his war cries diomedes shrank at the sight , as a man at a loss , helpless , crossing a vast plain halts short at a river rapids surging out to sea , takes one look at the water roaring up in foam and springs back with a leap
1	even now they warm the winter , long as it lasts , with obscene desire , oblivious to their kingdoms , abject thralls of lust
1	no , there he lies — still there at achilles ' ship , still intact in his shelters
1	a murderous feud broke out between both men
1	and you with your cunning , forge his appearance—just one night , no more—put on the familiar features of the boy , boy that you are , so when the wine flows free at the royal board and dido , lost in joy , cradles you in her lap , caressing , kissing you gently , you can breathe your secret fire into her , poison the queen and she will never know
1	they had no notion of custom , no cultured way of life , knew nothing of yoking oxen , laying away provisions , garnering up their stores
1	i grant your wish
1	anchors run from prows , the sterns line the shore
1	squeezing the nock and string together , drawing the gut back to his nipple , iron head to the handgrip till he flexed the great weapon back in a half-circle curve — the bow sprang !
1	each trojan soldier glancing left and right — how could he run from sudden , plunging death ?
1	fill my arms with lilies , let me scatter flowers , lustrous roses—piling high these gifts , at least , on our descendant ’ s shade—and perform a futile rite
1	deadlock : there man killed man in the pell-mell clash of battle , captains going at captains
1	they say there are twin curses called the furies
1	some beat out a dance with their feet and chant their songs
1	berserk for blood , he will find it uphill work to beat their valor down , matchless hands at war , and gut our ships with fire — unless almighty zeus should fling a torch at the fast trim ships himself
1	a torrent of questions—weeping futile tears , she sobs her long lament as priam ’ s warrior son , helenus , comes from the walls with full cortege
1	and there he dropped and slept the sleep of bronze , poor soldier , striving to help his fellow trojans , far from his wedded wife , his new bride
1	both fighters at one great stroke chopped at each other — pisander hacked the horn of the horsehair-crested helmet right at its ridge , lunging as menelaus hacked pisander between the eyes , the bridge of the nose , and bone cracked , blood sprayed and both eyes dropped at his feet to mix in the dust — he curled and crashed
1	all my lovely rapids are crammed with corpses now , no channel in sight to sweep my currents out to sacred sea — i am choked with corpses and still you slaughter more , you blot out more !
1	you must not , lost in the flush and fire of triumph , slaughtering trojans outright , drive your troops to troy — what if one of the gods who never die comes down from olympus heights to intervene in battle ?
1	so venus asked and the son of venus answered : not one of your sisters have i seen or heard
1	she looked like a young girl , a spartan girl decked out in dress and gear or thracian harpalyce tiring out her mares , outracing the hebrus river ’ s rapid tides
1	all obey me now
1	or iris sped from the clouds ?
1	they reforge in the furnace all their fathers ’ swords
1	i beg him—pity your sister , anna—one last favor , and if he grants it now , i ’ ll pay him back , with interest , when i die
1	the men themselves , wading into the sea , washed off the crusted sweat from shins and necks and thighs
1	balancing these on a facing gate , the land of crete comes rising from the sea
1	so polydamas stood by headstrong hector , warning , hector — and all our trojan captains , allies-in-arms !
1	this man 's body for prothoenor 's !
1	we have fought the good fight with all our kingdom ’ s power
1	flung from the car he writhes on the field in death as righteous aeneas sends some bitter words his way : lucagus , no panicked pair has let your chariot down , no horses shying away from an enemy ’ s empty shade— it ’ s you , tumbling off your chariot , you desert your team !
1	there — hector 's signal !
1	triumphant , the rutulians gathered their battle-plunder , weeping now as they bore the lifeless body of volcens back to camp
1	as luck would have it , that day arcadia ’ s king was holding solemn annual rites in honor of hercules , amphitryon ’ s powerful son , and paying vows to the gods in a grove before the city
1	too well i know that ares leads the charge
1	waiting for others to do your fighting for you ?
1	never again , i trust , will achilles yield to you
1	he was bred in the land of ithaca
1	and brilliant achilles shook his head at the armies , never letting them hurl their sharp spears at hector — someone might snatch the glory , achilles come in second
1	no mercy , please , turnus pleaded
1	huge as a masoned pier that falls at times on the shore of euboean baiae—first they build it of massive blocks , then send it crashing over , dragging all in its wake and it crushes down on the ocean floor as the waves roil and black sand goes heaving into the air and prochyta island quakes to its depths and the craggy bed of inarime weighting typhoeus down by jove ’ s command
1	fate crushed him , and hera 's savage anger
1	all or nothing — he charges flocks and hauls off bloody prey or he 's run through himself at the first assault with a fast spear driven home
1	achilles — he 's made his own proud spirit so wild in his chest , so savage , not a thought for his comrades ' love — we honored him past all others by the ships
1	but murderous achilles — you gods , you choose to help achilles
1	they first put out the fires with glistening wine , far as the flames had spread and the ashes bedded deep
1	but a new portent strikes our doomed people now—a greater omen , far more terrible , fatal , shakes our senses , blind to what was coming
1	whoever begs his mercy he will spare with all the kindness in his heart !
1	nestor the noble old horseman led those troops in ninety sweeping ships lined up along the shore
1	after them , faster — full gallop — i will find the way , i have got the skill to slip past him there where the track narrows — i will never miss my chance !
1	nor did he miss his sister juno ’ s cunning wrath at work
1	they were the first to trample on our pact
1	but capaneus ' headstrong son lashed back in style : do not lie , atrides !
1	what trust they put in their own blind luck !
1	thankful for my return they will go to meet the gods and sing their praises
1	so he commanded and the armies gave a deep resounding roar like waves crashing against a cliff when the south wind whips it , bearing down , some craggy headland jutting out to sea — the waves will never leave it in peace , thrashed by gales that hit from every quarter , breakers left and right
1	with that sharp warning athena seated headlong ares on his throne
1	now i recall how she ’ d reveal our destination , hesperia : time and again repeating it by name , repeating the name of italy
1	what god , you muses , warded off such savage flames from the trojans ?
1	you want this flashing hector to take the fleet then each man walk the waves to regain his native land ?
1	strongly as he longs to ease and allay her sorrow , speak to her , turn away her anguish with reassurance , still , moaning deeply , heart shattered by his great love , in spite of all he obeys the gods ’ commands and back he goes to his ships
1	there , yes , where you see the massive ramparts shattered , blocks wrenched from blocks , the billowing smoke and ash— it ’ s neptune himself , prising loose with his giant trident the foundation-stones of troy , he ’ s making the walls quake , ripping up the entire city by her roots
1	fortune fills our sails in that first clash and coroebus , flushed , fired with such success , exults : comrades , wherever fortune points the way , wherever the first road to safety leads , let ’ s soldier on
1	achaean troops will never hold the line , i tell you , not while the long ships are being hauled to sea
1	he hears us , wheels to follow our splashing oars but he has no chance to seize us in his clutches , he ’ s no match for ionian tides in his pursuit , so he gives a tremendous howl that shakes the sea and all its waves , all italy inland shudders in fear and etna ’ s echoing caverns bellow from their depths
1	the monster , immense , gargantuan , hideous—blind , his lone eye gone— clutching a pine-tree trunk to keep his footing firm
1	he would be the one to master an italy rife with leaders , shrill with the cries of war , to sire a people sprung from teucer ’ s noble blood and bring the entire world beneath the rule of law
1	and the first greek to cross our path ?
1	he rinsed his hands , took the cup from his wife and taking a stand amidst the forecourt , prayed , pouring the wine to earth and scanning the high skies , priam prayed in his rich resounding voice : father zeus !
1	brace for him , stand our ground together — beat him back !
1	themillas ’ spear grazed him first , he dropped his shield , the idiot , raised his hand to the gash as the arrow flew and digging deep in his left side , deeper , burst the ducts of his life breath with a deadly wound
1	but the other grazed achilles ' strong right arm and dark blood gushed as the spear shot past his back , stabbing the earth hard , still lusting to sink in flesh
1	take first prize and return to your hollow ships while we award this spear to the fighter meriones , if that would please your heart
1	that was his offer
1	let roman stock grow strong with italian strength
1	no blood-price came his way
1	an archer 's hit him , a good hand at the bow , some trojan or some lycian — all glory to him , a heavy blow to us !
1	a black cloud of grief came shrouding over achilles
1	pray for a safe return from all our mortal enemies , seeing you are dead set on going down to the ships — though you go against my will
1	but idomeneus never slacked his fury , always struggling to plunge some trojan soldier in deep shrouding night or fall himself , beating disaster off his lines
1	a herald ’ s ringing voice declares cloanthus the victor and aeneas crowns his brows with fresh green laurel
1	what , wait till turnus deigns to take me on ?
1	what hope can make you cling to the chilly clouds ?
1	and just as each of us hoped with all his heart he would dropped and died at the hands of giant ajax
1	king jupiter is the king to all alike
1	here the mothers and grief-stricken brides of the dead and their loving sisters , hearts torn with sorrow , and young boys robbed of their fathers— curse this horrendous war and turnus ’ marriage
1	what is he plotting now ?
1	achaeans stampeding back till they reined in hard , huddling tight by the sterns and shouting out to each other , flung their arms to all the immortals , each man crying out a prayer
1	my own fate and the deadly crimes of that spartan whore have plunged me in this hell
1	that left the famous spearman odysseus on his own , not a single argive comrade standing by his side since panic seized them all
1	up now , rouse our fighting-fury !
1	i ’ ve had no strife with trojans since troy fell , nor do i think of those old griefs with any joy
1	a ship chanced to be moored to a spur of cliff , her ladders and gangways set for action
1	but the known cowards he drove amidst the center : a man might cringe but he would be forced to fight
1	hang a great golden cable down from the heavens , lay hold of it , all you gods , all goddesses too : you can never drag me down from sky to earth , not zeus , the highest , mightiest king of kings , not even if you worked yourselves to death
1	he will go down to the house of death this instant , overwhelmed by achilles — all because he trusted the distant deadly archer 's urgings
1	periphetes , a mycenaean , favorite son of copreus , eurystheus ' herald who summoned rugged heracles time and again to grinding labors
1	dung stuffed his mouth , his nostrils dripped muck as shining long-enduring odysseus flashed past him to come in first by far and carry off the cup while ajax took the ox
1	corynaeus sealed the bones he culled in a bronze urn , then circling his comrades three times with pure water , sprinkling light drops from a blooming olive spray , he cleansed the men and voiced the last farewell
1	just so androgeos , seeing us , cringes with fear , recoiling , struggling to flee but we attack , flinging a ring of steel around his cohorts— panic takes the greeks unsure of their ground and we cut them all to pieces
1	these were the argive captains hector killed then went for the main mass like the west wind battering soft shining clouds the south wind wafts along — in deep explosive blasts it strikes and the great swelling waves roll on and on and the spray goes shooting up from under the wind 's hurl swerving , roaring down the sea — so wildly hector routed the packed lines of fighters caught in his onslaught
1	tell him this : leading chiefs of dardania come , pressing to be his friends-in-arms
1	the faces of girls , but birds !
1	and with that achilles stayed his burly hand on the silver hilt and slid the huge blade back in its sheath
1	now up comes iapyx , iasius ’ son , and dear to apollo , more than all other men , and once , in the anguished grip of love , the god himself gladly offered him all his own arts , his gifts , his prophetic skills , his lyre , his flying shafts
1	a swirl of thoughts goes racing through his mind , he glances toward his own rutulians and their town , he hangs back in dread , he quakes at death—it ’ s here
1	aeneas packs them off to death , talos , tanais , staunch cethegus , all three at a single charge , then grim onites too , named for his theban line , his mother called peridia
1	so , there ’ s no salvation in war , you say ?
1	with that , a stab of agony struck his deep heart
1	the old men of the realm held seats above the gates
1	he tells him mezentius musters fighters to his side , tells him the heart of turnus flares for battle , warns him of what to trust in men ’ s affairs , concluding all with his own strong appeals
1	barely raising his eyes , palinurus answers : you tell me to forget my sense of the sea ? — the placid face of the swells , the sleeping breakers ?
1	and the fighters split apart and then closed ranks , marshaled in five battalions , captains leading each
1	just let aeneas—if he needs us so , and presses so to join in alliance and take the name of comrade— come in person and never shy from the eyes of friends
1	but you , menelaus o my king , you had no heart to defend the pylians , hard-pressed as they were , once their leader left , a heavy blow to his troops
1	strangers will mark his lands off , stealing his estates
1	since then , turnus , you see what assaults , what crises dog my steps , what labors you have shouldered , you , first of all
1	tyrian dido marveled , first at the sight of him , next at all he ’ d suffered , then she said aloud : born of a goddess , even so what destiny hunts you down through such ordeals ?
1	altars plundered for torches , down from menacing clouds a torrent of spears , and the iron rain pelts thick-and-fast as they carry off the holy bowls and sacred braziers
1	— so concerned that his team and car were wrecked , and the fellow too , for all his racing skills
1	they chafe , sitting in camp , so bent on battle now the kings of achaea can not hold them back
1	you would never think so many troops could march holding their voices in their chests , all silence , fearing their chiefs who called out clear commands , and the burnished blazoned armor round their bodies flared , the formations trampling on
1	and the famous crippled smith replied , courage !
1	the average driver , leaving all to team and car , recklessly makes his turn , veering left and right , his pair swerving over the course — he ca not control them
1	starting with dardanus , storm-king zeus 's son who founded dardania , long before holy troy arose , that city reared on the plain to shelter all our people
1	but now pour cups to jove and call on father anchises with our prayers , set out the wine on tables once again !
1	a new day ’ s dawn was moving over the earth , aurora ’ s torch cleansing the sky , burning away the dank shade of night as the restless queen , beside herself , confides now to the sister of her soul : dear anna , the dreams that haunt my quaking heart !
1	embracing me as i left that day , he sent me out to win ourselves an empire—fearful , warning that we would face brave men , a battle-hardened people
1	not with envoys or artful diplomatic probes , i come in person , put my life on the line , a suppliant at your doors to plead for help
1	away with you , girl , glittering little puppet !
1	i speed this word to you from storming zeus
1	for father , i fear — if he 's not dead and buried yet — just clings , perhaps , to his last breath of life , ground down now by the hateful siege of years , waiting , day after day , for painful news of me — until he learns his only son is dead
1	not even helenus , filled with dreadful warnings , foresaw such grief for me—not even foul celaeno
1	he treats them kindly and adds these gracious words : what unmerited stroke of fortune , men of latium , traps you so in war that you flee from us , your friends ?
1	everywhere lie the motionless bodies of the dead , strewn in her streets , her homes and the gods ’ shrines we held in awe
1	leave the fighting to men
1	before then , for me at least , neither food nor drink will travel down my throat , not with my friend dead , there in my shelter , torn to shreds by the sharp bronze
1	even furious juno , now plaguing the land and sea and sky with terror : she will mend her ways and hold dear with me these romans , lords of the earth , the race arrayed in togas
1	i fear they will pay us back for yesterday 's triumph
1	vengeance waits , the same fate watches over you too , you ’ ll lie here in the same field—very soon
1	and once they reached the fertile land of troy they all streamed ashore , row on row in a long cortege , the sea-nymphs filing up where the myrmidon ships lay hauled , clustered closely round the great runner achilles
1	or does fortune shine again on you , hector ’ s andromache , just as you deserve ?
1	aeneas puts in here with a bare seven warships saved from his whole fleet
1	harder to save the warships once they are up in flames
1	now there was a man , that tydeus , that aetolian
1	in a flash aeneas , overjoyed now at the sight of the tuscan ’ s blood , sweeps his sword from its sheath and closes fast on his staggered foe
1	he would extend to you if you will end your anger
1	well , nine days we should mourn him in our halls , on the tenth we would bury hector , hold the public feast , on the eleventh build the barrow high above his body — on the twelfth we would fight again
1	some shut the gates , not daring to clear a safe way in for comrades , beg as they will , and a ghastly bloodbath follows , defenders killed at the entries , enemies flung on swords
1	— or check his rage and beat his fury down ?
1	wo not you listen to reason ?
1	she smiled with her lips only , her forehead furrowed over her dark brows as her anguish rose and she addressed them all : what fools we are , storming against zeus — we are mad !
1	he dispelled the mist at once , drove off the cloud and the sun came blazing forth and the whole war swung into view , clear , that instant — and ajax called the lord of the war cry , menelaus : look hard for antilochus now , my royal friend
1	i have never seen or heard tell of a single man wreaking so much havoc in one day as hector , zeus 's favorite , wreaks against our troops , and all on his own — no son of god or goddess
1	their thick armored walls no longer can shield the trojans
1	there was a trojan , dares , a decent , wealthy man , the god hephaestus ' priest who had bred two sons , phegeus and idaeus , trained for every foray
1	how they would exult , priam and priam 's sons and all the trojans
1	fighting against achilles ' overwhelming fury !
1	when they came to his shepherd 's fold he favored love who dangled before his eyes the lust that loosed disaster
1	pity the ones whose sons stand up to me in war !
1	better for you to take this wretched life— by any death you please
1	but the swift runner achilles answered him at once , just how , agamemnon , great field marshal
1	and old phoenix first — zeus loves the man , so let him lead the way
1	look , the achaean champion 's badly wounded — i shot him down , i swear he wo not last long — if the archer really sped me here from lycia !
1	and i with my spear
1	fling them at others , do not give me commands !
1	when dread has left my bones , i bring this omen sent by the gods before our chosen trojan captains , my father first of all : i had to have their judgment
1	— who are your parents ?
1	whatever you choose , great hesperia—saturn ’ s fields— or the shores of eryx with acestes as your king , i will provide safe passage , escorts and support to speed you on your way
1	mad—while through the woods and deserted lairs of wild beasts allecto whips amata on with the lash that whips her maenads
1	but the pilot answered : captain , anchises ’ son , apollo ’ s prophetic cauldron has not failed you— no god drowned me in open waters
1	you would be the first to lash out at another — anywhere — you saw hanging back from this , this hateful war
1	you never neglected me in life , only now in death
1	killing is no crime
1	pushing epeans north on the spreading plain we went , killing their troops , gathering up their burnished gear , far as buprasion rich in wheat our chariots rolled , all the way to olenian rock and the high ground they call alesion hill — but there , at last , pallas athena turned our forces back
1	so ajax and odysseus made their way at once where the battle lines of breakers crash and drag , praying hard to the god who moves and shakes the earth that they might bring the proud heart of achilles round with speed and ease
1	then they slash the throats of the hallowed victims over the flames , and tear their pulsing entrails out and heap the altars high with groaning platters
1	grasping my hand she held me back , adding this from her rose-red lips : my son , what grief could incite such blazing anger ?
1	i beg you , father , give them back their xanthus and their simois if these luckless trojans must , once more , relive the fall of troy !
1	zeus never dreamed in his heart a single deathless god would go to war for troy 's or achaea 's forces now
1	here is caesar and all the line of iulus soon to venture under the sky ’ s great arch
1	true , just like agenor head to foot the deadly archer stood in achilles ' path and achilles sprang in chase , feet racing , coursing him far across the wheat-fields , heading him out toward scamander 's whirling depths as the god led him a little , luring him on and on — always hoping to catch the god with bursts of speed
1	never doubt your powers
1	at that a crowd volunteered to go with diomedes
1	then let me die at once — achilles burst out , despairing — since it was not my fate to save my dearest comrade from his death !
1	stroke by stroke i swam for land , safety was in my grasp , weighed down by my sodden clothes , my fingers clawing the jutting spurs of a cliff , when a band of brutes came at me , ran me through with knives , the fools , they took me for plunder worth the taking
1	whatever fortune sends , it ’ s mine
1	saturn ’ s reign was the age of gold , men like to say , so peacefully , calm and kind , he ruled his subjects
1	with that , venus reached to embrace her son and set the brilliant armor down before him under a nearby oak
1	aeneas , ferocious in armor , stood there , still , shifting his gaze , and held his sword-arm back , holding himself back too as turnus ’ words began to sway him more and more
1	and reaching their prime they joined the argives sailing the black ships outward bound for the stallion-land of troy , all for the sons of atreus , to fight to the end and win their honor back — so death put an end to both , wrapped them both in night
1	fraud will never carry you home , safe and sound , to your lying father aunus !
1	and crouching down at his feet , quickly grasping his knees with her left hand , her right hand holding him underneath the chin , she prayed to the lord god zeus , the son of cronus : zeus , father zeus !
1	latinus had no son , his one male issue torn from him by the gods ’ decrees , in the first bloom of youth
1	but then , as soon as aeneas entered the high-built gates , they beat their breasts and raised their cries to the sky and the royal lodging groaned with wails of grief
1	all the italians fought to storm it , full strength , straining to drag it down , full force while trojans , jammed inside , fought to defend it , barricade it with stones , hurling salvos of spears through gaping loopholes
1	but now scylla to starboard blocks your way , with never-sated charybdis off to port— three times a day , into the plunging whirlpool of her abyss she gulps down floods of sea , then heaves them back in the air , pelting the stars with spray
1	seven tripods never touched by fire , ten bars of gold , twenty burnished cauldrons , a dozen massive stallions , racers who earned me trophies with their speed
1	pouring cups to the gods , each warlord sought his shelter
1	he left them there for dead and just at the point where most battalions scattered agamemnon charged , the rest of his troops in armor quick behind him now , infantry killing infantry fleeing headlong , hard-pressed , drivers killing drivers — under the onrush dust in whirlwinds driven up from the plain , hoofs of stallions rumbling thunder , bronze flashing , immense slaughter and always king agamemnon whirling to kill , crying his argives on , breakneck on
1	once they had entered , allowed to appeal before the queen—the eldest , prince ilioneus , calm , composed , spoke out : your majesty , empowered by jove to found your new city here and curb rebellious tribes with your sense of justice—we poor trojans , castaways , tossed by storms over all the seas , we beg you : keep the cursed fire off our ships !
1	so the old king vowed — but you have destroyed his hopes
1	but the two launched out in flight and reaching ida with all her springs , mother of flocks , they found the thundering son of cronus seated high on gargaron peak , crowned with a fragrant cloud
1	you argives , you degraded — splendid in battle dress , pure sham !
1	dress his body in deathless , ambrosial robes
1	and you , the captain of craft and cunning , shrewd with greed !
1	that first , then seize the indestructible shield the god of fire gave you , ringed with gold
1	but zeus is with us here !
1	the whole world quaked , the slopes of ida with all her springs and all her peaks and the walls of troy and all achaea 's ships
1	out in the lead , pyrrhus seizes a double-axe and batters the rocky sill and ripping the bronze posts out of their sockets , hacking the rugged oaken planks of the doors , makes a breach , a gaping maw , and there , exposed , the heart of the house , the sweep of the colonnades , the palace depths of the old kings and priam lie exposed and they see the armed sentries bracing at the portals
1	not a thought for the many times i saved his son heracles , worked to death by the labors of eurystheus
1	but soon as achilles mustered all battalions , positioned in battle-order led by captains , he imposed this stern command on all his troops : myrmidons !
1	the men looked on in horror
1	ah , but to leave no hoofmarks pointing forward , into his cave he dragged them by the tail , turning their tracks backward— the pirate hid his plunder deep in his dark rocks
1	from there , headlong down with his full weight he plunged to the sea as a seahawk skims the waves , rounding the beaches , rounding cliffs to hunt for fish inshore
1	the white-armed goddess hera gave him voice : yes !
1	it ’ s your king , who renounced our pact of friendship , choosing to trust to turnus ’ force of arms
1	from their union springs the human race and the wild beasts , the winged lives of birds and the wondrous monsters bred below the glistening surface of the sea
1	but all the while the skies keep wheeling on and night comes sweeping in from the ocean stream , in its mammoth shadow swallowing up the earth , and the pole star , and the treachery of the greeks
1	ah would to god not one of them could escape his sudden plunging death beneath our hands !
1	that was nothing to how i hunger for you now — irresistible longing lays me low !
1	thousands , aeneas , and i will put you in command
1	listen to me , quickly !
1	so , two as they were , they slaughtered all her children
1	they armed for a raid , hoping to break the siege — loving wives and innocent children standing guard on the ramparts , flanked by elders bent with age as men marched out to war
1	agamemnon 's cry went piercing through the army : shame !
1	you were bent on trouble , whipping a howling killer-squall across the sea , bearing heracles off to the crowded town of cos , far from all his friends
1	then devoted aeneas , sword drawn , prays : now let the sun bear witness here and this , this land of italy that i call
1	then father anchises , stretching his hands toward the sea , cries out to the great powers , pledging them their due rites : gods , ward off these threats
1	but while the beaters scramble to ring the glens with nets , i ’ ll shower down a cloudburst , hail , black driving rain— i ’ ll shatter the vaulting sky with claps of thunder
1	at a stroke they all pitched into the work , dividing the labors , share and share alike , and bronze is running in rivers and flesh-tearing steel and gold ore melting down in the giant furnace
1	then as she breathes her last , she calls to acca , alone of her young comrades , more than all the others true to camilla , the only one with whom she shares her cares , and here is what she says : this far , acca , my sister , and i can go no further
1	so the wrath of the gods declares , the fresh-dug graves before latinus ’ eyes
1	and on he goes , cloaked in cloud—remarkable—right in their midst he blends in with the crowds , and no one sees him
1	the dawn was a red glow now , putting stars to flight as we glimpse the low-lying hills , dim in the distance
1	now caeculus , vulcan ’ s stock , and umbro fresh from the marsian highlands rally their troops as aeneas rages on against them
1	book twenty : olympian gods in arms
1	that fired their hearts with the fury of despair
1	and under a foaming wave her sisters dove as glistening-footed thetis soared toward olympus to win her dear son an immortal set of arms
1	there he writhed in pain but soon , encamped by the ships , the argives would recall philoctetes , their great king
1	i do not blame you
1	brutal jupiter hands it all over to greece , greeks are lording over our city up in flames
1	he was hector 's close comrade , born on the same night , but excelled at trading words as he at trading spear-thrusts
1	and i will surge on ahead , clearing the whole way for the teams ' assault — i will bend the argives back !
1	then back to my house i go—if only , only she ’ s gone there— but the greeks have flooded in , seized the entire place
1	well , there 's one , i trust , who will never yield to him !
1	but again i try , i tear at another stubborn stalk— i ’ ll probe this mystery to its hidden roots , and again the dark blood runs from the torn bark
1	and shipmates race each other , thrashing the waves , plunging along phaeacia ’ s mist-enshrouded heights to lose them far astern , skirting epirus ’ coasts , sailing into chaonia ’ s port and we finally reach the hilltop town , buthrotum
1	nor could i pass you by , cunarus , staunchest in war of all liguria ’ s chiefs , or you with your modest band of men , cupavo
1	this is more than i can bear , i tell you — to watch my son do battle with menelaus loved by the war-god , right before my eyes
1	he only spurned them , groaning , i beg you — if any comrade will hear me out in this — stop pressing me now to glut myself with food and drink , now such painful grief has come and struck my heart !
1	bronze the threshold crowning a flight of stairs , the doorposts sheathed in bronze , and the bronze doors groaned deep on their hinges
1	which way did she go ?
1	but odysseus , cool tactician , tried to calm him : achilles , son of peleus , greatest of the achaeans , greater than i , stronger with spears by no small edge — yet i might just surpass you in seasoned judgment by quite a lot , since i have years on you and i know the world much better
1	that 's what i propose
1	nothing to lift all spirits alike , i warn you
1	and the swift runner achilles answered warmly , ajax , royal son of telamon , captain of armies , all well said , after my own heart , or mostly so
1	the labor of battle would not let them , more labor urged by the god of the silver bow and man-destroying ares and strife flaring on , headlong on
1	and zeus let loose a huge crash of thunder from ida , hurling his bolts in a flash against achaea 's armies
1	you will hang your head if under the walls of troy the dogs in all their frenzy drag and maul the proud achilles ' steadfast friend
1	we are the closest to the dead , we will see to all things here
1	if you are going off to die , she begged , then take us with you too , to face the worst together
1	whipped with fear by their master 's threats they put on a fresh burst for a length or two but suddenly brave antilochus saw the narrow place where the road washed out — a sharp dip in the land where massing winter rains broke off the edge , making it all one sunken rut
1	but riding on with hector cebriones saw the trojan rout and shouted , hector !
1	i am not such a raw recruit , i like to think , born and bred on salamis
1	that ’ s the path to the stars— son of the gods , you ’ ll father gods to come !
1	and a hardy trojan would call on his side , friends !
1	or would you refuse me , always fuming against me because i defend the argives , you the trojans ?
1	the meeting grounds shook
1	with a wrenching groan you answered your friend , patroclus o my rider : achilles , son of peleus , greatest of the achaeans , spare me your anger , please — such heavy blows have overwhelmed the troops
1	no time for debate , and no dissent from acestes
1	in tears they gathered their gentle comrade 's white bones , all in a golden urn , sealed with a double fold of fat , and stowed the urn in his shelter , covered well with a light linen shroud , then laid his barrow out
1	i ’ m still stalked by the sight of terrifying omens
1	but all of a sudden , watch , with a ghastly swoop from the hills the harpies swarm us— ruffling , clattering wingbeats—ripping our food to bits , polluting it all with their foul , corrupting claws , their obscene shrieks bursting from the stench
1	wait — do not fling yourself in the grind of battle yet , not till you see me coming back with your own eyes
1	do not let me hear you boast in father 's halls , ever again , as you bragged among the gods till now , that you would fight poseidon strength for strength
1	we once had a king , aeneas
1	book ten : marauding through the night
1	grant us a sign , father , flow into our hearts !
1	and all the while aeneas calls on turnus to fight but the man is gone , so the many men who block his way he sends to death as juno ’ s winds are spinning turnus around in mid-sea and glancing backward , knowing nothing , no thanks for escape , he lifts his hands in prayer , his voice to the stars : almighty father , so , you find my guilt so great ?
1	the road won ’ t play us false
1	here was a man not sweet at heart , not kind , no , he was raging , wild — as tros grasped his knees , desperate , begging , achilles slit open his liver , the liver spurted loose , gushing with dark blood , drenched his lap and the night swirled down his eyes as his life breath slipped away
1	with that challenge he sprang from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground
1	his urgings fuel their fire : our situation is clear for all to see , and it needs no voice of ours in council now , my noble king
1	the last thing i would urge is to throw ourselves into battle
1	wildly as two winter torrents raging down from the mountains , swirling into a valley , hurl their great waters together , flash floods from the wellsprings plunging down in a gorge and miles away in the hills a shepherd hears the thunder — so from the grinding armies broke the cries and crash of war
1	let me clasp your hand , my father , let me— i beg you , don ’ t withdraw from my embrace !
1	the world went black as night before her eyes , she fainted , falling backward , gasping away her life breath
1	but they , as soon as the battlefield lay clear and level , charge at speed , rifling their spears at long range , then rush to battle with shields and clanging bronze
1	deadly going — then and there the trojans might have been rolled back , far away from the ships and tents to wind-torn troy if polydamas had not rushed to headstrong hector : impossible man !
1	but then — enraged for patroclus — brilliant achilles will bring prince hector down
1	like some lion that spots from his high lookout , far off on the plain and flexing for combat there , an immense bull , and the lion plunges toward his kill— and that is the image of turnus coming on for battle
1	true , unless my parents taught me to read the flight of birds for nothing
1	the opposing trojans fling down missiles , any and all , thrusting off the assault with rugged pikes—expert from their years of war at defending city ramparts
1	as long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger , the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
1	at once each struck his stance , up on his toes , fists raised high—not a twinge of fear now— heads rearing back , out of range of the fists , they mix punches , left , right , probe for openings , dares trusting to young blood and fancy footwork , entellus to brawn , to brute force , but his knees quake , his huge , lumbering frame is racked with labored breathing
1	then when the same chiefs had set aside their strife , they stood in full armor before jove ’ s holy altar , lifting cups , and slaughtered a sow to bind their pacts
1	he said no more
1	there great joy and a kingdom are yours to claim , and a queen to make your wife
1	and on he strode amidst his illustrious trojan allies — calling out with wild cries , now flashing before them all in the gleaming battle-gear of greathearted achilles
1	sick for their friend but what could they do ?
1	dearest to me of all my husband 's brothers — my husband , paris , magnificent as a god
1	and the one who proves the better man and wins , he will take those treasures fairly , lead the woman home
1	nor will aeneas ’ trojans ever revert in times to come , take up arms again and threaten to put this kingdom to the sword
1	down the plain he stormed like a stream in spate , a routing winter torrent sweeping away the dikes : the tight , piled dikes ca not hold it back any longer , banks shoring the blooming vineyards can not curb its course — a flash flood bursts as the rains from zeus pour down their power , acre on acre the well-dug work of farmers crumbling under it — so under tydides ' force the trojan columns panicked now , no standing their ground , massed , packed as they were
1	but tydeus treated them all to a shameful fate , finished them all but let one run for home , heeding the gods ' signs he let the hunter off
1	how willing you were !
1	latinus ’ urgings deflect the fury of turnus not one bit—it only surges higher
1	he was washed up on my shores , helpless , and i , i took him in , like a maniac let him share my kingdom , salvaged his lost fleet , plucked his crews from death
1	anchises ’ son came to a halt and stood there , pondering long , while pity filled his heart , their lot so hard , unjust
1	with that , he stirs the sentries and up they march to take their turn on watch
1	so the men fought on like a mass of whirling fire as swift antilochus raced the message toward achilles
1	even now the caspian and maeotic kingdoms quake at his coming , oracles sound the alarm and the seven mouths of the nile churn with fear
1	we can have no idea , no clear idea at all how the long campaign will end
1	all in battle-order drive them past patroclus — a cortege will mourn the man with teams and chariots
1	but now at last , stop , achilles — let your heart-devouring anger go !
1	but the will of zeus will always overpower the will of men , zeus who strikes fear in even the bravest man of war and tears away his triumph , all in a lightning flash , and at other times he will spur a man to battle
1	flies at him , looming over him , high in the saddle to strike him dead with his rugged beamy lance , the king begging for mercy , messapus shouting : this one ’ s finished !
1	but he wo not save you now , i would say — though the hope goes racing through your mind
1	it 's your own command still ringing in my ears , forbidding me to fight the immortals head-on , all but one of the blessed gods , that is — if aphrodite daughter of zeus slips into battle , she 's the one to stab with my sharp bronze spear
1	trusting so to your lofty birth ?
1	your father , remember , was no man of mercy
1	bow to my appeals
1	achilles never treated his enemy priam so
1	vast treasures are piled up in antimachus ' house , bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron — father would give you anything , gladly , priceless ransom if only he learns we are still alive in argive ships !
1	how can you sleep all night , a man weighed down with duties ?
1	yet even if other teams are faster , look at their drivers : there 's not a trick in their whips that you do not have at hand
1	torn in spirit , dido will not dissolve into sleep—her eyes , her mind won ’ t yield tonight
1	let this mission challenge all our children
1	still , the immortals loved prince hector dearly , best of all the mortals born in troy
1	they rushed to obey him , some swarming over the top at once , others streaming in through the sturdy gateways — argives scattering back in terror , back by the hollow hulls , the uproar rising , no way out , no end —
1	gladly , the rite performed , i unfold the whole event to anchises , point by point
1	a snake , and his back streaked red with blood , a thing of terror !
1	drivers , rein your horses hard by the trench — the men themselves , armed for assault on foot , we all follow hector , all in a mass attack
1	and the joint of his left shoulder ached with labor , forever bracing his huge burnished shield rock-steady , but they could not wrench it loose from round his body for all their pelting weapons
1	pitch himself at the swords and die at once ?
1	and deep within its walls were fifty sleeping chambers masoned in smooth , lustrous ashlar , linked in a line where the sons of priam slept beside their wedded wives , and facing these , opening out across the inner courtyard , lay the twelve sleeping chambers of priam 's daughters , masoned and roofed in lustrous ashlar , linked in a line where the sons-in-law of priam slept beside their wives
1	a prize to match the exploit !
1	but the gods forbid you to take creusa with you , bound from troy together
1	what age has been so blest to give you birth ?
1	but no gall in achilles
1	and the sea heaved in joy , cleaving a path for him and the team flew on in a blurring burst of speed , the bronze axle under the war-car never flecked with foam , the stallions vaulting , speeding poseidon toward achaea 's fleet
1	from now on , dido cares no more for appearances , nor for her reputation , either
1	he has more power than you , by far , but give him sound advice , guide him , even in battle
1	but hades made his way to craggy olympus , climbed to the house of zeus , stabbed with agony , grief-struck to the heart , the shaft driven into his massive shoulder grinding down his spirit
1	try hard , do better this time — bring your charioteer back home alive to his waiting argive comrades once we are through with fighting
1	who can stand against you ?
1	but soon as tydides followed up his spear , tracking its flight far down along the front where it stuck in sand , hector caught his breath and boarding his car , drove for his own main force as he hurtled clear of the dark fates of death — diomedes shouting after him , shaking his spear , now , again , you have escaped your death , you dog , but a good close brush with death it was , i would say !
1	under the sodden beams the tow still smolders , reeking a slow , heavy smoke that creeps along the keels , the ruin eating into the hulls , and all their heroic efforts , showering water , get them nowhere
1	where will you drive me next ?
1	the final hours of troy silence
1	ulysses would not tolerate such an outrage , always true to himself when it ’ s life-or-death
1	and there at the palace hector 's mother met her son , that warm , goodhearted woman , going in with laodice , the loveliest daughter hecuba ever bred
1	we press him : tell us where you were born , your family
1	but nothing could make him panic — no green boy , he stood his ground like a wild mountain boar , trusting his strength , standing up to a rout of men that scream and swoop against him off in a lonely copse , the ridge of his back bristling , his eyes flashing fire , he grinds his teeth , champing to beat back dogs and men
1	both were gods of the same line , a single father , but zeus was the elder-born and zeus knew more
1	the almighty father hurled his bolt through the thunderheads— no torches for him , no smoky flicker of pitch-pines , no , he spun him headlong down in a raging whirlwind
1	but achaea 's armies came on strong in silence , breathing combat-fury , hearts ablaze to defend each other to the death
1	his feet turned to the door , stretched out for burial , round him comrades mourning
1	aeneas grips it at once—the bough holds back— he tears it off in his zeal and bears it into the vatic sibyl ’ s shrine
1	i have an age-old tract along the tiber river , stretching west , beyond the sicanian border
1	but if victory grants our force-in-arms the day , as i think she may—may the gods decree it so— i shall not command italians to bow to trojans , nor do i seek the scepter for myself
1	range the achaean ranks , with your winning words hold back each man you find — do not let them haul their rolling ships to sea !
1	and i am aeneas , and i can boast anchises ' blood , the proud anchises , but my mother is aphrodite
1	the channels of all those rivers — apollo swung them round into one mouth and nine days hurled their flood against the wall and zeus came raining down , cloudburst powering cloudburst , the faster to wash that rampart out to open sea
1	too well i know how my people ’ s savage hatred swirls around me
1	as diomedes was stripping strong agastrophus bare , tearing the burnished breastplate off his victim 's chest , the shield from his shoulders and heavy crested helmet , paris , clenching the grip and drawing back his bow , shot !
1	dismiss your grief and fear
1	but high in his stronghold aeolus wields his scepter , soothing their passions , tempering their fury
1	did hector never burn in your honor thighs of oxen and flawless , full-grown goats ?
1	— or the death of my dear son , reared for me in scyros , if prince neoptolemus is still among the living
1	at least in death i ’ ll find a peaceful haven
1	lusting to lure me to my ruin yet again ?
1	no truce till one or the other falls and gluts with blood ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield
1	mnestheus , fierce serestus , both come rushing in and seeing their ranks in panic , ranks of enemies lodged inside the gates , mnestheus shouts out : where are you heading ?
1	curse to your father , your city and all your people , a joy to our enemies , rank disgrace to yourself !
1	ah to a cruel fate i bore you in our halls !
1	my dear comrade 's dead — patroclus — the man i loved beyond all other comrades , loved as my own life — i have lost him — hector 's killed him , stripped the gigantic armor off his back , a marvel to behold — my burnished gear !
1	all the argives flying home to their fatherland , sailing over the sea 's broad back ?
1	please , help me to bathe her wounds in water now , and if any last , lingering breath still hovers , let me catch it on my lips
1	as he thought it out , the first way seemed the best
1	come , listen well to another man
1	nine years i lived with both , forging bronze by the trove , elegant brooches , whorled pins , necklaces , chokers , chains — there in the vaulted cave — and round us ocean 's currents swirled in a foaming , roaring rush that never died
1	and now you threaten to strip me of my prize in person — the one i fought for long and hard , and sons of achaea handed her to me
1	we live in shady groves , we settle on pillowed banks and meadows washed with brooks
1	let 's wake others also , diomedes famed for his spear , odysseus , quick little ajax and phyleus ' brave son
1	now see to menelaus , achaea 's fighting captain
1	apollo hurled fear in their hearts and handed hector and all his trojans instant glory
1	he demands his team and arms at once , in a flash of pride he leaps up onto his chariot , tugging hard on the reins and races on and droves of the brave he hands to death and tumbles droves of the half-dead down to earth or crushes whole detachments under his wheels or seizing their lances , cuts down all who cut and run
1	a whole army of men arriving out of the same quarter , bent on the same goal , to rule our city ’ s heights !
1	how her golden brooch binds up her hair—how she cradles a lycian quiver , her shepherd ’ s staff of myrtle spiked with steel
1	a suppliant now , his fresh cheeks and his strong young body pallid
1	diomedes just drew back beside his car and team and stood there calling sthenelus , capaneus ' son : quick , sthenelus
1	first , tall hector with helmet flashing led the trojans — priam 's son and in his command by far the greatest , bravest army , divisions harnessed in armor , veterans bristling spears
1	but you , have you just come from the tall ships ?
1	if die i must , death at the hands of men will be a joy !
1	you report my message — since this is the privilege of senior chiefs — let them work out a better plan of action , use their imaginations now to save the ships and achaea 's armies pressed to their hollow hulls
1	if my heart had not been fixed , dead set against embracing another man in the bonds of marriage— ever since my first love deceived me , cheated me by his death—if i were not as sick as i am of the bridal bed and torch , this , perhaps , is my one lapse that might have brought me down
1	while juno harangued the gods with her appeals , all were murmuring low , assenting , dissenting
1	now you would better plan how to save your city , you alone and your native troopers born in troy
1	the trojans never did me damage , not in the least , they never stole my cattle or my horses , never in phthia where the rich soil breeds strong men did they lay waste my crops
1	so now not even seasoned aeneas ' heavy shaft could smash achilles ' shield : the gold blocked it , forged in the god 's gift
1	but we , we forged ahead , oblivious , blind , insane , we stationed the monster fraught with doom on the hallowed heights of troy
1	what new course do we set ?
1	furious , struggling to tear the broken arrowhead out , he insists they take the quickest way to heal him : cut the wound with a broadsword , open it wide , dig out the point where it ’ s bedded deep and put me back into action !
1	hera 's challenge — and goddess athena , her eyes afire , could not resist
1	he cries , you and your vicious crimes !
1	nor do the proud commands of jove escape me now , our great , warm-hearted jove
1	you are talking to argive men who know my record
1	first hecamede pushed a table up toward them , handsome , sanded smooth , with blue enamel legs , and on it she set a basket , braided in bronze with onions in it , a relish for the drink , and pale gold honey along with barley meal , the grain 's blessed yield
1	now guide us again , athena , guide us against that thracian camp and horses !
1	— still in my senses , true , but a harrowed , broken man marked out by doom — past the threshold of old age
1	a doddering wreck too spent to see the truth ?
1	and then the heart of poseidon quaked with anger — his own grandson brought down in the bloody charge
1	but , oh dear gods , what slaughter threatens the poor laurentine people !
1	so now , if any lycian troops will obey my orders , home we go — and headlong death can come and topple troy
1	too many falling , day after day — battalions !
1	i will grant achilles glory and so safeguard your awe and love of me for all the years to come
1	but if go you must , pray , at least , to the great god of the dark storm cloud , up there on ida , gazing down on the whole expanse of troy !
1	there-aeneas replied in kind and killed two argive captains , diodes ' two sons , orsilochus flanking crethon
1	the whole army ’ s on guard , tense along the walls
1	just look , one woman crushed by the craft of two gods !
1	it 's offensive — this is not the time
1	and he forged a king 's estate where harvesters labored , reaping the ripe grain , swinging their whetted scythes
1	a high decree of the father must not come to nothing — whatever he commands
1	his son is dead in battle , his dearest son , ascalaphus — does not invincible ares claim to be his father ?
1	until they are battling round your well-built gates ?
1	as pallas , evander , all of them rise before aeneas ’ eyes , the welcoming board that met him that first day , the right hands clasped in trust— and four sons of sulmo , fighters all , and the same number reared by ufens : aeneas takes them alive to offer pallas ’ shade and soak his flaming pyre with captive blood
1	then he seized the royal scepter of his fathers — its power can never die — and grasping it tightly off he strode to the ships of argives armed in bronze
1	he hacks polydorus down and commandeers the gold
1	the armies took their seats , marshaled into ranks
1	tychius made it for him , laboring long , the finest leather-smith by far : over in hyle where the master had his home he crafted that famous gleaming shield for ajax , layering seven welted hides of sturdy well-fed bulls and hammered an eighth layer of bronze to top it off
1	go to sleep now , full to your heart 's content with food and wine , a soldier 's strength and nerve
1	aeneas ’ ship ’ s in the lead , with phrygian lions fixed on her beak , mount ida looming aloft , a god-sent sign of home to trojan exiles
1	but let him go alone , no other trojan attend him , only a herald with him , a seasoned , older one who can drive the mules and smooth-running wagon and bring the hero 's body back to sacred troy , the man that brilliant achilles killed in battle
1	the father accepted the sacrifices , true , but doubled the weight of thankless , ruthless war
1	but the greek commanders and agamemnon ’ s troops in phalanx , spotting the hero and his armor glinting through the shadows— blinding panic grips them , some turn tail and run as they once ran back to the ships , some strain to raise a battle cry , a thin wisp of a cry that mocks their gaping jaws
1	think of it : paris and menelaus loved by ares go to fight it out with their rugged spears — all for you — and the man who wins that duel , you will be called his wife !
1	phoebus , masking his voice like priam 's son lycaon , like him to the life the son of zeus called out , captain of trojan councils — where have they gone , those threats you made in your cups before the kings ?
1	withdraw to your main lines and wait him there , out of the crash of battle
1	i too could battle the deathless gods with words — it 's hard with a spear , the gods are so much stronger
1	some message from phthia that you alone have heard ?
1	then he would never have finished last of all
1	suddenly paris hurled — his spear 's long shadow flew and the shaft hit menelaus ' round shield , full center — not pounding through , the brazen point bent back in the tough armor
1	but here mezentius comes , brandishing high his massive spear and storming on like a whirlwind down the plain , and enormous as orion marching in mid-sea , plowing a path through the deep swells , his shoulders rearing over the waves , or hauling down from a ridge the trunk of an age-old mountain ash , as he treads the ground he hides his head in clouds— so vast , mezentius marching on in gigantic armor
1	but hector , his helmet flashing , never flinched : do not think for a moment , achilles , son of peleus , you can frighten me with words like a child , a fool — i am an old hand myself at trading taunts and insults
1	you trojans who stole away my wedded wife and hoards of riches too — for no reason , none — my queen of the realm who hosted you with kindness
1	night comes rushing down , embracing the earth in its deep dark wings
1	why , just now she plucked him away , she saved his life when he thought his end had come
1	why do i shrink from my decision ?
1	back to its well-known home the wounded creature fled , struggled into its stall and groaning , bleeding , filling the long halls with cries of pain , it seemed to plead for help
1	but if zeus allows you to kill off all the trojans , drive them out of my depths at least , i ask you , out on the plain and do your butchery there
1	the tale ’ s not failed—as you imagine—to reach my ears
1	but first he called his ranking chiefs to council beside the ship of nestor , the warlord born in pylos
1	time and again my fiery spirit drove me to win a wife , a fine partner to please my heart , to enjoy with her the treasures my old father peleus piled high
1	no , i must return to the ocean 's running stream , the aethiopians ' land
1	no one here 's in the grip of bloodless fear , collapsing in cowardice , ducking the grim assault
1	our glory 's gone if we fall back now on the ships — let the black earth gape and take us all at once , here and now !
1	but topping all your gifts , i beg you , just one more
1	with that , with destiny made clear , he left him there on the spot and turning back to achilles quickly brushed away the mist from his eyes , the magic , godsent haze
1	come now , let 's both put up a tripod or a cauldron , wager which horses are really out in front and we will make atrides agamemnon our referee — you will learn , do not worry , once you pay the price !
1	towering cliffs fling out their arms like steep twin walls and the temple rests securely back from shore
1	there lies our true home
1	then he eases his friends ’ and anxious iulus ’ fears , explaining the ways of fate , commanding envoys now to return his firm reply to king latinus , state the terms of peace
1	he , like a headland jutting into the ocean wastes and bared to the winds ’ rage , braving the breakers , weathering out all force and fury of sea and sky , stands firm himself
1	but achilles kept on grieving for his friend , the memory burning on
1	and now from all sides an enormous uproar , cries in conflict lift on the winds— like cries of bird-flocks landing in some tall grove by chance or swans with their hoarse calls clamoring out across the sounding pools of padusa river stocked with fish
1	his place , eastwind , is the rough rocks where you are all at home
1	and suddenly as they flew , the amasenus overflowed , look , foaming over its banks , such violent cloudbursts broke
1	nor do her trojan comrades tarry
1	so , he sought out italy under the fates ’ command ?
1	androgeos leading a horde of troops and taking us for allies on the march , the fool , he even gives us a warm salute and calls out : hurry up , men
1	haunting the fighting , are you ?
1	overawed by the king 's majestic scorn
1	at the first charge he slashed his right nipple , clean through the shoulder went the brazen point and down in the dust he fell like a lithe black poplar shot up tall and strong in the spreading marshy flats , the trunk trimmed but its head a shock of branches
1	the earth groans as stroke after stroke they land with naked swords : fortune and fortitude mix in one assault
1	go back to him , mother , stroke the father with soft , winning words — at once the olympian will turn kind to us again
1	achilles next , he leapt at prince agenor — but phoebus refused to let him seize the glory — he whisked agenor off , wrapped in swirls of mist and sped him out of the fighting safely on his way and then with trickery kept achilles off the trojans
1	athena 's own hand deflected it down the belt where the gold buckles clasp and breastplates overlap
1	around him , heaps of dead , and among them old galaesus killed as he set himself in their midst to beg for peace , the most righteous man in all the italian fields , long ago , the richest too
1	never set foot again on mount olympus , never !
1	there was a secret door , a hidden passage linking the wings of priam ’ s house—remote , far to the rear
1	have not you got enough to wail about at home without coming here to add to all my griefs ?
1	but once he would passed it round and reached the man who had scratched the stone and thrown it in the helmet — ajax bent on glory — out went his hand to take it , the herald pausing beside him dropped it in and ajax knew his mark and thrilled to see it , flung it down at his feet and shouted , friends — the lot is mine and it fills my heart with joy !
1	nothing , no reply , and again creusa !
1	but the skin of the brave soldier never blanches
1	who drove from the ships such raging fire ?
1	they never thought they would fight free of death
1	cupid leaps at once to his loving mother ’ s orders
1	next turnus buckles round his shoulders the breastplate , dense with its golden mesh and livid mountain bronze , and straps on sword , shield , and helmet with horns for its bloody crest—that sword the fire-god forged for father daunus , plunged red-hot in the river styx
1	and the same anguish shook menelaus too — no sleep could settle over his eyes , not now
1	sing to me now , you muses who hold the halls of olympus !
1	at that , priam , trapped in the grip of death , not holding back , not checking his words , his rage : you !
1	i am on my way over there to meet this new assault — i will soon be back , once i have helped our friends
1	stepping back from the pyre he prayed to the two winds — zephyr and boreas , west and north — promised splendid victims and pouring generous , brimming cups from a golden goblet , begged them to come , so the wood might burst in flame and the dead burn down to ash with all good speed
1	do not bow to a soldier 's rank , an eye to his birth — even if he 's more kingly
1	and now as trojan aeneas , gazing in awe at all the scenes of troy , stood there , spellbound , eyes fixed on the war alone , the queen aglow with beauty approached the temple , dido , with massed escorts marching in her wake
1	no trojans could save him now , strain as they might — ajax son of telamon charging quickly into the carnage speared him at close range through the bronze-cheeked helmet , the horsehair crest cracked wide open around the point , smashed by the massive spear and hand that drove it
1	and king agamemnon , thrilled to see that sight , sped them on with a rousing flight of praises : ajax — ajax !
1	into the center lines juturna strides , alert to the work at hand , and she sows a variety of rumors , urging : aren ’ t you ashamed , rutulians , putting at risk the life of one to save us all ?
1	no nation on earth will match the honors they shower down on you
1	her voice rang out in tears and vast throngs wailed and old king priam rose and gave his people orders : now , you men of troy , haul timber into the city !
1	i will go after pallas , pallas is mine now , my prize alone
1	so the heart inside your chest is never daunted
1	quickly the long-haired achaeans took their meal throughout the shelters , then they armed at once
1	the rousing rumor of war had carried far as cyprus — how the achaean ships were launching war on troy — so he gave the king that gear to please his spirit
1	so he cried and his outcry stirred in them all a deep desire to grieve , and dawn with her rose-red fingers shone upon them weeping round the wretched corpse
1	i wish i were as surely the son of storming zeus for all my days — and noble hera gave me birth and i were prized as they prize athena and apollo — as surely as this day will bring your argives death , down to the last man
1	the more he gloried , the more grief swept the argives , brave antilochus most , his battle-passion rising , stunned with pain but he would not fail hypsenor
1	but crowding round her now her husband 's sisters and brothers ' wives supported her in their midst , and she , terrified , stunned to the point of death , struggling for breath now and coming back to life , burst out in grief among the trojan women : o hector — i am destroyed !
1	and the noble son of anchises led the dardanians — aeneas whom the radiant aphrodite bore anchises down the folds of ida , a goddess bedded with a man
1	that ’ s all he says
1	i will go with you , your comrade
1	rushing back to the palace turnus calls for his team and thrills to see them neighing right before him , gifts from orithyia herself to glorify pilumnus , horses whiter than snow , swifter than racing winds
1	so he decreed and thetis with her glistening feet did not resist a moment
1	there you have my lineage
1	and roan beauty the horse with flashing hoofs spoke up from under the yoke , bowing his head low so his full mane came streaming down the yoke-pads , down along the yoke to sweep the ground
1	and now the giant fighter would summon up his fury , wheeling on them again , beating off platoons of the stallion-breaking trojans — and now again he would swerve around in flight
1	dodging the big spear , aeneas got to his feet
1	even achilles dreads to pit himself against him out on the battle lines where men win glory — achilles , far and away a stronger man than you
1	and the giant ajax got to his feet at once , odysseus stood up too , an expert at every subtle , cunning hold
1	as for the gifts , let the king of men agamemnon have the lot of them hauled amidst our muster , so all the troops can see the trove themselves and you , achilles , you can warm your heart
1	now we are swept away , iphitus , pelias with me , one weighed down with age and the other slowed by a wound ulysses gave him—heading straight for priam ’ s palace , driven there by the outcries
1	— is this the man who mustered the oarsmen once , who braved the seas in his racing deep-sea ships , trafficked with outlanders , carried off a woman far from her distant shores , a great beauty wed to a land of rugged spearmen ?
1	even if twenty hectors had charged against me — they would all have died here , laid low by my spear
1	the great blockade is over
1	but again , still bent on glory , hector mustered his trojan cohorts , pulled them back from the ships toward the river rapids , to wide open ground where they found a sector free and clear of corpses
1	but zeus drew hector out of range of the weapons , out of the dust storm , out of the mounting kills , the blood and rout of war as atrides followed hard , shouting his argives on , furious , never stopping
1	agamemnon leapt to his feet and hurled his threat — his threat 's been driven home
1	a great curse olympian zeus let live and grow in him , for troy and high-hearted priam and all his sons
1	there the fire-god forged them , well aware of the seers and schooled in times to come , all in order the generations born of ascanius ’ stock and all the wars they waged
1	but no tears move aeneas now
1	and no god on high , none is to blame so much as my dear mother — how she lied , she beguiled me , she promised me i would die beneath the walls of the armored trojans , cut down in blood by apollo 's whipping arrows !
1	he mounted again and flogged the horses hard and on they flew to the ships , holding nothing back — that 's where their spirits drove them on to go
1	the next battalion was led by fighting eudorus , born out of wedlock too
1	and zeus the son of cronus bowed his craggy dark brows and the deathless locks came pouring down from the thunderhead of the great immortal king and giant shock waves spread through all olympus
1	but the distant deadly archer volleyed back , god of the earthquake — you would think me hardly sane if i fought with you for the sake of wretched mortals
1	their horses will never sweep them clear of us , not both men , though one or the other may escape
1	taunting so , and steadfast diomedes offered no reply
1	hector loosed a piercing cry at his men : drive , drive , my stallion-breaking trojans !
1	first he finishes abas , quick to face him there : that burly knot , that bulwark of battle
1	that was my first step on the slippery road to ruin
1	i will gladly swear your oath — the spirit moves me now — nor will i break that oath in the eyes of any god
1	diana ’ s her only passion
1	each man to his own best hope , but now you can see how slim your hopes have been
1	nestor the noble horseman led with questions : tell me , odysseus , achaea 's pride and glory , famous odysseus , how did you get these horses ?
1	but it brought no joy to the heart of agamemnon , our high and mighty king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears
1	but aeneas , the great commander , hearing the name of turnus , deserts the walls , deserts the citadel ’ s heights and breaks off all operations , jettisons all delay— he springs in joy , drums his shield and it thunders terror
1	and across the trench he drove the purebred team with a rough exultant laugh as comrades cheered , crowding in his wake
1	some spears that flew from the trojans ' hardy arms , hurtling forward , stuck fast in his huge shield but showers of others , cut short halfway before they could graze his gleaming skin , stuck in the ground , still lusting to sink in flesh
1	out with it now !
1	then and there he unstrapped his polished bow , the horn of a wild goat he would shot in the chest one day as the springy ibex clambered down a cliff
1	the racer in all his glory just stood there , clutching one of the beast 's horns , spitting out the dung and sputtering to his comrades , foul , by heaven !
1	a silver bowl , gorgeous , just six measures deep but the finest mixing bowl in all the world
1	no sooner said than , moving on , he points out the altar of carmentis , then the carmental gate as the romans call it : an ancient tribute paid to the nymph carmentis , seer who told the truth , the first to foresee the greatness of aeneas ’ sons and pallanteum ’ s fame to come
1	the fates will find the way
1	a hundred other maids and a hundred men , all matched in age , are spreading the feast on trestles , setting out the cups
1	now erichthonius sired tros , a lord of the trojans , and tros , in turn , had three distinguished sons : ilus , assaracus and ganymede radiant as a god , and he was the handsomest mortal man on earth — and so the immortals , awestruck by his beauty , snatched him away to bear the cup of zeus and pour out wine for all the deathless gods
1	but his sister artemis , huntress , queen of beasts , inveighed against him now with stinging insults : so , the deadly immortal archer runs for dear life !
1	while into the melee hurry lucagus and his brother liger , chariot-borne by two white steeds , the brother reinsman guiding the team as lucagus flaunts his naked steel
1	i am the greater king , i am the elder-born , i claim — the greater man
1	but packed in a mass the trojans came on pounding , hector leading the way with long , leaping strides and heading the van in person came the god apollo , shoulders wrapped in cloud , gripping the storm-shield , the tempest terror , dazzling , tassels flaring along its front — the bronzesmith god of fire gave it to zeus to bear and strike fear in men and apollo gripped it now , locked in his two fists as he led the trojans on
1	when men dread that , more men come through alive — when soldiers break and run , good-bye glory , good-bye all defenses !
1	and i hear his urgings ringing in my ears : 'always be the best , my boy , the bravest , and hold your head up high above the others
1	if only he would offer one last gift to the wretched queen who loves him : to wait for fair winds , smooth sailing for his flight !
1	this order still on his lips , apollo vanished from sight into empty air
1	and all ranks of achaeans cried out their assent : respect the priest , accept the shining ransom !
1	the harder he cried the harder his forces charged against the argives
1	we have not come to put your libyan gods and homes to the sword , loot them and haul our plunder toward the beach
1	apollo the archer , finding his birthplace drifting shore to shore , like a proper son had chained it fast to myconos ’ steep coast and gyaros , made it stable , a home for men that scorns the winds ’ assaults
1	she is the one who supports the trojan forces , not their own strong hands that clutch for combat , not their unflinching spirits seasoned hard to peril
1	the best by far of the teams were eumelus ' mares and pheres ' grandson drove them — swift as birds , matched in age and their glossy coats and matched to a builder 's level flat across their backs
1	explode in a burst of fire !
1	a flash of a lance — hector hurled at automedon who kept his eyes right on him , dodged the bronze , ducking down with a quick lunge , and behind his back the heavy spearshaft plunged and stuck in the earth , the butt end quivering into the air till suddenly rugged ares snuffed its fury out , dead still
1	march out on your mission , bravest chief of the trojans , now the italians too
1	all of them , all our best in the old campaigns are laid up in the hulls , they are hit by arrows , pierced by spears , brought down by trojan hands while the trojans ' power keeps on rising , rising !
1	he ’ s setting his own squadrons between their closing forces now
1	i am afraid he may be hurt , alone with the trojans , brave as odysseus is — a blow to all our troops
1	fight like men , my friends , call up your battle-fury — make for the hollow ships !
1	no fame , no memory to be won for punishing a woman : such victory reaps no praise but to stamp this abomination out as she deserves , to punish her now , they ’ ll sing my praise for that
1	the great mother pitied us , changed our shape , she made us goddesses , yes , and so we pass our lives beneath the waves
1	but king agamemnon answered him in haste , true , old man — all you say is fit and proper — but this soldier wants to tower over the armies , he wants to rule over all , to lord it over all , give out orders to every man in sight
1	quick as the wind the goddess had a plan : we know — we too — they hold your famous armor
1	that ’ s hardly the man that pandarus and bitias met when those two giants confronted me— and the thousand men whom i , in a single day , sent down to hell in all my triumph , trapped as i was inside the enemy ’ s rugged walls
1	i ’ ll explain in a word or so
1	seven tripods hauled from the tents , as promised , twenty burnished cauldrons , a dozen massive stallions
1	what do you want ?
1	zeus the son of almighty cronus , i remind you , bowed his head that day we boarded ship , all the argives laden with blood and death for troy — his lightning bolts on the right , good omens blazing forth
1	troy has fallen—and fallen let her stay— with the very name of troy !
1	hector seethed in anger — his hurtling spear and his whole arm 's power poured in a wasted shot — and back in his massing ranks he shrank , dodging death
1	step right up , just come this way—to die !
1	now i will tell you what seems best to me
1	for nine whole days the immortals have been feuding over hector 's corpse and achilles scourge of cities
1	following step by step the fighting menelaus strapped on armor too
1	the men of troy will erect a city for me— lavinia will give its walls her name
1	at once menestheus sped a herald to ajax : run for it , quick one , call great ajax here — both of them , better yet , that 's best of all
1	god of the earthquake , you with your massive power , why are you moaning so ?
1	all the worse for him — if achilles wants to venture forth from the fleet , fight us round our walls
1	later you can mourn your beloved son once more , when you bear him home to troy , and you will weep many tears
1	but my heart still heaves with rage whenever i call to mind that arrogance of his — how he mortified me , right in front of the argives — that son of atreus treating me like some vagabond , like some outcast stripped of all my rights !
1	no small voice in the public councils , always a shrewd adviser , a power in party strife
1	then in a blur of kills , amphoterus , erymas , epaltes , tlepolemus son of damastor , and echius and pyris , ipheus and euippus and polymelus the son of argeas — he crowded corpse on corpse on the earth that rears us all
1	just don ’ t commit your words to the rustling , scattering leaves— sport of the winds that whirl them all away
1	enraged at his friend 's death odysseus sprang in fury , helmed in fiery bronze he plowed through the front and charging the enemy , glaring left and right he hurled his spear — a glinting brazen streak — and the trojans gave ground , scattering back , panicking there before his whirling shaft — a direct hit !
1	and just coming in range , just closing on each other
1	whirling it round the fighter sent it flying into his argives scrambling fast to retrieve it — back at his man he sprang , enraged with brazen spear , mad for the kill but aphrodite snatched paris away , easy work for a god , wrapped him in swirls of mist and set him down in his bedroom filled with scent
1	as long as brilliant achilles stalked the front no trojan would ever venture beyond the dardan gates , they were so afraid of the man 's tremendous spear
1	so— so—i rejoice to make my way among the shades
1	just think , you are to die by the arrows of diana !
1	so now , menelaus , the fresh blood went staining down your sturdy thighs , your shins and well-turned ankles
1	but destiny guided amphius on , a comrade sworn to the cause of priam and all of priam 's sons
1	but we , your own children , the ones you swore would hold the battlements of heaven—now our ships are lost , appalling !
1	that 's why a fighter prays for kin in his halls , blood kin to survive and avenge his death in battle !
1	ajax strode on , closing , bearing his huge body-shield like a rampart , heavy bronze over seven layers of oxhide
1	enough of your threats !
1	you say you ’ re achilles ’ son ?
1	while hector still lived and achilles raged on and the warlord priam 's citadel went unstormed , so long the achaeans ' rampart stood erect
1	but enter this man-killing war without the gifts — your fame will flag , no longer the same honor , even though you hurl the trojans home !
1	hector , tearing the famous armor off patroclus , tugged hard at the corpse , mad to hack the head from the neck with bronze and drag the trunk away to glut the dogs of troy
1	so the illustrious son of priam begged for life but only heard a merciless voice in answer : fool , do not talk to me of ransom
1	but now , look , brilliant achilles courses him round the city of priam in all his savage , lethal speed
1	here cretan rhadamanthus rules with an iron hand , censuring men , exposing fraud , forcing confessions when anyone up above , reveling in his hidden crimes , puts off his day of atonement till he dies , the fool , too late
1	but if you are on fire , overflowing with passion , there 's always your own bedroom
1	you are both younger than i , and in my time i struck up with better men than you , even you , but never once did they make light of me
1	perhaps — who knows ?
1	that 's just a gift of god
1	share and share alike the hoards our handsome citadel stores within its depths and — why debate , my friend ?
1	bear witness , altar and those infernal knives that i escaped and the sacred bands i wore myself : the victim
1	the people know , they admit they know what destiny has in store , but they flinch from speaking out
1	lost , i was leaving behind familiar paths , at a run down blind dead ends when— oh dear god , my wife , creusa— torn from me by a brutal fate !
1	wait , come , my guest , she urges , tell us your own story , start to finish—the ambush laid by the greeks , the pain your people suffered , the wanderings you have faced
1	wretched women of troy , it ’ s not the enemy camp , the greeks—you ’ re burning your own best hopes !
1	with those words she had climbed the pyre ’ s topmost steps and now , clasping her dying sister to her breast , fondling her she sobbed , stanching the dark blood with her own gown
1	suddenly , misenus—out on the dry beach they see him , reach him now , cut off by a death all undeserved
1	watch : the virgin daughter of priam , cassandra , torn from the sacred depths of minerva ’ s shrine , dragged by the hair , raising her burning eyes to the heavens , just her eyes , so helpless , shackles kept her from raising her gentle hands
1	silvius , your son , your last-born , when late in your old age your wife lavinia brings him up , deep in the woods—a king who fathers kings in turn , he founds our race that rules in alba longa
1	they say the captain , rushing headlong on to harness his team and board his car to begin the duel , left his father ’ s sword behind and hastily grabbed his charioteer metiscus ’ blade
1	so now the heart of sarpedon stalwart as a god impelled him to charge the wall and break it down
1	arriving , he finds the queen already poised on a golden throne beneath the sumptuous hangings , commanding the very center of her palace
1	teucer , your enemy , often sang troy ’ s praises , claiming his own descent from teucer ’ s ancient stock
1	one mother bore them all , a tuscan , loyal tyrrhena wed to gylippus , her arcadian husband
1	so venus makes an appeal to love , her winged son : you , my son , are my strength , my greatest power— you alone , my son , can scoff at the lightning bolts the high and mighty father hurled against typhoeus
1	helmet flashing , hector wheeled with a dark glance : no more , polydamas !
1	have they entitled him to hurl abuse at me ?
1	with those bleak words queen hera took her seat
1	i myself will lead you between my banks , upstream , making your way against the current under oars— i ’ ll speed you on your journey
1	flinging cries as a screaming gust of the northwind pounds against his sail , raising waves sky-high
1	first , that italian land you think so near— all unknowing , planning to ease into its harbors— lies far off
1	and as for the gifts you bring me from your homeland , give them to aeneas
1	i heard a voice of the gods who live forever
1	and atrides led the way and ajax took his lead , striding on like a god until they found odysseus dear to zeus but round him trojans thronged like tawny jackals up in the mountains swarming round a horned stag just wounded — a hunter 's hit him with one fast shaft from his bow and the stag 's escaped , sprinting at top speed so long as his blood runs warm and the spring in his knees still lasts
1	what kings were fired for war , what armies at their orders thronged the plains ?
1	but you , thoas , you who were always rock-steady in battle and braced the ones you saw go slack and flinch — do not quit now , thoas , urge each man you find !
1	he was the one who brought me here to troy — oh how i wish i would died before that day !
1	look down then , if you have the taste for it , hera , and you will see the towering son of cronus killing still more hordes , whole armies of argive soldiers
1	helios , sun above us , you who see all , hear all things !
1	that said , the terrible goddess swooped down to the earth and stirred allecto , mother of sorrows , up from her den where nightmare furies lurk in hellish darkness
1	now one thing 's certain — your own headlong death !
1	never — even if zeus 's wrath does not strike home at once , he will strike in his own good time with greater fury
1	where to begin , what opening ?
1	but you do not press on and reach a useful end
1	now through troy the heralds brought the offerings for the gods , sacred victims to bind and seal the oaths : two lambs and the wine that warms the heart , the yield of the vine , filling a goatskin sack , and the herald idaeus carried a gleaming bowl and golden winecups
1	they found him with all his gear outside his shelter , cohorts sleeping round him , shields beneath their heads , spears stuck straight in the ground on butt-end spikes and the bronze points flashing into the distance like forked lightning flung by father zeus
1	the trojans slept on , strewn throughout their fortress , weary bodies embraced by slumber
1	he fell with a crash , his armor clanging round him
1	but the two of you , if only a god could make you stand fast yourselves , tense with all your power , and command the rest of your men to stand fast too — then you could hurl him back from the deep-sea ships , hard as he hurls against you , even if zeus himself impels the madman on
1	so no less swiftly aeneas strides forward now and his face shines with a glory like the god ’ s
1	their master leapt down from the bright burnished car , propped his whip on the yoke
1	so he prodded and diomedes woke from sleep with a quick start and burst of winging words : a hard man you are , old soldier — hard
1	but never fear delay , though crewmen press you hard and the course you set calls out to your sails to take the waves , and you could fill those sails with good fair winds
1	just nearing the camp , just coming up to the earthworks when they spot at a distance two men swerving off to the left
1	hercules heard the young man ’ s prayer , suppressed a groan that rose up from his heart , and wept helpless tears as the father said these tender words to his son : each man has his day , and the time of life is brief for all , and never comes again
1	so they cried to the king , cries for mercy , but only heard a merciless voice in answer : cunning antimachus !
1	once anchises has led his son through each new scene and fired his soul with a love of glory still to come , he tells him next of the wars aeneas still must wage , he tells of laurentine peoples , tells of latinus ’ city , and how he should shun or shoulder each ordeal that he must meet
1	what tactic to try , to make a breakthrough , how to shake those penned-up trojans clear of their walls and strew them down the plain ?
1	this was the bowl achilles offered up at games to commemorate his great friend — for the one racer who proved the fastest on his feet
1	why , i would be the first to counsel him to take your lead , zeus , wherever you command , my king of the black cloud !
1	but once you have ripped away prince hector 's life , back to the ships you go !
1	so mnestheus , so his dragon speeds ahead , cleaving the swells on the homestretch , so she flies along on her own forward drive
1	only deiphobus and the rugged warlord helenus have made it back alive , wounded with sturdy spears , both in the hand too , but zeus beat off their deaths
1	and you , you blessed sibyl who knows the future , grant my prayer
1	and now as the high gods bantered back and forth diomedes , loosing his war cry , charged aeneas — though what he saw was lord apollo himself , guarding , spreading his arms above the fighter , but even before the mighty god he would not flinch
1	with her spells she vows to release the hearts of those she likes , to inflict raw pain on others— to stop the rivers in midstream , reverse the stars in their courses , raise the souls of the dead at night and make earth shudder and rumble underfoot—you ’ ll see— and send the ash trees marching down the mountains
1	moving on through the crowds he found the cretans arming for combat now , ringing brave idomeneus
1	go now , patroclus dear to zeus , and question nestor
1	no shame for your wretched land , your gods of old ?
1	unexpectedly in they come , for savage allecto stalks the silent forests—some with torches charred to a point , some with heavy knotted clubs , whatever they find to hand their anger hones to weapons
1	turnus— even in flight he rebukes his men as he races , calling each by name , demanding his old familiar sword
1	father zeus , athena , apollo , if only i had ten men like nestor to plan with me among achaea 's armies — then we could topple priam 's citadel in a day , throttle it in our hands and gut troy to nothing
1	she alone , out of so many trojan mothers , dared to follow you all the way
1	message delivered , off she sped as the winds rose with a superhuman roar , stampeding clouds before them
1	think of the lion ranging the fields near carthage
1	and the trojans in turn , far across the field , pulling forces back from the last rough assault , freed their racing teams from under chariot yokes but before they thought of supper , grouped for council
1	do not hold me back
1	then i will fold her in cloud , poor girl , with all her gear and bear camilla ’ s unsullied body home to a tomb and lay her to rest in her own native land
1	now — before they topple towering ilium down , all our people slaughtered !
1	you and your archery !
1	all lie in shambles— look with your own eyes , feel with your own hands
1	gleaming in equal armor , equals now at peace , while darkness pins them down , but if they should reach the light of life , what war they ’ ll rouse between them !
1	how can you just sit back , feckless , and let them cart it off without a fight ?
1	whom would the labor of battle doom ?
1	the second , an amazon ’ s quiver bristling thracian arrows , slung from a sweeping sword-belt starred with gold and clasped with a brilliant jewel
1	but not for long would his comrades give him up : in a swift maneuver ajax wheeled them round , ajax , greatest in build , greatest in works of war of all the argives after peleus ' matchless son
1	on with it — give argive helen and all her treasures back to atreus ' sons to take away at last
1	now they are dumbstruck , driven mad by the sign they scream , some seize fire from the inner hearths , some plunder the altars—branches , brushwood , torches , they hurl them all at once and the god of fire unleashed goes raging over the benches , oarlocks , piney blazoned sterns
1	he swears that turnus alone is summoned , he alone called forth to battle
1	inspired now by the plans of his old friend , aeneas is torn by anguish all the more as dark night , looming up in her chariot , took command of the heavens , and all at once , down from the sky his father anchises ’ phantom seemed to glide and the words came rushing from him toward aeneas : my son , dearer to me than life while i was still alive !
1	but filled with anger , zeus who marshals the thunderheads let loose now : unbelievable !
1	so both men stood their ground , bracing man-to-man and a flock of comrades , hardened combat veterans followed the great ajax , ready to take his shield whenever sweat and labor sapped his knees
1	dogs and birds will have their fill — of trojan flesh , by heaven
1	quick , better to live or die , once and for all , than die by inches , slowly crushed to death — helpless against the hulls in the bloody press — by far inferior men !
1	even if all the rest of us drop and die around you , grappling for the ships , you would run no risk of death : you lack the heart to last it out in combat — coward !
1	but if we have troops and provisions still intact and the towns and men of italy still support our side , if the trojans have also paid a bloody price for glory— they have their burials too , the same storm ’ s struck us both— then why this shameful collapse before it all begins ?
1	these gloves of eryx , i ’ ll give them up for your sake , dares
1	apollo has granted this , your first flush of glory , he never envied your arrows , a match for the archer ’ s own
1	lash him with threats of the price that he will face
1	his father anchises answers : they are the spirits owed a second body by the fates
1	i will drive the west and south winds white with clouds and sweep in from the open seas a tearing gale to sear the trojan bodies and gear and spread your lethal flames !
1	the rutulians shrank in panic
1	i will never permit it
1	so he yelled and the famous spearman odysseus rushed in close and reared up to shield him
1	and last , sarpedon and valiant glaucus marched the lycians on from lycia far south , from the xanthus ' swirling rapids
1	but the lord of men agamemnon shot back , desert , by all means — if the spirit drives you home !
1	mezentius mounted up , his weight settling onto the horse ’ s back in the old familiar way , both hands holding the heft of well-honed spears , his helmet aflash with bronze and bristling horsehair crest , and into the surge of battle so he plunged , churning with mighty shame , with grief and madness all aswirl in that one fighting heart
1	he commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and summon the long-haired achaean troops to battle
1	now , for the moment , the bracing godsent night has stopped the swift achilles in his tracks
1	how i wish we had called a council then
1	a thousand terrific strokes he 's carried off — odysseus , taking the lead in tactics , mapping battle-plans
1	whoever defiles her sacred body with a wound— trojan , italian : make him pay me an equal price in blood !
1	call your men to arms with the dawn
1	never forget the latins are saturn ’ s people , fair and just , and not because we are bound by curbs or laws , but kept in check of our own accord : the way of our ancient god
1	now my army 's ruined , thanks to my own reckless pride , i would die of shame to face the men of troy and the trojan women trailing their long robes
1	if only you could burst the stern decrees of fate !
1	phoebus apollo lord of the silver bow had bred them both in perea , a brace of mares that raced the war-god 's panic through the lines
1	i was about to die
1	frenzy drives him , turnus ’ whole face is ablaze , showering sparks , his dazzling glances glinting fire— terrible , bellowing like some bull before the fight begins , trying to pour his fury into his horns , he rams a tree-trunk , charges the winds full force , stamping sprays of sand as he warms up for battle
1	here in front of your flaming pyre i will cut the throats of a dozen sons of troy in all their shining glory , venting my rage on them for your destruction !
1	to die once is enough ’ ?
1	they are the ones who brought this war upon me , devastating war against the achaeans — here , come closer , tell me the name of that tremendous fighter
1	why , any man will accept the blood-price paid for a brother murdered , a child done to death
1	pandarus and bitias— alcanor of ida ’ s offspring born by the nymph iaera once in jupiter ’ s grove—men like pines and peaks of their native land , who trusted so to their swords they fling wide the gate their captain entrusted to them , all on their own inviting enemy ranks to breach the walls
1	haul minerva ’ s effigy up to her house , we shout , offer up our prayers to the power of the goddess !
1	sit down in the ring , you two , and watch the horses — they will be home in a moment , racing hard to win
1	— both a better soldier and more loved by the gods
1	that day ranks of trojans , ranks of achaean fighters sprawled there side-by-side , facedown in the dust
1	despite my anguish i will beat it down , the fury mounting inside me , down by force
1	next he goes for sthenius , then anchemolus sprung from rhoeteus ’ age-old line , a man who dared befoul his own stepmother ’ s bed
1	the challenge still on his lips , a sudden shuddering seized him , eyes fixed in terror , the fury was looming up with so many serpents hissing , so monstrous her features now revealed
1	quick , take up your gear and off we go
1	but dauntless turnus never lost his faith in his daring , certain to seize the beaches first and hurl the invader off the land : now then , here is the answer to your prayers— we ’ ll break them all by force !
1	tityus too : you could see that son of earth , the mother of us all , his giant body splayed out over nine whole acres , a hideous vulture with hooked beak gorging down his immortal liver and innards ever ripe for torture
1	he feared his men might meet the worst at last , comrades who crossed a waste of seas for him to raise troy and mount their fierce assault
1	smeared on the old man 's head and neck the dung lay thick that he scraped up in his own hands , groveling in the filth
1	come , dismiss your ranks , have them make their meal
1	anger stirs up lies
1	again sarpedon missed — over patroclus ' left shoulder his spearhead streaked , it never touched his body
1	drawing his sharp sword achilles struck his collarbone just beside the neck and the two-edged blade drove home , plunging to the hilt — and down on the ground he sprawled , stretched facefirst and dark blood pouring out of him drenched the earth
1	he hacks their lolling necks and lops the head of their master , leaves the trunk of him spouting blood , the earth and bedding warmed with the wet black gore
1	no , dear as he is to you , and your heart grieves for him , leave sarpedon there to die in the brutal onslaught , beaten down at the hands of menoetius ' son patroclus
1	and there the man himself , turnus , his build magnificent , sword brandished , marches among his captains , topping all by a head
1	but once he looked the fast achaean drivers square in the eyes , shook the shield and loosed an enormous battle cry himself , apollo stunned the high courage in all their chests — they lost their grip , forgot their fighting-fury
1	sped by athena 's battle-plan — while staunch odysseus loosed the stamping horses , hitched them together tight with their own reins and drove them through the ruck , lashing them with his bow : he forgot to snatch the shining whip that lay in the well-wrought car
1	and now they would run in rings on their skilled feet , nimbly , quick as a crouching potter spins his wheel , palming it smoothly , giving it practice twirls to see it run , and now they would run in rows , in rows crisscrossing rows — rapturous dancing
1	what privilege are you begging for your ships ?
1	but as for achaea 's forces , all the ground that the broad trench enclosed from ships to wall was crammed with chariots , teams and men in armor packed into close quarters , yes , and the one man who packed them there , a match for rushing ares , hector the son of priam , now zeus gave hector glory
1	so they labored , the long-haired achaeans , while the gods aloft , seated at ease beside the lord of lightning , zeus , gazed down on the grand work of argives armed in bronze
1	that 's the place , i think — nowhere else are the long-haired argives so outfought
1	and so the souls are drilled in punishments , they must pay for their old offenses
1	he is the strongest argive now , i tell you
1	the ground was always steaming with fresh blood and nailed to his high and mighty doors , men ’ s faces dangled , sickening , rotting , and bled white
1	now the great array of gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long , overcome by gentle sleep
1	i thought for certain i would go to join the dead , descend to the house of death this very day — i thought i would breathed my last
1	some stalks fell in line with the reapers , row on row , and others the sheaf-binders girded round with ropes , three binders standing over the sheaves , behind them boys gathering up the cut swaths , filling their arms , supplying grain to the binders , endless bundles
1	and the men who lived in pherae fronting lake boebeis , in boebe and glaphyrae and iolcos ' sturdy ramparts : their eleven ships were led by admetus ' favored son , eumelus , born to admetus by alcestis , queen of women , the most radiant daughter pelias ever fathered
1	with that urging hermes went his way to the steep heights of olympus
1	clambering back into troy now , whipped weak with fear by the argive forces ?
1	safeguard our house , safeguard my grandson iulus !
1	king agamemnon answered crisply , tactics , my noble menelaus
1	have you forgotten — even now ?
1	and may that heartless dardan , far at sea , drink down deep the sight of our fires here and bear with him this omen of our death !
1	aeneas stopped in his tracks and huddled under his shield , crouching down on a knee but the spear in its onrush swiped the peak of his helmet off and swept away the plumes that crowned his crest
1	with that command he parted both contenders
1	now i will see if hector , for all his flashing helmet , leaps for joy when the two of us come blazing forth on the passageways of battle — or one of his trojans too will glut the dogs and birds with his fat and flesh , brought down in blood against the argive ships !
1	father zeus , when did you ever strike a mighty king with such mad blindness — then tear away his glory ?
1	nor did the man live long , not with the hate of all the gods against him
1	i too was glad to camp the night on the shipways , hopes soaring to seize their heavy rolling hulls
1	as the battle draws dead even across the plain the fury ’ s power has lived up to her promise
1	standing over him , so they would gloat and stab his body
1	then send him on his way with the wind-swift escorts , twin brothers sleep and death , who with all good speed will set him down in the broad green land of lycia
1	if only artemis had cut her down at the ships — with one quick shaft — that day i destroyed lyrnessus , chose her as my prize
1	no , jove sped iris down from the high heavens , winging strict commands for his sister , juno , if turnus did not quit the trojans ’ looming walls
1	he hands the glory to hector , today at least — tomorrow it 's ours , if he wants to give us glory
1	picked young soldiers stand in a ring around him
1	when the south wind showers mist on the mountaintops , no friend to shepherds , better than night to thieves — you can see no farther than you can fling a stone — so dust came clouding , swirling up from the feet of armies marching at top speed , trampling through the plain
1	and all-subduing sleep could not take him , not now , he turned and twisted , side to side , he longed for patroclus ' manhood , his gallant heart — what rough campaigns they would fought to an end together , what hardships they had suffered , cleaving their way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea
1	many suitors sought her all through latium , all ausonia too , and the handsomest of the lot was turnus , strong in his noble birth and breeding
1	he seized my foot , he hurled me off the tremendous threshold and all day long i dropped , i was dead weight and then , when the sun went down , down i plunged on lemnos , little breath left in me
1	so i loved him , at least : he never stinted with gifts to please my heart
1	what kind of men are these ?
1	loose those horses — or you go kill the men and leave the team to me !
1	but his son ascanius , now that he gains the name of iulus—ilus he was , while ilium ruled on high— will fill out with his own reign thirty sovereign years , a giant cycle of months revolving round and round , transferring his rule from its old lavinian home to raise up alba longa ’ s mighty ramparts
1	ah but how it galls me , it wounds me to the quick when the father tries to revile me with brute abuse , his equal in rank , our fated shares of the world the same !
1	let no lovely goddess — and no god either — try to fight against my strict decree
1	reaching the myrmidon shelters and their ships , they found him there , delighting his heart now , plucking strong and clear on the fine lyre — beautifully carved , its silver bridge set firm — he won from the spoils when he razed eetion 's city
1	awesome — as when the grip of madness seizes one who murders a man in his own fatherland and flees abroad to foreign shores , to a wealthy , noble host , and a sense of marvel runs through all who see him — so achilles marveled , beholding majestic priam
1	true , dawn on fiery dawn he drags him round his beloved comrade 's tomb , drags him ruthlessly but he can not mutilate his body
1	packs of dogs and the young herdsmen rushed to help but the lions ripping open the hide of the huge bull were gulping down the guts and the black pooling blood while the herdsmen yelled the fast pack on — no use
1	some heave on the flames the plunder stripped from the latin ranks they killed— their helmets , burnished swords , bridles , chariot wheels still glowing hot , while others burn the offerings well-known to the dead , their shields , their spears that had no luck
1	there is no more shattering blow that i could suffer
1	what are you panting after now ?
1	but argive units , spotting hector in full retreat , charged the trojans harder , their lust for battle rising
1	but once they reached the scaean gates and the great oak , there the two sides halted , waiting each other 's charge
1	quick to juno ’ s command , she lifts her wings , hissing with snakes , and quitting the airy heights of heaven , seeks her home in hell
1	but as hector backed away great ajax seized a rock — countless holding-stones for the fast trim ships were rolling round among the fighters ' feet — he hoisted one and heaved it at hector 's chest and struck him over the shield-rim , close to his throat and the blow sent hector whirling off like a whipping-top , reeling round and round
1	achilles grabbed a foot , slung him into the river , washed away downstream as he cried above him savage words to wing him on his way : there — lie there !
1	but all on his own he punts his craft with a pole and hoists sail as he ferries the dead souls in his rust-red skiff
1	then an awesome voice descended through the air , surrounding the trojan and rutulian ranks alike : no frantic rush to defend my ships , you trojans , no rising up in arms !
1	and now as then , my concern for him stands firm
1	and saw him drive achaeans against the ships that day he kept on killing , cutting them down with slashing bronze while we stood by and marveled — achilles reined us in : no fighting for us while he raged on at agamemnon
1	their hands pleading for peace while they arm their sterns with spears !
1	and no one knew
1	but quick little ajax rounded on him roughly : loose talk , idomeneus — why are you always sounding off ?
1	as they first fell from the boy ’ s lips , his father seized upon them , struck by the will of god , and made him hold his peace , and aeneas cries at once : hail to the country owed to me by fate !
1	you have done nothing to me
1	with the first light of day you will see for yourself as you convey him home
1	for the rest of troy , though , just a moment 's grief unless you too are battered down by achilles
1	good heralds of zeus and men , here , come closer
1	what is this madness blazing in your hearts ?
1	many , most of them violent ares cut the knees from under
1	a chariot-maker fells it with shining iron ax as timber to bend for handsome chariot wheels and there it lies , seasoning by the river
1	weave together some pretext for delay , while winter spends its rage and drenching orion whips the sea— the ships still battered , weather still too wild
1	but his mother , venus , stirred by fear—no wonder—by all the threats and the latins ’ violent uproar , goes to vulcan now and there in their golden bridal chamber whispers , breathing immortal love through every word : when greek kings were ravishing troy in war , her fated towers , her ramparts doomed to enemy fires , i asked no help for the victims then , i never begged for the weapons right within your skill and power
1	now , into your hands she entrusts her holy things , her household gods
1	but the argives surged to patroclus ' savage spirit — he spurred the aeantes first , both ablaze for battle : ajax , ajax !
1	trojans hold the high ground , over the beachhead there , camped against the ships — only a narrow strip to keep off sudden death
1	their spirits crowding around aeneas , left and right , beg him to linger longer—a glimpse is not enough— to walk beside him and learn the reasons why he ’ s come
1	you do not have long to live now , well i know : already i see them looming up beside you — death and the strong force of fate
1	but euaemon 's royal son laid low his son — eurypylus , chasing hypsenor fleeing on before him , flailed with a sword , slashed the trojan 's shoulder and lopped away the massive bulk of hypsenor 's arm
1	a reverent silence , all , and crown your brows with wreaths
1	that 's our battle-order , my iron-hearted trojans , just as i command
1	what do you care ?
1	in the next breath , bloated with gorgon venom , allecto launches out , first for latium , king latinus ’ lofty halls , and squats down at the quiet threshold of amata seething with all a woman ’ s anguish , fire and fury over the trojans just arrived and turnus ’ marriage lost
1	best to yield to night
1	that girl — the sons of achaea picked her as my prize , and i would sacked a walled city , won her with my spear but right from my grasp he tears her , mighty agamemnon , that son of atreus !
1	for you , i say , she lifts the thyrsus twined with ivy , dancing in your honor , letting her hair grow long , your sacred locks !
1	struggling with his wound , eurypylus answered , no hope , patroclus , prince
1	she ’ s human at first glance , down to the waist a girl with lovely breasts , but a monster of the deep below , her body a writhing horror , her belly spawns wolves flailing with dolphins ’ tails
1	so he called and the crowds fell back on either side , making way for the wagon
1	all dared an outrageous crime and what they dared , they did
1	book seventeen : menelaus ' finest hour
1	— it 's worthless as the wind !
1	your handsome face — a wonder
1	that goal in mind , i bleed my own people for gifts and food so i can build your courage , each and every man
1	insane as it is , i beg you , let me rage before i die !
1	and each commander marshals his own troops for battle , squadrons sheathed in bronze , and whets their fury with mixed accounts of the last night ’ s slaughter
1	and nisus speaks up first : euryalus , now for the daring sword-hand
1	antilochus never clear of enemies , always wheeling , bracing to face them , his own spear never resting , always brandished , quivering tense , his courage primed to cut men down with a hurl or charge them face-to-face
1	he just might impale you on his spear !
1	then , from that point on , harnessed in battle-armor , moving at forced march our army reached the alpheus ' holy ford at noon
1	no one could fight him , stop him , none but the gods as hector hurtled through the gates and his eyes flashed fire
1	but now you are back , hera — you ask me to do the impossible once again
1	when there , look , i dreamed i saw prince hector before my eyes , my comrade haggard with sorrow , streaming tears , just as he once was , when dragged behind the chariot , black with blood and grime , thongs piercing his swollen feet— what a harrowing sight !
1	the terrible gates of war with their welded iron bars will stand bolted shut , and locked inside , the frenzy of civil strife will crouch down on his savage weapons , hands pinioned behind his back with a hundred brazen shackles , monstrously roaring out from his bloody jaws
1	and i never dreamed the war would come to this : the trojans advancing all the way to our ships , men who up till now had panicked like deer , food in the woods for jackals , leopards , wolves — helpless , racing for dear life , all fight gone
1	all ranks scattered , leaving a no-man ’ s-land between them both
1	but here you come , charging out in front of all the rest with such bravado — daring to face the flying shadow of my spear
1	down he crashed , the torch dropped from his fist , right before hector 's eyes — he watched his cousin sprawl in the dust before the huge black ship and gave a stirring cry to all his units : trojans !
1	how savage the storm that broke from brute mycenae , scourging ida ’ s plains !
1	and the god of earthquakes only fueled his fire , taking the voice of thoas , son of andraemon , king over all pleuron , craggy calydon too and aetolian men he ruled revered him like a god : idomeneus , captain of cretans under arms — where have the threats all gone that sons of achaea leveled at these trojans ?
1	there is no way in the world a man can meet its edge and still survive the slashing — fear holds all men back
1	turnus kills the brothers fresh from apollo ’ s lycian fields and next menoetes who , in his youth , detested war but war would be his fate
1	and over it all , amid the hilltop lookout points there ’ s high ground , hidden , good safe shelter
1	if only he had obeyed achilles ' strict command he might have escaped his doom , the stark night of death
1	this is my pleasure , my decree
1	the brilliant achilles laid him low when he stormed cilicia 's city filled with people , thebe with her towering gates
1	there ’ s no faith left on earth !
1	here in a vast cave king aeolus rules the winds , brawling to break free , howling in full gale force as he chains them down in their dungeon , shackled fast
1	that greatest avenger , hercules !
1	no heroes either , bolting out of the argive pack for single combat !
1	but soon as a spear or bowshot wounds the king and atrides mounts his chariot once again , then i will hand hector the power to kill and kill till he cuts his way to the benched ships and the sun sinks and the blessed darkness sweeps across the earth
1	we press him hard—who is he ?
1	but grieving for all the rest , one breaks my heart the most and stabbing grief for him will take me down to death — my hector — would to god he had perished in my arms !
1	but once the ferryman , still out in the styx ’ s currents , spied them moving across the silent grove and turning toward the bank , he greets them first with a rough abrupt rebuke : stop , whoever you are at our river ’ s edge , in full armor too !
1	time and again i have gone to battle , fought with men but i have never seen an army great as this
1	that would be a disgrace
1	and you escaped that time , you fled to lyrnessus ' walls , but at one charge i sacked the place with athena 's help and father zeus , i tore the day of freedom away from all the women , dragged them off as slaves
1	some he would hand to the lords and kings — prizes of honor — and they , they hold them still
1	— i fathered hero sons in the wide realm of troy and now , now not a single one is left , i tell you
1	all the riders , following custom , wear their hair bound tight with close-cut wreaths , each bearing a pair of lances , cornel , tipped with steel
1	but it 's not the flowing feast that is on our minds now — no , a stark disaster , too much to bear , achilles bred by the gods , that is what we are staring in the face and we are afraid
1	indeed , i prefer her by far , the girl herself , i want her mine in my own house !
1	but her brother held power in tyre—pygmalion , a monster , the vilest man alive
1	men who hold fescennia ’ s ridge , aequi falisci too , the steep slopes of soracte and all flavina ’ s fields , the lake of ciminus rimmed with hills , and capena ’ s groves
1	so off she went to her room , the chamber her loving son hephaestus built her , hanging the doors from doorposts snug and tight , locked with a secret bolt no other god could draw
1	gazing out on the passageways of battle !
1	now throw helicon open , muses , launch your song !
1	they will give royal hector his fill of blows , strong on attack , glutton for battle as he is
1	his father stood at his side , lending sound advice to the boy 's own good sense : young as you are , antilochus , how the gods have loved you !
1	poor man , if only he ’ d marked his bride ’ s inspired ravings !
1	up now , set our minds on our own fighting-fury !
1	i also propose—to bear the news , confirm the pact— that a hundred envoys be dispatched , elite latin stock , their arms laden with boughs of peace and bearing gifts , hundred-weights of gold and ivory , throne and robe , our royal emblems
1	like him to the life , apollo provoked aeneas : aeneas — how could you and your men save troy with the gods against you ?
1	the games were over now
1	now as the moors adore you , feasting away on their gaudy couches , tipping wine in your honor— do you see this ?
1	laden with all their ranks came forty long black ships and phocian captains ranged them column by column , manning stations along the boeotians ' left flank
1	with that the son of magnanimous old nestor led the mare and turned her over to menelaus ' hands
1	you would never go with another to banquet on the town or feast in your own halls
1	meet me on level ground , in combat , hand-to-hand , gear up to fight on foot
1	oh , if only we had a shred of our old courage left !
1	yes , aeneas has quit his camp , his comrades and his fleet , he ’ s lighted out for the palatine hill , evander ’ s royal home
1	a twist of her wrist and the man hit the ground , springing aside as the goddess climbed aboard , blazing to fight beside the shining diomedes
1	merciless , iron man — confining your own men to the ships against their will !
1	that son-in-law from a foreign home , and he ’ s called to share my throne with equal power !
1	my sons laid low , my daughters dragged away and the treasure-chambers looted , helpless babies hurled to the earth in the red barbarity of war
1	so he mocked as athena and queen hera muttered between themselves , huddled together , plotting troy 's destruction
1	and telamon 's giant son agreed at once
1	mezentius ’ hissing sling— keeping its strap taut and dropping his spears , three times he whipped it around his head , let fly and the lead shot , sizzling hot in flight , split his enemy ’ s skull and splayed him out headfirst on a bank of sand
1	and the lines of fighters clash , matched in chiefs , in power , the rearguard packs tight , no room for maneuver , no spear hurled in the press
1	— he may respect my age , may pity an old man
1	if we can escape our death — if war and plague are joining forces now to crush the argives
1	i ca not make them out
1	and to steel her new resolve to leave the light , she sees , laying gifts on the altars steaming incense— shudder to hear it now—the holy water going black and the wine she pours congeals in bloody filth
1	why tremble so before the trumpet blares ?
1	and now his mother began to tear her hair
1	zeus and fate and the fury stalking through the night , they are the ones who drove that savage madness in my heart , that day in assembly when i seized achilles ' prize — on my own authority , true , but what could i do ?
1	no , not even now would the causes of her rage , her bitter sorrows drop from the goddess ’ mind
1	as a stallion full-fed at the manger , stalled too long , breaking free of his tether gallops down the plain , out for his favorite plunge in a river 's cool currents , thundering in his pride — his head flung back , his mane streaming over his shoulders , sure and sleek in his glory , knees racing him on to the fields and stallion-haunts he loves — so down from pergamus heights came paris , son of priam , glittering in his armor like the sun astride the skies , exultant , laughing aloud , his fast feet sped him on
1	lifting it from the chest he purified it with sulphur crystals first then rinsed it out with water running clear , washed his hands and filled it bright with wine
1	aphrodite daughter of zeus beat off the packs , day and night , anointing hector 's body with oil , ambrosial oil of roses , so achilles could not rip the prince 's skin as he dragged him back and forth
1	meriones , who had come in fourth took fourth prize , the two bars of gold
1	not with honor — you , the finest men in all our ranks
1	when they had put aside desire for food and drink , the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all
1	all day the rutulians encircle every entry , battling on to bring their enemies down in blood and ring their walls with fire
1	they reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they had put aside desire for food and drink , ajax nodded to phoenix
1	how can he strike out at the enemy ?
1	where 's his war-gear lying ?
1	but soon as the white-armed goddess hera saw them mauling argive units caught in the bloody press , she winged her words at pallas : what disaster !
1	as arruns starts to circle swift camilla , a match for her spear yet more adept at cunning
1	then , spent as they were from all their toil , they set out food , the bounty of ceres , drenched in sea-salt , ceres ’ utensils too , her mills and troughs , and bend to parch with fire the grain they had salvaged , grind it fine on stones
1	uncontrollable hera — you and your treachery — halting hector 's assault and routing hector 's armies
1	hundreds of plunging war-teams dragging chariots down , snapping the yoke-poles , ditched their masters ' cars and patroclus charged them , heart afire for the kill , shouting his argives forward — slaughter trojans !
1	atrides hurled and missed , his spearshaft just slanting aside the man 's flank as iphidamas went for the waist beneath the breastplate — he stabbed home , leaning into the blow full weight , trusting his heavy hand but failed to pierce the glittering belt , failed flat-out — the point , smashing against the silver , bent back like lead
1	we will simply offer the argives tactics that may save them — so they wo not all fall beneath your blazing wrath
1	we will stay clear and escape the father 's rage
1	so , violating the peace , he tells his captains : march on king latinus—gear up for war !
1	strangers will come , and come to be your sons and their lifeblood will lift our name to the stars
1	they know him at once , his hated face , his immense frame , and aeneas ’ troops are stunned
1	turning to go , his helmet flashing , tall hector answered , do not ask me to sit beside you here , helen
1	the staff and the wreaths of god will never save you then
1	with that he seizes a heavy lance and wings it hard and straight through the bronze of maeon ’ s shield it pounds , ripping open his breast and breastplate both at once
1	turnus lowered his eyes and reached with his right hand and begged , a suppliant : i deserve it all
1	antilochus kneeling near , weeping uncontrollably , clutched achilles ' hands as he wept his proud heart out — for fear he would slash his throat with an iron blade
1	what ’ s more , i will pair you with pallas , my hope , my comfort
1	hector kept on ranging , battling ranks on ranks , slashing his spear and sword and flinging heavy rocks but he stayed clear of attacking ajax man-to-man
1	from here , his old tuscan home of corythus , he set sail , and now a golden palace high in the starry heavens welcomes him to a throne , and his altars add a name to the growing roster of the gods
1	he traded his gold armor for bronze with diomedes , the worth of a hundred oxen just for nine
1	no lame old age can cripple our high spirits , sap our vigor , no , we tamp our helmets down on our gray heads , and our great joy is always to haul fresh booty home and live off all we seize
1	whatever the stand-off round the sturdy walls of troy , with greek victory hanging fire until the tenth year came , was all thanks to aeneas ’ and hector ’ s strong right arms
1	aeneas of troy , famous for his devotion , feats of arms , goes down to the deepest shades of hell to see his father
1	up and at it , shipmates , man the thwarts !
1	— so i can declare to her my solemn , sound decree : achilles must receive a ransom from king priam , achilles must give hector 's body back
1	the rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship
1	so i gave way at last and lifting my father , headed toward the mountains
1	we ’ ll even be glad to raise your mighty walls ordained by fate , glad to shoulder up the foundation stones of troy !
1	now look what a wretched death i am doomed to suffer , trapped in this monstrous river like some boy , some pig-boy swept away , trying to ford a winter torrent in a storm !
1	gyas commands the huge chimaera , a hulk as huge as a city—trojans in three tiers drive her on , churning as one man at three ranked sweeps of oars
1	as the trojan charged head-on achilles speared him square in the brows — his whole skull split in half and down he crashed , achilles exulting over him : here you lie , otrynteus ' son — most terrible man alive !
1	now , as long as the armies fought to take the rampart , far from the fast ships , patroclus sat it out in his friend eurypylus ' shelter
1	another god might fear their wall — their idle whim — one far weaker than you in strength of hand and fury
1	trojan-born acestes relishes his new kingdom , holding court , giving laws to the elders called in session
1	the world was split three ways
1	three shafts of jagged hail they ’ d riveted on that weapon , three of bursting stormclouds , three of blood-red flame and the southwind winging fast
1	i will even honor him on a par with my orestes , full-grown by now , reared in the lap of luxury
1	the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs from zeus are about to crush the men of troy !
1	victors and victims killing , killed in turn : both sides locked , not a thought of flight , not here
1	even if you killed me , would priam drop his crown in your hands — for that ?
1	what , is a woman routing squadrons strong as ours ?
1	so straight to the king she went , blurting out her lies : ' i wish you would die , proetus , if you do not kill bellerophon !
1	there they stay , motionless , never slip from sequence
1	the old man 's taunts brought nine men to their feet
1	shrunken so , the demon flutters over and over again in turnus ’ face , screeching , drumming his shield with its whirring wings
1	young trojan recruits , keen to have a look , came scurrying up from all sides , crowding round , outdoing each other to make a mockery of the captive
1	apollo did not neglect the father 's orders
1	for long i ’ ve watched you trying to fight against it , all for nothing
1	over against them , trojans ripping the tiles and turrets from all their roofs—the end is near , they can see it now , at the brink of death , desperate for weapons , some defense , and these , these missiles they send reeling down on the greeks ’ heads—the gilded beams , the inlaid glory of all our ancient fathers
1	chariots too are rolled along , splashed to the rails with latin blood
1	if achilles fails to learn all this from our own immortal voices he will quail when a god attacks him face-to-face
1	then we can calm the god , and only then appease him
1	when one looks out for himself , alert but alone , his reach is shorter — his sly moves miss the mark
1	then over his shoulder agamemnon slung his sword , golden studs at the hilt , the blade burnished bright and the scabbard sheathed in silver swung on golden straps , and he grasped a well-wrought shield to encase his body , forged for rushing forays — beautiful , blazoned work
1	all obey me now
1	a cup for the hands of each guest — here beneath my roof are the men i love the most
1	now as they flex their bows to a curve with all their force , all each man can muster , drawing shafts from quivers , young hippocoön shot first , his bowstring twanged , his whizzing arrow ripped through the swift air and struck home , fixed deep in the timber mast
1	so why not go back now , hurl your challenge at menelaus dear to ares , fight it out together , man-to-man again ?
1	but what if they round on us ?
1	and here they display a cavern , an awesome breathing-vent for the savage god of death , and a vast swirling gorge spreads wide its lethal jaws where the acheron bursts through , and here the fury hid her hateful power , releasing earth and sky
1	but tomorrow at daybreak , armed to the hilt for battle , we man the towering ramparts
1	but paris flared in rage at his comrade 's death , his friend and guest among all the paphlagonians
1	he orders his own captains to carry tree-trunks clad in enemy arms , with the hated names engraved
1	what can i say first ?
1	my kinsman offered a gleaming sword-belt , rich red , bellerophon gave a cup , two-handled , solid gold — i left it at home when i set out for troy
1	an enormous oak , its branches lopped and trunk laid bare , he stakes on a mound and decks with the burnished arms he stripped from mezentius , that strong captain : a trophy to you , mars , the great god of war
1	noble nestor was first , achaea 's watch and ward , pleading , begging each man for his parents ' sake , be men , my friends !
1	head for the rocks , menoetes !
1	fighting words , and ares pounded his sturdy thighs with the flats of both hands and let loose in grief : now , you gods of olympus — who could blame me now if i descend on achaea 's ships to avenge my son , my butchered son ?
1	if you , a phoenician , fix your eyes on carthage , a libyan stronghold , tell me , why do you grudge the trojans their new homes on italian soil ?
1	so she urged and the swift runner complied at once : i must — when the two of you hand down commands , goddess , a man submits though his heart breaks with fury
1	so both men parted , ajax back to achaea 's armies , hector back to his thronging trojans — overjoyed to see him still alive , unharmed , striding back , free of the rage and hands of ajax still unconquered
1	what ’ s left for me now ?
1	what disgrace for us — to return without a fight to the bronze-floored house of zeus on mount olympus !
1	so how could i , claiming to be the highest goddess — both by birth and since i am called your consort and you in turn rule all the immortal gods — how could i hold back from these , these trojans , men i loathe , and fail to weave their ruin ?
1	and taking a rugged spearshaft tipped with whetted bronze the archer went on the run to stand by ajax ' side
1	dido , trying to raise her heavy eyes once more , failed— deep in her heart the wound kept rasping , hissing on
1	here pallas drives and lunges , lausus opposes him , all but equal in age , remarkably handsome , both , but fortune grudged them both safe passage home
1	but queen hera , her eyes wide , protested strongly : dread majesty , son of cronus — what are you saying ?
1	and first a strange radiance flashed in all eyes and a great cloud appearing out of the dawn came sweeping down the sky , trailed by the goddess ’ dancing troupes from ida
1	no , through the shocks of war , through walls of fire , they ’ ve found a way !
1	to witness the outrage agamemnon just committed ?
1	heartsick , he cloaks the boy with one as a final tribute , covering locks that soon will face the fire
1	is this the end he promised ?
1	whatever i might ask ?
1	rearing in their defense my war-team , hector 's horses were charging out to battle , galloping , full stretch
1	then on the twelfth some god cast him into achilles ' hands again and now he would send him off on a new journey , resisting all the way to the house of death
1	but devout aeneas makes his way to the stronghold that apollo rules , throned on high , and set apart is a vast cave , the awesome sybil ’ s secret haunt where the seer of delos breathes his mighty will , his soul inspiring her to lay the future bare
1	how on earth can a wounded man make war ?
1	like the wolf that ’ s killed some shepherd or hulking ox and before attacking spears can catch him , races off at once , darting into the pathless hills for cover— he knows he ’ s done some outrage—frantic now , he tucks his trembling tail between his legs and heads for the woods
1	but still not satisfied , he ’ s made his way to the farthest towns of corythus , arming a band of tuscans , countryfolk he ’ s mustered
1	we saw him drown at sea ourselves
1	but no comfort could reach the fighter 's heart till he went striding into the jaws of bloody war
1	still , just as you are , go out to the broad trench and show yourself to the trojans
1	nor will your mother lay your corpse on a bier and mourn her darling son — whirling scamander will roll you down the sea 's broad bosom !
1	your face , your features—hardly a mortal ’ s looks and the tone of your voice is hardly human either
1	and turnus wheels , dropping the task at hand and full of fury , speeds to the trojan gate to face the headstrong brothers
1	so in his house they raised the dirges for the dead , for hector still alive , his people were so convinced that never again would he come home from battle , never escape the argives ' rage and bloody hands
1	but , oh how wrong to rely on gods dead set against you !
1	fifty ships came freighted with these contingents , one hundred and twenty young boeotians manning each
1	still dead even , they plow their furrows , ripping the sea wide open with thrashing oars and cleaving triple beaks
1	and helen in all her radiance , her long robes , replied , why , that 's the giant ajax , bulwark of the achaeans
1	who were the kings ?
1	seeing the eagle sent their way from zeus , they roused their war-lust , flung themselves on the trojans with a vengeance
1	ah but now , since i have no desire to battle glorious hector , tomorrow at daybreak , once i have sacrificed to zeus and all the gods and loaded up my holds and launched out on the breakers — watch , my friend , if you will take the time and care to see me off , and you will see my squadrons sail at dawn , fanning out on the hellespont that swarms with fish , my crews manning the oarlocks , rowing out with a will , and if the famed god of the earthquake grants us safe passage , the third day out we raise the dark rich soil of phthia
1	but she heard the groans and wails of grief from the rampart now and her body shook , her shuttle dropped to the ground , she called out to her lovely waiting women , quickly — two of you follow me — i must see what 's happened
1	my sister , turnus replies , i recognized you long ago , yes , when you first broke up our treaty with your wiles and threw yourself into combat
1	but king agamemnon countered , not so quickly , brave as you are , godlike achilles — trying to cheat me
1	look , it ’ s your own ascanius !
1	this one forced himself on his daughter ’ s bed and sealed a forbidden marriage
1	then each can see for himself who comes in second , who takes off first prize
1	meriones killed phereclus — son of tecton , son of the blacksmith harmon — the fighter 's hands had the skill to craft all kinds of complex work since pallas athena loved him most , her protege who had built paris his steady , balanced ships , trim launchers of death , freighted with death for all of troy and now for the shipwright too : what could the man know of all the gods ' decrees ?
1	lichas next—cut live from his dead mother ’ s womb and hallowed to you , the healer— but what good now to elude the knife at birth ?
1	stripped of everything , now it ’ s past our power to reward you gift for gift , dido , theirs as well , whoever may survive of the dardan people still , strewn over the wide world now
1	but the boar stands fast , unflinching—where to charge ? — anywhere—grinding his tusks and shaking spears from his back
1	twice they plucked you safe from the ruins of troy
1	and next he caught erylaus closing , lunging in — he flung a rock and it struck between his eyes and the man 's whole skull split in his heavy helmet , down the trojan slammed on the ground , head-down and courage-shattering death engulfed his corpse
1	aeneas cries , so rushed !
1	you with your gentle temper , all your gentle words
1	the design is mine
1	just as he led his armies here for nothing , failure
1	the souls already crouched at the long thwarts— he brusquely thrusts them out , clearing the gangways , quickly taking massive aeneas aboard the little skiff
1	your name and armor mark the site , my friend , but i could not find you , could not bury your bones in native soil when i set out to sea
1	i hate that man like the very gates of death who says one thing but hides another in his heart
1	give our enemy glory or win it for ourselves !
1	down you go to troy 's and achaea 's armies now — and see that the trojans break the sworn truce first and trample on the argives in their triumph
1	now from its depths she seemed to catch his voice , the words of her dead husband calling out her name while night enclosed the earth in its dark shroud , and over and over a lonely owl perched on the rooftops drew out its low , throaty call to a long wailing dirge
1	again and again the brilliant swift achilles whirled , trying to stand and fight the river man-to-man and see if all the immortal gods who rule the vaulting skies were after him , putting him to rout — again and again the mighty crest of the river fed by the rains of zeus came battering down his shoulders , down from high above but achilles kept on leaping , higher , desperate now as the river kept on dragging down his knees , lunging under him , cutting the ground from under his legs
1	and achilles rose and challenged all the argives : we invite two men — our best — to compete for these
1	just add one gift to the hoards you tell us now to give and pledge the dardans
1	i will make you a sacrifice , a yearling heifer broad in the brow , unbroken , never yoked by men
1	muster the crews on shore , all tackle set to sail , but the cause for our new course , you keep it secret
1	and the old man rejoiced at that , bursting out , o my child , how good it is to give the immortals fit and proper gifts !
1	and just behind him , ancus , full of the old bravado , even now too swayed by the breeze of public favor
1	not once , i swear , did i pass some handsome shrine of yours , sailing my oar-swept ship on our fatal voyage here , but on each i burned the fat and thighs of oxen , longing to raze troy 's sturdy walls to the roots
1	but hector keeps his terrible fury blazing , keeps his bronze spear stabbing and never stops the slaughter — zeus hands him glory !
1	and vulcan forged them too , the mother wolf stretched out in the green grotto of mars , twin boys at her dugs , who hung there , frisky , suckling without a fear as she with her lithe neck bent back , stroking each in turn , licked her wolf pups into shape with a mother ’ s tongue
1	for all his fury , trust me , he will quake before he penetrates our front
1	do not harbor it deep inside you
1	disgraces — have you no shame ?
1	another zone where a torrent had hurled down boulders , heaving them far and wide and torn out trees from its banks
1	so let him die , outright — let a god wipe him out !
1	must not give you orders
1	my fame goes past the skies
1	turn your blades on me , rutulians !
1	at first light idaeus went to the beaked ships and out on the meeting grounds he found the argives , veterans close by the stern of agamemnon 's ship
1	alert as a hunting hound that lights on a trapped stag , hemmed in by a river ’ s bend or frightened back by the ropes with blood-red feathers—the hound barking , closing , fast as the quarry , panicked by traps and the steep riverbanks , runs off and back in a thousand ways but the umbrian hound , keen for the kill , hangs on the trail , his jaws agape— and now , now he ’ s got him , thinks he ’ s got him , yes and his jaws clap shut , stymied , champing the empty air
1	one sector , as he decrees , called troy , another , ilium
1	you throw to the winds the will of cronus ' son — time and again zeus gave you strict commands : stand by the trojan ranks and save their lives till the sun goes down at last and darkness shrouds the plowlands ripe with grain !
1	and after him came atrides , red-haired menelaus , next antilochus , urging his father 's horses : drive , the two of you — full stretch and fast !
1	father , bow your head in assent !
1	thanks to you , the african tribes , numidian warlords hate me , even my own tyrians rise against me
1	and striding out on shore they soared to the high sky and found farseeing zeus , and around him all the gods who live in bliss forever sat in a grand assembly
1	terrified of the trojans ’ hate , now troy was overpowered , terrified of the greeks ’ revenge , her deserted husband ’ s rage— that universal fury , a curse to troy and her native land and here she lurked , skulking , a thing of loathing cowering at the altar : helen
1	so much the better if i had
1	but if you hold back from the bloody foray here or turn some other soldier back from battle , winning him over — you with your soft appeals — at one quick stroke my spear will beat you down , you will breathe your last !
1	a joy it will be one day , perhaps , to remember even this
1	i give you this prize , a gift for giving 's sake , for now you will never fight with fists or wrestle , or enter the spear-throw , or race on sprinting feet
1	euryalus , nisus asks , do the gods light this fire in our hearts or does each man ’ s mad desire become his god ?
1	if only olympian zeus the lord of lightning grants us strength to repel this trojan charge then carve a passage through to troy 's high walls !
1	straddling his brother , acamas thrust and speared boeotian promachus , trying to drag the corpse by the feet , and acamas loosed his cry of exultation , argives — glorious braggarts , you , insatiate with your threats !
1	fortune may have made me a man of misery but , wicked as she is , she can ’ t make sinon a lying fraud as well
1	just as an instant sleep stole in and left him limp , the god , rearing over him , hurled him into the churning surf and down he went , headfirst , wrenching a piece of rudder off and the tiller too , and crying out to his shipmates time and again—no use— as the god himself goes winging off into thin air
1	they held tight as a working widow holds the scales , painstakingly grips the beam and lifts the weight and the wool together , balancing both sides even , struggling to win a grim subsistence for her children
1	no more war at a distance , waiting to take the long flights of spears and arrows — they stood there man-to-man and matched their fury , killing each other now with hatchets , battle-axes , big swords , two-edged spears , and many a blade , magnificent , heavy-hilted and thonged in black lay strewn on the ground — some dropped from hands , some fell as the fighters ' shoulder-straps were cut — and the earth ran black with blood
1	well , you will never plant your lance in my back as i flee you in fear — plunge it through my chest as i come charging in , if a god gives you the chance !
1	where are you headed now ?
1	here aeneas ’ frightened shadow throws itself into hiding , turnus hard on its heels , nothing can keep him back , bounding over the gangways , leaping the high decks
1	now then , launching out as the wind bears you toward sicilian shores and pelorus ’ crowded headlands open up a passage , steer for the lands to port , the seas to port , in a long southern sweep around the coast , but stay clear of the heavy surf to starboard
1	but if fighting 's flaring up in their own sector , at least let the rugged giant ajax come alone with teucer the master archer at his side
1	leading his troupe of eunuchs , his hair oozing oil , a phrygian bonnet tucked up under his chin , he revels in all that he has filched , while we keep bearing gifts to your temples—yes , yours—coddling your reputation , all your hollow show !
1	but all in the house is turmoil , misery , groans , the echoing chambers ring with cries of women , wails of mourning hit the golden stars
1	panthous ' son euphorbus , the best of his own age at spears and a horseman 's skill and speed of foot , and even in this , his first attack in chariots — just learning the arts of war — he would brought down twenty drivers off their cars
1	let bygones be bygones
1	but ours calls us on from one ordeal to the next
1	if you have the daring to stand against my heavy spear its point will rip your soft warm skin to shreds !
1	and the sibyl says no more but into the yawning cave she flings herself , possessed— he follows her boldly , matching stride for stride
1	they above all — we put those men in charge
1	but euryalus tears off rhamnes ’ battle-emblems and gold-studded belt : gifts that lavish caedicus once sent remulus of tibur , hoping to seal a pact with a friend then far away , and remulus , dying , passed them on to his grandson and , once he died , the latins commandeered them in battle , spoils of war
1	if only i ’ d been free to live my life , untested in marriage , free of guilt as some wild beast untouched by pangs like these !
1	hector amidst them now engaged them with a vengeance , doing bloody work with lances flung and a master 's horsemanship , destroying young battalions
1	why holding back , why now , why drag your heels ?
1	tame to the touch , it liked to frequent its master ’ s table
1	day after day i have gone against the trojans , never hanging back by the ships , i swear , old warrior that i am — but i have never seen such horses , never dreamed
1	but now he was bent on breaking men , probing the lines wherever he saw the largest mass and the finest gear but he could not smash through yet for all his fury
1	i am on my way to olympus heights , to the famous smith hephaestus — i pray he will give my son some fabulous armor full of the god 's great fire !
1	quick through the onset — better save him now !
1	ah , no wonder the men of troy and argives under arms have suffered years of agony all for her , for such a woman
1	while there they sit at their royal ease , exulting , the goddess of love and apollo lord of the silver bow : they loosed this manic ares — he has no sense of justice
1	then let us place his bones in a golden urn , sealed tight and dry with a double fold of fat , till i myself lie hid in the strong house of death
1	and seeing odysseus bleeding there the trojan troops exulted , calling across the melee , charging him in a mass as edging , backing off he gave ground now , calling his own companions
1	his heirs will blaze in courage , their might will sway the world
1	and rinsing off , their skin sleek with an olive oil rub , they sat down to their meal and dipping up their cups from an overflowing bowl , they poured them forth — honeyed , mellow wine to the great goddess athena
1	and at last he speaks out , filled with joy : may the gods speed the plans that we launch here , their own omens too !
1	and the great spearman idomeneus led his cretans , the men who held cnossos and gortyn ringed in walls , lyctos , miletus , lycastus ' bright chalk bluffs , phaestos and rhytion , cities a joy to live in — the men who peopled crete , a hundred cities strong
1	the fatherly captain smiled down at his friend and had them fetch a shield , didymaon ’ s work the greeks had torn from neptune ’ s sacred gate
1	but soon as achilles grew arm-weary from killing , twelve young trojans he rounded up from the river , took them all alive as the blood-price for patroclus ' death , menoetius ' son
1	with a hand uncallused still she flung her baby spears , swirled a sling-shot round her head with its supple strap and bagged a crane or snowy swan by the strymon ’ s banks
1	so they fought to the death around that benched beaked ship as patroclus reached achilles , his great commander , and wept warm tears like a dark spring running down some desolate rock face , its shaded currents flowing
1	your pleading repels me now — you must have something better than this to say
1	all of them—what disgrace—i deserted them all to die an unspeakable death
1	but then as i madly rushed from house to house , no end in sight , abruptly , right before my eyes i saw her stricken ghost , my own creusa ’ s shade
1	younger than nestor , the next generation up , flush with their fresh strength
1	he led an escort formed of the brave old soldier nestor 's sons , meges the son of phyleus , meriones and thoas , lycomedes the son of creon , melanippus too
1	but not even now would trojans and prince hector have burst apart the rampart 's gates and huge bar if zeus the master strategist had not driven his own son sarpedon straight at the argives , strong as a lion raiding crook-horned cattle
1	down through the vast encampment of achaea , the faster to rouse the slashing god of war !
1	but whatever death lays bare , all wounds are marks of glory
1	whether you ’ d like to attack from left or right or stand on the ridge and roll huge boulders down
1	as the wheeling sun swung round to the full light of day and put the dark to flight , first he commands his troops to follow orders , brace their hearts for battle , gear for war
1	folded deep in that bed they lay and round them wrapped a marvelous cloud of gold , and glistening showers of dew rained down around them both
1	the new thatch bristled thick on romulus ’ palace roof and here the silver goose went ruffling through the gold arcades , squawking its warning—gauls attack the gates !
1	wherever you are now — in lycia 's rich green country or here in troy , wherever on earth , you can hear a man in pain , you have that power , and pain comes on me now
1	but now , i see , he only plotted brutal treachery : now he commands me back to argos in disgrace , whole regiments of my men destroyed in battle
1	help either side as the fixed desire drives each god to act
1	but if my son was doomed to an early death , to know he died after killing volscian hordes and died as he led the trojans into latium : that will be my joy
1	you guided the arrow of paris , pierced achilles ’ body
1	whoever begs his mercy he will spare with all the kindness in his heart
1	i saw him myself , pyrrhus crazed with carnage and atreus ’ two sons just at the threshold— i saw hecuba with her hundred daughters and daughters-in-law , saw priam fouling with blood the altar fires he himself had blessed
1	down from the woods and high hills they lumber in alarm , the tribe of cyclops , down to the harbor , crowding the shore , the brotherhood of etna !
1	not all they claim was stored in the depths of troy , that city built on riches , in the old days of peace before the sons of achaea came — not all the gold held fast in the archer 's rocky vaults , in phoebus apollo 's house on pytho 's sheer cliffs !
1	you , old man , you would overpower us all !
1	the girl — i wo not give up the girl
1	soon as i tear the first stalk from its roots and rip it up from the earth
1	and so the powers assembled deep in zeus 's halls
1	i too have a noble birth to boast — my father , tydeus , mounded over now by the earth of thebes
1	you ’ ve threaded the rocks resounding with scylla ’ s howling rabid dogs , and taken the brunt of the cyclops ’ boulders , too
1	this strong right arm will put our truce to the proof
1	pray for a bird of omen , zeus 's wind-swift messenger , the dearest bird in the world to his prophetic heart , the strongest thing on wings — clear on the right so you can see that sign with your own eyes and trust your life to it as you venture down to achaea 's ships and the fast chariot-teams
1	i look back—what forces still stood by me ?
1	and back apollo strode , a god in the wars of men
1	the herald obeyed his captain 's orders quickly
1	never by will of mine did the god of earthquakes wreak havoc among the trojan ranks and hector and surge to help their foes !
1	take and return our trust
1	still the trojan exulted , wild with hopes of triumph as menelaus , drawing his sword with silver studs , leapt at pisander , who clutched beneath his shield his good bronze ax with its cleaving blade set on a long smooth olive haft — a clash !
1	i could scarcely interject a word , dismayed , i stuttered a few breathless phrases : alive , yes
1	tarchon himself has sent me envoys , bearing the crown and scepter , offering me the ensigns , urging : join our camp , take the etruscan throne
1	athena 's eyes are shining on you both !
1	anchises , silent a moment , drawing his son and sibyl with him into the midst of the vast murmuring throng , took his stand on a rise of ground where he could scan the long column marching toward him , soul by soul , and recognize their features as they neared
1	so staunch antilochus leapt at you , melanippus , stripping away your gear , but hector marked it now and straight through the ruck he charged antilochus hard
1	not that he quit the foray even then — he sprang at coon , gripping his big spear shaft tough from the gusting wind that whipped its tree
1	now it was king agamemnon 's turn to address them
1	bursting into tears the goddess slipped from under her clutch like a wild dove that flies from a hawk 's attack to a hollow rocky cleft for it 's not the quarry 's destiny to be caught — so she fled in tears , her archery left on the spot
1	by now some fighter better than he , a stronger hand has gone down in his own blood , or soon will go
1	and agamemnon the lord of men consented quickly : that 's no lie , old man — a full account you give of all my acts of madness
1	the next to die ?
1	now , making offerings to my mother , dione ’ s daughter , and to the gods who bless new ventures , i was poised , there on the beach , to slaughter a pure white bull to jove above all who rules the powers on high
1	for ten days the seer , silent , closed off in his tent , refused to say a word or betray a man to death
1	you ’ ll soon see the waves a chaos of ships , lethal torches flaring , the whole coast ablaze , if now a new dawn breaks and finds you still malingering on these shores
1	seizing a glinting whip , his fist on the handgrip , automedon leapt aboard behind the team and behind him achilles struck his stance , helmed for battle now , glittering in his armor like the sun astride the skies , his ringing , daunting voice commanding his father 's horses : roan beauty and charger , illustrious foals of lightfoot !
1	that gift will hold me here by the beaked ships as long as the life breath remains inside my chest and my springing knees will lift me
1	they next draw lots for starting places , captains stand on the sterns , their purple-and-gold regalia gleaming far afield
1	eunaeus , son of clytius , first
1	the night comes on at last
1	so i vowed at first
1	here 's some advice , not to be tossed aside , and i will tell it clearly
1	such fire athena blazed from tydides ' head and shoulders , drove him into the center where the masses struggled on
1	and zeus suspected nothing , not a word of treachery
1	you alone have pitied the long ordeals of troy—unspeakable— and here you would share your city and your home with us , this remnant left by the greeks
1	i will help you remember — you will give up your treacheries , you will see if your warm embraces serve you then , your bed of lust where you sank me in your arms
1	we can all banquet here to our heart 's content
1	now on with it , great pelides , let us fight !
1	and so poseidon shrank from defending allies out in the open — all in secret , always armed like a man the god kept urging armies on
1	why go over that unforgiving ground again ?
1	but the cretan captain idomeneus countered , spears ?
1	and now the prince , the captain of men aeneas would have died on the spot if zeus 's daughter had not marked him quickly , his mother aphrodite who bore him to king anchises tending cattle once
1	but patroclus , giving a cry to automedon whipping on his team , patroclus went for troy 's and lycia 's lines , blind in his fatal frenzy — luckless soldier
1	spurring his men while hector aflash in armor urged his trojans — thinking he would even go up against achilles : no fear of pelides now , my gallant trojans !
1	and the voice of sleep the soft and soothing drifted back
1	hold fast to my words and keep them well in mind to comfort your hard lot
1	and your fathers filled your ears with marching orders
1	but you , you wipe such thoughts from your mind
1	then , at last , at the end of their rope , his people revolt against that raving madman , they besiege mezentius and his palace , hack his henchmen down and fling fire on his roof
1	and at daybreak , marshal agamemnon , rouse your troops to fell and haul in timber , and furnish all that 's fitting , all the dead man needs for his journey down the western dark
1	so now i mourn your death — i will never stop — you were always kind
1	when he yokes his team , the sun shines down on us as well
1	so now the heart of aeneas leapt inside his chest when he saw the flocks of fighters crowding in his wake
1	so cast your fear to the winds
1	and then he revealed an unknown ancient treasure , an untold weight of silver and gold , a comrade to speed her on her way
1	with that , he rounded hard on lausus ’ comrades , slow to move , and lifted their captain ’ s body off the ground where lausus was defiling his braided hair with blood
1	why recall it all , the armada burned to ash on the shores of eryx ?
1	charging forward as always , head-on , until polydamas speared his shoulder — just grazing its ridge but grating bone — he thrust at point-blank range
1	and set apart , the virtuous souls , with cato giving laws
1	even latinus flees , cradling his defeated gods and shattered pact of peace
1	so , hecuba ’ s not the only one who spawned a firebrand , who brought to birth a wedding torch of a son
1	if it 's spears you want , you will find not one but twenty , all propped on my shelter 's shining inner wall : trojan weapons , stripped from the men i kill
1	just as you see achilles charge the front once more , hurling his bronze spear , smashing troy 's battalions — so each of you remember to battle down your man !
1	go now , take your meal — the sooner to bring on war
1	he grasped them both by the hands and hugged their shoulders , tears rivering down his cheeks : for you , good men , what reward can i find to equal the noble work you ’ re set on ?
1	and you , my father , carry our hearth-gods now , our fathers ’ sacred vessels
1	three squadrons with three captains weave their ways , each leading a column of twelve , six boys in double file , a trainer beside each troupe , all shining in the sun
1	lycian stalwarts could not force the achaeans back , breach their wall and burst through to the ships , nor could achaean spearmen hurl the lycians back , clear of the rampart , once they would made their stand
1	complex as the course the sons of troy now follow , weaving their way through mock escapes and clashes all in sport as swiftly as frisky dolphins skim the rolling surf , cleaving the libyan or carpathian seas in play
1	never again will i embrace him striding home through the doors of peleus ' house
1	patroclus — soon as the fighter cut their front battalions off he swerved back to pin them against the warships , never letting the trojans stream back up to troy as they struggled madly on — but there mid-field between the ships , the river and beetling wall patroclus kept on sweeping in , hacking them down , making them pay the price for argives slaughtered
1	afterward he must suffer what the fates spun out on the doomed fighter 's life line drawn that day his mother gave him birth
1	dares , dazed the most , shrinks back from the bout
1	for the fourth he set out two gold bars , for the fifth , untouched by fire as well , a good two-handled jar
1	and not only short , now , but filled with heartbreak too , more than all other men alive — doomed twice over
1	serestus gathers the armor , shoulders it home to you , king mars , your trophy now
1	there ’ s no fighting it , no making way against it , we ’ re too weak
1	to harass the trojans over land and sea , to ignite an unspeakable war , degrade a royal house and blend the wedding hymn with the dirge of grief : all that lay in your power
1	he ’ s on in years , but a god ’ s old age is hale and green
1	then at last , at the fourth dawn—landfall , rearing up into view , some mountains clear in the offing , a rising curl of smoke
1	no turning the tide till we wheel and face this man with team and car and fight it out with weapons hand-to-hand
1	but first , according to time-honored custom , i will test the men with a challenge , tell them all to crowd the oarlocks , cut and run in their ships
1	you , he argued , you in your prime , untouched by age , your blood still coursing strong , you hearts of oak , you are the ones to hurry your escape
1	what are their bodies made of , rock or iron to block your tearing bronze ?
1	but again some god swoops down and saves this hector — and has not he wiped enough of us out already ?
1	cries hit the heavens—now it ’ s the latins ’ time to turn tail and flee across the fields in a cloud of dust
1	you won me the scepter , jupiter ’ s favors too , and a couch to lounge on , set at the gods ’ feasts— you made me lord of the stormwind , king of cloudbursts
1	both of you , better yet , that 's best of all
1	so achilles , drawing the sharp sword at his hip , sprang at the man in rage as he tried to wrench pelides ' spear from the bank but his grip failed
1	outraged by my innocent friend ’ s demise until i burst out like a madman , swore if i ever returned in triumph to our native argos , ever got the chance i ’ d take revenge , and my oath provoked a storm of hatred
1	tracking a stray mule or a lost companion ?
1	achaeans breathing fury feared for machaon now : what if the tide turned and trojans killed the healer ?
1	the shouting of fighters soars , the clashing blare of trumpets
1	and once the god had made that great and massive shield he made achilles a breastplate brighter than gleaming fire , he made him a sturdy helmet to fit the fighter 's temples , beautiful , burnished work , and raised its golden crest and made him greaves of flexing , pliant tin
1	with those words on his lips , he gave his wife the embraces both desired , then sinking limp on her breast he courted peaceful sleep that stole throughout his body
1	all ranks held their peace
1	ajax , fiercest of all and atreus ’ two sons and the whole dolopian army , wild as a rampaging whirlwind , gusts clashing , the west- and the south- and eastwind riding high on the rushing horses of the dawn , and the woods howl and nereus , thrashing his savage trident , churns up the sea exploding in foam from its rocky depths
1	help me burn these accursed ships to ashes
1	he 's a proud man at the best of times , and now you have only plunged him deeper in his pride
1	we will fight again — i will finish you off next time if one of the gods will only urge me on as well
1	but we run counter to helenus ’ warnings not to steer between scylla and charybdis— only a razor-edge between the devil and deep blue sea— so it ’ s come about , we must swing back , when look , a northwind speeds to our rescue , sweeping south from the narrow cape of pelorus , driving us past the pantagias ’ mouth , that haven of native rock , past the bay of megara , thapsus lying low , sea-marks pointed out by achaemenides now , retracing the shores he once had coasted past as luckless ulysses ’ shipmate
1	he herded them off with his staff — they fled outside before the old man 's fury
1	how could he convoy priam clear of the ships , unseen by devoted guards who held the gates ?
1	aeneas himself , up in the lead beneath the ramparts , raises his arm and thunders out , upbraiding latinus , calling the gods : bear witness , i ’ ve been dragged into battle once again !
1	the pact ’ s already struck , its terms are set
1	she cries , poor husband , what impels you to strap that sword on now ?
1	the others listened closely and fell in line , moving out , and marshal agamemnon led them on
1	never once in his halls did he forget the gods who hold olympus , never , so now they remember him
1	i will tell it in brief
1	they singed the bristles , splaying the porkers out across hephaestus ' fire then poured the blood in cupfuls all around the corpse
1	and amidst the wall build gateways fitted strong to open a clear path for driving chariots through
1	the horses came behind as the old man cracked the lash and urged them fast throughout the city with all his kinsmen trailing
1	but once he caught her , stalking her through the onslaught , gallant tydeus ' offspring rushed her , lunging out , thrusting his sharp spear at her soft , limp wrist and the brazen point went slashing through her flesh , tearing straight through the fresh immortal robes the graces themselves had made her with their labor
1	but you , once he slashed away your life with his brazen spear he dragged you time and again around his comrade 's tomb , patroclus whom you killed — not that he brought patroclus back to life by that
1	so racked with grief for her brother he had killed she kept pounding fists on the earth that feeds us all , kept crying out to the god of death and grim persephone , flung herself on the ground , tears streaking her robes and she screamed out , 'kill meleager , kill my son !
1	or iarbas drags me off , his slave ?
1	how can you think of making all my labor worthless , all gone for nothing ?
1	perhaps you wonder how priam met his end
1	the father of men and gods complied at once
1	you glory over it too — making his wife a widow lost in the depths of their new bridal chamber , bringing his parents cursed tears and grief
1	it 's much against my will — his fury is overwhelming
1	they were the strongest mortals ever bred on earth , the strongest , and they fought against the strongest too , shaggy centaurs , wild brutes of the mountains — they hacked them down , terrible , deadly work
1	we must not loose our teams from the war-cars yet
1	approaching thetis , she caught her hand and spoke her name : thetis of flowing robes !
1	and actor 's son menoetius urging you , amy child , achilles is nobler than you with his immortal blood but you are older
1	the crowd was dazed—seven welted plies of enormous oxhide stitched in ridges of lead and iron to make them stiff
1	then , terrified by the sudden phantom , aeneas , wrenching himself from sleep , leaps up and rouses his crews and spurs them headlong on : quick !
1	oileus ' son alerted telamon 's son at once : ajax , since one of the gods who hold olympus , a god in a prophet 's shape , spurs us on to fight beside the ships — and i tell you he 's not calchas , seer of the gods who scans the flight of birds
1	i killed my last man there , i left him dead
1	and nestor the noble horseman spurred them more : what disgrace !
1	don ’ t fear the threats of war
1	vast tracts we have left a wasteland
1	they stood in a ring around the ox , took up barley and then , rising among them , king agamemnon raised his voice in prayer : zeus , zeus , god of greatness , god of glory , lord god of the dark clouds who lives in the bright sky , do not let the sun go down or the night descend on us !
1	the rest remain here too , all in strict formation , till the treasure trove is hauled forth from my tents and we can seal our binding oaths in blood
1	now , mother , go to the queen of plunder 's shrine and i will go hunt for paris , summon him to fight if the man will hear what i have to say
1	why did they raise up this giant , monstrous horse ?
1	i was killing his friends against the ships when the lord of the war cry ajax struck me down with a boulder square across my chest — he took the fight right out of me , i can tell you
1	athena luring him on with all her immortal cunning — and now , at last , as the two came closing for the kill it was tall hector , helmet flashing , who led off : no more running from you in fear , achilles !
1	but the lord of far-flung kingdoms , hero agamemnon , honored giant telamonian ajax first and last with the long savory cuts that line the backbone
