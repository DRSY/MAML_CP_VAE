begin , muse , when the two first broke and clashed , agamemnon lord of men and brilliant achilles .
what god drove them to fight with such a fury ? apollo the son of zeus and leto .
incensed at the king he swept a fatal plague through the army — men were dying and all because agamemnon spurned apollo 's priest . yes , chryses approached the achaeans ' fast ships to win his daughter back , bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand , wound on a golden staff , the wreaths of the god , the distant deadly archer .
may the gods who hold the halls of olympus give you priam 's city to plunder , then safe passage home . just set my daughter free , my dear one . here , accept these gifts , this ransom .
honor the god who strikes from worlds away — the son of zeus , apollo !
the king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears : never again , old man , let me catch sight of you by the hollow ships !
the girl — i wo n't give up the girl . long before that , old age will overtake her in my house , in argos , far from her fatherland , slaving back and forth at the loom , forced to share my bed !
now go , do n't tempt my wrath — and you may depart alive .
rage — goddess , sing the rage of peleus ' son achilles , murderous , doomed , that cost the achaeans countless losses , hurling down to the house of death so many sturdy souls , great fighters ' souls , but made their bodies carrion , feasts for the dogs and birds , and the will of zeus was moving toward its end .
god of the silver bow who strides the walls of chryse and cilia sacrosanct — lord in power of tenedos — smintheus , god of the plague ! if i ever roofed a shrine to please your heart , ever burned the long rich bones of bulls and goats on your holy altar , now , now bring my prayer to pass . pay the danaans back — your arrows for my tears !
his prayer went up and phoebus apollo heard him . down he strode from olympus ' peaks , storming at heart with his bow and hooded quiver slung across his shoulders . the arrows clanged at his back as the god quaked with rage , the god himself on the march and down he came like night .
first he went for the mules and circling dogs but then , launching a piercing shaft at the men themselves , he cut them down in droves — and the corpse-fires burned on , night and day , no end in sight .
on the tenth achilles called all ranks to muster — the impulse seized him , sent by white-armed hera grieving to see achaean fighters drop and die .
once they 'd gathered , crowding the meeting grounds , the swift runner achilles rose and spoke among them : son of atreus , now we are beaten back , i fear , the long campaign is lost . so home we sail .
but wait : let us question a holy man , a prophet , even a man skilled with dreams — dreams as well can come our way from zeus — come , someone to tell us why apollo rages so , whether he blames us for a vow we failed , or sacrifice .
if only the god would share the smoky savor of lambs and full-grown goats , apollo might be willing , still , somehow , to save us from this plague.so he proposed and down he sat again as calchas rose among them , thestor 's son , the clearest by far of all the seers who scan the flight of birds .
he knew all things that are , all things that are past and all that are to come , the seer who had led the argive ships to troy with the second sight that god apollo gave him .
you order me to explain apollo 's anger , the distant deadly archer ? i will tell it all .
but strike a pact with me , swear you will defend me with all your heart , with words and strength of hand .
for there is a man i will enrage — i see it now — a powerful man who lords it over all the argives , one the achaeans must obey .
will you save me ?
how to exalt achilles ?
what do you want ?
and i swear by apollo dear to zeus , the power you pray to , calchas , when you reveal god 's will to the argives — no one , not while i am alive and see the light on earth , no one will lay his heavy hands on you by the hollow ships .
so that day the prophet revealed the future — and now , look , by god , it all comes to pass !
the god 's enraged because agamemnon spurned his priest , he refused to free his daughter , he refused the ransom . that 's why the archer sends us pains and he will send us more and never drive this shameful destruction from the argives , not till we give back the girl with sparkling eyes to her loving father — no price , no ransom paid — and carry a sacred hundred bulls to chryse town .
then we can calm the god , and only then appease him .
so he declared and sat down .
but among them rose the fighting son of atreus , lord of the far-flung kingdoms , agamemnon — furious , his dark heart filled to the brim , blazing with anger now , his eyes like searing fire .
do as you please — but none of the deathless gods will ever praise you .
then — then you will tear your heart out , desperate , raging that you disgraced the best of the achaeans !
never a word that works to my advantage !
now , again , you divine god 's will for the armies , bruit it about , as fact , why the deadly archer multiplies our pains : because i , i refused that glittering price for the young girl chryseis .
i rank her higher than clytemnestra , my wedded wife — she 's nothing less in build or breeding , in mind or works of hand . but i am willing to give her back , even so , if that is best for all . what i really want is to keep my people safe , not see them dying .
that would be a disgrace . you are all witness , look — my prize is snatched away !
but the swift runner achilles answered him at once , just how , agamemnon , great field marshal .
most grasping man alive , how can the generous argives give you prizes now ?
no time for rest .
that 's what it is , and it will be unbearable if the two of you must come to blows this way , flinging the gods in chaos just for mortal men .
so return the girl to the god , at least for now .
we achaeans will pay you back , three , four times over , if zeus will grant us the gift , somehow , someday , to raze troy 's massive ramparts to the ground .
and you , achilles , never hope to fight it out with your king , pitting force against his force : no one can match the honors dealt a king , you know , a sceptered king to whom great zeus gives glory .
to cling to your own prize while i sit calmly by — empty-handed here ? is that why you order me to give her back ? no — if our generous argives will give me a prize , a match for my desires , equal to what i 've lost , well and good .
now come , we haul a black ship down to the bright sea , gather a decent number of oarsmen along her locks and put aboard a sacrifice , and chryseis herself , in all her beauty .
ajax , idomeneus , trusty odysseus or you , achilles , you — the most violent man alive — so you can perform the rites for us and calm the god yourself .
my honors never equal yours , whenever we sack some wealthy trojan stronghold — my arms bear the brunt of the raw , savage fighting , true , but when it comes to dividing up the plunder the lion 's share is yours , and back i go to my ships , clutching some scrap , some pittance that i love , when i have fought to exhaustion .
the trojans never did me damage , not in the least , they never stole my cattle or my horses , never in phthia where the rich soil breeds strong men did they lay waste my crops .
that fool — he rewarded all his kindness with abuse , never gave him the mares he 'd come so far to win .
let hector call you a coward , scorn your courage — the trojan and dardan troops will never believe him , nor will the wives of the lusty trojan shieldsmen , never — you flung their lords in the dust , laid them low in their prime !
we 'll fight again tomorrow — until some fatal power decides between us both , handing victory down to one side or the other .
yes , they fail to fulfill their promise sworn that day they sailed here from the stallion-land of argos : that not until you had razed the rugged walls of troy would they sail home again .
and king agamemnon took his lead , saluting : again , old man , you outfight the argives in debate !
i will never beg you to stay , not on my account .
but come , while i strap my battle-armor on , all of you pray to cronus ' son , almighty zeus .
you — i hate you most of all the warlords loved by the gods .
so much the better if i had .
i will never rise in their defense , not against you — i 'd never grudge your pleasure .
then , what 's more , if you fail to sack the city , you will know if the will of god 's to blame or the cowardice of your men — inept in battle .
first by far agamemnon lord of men sprang up and following him tydides , powerful diomedes , next the great and little ajax armed in fury , idomeneus after them and idomeneus ' good aide , meriones , a match for the butcher god of war , eurypylus after them , euaemon 's gallant son , thoas son of andraemon , odysseus out for exploit : all were roused to go up against prince hector .
as his racing spirit veered back and forth , just as he drew his huge blade from its sheath , down from the vaulting heavens swept athena , the white-armed goddess hera sped her down : hera loved both men and cared for both alike .
we embark her too .
but soon as the white-armed goddess hera saw them mauling argive units caught in the bloody press , she winged her words at pallas : what disaster !
achilles lets it go .
child of zeus with the shield of thunder , why come now ?
it 's too soon to see agamemnon 's purpose clearly .
i tell you this , and so help me it 's the truth — he 'll soon pay for his arrogance with his life !
tell me , please .
the white-armed goddess hera sped me down : she loves you both , she cares for you both alike .
do n't lay hand to sword . lash him with threats of the price that he will face . and i tell you this — and i know it is the truth — one day glittering gifts will lie before you , three times over to pay for all his outrage .
our goddess of love — i 'd swear she 's just been rousing another argive , another beauty to pant and lust for trojans , those men the goddess loves to such despair .
yielding is far better .
better for him by far . if a man obeys the gods they 're quick to hear his prayers . and with that achilles stayed his burly hand on the silver hilt and slid the huge blade back in its sheath .
cronus ' son has trapped me in madness , blinding ruin — zeus is a harsh , cruel god .
never once did you arm with the troops and go to battle or risk an ambush packed with achaea 's picked men — you lack the courage , you can see death coming .
safer by far , you find , to foray all through camp , commandeering the prize of any man who speaks against you .
you with your coward 's heart , your men dying round you !
by this , this scepter , look , that never again will put forth crown and branches , now it 's left its stump on the mountain ridge forever , nor will it sprout new green again , now the brazen ax has stripped its bark and leaves , and now the sons of achaea pass it back and forth as they hand their judgments down , upholding the honored customs whenever zeus commands — this scepter will be the mighty force behind my oath : someday , i swear , a yearning for achilles will strike achaea 's sons and all your armies !
even so , it is less the pain of the trojans still to come that weighs me down , not even of hecuba herself or king priam , or the thought that my own brothers in all their numbers , all their gallant courage , may tumble in the dust , crushed by enemies — that is nothing , nothing beside your agony when some brazen argive hales you off in tears , wrenching away your day of light and freedom !
a flash , a sudden hurl and atrides speared a champion out in front — it was prince aeneas ' comrade-in-arms deicoon , pergasus ' son the trojans prized like priam 's sons , quick as he always was to join the forward ranks .
but he kept shouting at agamemnon , spewing his abuse : still moaning and groaning , mighty atrides — why now ?
sweeter than honey from his tongue the voice flowed on and on .
two generations of mortal men he had seen go down by now , those who were born and bred with him in the old days , in pylos ' holy realm , and now he ruled the third .
but on came hector 's team in the rush-and-buck of battle , sweeping their driver hector on in fighting-fury and then and there old nestor would have died if diomedes had not marked him fast — the lord of the war cry gave a harrowing shout , trying to rouse odysseus : where are you running , the royal son of laertes , cool tactician ?
you are both younger than i , and in my time i struck up with better men than you , even you , but never once did they make light of me .
and those who held arcadia under cyllene 's peak , near aepytus ' ancient tomb where men fight hand-to-hand , men who lived in pheneos and orchomenos rife with sheep , stratia , rhipe and enispe whipped by the sudden winds , men who settled tegea , mantinea 's inviting country , men who held stymphalus , men who ruled parrhasia — the son of ancaeus led them , powerful agapenor with sixty ships in all , and aboard each vessel crowded full arcadian companies skilled in war .
fearless bellerophon killed them all .
fight this way , if the argives still obey you , then you can see which captain is a coward , which contingent too , and which is loyal , brave , since they will fight in separate formations of their own .
so now you listen too .
whatever is right for you to hear , no one , trust me , will know of it before you , neither god nor man .
her brother ares gave her the golden-bridled team .
but capaneus ' son did not forget the commands the lord of the war cry put him under .
never — others will take my side and do me honor , zeus above all , whose wisdom rules the world .
but hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer , suddenly bursting out , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
so all can reap the benefits of their king — so even mighty atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace achilles , the best of the achaeans !
but king agamemnon answered him in haste , true , old man — all you say is fit and proper — but this soldier wants to tower over the armies , he wants to rule over all , to lord it over all , give out orders to every man in sight .
and still i could never swear he 's not a god .
what if the everlasting gods have made a spearman of him ?
we all recall that moment — who could forget it ?
you 'd be the first to lash out at another — anywhere — you saw hanging back from this , this hateful war .
do n't you see ?
never again , i trust , will achilles yield to you . and i tell you this — take it to heart , i warn you — my hands will never do battle for that girl , neither with you , king , nor any man alive . you achaeans gave her , now you 've snatched her back .
but all the rest i possess beside my fast black ship — not one bit of it can you seize against my will , atrides .
but soon as his son tlepolemus came of age in heracles ' well-built palace walls the youngster abruptly killed his father 's uncle — the good soldier licymnius , already up in years — and quickly fitting ships , gathering partisans , he fled across the sea with threats of the sons and the sons ' sons of heracles breaking at his back .
agamemnon had a vessel hauled down to the sea , he picked out twenty oarsmen to man her locks , put aboard the cattle for sacrifice to the god and led chryseis in all her beauty amidships .
they scoured it off , threw scourings in the surf and sacrificed to apollo full-grown bulls and goats along the beaten shore of the fallow barren sea and savory smoke went swirling up the skies .
so the men were engaged throughout the camp . but king agamemnon would not stop the quarrel , the first threat he hurled against achilles . he called talthybius and eurybates briskly , his two heralds , ready , willing aides : go to achilles ' lodge .
listen to me .
but rouse this fellow , wo n't you ?
he sent them off with the strict order ringing in their ears . against their will the two men made their way along the breaking surf of the barren salt sea and reached the myrmidon shelters and their ships . they found him beside his lodge and black hull , seated grimly — and achilles took no joy when he saw the two approaching .
a hushed silence went through all the achaean ranks , ashamed to refuse , afraid to take his challenge .
so he advised .
good heralds of zeus and men , here , come closer .
i do n't blame you .
go , patroclus , prince , bring out the girl and hand her to them so they can take her back .
he passed them on to deipylus , a friend-in-arms he prized beyond all comrades his own age — their minds worked as one — to drive to the ships as sthenelus mounted behind his own chariot now , seized the glittering reins and whipped his team , his strong-hoofed horses ahead at breakneck speed , rearing , plunging to overtake his captain diomedes but he with his ruthless bronze was hunting aphrodite — diomedes , knowing her for the coward goddess she is , none of the mighty gods who marshal men to battle , neither athena nor enyo raider of cities , not at all .
he lacks the sense to see a day behind , a day ahead , and safeguard the achaeans battling by the ships . patroclus obeyed his great friend 's command . he led briseis in all her beauty from the lodge and handed her over to the men to take away .
reaching out his arms , again and again he prayed to his dear mother : mother !
and i was the first , mother , i urged them all , 'appease the god at once !
you do n't look right or left .
atreus ' son agamemnon , for all his far-flung kingdoms — the man disgraces me , seizes and keeps my prize , he tears her away himself !
so he prayed and the father filled with pity , seeing atrides weep .
so he wept and prayed and his noble mother heard him , seated near her father , the old man of the sea in the salt green depths . suddenly up she rose from the churning surf like mist and settling down beside him as he wept , stroked achilles gently , whispering his name , my child — why in tears ?
what sorrow has touched your heart ?
love me as you do , you ca n't persuade me now .
he broke off and anguish gripped achilles .
what should he do ?
we raided thebe once , eetion 's sacred citadel , we ravaged the place , hauled all the plunder here and the armies passed it round , share and share alike , and they chose the beauty chryseis for agamemnon .
he begged the whole achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders , atreus ' two sons , and all ranks of achaeans cried out their assent , 'respect the priest , accept the shining ransom ! but it brought no joy to the heart of agamemnon , our high and mighty king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears .
did n't we all hear his plan in secret council ?
the son of tydeus killed the two of them on the spot , he ripped the dear life out of both and left their father tears and wrenching grief .
but the old seer who knew the cause full well revealed the will of the archer god apollo .
soaring up with the clouds to the broad sweeping sky he quickly gained the gods ' stronghold , steep olympus , and settling down by the side of cronus ' great son zeus , his spirit racked with pain , ares displayed the blood , the fresh immortal blood that gushed from his wound , and burst out in a flight of self-pity : father zeus , are n't you incensed to see such violent brutal work ?
polypoetes braced for battle killed astyalus — winging his bronze spear odysseus slew pidytes bred in percote , and teucer did the same for the royal aretaon — ablerus went down too , under the flashing lance of nestor 's son antilochus , and elatus under the lord of men agamemnon 's strength — elatus lived by the banks of rippling satniois , in pedasus perched on cliffs — the hero leitus ran phylacus down to ground at a dead run and eurypylus killed melanthius outright — but menelaus lord of the war cry had caught adrestus alive .
and thetis answered , bursting into tears , o my son , my sorrow , why did i ever bear you ?
why so much grief for me ?
not even if you mean agamemnon here who now claims to be , by far , the best of the achaeans.the seer took heart and this time he spoke out , bravely : beware — he casts no blame for a vow we failed , a sacrifice .
and so i will try to tell you something .
if only we , we gods who defend the argives had the will to hurl the trojans back and hold off thundering zeus — there he would sit and smolder , throned in desolate splendor up on ida .
no one at all to fear .
that day the olympians tried to chain him down , hera , poseidon lord of the sea , and pallas athena — you rushed to zeus , dear goddess , broke those chains , quickly ordered the hundred-hander to steep olympus , that monster whom the immortals call briareus
but in twelve days the father returns to olympus .
with that vow his mother went away and left him there , alone , his heart inflamed for the sashed and lovely girl they 'd wrenched away from him against his will .
meanwhile odysseus drew in close to chryse island , bearing the splendid sacrifice in the vessel 's hold .
and once they had entered the harbor deep in bays they furled and stowed the sail in the black ship , they lowered the mast by the forestays , smoothly , quickly let it down on the forked mast-crutch and rowed her into a mooring under oars .
out went the bow-stones — cables fast astern — and the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf , leading out the sacrifice for the archer god apollo , and out of the deep-sea ship chryseis stepped too .
then tactful odysseus led her up to the altar , placing her in her loving father 's arms , and said , chryses , the lord of men agamemnon sent me here to bring your daughter back and perform a sacrifice , a grand sacrifice to apollo — for all achaea 's sake — so we can appease the god who 's loosed such grief and torment on the argives .
that man is atreus ' son agamemnon , lord of empires , both a mighty king and a strong spearman too , and he used to be my kinsman , whore that i am !
so then , when those terrible , monstrous omens burst in on the victims we were offering to the gods , calchas swiftly revealed the will of zeus : 'why struck dumb now , my long-haired achaeans ?
at once the men arranged the sacrifice for apollo , making the cattle ring his well-built altar , then they rinsed their hands and took up barley .
god of the silver bow who strides the walls of chryse and cilla sacrosanct — lord in power of tenedos !
hector , i urge you first of all — do as i tell you .
if you honored me last time and heard my prayer and rained destruction down on all achaea 's ranks , now bring my prayer to pass once more .
his prayer went up and phoebus apollo heard him .
and soon as the men had prayed and flung the barley , first they lifted back the heads of the victims , slit their throats , skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat , a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh .
and the old man burned these over dried split wood and over the quarters poured out glistening wine while young men at his side held five-pronged forks . once they had burned the bones and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire .
when they had put aside desire for food and drink , the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all . and all day long they appeased the god with song , raising a ringing hymn to the distant archer god who drives away the plague , those young achaean warriors singing out his power , and apollo listened , his great heart warm with joy .
then when the sun went down and night came on they made their beds and slept by the stern-cables .
but now as the twelfth dawn after this shone clear the gods who live forever marched home to olympus , all in a long cortege , and zeus led them on .
the archer sent them a bracing following wind , they stepped the mast , spread white sails wide , the wind hit full and the canvas bellied out and a dark blue wave , foaming up at the bow , sang out loud and strong as the ship made way , skimming the whitecaps , cutting toward her goal . and once offshore of achaea 's vast encampment they eased her in and hauled the black ship high , far up on the sand , and shored her up with timbers . then they scattered , each to his own ship and shelter .
now he no longer haunted the meeting grounds where men win glory , now he no longer went to war but day after day he ground his heart out , waiting there , yearning , always yearning for battle cries and combat .
and thetis did not forget her son 's appeals . she broke from a cresting wave at first light and soaring up to the broad sky and mount olympus , found the son of cronus gazing down on the world , peaks apart from the other gods and seated high on the topmost crown of rugged ridged olympus .
she sat in silence .
and crouching down at his feet , quickly grasping his knees with her left hand , her right hand holding him underneath the chin , she prayed to the lord god zeus , the son of cronus : zeus , father zeus ! if i ever served you well among the deathless gods with a word or action , bring this prayer to pass : honor my son achilles !
and now the lord of men agamemnon has disgraced him , seizes and keeps his prize , tears her away himself .
but you — exalt him , olympian zeus : your urgings rule the world !
now the trojans .
then , yes , when the king could see the man 's power at last , a true son of the gods , he pressed him hard to stay , he offered his own daughter 's hand in marriage , he gave him half his royal honors as the king .
those two alone , athena and hera , sat apart from zeus — not a word would they send his way , not a question .
but thetis , clasping his knees , held on , clinging , pressing her question once again : grant my prayer , once and for all .
nothing i said was meant in earnest — trust me , i mean you all the good will in the world .
she will provoke me , she with her shrill abuse . even now in the face of all the immortal gods she harries me perpetually , hera charges me that i always go to battle for the trojans .
i will bring it all to pass .
look , i will bow my head if that will satisfy you .
that , i remind you , that among the immortal gods is the strongest , truest sign that i can give .
no word or work of mine — nothing can be revoked , there is no treachery , nothing left unfinished once i bow my head to say it shall be done .
and zeus the son of cronus bowed his craggy dark brows and the deathless locks came pouring down from the thunderhead of the great immortal king and giant shock waves spread through all olympus .
so the two of them made their pact and parted . deep in the sea she dove from radiant mount olympus . zeus went back to his own halls , and all the gods in full assembly rose from their seats at once to meet the father striding toward them now .
but hera knew it all . she had seen how thetis , the old man of the sea 's daughter , thetis quick on her glistening feet was hatching plans with zeus .
you never deign , do you , freely and frankly , to share your plots with me — never , not a word !
you 'll never persuade me .
the father of men and gods replied sharply , hera — stop hoping to fathom all my thoughts .
so , father , at least fulfill this prayer for me : let the men escape with their lives if nothing else — do n't let these trojans mow us down in droves !
and hera the queen , her dark eyes wide , exclaimed , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
one more thing — take it to heart , i urge you .
but now i have a terrible fear that she has won you over , thetis , the old man of the sea 's daughter , thetis with her glistening feet . i know it .
just at dawn she knelt down beside you and grasped your knees and i suspect you bowed your head in assent to her — you granted once and for all to exalt achilles now and slaughter hordes of achaeans pinned against their ships .
ah but tell me , hera , just what can you do about all this ? only estrange yourself from me a little more — and all the worse for you . if what you say is true , that must be my pleasure .
now go sit down .
but i with my courage , my hands , never conquered — for all their force not all the gods on olympus heights could ever turn me back .
the goddesses themselves sat down on golden settles , mixing with the immortals , athena and hera 's hearts within them dashed .
she flashed the word in helenus ' mantic spirit — the son of priam sensed what pleased the immortals hatching instant plans , and coming up to hector advised him quickly , hector , son of priam , a mastermind like zeus , listen to me now — let your brother guide you .
not overly tired , i trust , from all your efforts there in glorious battle , slaughtering trojans , the men you break with all your deathless rage .
a busy , willing servant answered quickly , hector , seeing you want to know the truth , she has n't gone to your sisters , brothers ' wives or athena 's shrine where the noble trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over .
the olympian lord of lightning — what if he would like to blast us from our seats ? he is far too strong . go back to him , mother , stroke the father with soft , winning words — at once the olympian will turn kind to us again .
pleading , springing up with a two-handled cup , he reached it toward his loving mother 's hands with his own winning words : patience , mother !
you have your mother 's uncontrollable rage — incorrigible , that hera — say what i will , i can hardly keep her down .
grieved as you are , bear up , or dear as you are , i have to see you beaten right before my eyes .
it 's hard to fight the olympian strength for strength .
and any god i catch , breaking ranks with us , eager to go and help the trojans or achaeans — back he comes to olympus , whipped by the lightning , eternally disgraced .
the rest of them ?
so he urged and the white-armed goddess hera obeyed at once .
then dipping sweet nectar up from the mixing bowl he poured it round to all the immortals , left to right . and uncontrollable laughter broke from the happy gods as they watched the god of fire breathing hard and bustling through the halls .
none of them knew it , each denied the mark .
at last , when the sun 's fiery light had set , each immortal went to rest in his own house , the splendid high halls hephaestus built for each with all his craft and cunning , the famous crippled smith .
and olympian zeus the lord of lightning went to his own bed where he had always lain when welcome sleep came on him . there he climbed and there he slept and by his side lay hera the queen , the goddess of the golden throne .
as his spirit churned , at last one plan seemed best : he would send a murderous dream to agamemnon . calling out to the vision , zeus winged it on : go , murderous dream , to the fast achaean ships and once you reach agamemnon 's shelter rouse him , order him , word-for-word , exactly as i command .
in the face of blissful gods and mortal men , in the face of that unbending , ruthless king — if the day should come when the armies need me to save their ranks from ignominious , stark defeat .
tell atrides to arm his long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now he can take the broad streets of troy .
the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs are about to crush the men of troy .
capaneus ' good son sthenelus saw them coming and quickly alerted diomedes , warnings flying : tydides , joy of my heart , dear comrade , look !
down through the bracing godsent night it came like good nestor in features , height and build , the old king himself , and hovering at my head the dream called me on : 'still asleep , agamemnon ?
hovering at his head the vision rose like nestor , neleus ' son , the chief agamemnon honored most .
the son of atreus , that skilled breaker of horses ? how can you sleep all night , a man weighed down with duties ? your armies turning over their lives to your command — responsibilities so heavy .
zeus commands you to arm your long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now you can take the broad streets of troy ! the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs from zeus are about to crush the men of troy !
hera 's urgings , i trust , have made you suffer this .
you could hear some trojan or achaean calling , zeus — god of greatness , god of glory , all you immortals !
that 's all i 'd ask .
remember — let no loss of memory overcome you when the sweet grip of slumber sets you free .
with that the dream departed , leaving him there , his heart racing with hopes that would not come to pass .
he thought he would take the city of priam then , that very day , the fool .
never — even if zeus 's wrath does not strike home at once , he 'll strike in his own good time with greater fury .
inspired with nestor 's voice and sent by zeus , the dream cried out , still asleep , agamemnon ?
then over his shoulder paris slung his sword , the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt , and then the shield-strap and his sturdy , massive shield and over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet , the horsehair crest atop it tossing , bristling terror , and last he grasped a spear that matched his grip .
now the goddess dawn climbed up to olympus heights , declaring the light of day to zeus and the deathless gods as the king commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and muster the long-haired achaeans to full assembly .
nireus led his three trim ships from syme , nireus the son of aglaea and king charopus , nireus the handsomest man who ever came to troy , of all the achaeans after peleus ' fearless son .
and suddenly hera taunted the father , son of cronus : so , who of the gods this time , my treacherous one , was hatching plans with you ?
listen to me , quickly !
at that command the dream went winging off , and passing quickly along the fast trim ships , made for the king and found him soon , sound asleep in his tent with refreshing godsent slumber drifted round him .
but once the sun stood striding at high noon , then father zeus held out his sacred golden scales : in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low — one for the trojan horsemen , one for argives armed in bronze — and gripping the beam mid-haft the father raised it high and down went achaea 's day of doom , achaea 's fate settling down on the earth that feeds us all as the fate of troy went lifting toward the sky .
now the great array of gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long , but the peaceful grip of sleep could not hold zeus , turning it over in his mind .
but about your question — yes , i have the answer .
zeus commands you to arm your long-haired achaeans , to attack at once , full force — now you can take the broad streets of troy !
the immortal gods who hold olympus clash no more , hera 's appeals have brought them round and all agree : griefs from zeus are about to crush the men of troy !
i 've learned it all too well .
with that the dream went winging off and soothing sleep released me .
come , let us keep clear of each other 's spears , even there in the thick of battle .
but first , according to time-honored custom , i will test the men with a challenge , tell them all to crowd the oarlocks , cut and run in their ships .
but you take up your battle-stations at every point , command them , hold them back .
noble nestor the king of pylos ' sandy harbor spoke and urged them on with all good will : friends , lords of the argives , o my captains !
if any other achaean had told us of this dream we 'd call it false and turn our backs upon it .
it 's obvious — any fool can see it .
but look , the man who saw it has every claim to be the best , the bravest achaean we can field .
listen to nestor .
and out he marched , leading the way from council .
rank and file streamed behind and rushed like swarms of bees pouring out of a rocky hollow , burst on endless burst , bunched in clusters seething over the first spring blooms , dark hordes swirling into the air , this way , that way — so the many armed platoons from the ships and tents came marching on , close-file , along the deep wide beach to crowd the meeting grounds , and rumor , zeus 's crier , like wildfire blazing among them , whipped them on .
nine heralds shouted out , trying to keep some order , quiet , battalions , silence !
then atreus ' son agamemnon stood in behalf of all , lifted his arms and prayed in his deep resounding voice , father zeus !
so great ajax vaunted and men prayed to the son of cronus , king zeus .
at the same time zeus the father whipped his team and hurtling chariot straight from ida to mount olympus , soon to reach the sessions of the gods .
all the achaean soldiers roared out their assent , stirred by the stallion-breaking lord 's reply , and king agamemnon rounded on idaeus : there , there 's the achaeans ' answer , idaeus — a declaration — you can hear for yourself .
i 'm wounded , the pain 's too much , a mortal 's speared me — that daredevil diomedes , he 'd fight father zeus !
true , they 've labored long — they 're desperate for home .
but now , i see , he only plotted brutal treachery : now he commands me back to argos in disgrace , whole regiments of my men destroyed in battle .
we 'll set all this to rights , someday , if zeus will ever let us raise the winebowl of freedom high in our halls , high to the gods of cloud and sky who live forever — once we drive these argives geared for battle out of troy !
say that trojans and argives both agreed to swear a truce , to seal their oaths in blood , and opposing sides were tallied out in full : count one by one the trojans who live in troy but count our achaeans out by ten-man squads and each squad pick a trojan to pour its wine — many achaean tens would lack their steward then !
armies of allies crowd the mighty city of priam , true , but they speak a thousand different tongues , fighters gathered here from all ends of the realm .
but they have allies called from countless cities , fighters brandishing spears who block my way , who throw me far off course , thwarting my will to plunder ilium 's rugged walls .
for i must go home to see my people first , to visit my own dear wife and my baby son .
you know it all so well .
home we go in our ships !
we 'll never take the broad streets of troy .
king agamemnon 's hour .
chiefs of the argives armed in bronze , no orders for you — it 's wrong to incite you two , you lead your men to war in so much force .
and the whole assembly surged like big waves at sea , the icarian sea when east and south winds drive it on , blasting down in force from the clouds of father zeus , or when the west wind shakes the deep standing grain with hurricane gusts that flatten down the stalks — so the massed assembly of troops was shaken now .
now with the squadrons marshaled , captains leading each , the trojans came with cries and the din of war like wildfowl when the long hoarse cries of cranes sweep on against the sky and the great formations flee from winter 's grim ungodly storms , flying in force , shrieking south to the ocean gulfs , speeding blood and death to the pygmy warriors , launching at daybreak savage battle down upon their heads .
and now they might have won their journey home , the men of argos fighting the will of fate , yes , if hera had not alerted athena : inconceivable !
then promise to sacrifice twelve heifers in her shrine , yearlings never broken , if only she 'll pity troy , the trojan wives and all our helpless children , if only she 'll hold diomedes back from the holy city — that wild spearman , that invincible headlong terror !
come now , just wait till these long-haired achaeans sail back in their ships to the fatherland they love , then batter their wall , sweep it into the salt breakers and pile over the endless beach your drifts of sand again , level it to your heart 's content — the argives ' mighty wall .
so atrides demanded .
down she flashed from the peaks of mount olympus , quickly reached the ships and found odysseus first , a mastermind like zeus , still standing fast .
he had not laid a hand on his black benched hull , such anguish racked his heart and fighting spirit .
odysseus struck democoon , priam 's bastard son come down from abydos , priam 's racing-stables .
both men bent on combat , on they fought like wind when a god sends down some welcome blast to sailors desperate for it , worked to death at the polished oars , beating the heavy seas , their arms slack with the labor — so welcome that brace of men appeared to the trojans desperate for their captains .
ca n't you see ?
with your winning words hold back each man you find — do n't let them haul their rolling ships to sea !
he fired them so the armies roared and the ships resounded round them , shattering echoes ringing from their shouts as argives cried assent to king odysseus ' words .
lord agamemnon rose at once to greet them both with the great tactician odysseus by his side .
but the known cowards he drove amidst the center : a man might cringe but he 'd be forced to fight .
forget the orders — nothing to fear , my friend , neither ares nor any other god .
and lead on priam too , priam in all his power , so the king himself can seal our truce in blood — his royal sons are reckless , not to be trusted : no one must trample on the oath we swear to zeus .
and now as the high gods bantered back and forth diomedes , loosing his war cry , charged aeneas — though what he saw was lord apollo himself , guarding , spreading his arms above the fighter , but even before the mighty god he would not flinch .
whenever odysseus met some man of rank , a king , he 'd halt and hold him back with winning words : my friend — it 's wrong to threaten you like a coward , but you stand fast , you keep your men in check !
obey the commands of others , your superiors — you , you deserter , rank coward , you count for nothing , neither in war nor council .
you wo n't last long , i 'd say — now the glory 's mine !
no one can rout me — his will against my will — not by force , god knows , and not by a sly maneuver either .
versatile odysseus took the helm as captain .
so he ranged the ranks , commanding men to order — and back again they surged from ships and shelters , back to the meeting grounds with a deep pounding din , thundering out as battle lines of breakers crash and drag along some endless beach , and the rough sea roars .
when hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man 's land along his lines he strode , gripping his spear mid-haft , staving men to a standstill while agamemnon seated his argives geared for combat .
leaving priam and all the men of troy a trophy to glory over , helen of argos , helen for whom so many argives lost their lives in troy , far from native land .
achilles despised him most , odysseus too — he was always abusing both chiefs , but now he went for majestic agamemnon , hollering out , taunting the king with strings of cutting insults .
the achaeans were furious with him , deeply offended .
when up rushed agamemnon , blocking his way and shouting out , so soft , dear brother , why ?
my father , tydeus , i really do n't remember .
but soon her father , the holy priest of apollo the distant deadly archer , chryses approached the fast trim ships of the argives armed in bronze to win his daughter back , bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand , wound on a golden staff , the wreaths of the god who strikes from worlds away .
but he bore a son who 's not the half of him in battle — better only in wrangling , wars of words !
but the lawful wife of menelaus , renowned menelaus , he will not give her up , paris makes that clear , though all troy commands him to do precisely that .
look — now it 's achilles , a greater man he disgraces , seizes and keeps his prize , tears her away himself .
zeus knows , no doubt , and every immortal too , which fighter is doomed to end all this in death .
if not , atrides , that outrage would have been your last !
and atreus ' son himself , powerful agamemnon seized your right hand , shouting out your name : you 're mad , my prince !
but the gods wo n't give us all their gifts at once .
now tell me , muse , who were the bravest of them all , of the men and chariot-teams that came with atreus ' sons ?
i have no mind to linger here disgraced , brimming your cup and piling up your plunder .
i tell you this , so help me it 's the truth : if i catch you again , blithering on this way , let odysseus ' head be wrenched off his shoulders , never again call me the father of telemachus if i do n't grab you , strip the clothing off you , cloak , tunic and rags that wrap your private parts , and whip you howling naked back to the fast ships , out of the armies ' muster — whip you like a cur !
incensed for the dead odysseus speared him straight through one temple and out the other punched the sharp bronze point and the dark came swirling thick across his eyes — down he crashed , armor clanging against his chest .
rubbing his tears off dumbly with a fist .
the rascal doubled over , tears streaking his face and a bloody welt bulged up between his blades , under the stroke of the golden scepter 's studs .
he squatted low , cringing , stunned with pain , blinking like some idiot .
once in the past he came our way , king odysseus heading the embassy they sent for your release , together with menelaus dear to ares .
and despite the god 's undying lust for battle ares might have wasted away there on the spot if the monsters ' stepmother , beautiful eriboea had not sent for hermes , and out of the cauldron hermes stole him away — the war-god breathing his last , all but broken down by the ruthless iron chains .
enraged at his friend 's death odysseus sprang in fury , helmed in fiery bronze he plowed through the front and charging the enemy , glaring left and right he hurled his spear — a glinting brazen streak — and the trojans gave ground , scattering back , panicking there before his whirling shaft — a direct hit !
but odysseus stepped in quickly , faced him down with a dark glance and threats to break his nerve : what a flood of abuse , thersites !
now , my king , the achaeans are bent on making you a disgrace in the eyes of every man alive .
never has longing for you overwhelmed me so , no , not even then , i tell you , that first time when i swept you up from the lovely hills of lacedaemon , sailed you off and away in the racing deep-sea ships and we went and locked in love on rocky island .
but look at them now , like green , defenseless boys or widowed women whimpering to each other , wailing to journey back .
so now let diomedes , powerful as he is , be on his guard for fear a better soldier than you engage him — for fear his wife , aegialia , adrastus ' daughter , for all her self-control , will wail through the nights and wake her beloved servants out of sleep .
this is the ninth year come round , the ninth we 've hung on here .
it 's not some lifeless fear that paralyzes me now , no flinching from combat either .
we were all busy then , milling round a spring and offering victims up on the holy altars , full sacrifice to the gods to guarantee success , under a spreading plane tree where the water splashed , glittering in the sun — when a great omen appeared .
he slid from under the altar , glided up the tree and there the brood of a sparrow , helpless young ones , teetered high on the topmost branch-tips , cowering under the leaves there , eight they were all told and the mother made the ninth , she 'd borne them all — chirping to break the heart but the snake gulped them down and the mother cried out for her babies , fluttering over him .
the deathless aphrodite sank in dione 's lap and her mother , folding her daughter in her arms , stroked her gently , whispered her name and asked , who has abused you now , dear child , tell me , who of the sons of heaven so unfeeling , cruel ?
but once he 'd swallowed down the sparrow with her brood , the son of crooked cronus who sent the serpent forth turned him into a sign , a monument clear to see — zeus struck him to stone !
just look at the maniac , born for disaster , double-dealing , lying two-faced god — just now he promised me and hera , the war-god swore he 'd fight the trojans , stand behind the argives .
the earth groaned and rumbled under the huge weight as soldiers took positions — the whole place in uproar .
and nestor the noble horseman spurred them more : what disgrace !
no baby boy still in his mother 's belly , not even he escape — all ilium blotted out , no tears for their lives , no markers for their graves !
into the flames with councils , all the plans of men , the vows sealed with the strong , unmixed wine , the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted !
we — your allies here — we do your fighting for you .
but the two of you will never quit this fight , i 'd say , till one of you drops and dies and gluts with blood ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield !
zeus the son of almighty cronus , i remind you , bowed his head that day we boarded ship , all the argives laden with blood and death for troy — his lightning bolts on the right , good omens blazing forth .
so now let no man hurry to sail for home , not yet . not till he beds down with a faithful trojan wife , payment in full for the groans and shocks of war we have all borne for helen . but any soldier wild with desire to reach his home at once — just let him lay a hand on his black benched ship and right in front of the rest he 'll reach his death !
reveal the will of god , whatever you may know .
turn them back , do n't let them engage me here .
range your men by tribes , even by clans , agamemnon , so clan fights by the side of clan , tribe by tribe .
but if you love hector , if you hold him dear , at least give both men equal strength and glory .
they tell me to add this too , a good sound proposal : if you are willing , come , we 'll halt the brutal war until we can burn the bodies of our dead .
grant this boy , my son , may be like me , first in glory among the trojans , strong and brave like me , and rule all troy in power and one day let them say , 'he is a better man than his father !
father zeus , athena , apollo , if all my fighters had such courage pounding inside their chests , we 'd bring king priam 's citadel crashing down in an instant , sacked at our hands — annihilated .
it 's your own command still ringing in my ears , forbidding me to fight the immortals head-on , all but one of the blessed gods , that is — if aphrodite daughter of zeus slips into battle , she 's the one to stab with my sharp bronze spear .
ah if the two of us could ever think as one , troy could delay her day of death no longer , not one moment .
go now , take your meal — the sooner to bring on war .
and we all must battle you — you brought that senseless daughter into the world , that murderous curse — forever bent on crimes !
no breathing space , no letup , not a moment , not till the night comes on to part the fighters ' fury !
now sweat will soak the shield-strap round your chest , your fist gripping the spear will ache with tensing , now the lather will drench your war-team 's flanks , hauling your sturdy chariot .
but achilles rounded on agamemnon once again , lashing out at him , not relaxing his anger for a moment : staggering drunk , with your dog 's eyes , your fawn 's heart !
so he commanded and the armies gave a deep resounding roar like waves crashing against a cliff when the south wind whips it , bearing down , some craggy headland jutting out to sea — the waves will never leave it in peace , thrashed by gales that hit from every quarter , breakers left and right .
the troops sprang up , scattered back to the ships , lit fires beside their tents and took their meal .
but the lord of men agamemnon sacrificed a fat rich ox , five years old , to the son of mighty cronus , zeus , and called the chiefs of all the argive forces : nestor first and foremost , then king idomeneus , the great and little ajax , tydeus ' son diomedes and odysseus sixth , a mastermind like zeus .
no one , i say — no one alive less soldierly than you , none in the ranks that came to troy with agamemnon .
he killed eetion , not that he stripped his gear — he 'd some respect at least — for he burned his corpse in all his blazoned bronze , then heaped a grave-mound high above the ashes and nymphs of the mountain planted elms around it , daughters of zeus whose shield is storm and thunder .
so he decreed .
and so agamemnon prayed but the son of cronus would not bring his prayer to pass , not yet .
once the men had prayed and flung the barley , first they lifted back the heads of the victims , slit their throats , skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat , a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh .
and they burned these on a cleft stick , peeled and dry , spitted the vitals , held them over hephaestus ' flames and once they 'd charred the thighs and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire .
they skinned the animal quickly , butchered the carcass , expertly cut the meat into pieces , pierced them with spits , roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire .
when they had put aside desire for food and drink , nestor the noble old horseman spoke out first : marshal atrides , lord of men agamemnon , no more trading speeches now .
just for the sake of rivalry , soldier 's pride , do n't rush to fight with a better man , with hector the son of priam .
and all the while they worked over menelaus whose cry could marshal armies , on the trojans came , columns armed for assault , and again the argives donned their gear and roused their lust for war .
he commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and summon the long-haired achaean troops to battle .
out with it now , calchas .
the troops assembled .
the warlords dear to the gods and flanking agamemnon strode on ahead , marshaling men-at-arms in files , and down their ranks the fiery-eyed athena bore her awesome shield of storm , ageless , deathless — a hundred golden tassels , all of them braided tight and each worth a hundred oxen , float along the front .
and once you 've roused our lines to the last man , we 'll hold out here and fight the argives down , hard-hit as we are — necessity drives us on .
now , suddenly , battle thrilled them more than the journey home , than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land .
as ravening fire rips through big stands of timber high on a mountain ridge and the blaze flares miles away , so from the marching troops the blaze of bronze armor , splendid and superhuman , flared across the earth , flashing into the air to hit the skies .
as a stallion full-fed at the manger , stalled too long , breaking free of his tether gallops down the plain , out for his favorite plunge in a river 's cool currents , thundering in his pride — his head flung back , his mane streaming over his shoulders , sure and sleek in his glory , knees racing him on to the fields and stallion-haunts he loves — so down from pergamus heights came paris , son of priam , glittering in his armor like the sun astride the skies , exultant , laughing aloud , his fast feet sped him on .
crowding thick-and-fast as the swarms of flies seething over the shepherds ' stalls in the first spring days when the buckets flood with milk — so many long-haired achaeans swarmed across the plain to confront the trojans , fired to smash their lines .
the armies grouping now — as seasoned goatherds split their wide-ranging flocks into packs with ease when herds have mixed together down the pasture : so the captains formed their tight platoons , detaching right and left , moving up for action — and there in the midst strode powerful agamemnon , eyes and head like zeus who loves the lightning , great in the girth like ares , god of battles , broad through the chest like sea lord poseidon .
they stood in a ring around the ox , took up barley and then , rising among them , king agamemnon raised his voice in prayer : zeus , zeus , god of greatness , god of glory , lord god of the dark clouds who lives in the bright sky , do n't let the sun go down or the night descend on us !
you are goddesses , you are everywhere , you know all things — all we hear is the distant ring of glory , we know nothing — who were the captains of achaea ?
you have done nothing to me .
the mass of troops i could never tally , never name , not even if i had ten tongues and ten mouths , a tireless voice and the heart inside me bronze , never unless you muses of olympus , daughters of zeus whose shield is rolling thunder , sing , sing in memory all who gathered under troy .
now i can only tell the lords of the ships , the ships in all their numbers !
first came the boeotian units led by leitus and peneleos : arcesilaus and prothoenor and clonius shared command of the armed men who lived in hyria , rocky aulis , schoenus , scolus and eteonus spurred with hills , thespia and graea , the dancing rings of mycalessus , men who lived round harma , ilesion and erythrae and those who settled eleon , hyle and peteon , ocalea , medeon 's fortress walled and strong , copae , eutresis and thisbe thronged with doves , fighters from coronea , haliartus deep in meadows , and the men who held plataea and lived in glisas , men who held the rough-hewn gates of lower thebes , onchestus the holy , poseidon 's sun-filled grove , men from the town of arne green with vineyards , midea and sacred nisa , anthedon-on-the-marches .
they came in a hundred ships and agamemnon led them on , atreus ' royal son , and marching in his companies came the most and bravest fighting men by far .
and deep within its walls were fifty sleeping chambers masoned in smooth , lustrous ashlar , linked in a line where the sons of priam slept beside their wedded wives , and facing these , opening out across the inner courtyard , lay the twelve sleeping chambers of priam 's daughters , masoned and roofed in lustrous ashlar , linked in a line where the sons-in-law of priam slept beside their wives .
then schedius and epistrophus led the men of phocis — two sons of iphitus , that great heart , naubolus ' son — the men who held cyparissus and pytho 's high crags , the hallowed earth of crisa , daulis and panopeus , men who dwelled round anemoria , round hyampolis , men who lived along the cephisus ' glinting waters , men who held lilaea close to the river 's wellsprings .
under podarces sailed their forty long black ships .
next the locrians led by racing ajax , son of oileus , little ajax — a far cry from the size of telamonian ajax — a smaller man but trim in his skintight linen corslet , he outthrew all hellenes , all achaeans with his spear .
in oilean ajax ' charge came forty long black ships , locrians living across the straits from sacrosanct euboea .
then ocean men from dulichion and the holy islands , the echinades rising over the sea across from elis — meges a match for ares led their troops to war , a son of the rider phyleus dear to zeus who once , enraged at his father , fled and settled dulichion .
the sprinting abantes followed hard at his heels , their forelocks cropped , hair grown long at the back , troops nerved to lunge with their tough ashen spears and slash the enemies ' breastplates round their chests .
and while they prayed to the daughter of mighty zeus hector approached the halls of paris , sumptuous halls he built himself with the finest masons of the day , master builders famed in the fertile land of troy .
zeus 's daughter athena tended him once the grain-giving fields had borne him , long ago , and then she settled the king in athens , in her own rich shrine , where sons of athens worship him with bulls and goats as the years wheel round in season .
athenians all , and peteos ' son menestheus led them on , and no one born on the earth could match that man in arraying teams of horse and shielded fighters — nestor his only rival , thanks to nestor 's age .
out of salamis great telamonian ajax led twelve ships drawn up where athenian forces formed their line of battle .
then men of argos and tiryns with her tremendous walls and hermione and asine commanding the deep wide gulf , troezen , eionae and epidaurus green with vines and achaea 's warrior sons who held aegina and mases — diomedes lord of the war cry led their crack contingents flanked by sthenelus , far-famed capaneus ' favorite son .
elephenor , comrade of ares , led the whole contingent , chalcodon 's son , a lord of the fierce abantes .
and in their command sailed eighty long black ships .
and heracles ' son tlepolemus tall and staunch led nine ships of the proud rhodians out of rhodes , the men who lived on rhodes in three island divisions , lindos and ialysus and camirus ' white escarpment , armies led by the famous spearman tlepolemus whom astyochea bore to heracles filled with power .
next those who held lacedaemon 's hollows deep with gorges , pharis , sparta and messe , crowded haunt of the wild doves , men who lived in brysiae and augeae 's gracious country , men who held amyclae , helos the seaboard fortress , men who settled laas and lived near oetylus : agamemnon 's brother , menelaus lord of the war cry led their sixty ships , armed them apart , downshore , and amidst their ranks he marched , ablaze with valor , priming men for attack .
and his own heart blazed the most to avenge the groans and shocks of war they 'd borne for helen .
next the men who lived in pylos and handsome arene , thryon , the alpheus ford and finely-masoned aepy , men who lived in cyparisseis and amphigenia , pteleos , helos and dorion where the muses met the thracian thamyris , stopped the minstrel 's song .
meriones killed phereclus — son of tecton , son of the blacksmith harmon — the fighter 's hands had the skill to craft all kinds of complex work since pallas athena loved him most , her protege who had built paris his steady , balanced ships , trim launchers of death , freighted with death for all of troy and now for the shipwright too : what could the man know of all the gods ' decrees ?
and the men who held the land of apaesus and adrestia , men who held pityea , terea 's steep peaks — the units led by adrestus joined by amphius trim in linen corslet , the two good sons of merops out of percote harbor , merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts .
agamemnon himself , the lord of men had given them those well-benched ships to plow the wine-dark sea , since works of the sea meant nothing to those landsmen .
then men who lived in methone and thaumacia , men who held meliboea and rugged ridged olizon : philoctetes the master archer had led them on in seven ships with fifty oarsmen aboard each , superbly skilled with the bow in lethal combat .
hippothous and pylaeus , tested soldier , led them on , both sons of pelasgian lethus , teutamus ' scion .
strong diores the son of amarynceus led the third and the princely polyxinus led the fourth , the son of king agasthenes , augeas ' noble stock .
and the men who lived around percote and practios , men who settled sestos , abydos and gleaming arisbe : asius son of hyrtacus led them on , captain of armies , hyrtacus ' offspring asius — hulking , fiery stallions bore him in from arisbe , from the selleis river .
that 's when the fury gripped the son of atreus .
let him lead off .
in his command sailed forty long black ships .
next odysseus led his cephallenian companies , gallant-hearted fighters , the island men of ithaca , of mount neriton 's leafy ridges shimmering in the wind , and men who lived in crocylia and rugged aegilips , men who held zacynthus and men who dwelled near samos and mainland men who grazed their flocks across the channel .
and thoas son of andraemon led aetolia 's units , soldiers who lived in pleuron , pylene and olenus , chalcis along the shore and calydon 's rocky heights where the sons of wellborn oeneus were no more and the king himself was dead and meleager with his golden hair was gone .
in thoas ' command sailed forty long black ships .
and the great spearman idomeneus led his cretans , the men who held cnossos and gortyn ringed in walls , lyctos , miletus , lycastus ' bright chalk bluffs , phaestos and rhytion , cities a joy to live in — the men who peopled crete , a hundred cities strong .
the renowned spearman idomeneus led them all in force with meriones who butchered men like the god of war himself .
in their command sailed forty curved black ships .
down the goddess swept from olympus ' craggy peaks and dove like a star the son of cronus flings , cronus with all his turning , twisting ways — a sign to men at sea or a massive army marching , blazing on with a stream of sparks showering in its wake .
diomedes killed off axylus , teuthras ' son who had lived in rock-built arisbe , a man of means and a friend to all mankind , at his roadside house he 'd warm all comers in .
the men were forced to their seats , marshaled into ranks , the shouting died away .
but he reached rhodes at last , a wanderer rocked by storms , and there they settled in three divisions , all by tribes , loved by zeus himself the king of gods and mortals showering wondrous gold on all their heads .
and he left them there , dead , and he made a rush at abas and polyidus , sons of eurydamas , an aged reader of dreams , but the old prophet read no dreams for them when they set out for troy — diomedes laid them low then swung to attack the two sons of phaenops , hardy xanthus and thoon , both men grown tall as their father shrank away with wasting age .
and men who held nisyrus , casus and crapathus , cos , eurypylus ' town , and the islands called calydnae — combat troops , and antiphus and phidippus led them on , the two sons of the warlord thessalus , heracles ' son .
in their command sailed thirty long curved ships .
and now , muse , sing all those fighting men who lived in pelasgian argos , the big contingents out of alus and alope and trachis , men of phthia and hellas where the women are a wonder , all the fighters called achaeans , hellenes and myrmidons ranked in fifty ships , and achilles was their leader .
but in days to come do n't let this quarrel breed some towering clash between us both , pitting you and me in conflict .
the troops themselves had no fear , no dread of the trojans ' power and breakneck charges , no , they stood their ground like heavy thunderheads stacked up on the towering mountaintops by cronus ' son , stock-still in a windless calm when the raging north wind and his gusty ripping friends that had screamed down to rout dark clouds have fallen dead asleep .
perhaps he will be persuaded .
teuthras first , orestes lasher of stallions next , an aetolian spearman trechus , oenomaus and helenus , oenops ' son , and oresbius cinched with shining belt who had lived in hyle hoarding his great wealth , his estate aslope the shores of lake cephisus , and round him boeotians held the fertile plain .
and his loving wife went home , turning , glancing back again and again and weeping live warm tears .
just as he vaulted off his ship a dardan killed him , first by far of the argives slaughtered on the beaches .
but not even then were his men without a captain , yearn as they did for their lost leader .
no , podarces a fresh campaigner ranged their units — a son of iphiclus son of phylacus rich in flocks — podarces , gallant protesilaus ' blood brother , younger-born , but the older man proved braver too , an iron man of war .
third in the vanguard marched euryalus strong as a god , son of king mecisteus son of talaus , but over them all , with cries to marshal men diomedes led the whole force and his argives sailed in eighty long black ships .
and the men who lived in pherae fronting lake boebeis , in boebe and glaphyrae and iolcos ' sturdy ramparts : their eleven ships were led by admetus ' favored son , eumelus , born to admetus by alcestis , queen of women , the most radiant daughter pelias ever fathered .
four warlords led their ranks , ten-ship flotillas each , and filling the decks came bands of epean fighters , two companies under thalpius and amphimachus , sons of the line of actor , one of eurytus , one of cteatus .
but their captain lay on an island , racked with pain , on lemnos ' holy shores where the armies had marooned him , agonized by his wound , the bite of a deadly water-viper .
achilles lay there now but he would soon rise up in all his power .
no , medon formed them up , oileus ' bastard son whom rhene bore to oileus , grim raider of cities .
and men who settled tricca , rocky ithome terraced high and men who held oechalia , oechalian eurytus ' city : the two sons of asclepius led their units now , both skilled healers , podalirius and machaon .
in his son 's command sailed forty long black ships .
like flocks of sheep in a wealthy rancher 's steadings , thousands crowding to have their white milk drained , bleating nonstop when they hear their crying lambs — so the shouts rose up from the long trojan lines and not one cry , no common voice to bind them all together , their tongues mixed and clashed , their men hailed from so many far-flung countries .
facing ares ' power and hector helmed in bronze , they neither turned and ran for their black ships nor traded blows with enemies man-to-man .
and guneus out of cyphus led on two and twenty ships and in his platoons came enienes and battle-tried peraebians who pitched homes in the teeth of dodona 's bitter winters , who held the tilled acres along the lovely titaressus that runs her pure crystal currents into peneus — never mixed with peneus ' eddies glistening silt but gliding over the surface smooth as olive oil , branching , breaking away from the river styx , the dark and terrible oath-stream of the gods .
if only i 'd foreseen all this , i and my cunning — that day eurystheus sent him down to death , to the lord who guards the gates , to drag up from the dark world the hound of grisly death — he would never have fled the steep cascading styx .
and prothous son of tenthredon led the magnesians , men who lived around the peneus , up along mount pelion sloped in wind-whipped leaves .
and in his command sailed forty long black ships .
the men must know our claim : we are sworn friends from our fathers ' days till now !
— you , the son of tydeus , that skilled breaker of horses ?
hold back now .
phoebus apollo lord of the silver bow had bred them both in perea , a brace of mares that raced the war-god 's panic through the lines .
but best by far of the men was telamonian ajax while achilles raged apart .
but not even then did hector quit the battle .
and halting her horses near , the white-armed hera called out at once to the powerful son of cronus , pressing home her questions : father zeus , look — are n't you incensed at ares and all his brutal work ?
hephaestus gave it to cronus ' son , father zeus , and zeus gave it to hermes , the giant-killing guide and hermes gave it to pelops , that fine charioteer , pelops gave it to atreus , marshal of fighting men , who died and passed it on to thyestes rich in flocks and he in turn bestowed it on agamemnon , to bear on high as he ruled his many islands and lorded mainland argos .
so tribe on tribe , pouring out of the ships and shelters , marched across the scamander plain and the earth shook , tremendous thunder from under trampling men and horses drawing into position down the scamander meadow flats breaking into flower — men by the thousands , numberless as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring .
their masters ' chariots stood under blankets now , stored away in the tents while the rank and file , yearning for their leader , the great man of war , drifting here and there throughout the encampment , hung back from the fighting .
yet not for a moment did his army lack a leader , yearn as they did for the braver dead .
but on the armies came as if the whole earth were devoured by wildfire , yes , and the ground thundered under them , deep as it does for zeus who loves the lightning , zeus in all his rage when he lashes the ground around typhoeus in arima , there where they say the monster makes his bed of pain — so the earth thundered under their feet , armies trampling , sweeping through the plain at blazing speed .
iris the wind-quick messenger hurried down to ilium , bearing her painful message , sent by storming zeus .
he had kept a watch for the trojans , posted atop old aesyetes ' tomb and poised to sprint for home at the first sign of argives charging from the ships .
like him to the life , the racing iris urged , old priam , words , endless words — that is your passion , always , as once in the days of peace .
but ceaseless war 's upon us !
time and again i 've gone to battle , fought with men but i 've never seen an army great as this .
but whenever i 'd set my mind to drag you up , in deadly earnest , i 'd hoist you all with ease , you and the earth , you and the sea , all together , then loop that golden cable round a horn of olympus , bind it fast and leave the whole world dangling in mid-air — that is how far i tower over the gods , i tower over men .
let each chief give commands to the tribe he leads , move them out , marshal his own contingents — now !
but marshal agamemnon called out to the armies , hear me now , you trojans , dardans , trojan allies !
first , tall hector with helmet flashing led the trojans — priam 's son and in his command by far the greatest , bravest army , divisions harnessed in armor , veterans bristling spears .
and there in the midst , armed in gleaming bronze , in all his glory , he towered high over all his fighters — he was the greatest warlord , he led by far the largest army .
amphimachus and nastes led their formations on , nastes and amphimachus , nomion 's flamboyant sons .
not a word to achilles , not a question .
the father accepted the sacrifices , true , but doubled the weight of thankless , ruthless war .
and men who lived in zelea under the foot of ida , a wealthy clan that drank the aesepus ' dark waters — trojans all , and the shining son of lycaon led them on , pandarus , with the bow that came from apollo 's own hands .
even tremendous hades had to endure that flying shaft like all the rest , when the same man , the son of thunder-shielded zeus , shot him in pylos — there with the troops of battle dead — and surrendered death to pain .
must not give you orders .
that burly heart pylaemenes led his paphlagonians out of enetian country , land where the wild mules breed : the men who held cytorus and lived in range of sesamus , building their storied halls along the parthenius river , at cromna , aegialus and the highland fortress erythini .
euphemus led the cicones , fighters armed with spears , son of troezenus , ceas ' son , a warlord bred by the gods .
pyraechmes led the paeonians , reflex bows in hand , hailing from amydon far west and the broad river axius , axius , clearest stream that flows across the earth .
their father lived in the fortress town of phera , a man of wealth and worth , born of alpheus river running wide through pylian hills , the stream that sired ortilochus to rule their many men .
down he went , crushed by racing achilles ' hands , destroyed in the river where he slaughtered other trojans too .
obey us both .
mesthles and antiphus led maeonia 's proud contingent , talaemenes ' two sons sprung from the nymph of gyge lake led on maeonian units born and bred under mount tmolus .
nastes led the carians wild with barbarous tongues , men who held miletus , phthires ' ridges thick with timber , maeander 's currents and mount mycale 's craggy peaks .
nastes strolled to battle decked in gold like a girl , the fool !
pity me , please !
not that they would hide him out of friendship , even if someone saw him — all of them hated him like death , black death .
and last , sarpedon and valiant glaucus marched the lycians on from lycia far south , from the xanthus ' swirling rapids .
wildly as two winter torrents raging down from the mountains , swirling into a valley , hurl their great waters together , flash floods from the wellsprings plunging down in a gorge and miles away in the hills a shepherd hears the thunder — so from the grinding armies broke the cries and crash of war .
but achaea 's armies came on strong in silence , breathing combat-fury , hearts ablaze to defend each other to the death .
when the south wind showers mist on the mountaintops , no friend to shepherds , better than night to thieves — you can see no farther than you can fling a stone — so dust came clouding , swirling up from the feet of armies marching at top speed , trampling through the plain .
now closer , closing , front to front in the onset till paris sprang from the trojan forward ranks , a challenger , lithe , magnificent as a god , the skin of a leopard slung across his shoulders , a reflex bow at his back and battle-sword at hip and brandishing two sharp spears tipped in bronze he strode forth , challenging all the argive best to fight him face-to-face in mortal combat .
have all trojans and argives take their seats , and you , you challenge achaea 's bravest man to duel in bloody combat to the death .
soon as the warrior menelaus marked him , paris parading there with his big loping strides , flaunting before the troops , atrides thrilled like a lion lighting on some handsome carcass , lucky to find an antlered stag or wild goat just as hunger strikes — he rips it , bolts it down , even with running dogs and lusty hunters rushing him .
so menelaus thrilled at heart — princely paris there , right before his eyes .
there , you see ?
he thought , and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground .
the great fighter sank to his knees , bracing himself with one strong forearm planted against the earth , and the world went black as night before his eyes .
heroic sarpedon — his loyal comrades bore him out of the fighting quickly , weighed down by the heavy spearshaft dragging on .
now , long ablaze as he was to fight the trojans , triple the fury seized him — claw-mad as a lion some shepherd tending woolly flocks in the field has just grazed , a lion leaping into the fold , but he has n't killed him , only spurred his strength and helpless to beat him off the man scurries for shelter , leaving his flocks panicked , lost as the ramping beast mauls them thick-and-fast , piling corpse on corpse and in one furious bound clears the fenced yard — so raging diomedes mauled the trojans .
would to god you 'd never been born , died unwed .
else for a good long while i 'd have felt the pain , writhing among the corpses there , or soldiered on , weak as a breathless ghost , beaten down by bronze .
— is this the man who mustered the oarsmen once , who braved the seas in his racing deep-sea ships , trafficked with outlanders , carried off a woman far from her distant shores , a great beauty wed to a land of rugged spearmen ?
how could they ?
no use to you then , the fine lyre and these , these gifts of aphrodite , your long flowing locks and your striking looks , not when you roll and couple with the dust .
i might make you the butt of hard , withering hate from both sides at once , trojans and achaeans — then your fate can tread you down to dust !
what disgrace it will be — shame , cringing shame if not one danaan now steps up to battle hector .
the heart inside you is always tempered hard , like an ax that goes through wood when a shipwright cuts out ship timbers with every ounce of skill and the blade 's weight drives the man 's stroke .
still , do n't fling in my face the lovely gifts of golden aphrodite .
and now no man who waded into that work could scorn it any longer , anyone still not speared or stabbed by tearing bronze who whirled into the heart of all that slaughter — not even if great athena led him by the hand , flicking away the weapons hailing down against him .
and the one who proves the better man and wins , he 'll take those treasures fairly , lead the woman home .
and helen the radiance of women answered priam , i revere you so , dear father , dread you too — if only death had pleased me then , grim death , that day i followed your son to troy , forsaking my marriage bed , my kinsmen and my child , my favorite , now full-grown , and the lovely comradeship of women my own age .
just as he dragged that corpse the brave agenor spied his ribs , bared by his shield as he bent low — agenor stabbed with a bronze spear and loosed his limbs , his life spirit left him and over his dead body now the savage work went on , achaeans and trojans mauling each other there like wolves , leaping , hurtling into each other , man throttling man .
but the long-haired argive archers aimed at hector , trying to cut him down with arrows , hurling rocks till king agamemnon cried out in a ringing voice , hold back , argives !
look , hector with that flashing helmet of his — the man is trying to tell us something now .
quickly men fell silent and hector pleaded , appealing to both armed camps : hear me — trojans , achaeans geared for combat !
priam and noble trojans command me to report , if it proves acceptable , pleasing to one and all , the offer of paris who caused our long hard campaign .
think of it : paris and menelaus loved by ares go to fight it out with their rugged spears — all for you — and the man who wins that duel , you 'll be called his wife !
listen to me , quickly !
look what heavy casualties you have suffered just for me , my violent quarrel , and paris who brought it on you all .
bring two lambs — a white male and a black ewe for the sun and earth — and we 'll bring a third for zeus .
then priam the son of dardanus rose among them , a man who could match the gods for strong advice , and with good will toward all he swayed his people : hear me , trojans , dardans , all our loyal allies — i must speak out what the heart inside me urges .
parting them , holding their staffs between both men , the herald idaeus , cool , skilled in tactics , urged , no more , my sons — do n't kill yourselves in combat !
the achaean and trojan forces both exulted , hoping this would end the agonies of war .
they hauled their chariots up in ranks , at rest , the troops dismounted and stripped away their arms and laid them down on the earth , crowded together — hardly a foot of plowland showed between them .
back to the city hector sent two heralds now to bring the lambs at once and summon priam while king agamemnon sent talthybius off , heading down to the ships for one more lamb .
and now a messenger went to white-armed helen too , iris , looking for all the world like hector 's sister wed to antenor 's son , helicaon 's bride laodice , the loveliest daughter priam ever bred .
and iris came on helen in her rooms ... weaving a growing web , a dark red folding robe , working into the weft the endless bloody struggles stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze had suffered all for her at the god of battle 's hands .
they are calling for you now , commanders of both armies , stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze — come down to the plain so you can seal our oaths . now paris and menelaus , atrides loved by ares , will fight it out with their rugged spears for helen , and helen and all her treasures go to the man who wins .
then — with a shrill wail they all stretched their arms to athena as theano , her face radiant , lifting the robe on high , spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess ' knees and prayed to the daughter of mighty father zeus : queen athena — shield of our city — glory of goddesses !
polypoetes was not alone , leonteus shared the helm , companion of ares , caeneus ' grandson , proud coronus ' son .
so nestor said and atrides ranged forward , glad at heart , and came on peteos ' son the charioteer menestheus standing idle , and circling him athenian men who could raise the cry of battle .
as for the fighting , men will see to that , all who were born in troy but i most of all .
long years had brought their fighting days to a halt but they were eloquent speakers still , clear as cicadas settled on treetops , lifting their voices through the forest , rising softly , falling , dying away .
you have no mercy , none for dying trojans .
but that girl — you never block her way with a word or action , never , you spur her on , since you , you gave her birth from your own head , that child of devastation !
but where are they now ?
you are my child .
sit in front of me , so you can see your husband of long ago , your kinsmen and your people .
you are not to blame .
i wonder if you would fume at me if i hurled a stunning blow at the god of war and drove him from the fighting ?
look , who 's that achaean there , so stark and grand ?
many others afield are much taller , true , but i have never yet set eyes on one so regal , so majestic .
and i myself , hector , your ally-to-the-death , a good long way i came from distant lycia , far from the xanthus ' rapids where i left my loving wife , my baby son , great riches too , the lasting envy of every needy neighbor .
we can not find a thing .
why cringing here ?
but finally clear-eyed athena rose and spoke : our father , son of cronus , high and mighty , we already know your power , far too well .
i am a god too .
you , hector — you are my father now , my noble mother , a brother too , and you are my husband , young and warm and strong !
years ago i visited phrygia rife with vineyards , saw the phrygian men with their swarming horses there — multitudes — the armies of otreus , mygdon like a god , encamped that time along the sangarius river banks .
and i took my stand among them , comrade-in-arms the day the amazons struck , a match for men in war .
and sighting odysseus next the old king questioned helen , come , dear child , tell me of that one too — now who is he ?
shorter than atreus ' son agamemnon , clearly , but broader across the shoulders , through the chest .
his armor 's heaped on the green field but the man keeps ranging the ranks of fighters like a ram — yes , he looks to me like a thick-fleeced bellwether ram making his way through a big mass of sheep-flocks , shining silver-gray .
helen the child of zeus replied , that 's laertes ' son , the great tactician odysseus .
well , do as you please .
you know the truth — say it !
why , think what they say of mighty heracles — there was a man , my father , that dauntless , furious spirit , that lionheart .
i know for a fact the spirit in your heart is well-disposed to me and all my efforts .
now , when they mingled with our trojans in assembly , standing side-by-side , menelaus ' shoulders mounted over his friend 's in height and spread , when both were seated odysseus looked more lordly .
whatever i choose to plan apart from all the gods — no more of your everlasting questions , probe and pry no more .
but when he let loose that great voice from his chest and the words came piling on like a driving winter blizzard — then no man alive could rival odysseus !
we no longer gazed in wonder at his looks .
catching sight of a third fighter , ajax , the old king asked her next , who 's that other achaean , so powerful , so well-built ?
he towers over the argives , his head , his massive shoulders !
and idomeneus over there — standing with his cretans — like a god , you see ?
our people will live in peace on the rich soil of troy , our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of argos , the land of achaea where the women are a wonder ... when hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man 's land along his lines he strode , gripping his spear mid-haft , staving men to a standstill .
but why now ?
now through troy the heralds brought the offerings for the gods , sacred victims to bind and seal the oaths : two lambs and the wine that warms the heart , the yield of the vine , filling a goatskin sack , and the herald idaeus carried a gleaming bowl and golden winecups .
so off he went to lycia , safe in the escort of the gods , and once he reached the broad highlands cut by the rushing xanthus , the king of lycia gave him a royal welcome .
and on their side the trojans put on harness too , mustering throughout the city , a smaller force but nerved to engage in combat even so — necessity pressed them to fight for sons and wives .
and the one who proves the better man and wins , he 'll take those treasures fairly , lead the woman home .
i tell you this , so help me it 's the truth : if zeus with his storm-shield and queen athena ever let me plunder the strong walls of troy , you are the first , the first after myself — i 'll place some gift of honor in your hands , a tripod , or purebred team with their own car or a fine woman to mount and share your bed .
they promptly obeyed and priam climbed aboard , pulling the reins back taut .
reaching the front , they climbed down from the chariot , onto the earth that feeds us all , and into the space between achaean and trojan lines they marched .
now close beside him the bright-eyed goddess stood and urged him on : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician — what , is this the way ?
the noble heralds brought on the victims marked for the gods to seal and bind the oaths .
they mixed the contenders ' wine in a large bowl and rinsed the warlords ' waiting hands with water .
atreus ' son drew forth the dagger always slung at his battle-sword 's big sheath , cut some tufts from the lambs ' heads , and heralds passed them round to achaean and trojan captains .
and marshal agamemnon took his lead : pray god you 're right , dear brother menelaus !
and his loving father laughed , his mother laughed as well , and glorious hector , quickly lifting the helmet from his head , set it down on the ground , fiery in the sunlight , and raising his son he kissed him , tossed him in his arms , lifting a prayer to zeus and the other deathless gods : zeus , all you immortals !
then promise to sacrifice twelve heifers in her shrine , yearlings never broken , if only she 'll pity troy , the trojan wives and all our helpless children , if only she 'll hold diomedes back from the holy city — that wild spearman , that invincible headlong terror !
but if priam and priam 's sons refuse to pay , refuse me , agamemnon — with paris beaten down — then i myself will fight it out for the ransom , i 'll battle here to the end of our long war .
on those terms he dragged his ruthless dagger across the lambs ' throats and let them fall to the ground , dying , gasping away their life breath , cut short by the sharp bronze .
then dipping up the wine from the mixing bowls , brimming their cups , pouring them on the earth , men said their prayers to the gods who never die .
whichever contenders trample on this treaty first , spill their brains on the ground as this wine spills — theirs , their children 's too — their enemies rape their wives !
but zeus would not fulfill their prayers , not yet .
but no , it was not the gallant odysseus ' fate to finish zeus 's rugged son with his sharp bronze , so pallas swung his fury against the lycian front .
then and there he unstrapped his polished bow , the horn of a wild goat he 'd shot in the chest one day as the springy ibex clambered down a cliff .
but priam 's son prince hector and royal odysseus measured off the ground for single combat first , then dropped two stones in a helmet , lots for casting — who would be first to hurl his bronze-tipped spear ?
— lord apollo the son of zeus replied — we 'll spur his nerve and strength , that breaker of horses , see if he 'll challenge one of the argives man-to-man and they will duel in bloody combat to the death .
hector with that flashing helmet would meet his match in combat in a moment .
the troops sat down by rank , each beside his horses pawing the ground where blazoned war-gear lay .
and now — one warrior harnessed burnished armor on his back , magnificent paris , fair-haired helen 's consort .
first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves , fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps , next he strapped a breastplate round his chest , his brother lycaon 's that fitted him so well .
come , try it !
with that he gave him his silver-studded sword , slung in its sheath on a supple , well-cut sword-strap , and ajax gave his war-belt , glistening purple .
in the same breath , shining hector reached down for his son — but the boy recoiled , cringing against his nurse 's full breast , screaming out at the sight of his own father , terrified by the flashing bronze , the horsehair crest , the great ridge of the helmet nodding , bristling terror — so it struck his eyes .
bring that man into range and let me spear him !
both men armed at opposing sides of the forces , into the no man 's land between the lines they strode , glances menacing , wild excitement seizing all who watched , the stallion-breaking trojans and argive men-at-arms .
striking a stand in the dueling-ground just cleared they brandished spears at each other , tense with fury .
suddenly paris hurled — his spear 's long shadow flew and the shaft hit menelaus ' round shield , full center — not pounding through , the brazen point bent back in the tough armor .
but his turn next — menelaus reared with a bronze lance and a prayer to father zeus : zeus , king , give me revenge , he wronged me first !
but since the gods ordained it all , these desperate years , i wish i had been the wife of a better man , someone alive to outrage , the withering scorn of men .
but pirous — aetolian thoas speared him as he swerved and sprang away , the lancehead piercing his chest above the nipple plunged deep in his lung , and thoas , running up , wrenched the heavy spear from the man 's chest , drew his blade , ripped him across the belly , took his life but he could not strip his armor .
shaking his spear , he hurled and its long shadow flew and the shaft hit paris ' round shield , hit full center — straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked , tearing the war-shirt , close by paris ' flank it jabbed but the trojan swerved aside and dodged black death .
but lord god apollo , gazing down now from the heights of pergamus , rose in outrage , crying down at the trojans , up and at them , you stallion-breaking trojans !
father zeus , when did you ever strike a mighty king with such mad blindness — then tear away his glory ?
here i thought i 'd punish paris for all his outrage — now my sword is shattered , right in my hands , look , my spear flew from my grip for nothing — i never hit him !
i look , i ca n't find one .
lunging at paris , he grabbed his horsehair crest , swung him round , started to drag him into argive lines and now the braided chin-strap holding his helmet tight was gouging his soft throat — paris was choking , strangling .
but great ajax next — dear to the gods he hurled and his spear 's shadow flew and the shaft hit hector 's round shield , hit full center — straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove , ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked , tearing the war-shirt , close by hector 's flank it jabbed but the trojan swerved aside and dodged black death .
so now if a god comes up to test your mettle , you must not fight the immortal powers head-on , all but one of the deathless gods , that is — if aphrodite daughter of zeus slips into battle , she 's the one to stab with your sharp bronze spear !
now he 'd have hauled him off and won undying glory but aphrodite , zeus 's daughter quick to the mark , snapped the rawhide strap , cut from a bludgeoned ox , and the helmet came off empty in menelaus ' fist .
helmet flashing , rangy hector hurled a resounding yell : diomedes — once the danaan riders prized you first of men with pride of place , choice meats and brimming cups .
one he stabbed with a bronze lance above the nipple , the other his heavy sword hacked at the collarbone , right on the shoulder , cleaving the whole shoulder clear of neck and back .
whirling it round the fighter sent it flying into his argives scrambling fast to retrieve it — back at his man he sprang , enraged with brazen spear , mad for the kill but aphrodite snatched paris away , easy work for a god , wrapped him in swirls of mist and set him down in his bedroom filled with scent .
then off she went herself to summon helen and found her there on the steep , jutting tower with a troop of trojan women clustered round her .
the goddess reached and tugged at her fragrant robe , whispering low , for all the world like an old crone , the old weaver who , when they lived in lacedaemon , wove her fine woolens and helen held her dear .
you 'd never dream he 's come from fighting a man , you 'd think he 's off to a dance or slipped away from the dancing , stretching out at ease .
she knew the goddess at once , the long lithe neck , the smooth full breasts and the fire in those eyes — and she was amazed , she burst out with her name : maddening one , my goddess , oh what now ?
but you , hector , you go back to the city , tell our mother to gather all the older noble women together in gray-eyed athena 's shrine on the city 's crest , unlock the doors of the goddess ' sacred chamber — and take a robe , the largest , loveliest robe that she can find throughout the royal halls , a gift that far and away she prizes most herself , and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess ' knees .
so he gloried but queen hera stirred in outrage , she shook on her throne and mount olympus quaked as she cried in the face of the rugged god poseidon , you ruthless — the earth-shaker with all your power — not even a twinge of pity deep inside your heart for all these argives dying !
it would be wrong , disgraceful to share that coward 's bed once more .
but hector told them only , pray to the gods — all the trojan women , one after another .
oh how wrong it is , this anger you keep smoldering in your heart !
so she threatened and helen the daughter of mighty zeus was terrified .
but i will suffer terrible grief for you , menelaus , if you die now , if you fill out your destiny now — and i go back to parching argos in disgrace .
shrouding herself in her glinting silver robes she went along , in silence .
there aphrodite quickly brought her a chair , the goddess herself with her everlasting smile , and set it down , face-to-face with paris .
her husband noticed , and filled with pity now , hector stroked her gently , trying to reassure her , repeating her name : andromache , dear one , why so desperate ?
we 'll fight again tomorrow .
oh would to god you 'd died there , brought down by that great soldier , my husband long ago .
wait , take my advice and call a halt right here : no more battling with fiery-haired menelaus , pitting strength against strength in single combat — madness .
not i , i 'll never go back again .
do n't alarm the men , not for a moment .
he just might impale you on his spear !
but you , you just stand there — do n't even command the rest to brace and defend their wives .
i 'll bring him down tomorrow .
even we have gods who battle on our side .
not once , i swear , did i pass some handsome shrine of yours , sailing my oar-swept ship on our fatal voyage here , but on each i burned the fat and thighs of oxen , longing to raze troy 's sturdy walls to the roots .
he led the way to bed .
his wife went with him .
there , massed in formation as they were , not a single man could claim he outstripped diomedes , tydeus ' son lashing his high-strung team across the trench to reach the front and battle hand-to-hand — the first by far to kill a trojan captain , agelaus the son of phradmon .
i never met the man myself , never saw him , but they say he had no equal .
even so , we pity these argive spearmen living out their grim fates , dying in blood .
now , though , if you really want me to fight to the finish here , have all trojans and argives take their seats and pit me against menelaus dear to ares — right between the lines — we 'll fight it out for helen and all her wealth .
now aloft by the side of zeus the gods sat in council , conferring across olympus ' golden floor as noble hebe poured them rounds of nectar .
they lifted golden beakers , pledging each other warmly , gazing down on troy .
but hera and great athena were looking on and with mocking words began to provoke the father , athena leading off with taunts , her eyes bright : father zeus , i wonder if you would fume at me if i ventured a bold guess ?
and aphrodite who loves eternal laughter sobbed in answer , the son of tydeus stabbed me , diomedes , that overweening , insolent — all because i was bearing off my son from the fighting .
it 's no longer ghastly war for troy and achaea — now , i tell you , the argives fight the gods !
but then , once he received that fatal message sent from his own daughter 's husband , first he ordered bellerophon to kill the chimaera — grim monster sprung of the gods , nothing human , all lion in front , all snake behind , all goat between , terrible , blasting lethal fire at every breath !
so he mocked as athena and queen hera muttered between themselves , huddled together , plotting troy 's destruction .
but hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer , suddenly bursting out , dread majesty , son of cronus , what are you saying ?
but with hera , though , i am not so outraged , so irate — it 's always her way to thwart my will , whatever i command .
how can you think of making all my labor worthless , all gone for nothing ?
mortal labor — the sweat i poured , my horses panting , spent from launching achaea 's armies , heaping pains on priam and priam 's sons .
nothing — unless we do exactly as i say .
but zeus hates me now .
daughter of storming zeus , tireless one , athena — how hollow our vow to menelaus that he would sack the mighty walls of troy before he sailed for home — if we let murderous ares rampage on this way .
do n't lag behind , do n't fling yourself at spoils just to haul the biggest portion back to your ship .
whenever i am bent on tearing down some city filled with men you love — to please myself — never attempt to thwart my fury , hera , give me my way .
i will see to this .
charioteers swung chariots round , thrust the powerful fist of fury straight ahead and murderous ares keen to help the trojans shrouded the carnage over in dense dark night — lunging at all points , carrying out the commands of phoebus apollo , lord of the golden sword , who ordered ares to whip the trojans ' war-lust once he spotted athena veering off the lines , great pallas who 'd rushed to back the argives .
the three cities that i love best of all are argos and sparta , mycenae with streets as broad as troy 's .
raze them — whenever they stir the hatred in your heart .
we 'll simply offer the argives tactics that may save them — so they wo n't all fall beneath your blazing wrath .
you are far stronger than i. still , you must not make my labor come to nothing .
my descent the same as yours — crooked-minded cronus fathered me as well , the first of all his daughters , first both ways : both by birth and since i am called your consort and you in turn rule all the immortal gods .
you will find them a trial , though you are my wife .
so come , let us yield to each other now on this one point , i to you and you to me , and the other deathless powers will fall in line .
but quickly , order athena down to battle now , into the killing-ground of trojans and achaeans — and see that the trojans break the sworn truce first and trample on the argives in their triumph !
down you go to troy 's and achaea 's armies now — and see that the trojans break the sworn truce first and trample on the argives in their triumph .
the father of men and gods complied at once .
and the argives gave way , they quit the slaughter — they thought some god swept down from the starry skies to back the trojans now , they wheeled and rallied so .
the brilliant runner achilles lay among his ships , raging over briseis , the girl with lustrous hair , the prize he seized from lyrnessus — after he had fought to exhaustion at lyrnessus , storming the heights , and breached the walls of thebes and toppled the vaunting spearmen epistrophus and mynes , sons of king euenus , selepius ' son .
like a shooting star athena flashed across the earth , plunging down in the midst of both camped forces .
even for generations still to come , to learn that achaean armies so strong , so vast , fought a futile war .
come , let us give each other gifts , unforgettable gifts , so any man may say , trojan soldier or argive , 'first they fought with heart-devouring hatred , then they parted , bound by pacts of friendship .
as achaeans and trojans wondered what was coming , athena merged in the trojan columns like a fighter , like antenor 's son the rugged spearman laodocus , hunting for pandarus , hoping to find the archer .
find him she did , lycaon 's skilled , fearless son , standing by , flanked by the bands of shielded men who 'd trooped with him from aesepus ' dark rapids .
find him he did , lycaon 's skilled , fearless son , and went right up and challenged him to his face : pandarus , where 's your bow , your winged arrows , your archer 's glory ?
but the butcher did see tydeus ' rugged son and he dropped gigantic periphas on the spot where he 'd just killed him , ripped his life away and ares whirled at the stallion-breaking diomedes — the two of them closing fast , charging face-to-face and the god thrust first , over tydides ' yoke and reins , with bronze spear burning to take the fighter 's life .
come , up with you , whip an arrow at this invincible menelaus — now !
but swear to apollo , wolf-god , glorious archer , you 'll slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs when you march home to zelea 's sacred city .
backing , helmet flashing , his strong hand hefting a rock from the field , dark , jagged , a ton weight — he hurled it at ajax , struck the gigantic shield , seven oxhides thick , struck right on the jutting boss and the bronze clanged , echoing round and round as ajax hoisting a boulder — far larger — wheeled and heaved it , putting his weight behind it , tremendous force — and the rock crashed home , hector 's shield burst in , hit by a millstone — and hector 's fine knees buckled , flat on his back he went , his shield crushing down on him swept him off his feet .
propping an end against the ground as cohorts braced their shields in a tight wedge to hide him , fearing bands of argives might just leap to their feet before he could hit menelaus , atreus ' fighting son .
he flipped the lid of his quiver , plucked an arrow fletched and never shot , a shaft of black pain .
quickly notching the sharp arrow on the string he swore to apollo , wolf-god , glorious archer , he 'd slaughter splendid victims , newborn lambs when he marched home to zelea 's sacred city .
squeezing the nock and string together , drawing the gut back to his nipple , iron head to the handgrip till he flexed the great weapon back in a half-circle curve — the bow sprang !
and shattered with anger , the old man withdrew but apollo heard his prayer — he loved him , deeply — he loosed his shaft at the argives , withering plague , and now the troops began to drop and die in droves , the arrows of god went showering left and right , whipping through the achaeans ' vast encampment .
but not even those hordes could match these hordes of yours , your fiery-eyed achaeans !
she reared before you , skewed the tearing shaft , flicking it off your skin as quick as a mother flicks a fly from her baby sleeping softly .
athena 's own hand deflected it down the belt where the gold buckles clasp and breastplates overlap .
the shaft pierced the tight belt 's twisted thongs , piercing the blazoned plates , piercing the guard he wore to shield his loins and block the spears , his best defense — the shaft pierced even this , the tip of the weapon grazing the man 's flesh , and dark blood came spurting from the wound .
then athena , child of zeus whose shield is thunder , letting fall her supple robe at the father 's threshold — rich brocade , stitched with her own hands ' labor — donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning , buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war and over her shoulders slung her shield , all tassels flaring terror — panic mounted high in a crown around it .
the lord of men agamemnon shuddered , frightened to see the dark blood gushing from the wound .
i had already whipped an arrow into him , caught him square in the right shoulder too , just where the breastplate leaves the armpit bare , and i thought i 'd sent him down to the house of death but i 've still not laid him low .
nevertheless , king agamemnon , groaning heavily , grasped menelaus ' hand and spoke out for the men as friends around him groaned as well : dear brother — that truce i sealed in blood was death for you , setting you out alone .
just you watch , if you 'll take the time and care to taste some action , watch telemachus ' loving father lock and fight with enemy champions , stallion-breaking trojans .
and you beneath the ground who punish the dead — whoever broke his oath — be witness here , protect our binding pacts .
but they will never go for nothing , the oaths , the blood of the lambs , the unmixed wine we poured , the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted .
but with hera , though , he is not so outraged , so irate — it 's always your way to thwart his will , whatever zeus commands .
and now holding that great shield before his chest telamonian ajax marched right up to hector , threatening with his deep resounding voice , hector , now you 'll learn , once and for all , in combat man-to-man , what kind of champions range the argive ranks , even besides achilles , that lionheart who mauls battalions wholesale .
all this will come to pass .
— blazing achilles broke in quickly — what a worthless , burnt-out coward i 'd be called if i would submit to you and all your orders , whatever you blurt out .
one more thing — take it to heart , i tell you — if part of athena 's plan gives me the honor to kill them both , you check our racers here , you lash them fast to our rails then dash for aeneas ' horses — do n't forget — drive them out of the trojan lines and into ours .
then some trojan will glory , swaggering , arrogant , leaping down on the grave of famous menelaus : 'let agamemnon wreak his anger so on all his foes !
just as he led his armies here for nothing , failure .
now home he 's gone to the dear land of his fathers , his warships empty , leaving behind the hero menelaus moldering in his wake !
what are you saying ?
so he 'll boast , i know — let the great earth gape and take me down that day !
for the good of all he urged them : agamemnon !
no , do n't give up now .
it 's not my nature to shrink from battle , cringe in fear with the fighting strength still steady in my chest .
it is my pleasure too .
but the wound — a healer will treat it , apply drugs and put a stop to the black waves of pain .
agamemnon turned to the sacred herald : quick , talthybius .
the archer loosed a fresh shaft from the bowstring straight for hector , his spirit longing to hit him — but he missed and cut gorgythion down instead , a well-bred son of priam , a handsome prince , and the arrow pierced his chest , gorgythion whom priam 's bride from aesyme bore one day , lovely castianira lithe as a deathless goddess .
forward he ranged the charioteers with teams and cars , backed by infantry close behind them , milling , brave men , the defensive line of battle — that would be their role .
up now , rouse our fighting-fury !
an archer 's hit him , a good hand at the bow , some trojan or some lycian — all glory to him , a heavy blow to us .
and gaining the place where red-haired menelaus nursed his wound and a growing ring of warlords pressed around him , striding into their midst the godsent healer reached the captain 's side and quickly drew the shaft from his buckled belt — he pulled it clear , the sharp barbs broke back .
he loosed the glittering belt and slipped it off and the loin-piece and the plated guard below it , gear the bronzesmiths made .
when he saw the wound where the tearing arrow hit , he sucked out the blood and deftly applied the healing salves that chiron , friend of asclepius , gave his father long ago .
enemy weapons beating against him , worse , he dreaded the trojans too , swarming round him , a tough ring of them , brave and bristling spears , massing , rearing over their comrade 's body now and rugged , strong and proud as the great ajax was , they shoved him back — he gave ground , staggering , reeling .
you would not find him asleep , not cringing a moment , hanging back from the struggle — he pressed for battle now where men win glory .
he left his team and burnished bronze car with an aide , eurymedon , ptolemaeus piraides ' son reining off to the side his snorting pair of stallions .
antilochus sprang , he plunged a sword in his temple and mydon , gasping , hurled from his bolted car facefirst , head and shoulders stuck in a dune a good long time for the sand was soft and deep — his lucky day — till his own horses trampled him down , down flat as antilochus lashed them hard and drove them back to achaea 's waiting ranks .
then out he went on foot to range the ranks .
so he recoiled , shouting out to comrades , oh my friends , what fools we were to marvel at wondrous hector , what a spearman , we said , and what a daring fighter !
do n't tell me you rank our fathers with ourselves !
father zeus , i swear , will never defend the trojans , liars — they were the first to trample on their oaths .
so vultures will eat them raw , their firm young flesh , and we , we 'll drag their dear wives and helpless children back to the beaked ships , once we 've seized their city !
but any men he saw retreating from hateful battle he would lash with a sharp burst of rage : you argives — glorious braggarts !
down the plain he stormed like a stream in spate , a routing winter torrent sweeping away the dikes : the tight , piled dikes ca n't hold it back any longer , banks shoring the blooming vineyards can not curb its course — a flash flood bursts as the rains from zeus pour down their power , acre on acre the well-dug work of farmers crumbling under it — so under tydides ' force the trojan columns panicked now , no standing their ground , massed , packed as they were .
hector far in the lead , bristling in all his force like a hound that harries a wild boar or lion — hot pursuit , snapping quick at his heels , hindquarters and flanks but still on alert for him to wheel and fight — so hector harried the long-haired argives , killing the last stragglers , man after lagging man and they , they fled in panic .
spotting them now the lord of men agamemnon dressed them down with a winging burst of scorn : you there , peteos ' son , a king , dear to the gods !
king agamemnon , thrilled to watch them work , was quick to salute the chief and sing his praises : you are the one i prize , idomeneus , more than all our argive fighters fast with chariot-teams — whether in war or action of any sort or feasts where the ranking argive warlords mix their bowls with the shining wine of kings .
that time you vaunted you were the finest force on earth — all that empty bluster you let fly at lemnos , gorging yourselves on longhorn cattle meat and drunk to the full on brimming bowls of wine , bragging how each man could stand up to a hundred , no , two hundred trojan fighters in pitched battle .
the noble son of hippolochus answered staunchly , high-hearted son of tydeus , why ask about my birth ?
and a man may say , who sees you streaming tears , 'there is the wife of hector , the bravest fighter they could field , those stallion-breaking trojans , long ago when the men fought for troy .
with those words he left her in chryses ' arms and the priest embraced the child he loved , exultant .
elated and making way through crowds of troops he found the two called ajax , great and little , both captains armed for attack with a cloud of infantry forming up behind them .
bearing down beneath the rush of the west wind and miles away he sees it building black as pitch , blacker , whipping the whitecaps , full hurricane fury — the herdsman shudders to see it , drives his flocks to a cave — so dense the battalions grouped behind the two aeantes , packed , massed with hardy fighters dear to the gods , battalions black and bristling shields and spears , fighters sweeping into the breaking storm of war .
i for one have no desire to battle zeus , not you and i and the rest of the gods together .
so why not go back now , hurl your challenge at menelaus dear to ares , fight it out together , man-to-man again ?
oh if only — father zeus , athena , apollo — i were young again !
ah if only it might prove well and good to all , to every immortal god , men might still live on in royal priam 's citadel .
he spun on his heels and left them there in place , heading for other ranks and came on nestor next , the clear speaker of pylos posting troops , readying them for action , combat units forming under the lanky pelagon , alastor and chromius , haemon and stocky bias , skilled captain of armies .
they rushed to arms and all the gates flung wide and the trojan mass surged out , horses , chariots , men on foot — a tremendous roar went up .
and first he gave his drivers strict commands to rein their teams back hard and never panic , no fouling them in the onslaught : let no man , so sure of his horsemanship and soldier 's prowess , dare to fight it out alone with the trojans , exposed in front of his lines .
now i say this to our stallion-breaking trojans , i say no , straight out — i wo n't give up the woman !
he 'd just turned his chariot round in flight and once he 'd swerved diomedes ' spear went punching through his back , gouging his shoulder blade and driving through his chest — he spilled from the chariot , armor clanging against him .
the old soldier spurring his men with skills from a lifetime spent campaigning , battles long ago .
the minds of the younger men are always flighty , but let an old man stand his ground among them , one who can see the days behind , the days ahead — that is the best hope for peace , for both our armies .
if only some other fighter had your years and you could march with the younger , fitter men !
do n't seize the girl , agamemnon , powerful as you are — leave her , just as the sons of achaea gave her , his prize from the very first .
nevertheless , i 'll still troop with the horsemen , give them maneuvers , discipline and commands : that is the right and pride of us old men .
and how you used to boast , year in , year out , that you were the better man than fighting menelaus in power , arm and spear !
and zeus 's son sarpedon rejoiced to see him striding past and begged him in his pain , son of priam , do n't leave me lying here , such easy prey for the danaans — protect me !
but when odysseus sprang up , the famed tactician would just stand there , staring down , hard , his eyes fixed on the ground , never shifting his scepter back and forth , clutching it stiff and still like a mindless man .
the call to action had still not reached their ears and the columns were only just now forming , moving out , stallion-breaking trojans and long lines of achaeans .
antiphus hurled at him — the son of priam wearing a gleaming breastplate let fly through the lines but his sharp spear missed and he hit leucus instead , odysseus ' loyal comrade , gouging his groin as the man hauled off a corpse — it dropped from his hands and leucus sprawled across it .
seeing his anger flare , field marshal agamemnon smiled broadly and took back his taunts at once : royal son of laertes , odysseus , great tactician , i must not bait you so beyond the limit .
waiting for others to do your fighting for you ?
you — it 's your duty to stand in the front ranks and take your share of the scorching blaze of battle .
raising his spear , the lord of the war cry drove it home , planting it deep down in the earth that feeds us all and with winning words he called out to glaucus , the young captain , splendid — you are my friend , my guest from the days of our grandfathers long ago !
how could he know what work the father had in mind ?
how can you say i hang back from the fighting when argive units spur the slashing god of war against these trojan horsemen ?
what do you care ?
you 'll bring a ray of hope to your men , your father too .
you and your bluster — you are talking nonsense !
agamemnon 's cry went piercing through the army : shame !
but if he 's the man i think he is , tydeus ' gallant son , he rages so with a god beside him — not alone , no — a god with his shoulders shrouded round in cloud who deflects my shaft to a less mortal spot .
why , it 's as if they had caught you in public , doing something wrong ...
may the gods make all our bluster come to nothing .
the two aeantes , tydides and odysseus spurred them on to attack .
and he came on tydeus ' son , impetuous diomedes standing by in his bolted car behind his team with sthenelus flanked beside him , capaneus ' son .
hearing that , the son of atreus strode on .
or deny me outright .
nor did the man live long , not with the hate of all the gods against him .
or so they claim who watched him at his work .
i 've never seen such men , i never will again .
true enough , he came to mycenae once but not at war with us — a guest , a friend , with the royal polynices raising troops that time they geared to attack the holy walls of thebes .
my kin were glad to oblige and grant them their requests — till zeus changed our minds with a flash of bad omens .
so off they went , getting some distance on their way and reached the asopus ' grassy banks and reedbeds .
he marched out at once and came on crowds , menacing bands of thebans feasting away in the halls of mighty eteocles .
and now despite their courage the trojan fighters seeing the two sons of dares , one on the run , one dead beside his chariot — all their hearts were stunned .
and not only short , now , but filled with heartbreak too , more than all other men alive — doomed twice over .
but tydeus treated them all to a shameful fate , finished them all but let one run for home , heeding the gods ' signs he let the hunter off .
but every mortal calls the sea-god 's son , aegaeon , though he 's stronger than his father .
not a thought for the many times i saved his son heracles , worked to death by the labors of eurystheus .
but capaneus ' headstrong son lashed back in style : do n't lie , atrides !
we are the ones who stormed the seven gates of thebes , heading a weaker force and facing stronger walls but obeying the gods ' signs and backed by zeus .
so come , follow my orders .
i do n't blame agamemnon , our commander in chief , for goading his combat-ready argives into battle .
but if i kill him and apollo grants me glory , i 'll strip his gear and haul it back to sacred troy and hang it high on the deadly archer 's temple walls .
he pleaded with both kings , with clear good will , no more — or enormous sorrow comes to all achaea !
so now we plan how the war will all work out : do we rouse the pain and grisly fighting once again or hand down pacts of peace between both armies ?
with that challenge he sprang from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground .
both down but menelaus pitied them both , yes , and out for blood he burst through the front , helmed in fiery bronze , shaking his spear , and ares ' fury drove him , ares hoping to see him crushed at aeneas ' hands .
as a heavy surf assaults some roaring coast , piling breaker on breaker whipped by the west wind , and out on the open sea a crest first rears its head then pounds down on the shore with hoarse , rumbling thunder and in come more shouldering crests , arching up and breaking against some rocky spit , exploding salt foam to the skies — so wave on wave they came , achaean battalions ceaseless , surging on to war .
a hushed silence held the ranks .
you 'd never think so many troops could march holding their voices in their chests , all silence , fearing their chiefs who called out clear commands , and the burnished blazoned armor round their bodies flared , the formations trampling on .
fresh as two young lions off on the mountain ridges , twins reared by a lioness deep in the dark glades , that ravage shepherds ' steadings , mauling the cattle and fat sheep till it 's their turn to die — hacked down by the cleaving bronze blades in the shepherds ' hands .
no one alive has ever escaped it , neither brave man nor coward , i tell you — it 's born with us the day that we are born .
ares drove them , fiery-eyed athena drove the argives , and terror and rout and relentless strife stormed too , sister of manslaughtering ares , ares ' comrade-in-arms — strife , only a slight thing when she first rears her head but her head soon hits the sky as she strides across the earth .
now strife hurled down the leveler hate amidst both sides , wading into the onslaught , flooding men with pain .
and with that he swung their racers round , mid-flight , back again to the rout — trojans and hector after them , shouting their savage cries and pelting both men now with spears and painful arrows .
there diomedes aimed and stabbed , he gouged him down his glistening flesh and wrenched the spear back out and the brazen god of war let loose a shriek , roaring , thundering loud as nine , ten thousand combat soldiers shriek with ares ' fury when massive armies clash .
and once they reached the plains of troy where the two rivers flow , where simois and scamander rush together , the white-armed goddess hera reined her team , loosing them from the chariot-yoke and round them poured a dense shrouding mist and before their hoofs the simois sprang ambrosial grass for them to graze .
antilochus was the first to kill a trojan captain , tough on the front lines , thalysias ' son echepolus .
antilochus thrust first , speared the horsehair helmet right at the ridge , and the bronze spearpoint lodged in the man 's forehead , smashing through his skull and the dark came whirling down across his eyes — he toppled down like a tower in the rough assault .
pirous who heaved the rock came rushing in and speared him up the navel — his bowels uncoiled , spilling loose on the ground and the dark came swirling down across his eyes .
as he fell the enormous elephenor grabbed his feet , chalcodon 's son , lord of the brave-hearted abantes , dragged him out from under the spears , rushing madly to strip his gear but his rush was short-lived .
now his shield took powerful agamemnon 's spear but failed to deflect it , straight through it smashed , bronze splitting his belt and plunging down his guts — he fell , thundering , armor ringing against him .
the father , still bent on plaguing the argives and trojans both with wounds and groans in the bloody press of battle .
and telamonian ajax struck anthemion 's son , the hardy stripling simoisius , still unwed .
but never would he repay his loving parents now for the gift of rearing — his life cut short so soon , brought down by the spear of lionhearted ajax .
rearing , bolting in terror down the plain his horses snared themselves in tamarisk branches , splintered his curved chariot just at the pole 's tip and breaking free they made a dash for the city walls where battle-teams by the drove stampeded back in panic .
so lay anthemion 's son simoisius , cut down by the giant royal ajax .
nestor grasped the glistening reins in both fists , lashed the team and they charged straight at hector charging straight at them as tydides hurled a spear and missed his man but he picked the driver off , eniopeus son of proud thebaeus gripping the reins — he slashed him beside the nipple , stabbed his chest and off the car he pitched , his horses balking , rearing .
but if they give me nothing i will take a prize myself — your own , or ajax ' or odysseus ' prize — i 'll commandeer her myself and let that man i go to visit choke with rage !
whirling , killing coeranus , chromius and alastor , killing alcander and halius , prytanis and noemon — and stalwart odysseus would have killed still more but tall hector , his helmet flashing , marked him quickly , plowed through the front , helmed in fiery bronze , filling the argives ' hearts with sudden terror .
with that he hurled and athena drove the shaft and it split the archer 's nose between the eyes — it cracked his glistening teeth , the tough bronze cut off his tongue at the roots , smashed his jaw and the point came ripping out beneath his chin .
shaped like the runner acamas , prince of thrace , ares challenged the sons of priam with a vengeance : you royal sons of priam , monarch dear to the gods , how long will you let achaeans massacre your army ?
and hector called to his men in a ringing voice , trojans !
fling them at others , do n't give me commands !
but soon as i reach their hollow ships , torches — do n't forget now , one of you bring me lethal fire !
achilles the son of lovely sleek-haired thetis — the man 's not even fighting , no , he wallows in all his heartsick fury by the ships !
but zeus 's daughter athena spurred the argives on — athena first in glory , third-born of the gods — whenever she saw some slacker hanging back as she hurtled through the onset .
now amarinceus ' son diores — fate shackled diores fast and a jagged rock struck him against his right shin , beside the ankle .
he seized my foot , he hurled me off the tremendous threshold and all day long i dropped , i was dead weight and then , when the sun went down , down i plunged on lemnos , little breath left in me .
meriones caught him quickly , running him down hard and speared him low in the right buttock — the point pounding under the pelvis , jabbed and pierced the bladder — he dropped to his knees , screaming , death swirling round him .
closing , meges gave him some close attention too — the famous spearman struck behind his skull , just at the neck-cord , the razor spear slicing straight up through the jaws , cutting away the tongue — he sank in the dust , teeth clenching the cold bronze .
not i , no .
but off in his beaked seagoing ships he lay , raging away at atrides agamemnon , king of armies , while his men sported along the surf , marking time , hurling the discus , throwing spears and testing bows .
and so the two lay stretched in the dust , side-by-side , a lord of thrace , a lord of epeans armed in bronze and a ruck of other soldiers died around them .
but apollo quickly pulled him up — and now they 'd have closed with swords , hacked each other if heralds of zeus and men had not come rushing in , one from the trojans , one from the armed achaeans , talthybius and idaeus , both with good clear heads .
that day ranks of trojans , ranks of achaean fighters sprawled there side-by-side , facedown in the dust .
then pallas athena granted tydeus ' son diomedes strength and daring — so the fighter would shine forth and tower over the argives and win himself great glory .
she set the man ablaze , his shield and helmet flaming with tireless fire like the star that flames at harvest , bathed in the ocean , rising up to outshine all other stars .
her shield of lightning dazzling , swirling around her , headlong on athena swept through the argive armies , driving soldiers harder , lashing the fighting-fury in each achaean 's heart — no stopping them now , mad for war and struggle .
there was a trojan , dares , a decent , wealthy man , the god hephaestus ' priest who had bred two sons , phegeus and idaeus , trained for every foray .
breaking ranks they rushed ahead in their chariot , charging diomedes already dismounted , rearing up on foot .
they went for each other fast , close range — phegeus hurled first , his spear 's shadow flew and over tydides ' left shoulder the tip passed and never touched his body .
here 's some advice , not to be tossed aside , and i will tell it clearly .
come , up you go in our chariot , give ground now !
idaeus leapt , abandoned the handsome car but did not dare to stand and defend his dead brother — and not even so would he have fled his black death but the god of fire swept him off and saved him , shrouding the man in night so the old priest would not be wholly crushed with one son left .
and helen spoke to him now , her soft voice welling up : my dear brother , dear to me , bitch that i am , vicious , scheming — horror to freeze the heart !
but phoebus apollo called to blazing ares , ares , ares , destroyer of men , reeking blood , stormer of ramparts , ca n't you go and drag that man from the fighting ?
he swept her up from ephyra , from the selleis river after he 'd ravaged many towns of brave young warlords bred by the gods .
first agamemnon lord of men spilled the giant odius , chief of the halizonians off his car — the first to fall , as he veered away the spearhead punched his back between the shoulders , gouging his flesh and jutting out through his ribs — he fell with a crash , his armor rang against him .
as aeneas and menelaus came within arm 's reach , waving whetted spears in each other 's faces , nerved to fight it out , antilochus rushed in , tensing shoulder-to-shoulder by his captain now — and aeneas shrank from battle , fast as he was in arms , when he saw that pair of fighters side-by-side , standing their ground against him .
flat on his back he went , slamming against the ground and his killer stripped the armor brazen ares gave him .
diomedes plowed on and after him came the atridae , agamemnon and menelaus , following in their wake the great and little ajax armed in fury , idomeneus after them and idomeneus ' good aide , meriones , a match for the butcher god of war , eurypylus after them , euaemon 's gallant son , and teucer came up ninth , tensing his reflex bow and lurking under the wall of giant ajax ' shield .
then as idomeneus ' henchman stripped the corpse menelaus took scamandrius down with a sharp spear — strophius ' son , a crack marksman skilled at the hunt .
artemis taught the man herself to track and kill wild beasts , whatever breeds in the mountain woods , but the huntress showering arrows could not save him now nor the archer 's long shots , his forte in days gone by .
but euaemon 's royal son laid low his son — eurypylus , chasing hypsenor fleeing on before him , flailed with a sword , slashed the trojan 's shoulder and lopped away the massive bulk of hypsenor 's arm .
orsilochus first , then ormenus , ophelestes , daetor and chromius , princely lycophontes , polyaemon 's son amopaon and melanippus too — corpse on corpse he dropped to the earth that rears us all .
but athena , her eyes afire , grabbed the flying shaft , flicked it over the car and off it flew for nothing — and after him diomedes yelled his war cry , lunging out with his own bronze spear and pallas rammed it home , deep in ares ' bowels where the belt cinched him tight .
each one killed his man .
meges killed pedaeus , antenor 's son , a bastard boy but lovely theano nursed him with close , loving care like her own children , just to please her husband .
like a bull rising head and shoulders over the herds , a royal bull rearing over his flocks of driven cattle — so imposing was atreus ' son , so zeus made him that day , towering over fighters , looming over armies .
hector slashed eioneus ' throat with a sharp spear , ripped him under the helmet 's hammered bronze rim — his legs collapsed in death .
euaemon 's son eurypylus cut down brave hypsenor , son of lofty dolopion , a man the trojans made scamander 's priest and worshipped like a god .
should he draw the long sharp sword slung at his hip , thrust through the ranks and kill agamemnon now ?
the bloody arm dropped to the earth , and red death came plunging down his eyes , and the strong force of fate .
ares there — and for all his war cries diomedes shrank at the sight , as a man at a loss , helpless , crossing a vast plain halts short at a river rapids surging out to sea , takes one look at the water roaring up in foam and springs back with a leap .
how shameful for you , the high and mighty commander , to lead the sons of achaea into bloody slaughter !
for i , i gave you this , all of my own free will but hardly willing .
and lycaon 's shining son took up the challenge : aeneas , counselor of the trojans armed in bronze , he looks like tydeus ' son to me in every way — i know his shield , the hollow eyes of his visor , his team , i 've watched them closely .
quickly he trained his reflex bow on diomedes charging straight ahead — he shot !
sweat from under the heavy buckler 's flat strap had rubbed him raw , he was chafed and his arm ached from lifting up the strap , wiping off the blood and the dark clots .
athena halted beside him , let her challenge fly : here 's glory , son of lycaon — let me tempt you , you with your archer 's skill !
now he 'd never welcome his two sons home from war , alive in the flesh , and distant kin would carve apart their birthright .
the shining son of lycaon made the choice : take up the reins yourself , aeneas .
nor did his team go long without a master , hector found one quickly — iphitus ' daring son , archeptolemus — mounted him up behind his racers , thrust the reins in the fighting driver 's hands .
down from the car , my friend , pull this wretched arrow from my shoulder !
but diomedes lord of the war cry answered , right , old soldier — all you say is true .
but giant ajax would never fail his fallen brother — he ran to straddle and hide him with his shield as a brace of comrades shouldered up the fighter : echius ' son mecisteus helping good alastor bore him back to the hollow warships , groaning hard .
once they gained the spot where the most and bravest stood , flanking strong diomedes breaker of wild stallions — massed like a pride of lions tearing raw flesh or ramping boars whose fury never flags — the white-armed goddess hera rose and shouted loud as the brazen voice of great-lunged stentor who cries out with the blast of fifty other men , shame !
three times he charged , frenzied to bring him down , three times apollo battered his gleaming shield back — then at tydides ' fourth assault like something superhuman , the archer who strikes from worlds away shrieked out — a voice of terror — think , diomedes , shrink back now !
quick with another arrow , the archer let fly from his bowstring straight for hector , his spirit straining to hit him — shot and missed again as apollo skewed his shaft — but he leveled archeptolemus , hector 's daring driver charging headlong , caught him square in the chest beside the nipple and off his car he pitched as his horses balked , rearing , pawing the air .
but not the trojans , no .
god forbid they panic , skittish with fear , buck and never pull us out of the fighting , missing your own voice as tydeus ' son attacks — he 'll kill us both and drive them off as prizes .
aeneas straddled the body — proud in his fighting power like some lion — shielded the corpse with spear and round buckler , burning to kill off any man who met him face-to-face and he loosed a bloodcurdling cry .
as he tried to mount behind his team the famous spearman stabbed a heavy javelin deep in his right shoulder — he dropped from his war-car , gripped by the hateful dark .
so now menelaus drew his sword with silver studs and hoisting the weapon high , brought it crashing down on the helmet ridge but the blade smashed where it struck — jagged shatters flying — it dropped from atrides ' hand and the hero cried out , scanning the blank skies , father zeus — no god 's more deadly than you !
so hector prayed and placed his son in the arms of his loving wife .
and now glaucus son of hippolochus and tydeus ' son diomedes met in the no man 's land between both armies : burning for battle , closing , squaring off and the lord of the war cry diomedes opened up , who are you , my fine friend ?
but destiny guided amphius on , a comrade sworn to the cause of priam and all of priam 's sons .
as a lion charges cattle , calves and heifers browsing the deep glades and snaps their necks , so tydides pitched them both from the chariot , gave them a mauling — gave them little choice — quickly stripped their gear and passed their team to his men to lash back to the ships .
their power 's enormous — one 's a master archer , pandarus , son of lycaon , so he boasts .
who can stand against you ?
and mother , who ruled under the timberline of woody placos once — he no sooner haled her here with his other plunder than he took a priceless ransom , set her free and home she went to her father 's royal halls where artemis , showering arrows , shot her down .
how they would exult , priam and priam 's sons and all the trojans .
it 's not the hour to meet your doom , not yet .
the god was just stripping giant periphas bare , the aetolians ' best fighter , ochesius ' noble son — the blood-smeared ares was tearing off his gear but athena donned the dark helmet of death so not even stark ares could see her now .
so straight to the king she went , blurting out her lies : ' i wish you 'd die , proetus , if you do n't kill bellerophon !
and here i am , no chariot , no team to speed me on .
but back in lycaon 's halls are eleven war-cars , beauties all , fresh from the smith and fire-new and blankets spread across them .
oh the two of us !
so all on his own diomedes charged the front , lurched to a halt before old nestor 's team and winged a flight of orders at the horseman : old soldier , these young fighters wear you down — your strength goes slack and old age dogs your steps , your driver 's worthless , your horses drag their weight .
now there would have been havoc , irreversible chaos , the trojans penned in the walls of troy like sheep , but the father of men and gods was quick to the mark .
what bad luck — to snatch this curved bow off its peg that day i marched my trojans hard to your lovely town of troy , to please prince hector .
but if i get home again and set my eyes on my native land , my wife and my fine house with the high vaulting roof , let some stranger cut my head off then and there if i do n't smash this bow and fling it in the fire — the gear i packed is worthless as the wind .
nothing can stop it now .
i tell you this , and it would have come to pass : once my lightning had blasted you in your chariot , you could never have returned to mount olympus where the immortals make their home .
do — they 're your team , they 'll haul your curving chariot so much better under the driver they know best if we have to beat retreat from diomedes .
they 'll sweep us back to the city , back to safety if zeus hands tydeus ' son the glory once again .
where 's andromache gone ?
i 'll dismount from the car and fight on foot — or you engage the man and leave the team to me .
here is father 's threat — he will fulfill it too : he 'll maim your racers for you , right beneath their yokes , and you two goddesses , he 'll hurl you from your chariot , smash your car , and not once in the course of ten slow wheeling years will you heal the wounds his lightning bolt rips open !
now for a spear — we 'll see if this can kill you !
quickly — let each fighter sharpen his spear well , balance his shield well , feed his horses well with plenty of grain to build their racing speed — each man look well to his chariot 's running order , nerve himself for combat now , so all day long we can last out the grueling duels of ares !
your great father destroyed the sacred heights of troy , thanks , of course , to a man 's stupidity , proud laomedon .
and king agamemnon , thrilled at the sight of teucer whipping arrows off his bow , reaping the trojan ranks , strode up and sang his praises : teucer , lovely soldier , telamon 's son , pride of the armies — now you 're shooting !
the gallant wife in tears , longing for him , her wedded husband , the best of the achaeans — diomedes breaker of horses .
do n't harbor it deep inside you .
too well i know that ares leads the charge .
but the thebans rose in anger , lashed their teams and packed an ambush to meet him heading back — full fifty fighters with two chiefs in the lead , hunter the son of bloodlust , strong as the gods , and killerman 's son , the gifted cutthroat slaughter .
the great goddess fiery-eyed athena set him on , that fool — does n't the son of tydeus know , down deep , the man who fights the gods does not live long ?
now let ajax take this victory , shining triumph !
what have you to fear ?
oh no , you wo n't get past me , take me in that way !
look , the achaean champion 's badly wounded — i shot him down , i swear he wo n't last long — if the archer really sped me here from lycia !
but he caught his breath again .
but their master hurled from the chariot , tumbling over the wheel and pitching facedown in the dust , and above him now rose menelaus , his spear 's long shadow looming .
lash your racing horses at ares first , strike him at close range , no shrinking away here before that headlong ares !
aeneas sprang down with his shield and heavy spear , fearing the argives might just drag away the corpse , somehow , somewhere .
just as diomedes hefted a boulder in his hands , a tremendous feat — no two men could hoist it , weak as men are now , but all on his own he raised it high with ease , flung it and struck aeneas ' thigh where the hipbone turns inside the pelvis , the joint they call the cup — it smashed the socket , snapped both tendons too and the jagged rock tore back the skin in shreds .
in fast reply tlepolemus raised his ashen spear and the same moment shafts flew from their hands and sarpedon hit him square across the neck , the spear went ramming through — pure agony — black night came swirling down across his eyes .
and now the prince , the captain of men aeneas would have died on the spot if zeus 's daughter had not marked him quickly , his mother aphrodite who bore him to king anchises tending cattle once .
so she mocked , and the father of gods and mortals smiled broadly , calling the golden aphrodite over : fighting is not for you , my child , the works of war .
with that , he harnessed his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car , his pair that raced the wind with their golden manes streaming on behind them , and strapping golden armor around his body , zeus himself took up his whip that coils lithe and gold and climbed aboard .
why , just now she plucked him away , she saved his life when he thought his end had come .
down he leapt from his chariot fully armed , hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines , ranging flank to flank , driving his fighters into battle , rousing grisly war — and round the trojans whirled , bracing to meet the argives face-to-face .
but they had no lust for the grind of battle now — where was the man who marched their lines to war ?
no , my friend , i have no desire to fight the blithe immortals .
but once he caught her , stalking her through the onslaught , gallant tydeus ' offspring rushed her , lunging out , thrusting his sharp spear at her soft , limp wrist and the brazen point went slashing through her flesh , tearing straight through the fresh immortal robes the graces themselves had made her with their labor .
he gouged her just where the wristbone joins the palm and immortal blood came flowing quickly from the goddess , the ichor that courses through their veins , the blessed gods — they eat no bread , they drink no shining wine , and so the gods are bloodless , so we call them deathless .
but diomedes shouted after her , shattering war cries : daughter of zeus , give up the war , your lust for carnage !
so , it 's not enough that you lure defenseless women to their ruin ?
now i think you 'll cringe at the hint of war if you get wind of battle far away .
racked with agony , her glowing flesh blood-dark .
soothing words , and with both her hands dione gently wiped the ichor from aphrodite 's arm and her wrist healed at once , her stark pain ebbed away .
and off to the left of battle she discovered ares , violent ares sitting there at ease , his long spear braced on a cloudbank , flanked by racing stallions .
save our comrade !
give me your horses — so i can reach olympus , the gods ' steep stronghold .
but cronus ' son , zeus with his shield of storm insists on embroiling me in painful struggles , futile wars of words .
and laying the victims in the chariot , noble priam climbed aboard , pulling the reins back taut .
a crack of the lash — the team plunged to a run and on the stallions flew , holding nothing back as they winged between the earth and starry skies and gaining the slopes of ida with all her springs , the mother of wild beasts , they reached gargaron peak where the grove of zeus and zeus 's smoking altar stand .
but athena , eyes bright , taking ares in hand , called the violent god away with : ares , ares , destroyer of men , reeking blood , stormer of ramparts , why not let these mortals fight it out for themselves ?
ares had to endure it , when giant ephialtes and otus , sons of aloeus , bound him in chains he could not burst , trussed him up in a brazen cauldron , thirteen months .
and then and there , menelaus , the death-stroke would have blazed before your eyes — dead at the hands of hector , a far stronger man — if argive kings had not leapt up and caught you .
and hera endured it too , that time amphitryon 's son , mighty heracles hit her deep in the right breast with a three-barbed shaft , and pain seized her , nothing calmed the pain .
how great are the pains that priam and priam 's sons have heaped on you that you rage on , relentless , forever bent on razing the well-built heights of troy ?
launch athena against him — the queen of plunder , she 's the one — his match , a marvel at bringing ares down in pain .
you could hear some trojan or achaean pleading , father zeus !
daughter of zeus whose shield is thunder , i can not let us battle the father any longer , not for mortal men .
iris , racing the wind , brushed close and whispered , come , dear girl , come quickly — so you can see what wondrous things they 're doing , stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze !
the lord of the war cry menelaus came uncalled , he knew at heart what weighed his brother down .
but once he 'd passed it round and reached the man who had scratched the stone and thrown it in the helmet — ajax bent on glory — out went his hand to take it , the herald pausing beside him dropped it in and ajax knew his mark and thrilled to see it , flung it down at his feet and shouted , friends — the lot is mine and it fills my heart with joy !
his son isander ?
we are not of the same breed , we never will be , the deathless gods and men who walk the earth .
closing quickly , coming head-to-head the son and the son 's son of zeus who marshals storms , tlepolemus opened up to taunt his enemy first : sarpedon , master strategist of the lycians , what compels you to cringe and cower here ?
and apollo lord of the silver bow and queen athena , for all the world like carrion birds , like vultures , slowly settled atop the broad towering oak sacred to zeus whose battle-shield is thunder , relishing those men .
but the lord of the silver bow devised a phantom — like aeneas to the life , wearing his very armor — and round that phantom trojans and brave achaeans went at each other , hacking the oxhides round their chests , the bucklers full and round , skin-shields , tassels flying .
antilochus marked him now , great nestor 's son went racing across the front himself , terrified for the lord of armies — what if he were killed ?
who was the first they slaughtered , who the last , the brazen god of war and hector son of priam ?
three times they have tried that point , hoping to storm troy , their best fighters led by the great and little ajax , famous idomeneus , atreus ' sons , valiant diomedes .
one would glance at a comrade , groaning , what next — battle again , more pain and grisly fighting ?
courage , come , take heart !
no doubt you bragged that you could hold your city without an army and trojan allies — all on your own , just with your sister 's husbands and your brothers .
then men who lived in aspledon , orchomenos of the minyans , fighters led by ascalaphus and ialmenus , sons of ares whom astyoche bore in actor son of azeus ' halls when the shy young girl , climbing into the upper rooms , made love with the god of war in secret , shared his strength .
but if he will not surrender her , i 'll go myself , i 'll seize her myself , with an army at my back — and all the worse for him !
so they prayed as ajax harnessed himself in burnished , gleaming bronze and once he had strapped his legs and chest in armor , out he marched like the giant god of battle wading into the wars of men when zeus drives them hard to clash and soldier on with heart-devouring hate .
but you , tydides , i stand by you as well , i guard you too .
agamemnon the lord of men did not resist .
remember the wind that scatters the dry chaff , sweeping it over the sacred threshing floor , the men winnowing hard and blond demeter culling grain from dry husk in the rough and gusting wind and under it all the heaps of chaff are piling white .
and now as the armies clashed at one strategic point they slammed their shields together , pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields ' bosses pounded hide-to-hide and the thunder of struggle roared and rocked the earth .
hera queen of the gods , daughter of giant cronus launched the work , harnessed the golden-bridled team while athena , child of zeus whose shield is thunder , letting fall her supple robe at the father 's threshold — rich brocade , stitched with her own hands ' labor — donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning , buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war .
so tydides prayed and athena heard his prayer , put spring in his limbs , his feet , his fighting hands and close beside him winged him on with a flight of orders : now take heart , diomedes , fight it out with the trojans !
and how they thrilled to see him still alive , safe , unharmed and marching back to their lines , his soul ablaze for war , but his men asked him nothing .
you must have something better than this to say .
tlepolemus — far across the lines the armed achaeans hauled him out of the fight , and seasoned odysseus saw it , his brave spirit steady , ablaze for action now .
not till i hurl the smoke-black halls of priam headlong — torch his gates to blazing rubble — rip the tunic of hector and slash his heroic chest to ribbons with my bronze — and a ruck of comrades round him , groveling facedown , gnaw their own earth !
why , they 'd scuttle home before they can even learn if the vows of zeus with his dark cloudy shield are false or not .
now be men , my friends , call up your battle-fury !
so he will say and the fresh grief will swell your heart once more , widowed , robbed of the one man strong enough to fight off your day of slavery .
to stand up bravely , always to fight in the front ranks of trojan soldiers , winning my father great glory , glory for myself .
now giant ajax speared him through the belt , deep in the guts the long , shadowy shaft stuck and down he fell with a crash as glorious ajax rushed to strip his armor — trojans showering spears against him , points glittering round him , his shield taking repeated hits .
and someday one will say , one of the men to come , steering his oar-swept ship across the wine-dark sea , there 's the mound of a man who died in the old days , one of the brave whom glorious hector killed .
he led the men who lived in opois , cynus , calliarus , bessa and scarphe , the delightful town of augeae , tarphe and thronion down the boagrius river .
even so , we pity these argive spearmen living out their grim fates , dying in blood .
if that man takes my life with his sharp bronze blade , he will strip my gear and haul it back to his ships .
back through stakes and across the trench they fled , and hordes were cut down at the trojans ' hands — the rest , only after they reached the shipways , stood fast and shouting out to each other , flung their arms to all the immortals , each man crying out a prayer .
once they 'd dragged the bodies back to their lines they dropped the luckless twins in companions ' open arms and round they swung again to fight in the first ranks .
and next they killed pylaemenes tough as ares , a captain heading the paphlagonian shieldsmen , hot-blooded men .
menelaus the famous spearman stabbed him right where he stood , the spearpoint pounding his collarbone to splinters .
antilochus killed his charioteer and steady henchman mydon , atymnius ' strapping son , just wheeling his racers round as antilochus winged a rock and smashed his elbow — out of his grip the reins white with ivory flew and slipped to the ground and tangled in the dust .
he struck him full in the right shoulder , under the breastplate 's hollow the ripping point tore deep , shearing its way through , armor splattered with blood as pandarus triumphed , shouting over tydides wildly , move up , attack , my high-hearted trojans , lash your stallions !
he made his way through achaea 's ships and shelters , flaring his great crimson cape with a strong hand and stopped at odysseus ' huge black-bellied hull , moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings , upshore to telamonian ajax ' camp or down to achilles ' — trusting so to their arms ' power and battle-strength they 'd hauled their trim ships up on either flank .
but a god goes with him always , beating off disaster — look , that 's ares beside him now , just like a mortal !
give ground , but faces fronting the trojans always — no use trying to fight the gods in force .
so he warned as the trojans charged them , harder — and hector , lunging , leveled a pair of men who knew the joy of battle , riding a single chariot , menesthes and anchialus .
