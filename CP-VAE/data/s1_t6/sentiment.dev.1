in 1815 , m. charles-francois-bienvenu myriel was bishop of d -- -- he was an old man of about seventy-five years of age ; he had occupied the see of d -- -- since 1806 .
although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate , it will not be superfluous , if merely for the sake of exactness in all points , to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese .
true or false , that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives , and above all in their destinies , as that which they do .
m. myriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of aix ; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar . it was said that his father , destining him to be the heir of his own post , had married him at a very early age , eighteen or twenty , in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families .
in spite of this marriage , however , it was said that charles myriel created a great deal of talk .
he was well formed , though rather short in stature , elegant , graceful , intelligent ; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry .
the revolution came ; events succeeded each other with precipitation ; the parliamentary families , decimated , pursued , hunted down , were dispersed .
m. charles myriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution .
there his wife died of a malady of the chest , from which she had long suffered .
he had no children .
what took place next in the fate of m. myriel ?
the ruin of the french society of the olden days , the fall of his own family , the tragic spectacles of '93 , which were , perhaps , even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance , with the magnifying powers of terror , -- did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him ?
was he , in the midst of these distractions , these affections which absorbed his life , suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm , by striking to his heart , a man whom public catastrophes would not shake , by striking at his existence and his fortune ?
no one could have told : all that was known was , that when he returned from italy he was a priest .
in 1804 , m. myriel was the cure of b -- -- [ brignolles ] .
he was already advanced in years , and lived in a very retired manner .
about the epoch of the coronation , some petty affair connected with his curacy -- just what , is not precisely known -- took him to paris .
among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was m. le cardinal fesch .
one day , when the emperor had come to visit his uncle , the worthy cure , who was waiting in the anteroom , found himself present when his majesty passed .
napoleon , on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man , turned round and said abruptly : -who is this good man who is staring at me ?
sire , said m. myriel , you are looking at a good man , and i at a great man .
each of us can profit by it .
that very evening , the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure , and some time afterwards m. myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of d -- -what truth was there , after all , in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m. myriel 's life ?
no one knew .
very few families had been acquainted with the myriel family before the revolution .
m. myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town , where there are many mouths which talk , and very few heads which think .
he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop , and because he was a bishop .
but after all , the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only , -- noise , sayings , words ; less than words -- palabres , as the energetic language of the south expresses it .
however that may be , after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in d -- -- , all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion .
no one would have dared to mention them ; no one would have dared to recall them .
m. myriel had arrived at d -- -- accompanied by an elderly spinster , mademoiselle baptistine , who was his sister , and ten years his junior .
their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle baptistine , and named madame magloire , who , after having been the servant of m. le cure , now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur .
mademoiselle baptistine was a long , pale , thin , gentle creature ; she realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable ; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable .
she had never been pretty ; her whole life , which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds , had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency ; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness .
what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity ; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen .
she was a soul rather than a virgin .
her person seemed made of a shadow ; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex ; a little matter enclosing a light ; large eyes forever drooping ; -- a mere pretext for a soul 's remaining on the earth .
madame magloire was a little , fat , white old woman , corpulent and bustling ; always out of breath , -- in the first place , because of her activity , and in the next , because of her asthma .
on his arrival , m. myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees , which class a bishop immediately after a major-general . the mayor and the president paid the first call on him , and he , in turn , paid the first call on the general and the prefect .
the installation over , the town waited to see its bishop at work .
the episcopal palace of d -- -- adjoins the hospital .
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house , built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m. henri puget , doctor of theology of the faculty of paris , abbe of simore , who had been bishop of d -- -- in 1712. this palace was a genuine seignorial residence .
everything about it had a grand air , -- the apartments of the bishop , the drawing-rooms , the chambers , the principal courtyard , which was very large , with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion , and gardens planted with magnificent trees .
in the dining-room , a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens , m. henri puget had entertained in state , on july 29 , 1714 , my lords charles brulart de genlis , archbishop ; prince d'embrun ; antoine de mesgrigny , the capuchin , bishop of grasse ; philippe de vendome , grand prior of france , abbe of saint honore de lerins ; francois de berton de crillon , bishop , baron de vence ; cesar de sabran de forcalquier , bishop , seignor of glandeve ; and jean soanen , priest of the oratory , preacher in ordinary to the king , bishop , seignor of senez . the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment ; and this memorable date , the 29th of july , 1714 , was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble .
the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story , with a small garden .
three days after his arrival , the bishop visited the hospital .
the visit ended , he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house .
monsieur the director of the hospital , said he to him , how many sick people have you at the present moment ?
twenty-six , monseigneur .
that was the number which i counted , said the bishop .
the beds , pursued the director , are very much crowded against each other .
that is what i observed .
the halls are nothing but rooms , and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them .
so it seems to me .
and then , when there is a ray of sun , the garden is very small for the convalescents .
that was what i said to myself .
in case of epidemics , -- we have had the typhus fever this year ; we had the sweating sickness two years ago , and a hundred patients at times , -- we know not what to do .
that is the thought which occurred to me .
what would you have , monseigneur ?
said the director .
one must resign one 's self .
this conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground-floor .
the bishop remained silent for a moment ; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital .
monsieur , said he , how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold ?
monseigneur 's dining-room ?
exclaimed the stupefied director .
the bishop cast a glance round the apartment , and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes .
it would hold full twenty beds , said he , as though speaking to himself .
then , raising his voice : -hold , monsieur the director of the hospital , i will tell you something .
there is evidently a mistake here .
there are thirty-six of you , in five or six small rooms .
there are three of us here , and we have room for sixty .
there is some mistake , i tell you ; you have my house , and i have yours .
give me back my house ; you are at home here .
on the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the bishop 's palace , and the bishop was settled in the hospital .
m. myriel had no property , his family having been ruined by the revolution .
his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs , which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage .
m. myriel received from the state , in his quality of bishop , a salary of fifteen thousand francs .
on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital , m. myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all , in the following manner .
we transcribe here a note made by his own hand : - m. myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of d -- -- as has been seen , he called it regulating his household expenses .
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptistine .
this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d -- -- as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop , her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church .
she simply loved and venerated him .
when he spoke , she bowed ; when he acted , she yielded her adherence .
their only servant , madame magloire , grumbled a little .
it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres , which , added to the pension of mademoiselle baptistine , made fifteen hundred francs a year .
on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted .
and when a village curate came to d -- -- , the bishop still found means to entertain him , thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire , and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine .
one day , after he had been in d -- -- about three months , the bishop said : -and still i am quite cramped with it all !
i should think so !
exclaimed madame magloire .
monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town , and for his journeys about the diocese .
it was customary for bishops in former days .
cried the bishop , you are quite right , madame magloire .
and he made his demand .
some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration , and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs , under this heading : allowance to m. the bishop for expenses of carriage , expenses of posting , and expenses of pastoral visits .
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses ; and a senator of the empire , a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the 18 brumaire , and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d -- -- , wrote to m. bigot de preameneu , the minister of public worship , a very angry and confidential note on the subject , from which we extract these authentic lines : - expenses of carriage ?
what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants ?
expenses of journeys ?
what is the use of these trips , in the first place ?
next , how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts ?
there are no roads .
no one travels otherwise than on horseback .
even the bridge between durance and chateau-arnoux can barely support ox-teams .
these priests are all thus , greedy and avaricious .
this man played the good priest when he first came .
now he does like the rest ; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise , he must have luxuries , like the bishops of the olden days .
oh , all this priesthood !
things will not go well , m. le comte , until the emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals .
down with the pope !
for my part , i am for caesar alone .
on the other hand , this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire .
good , said she to mademoiselle baptistine ; monseigneur began with other people , but he has had to wind up with himself , after all .
he has regulated all his charities .
now here are three thousand francs for us !
that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms : - such was m. myriel 's budget .
as for the chance episcopal perquisites , the fees for marriage bans , dispensations , private baptisms , sermons , benedictions , of churches or chapels , marriages , etc. , the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity , since he bestowed them on the needy .
after a time , offerings of money flowed in .
those who had and those who lacked knocked at m. myriel 's door , -- the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit .
in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress .
considerable sums of money passed through his hands , but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life , or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities .
far from it .
as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above , all was given away , so to speak , before it was received .
it was like water on dry soil ; no matter how much money he received , he never had any .
then he stripped himself .
the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters , the poor people of the country-side had selected , with a sort of affectionate instinct , among the names and prenomens of their bishop , that which had a meaning for them ; and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu [ welcome ] .
we will follow their example , and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him .
moreover , this appellation pleased him .
i like that name , said he .
bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur . we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable ; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original .
the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms .
to visit all these is quite a task .
the bishop managed to do it .
he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood , in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain , and on a donkey in the mountains .
the two old women accompanied him .
when the trip was too hard for them , he went alone .
one day he arrived at senez , which is an ancient episcopal city . he was mounted on an ass .
his purse , which was very dry at that moment , did not permit him any other equipage .
the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town , and watched him dismount from his ass , with scandalized eyes .
some of the citizens were laughing around him .
monsieur the mayor , said the bishop , and messieurs citizens , i perceive that i shock you .
you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ .
i have done so from necessity , i assure you , and not from vanity .
in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent , and talked rather than preached .
he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples .
he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district .
in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor , he said : look at the people of briancon !
they have conferred on the poor , on widows and orphans , the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else . they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined .
therefore it is a country which is blessed by god .
for a whole century , there has not been a single murderer among them .
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest , he said : look at the people of embrun !
if , at the harvest season , the father of a family has his son away on service in the army , and his daughters at service in the town , and if he is ill and incapacitated , the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation ; and on sunday , after the mass , all the inhabitants of the village -- men , women , and children -- go to the poor man 's field and do his harvesting for him , and carry his straw and his grain to his granary .
to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said : look at the mountaineers of devolny , a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years .
well , when the father of a family dies , the boys go off to seek their fortunes , leaving the property to the girls , so that they may find husbands .
to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits , and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper , he said : look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras !
there are three thousand souls of them .
it is like a little republic .
neither judge nor bailiff is known there .
the mayor does everything .
he allots the imposts , taxes each person conscientiously , judges quarrels for nothing , divides inheritances without charge , pronounces sentences gratuitously ; and he is obeyed , because he is a just man among simple men .
to villages where he found no schoolmaster , he quoted once more the people of queyras : do you know how they manage ?
since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths can not always support a teacher , they have school-masters who are paid by the whole valley , who make the round of the villages , spending a week in this one , ten days in that , and instruct them .
these teachers go to the fairs .
they are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat .
those who teach reading only have one pen ; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens ; those who teach reading , reckoning , and latin have three pens .
but what a disgrace to be ignorant !
do like the people of queyras !
thus he discoursed gravely and paternally ; in default of examples , he invented parables , going directly to the point , with few phrases and many images , which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ .
and being convinced himself , he was persuasive .
he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him . when he laughed , it was the laugh of a schoolboy .
madame magloire liked to call him your grace [ votre grandeur ] .
one day he rose from his arm-chair , and went to his library in search of a book .
this book was on one of the upper shelves . as the bishop was rather short of stature , he could not reach it .
madame magloire , said he , fetch me a chair .
my greatness [ grandeur ] does not reach as far as that shelf .
one of his distant relatives , madame la comtesse de lo , rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating , in his presence , what she designated as the expectations of her three sons .
she had numerous relatives , who were very old and near to death , and of whom her sons were the natural heirs .
the youngest of the three was to receive from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income ; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke , his uncle ; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather . the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts .
on one occasion , however , he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual , while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations .
what are you thinking about ?
i am thinking , replied the bishop , of a singular remark , which is to be found , i believe , in st. augustine , -- place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit .
at another time , on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side , wherein not only the dignities of the dead man , but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives , spread over an entire page : what a stout back death has !
what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him , and how much wit must men have , in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity !
he was gifted , on occasion , with a gentle raillery , which almost always concealed a serious meaning .
in the course of one lent , a youthful vicar came to d -- -- , and preached in the cathedral .
the subject of his sermon was charity .
he urged the rich to give to the poor , in order to avoid hell , which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable , and to win paradise , which he represented as charming and desirable .
among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant , who was somewhat of a usurer , named m. geborand , who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth , serges , and woollen galloons .
never in his whole life had m. geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch .
after the delivery of that sermon , it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral .
there were six of them to share it .
one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity , and said to his sister , with a smile , there is m. geborand purchasing paradise for a sou .
when it was a question of charity , he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal , and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection .
once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town ; there was present the marquis de champtercier , a wealthy and avaricious old man , who contrived to be , at one and the same time , an ultra-royalist and an ultra-voltairian . this variety of man has actually existed .
when the bishop came to him , he touched his arm , you must give me something , m. le marquis .
the marquis turned round and answered dryly , i have poor people of my own , monseigneur .
give them to me , replied the bishop .
one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral : - my very dear brethren , my good friends , there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in france which have but three openings ; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings , the door and one window ; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening , the door .
and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows . just put poor families , old women and little children , in those buildings , and behold the fevers and maladies which result !
god gives air to men ; the law sells it to them .
i do not blame the law , but i bless god .
in the department of the isere , in the var , in the two departments of the alpes , the hautes , and the basses , the peasants have not even wheelbarrows ; they transport their manure on the backs of men ; they have no candles , and they burn resinous sticks , and bits of rope dipped in pitch .
that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine .
they make bread for six months at one time ; they bake it with dried cow-dung .
in the winter they break this bread up with an axe , and they soak it for twenty-four hours , in order to render it eatable .
my brethren , have pity !
behold the suffering on all sides of you !
born a provencal , he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south .
he said , en be !
moussu , ses sage ?
as in lower languedoc ; onte anaras passa ?
as in the basses-alpes ; puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase , as in upper dauphine .
this pleased the people extremely , and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits .
he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains .
he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms .
as he spoke all tongues , he entered into all hearts .
moreover , he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes .
he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account .
being , as he described himself with a smile , an ex-sinner , he had none of the asperities of austerity , and he professed , with a good deal of distinctness , and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous , a doctrine which may be summed up as follows : -man has upon him his flesh , which is at once his burden and his temptation .
he drags it with him and yields to it .
he must watch it , cheek it , repress it , and obey it only at the last extremity .
there may be some fault even in this obedience ; but the fault thus committed is venial ; it is a fall , but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer .
to be a saint is the exception ; to be an upright man is the rule .
err , fall , sin if you will , but be upright .
the least possible sin is the law of man .
no sin at all is the dream of the angel .
all which is terrestrial is subject to sin .
sin is a gravitation .
he said , with a smile ; to all appearance , this is a great crime which all the world commits .
these are hypocrisies which have taken fright , and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter .
he was indulgent towards women and poor people , on whom the burden of human society rest .
he said , the faults of women , of children , of the feeble , the indigent , and the ignorant , are the fault of the husbands , the fathers , the masters , the strong , the rich , and the wise .
he said , moreover , teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible ; society is culpable , in that it does not afford instruction gratis ; it is responsible for the night which it produces .
this soul is full of shadow ; sin is therein committed .
the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin , but the person who has created the shadow .
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things : i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel .
one day he heard a criminal case , which was in preparation and on the point of trial , discussed in a drawing-room .
a wretched man , being at the end of his resources , had coined counterfeit money , out of love for a woman , and for the child which he had had by her .
counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch .
the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man .
she was held , but there were no proofs except against her .
she alone could accuse her lover , and destroy him by her confession .
she denied ; they insisted .
she persisted in her denial .
thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown .
he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover , and succeeded , by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented , in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival , and that the man was deceiving her .
thereupon , exasperated by jealousy , she denounced her lover , confessed all , proved all .
the man was ruined .
he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice .
they were relating the matter , and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate .
by bringing jealousy into play , he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath , he had educed the justice of revenge .
the bishop listened to all this in silence .
when they had finished , he inquired , -where are this man and woman to be tried ?
he went on , and where will the advocate of the crown be tried ?
a tragic event occurred at d -- -- a man was condemned to death for murder .
he was a wretched fellow , not exactly educated , not exactly ignorant , who had been a mountebank at fairs , and a writer for the public .
the town took a great interest in the trial .
on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man , the chaplain of the prison fell ill. a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments .
it seems that he refused to come , saying , that is no affair of mine .
i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task , and with that mountebank : i , too , am ill ; and besides , it is not my place .
this reply was reported to the bishop , who said , monsieur le cure is right : it is not his place ; it is mine .
he went instantly to the prison , descended to the cell of the mountebank , called him by name , took him by the hand , and spoke to him .
he passed the entire day with him , forgetful of food and sleep , praying to god for the soul of the condemned man , and praying the condemned man for his own .
he told him the best truths , which are also the most simple .
he was father , brother , friend ; he was bishop only to bless .
he taught him everything , encouraged and consoled him .
the man was on the point of dying in despair .
death was an abyss to him .
as he stood trembling on its mournful brink , he recoiled with horror .
he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent .
his condemnation , which had been a profound shock , had , in a manner , broken through , here and there , that wall which separates us from the mystery of things , and which we call life .
he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches , and beheld only darkness .
the bishop made him see light .
on the following day , when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch , the bishop was still there .
he followed him , and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck , side by side with the criminal bound with cords .
he mounted the tumbril with him , he mounted the scaffold with him .
the sufferer , who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day , was radiant .
he felt that his soul was reconciled , and he hoped in god .
the bishop embraced him , and at the moment when the knife was about to fall , he said to him : god raises from the dead him whom man slays ; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more .
pray , believe , enter into life : the father is there .
when he descended from the scaffold , there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass .
they did not know which was most worthy of admiration , his pallor or his serenity .
on his return to the humble dwelling , which he designated , with a smile , as his palace , he said to his sister , i have just officiated pontifically .
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood , there were people in the town who said , when commenting on this conduct of the bishop , it is affectation .
the populace , which perceives no jest in holy deeds , was touched , and admired him .
as for the bishop , it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine , and it was a long time before he recovered from it .
in fact , when the scaffold is there , all erected and prepared , it has something about it which produces hallucination .
one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty , one may refrain from pronouncing upon it , from saying yes or no , so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one 's own eyes : but if one encounters one of them , the shock is violent ; one is forced to decide , and to take part for or against .
some admire it , like de maistre ; others execrate it , like beccaria .
the guillotine is the concretion of the law ; it is called vindicte ; it is not neutral , and it does not permit you to remain neutral .
he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers .
all social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife .
the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry ; the scaffold is not a machine ; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood , iron and cords .
it seems as though it were a being , possessed of i know not what sombre initiative ; one would say that this piece of carpenter 's work saw , that this machine heard , that this mechanism understood , that this wood , this iron , and these cords were possessed of will .
in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise , and as though taking part in what is going on .
the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner ; it devours , it eats flesh , it drinks blood ; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter , a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted .
therefore , the impression was terrible and profound ; on the day following the execution , and on many succeeding days , the bishop appeared to be crushed .
the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared ; the phantom of social justice tormented him .
he , who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction , seemed to be reproaching himself .
at times he talked to himself , and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice .
this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved : i did not think that it was so monstrous .
it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law .
death belongs to god alone .
by what right do men touch that unknown thing ?
in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished .
nevertheless , it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution .
m. myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying .
he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor .
widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him ; he came of his own accord .
he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love , of the mother who had lost her child .
as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech .
oh , admirable consoler !
he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness , but to magnify and dignify it by hope .
he said : -have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead .
you will perceive the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven .
he knew that faith is wholesome .
he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man , by pointing out to him the resigned man , and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star .
the private life of m. myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life .
the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of d -- -- lived , would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand .
like all old men , and like the majority of thinkers , he slept little .
this brief slumber was profound .
in the morning he meditated for an hour , then he said his mass , either at the cathedral or in his own house .
his mass said , he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows .
then he set to work .
a bishop is a very busy man : he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric , who is generally a canon , and nearly every day his vicars-general . he has congregations to reprove , privileges to grant , a whole ecclesiastical library to examine , -- prayer-books , diocesan catechisms , books of hours , etc. , -- charges to write , sermons to authorize , cures and mayors to reconcile , a clerical correspondence , an administrative correspondence ; on one side the state , on the other the holy see ; and a thousand matters of business .
what time was left to him , after these thousand details of business , and his offices and his breviary , he bestowed first on the necessitous , the sick , and the afflicted ; the time which was left to him from the afflicted , the sick , and the necessitous , he devoted to work .
sometimes he dug in his garden ; again , he read or wrote .
he had but one word for both these kinds of toil ; he called them gardening .
the mind is a garden , said he .
towards mid-day , when the weather was fine , he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town , often entering lowly dwellings .
he was seen walking alone , buried in his own thoughts , his eyes cast down , supporting himself on his long cane , clad in his wadded purple garment of silk , which was very warm , wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes , and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points .
it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared .
one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it .
the children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the sun .
he bestowed his blessing , and they blessed him .
they pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything .
here and there he halted , accosted the little boys and girls , and smiled upon the mothers .
he visited the poor so long as he had any money ; when he no longer had any , he visited the rich .
as he made his cassocks last a long while , and did not wish to have it noticed , he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak .
on his return , he dined . the dinner resembled his breakfast .
at half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister , madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table .
nothing could be more frugal than this repast .
if , however , the bishop had one of his cures to supper , madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake , or with some fine game from the mountains .
every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal : the bishop did not interfere .
with that exception , his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water , and oil soup .
thus it was said in the town , when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure , he indulges in the cheer of a trappist .
after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire ; then he retired to his own room and set to writing , sometimes on loose sheets , and again on the margin of some folio .
he was a man of letters and rather learned .
he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts ; among others , a dissertation on this verse in genesis , in the beginning , the spirit of god floated upon the waters .
with this verse he compares three texts : the arabic verse which says , the winds of god blew ; flavius josephus who says , a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth ; and finally , the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos , which renders it , a wind coming from god blew upon the face of the waters .
in another dissertation , he examines the theological works of hugo , bishop of ptolemais , great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book , and establishes the fact , that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century , under the pseudonym of barleycourt .
sometimes , in the midst of his reading , no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand , he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation , whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself .
these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them .
we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton , cornwallis , and the admirals on the american station .
versailles , poincot , book-seller ; and paris , pissot , bookseller , quai des augustins .
here is the note : -oh , you who are !
ecclesiastes calls you the all-powerful ; the maccabees call you the creator ; the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty ; baruch calls you immensity ; the psalms call you wisdom and truth ; john calls you light ; the books of kings call you lord ; exodus calls you providence ; leviticus , sanctity ; esdras , justice ; the creation calls you god ; man calls you father ; but solomon calls you compassion , and that is the most beautiful of all your names .
toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor , leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor .
it is necessary that we should , in this place , give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of d -- - the house in which he lived consisted , as we have said , of a ground floor , and one story above ; three rooms on the ground floor , three chambers on the first , and an attic above .
behind the house was a garden , a quarter of an acre in extent .
the two women occupied the first floor ; the bishop was lodged below .
the first room , opening on the street , served him as dining-room , the second was his bedroom , and the third his oratory .
there was no exit possible from this oratory , except by passing through the bedroom , nor from the bedroom , without passing through the dining-room .
at the end of the suite , in the oratory , there was a detached alcove with a bed , for use in cases of hospitality .
the bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to d -- -the pharmacy of the hospital , a small building which had been added to the house , and abutted on the garden , had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar .
in addition to this , there was in the garden a stable , which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital , and in which the bishop kept two cows .
no matter what the quantity of milk they gave , he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital .
i am paying my tithes , he said .
his bedroom was tolerably large , and rather difficult to warm in bad weather .
as wood is extremely dear at d -- -- , he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed .
here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold : he called it his winter salon .
in this winter salon , as in the dining-room , there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood , and four straw-seated chairs .
in addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard , painted pink , in water colors .
out of a similar sideboard , properly draped with white napery and imitation lace , the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory .
his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of d -- -- had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for monseigneur 's oratory ; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor .
the most beautiful of altars , he said , is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking god .
in his oratory there were two straw prie-dieu , and there was an arm-chair , also in straw , in his bedroom .
when , by chance , he received seven or eight persons at one time , the prefect , or the general , or the staff of the regiment in garrison , or several pupils from the little seminary , the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable , the prie-dieu from the oratory , and the arm-chair from the bedroom : in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors .
a room was dismantled for each new guest .
it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party ; the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter , or by strolling in the garden if it was summer .
there was still another chair in the detached alcove , but the straw was half gone from it , and it had but three legs , so that it was of service only when propped against the wall .
mademoiselle baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy-chair of wood , which had formerly been gilded , and which was covered with flowered pekin ; but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window , as the staircase was too narrow ; it could not , therefore , be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture .
mademoiselle baptistine 's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet , stamped with a rose pattern , and with mahogany in swan 's neck style , with a sofa .
but this would have cost five hundred francs at least , and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years , she had ended by renouncing the idea .
however , who is there who has attained his ideal ?
nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishop 's bedchamber .
a glazed door opened on the garden ; opposite this was the bed , -- a hospital bed of iron , with a canopy of green serge ; in the shadow of the bed , behind a curtain , were the utensils of the toilet , which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world : there were two doors , one near the chimney , opening into the oratory ; the other near the bookcase , opening into the dining-room . the bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books ; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble , and habitually without fire .
in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron , ornamented above with two garlanded vases , and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf , which was a sort of episcopal luxury ; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper , with the silver worn off , fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen ; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand , loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes ; before the table an arm-chair of straw ; in front of the bed a prie-dieu , borrowed from the oratory .
two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed .
small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented , one the abbe of chaliot , bishop of saint claude ; the other , the abbe tourteau , vicar-general of agde , abbe of grand-champ , order of citeaux , diocese of chartres .
when the bishop succeeded to this apartment , after the hospital patients , he had found these portraits there , and had left them .
they were priests , and probably donors -- two reasons for respecting them .
all that he knew about these two persons was , that they had been appointed by the king , the one to his bishopric , the other to his benefice , on the same day , the 27th of april , 1785. madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust , the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper , yellowed by time , and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of grand-champ with four wafers .
at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff , which finally became so old , that , in order to avoid the expense of a new one , madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it .
this seam took the form of a cross .
the bishop often called attention to it : how delightful that is !
all the rooms in the house , without exception , those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor , were white-washed , which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals .
however , in their latter years , madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over , paintings , ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptistine , as we shall see further on .
before becoming a hospital , this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois . hence this decoration .
the chambers were paved in red bricks , which were washed every week , with straw mats in front of all the beds .
altogether , this dwelling , which was attended to by the two women , was exquisitely clean from top to bottom .
this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted .
he said , that takes nothing from the poor . it must be confessed , however , that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle , which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight , as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth .
and since we are now painting the bishop of d -- -- as he was in reality , we must add that he had said more than once , i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes .
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver , which he had inherited from a great-aunt .
these candlesticks held two wax candles , and usually figured on the bishop 's chimney-piece .
when he had any one to dinner , madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table .
in the bishop 's own chamber , at the head of his bed , there was a small cupboard , in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night .
but it is necessary to add , that the key was never removed .
the garden , which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned , was composed of four alleys in cross-form , radiating from a tank .
another walk made the circuit of the garden , and skirted the white wall which enclosed it .
these alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box .
in three of these , madame magloire cultivated vegetables ; in the fourth , the bishop had planted some flowers ; here and there stood a few fruit-trees .
madame magloire had once remarked , with a sort of gentle malice : monseigneur , you who turn everything to account , have , nevertheless , one useless plot .
madame magloire , retorted the bishop , you are mistaken .
the beautiful is as useful as the useful .
he added after a pause , more so , perhaps .
this plot , consisting of three or four beds , occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books .
he liked to pass an hour or two there , trimming , hoeing , and making holes here and there in the earth , into which he dropped seeds .
he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him .
moreover , he made no pretensions to botany ; he ignored groups and consistency ; he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method ; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons , nor with jussieu against linnaeus . he did not study plants ; he loved flowers .
he respected learned men greatly ; he respected the ignorant still more ; and , without ever failing in these two respects , he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green .
the house had not a single door which could be locked .
the door of the dining-room , which , as we have said , opened directly on the cathedral square , had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison .
the bishop had had all this ironwork removed , and this door was never fastened , either by night or by day , with anything except the latch .
all that the first passerby had to do at any hour , was to give it a push .
at first , the two women had been very much tried by this door , which was never fastened , but monsieur de d -- -- had said to them , have bolts put on your rooms , if that will please you .
they had ended by sharing his confidence , or by at least acting as though they shared it .
madame magloire alone had frights from time to time .
as for the bishop , his thought can be found explained , or at least indicated , in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible , this is the shade of difference : the door of the physician should never be shut , the door of the priest should always be open .
on another book , entitled philosophy of the medical science , he had written this other note : am not i a physician like them ?
i also have my patients , and then , too , i have some whom i call my unfortunates .
again he wrote : do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you .
the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter .
it chanced that a worthy cure , i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierry , took it into his head to ask him one day , probably at the instigation of madame magloire , whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion , to a certain extent , in leaving his door unfastened day and night , at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter , and whether , in short , he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded .
the bishop touched his shoulder , with gentle gravity , and said to him , nisi dominus custodierit domum , in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam , unless the lord guard the house , in vain do they watch who guard it .
then he spoke of something else .
he was fond of saying , there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons , -- only , he added , ours must be tranquil .
it is here that a fact falls naturally into place , which we must not omit , because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the bishop of d -- -- was .
after the destruction of the band of gaspard bes , who had infested the gorges of ollioules , one of his lieutenants , cravatte , took refuge in the mountains .
he concealed himself for some time with his bandits , the remnant of gaspard bes 's troop , in the county of nice ; then he made his way to piedmont , and suddenly reappeared in france , in the vicinity of barcelonette .
he was first seen at jauziers , then at tuiles .
he hid himself in the caverns of the joug-de-l'aigle , and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and ubayette .
he even pushed as far as embrun , entered the cathedral one night , and despoiled the sacristy .
his highway robberies laid waste the country-side .
the gendarmes were set on his track , but in vain .
he always escaped ; sometimes he resisted by main force .
he was a bold wretch .
in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived . he was making his circuit to chastelar .
the mayor came to meet him , and urged him to retrace his steps .
cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as arche , and beyond ; there was danger even with an escort ; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose .
therefore , said the bishop , i intend to go without escort .
you do not really mean that , monseigneur !
exclaimed the mayor .
i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes , and shall set out in an hour .
monseigneur , you will not do that !
there exists yonder in the mountains , said the bishop , a tiny community no bigger than that , which i have not seen for three years .
they are my good friends , those gentle and honest shepherds .
they own one goat out of every thirty that they tend .
they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors , and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes .
they need to be told of the good god now and then .
what would they say to a bishop who was afraid ?
what would they say if i did not go ?
but the brigands , monseigneur ?
hold , said the bishop , i must think of that .
you are right .
i may meet them .
they , too , need to be told of the good god .
but , monseigneur , there is a band of them !
a flock of wolves !
monsieur le maire , it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd .
who knows the ways of providence ?
they will rob you , monseigneur .
i have nothing .
they will kill you .
an old goodman of a priest , who passes along mumbling his prayers ?
to what purpose ?
oh , mon dieu !
what if you should meet them !
i should beg alms of them for my poor .
do not go , monseigneur .
you are risking your life !
monsieur le maire , said the bishop , is that really all ?
i am not in the world to guard my own life , but to guard souls .
they had to allow him to do as he pleased .
he set out , accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide .
his obstinacy was bruited about the country-side , and caused great consternation .
he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire .
he traversed the mountain on mule-back , encountered no one , and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends , the shepherds .
he remained there for a fortnight , preaching , administering the sacrament , teaching , exhorting .
when the time of his departure approached , he resolved to chant a te deum pontifically . he mentioned it to the cure .
but what was to be done ?
there were no episcopal ornaments .
they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy , with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace .
said the bishop .
let us announce our te deum from the pulpit , nevertheless , monsieur le cure .
things will arrange themselves .
they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood .
all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly .
while they were thus embarrassed , a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop , by two unknown horsemen , who departed on the instant .
the chest was opened ; it contained a cope of cloth of gold , a mitre ornamented with diamonds , an archbishop 's cross , a magnificent crosier , -- all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame d'embrun . in the chest was a paper , on which these words were written , from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu .
did not i say that things would come right of themselves ?
said the bishop .
then he added , with a smile , to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate , god sends the cope of an archbishop .
monseigneur , murmured the cure , throwing back his head with a smile . god -- or the devil .
the bishop looked steadily at the cure , and repeated with authority , god !
when he returned to chastelar , the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity , all along the road .
at the priest 's house in chastelar he rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire , who were waiting for him , and he said to his sister : well !
was i in the right ?
the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands , and he returns from them with his hands full .
i set out bearing only my faith in god ; i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral .
that evening , before he went to bed , he said again : let us never fear robbers nor murderers .
those are dangers from without , petty dangers .
let us fear ourselves .
prejudices are the real robbers ; vices are the real murderers .
the great dangers lie within ourselves .
what matters it what threatens our head or our purse !
let us think only of that which threatens our soul .
then , turning to his sister : sister , never a precaution on the part of the priest , against his fellow-man .
that which his fellow does , god permits .
let us confine ourselves to prayer , when we think that a danger is approaching us .
let us pray , not for ourselves , but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account .
however , such incidents were rare in his life .
we relate those of which we know ; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment .
one month of his year resembled one hour of his day .
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun , we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction .
it consisted of very handsome things , very tempting things , and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate .
stolen they had already been elsewhere . half of the adventure was completed ; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft , and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor .
however , we make no assertions on this point .
only , a rather obscure note was found among the bishop 's papers , which may bear some relation to this matter , and which is couched in these terms , the question is , to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital .
the senator above mentioned was a clever man , who had made his own way , heedless of those things which present obstacles , and which are called conscience , sworn faith , justice , duty : he had marched straight to his goal , without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest .
he was an old attorney , softened by success ; not a bad man by any means , who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons , his sons-in-law , his relations , and even to his friends , having wisely seized upon , in life , good sides , good opportunities , good windfalls .
everything else seemed to him very stupid . he was intelligent , and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus ; while he was , in reality , only a product of pigault-lebrun . he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things , and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop .
he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m. myriel himself , who listened to him .
on some semi-official occasion or other , i do not recollect what , count [ this senator ] and m. myriel were to dine with the prefect .
at dessert , the senator , who was slightly exhilarated , though still perfectly dignified , exclaimed : -egad , bishop , let 's have a discussion .
it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking .
we are two augurs .
i am going to make a confession to you .
i have a philosophy of my own .
and you are right , replied the bishop .
as one makes one 's philosophy , so one lies on it .
you are on the bed of purple , senator .
the senator was encouraged , and went on : -let us be good fellows .
good devils even , said the bishop .
i declare to you , continued the senator , that the marquis d'argens , pyrrhon , hobbes , and m. naigeon are no rascals .
i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges .
like yourself , count , interposed the bishop .
the senator resumed : -i hate diderot ; he is an ideologist , a declaimer , and a revolutionist , a believer in god at bottom , and more bigoted than voltaire . voltaire made sport of needham , and he was wrong , for needham 's eels prove that god is useless .
a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux . suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger ; you have the world .
man is the eel .
then what is the good of the eternal father ?
the jehovah hypothesis tires me , bishop .
it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people , whose reasoning is hollow .
down with that great all , which torments me !
hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace !
between you and me , and in order to empty my sack , and make confession to my pastor , as it behooves me to do , i will admit to you that i have good sense .
i am not enthusiastic over your jesus , who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity .
't is the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars .
i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf .
let us stick to nature , then .
we are at the top ; let us have a superior philosophy .
what is the advantage of being at the top , if one sees no further than the end of other people 's noses ?
let us live merrily .
life is all .
that man has another future elsewhere , on high , below , anywhere , i do n't believe ; not one single word of it .
sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me ; i must take heed to everything i do ; i must cudgel my brains over good and evil , over the just and the unjust , over the fas and the nefas .
because i shall have to render an account of my actions .
what a fine dream !
after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me .
have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand , if you can .
let us tell the truth , we who are initiated , and who have raised the veil of isis : there is no such thing as either good or evil ; there is vegetation .
let us seek the real .
let us get to the bottom of it .
we must scent out the truth ; dig in the earth for it , and seize it .
then it gives you exquisite joys .
then you grow strong , and you laugh .
i am square on the bottom , i am .
immortality , bishop , is a chance , a waiting for dead men 's shoes .
what a charming promise !
we are souls , and we shall be angels , with blue wings on our shoulder-blades .
do come to my assistance : is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star ?
we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars .
and then , besides , we shall see god .
ta , ta , ta !
what twaddle all these paradises are !
god is a nonsensical monster .
i would not say that in the moniteur , egad !
but i may whisper it among friends .
to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow .
be the dupe of the infinite !
i 'm not such a fool .
i am a nought .
i call myself monsieur le comte nought , senator .
what am i ?
a little dust collected in an organism .
what am i to do on this earth ?
the choice rests with me : suffer or enjoy .
whither will suffering lead me ?
to nothingness ; but i shall have suffered .
whither will enjoyment lead me ?
to nothingness ; but i shall have enjoyed myself .
my choice is made .
one must eat or be eaten .
it is better to be the tooth than the grass .
such is my wisdom . after which , go whither i push thee , the grave-digger is there ; the pantheon for some of us : all falls into the great hole .
this is the vanishing-point .
death is death , believe me .
i laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject .
fables of nurses ; bugaboo for children ; jehovah for men .
no ; our to-morrow is the night .
beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness .
you have been sardanapalus , you have been vincent de paul -- it makes no difference . that is the truth .
then live your life , above all things .
make use of your _i_ while you have it .
in truth , bishop , i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own , and i have my philosophers .
i do n't let myself be taken in with that nonsense .
of course , there must be something for those who are down , -- for the barefooted beggars , knife-grinders , and miserable wretches . legends , chimeras , the soul , immortality , paradise , the stars , are provided for them to swallow .
they gobble it down .
they spread it on their dry bread .
he who has nothing else has the good .
that is the least he can have .
i oppose no objection to that ; but i reserve monsieur naigeon for myself .
the good god is good for the populace .
the bishop clapped his hands .
what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism !
not every one who wants it can have it .
when one does have it , one is no longer a dupe , one does not stupidly allow one 's self to be exiled like cato , nor stoned like stephen , nor burned alive like jeanne d'arc . those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible , and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness , -- places , sinecures , dignities , power , whether well or ill acquired , lucrative recantations , useful treacheries , savory capitulations of conscience , -- and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished .
how agreeable that is !
i do not say that with reference to you , senator .
nevertheless , it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you .
you great lords have , so you say , a philosophy of your own , and for yourselves , which is exquisite , refined , accessible to the rich alone , good for all sauces , and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably .
this philosophy has been extracted from the depths , and unearthed by special seekers .
but you are good-natured princes , and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people , very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor .
in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d -- -- , and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions , their thoughts , their feminine instincts even , which are easily alarmed , to the habits and purposes of the bishop , without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them , we can not do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron , the friend of her childhood .
this letter is in our possession .
d -- -- , dec. 16 , 18 -- .
my good madam : not a day passes without our speaking of you .
it is our established custom ; but there is another reason besides .
just imagine , while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls , madam magloire has made some discoveries ; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over , would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours .
madam magloire has pulled off all the paper .
there were things beneath .
my drawing-room , which contains no furniture , and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing , is fifteen feet in height , eighteen square , with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded , and with beams , as in yours .
this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital .
and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers .
but my room is the one you ought to see .
madam magloire has discovered , under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top , some paintings , which without being good are very tolerable .
the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens , the name of which escapes me .
in short , where the roman ladies repaired on one single night .
what shall i say to you ?
i have romans , and roman ladies [ here occurs an illegible word ] , and the whole train .
madam magloire has cleaned it all off ; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired , and the whole revarnished , and my chamber will be a regular museum .
she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion .
they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them , but it is much better to give the money to the poor ; and they are very ugly besides , and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany .
i am always very happy .
my brother is so good .
he gives all he has to the poor and sick .
we are very much cramped .
the country is trying in the winter , and we really must do something for those who are in need .
we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed .
you see that these are great treats .
my brother has ways of his own .
when he talks , he says that a bishop ought to be so .
the door of our house is never fastened .
whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother 's room .
he fears nothing , even at night .
that is his sort of bravery , he says .
he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him .
he exposes himself to all sorts of dangers , and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it .
one must know how to understand him .
he goes out in the rain , he walks in the water , he travels in winter .
he fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters , nor night .
year he went quite alone into a country of robbers .
he would not take us .
he was absent for a fortnight .
on his return nothing had happened to him ; he was thought to be dead , but was perfectly well , and said , this is the way i have been robbed !
and then he opened a trunk full of jewels , all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun , which the thieves had given him .
when he returned on that occasion , i could not refrain from scolding him a little , taking care , however , not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise , so that no one might hear me .
at first i used to say to myself , there are no dangers which will stop him ; he is terrible .
now i have ended by getting used to it .
i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him .
he risks himself as he sees fit .
i carry off madam magloire , i enter my chamber , i pray for him and fall asleep .
i am at ease , because i know that if anything were to happen to him , it would be the end of me .
i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop .
it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences .
but now the habit has been acquired .
we pray together , we tremble together , and we fall asleep .
if the devil were to enter this house , he would be allowed to do so .
after all , what is there for us to fear in this house ?
there is always some one with us who is stronger than we .
the devil may pass through it , but the good god dwells here .
this suffices me .
my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me .
i understand him without his speaking , and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence .
that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul .
i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family .
you are aware that he knows everything , and that he has memories , because he is still a very good royalist .
they really are a very ancient norman family of the generalship of caen .
five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux , a jean de faux , and a thomas de faux , who were gentlemen , and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort .
the last was guy-etienne-alexandre , and was commander of a regiment , and something in the light horse of bretagne .
his daughter , marie-louise , married adrien-charles de gramont , son of the duke louis de gramont , peer of france , colonel of the french guards , and lieutenant-general of the army .
it is written faux , fauq , and faoucq .
good madame , recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative , monsieur the cardinal .
as for your dear sylvanie , she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me .
she is well , works as you would wish , and loves me .
that is all that i desire .
the souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely , and it makes me very happy .
my health is not so very bad , and yet i grow thinner every day .
farewell ; my paper is at an end , and this forces me to leave you .
a thousand good wishes .
your grand nephew is charming .
do you know that he will soon be five years old ?
yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee-caps , and he said , what has he got on his knees ?
he is a charming child !
his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room , like a carriage , and saying , hu !
as will be perceived from this letter , these two women understood how to mould themselves to the bishop 's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself .
the bishop of d -- -- , in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him , sometimes did things that were grand , bold , and magnificent , without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact .
they trembled , but they let him alone .
sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance , but never at the time , nor afterwards .
they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign , in any action once entered upon .
at certain moments , without his having occasion to mention it , when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability , so perfect was his simplicity , they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop ; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house .
they served him passively ; and if obedience consisted in disappearing , they disappeared .
they understood , with an admirable delicacy of instinct , that certain cares may be put under constraint .
thus , even when believing him to be in peril , they understood , i will not say his thought , but his nature , to such a degree that they no longer watched over him .
they confided him to god .
moreover , baptistine said , as we have just read , that her brother 's end would prove her own .
madame magloire did not say this , but she knew it .
at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages , he did a thing which , if the whole town was to be believed , was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits .
in the country near d -- -- a man lived quite alone .
this man , we will state at once , was a former member of the convention .
his name was g -- -member of the convention , g -- -- was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of d -- -- a member of the convention -- can you imagine such a thing ?
that existed from the time when people called each other thou , and when they said citizen .
this man was almost a monster .
he had not voted for the death of the king , but almost .
he was a quasi-regicide . he had been a terrible man .
how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost 's court , on the return of the legitimate princes ?
they need not have cut off his head , if you please ; clemency must be exercised , agreed ; but a good banishment for life .
an example , in short , etc .
besides , he was an atheist , like all the rest of those people .
gossip of the geese about the vulture .
was g -- -- a vulture after all ?
yes ; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his .
as he had not voted for the death of the king , he had not been included in the decrees of exile , and had been able to remain in france .
he dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city , far from any hamlet , far from any road , in some hidden turn of a very wild valley , no one knew exactly where .
he had there , it was said , a sort of field , a hole , a lair .
there were no neighbors , not even passers-by .
since he had dwelt in that valley , the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass .
nevertheless , the bishop meditated on the subject , and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention , and he said , there is a soul yonder which is lonely .
and he added , deep in his own mind , i owe him a visit .
but , let us avow it , this idea , which seemed natural at the first blush , appeared to him after a moment 's reflection , as strange , impossible , and almost repulsive .
for , at bottom , he shared the general impression , and the old member of the convention inspired him , without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself , with that sentiment which borders on hate , and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement .
still , should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil ?
but what a sheep !
the good bishop was perplexed .
sometimes he set out in that direction ; then he returned .
finally , the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd , who served the member of the convention in his hovel , had come in quest of a doctor ; that the old wretch was dying , that paralysis was gaining on him , and that he would not live over night. -- thank god !
the bishop took his staff , put on his cloak , on account of his too threadbare cassock , as we have mentioned , and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon , and set out .
the sun was setting , and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot .
with a certain beating of the heart , he recognized the fact that he was near the lair .
he strode over a ditch , leaped a hedge , made his way through a fence of dead boughs , entered a neglected paddock , took a few steps with a good deal of boldness , and suddenly , at the extremity of the waste land , and behind lofty brambles , he caught sight of the cavern .
it was a very low hut , poor , small , and clean , with a vine nailed against the outside .
near the door , in an old wheel-chair , the arm-chair of the peasants , there was a white-haired man , smiling at the sun .
near the seated man stood a young boy , the shepherd lad .
he was offering the old man a jar of milk .
while the bishop was watching him , the old man spoke : thank you , he said , i need nothing .
and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child .
the bishop stepped forward .
at the sound which he made in walking , the old man turned his head , and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life .
this is the first time since i have been here , said he , that any one has entered here .
who are you , sir ?
the bishop answered : -my name is bienvenu myriel .
i have heard that name .
are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome ?
the old man resumed with a half-smile in that case , you are my bishop ?
something of that sort .
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop , but the bishop did not take it .
the bishop confined himself to the remark : -i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed .
you certainly do not seem to me to be ill. monsieur , replied the old man , i am going to recover .
he paused , and then said : -i shall die three hours hence .
then he continued : -i am something of a doctor ; i know in what fashion the last hour draws on .
yesterday , only my feet were cold ; to-day , the chill has ascended to my knees ; now i feel it mounting to my waist ; when it reaches the heart , i shall stop .
the sun is beautiful , is it not ?
i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things .
you can talk to me ; it does not fatigue me .
you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death .
one has one 's caprices ; i should have liked to last until the dawn , but i know that i shall hardly live three hours .
it will be night then .
what does it matter , after all ?
dying is a simple affair .
one has no need of the light for that .
so be it .
i shall die by starlight .
the old man turned to the shepherd lad : -go to thy bed ; thou wert awake all last night ; thou art tired .
the child entered the hut .
the old man followed him with his eyes , and added , as though speaking to himself : -i shall die while he sleeps .
the two slumbers may be good neighbors .
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been .
he did not think he discerned god in this manner of dying ; let us say the whole , for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest : he , who on occasion , was so fond of laughing at his grace , was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur , and he was almost tempted to retort citizen .
he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity , common enough to doctors and priests , but which was not habitual with him .
this man , after all , this member of the convention , this representative of the people , had been one of the powerful ones of the earth ; for the first time in his life , probably , the bishop felt in a mood to be severe .
meanwhile , the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality , in which one could have distinguished , possibly , that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust .
the bishop , on his side , although he generally restrained his curiosity , which , in his opinion , bordered on a fault , could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which , as it did not have its course in sympathy , would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach , in connection with any other man .
a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law , even of the law of charity .
g -- -- , calm , his body almost upright , his voice vibrating , was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist .
the revolution had many of these men , proportioned to the epoch .
in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof .
though so near to his end , he preserved all the gestures of health .
in his clear glance , in his firm tone , in the robust movement of his shoulders , there was something calculated to disconcert death .
azrael , the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre , would have turned back , and thought that he had mistaken the door .
g -- -- seemed to be dying because he willed it so .
there was freedom in his agony .
his legs alone were motionless .
it was there that the shadows held him fast .
his feet were cold and dead , but his head survived with all the power of life , and seemed full of light .
g -- -- , at this solemn moment , resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below .
there was a stone there .
the bishop sat down .
the exordium was abrupt .
i congratulate you , said he , in the tone which one uses for a reprimand .
you did not vote for the death of the king , after all .
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all . the smile had quite disappeared from his face .
do not congratulate me too much , sir . i did vote for the death of the tyrant .
it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity .
what do you mean to say ?
resumed the bishop .
i mean to say that man has a tyrant , -- ignorance .
i voted for the death of that tyrant .
that tyrant engendered royalty , which is authority falsely understood , while science is authority rightly understood .
man should be governed only by science .
and conscience , added the bishop .
it is the same thing .
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us .
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language , which was very new to him .
the member of the convention resumed : -so far as louis xvi . was concerned , i said no .
i did not think that i had the right to kill a man ; but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil .
i voted the end of the tyrant , that is to say , the end of prostitution for woman , the end of slavery for man , the end of night for the child .
in voting for the republic , i voted for that .
i voted for fraternity , concord , the dawn .
i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors . the crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light .
we have caused the fall of the old world , and the old world , that vase of miseries , has become , through its upsetting upon the human race , an urn of joy .
mixed joy , said the bishop .
you may say troubled joy , and to-day , after that fatal return of the past , which is called 1814 , joy which has disappeared !
the work was incomplete , i admit : we demolished the ancient regime in deeds ; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas .
to destroy abuses is not sufficient ; customs must be modified .
the mill is there no longer ; the wind is still there .
it may be of use to demolish , but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath .
right has its wrath , bishop ; and the wrath of right is an element of progress .
in any case , and in spite of whatever may be said , the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ .
incomplete , it may be , but sublime .
it set free all the unknown social quantities ; it softened spirits , it calmed , appeased , enlightened ; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth .
it was a good thing .
the french revolution is the consecration of humanity .
the bishop could not refrain from murmuring : -yes ?
the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity , and exclaimed , so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation : -ah , there you go ; '93 !
i was expecting that word .
a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years ; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst .
you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial .
the bishop felt , without , perhaps , confessing it , that something within him had suffered extinction .
nevertheless , he put a good face on the matter .
he replied : -the judge speaks in the name of justice ; the priest speaks in the name of pity , which is nothing but a more lofty justice .
a thunderbolt should commit no error .
and he added , regarding the member of the convention steadily the while , louis xvii .
the conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishop 's arm .
let us see .
for whom do you mourn ?
is it for the innocent child ?
very good ; in that case i mourn with you .
is it for the royal child ?
to me , the brother of cartouche , an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve , until death ensued , for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche , is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv. , an innocent child , martyred in the tower of the temple , for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv .
monsieur , said the bishop , i like not this conjunction of names .
to which of the two do you object ?
a momentary silence ensued .
the bishop almost regretted having come , and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken .
the conventionary resumed : -ah , monsieur priest , you love not the crudities of the true .
christ loved them .
he seized a rod and cleared out the temple .
his scourge , full of lightnings , was a harsh speaker of truths .
when he cried , sinite parvulos , he made no distinction between the little children .
it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod . innocence , monsieur , is its own crown .
innocence has no need to be a highness .
it is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys .
that is true , said the bishop in a low voice .
i persist , continued the conventionary g -- -- you have mentioned louis xvii .
let us come to an understanding . shall we weep for all the innocent , all martyrs , all children , the lowly as well as the exalted ?
i agree to that .
but in that case , as i have told you , we must go back further than '93 , and our tears must begin before louis xvii .
i will weep with you over the children of kings , provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people .
i weep for all , said the bishop .
exclaimed conventionary g -- -- ; and if the balance must incline , let it be on the side of the people . they have been suffering longer .
another silence ensued .
the conventionary was the first to break it .
he raised himself on one elbow , took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger , as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges , and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony .
it was almost an explosion .
yes , sir , the people have been suffering a long while .
that is not all , either ; why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii .
i know you not .
ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone , never setting foot outside , and seeing no one but that child who helps me .
your name has reached me in a confused manner , it is true , and very badly pronounced , i must admit ; but that signifies nothing : clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman , the people .
by the way , i did not hear the sound of your carriage ; you have left it yonder , behind the coppice at the fork of the roads , no doubt .
i do not know you , i tell you .
you have told me that you are the bishop ; but that affords me no information as to your moral personality .
in short , i repeat my question . who are you ?
you are a bishop ; that is to say , a prince of the church , one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues , who have vast prebends , -- the bishopric of d -- -- fifteen thousand francs settled income , ten thousand in perquisites ; total , twenty-five thousand francs , -- who have kitchens , who have liveries , who make good cheer , who eat moor-hens on friday , who strut about , a lackey before , a lackey behind , in a gala coach , and who have palaces , and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot !
you are a prelate , -- revenues , palace , horses , servants , good table , all the sensualities of life ; you have this like the rest , and like the rest , you enjoy it ; it is well ; but this says either too much or too little ; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me .
to whom do i speak ?
who are you ?
the bishop hung his head and replied , vermis sum -- i am a worm .
a worm of the earth in a carriage ?
it was the conventionary 's turn to be arrogant , and the bishop 's to be humble .
the bishop resumed mildly : -so be it , sir .
but explain to me how my carriage , which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder , how my good table and the moor-hens which i eat on friday , how my twenty-five thousand francs income , how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty , and that '93 was not inexorable .
the conventionary passed his hand across his brow , as though to sweep away a cloud .
before replying to you , he said , i beseech you to pardon me .
i have just committed a wrong , sir .
you are at my house , you are my guest , i owe you courtesy .
you discuss my ideas , and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments .
your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate ; but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them .
i promise you to make no use of them in the future .
i thank you , said the bishop .
let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me .
where were we ?
what were you saying to me ?
that '93 was inexorable ?
inexorable ; yes , said the bishop .
what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine ?
what think you of bossuet chanting the te deum over the dragonnades ?
the retort was a harsh one , but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel .
the bishop quivered under it ; no reply occurred to him ; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bossuet .
the best of minds will have their fetiches , and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic .
the conventionary began to pant ; the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice ; still , there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes .
he went on : -let me say a few words more in this and that direction ; i am willing .
apart from the revolution , which , taken as a whole , is an immense human affirmation , '93 is , alas !
you think it inexorable , sir ; but what of the whole monarchy , sir ?
carrier is a bandit ; but what name do you give to montrevel ?
fouquier-tainville is a rascal ; but what is your opinion as to lamoignon-baville ?
duchene senior is ferocious ; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier ?
jourdan-coupe-tete is a monster ; but not so great a one as m. the marquis de louvois .
sir , sir , i am sorry for marie antoinette , archduchess and queen ; but i am also sorry for that poor huguenot woman , who , in 1685 , under louis the great , sir , while with a nursing infant , was bound , naked to the waist , to a stake , and the child kept at a distance ; her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish ; the little one , hungry and pale , beheld that breast and cried and agonized ; the executioner said to the woman , a mother and a nurse , abjure !
giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience .
what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to a mother ?
bear this well in mind sir : the french revolution had its reasons for existence ; its wrath will be absolved by the future ; its result is the world made better .
from its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race .
i abridge , i stop , i have too much the advantage ; moreover , i am dying .
and ceasing to gaze at the bishop , the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words : -yes , the brutalities of progress are called revolutions .
when they are over , this fact is recognized , -- that the human race has been treated harshly , but that it has progressed .
the conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop .
one remained , however , and from this intrenchment , the last resource of monseigneur bienvenu 's resistance , came forth this reply , wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning : -progress should believe in god .
good can not have an impious servitor .
he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race .
the former representative of the people made no reply .
he was seized with a fit of trembling .
he looked towards heaven , and in his glance a tear gathered slowly .
when the eyelid was full , the tear trickled down his livid cheek , and he said , almost in a stammer , quite low , and to himself , while his eyes were plunged in the depths : -o thou !
thou alone existest !
the bishop experienced an indescribable shock .
after a pause , the old man raised a finger heavenward and said : -the infinite is .
he is there .
if the infinite had no person , person would be without limit ; it would not be infinite ; in other words , it would not exist .
there is , then , an _i_ .
that _i_ of the infinite is god .
the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice , and with the shiver of ecstasy , as though he beheld some one .
when he had spoken , his eyes closed .
the effort had exhausted him .
it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him .
that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death .
the supreme moment was approaching .
the bishop understood this ; time pressed ; it was as a priest that he had come : from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion ; he gazed at those closed eyes , he took that wrinkled , aged and ice-cold hand in his , and bent over the dying man . this hour is the hour of god .
do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain ?
the conventionary opened his eyes again .
a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance .
bishop , said he , with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength , i have passed my life in meditation , study , and contemplation .
i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs .
abuses existed , i combated them ; tyrannies existed , i destroyed them ; rights and principles existed , i proclaimed and confessed them .
our territory was invaded , i defended it ; france was menaced , i offered my breast .
i was not rich ; i am poor .
i have been one of the masters of the state ; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls , which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver ; i dined in dead tree street , at twenty-two sous .
i have succored the oppressed , i have comforted the suffering .
i tore the cloth from the altar , it is true ; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country .
i have always upheld the march forward of the human race , forward towards the light , and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity .
i have , when the occasion offered , protected my own adversaries , men of your profession .
and there is at peteghem , in flanders , at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace , a convent of urbanists , the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu , which i saved in 1793. i have done my duty according to my powers , and all the good that i was able .
after which , i was hunted down , pursued , persecuted , blackened , jeered at , scorned , cursed , proscribed .
for many years past , i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me ; to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned . and i accept this isolation of hatred , without hating any one myself .
now i am eighty-six years old ; i am on the point of death .
what is it that you have come to ask of me ?
your blessing , said the bishop . and he knelt down .
when the bishop raised his head again , the face of the conventionary had become august .
he had just expired .
the bishop returned home , deeply absorbed in thoughts which can not be known to us .
he passed the whole night in prayer .
on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention g -- -- ; he contented himself with pointing heavenward .
from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers .
any allusion to that old wretch of a g -- -- caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation .
no one could say that the passage of that soul before his , and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his , did not count for something in his approach to perfection .
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries . was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop ?
there was evidently no conversion to be expected .
all those revolutionists are backsliders .
then why go there ?
what was there to be seen there ?
