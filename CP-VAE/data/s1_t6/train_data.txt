0	since he had been alone , he had placed his bed in the antechamber , in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible
0	i will pay on my return
0	for the lack of four and twenty sous , he was losing his joy , his happiness , his love !
0	hold , said he to himself , the barriere du maine will not take me far out of my way
0	and he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stood in his eye
0	this sally was not fitted to arrest the explosion of general merriment
0	meanwhile , the forgotten bells died away abruptly and all together , to the great disappointment of the lovers of bell ringing , who were listening in good faith to the peal from above the pont du change , and who went away dumbfounded , like a dog who has been offered a bone and given a stone
0	it was quite natural , that those who had the blind-alley vide-gousset , [ empty-pocket ] or the rue coupe-gorge [ cut-throat ] , for the scene of their daily labor , should have for their domicile by night the culvert of the chemin-vert , or the catch basin of hurepoix
0	i ask you , messer cicero , and messer seneca , copies of whom , all dog ’ s-eared , i behold scattered on the floor , what profits it me to know , better than any governor of the mint , or any jew on the pont aux changeurs , that a golden crown stamped with a crown is worth thirty-five unzains of twenty-five sous , and eight deniers parisis apiece , and that a crown stamped with a crescent is worth thirty-six unzains of twenty-six sous , six deniers tournois apiece , if i have not a single wretched black liard to risk on the double-six !
0	she raised her large , staring eyes to the magistrate , and replied , as though mechanically , without convulsion or agitation , --
0	that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty
0	in the first place , you are not to tell any one what you know about me
0	then he gave her a profoundly sorrowful glance and fled
0	and who , then , would forego the memory of those days of aurora and the firmament , of flowers , of gauze and of moire , when love stammers a charming slang ?
0	do you wish never to feel the prick , to do without the nuptial bed , and to brave love ? nothing more simple
0	he went out of the town , hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter
0	that village is composed of a single house , a large , square house of three stories , built of bricks dried in the sun , each side of the square five hundred feet in length , each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below , in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice , in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept ; no windows , loopholes , no doors , ladders , ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace , and from the first to the second , and from the second to the third , ladders to descend into the inner court , no doors to the chambers , trap-doors , no staircases to the chambers , ladders ; in the evening the traps are closed , the ladders are withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes ; no means of entering , a house by day , a citadel by night , eight hundred inhabitants , -- that is the village
0	no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
0	his face was turned towards the highway , his back towards the light ; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising ; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated , which imprison even the eye , and which are equivalent to four walls
0	he will be here to-morrow with cosette : how far is it from here to montfermeil ?
0	nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe ; tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon ; je prenais le bol de terre de pipe , et je te donnais le tasse en japon
0	at that epoch , m mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age
0	everything becomes a mental conception
0	this question , highly imprudent at the moment when eustache put it , aroused mahiette ’ s attention
0	but , at the same time certain facts arise , compel recognition , and knock at the door in their turn
0	saint-simon , owen , fourier , are there also , in lateral galleries
0	is she condemned to hear the fearful approach of evil through the density of the gulf , and to catch glimpses , nearer and nearer at hand , beneath the hideous water of that dragon 's head , that maw streaked with foam , and that writhing undulation of claws , swellings , and rings ?
0	insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons
0	they wanted to make a saddle-horse of him at first
0	their putrescence is evident , their stagnation is unhealthy , their fermentation infects people with fever , and etiolates them ; their multiplication becomes a plague of egypt
0	moreover , he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience , and which whispers to a man , thou art with god !
0	a laughter that is too cynical to be frank
0	we will content ourselves with the fragments of the book of hermes which we have here
0	before entering it he cast a glance behind him , from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont d'austerlitz
0	she held a letter in her hand , which she presented to marius
0	perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler
0	from the scholar , who began to seriously fear that his knee would acquire the imprint of his chin
0	three hundred and seventeen livres , five sols , seven deniers , repeated louis xi
0	in this way he came to the prefecture , then to the seminary
0	but the man in black finally recovered himself , seized the oars once more and began to row against the current
0	the one does not hinder the other
0	the goat ’ s hoofs were tied , and the king ’ s procurator resumed the thread of his eloquence
0	what takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted god , find themselves thus , at the very dawn of life , very small and in the midst of men all naked !
0	is it you , master ?
0	his father said to him : succor thenardier !
0	if you repeat this verse , you will not lose your things by theft
0	the agitated water in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents
0	once marius said to cosette : -just imagine , i thought at one time that your name was ursule
0	this being done , he began to look on tranquilly , whistling from time to time when a blackbird flitted past
0	certain strange habits : arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave , keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves , preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall-colored mantle , seeking the solitary walk , preferring the deserted street , avoiding any share in conversation , avoiding crowds and festivals , seeming at one 's ease and living poorly , having one 's key in one 's pocket , and one 's candle at the porter 's lodge , however rich one may be , entering by the side door , ascending the private staircase , -- all these insignificant singularities , fugitive folds on the surface , often proceed from a formidable foundation
0	satan has two names ; he is called satan and lying
0	the whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger ; the whole of anarchy in the gamin
0	is not that the hotel in which is enclosed the garden of the lingère du louvre ?
0	it really was a good business
0	then he turned to his acolytes of the officiality , -- behold justice enlightened at last !
0	now that they had it they did not care for it
0	i have had a beautiful escape from being hung !
0	his aged head , pale and sad , seemed to be gazing at the sky
0	a young man entered
0	and ate a bit of bread
0	you shall understand , mr
0	muttered the woman , not so loud !
0	he read everything , went to the theatres , attended the courses of public lecturers , learned the polarization of light from arago , grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which geoffrey sainte-hilaire explained the double function of the external carotid artery , and the internal , the one which makes the face , and the one which makes the brain ; he kept up with what was going on , followed science step by step , compared saint-simon with fourier , deciphered hieroglyphics , broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology , drew from memory a silkworm moth , pointed out the faulty french in the dictionary of the academy , studied puysegur and deleuze , affirmed nothing , not even miracles ; denied nothing , not even ghosts ; turned over the files of the moniteur , reflected
0	bombarda , bombance , and bambochel !
0	she should have allowed her finger nails to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her
0	m madeleine had reigned over all and directed all
0	so you know jupiter ?
0	the best way to adore god is to love one 's wife
0	what are we up to here ?
0	it is the member of the convention !
0	death is a good arrangement
0	basque addressed jean valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him : monsieur le baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below ?
0	the window was large , sufficiently elevated , garnished with venetian blinds , and with a frame in large square panes ; only these large panes were suffering from various wounds , which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage
0	at last , he had grown impatient , and , sure that there was a nest there , sure of being in luck , having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered , he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol-shot
0	now that spirit seemed to have departed ; the cathedral seemed gloomy , and gladly remained silent ; festivals and funerals had the simple peal , dry and bare , demanded by the ritual , nothing more
0	his dinner took care of itself
0	so bold men , who are tempted by every chance , have quite frequently , as we are assured , opened the holes excavated by the black man , and tried to rob the devil
0	one felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time
0	he had something of the look of sailors , who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses
0	almost at the same instant he felt himself raised by a vigorous arm
0	and they seated themselves at a table
0	in the parvis , some good women , who had their milk jugs in their hands , were pointing out to each other , with astonishment , the singular dilapidation of the great door of notre-dame , and the two solidified streams of lead in the crevices of the stone
0	a young man who used to come here
0	the same cannon , pointed against the populace , is wrong on the numberth of august , and right on the numberth of vendemiaire
0	interrupted marius , what fine name !
0	in them she drowned what brains she possessed
0	thus , the roman abbey , the philosophers ’ church , the gothic art , saxon art , the heavy , round pillar , which recalls gregory vii , the hermetic symbolism , with which nicolas flamel played the prelude to luther , papal unity , schism , saint-germain des prés , saint-jacques de la boucherie , -- all are mingled , combined , amalgamated in notre-dame
0	marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion
0	was by the grace of god , in the five and twentieth year of his reign , the emigrants were , by rights , in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence
0	leaving aside this place saint-jacques , which was , as it were , predestined , and which has always been horrible , probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard , seven and thirty years ago , was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive , where stood the building number number-number
0	on the platform of the pont-neuf , the word redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statue of henry iv
0	cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory
0	the body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the rue de la perle
0	it was the first moment in the course of many hours when he did not feel that he suffered
0	people do not say head , cried gavroche , they say nut '
0	is not this a desperate state of things ?
0	she added , as though with an effort : -the address -- you know very well !
0	cosette 's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky
0	i imitated the cannon , and went boum !
0	enter , my benefactor , repeated jondrette , rising hastily
0	a wintry gale , which mingled with the rain , blew in gusts , the patrol searched all the doorways , alleys , enclosures , and obscure nooks , and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant ; the monster , erect , motionless , staring open-eyed into the shadows , had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed ; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children
0	tis a graceful beast , more considerable no doubt , for it ’ s neatness than for its size , but ingenious , subtle , and lettered as a grammarian !
0	as he threw himself back on the bosom of the wench beside him , he exclaimed , --
0	or was it that marie had a rival in the heart of the bellringer of notre-dame , and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more beautiful ?
0	he murmured yet once more , little gervais !
0	you have money -- yes , said the man
0	clopin trouillefou had placed himself at the apex with the duke of egypt , our friend jehan , and the most daring of the scavengers
0	it was an absent one , tranquil and dejected , who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love , his lady , the secret of fate , the key of life , love
0	it is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of napoleon on horseback , glass in hand , upon the heights of rossomme , at daybreak , on june number , number
0	athwart the state , the laws , athwart prosperity and the insolence of others
0	but i recognize him !
0	sow hemp , not wheat , from issy to vanvre
0	at his own risk and peril , it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement
0	he was no longer marius , the enthusiastic dreamer , the firm , resolute , ardent man , the bold defier of fate , the brain which erected future on future , the young spirit encumbered with plans , with projects , with pride , with ideas and wishes ; he was a lost dog
0	not that he was a profound politician , nor was he borrowing trouble about the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin marguerite de bourgoyne to his cousin charles , dauphin de vienne ; nor as to how long the good understanding which had been patched up between the duke of austria and the king of france would last ; nor how the king of england would take this disdain of his daughter
0	the nuns of the petit-picpus did not wear this holy sacrament
0	amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet
0	as he grew up , he had found nothing but hatred around him
0	cried jehan du m moulin
0	the place du parvis notre-dame , upon which the balcony looked , as the reader knows , presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle which caused the fright of the timid fleur-de-lys to change its nature
0	old age goes towards the end
0	she is dying , said jondrette
0	and he flung into his wife 's apron the five-franc piece which the philanthropist had left with him
0	then he called gavroche : -here you !
0	you see , sir , she pursued , assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien , i am willing that the child should play ; i do not oppose it , but it is good for once , because you are generous
0	unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the rue plumet
0	is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one 's malady ?
0	one may smile at it , but one can neither despise nor hate it
0	the gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion
0	when jean valjean left the bishop 's house , he was , as we have seen , quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto
0	yet she still loved him sincerely , and he felt it
0	madame de stael had died a year previously
0	it is necessary to be majestic
0	jean valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis
0	we have just explained that , in the fifteenth century , this ship was anchored to the two banks of the river by five bridges
0	we will open the vault , we will lower the coffin , and we will close the vault again
0	are we in any great danger ?
0	in the meantime , they remedy this defect as best they may ; they manage to discover where the holes are located in the vent of a cannon , by means of a searcher
0	while chatting thus , the three worthy _bourgeoises_ had arrived at the place de grève
0	he had also hinted at being a baron , but this had produced no effect on cosette
0	the primary school imposed on all , the secondary school offered to all , that is the law
0	sometimes he is clad in a handsome golden robe , figured after the turkish fashion
0	the bald member of the group was the son of this lesgle , or legle , and he signed himself , legle [ de meaux ]
0	jehan clapped his hands
0	in that case , do not enter our order !
0	oh ! -- there is a decree of parliament which gives you back to the scaffold
0	strong as his nature was , the absence of marius had wrought some change in him
0	that 's not what i want , pack of rascals that they are , it 's money !
0	he settled his cap more firmly on his brow , sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse , advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel
0	why , i should be a blackguard !
0	the first was , that he now had a horror of that house , where he had beheld , so close at hand , and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development , a social deformity which is , perhaps , even more terrible than the wicked rich man , the wicked poor man
0	everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd ; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible
0	rise , if you will , but let it be that you may grow great
0	will they take my child from me like this ?
0	we have our pope of fools at ghent also ; we ’ re not behindhand in that , cross of god !
0	i think the old dame is getting confused !
0	nearly the whole of the descent of the market-gardeners from montreuil , from charonne , from vincennes , and from bercy to the markets was accomplished through the rue saint-antoine
0	jean valjean 's wound had created a diversion
0	nevertheless , if the desire possesses you of putting yourself under discipline at your age , and of deciphering the formidable alphabet of the sages , come to me ; tis well , i will make the effort
0	on festival days and sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk with four places
0	it was upon the marble table that the mystery was to be enacted , as usual
0	the retreat , according to many a man versed in the art , -- though it is disputed by others , -- would have been a disorganized flight
0	at eight o'clock the emperor 's breakfast was brought to him
0	bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer ; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bahorel
0	to the left of the entrance door , on the boulevard side , at about the height of a man from the ground , a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by
0	father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action , in addition to the glory which we just mentioned , and of which he knew nothing ; in the first place it made him happy ; next , he had much less work , since it was shared
0	this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness , and the colonel , on his side , became fond of the cure
0	i love my captain
0	they always have the same faculties
0	do not call me father
0	wo not you drink a glass of wine with me ?
0	to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal
0	combeferre has said convincing things to you
0	x and , less touched , perhaps , than he ought to have been , but forced , for the last hour , to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful , gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes , upon m fauchelevent , overcome , little by little , by that lugubrious reality , and led , by the natural inclination of the situation , to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself , marius added : it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted
0	and populaces , like tyrants , require buffoons
0	all at once he turned round to claude with the agile quickness of a wagtail
0	the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded : -for whom is this letter ?
0	would he have drawn back ?
0	go to the devil !
0	i see through it
0	here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable , which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table , open folios , volumes piled upon a stool , an arm-chair heaped with clothing , a prie-dieu , and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots
0	this poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of justice , and she recompensed him by rendering him great
0	only at intervals did some little ragged boy raise himself on tiptoe as far as the ledge , and hurl into the drinking-shop , that ancient , jeering hoot , with which drunken men were then pursued : aux houls , saouls , saouls , saouls !
0	did you take a good look at that young 'un ?
0	the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of marius ' melancholy -- stop , said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides , this is her meadow
0	thenardier began to dictate : -my daughter -- the prisoner shuddered , and raised his eyes to thenardier
0	who is coming here so early in the morning ?
0	fafiot is the slang term for a bank-bill , derived from its rustling noise
0	was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine ?
0	the students crowded into the window , saluted them as they passed with sarcasms and ironical applause
0	without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of paris , in the marais , at mont-sainte-genevieve ; one in the rue menilmontant , where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges ; another near the little bridge of the hotel-dieu made with an ecossais , which had been unharnessed and overthrown , three hundred paces from the prefecture of police
0	good day , monsieur le recteur !
0	with this exception , he was in all things just , true , equitable , intelligent , humble and dignified , beneficent and kindly , which is only another sort of benevolence
0	my daughter will play in the garden
0	her eyes were glassy ; she turned pale instead of livid , and she trembled with a quiver of terror
0	it is the kick of the ass at the dying lion
0	do not expect me until the day after to-morrow
0	let us be on our guard
0	all at once , he felt some one elbow him in the dusk ; he wheeled round , and saw two young girls clad in rags , the one tall and slim , the other a little shorter , who were passing rapidly , all out of breath , in terror , and with the appearance of fleeing ; they had been coming to meet him , had not seen him , and had jostled him as they passed
0	a sewer is a cynic
0	he took a position in the stern ; and the young girl , whom the stranger inspired with an indefinable uneasiness , seated herself close to the poet
0	this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable ; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion
0	he said , moreover , teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible ; society is culpable , in that it does not afford instruction gratis ; it is responsible for the night which it produces
0	annoyed at being thus disturbed in my revery , i glanced into the square
0	he rose from his seat to depart , after a stay of three hours , and she said : what , already ?
0	the abbe sicard speaks of sister simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute massieu
0	besides this , there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament
0	the revolution of number came to a sudden halt
0	this pretended foundling is a real monster of abomination , resumed jehanne
0	it is to this that we invite it
0	there is one thing to be said about that , you see , by taking post-horses -- monsieur has his passport ?
0	said he ; but you are decidedly a spy then ?
0	she murmured , tis the icy hand of death
0	quasimodo no longer saw any light with the exception of one window in a distant edifice , whose vague and sombre profile was outlined well above the roofs , in the direction of the porte sainte-antoine
0	the man went straight to the street door , opened it , and stepped out
0	people shout to them : you are tearing up the pavements of hell !
0	old woman , said the provost , in a severe tone , deliver up to us that girl quietly
0	he leaned out over the street
0	the image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface
0	then marius calmed her : he is absent , i think
0	the slab has here been replaced by a cross-beam , against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones
0	a sort of hired man of letters !
0	tis the command which chains the devil in hell
0	jean valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back , and who knows whether marius , after having urged him on , would not have himself desired to hold him back ?
0	there , everything should be subordinated to the shortest road
0	at the first blush , the princes of europe , the owls of this dawn , shut their eyes , wounded and stupefied , and only opened them to threaten
0	he smoked a big pipe
0	here ’ s a marvellous thing , said gringoire ; but where the deuce shall i find some supper ?
0	be an honest man yourself ; remain monsieur le maire ; remain honorable and honored ; enrich the town ; nourish the indigent ; rear the orphan ; live happy , virtuous , and admired ; and , during this time , while you are here in the midst of joy and light , there will be a man who will wear your red blouse , who will bear your name in ignominy , and who will drag your chain in the galleys
0	the traveller paid to lagny
0	eternal flood and ebb of popular favor !
0	he drew near , and perceived that it was a very young child , laden with an enormous bucket of water
0	i prefer to be the head of a fly rather than the tail of a lion
0	marius 's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall
0	had he entered upon this love affair , which had ended in his marriage to cosette , without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings ?
0	this society no longer exists
0	his actors , spurred on by him , had not ceased to spout his comedy , and he had not ceased to listen to it
0	the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom , and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern
0	were all those dear , sorrowful , valiant , charming or tragic beings merely dreams ?
0	i am at the end of my finances , pursued the doctor ; and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof ; not on account of the house , which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois , but because of the paintings of jehan fourbault , which adorn its wainscoating
0	there are two hours yet to the pillory
0	do you then desire that she through whom you are alive , should die ?
0	although he was no longer young , it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong
0	he had sold an elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go thither
0	one summer evening , when louis philippe was returning home on foot , he saw a little fellow , no higher than his knee , perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of neuilly ; the king , with that good-nature which came to him from henry iv , helped the gamin , finished the pear , and gave the child a louis , saying : the pear is on that also
0	on these mattresses they had laid the wounded
0	then the two men parted
0	however , this sceptic had one fanaticism
0	fauchelevent grumbled , more to himself than to jean valjean : -there is another thing which bothers me
0	no ill-temper , no harshness
0	you promised me that you would give me anything i like -- yes !
0	it is the cellar of the blind
0	he came to the aid of m madeleine
0	until order , which is nothing else than universal peace , has been established , until harmony and unity reign , progress will have revolutions as its halting-places
0	i did wrong to spoil that gentleman 's hat
0	it is not hard to meet him
0	so charles v s wall suffered the fate of that of philip augustus
0	he thought he was putting marius on the right road , and that the child would yield
0	the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared ; the phantom of social justice tormented him
0	from year to year the child grew , and so did her wretchedness
0	the soothsayers practise it
0	all cherished some rancor against him , some for his malice , others for his ugliness
0	marius surveyed by a calm and real , although peculiar light , what passed before his eyes , even the most indifferent deeds and men ; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness
0	she fled , re-entered the house , and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more , to learn it by heart , and to dream
0	at this , monsieur le baron
0	pontmercy had ended , may we be pardoned the expression , by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor
0	in fact , what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them ?
0	the most terrible of motives , the most unanswerable of retorts -- because
0	it is in this grand hall that the court is held
0	all eyes turned to the estrade reserved for the flemish envoys
0	he was dressed in an ecclesiastical costume
0	besides , before you told me you had one which i knew
0	from time to time , a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor
0	they will ask nothing better
0	i ca not go out for lack of a coat
0	once only , on the occasion of one of these departures , she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she read : impasse de la planchette
0	you can read it , said he
0	this time it was no mirage
0	cosette was the difficulty , for she did not know how to climb a wall
0	said jupiter , a scholar has just seized the ladder
0	he had but one idea now , to die ; and he did not wish to be turned aside from it , but he reflected , in his gloomy somnambulism , that while destroying himself , he was not prohibited from saving some one else
0	it seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement
0	one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating , and to wave her white handkerchief
0	there opportunities of losing oneself abound
0	gallantry claimed her once more ; men came to see la chantefleurie ; she found customers again for her merchandise , and out of all these horrors she made baby clothes , caps and bibs , bodices with shoulder-straps of lace , and tiny bonnets of satin , without even thinking of buying herself another coverlet -- master eustache , i have already told you not to eat that cake -- it is certain that little agnes , that was the child ’ s name , a baptismal name , for it was a long time since la chantefleurie had had any surname -- it is certain that that little one was more swathed in ribbons and embroideries than a dauphiness of dauphiny !
0	every sort of gulf had opened again within him
0	i am dying , said she
0	the supreme moment was approaching
0	ponsonby destroyed , somerset remained
0	neither that illustrious england nor that august germany enter into the problem of waterloo
0	with too much haste perhaps
0	suddenly , dom claude sprang up , seized a compass and engraved in silence upon the wall in capital letters , this greek word
0	a sacred horror , perhaps , for , as we have just pointed out , he felt a quid divinum in that man
0	darkness covered the vast place de la bastille
0	that is not bad , said marius to courfeyrac , on their return to the hotel , with my fifteen francs , that makes eighty
0	speech being a breath , the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves
0	at the entrance to the rue bertin-poiree , a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers , at whose head marched marshal general cavaignac de barague
0	let us confine ourselves to prayer , when we think that a danger is approaching us
0	it sufficed for people to know that he was there , to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion
0	everywhere upon it we have the right of light , we contemplate its beauties , we lay bare its defects
0	at that hour of love , an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute , beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy , marius , the pure and seraphic marius , would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised cosette 's robe to the height of her ankle
0	the vat of trophonius contains nothing that is not in mesmer 's tub ; ergaphilas lives again in cagliostro ; the brahmin vasaphanta become incarnate in the comte de saint-germain ; the cemetery of saint-medard works quite as good miracles as the mosque of oumoumie at damascus
0	there is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way
0	let us not go too far , however ; in what concerns jean valjean , this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial
0	the boat made its way slowly towards the right shore
0	where are you going ?
0	the moon was full that night
0	i seem to have feathers under my head
0	a sound of foam was audible ; but the river could not be seen
0	we are ignorant and impious
0	perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs
0	as for cleaning out , -- that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away
0	fantine listened for a while longer , then her face clouded over , and m madeleine heard her say , in a low voice : how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter !
0	to drop hap-hazard into the gulf , from an unknown height , on what ?
0	they wished to elevate the people
0	she opened her eyes
0	the urchin took in his arms javert 's immense gun , levelled it resolutely at the giant , and fired
0	at regular distances , on the bare tables , there were large , varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks , and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish ; this was punished
0	in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner 's candlestick
0	one would suppose that six centuries separated these pillars from that door
0	the sittings generally close at six o'clock
0	oh , implacable march of human societies !
0	on leaving the convent , the archbishop mentioned it with approval , and in a whisper to m de latil , monsieur 's confessor , afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal
0	later on , every time that jean valjean needed money , he went to get it in the blaru-bottom
0	and , laying a pistol on the table , he added : the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy
0	the six pinioned ruffians were standing , and still preserved their spectral mien ; all three besmeared with black , all three masked
0	there , my gossip , he pursued , addressing master olivier , let us not get angry ; we are old friends
0	if such a hell existed , that bit of the boulevard de l'hopital might have formed the entrance to it
0	is not her name musichetta ?
0	the rain of the preceding day had not , as yet , entirely run off , and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom , and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water
0	a hasty rush troubled the deserted street ; they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus , and gavroche bounded into the barricade , all breathless , saying : -my gun !
0	these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly ; hence life and death
0	les bonapartistes a la lanterne !
0	what a fierce old fellow !
0	tis a book of pierre lombard , the master of sentences
0	it cut more often short
0	the reader will , perhaps , recall the critical situation in which we left quasimodo
0	young men have such bad taste nowadays !
0	the sound of the latch roused him
0	before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery , the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder , without uttering a word , seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands , raised them , pushed them out from the wall , balanced the long and pliant ladder , loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment , in the midst of shrieks of anguish , then suddenly , with superhuman force , hurled this cluster of men backward into the place
0	the porter 's lodge was closed
0	he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table , turned the chisel in the brazier , set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish , then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope , and bent down as though to examine something
0	it was high time
0	monsieur , said the clerk , do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning
0	the abyss is subject to these treacheries
0	nevertheless , he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong and earnest character
0	he had passed lillois and bois-seigneur-isaac
0	this spectacle had a terror of its own
0	for in his own mind , he agreed with the restoration , and like it , did not recognize his father 's claim to the title of either colonel or baron
0	as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil , he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan , depositing a burden on the ground , then taking it up and setting out again
0	these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive
0	jean valjean began by committing a blunder
0	or on his knees , said rym
0	they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front
0	hardly had the light been extinguished , when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay
0	he plunged to his heart ’ s content in evil thoughts , and in proportion as he sank deeper , he felt a satanic laugh burst forth within him
0	he kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile , and very worthy of care
0	filled is exactly the word ; certainly the bishop 's day was quite full to the brim , of good words and good deeds
0	when he had advanced fifty paces , he was obliged to halt
0	this gave each man fifteen rounds to fire
0	to have succeeded only in stretching her upon the leather bed !
0	he did not understand in the least , and opened it
0	perhaps this was only a rough draft
0	it was he who possessed the wit
0	in the bride 's trap
0	i shall call her catherine , she said
0	the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
0	the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys
0	i am the poet whose morality was presented this morning in the grand hall of the courts
0	it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously , and who was now bowing to the earth before him
0	of all , an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention , and from which he had not yet recovered , had added to his state of alarm
0	he took a fold of cosette 's sleeve and kissed it
0	i do not blame the law , but i bless god
0	he had before him that deaf and implacable house , six stories in height , which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window ; he had on his right the rather low barricade , which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie ; to pass this obstacle seemed easy , but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible
0	javert gazed at m madeleine with his candid eyes , in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible , and said in a tranquil voice : -mr mayor , i can not grant you that
0	it sometimes happens that , even contrary to principles , even contrary to liberty , equality , and fraternity , even contrary to the universal vote , even contrary to the government , by all for all , from the depths of its anguish , of its discouragements and its destitutions , of its fevers , of its distresses , of its miasmas , of its ignorances , of its darkness , that great and despairing body , the rabble , protests against , and that the populace wages battle against , the people
0	it has its buttercups and its daisies ; the grass is tall there ; the cart-horses browse there ; cords of hair , on which linen is drying , traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head ; one walks over this uncultivated land , and one 's foot dives into mole-holes
0	suppose a case : i am a traveller ; i say to the diligence , i will go on in advance ; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass
0	there are fathers who do not love their children ; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson
0	he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall , for fear of alarming her
0	let us inform ourselves of the trap
0	during the second year , precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached , it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted , without marius himself being quite aware why , and nearly six months elapsed , during which he did not set foot in the alley
0	she did not wake
0	and then , to face the worst , there was danger only for himself , and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys
0	besides this , the monarchy sometimes was in need of children , and in that case it skimmed the streets
0	he loved books ; books are cold but safe friends
0	the words passive obedience indicate this
0	is there , then , no way of forcing this door , exclaimed the king of thunes , stamping his foot
0	for the people against the people , that is the question
0	he resembled them too much for that
0	it had happened to him to hold his own against m de bonald , and even against m bengy-puy-vallee
0	we have arms , but there is no work !
0	he dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows , always in flower ; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out , loaded with birds , in the tufts of the saxon capitals ; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church ; of no other ocean than paris , roaring at their bases
0	that i will explain to you
0	they could see nothing remarkable about it , except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver , for they were hall-marked , an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns
0	was that he was also accompanied by the provost of paris and the chevalier of the watch , who appeared to be in consternation
0	he inquired of him : -what does hercle mean ?
0	each man had taken up his position for the conflict
0	it even struck him that the aged cynic , as he hobbled along past him , addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink , as though some chance had created an understanding between them , and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together
0	in the midst of his torments , and long before this , he had discontinued his work , and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work ; it is a habit which vanishes
0	you saved my life , said the man
0	waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century
0	every good quality tends towards a defect ; economy borders on avarice , the generous man is next door to the prodigal , the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart ; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted ; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in diogenes ' cloak
0	the gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively
0	the two little ones followed mechanically , holding each other by the hand
0	the one who was in advance was trying to get away , the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other
0	a sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality , and that they feel , even among thinkers and dreamers , some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of
0	i get down at vernon , in order to take the branch coach for gaillon
0	the result of this council held by the watch dogs was , that they had been mistaken , that there had been no noise , that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer , that it would only be a waste of time , but that they ought to hasten towards saint-merry ; that if there was anything to do , and any bousingot to track out , it was in that quarter
0	then he said to himself : but this signifies nothing ; there is nothing written here
0	retorted the boy , where 's my father ?
0	i was obliged to renounce the profession of author
0	however , apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch , boulatruelle put things together and made calculations
0	for the gillenormands , pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague
0	all the young girls raised their eyes
0	each creature had his pasture or his mess
0	et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire !
0	that which is terror by night is curiosity by day
0	has he abandoned his dice ?
0	the crowd hurled itself towards them , and they already beheld the frail wooden railing , which separated them from it , giving way and bending before the pressure of the throng
0	father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting
0	the big girl approached and laid her hand in her father 's
0	hence he took great care to conceal his deafness from the eyes of all , and he generally succeeded so well that he had reached the point of deluding himself , which is , by the way , easier than is supposed
0	bury a crown to unearth a sou !
0	two large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride , the first for m gillenormand , the other for jean valjean
0	by a good distribution , not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood
0	a woman with gray hair said to us : i was there
0	in order to extricate himself from the predicament , he took the simplest course ; he lied abominably
0	the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half-filled by a fence of rotten boards , shored up by five stone posts
0	the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones , and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
0	the immensity of night was facing this tiny creature
0	this book was on one of the upper shelves
0	and then , gringoire held the position of her brother , if not of her husband
0	montparnasse watched him with amazement , as he disappeared in the dusk
0	these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony
0	he found dom claude greatly changed ; pale as a winter ’ s morning , with hollow eyes , and hair almost white
0	i offer you a cutlet and you answer me : by the way , i want to marry
0	my friends , long live women !
0	but in proportion as his youth disappeared , gayety was kindled ; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries , his hair with mirth , his health with irony , his weeping eye laughed incessantly
0	i like this better , said m gillenormand
0	he said to himself with a sort of joy that -- it was certainly the least he could do ; that it was an expiation ; -- that , had it not been for that , he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father , and such a father !
0	there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing
0	cosette drew from the envelope its contents , a little notebook of paper , each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting , as cosette thought
0	at every blow dealt by the formidable rabbi , from the depths of his cell , upon this nail , that one of his enemies whom he had condemned , were he a thousand leagues away , was buried a cubit deep in the earth which swallowed him
0	a word was sufficient for him , sometimes a sign ; the mastodon obeyed
0	if you succeed in removing the purse without our hearing the bells , you are a vagabond , and you will be thrashed for eight consecutive days
0	the streets were invested , the church backed on the river
0	and he offered the two newspapers , unfolded , to marius , the reader is acquainted with these two papers
0	was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist , and who would come to visit his butterfly ?
0	if your majesty does not send prompt succor to the bailiff , he is lost
0	his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
0	for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light
0	without doubt , this strange beacon light would awaken far away , the woodcutter of the hills of bicêtre , terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre-dame quivering over his heaths
0	then there would be an unpleasant scene ; a recrudescence of family questions , a confrontation of positions , every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time , fauchelevent , coupelevent , fortune , poverty , a stone about his neck , the future
0	i can bear the comparison !
0	it was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child , not yet six years old , shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen , full of holes , sweeping the street before daylight , with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands , and a tear in her great eyes
0	thus it will be easily understood that that grating , so obligingly opened to jean valjean , was a bit of cleverness on thenardier 's part
0	what was it that he did ?
0	she was conscious of marius ' will in the direction of monsieur jean , she conformed to it
0	he appeared to have grown thin and pale
0	what shall i do until then ?
0	it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard , when they ran short of children , took those who had fathers
0	at the same time , a sort of pale , thin , small , freckled , and youthful artisan , clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet , and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man , emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman 's voice : -monsieur marius , if you please
0	sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher 's shop on the corner , in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him , an awkward young man , carrying big books under his arm , who had a timid yet angry air , who , on entering , removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration , made a profound bow to the butcher 's astonished wife , asked for a mutton cutlet , paid six or seven sous for it , wrapped it up in a paper , put it under his arm , between two books , and went away
0	my soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas
0	a few moments later , the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents , who had taken refuge at the top of the house
0	and then , from morning till night , i have the happiness of passing all my days with a man of genius , who is myself , which is very agreeable
0	these are the terms of his deposition : i do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner 's denial
0	have a care , nemorin , thou art too handsome !
0	fantine , by appearing thus abruptly in his revery , produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light ; it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect : he exclaimed : -ah !
0	she told herself that she was not sure of anything , that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost ; and the idea that marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful
0	and she began to pace up and down with long strides before the grating of her window , her hair dishevelled , her eyes flashing , with her shoulder striking against the wall , with the wild air of a female wolf in a cage , who has long been famished , and who feels the hour for her repast drawing near
0	the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm , the others turned away , each according to his nature
0	fantine had become terrible
0	volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth
0	they say she is a sorceress , and that her goat executes very miraculous tricks
0	the little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing
0	did those thenardiers keep her clean ?
0	then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking , moving , becoming endued with animation , that it was alive ; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw , which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula , and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious elephant , which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet , its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings
0	at that moment , a ragged child who was coming down through the rue menilmontant , holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville , caught sight of an old holster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-a-brac merchant 's shop
0	it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with laffitte , with this peculiar feature , that they were always at his immediate disposal , so that , it was added , m madeleine could make his appearance at laffitte 's any morning , sign a receipt , and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes
0	in a bee-line , through the underbrush , which is peculiarly dense , very thorny , and very aggressive in that locality , a full half hour was necessary
0	cournet made the saint-antoine barricade ; barthelemy the barricade of the temple
0	in the morning everything was dripping , in the afternoon everything is powdered over
0	she refused the cake which mahiette offered to her , and said , black bread
0	people were undergoing a transformation , almost without being conscious of it , through the movement of the age
0	one had grown up , the other had grown old
0	the worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions , without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze
0	the good woman appeared as usual
0	for mercy ’ s sake , tell me if he is alive !
0	it was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy paroquet which belonged to a lady boarder : -how well bred !
0	the marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number , according as the chief was more or less severe
0	mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him
0	his name was ultime fauchelevent
0	thus , -- and in the exaggeration of anguish , and the optical illusion of consternation , all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced , and society , and the human race , and the universe were , henceforth , summed up in his eyes , in one simple and terrible feature , -- thus the penal laws , the thing judged , the force due to legislation , the decrees of the sovereign courts , the magistracy , the government , prevention , repression , official cruelty , wisdom , legal infallibility , the principle of authority , all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security , sovereignty , justice , public truth , all this was rubbish , a shapeless mass , chaos ; he himself , javert , the spy of order , incorruptibility in the service of the police , the bull-dog providence of society , vanquished and hurled to earth ; and , erect , at the summit of all that ruin , a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow ; this was the astounding confusion to which he had come ; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul
0	one evening during that same month of april , jean valjean had gone out ; cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown
0	you were among them
0	; make him sing the marseillaise , and he will free the world
0	it was difficult to divine why
0	she went on , you have a hole in your shirt
0	to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds ?
0	the light fell full on m madeleine 's face
0	this is neither a fair nor a market day
0	a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face , burned and tanned by sun and wind , and dripping with perspiration
0	this was the idea : -it is barely midnight , the rue de l'homme arme is not far off ; i will go and deliver the letter at once , and i shall get back in time
0	a sudden light made them blink ; gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats
0	then , again , from time to time , this mass of sublime noises opens and gives passage to the beats of the ave maria , which bursts forth and sparkles like an aigrette of stars
0	not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim , except to jeer at his thirst
0	towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn , a man turned from the rue saint-antoine at a run , made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july , and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant
0	louis philippe having been severely judged by some , harshly , perhaps , by others , it is quite natural that a man , himself a phantom at the present day , who knew that king , should come and testify in his favor before history ; this deposition , whatever else it may be , is evidently and above all things , entirely disinterested ; an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere ; one shade may console another shade ; the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it ; it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile : this one flattered the other
0	only , a civilizing people should remain a manly people
0	it no longer expresses anything , not even the memory of the art of another time
0	the hydra of the romancero and some other hybrid forms , the vedas and the nibelungen bristle further on
0	how i would treat him to a nice respectful summons !
0	universal suffrage has this admirable property , that it dissolves riot in its inception , and , by giving the vote to insurrection , it deprives it of its arms
0	these young men were insignificant ; every one has seen such faces ; four specimens of humanity taken at random ; neither good nor bad , neither wise nor ignorant , neither geniuses nor fools ; handsome , with that charming april which is called twenty years
0	the coachman drew up in front of the carters ' inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey , to give his horses a breathing spell
0	said he , have no more fear of me than i have for you !
0	but then , why had he permitted that man to leave him alive ?
0	then his fears returned to him , the idea of an attempt against the gypsy presented itself once more to his mind
0	nevertheless , there was one human creature whom quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others , and whom he loved even more , perhaps , than his cathedral : this was claude frollo
0	we are at the top ; let us have a superior philosophy
0	the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze
0	that done , she laid it in her arms , and sang to it softly , to lull it to sleep
0	the plateau of mont-saint-jean was captured , recaptured , captured again
0	she was , on the contrary , somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual
0	what we are doing is not wholly innocent
0	when facts , the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady , move heavily , the slightest complication stops and entangles them
0	to have taken her from me thus ; you could never have looked at me with her , when i was joyously warming her at my fire , when she laughed as she suckled , when i made her tiny feet creep up my breast to my lips ?
0	this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans
0	asked m gillenormand -- because of the maskers
0	the assemblies of the friends of the a b c were usually held in a back room of the cafe musain
0	the sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the rue mondetour had no occasion to give the alarm for a single national guardsman , and he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street , saying to himself : probably it is a reinforcement , in any case it is a prisoner
0	the rue plumet , the rue plumet , did you say ? -- let us see ! -- are there not barracks in that vicinity ? -- why , yes , that 's it
0	and without the mother even having seen her child once more , almost without the child 's having known her mother ; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who , most assuredly , has deserved the galleys for something else , if not for that ; fine scruples , indeed , which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent , which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most , and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel , and which sacrifice a whole population , mothers , wives , children
0	the circling dances of the numberth of july effaced the enthusiasms of the numberth of march
0	amen , said fauchelevent , who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma , whenever he heard latin
0	her person seemed made of a shadow ; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex ; a little matter enclosing a light ; large eyes forever drooping ; -- a mere pretext for a soul 's remaining on the earth
0	aumarais lane was called maugout lane ; the rue droit-mur was called the rue des eglantiers , for god opened flowers before man cut stones
0	he placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger , crossed his arms and said : -i am the one to pay !
0	but there might have been some one there
0	although a bourgeois , m gillenormand was received in society
0	they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house
0	that gypsy girl you know , who comes every day to dance on the church square , in spite of the official ’ s prohibition !
0	the smile was still mingled with it for a time , but was bitter , discouraged , profoundly sad
0	the line of battle waves and undulates like a thread , the trails of blood gush illogically , the fronts of the armies waver , the regiments form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw ; all these reefs are continually moving in front of each other
0	only , it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump , simply by the utterance of the word , mind
0	this what i wanted to say ; i could not find words for it at first
0	the monastery is the product of the formula : equality , fraternity
0	[ number ] diplomatic ciphers are slang ; the pontifical chancellery by using number for rome , grkztntgzyal for despatch , and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu xi
0	that which we admire above all , in an encounter of the nature of waterloo , is the marvellous cleverness of chance
0	it is more than progress ; it is transmutation
0	this was the situation of marius ' mind
0	this species of weather-vane which looked upon the pavement was the signboard
0	neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment
0	i tell you , sir , that the end of the world has come
0	then he added : perhaps my thoughts reach her also
0	joy never , ecstasy forever
0	the most puzzled were the school-master and thenardier , the proprietor of the tavern , who was everybody 's friend , and had not disdained to ally himself with boulatruelle
0	it was mistaken ; it formed a part of the past , but the whole past was france
0	item , one must live !
0	are not her hands perfect ?
0	he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan
0	no light in the windows ; the shades were drawn ; the third floor was totally dark
0	no , replied the girl , but as his key is in the door , he must be out
0	the printed book , the gnawing worm of the edifice , sucks and devours it
0	the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul , and never of love , very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame
0	like him , she had a mustache
0	this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything
0	that he had thus two condemned creatures attached to him ; that his companion asked no better than to take charge of the gypsy
0	it 's i , said he
0	this should not be , gamins
0	i feel that her whole soul lies within it !
0	that changes you , remarked gavroche , you are less homely so , you ought to keep them on all the time
0	some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity
0	djali raised his little gilt hoof , and struck six blows on the tambourine
0	it has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read
0	the lady was asleep
0	the silence which he preserved allowed the prologue to proceed without hindrance , and no perceptible disorder would have ensued , if ill-luck had not willed that the scholar joannes should catch sight , from the heights of his pillar , of the mendicant and his grimaces
0	what is the cat ?
0	jean valjean played the part of fire , and that is what he should have done , and have freed his house from that man
0	he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room
0	workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in the rue de cotte
0	i strolled into the village , and perceived that it was a town
0	tis a time for living , or jupiter is only a scamp !
0	he witnesses , amid his death-pangs , the immense madness of the sea
0	monsieur , said he , how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold ?
0	a little street , the rue du chemin-vert-saint-antoine , opened out between two timber-yards enclosed in walls
0	so you were telling me to return ?
0	jean valjean loved to haunt these fields
0	he threw himself into one of the arm-chairs
0	the trousers would go next
0	he replied with some embarrassment : -ah !
0	thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts , he dropped his head
0	you think so , master coppenole ?
0	women play with their beauty as children do with a knife
0	hence arose a profound trouble
0	it was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant
0	one step more and she would be in the street
0	keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand
0	these two little creatures were evidently happy
0	be easy on that score , miss
0	on perceiving the sister , his first movement was to retire
0	the old man 's pallid lips moved as though mechanically , and permitted the passage of words that were barely audible , like breaths in the death agony : ah !
0	she simply loved and venerated him
0	in the morning i write love letters ; in the evening i dig graves
0	cosette was somewhat vexedat the useless little effort made by her memory
0	ponsonby had fallen , riddled by seven lance-thrusts
0	who knows the ways of providence ?
0	you declare yourself to be an idler !
0	at the restoration she had turned bigot , and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk
0	it 's a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates , and where women of the town are cared for like countesses !
0	when he had , not without difficulty , repassed the fence , and found himself once more in the street , alone , without refuge , without shelter , without a roof over his head , chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel , he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone , and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim , i am not even a dog !
0	phoebus , continued the bohemian , gently releasing her waist from the captain ’ s tenacious hands , you are good , you are generous , you are handsome ; you saved me , me who am only a poor child lost in bohemia
0	carrier is a bandit ; but what name do you give to montrevel ?
0	marius took this paper and preserved it , not out of duty to his father , but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man
0	let us hasten our steps !
0	persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique
0	afterwards they had learned his name
0	the kingdom of eve
0	the thing is not uncommon
0	not an unevenness of the ground , not a caprice in the architecture , not a fold
0	he had , nevertheless , received from his family some education and some politeness of manner ; but he had been thrown on the world too young , he had been in garrison at too early an age , and every day the polish of a gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his gendarme ’ s cross-belt
0	he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man , by pointing out to him the resigned man , and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star
0	an observation here becomes necessary , in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse , and of others which will be met with further on
0	what is your pillory at reims ?
0	a barricade is mother gibou 's tea
0	but what will become of cosette ?
0	to meditate on the shadow is a serious thing
0	the young girl passed , and as she passed , she glanced at him
0	i believe tis the little esmeralda , who plays her mummeries with her goat
0	at the same time , the heavy lock creaked , the trap grated on its rusty hinges , turned , and she beheld a lantern , a hand , and the lower portions of the bodies of two men , the door being too low to admit of her seeing their heads
0	all this was contained in that battle , according to napoleon
0	in your place , i would let her alone
0	mademoiselle vaubois , perfect in her style , was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence
0	under the caesars , there was no insurrection , but there was juvenal
0	he was dreaming of her
0	he exclaimed , pushing the dagger back in haste , you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois
0	enjolras made a sign to the four men
0	thereupon , exasperated by jealousy , she denounced her lover , confessed all , proved all
0	put something in it
0	all at once he pulled her gently by the border of her sleeve
0	my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her , and my wife will come back here to tell us : it 's done
0	thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius
0	and thinking that the elder , who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation , deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite , he added , as be handed him the largest share : -ram that into your muzzle
0	of the knife , precisely , responded gringoire
0	no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet
0	what enlightenment did he need ?
0	one blocked the entrance to the faubourg saint antoine ; the other defended the approach to the faubourg du temple ; those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of june , will never forget them
0	that suits you better
0	it is in the direction of saint-merry
0	it will be remembered that the fundamental point in javert , his element , the very air he breathed , was veneration for all authority
0	isolation , detachment , from everything , pride , independence , the taste of nature , the absence of daily and material activity , the life within himself , the secret conflicts of chastity , a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation , had prepared marius for this possession which is called passion
0	the universe around them had fallen into a hole
0	phoebus , said fleur-de-lys suddenly , in a low voice , we are to be married three months hence ; swear to me that you have never loved any other woman than myself
0	then , in order to prevent cosette eating black bread , jean valjean ate white bread
0	recommended by the eighty francs , they were well cared for , as is everything from which profit is derived ; they were neither badly clothed , nor badly fed ; they were treated almost like little gentlemen , -- better by their false mother than by their real one
0	she tried to smile and could not
0	the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver
0	however , as we have just pointed out , brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom , or folly , or , as it often happens , in both at once , are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life
0	she licked the pavement
0	and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor
0	on the following day , which was the third , ma'am bougon was thunderstruck
0	this is what he thought : i am struck all of a heap
0	you know not what unhappiness is
0	he was too ugly
0	meanwhile , the lugubrious cavalcade has traversed the crowd amid cries of joy and curious attitudes
0	where do you live ?
0	now , to give the big bell in marriage to quasimodo was to give juliet to romeo
0	jean valjean , without replying , helped the insurgent whom he was saving to don his uniform
0	and then they have made it over ; a presumption of which neither time nor revolutions at least have been guilty
0	the supreme floating visions are abject
0	between eleven o'clock and midnight , you will come with your iron bar
0	still , i do not say -- you are rich ; you have the air of a very good man , -- if it were for her happiness
0	all those places which you no longer behold , which you may never behold again , perchance , and whose memory you have cherished , take on a melancholy charm , recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition , make the holy land visible to you , and are , so to speak , the very form of france , and you love them ; and you call them up as they are , as they were , and you persist in this , and you will submit to no change : for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother
0	the redoubt had been cleverly made over , into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside
0	for the one party , to advance meant death , and no one dreamed of retreating ; for the other , to remain meant death , and no one dreamed of flight
0	and now there 's the other one !
0	what do you want me to say to you ?
0	tis only necessary to be handsome on the outside !
0	meanwhile , the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold
0	finally , quite at the end of the room , near the door , in the dark , stood , motionless as a statue , a vigorous man with thickset limbs , a military harness , with a surcoat of armorial bearings , whose square face pierced with staring eyes , slit with an immense mouth , his ears concealed by two large screens of flat hair , had something about it both of the dog and the tiger
0	i am neither denounced , nor pursued , nor tracked , you say
0	good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones
0	she is my sister , she answered
0	from that moment , master coppenole enjoyed in paris as in ghent , great favor with the people ; for men of that sort do enjoy it , says philippe de comines , when they are thus disorderly
0	she approached , without uttering a syllable , the victim who writhed in a vain effort to escape her , and detaching a gourd from her girdle , she raised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man
0	what we have just written seems strange , and yet it is true
0	collectors of petty details , who become herbalists of anecdotes , and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin , know that there was in paris , during the last century , about number , two attorneys at the chatelet named , one corbeau ( raven ) , the other renard ( fox )
0	it seemed to him too , that , in one instant , he had become deaf
0	you should have completed it when you conceived it
0	guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men
0	i am to nail up the coffin
0	now listen to this ; we have a good memory
0	his gnome ’ s eye , fastened upon her , inundated her with tenderness , sadness , and pity , and was suddenly raised filled with lightnings
0	she retreated into the crowd
0	the little girl with the goat
0	at the time of the insurrection of number , in the rue saint-martin a little , infirm old man , pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored rag , in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid , went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade , offering his glasses of cocoa impartially , -- now to the government , now to anarchy
0	my brother is so good
0	of course i shall give it to you , said the mother
0	a large , deep moat , with a brisk current during the high water of winter , bathed the base of the wall round paris ; the seine furnished the water
0	they also might descend into that well and search it
0	it is faithful , brave , chivalric , loving , devoted
0	i have bread enough for her and for myself
0	after the lapse of four years !
0	by the way , added gringoire , looking at the archdeacon in a half bantering way , are you still thinking of her ?
0	then she went to seek in the corner of her cell a huge paving stone , which served her as a pillow , and launched it against them with such violence that one of the bars broke , emitting thousands of sparks
0	some one has passed through the sewer
0	and can you get a lever ?
0	get off that bed , you lazy thing !
0	we are equally far removed from the hosanna of joseph de maistre , who wound up by anointing the executioner , and from the sneer of voltaire , who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross
0	it was an impression which vanished speedily , but which was irresistible at the moment
0	at times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing , so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths
0	it was gribier 's voice
0	a long shiver traversed her frame from head to foot ; her teeth chattered ; she half raised her head and said , pressing her elbows against her hips , and clasping her feet in her hands as though to warm them , --
0	a fire was burning there ; which indicated that jean valjean 's reply : i will remain below , had been foreseen
0	the priest fancied that he perceived the form of quasimodo
0	by bending over , one could have readily recognized a coin , -- no doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little savoyard
0	what was quite unprecedented , she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her
0	surprised , intoxicated , charmed , i allowed myself to gaze upon thee
0	if the old woman could have seen him at that moment , she would have been frightened
0	all this work was performed without any hindrance , in less than an hour , and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance
0	no one has ever found out
0	i have not seen you for a long time
0	let us come to an explanation about the emperor
0	i see stars and lances of fire
0	the nile rat kills the crocodile , the swordfish kills the whale , the book will kill the edifice
0	the sewer has , nowadays , assumed a certain official aspect
0	meanwhile , mahiette was gazing with ever-increasing anxiety at that wan , withered , dishevelled head , and her eyes filled with tears
0	god produces his miracles as seems good to him
0	when javert laughed , -- and his laugh was rare and terrible , -- his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth , but his gums , and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold , as on the muzzle of a wild beast
0	hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting , when the child , with surprise , beheld the goat ( one of whose miraclesthis was no doubt ) , draw out certain letters with its golden hoof , and arrange them , with gentle pushes , in a certain order
0	they sealed each tradition beneath a monument
0	this last happiness now constituted his whole future ; after that , gloom
0	opposite this tree , which was an ash , there was a chestnut-tree , suffering from a peeling of the bark , to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing
0	he knew , from the diminution in the jolting , when they left the pavements and reached the earth road
0	i will conduct you to see the lions of the hôtel du roi , which are wild beasts
0	the saint-antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders ; the barricade of the temple was silence
0	the heap of stones , destined for no one knows what employment , which was visible there thirty years ago , is doubtless still there
0	a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the court-house , in verses that limped a little : -maitre corbeau , sur un dossier perche , [ number ] tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire ; maitre renard , par l'odeur alleche , lui fit a peu pres cette histoire : he !
0	a heap of dead bodies in the upper part , a river of blood in the lower part -- such was that road on the evening of the numberth of june , number
0	the young girl allowed phoebus to have his way
0	in the second place -- is the cabriolet for monsieur le maire ?
0	i have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the rue plumet
0	when she became silent tristan l ’ hermite frowned , but it was to conceal a tear which welled up in his tiger ’ s eye
0	there were griffins which had the air of laughing , gargoyles which one fancied one heard yelping , salamanders which puffed at the fire , tarasques which sneezed in the smoke
0	the recluse had gone and seated herself by her daughter , covering her with her body , in front of her , with staring eyes , listening to the poor child , who did not stir , but who kept murmuring in a low voice , these words only , phoebus !
0	down with the mystery !
0	master simon sanguin , the elector of picardy , with his wife on the crupper !
0	in this unknown , every step that he risked might be his last
0	wathier 's column alone had suffered in the disaster ; delort 's column , which ney had deflected to the left , as though he had a presentiment of an ambush , had arrived whole
0	such was this curious house
0	every day , she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience , she found marius there , she felt herself unspeakably happy , and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean : -what a delicious garden that luxembourg is !
0	i have enjoyed still other successes
0	as they approached the earth , these two jets of liquid lead spread out in sheaves , like water springing from the thousand holes of a watering-pot
0	on the first day he ate the meat , on the second he ate the fat , on the third he gnawed the bone
0	the revolt had enveloped everything in its smoke
0	he walked with no less indecision than cosette
0	his legs alone were motionless
0	she took note of the hour
0	when the wind cuts your face , when it freezes , it is all the same ; you must still wash
0	sister perpetue was a robust nun from marines near pontoise , who chattered her patois , droned , grumbled , sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid , treated her patients abruptly , roughly , was crabbed with the dying , almost flung god in their faces , stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage ; was bold , honest , and ruddy
0	such a thing can not be refused
0	besides , what was the use of seeing each other ?
0	by the giants of 'number
0	fear stunned the young girl
0	it was a perfect delirium
0	the flag on the dome of the tuileries was white
0	i should really like to know what your secret is , thought fleur-de-lys
0	yes , truly , replied the young man , and fell back into his glacial and absent-minded silence
0	jean valjean had not uttered a single word
0	and it was you who found it !
0	it seemed to her as though she beheld advancing from all quarters towards her , with the intention of crawling up her body and biting and pinching her , all those hideous implements of torture , which as compared to the instruments of all sorts she had hitherto seen , were like what bats , centipedes , and spiders are among insects and birds
0	when the prisoner 's right arm was free , thenardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him
0	this is a child whom i have reared
0	that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul
0	he added , after a silence , and what shall i do with the sorceress ?
0	the rue rambuteau has devastated all that
0	why is it so solid ?
0	all this was so rapidly executed , that it was all over when those about the wine-shop noticed it
0	no , you are mistaken !
0	she beheld a large troop of armed men , both horse and foot , drawn up on the grève
0	this makes heaps in my room
0	a cobbler opposite called them to him , and delivered to them a paper which their mother had left for them
0	all , with the exception of laigle , were from the south
0	on the numberth of april , number , a passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the rue sainte-marguerite and shouted : i am a babouvist !
0	he had thick eyelashes , enormous black whiskers , prominent eyes , the lower part of his face like a snout ; and besides all this , that air of being on his own ground , which is indescribable
0	jean valjean had , in fact , returned home , and had said to cosette : we set out this evening and we go to the rue de l'homme arme with toussaint
0	the barricade was ten times attacked , approached , assailed , scaled , and never captured
0	i took that from the monkeys
0	kekcaa signifies : quest que c'est que cela a ?
0	a guttural laugh replied from the interior of the wall to these bloody words -- hah !
0	moreover , and we must not forget this , interests which are not very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way
0	the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation
0	m gillenormand 's mobile face was no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature
0	it appears , said gringoire , that this one can also talk ; but tis a rude language , and he is more fortunate than i if he understands itthen , smiting his brow , in a sudden transition of ideas : by the way , what the deuce did they mean this morning with their esmeralda ?
0	she repeated her question
0	then he went away
0	combeferre , surrounded by students and artisans , was speaking of the dead , of jean prouvaire , of bahorel , of mabeuf , and even of cabuc , and of enjolras ' sad severity
0	he heard the sound of a bolt
0	was this another hallucination ?
0	let this serve you as a lesson , you dealer in second-hand secrets , merchant of mysteries , rummager of the shadows , wretch !
0	the prisoner resumed : -do what you please with me
0	in the rue sainte-croix-de-la-bretonnerie , twenty young men , bearded and with long hair , entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later , carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape , and having at their head three men armed , one with a sword , one with a gun , and the third with a pike
0	javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad
0	he had a vague feeling that he should play a ridiculous figure in it
0	all who served b-u-o-naparte were brigands !
0	a fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away
0	it is mingled with the air
0	enjolras , who had just re-loaded his , handed it to him
0	after which , i nail her up
0	pay for the poor people and give them five francs , and do not tell them that it was i
0	the two problems must be combined and made but one
0	expensive drugs are required
0	and m mabeuf fell into a delicious revery
0	can the soul be completely made over by fate , and become evil , fate being evil ?
0	when he beheld him in broad daylight , striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death , he recognized him
0	jean valjean 's inclination led him , as we have seen , to the least frequented spots , to solitary nooks , to forgotten places
0	this incident , this last proof , produced a great effect
0	is not a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays ?
0	the elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants ' hall , and which the nuns called the buttery
0	the beggar turned round ; there was surprise , recognition , a lighting up of the two countenances , and so forth ; then , without paying the slightest heed in the world to the spectators , the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a low tone , holding each other ’ s hands , in the meantime , while the rags of clopin trouillefou , spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais , produced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange
0	the cake was wet ; but they were hungry and thirsty
0	as he was handing it to him , he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp
0	then he heard his soul , which had become terrible once more , give vent to a dull roar in the gloom
0	cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father
0	nothing , replied liénarde , in great confusion ; it is my neighbor , gisquette la gencienne , who wishes to speak with you
0	it is for a woman , but it 's for the people
0	in the winter she did not undress , in order that she might not be so cold
0	on another occasion , continued the poet , with a smile , i peeped through the keyhole , before going to bed , and i beheld the most delicious dame in her shift that ever made a bed creak under her bare foot
0	when i caught sight of your little ones , so pretty , so clean , and so happy , it overwhelmed me
0	to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice
0	we were not made -- here she paused , fixed her dull eyes on marius , and burst out laughing , saying , with an intonation which contained every form of anguish , stifled by every form of cynicism : -bah !
0	this was almost indignantly refused
0	monseigneur , said a soldier , he has disappeared
0	she laid down the book , caught up a pen , and exclaimed : -and i know how to write , too !
0	a hundred years ago , the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence , the pickpocket in danger slipped thither ; the forest had its cave , paris had its sewer
0	with the exception of the patrol , no one had passed through the street since he had been there
0	his bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable
0	and then , cosette , in whom the woman was beginning to dawn , was delighted to be a baroness
0	the man 's head was bent down , and he did not see him approaching
0	the bourgeoisie then , as well as the statesmen , required a man who should express this word halt
0	these clamors attracted the attention of the cardinal
0	nothing was to be heard but this
0	in the meantime , all the beggars , all the lackeys , all the cutpurses , joined with the scholars , had gone in procession to seek , in the cupboard of the law clerks ’ company , the cardboard tiara , and the derisive robe of the pope of the fools
0	do you know what that torture is , which is imposed upon you for long nights by your burning arteries , your bursting heart , your breaking head , your teeth-knawed hands ; mad tormentors which turn you incessantly , as upon a red-hot gridiron , to a thought of love , of jealousy , and of despair !
0	she uttered a cry of joy
0	impressed solely with the child 's gown and the old man 's hair , he had dubbed the daughter mademoiselle lanoire , and the father , monsieur leblanc , so that as no one knew them under any other title , this nickname became a law in the default of any other name
0	cosette always moved as little as possible
0	on the stroke of nine , do you understand , i shall be in the garden
0	what lay below was not water , it was a gulf
0	that set me to thinking
0	to the abbey of ascend-with-regret , [ number ] replied gavroche
0	some of these faubourgs were important : there were , first , starting from la tournelle , the bourg saint-victor , with its one arch bridge over the bièvre , its abbey where one could read the epitaph of louis le gros , _epitaphium ludovici grossi_ , and its church with an octagonal spire , flanked with four little bell towers of the eleventh century ( a similar one can be seen at etampes ; it is not yet destroyed ) ; next , the bourg saint-marceau , which already had three churches and one convent ; then , leaving the mill of the gobelins and its four white walls on the left , there was the faubourg saint-jacques with the beautiful carved cross in its square ; the church of saint-jacques du haut-pas , which was then gothic , pointed , charming ; saint-magloire , a fine nave of the fourteenth century , which napoleon turned into a hayloft ; notre-dame des champs , where there were byzantine mosaics ; lastly , after having left behind , full in the country , the monastery des chartreux , a rich edifice contemporary with the palais de justice , with its little garden divided into compartments , and the haunted ruins of vauvert , the eye fell , to the west , upon the three roman spires of saint-germain des prés
0	the uproar still filled the city
0	toussaint was busy in her kitchen , which opened on the back yard
0	my father , charles the seventh , was accustomed to say that the truth was ailing ; i thought her dead , and that she had found no confessor
0	he took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit , considering it something to hold his own against europe , but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner
0	the one who is singing ?
0	she added , as though with an effort : -the address -- you know very well !
0	he was harsh for a time towards the former , because , holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes , the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape
0	it was the poor goat , the agile djali , which had made its escape after her , at the moment when quasimodo had put to flight charmolue ’ s brigade , and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly an hour past , without being able to win a glance
0	you will not crumble so easily , will you , my good bastille ?
0	hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace , when all of a sudden , and without transition , he made a strange movement , which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror , had they witnessed it
0	let them talk , little one !
0	now , if there are any fathers among you , fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their child 's tiny hand in their robust hand , let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own
0	the death of the poor scholar imparted a furious ardor to that crowd
0	this , as the reader knows , happened from time to time , at very long intervals
0	it is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all , that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries , and that from the moment he presented himself , there existed among them a secret , suppressed rivalry , which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves , but which broke forth , none the less , every instant , in their gestures and remarks
0	but he did not abuse his knowledge
0	he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs , and his handkerchief
0	then he continued : from the tuileries to the luxembourg , there is but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage ; that is not far
0	a full month elapsed , during which marius went every day to the luxembourg
0	i became vagrant and wandering like yourself
0	in this state of revery , an eye which could have cast a glance into marius ' interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul
0	however , he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of father six-fours , the water-carrier , and would have thought no more about it
0	its wall included a large part of that plain where julian had built his hot baths
0	said the soldier , ah !
0	now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers , a fantastic dwarf climbing , writhing , crawling on all fours , descending outside above the abyss , leaping from projection to projection , and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon ; it was quasimodo dislodging the crows
0	as long as i had money , i feasted , i lead a mad and joyous life
0	tis a thing deserving of compassion , i assure you
0	he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of , and he walked on tiptoe
0	we are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons , and the sublimity of prayer
0	the frail glass door gave passage to two persons , and closed noiselessly behind them ; it was a man and a woman
0	the river is the true grave
0	i am not related to cosette
0	and finally , i am at your orders , i and my wits , and my science and my letters , ready to live with you , damsel , as it shall please you , chastely or joyously ; husband and wife , if you see fit ; brother and sister , if you think that better
0	i do not see the accused
0	the thickets of the king ’ s gardens , which covered the western point of the city , masked the island du passeur
0	en capote bleue , la poule au shako , voici la banlieue !
0	take away time is money , what remains of england ?
0	he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one 's self , all of a sudden , face to face , in the dark , with a tiger
0	on the face of this aged queen of our cathedrals , by the side of a wrinkle , one always finds a scar
0	in the meantime , boulatruelle 's manoeuvres in the forest ceased ; and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending ; and people gossiped of something else
0	in proportion as the situation grew gloomy , the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade more and more
0	gentlemen , my father always detested me because i could not understand mathematics
0	the angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew
0	then , by way of dinner , he tried to sleep
0	good heavens , how pretty that little goat was !
0	he must watch it , cheek it , repress it , and obey it only at the last extremity
0	get it well fixed in your noddles , my children , that you are in the true road
0	thanks to the sand , there was not a speck of mud ; thanks to the rain , there was not a grain of ashes
0	while he was discussing this modest dinner , he had , twice or thrice , noticed in a confused way , toussaint 's stammering words as she said to him : monsieur , there is something going on , they are fighting in paris
0	better , is it not ?
0	et je n ’ ai moi , par la sang-dieu ! ni foi , ni loi , ni feu , ni lieu , ni roi , ni dieu
0	i am willing that they should cut my throat , and i am ready to swear that i never said either you , thou , or i , in my life , if i do not know that parisian
0	my knees have been worn for fifteen years in praying to thee , my god !
0	its entrance was guarded by a force of halberdiers with the armorial bearings of the bishop
0	that done , he had a fainting fit
0	the poor mother bowed her head
0	would you wish the king to fall ill again ?
0	he resumed his dainty , caressing air
0	to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism
0	then she felt a pang at her heart
0	there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation ; he was eloquent with that eloquence
0	it certainly was singular that the stoker of order , that the engineer of authority , mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road , could be unseated by a flash of light !
0	whence had issued that fulminating convict , who almost without taking breath , and with the same set of combatants in hand , pulverized , one after the other , the five armies of the emperor of germany , upsetting beaulieu on alvinzi , wurmser on beaulieu , melas on wurmser , mack on melas ?
0	hill , having been weakened , had come up to the support of wellington ; picton was dead
0	not a drop of water !
0	he was entirely nude , of the hue of ashes , and mounted on a horse which was earth color
0	_corne-de-boeuf_ , what a jest !
0	is it possible that irony is derived from it ?
0	any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in number a congregation of bernardines-benedictines , with salamanca for the head of the order , and alcala as the branch establishment
0	thenardier was cunning , greedy , slothful , and clever
0	probity , sincerity , candor , conviction , the sense of duty , are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed ; but which , even when hideous , remain grand : their majesty , the majesty peculiar to the human conscience , clings to them in the midst of horror ; they are virtues which have one vice , -- error
0	[ number ] -- there 's a festive programme , there 's a good one , or else i know nothing of such matters , deuce take it !
0	do not be vexed , marius , give me permission to speak ; i say no evil of the people as you see , i am always harping on your people , but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie
0	i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge , as it is my duty to do
0	he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket , drew out a sort of a pass-key , opened the door , entered , closed it again carefully , and ascended the staircase , still carrying cosette
0	one thing is certain , that la esmeralda had come to france while still very young , by way of hungary
0	moreover , m mabeuf had continued his downward course
0	he recalled his former companions : how wretched they were ; they rose at dawn , and toiled until night ; hardly were they permitted to sleep ; they lay on camp beds , where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick , in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year ; they were clothed in frightful red blouses ; they were allowed , as a great favor , linen trousers in the hottest weather , and a woollen carter 's blouse on their backs when it was very cold ; they drank no wine , and ate no meat , except when they went on fatigue duty
0	a biscuit , in the shady symbolism of prisons , signifies : nothing to be done
0	finally , no longer knowing what to do , and what was to become of me , i denounced you to the official
0	he was on the point of swooning ; he saw marius through a dazzling light
0	this chapel , quite new , having been built only six years , was entirely in that charming taste of delicate architecture , of marvellous sculpture , of fine and deep chasing , which marks with us the end of the gothic era , and which is perpetuated to about the middle of the sixteenth century in the fairylike fancies of the renaissance
0	toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other
0	some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there ; m thibord du chalard , m lemarchant de gomicourt , and the celebrated scoffer of the right , m cornet-dincourt
0	this is what marius read in it : -madame la comtesse : it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old
0	marius heard his heart beating in his temples , he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears , his bleeding father , vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him , and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him
0	it had rained on the preceding night ; the soil was soaked
0	thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase : the fortunate and the unfortunate
0	in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation , there was acceptance of peril
0	the ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows , but the vessel has its soul , its compass , which counsels it and always shows it the north
0	marius lived in a state of delight
0	you must inspire confidence !
0	are you not intending to take her away from us ?
0	he said of the crucifix : there is a gibbet which has been a success
0	they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat
0	we do not know that which it is necessary to know , and we know that which we should ignore
0	it was at the moment when he was returning , on quasimodo day , from saying his mass at the altar of the lazy , which was by the side of the door leading to the nave on the right , near the image of the virgin , that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for foundlings
0	it is true , nevertheless , that grave-diggers do die themselves
0	i am your friend
0	you want me to swear ?
0	i am called lesgueules , by contraction lesgle , and by corruption l'aigle
0	in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked
0	there was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys , and whose name was sister agatha
0	she had a confused consciousness of something horrible
0	he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood !
0	one of them said to us one day , the sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot
0	what have they given us in return for all this gallic history , for all this gothic art ?
0	the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime ; they called jean valjean the other fauvent
0	it has already been put into verse
0	will you deny , said coictier , the sympathetic force of the collar bone , and the cabalistics which are derived from it ?
0	the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable , tortuous , colossal citadel
0	for a space of fifteen years , those great principles which are so old for the thinker , so new for the statesman , could be seen at work in perfect peace , on the public square ; equality before the law , liberty of conscience , liberty of speech , liberty of the press , the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions
0	they were heard to say : thanks for royalism !
0	the big big girls -- those over ten years of age -- called her agathocles
0	to no there is only one reply , yes
0	jean valjean had labored over cosette
0	did you notice how i played that game on him , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of february ?
0	the beautiful candle is extinguished and i have henceforth , only a wretched tallow dip which smokes in my nose
0	the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat , a gesture characteristic of the vulture , and replied with an augmented smile
0	and you kept a pot-house at montfermeil
0	they touched each other , they gazed at each other , they clasped each other 's hands , they pressed close to each other ; but there was a distance which they did not pass
0	he got as far as the rue pavee , shook his head and turned back ; then he went no further than the rue des trois-pavillons ; then he did not overstep the blancs-manteaux
0	that is suspicious , said the provost
0	all night long i have seen white things , and persons who smiled at me
0	the landlord once gone , he threw himself into an arm-chair and remained for some time buried in thought
0	one might almost say that he had assumed its form , as the snail takes on the form of its shell
0	the gardener , spade on back , replied in the most unconcerned tone : -it is the riots
0	still the white-haired man and the girl advanced
0	to you , louis de beaumont , bishop of paris , counsellor in the court of parliament , i , clopin trouillefou , king of thunes , grand coësre , prince of argot , bishop of fools , i say : our sister , falsely condemned for magic , hath taken refuge in your church , you owe her asylum and safety
0	the abyss was there below him
0	cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her ; she turned round
0	in her early childhood she must even have been pretty
0	thus he proceeded in the gloom
0	as he remained silent , she exclaimed : -say -- then she paused
0	who was this jean valjean ?
0	brushing one 's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one 's soul
0	the emperor had been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires , for whom one sacrifices one 's self ; he was something more to marius
0	it was very fine
0	who killed that man ?
0	he was full of resources
0	happily , if he saw the lantern well , the lantern saw him but ill
0	the thicket , bristling as it was , struck him as the best road
0	javert followed jean valjean
0	the memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart ; the more it has disappeared , the more it beams ; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon ; the star of the inner night
0	jean valjean turned pale
0	this is the whole truth , and i do not think that i have omitted anything
0	that 's what the republicans are like
0	one of these personages , fantastically accoutred in many an oriental rag , was mathias hungadi spicali , duke of egypt and bohemia
0	their veil is of woven night
0	marius , thoughtfully , and with his eyes diked on the ceiling , repeated almost mechanically : my mother ? -- at that moment , he felt enjolras ' hand on his shoulder
0	braid them , twist them together ; the result is enormous : it is attila hesitating between marcian on the east and valentinian on the west ; it is hannibal tarrying at capua ; it is danton falling asleep at arcis-sur-aube
0	there is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers
0	make men , make men
0	admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed of a wrath and of an enigma , one divined in the first barricade the dragon , and behind the second the sphinx
0	in the second year of his work , bruneseau engaged the assistance of his son-in-law nargaud
0	manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself , buried but still alive
0	perhaps he was above compensation , but no one is above gratitude
0	all at once , cosette paused ; she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers ' doll , which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table
0	men , women , children , hurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses , and hung there like cats , with teeth , finger nails and toe nails
0	from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon , m l'abbe mabeuf
0	he was astounded , uncertain , incredulous , convinced , dazzled
0	gavroche looked on and listened , making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears
0	there are queer spots on those great men
0	they were waiting with a quiver for the great blow which should split it open
0	at that epoch , the northern extremity of the rue saint-louis was in process of repaving
0	he had probably been through the campaign of number , and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor , it would seem
0	all at once , without himself knowing what was in him , and what impulse he was obeying , he sprang to his feet , stretched both arms out of the window , gazed intently into the gloom , the silence , the infinite darkness , the eternal immensity , and exclaimed : long live the emperor !
0	but have you reached the point , great savant as you are , of no longer believing in science ?
0	the work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome
0	what do you want with me ?
0	't is the fault of rousseau
0	they are put there so that they will decay the sooner !
0	stay , monsieur the archdeacon , no ill-feeling between old friends !
0	he would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance , had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron
0	he really had had a brother named ultime , who was dead
0	he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden
0	dante in folio nous servait de table pour manger gaiment un cent de marrons
0	he seemed to see nothing around him
0	i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers
0	for this purpose , i am greatly in need of a little money , and i come to you , brother , with my heart full of contrition
0	said he , with the innocent air of thinking of it for the first time , guillaume de harancourt , the friend of monsieur the cardinal balue
0	he said , that takes nothing from the poor
0	and how did you return ?
0	such wastes of riches do occur
0	the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna ; the tolbiac of clovis and the austerlitz of napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water
0	and to think that there is not a hussy in paris who would not have been delighted to make this wretch happy !
0	while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire , with his back turned , the worthy host , jacquin labarre , drew a pencil from his pocket , then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window
0	they tore him from his hiding-place , and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them , by administering blows with the flats of their swords
0	manuel etait fier et sage , paris s'asseyait a de saints banquets , foy lancait la foudre , et votre corsage avait une epingle ou je me piquais
0	towards one o'clock in the morning , the night being very dark , he saw two shadows pass along the roof , in the rain and squalls , in front of the dormer-window which was opposite his cage
0	this happened , i think , towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity
0	he told himself that it was plain , that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever , and that cosette had written that to some one
0	the second article , which enters a little more into detail , is an extract from the journal de paris , of the same date
0	moreover , he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris ; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the cafe lemblin , and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire , that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the ermitage , on the boulevard du maine , spatchcocked chickens at mother sauget 's , excellent matelotes at the barriere de la cunette , and a certain thin white wine at the barriere du com pat
0	some day we shall be amazed
0	exist boldly for each other , make us burst with rage that we can not do the same , idealize each other , catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth , and arrange yourselves a nest for life
0	the husband made a jealous scene
0	m gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the rue de babylone
0	but without attaining to such happiness , mother crucifixion 's death was very precious
0	then he went out
0	here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances
0	but the little brother , like those young trees which deceive the gardener ’ s hopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and air , the little brother did not grow and did not multiply , but only put forth fine bushy and luxuriant branches on the side of laziness , ignorance , and debauchery
0	but , as the newcomer did not utter a word , he knew not what to think
0	his foot once within the asylum , the criminal was sacred ; but he must beware of leaving it ; one step outside the sanctuary , and he fell back into the flood
0	and turning to his guest : the night wind is harsh on the alps
0	it was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which held an axe in its hand ; this corpse was sub-lieutenant legros
0	we need only lower the curtains
0	if one doubled this cape , one arrived a few paces further on , in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened
0	what is the matter ?
0	_un cofre de gran riqueza hallaron dentro un pilar , dentro del , nuevas banderascon figuras de espantar_
0	murmured gringoire , the king here must be a ram
0	paris drinks a million litres of water a day , but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin
0	does monsieur le maire wish to purchase them or me ?
0	our marriage was a real _forismaritagium_
0	at that moment , he had three francs left
0	to be prince equality , to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution , to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power , therein lay the fortune of louis philippe in number ; never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event ; the one entered into the other , and the incarnation took place
0	great perils have this fine characteristic , that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers
0	again he paused ; marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder
0	if you were to see me die , you would laugh
0	he recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin , as though he wished the man to understand , without advising him directly and harshly , that this would afford him a refuge
0	the sorbonne was the bucolic spot where i adored thee from eve till morn
0	the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen , the police agent against the mayor , the man who is down against the man who is up in the world , is what i call false kindness
0	this mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had made him shy
0	said tristan to the soldier , you have the nose of an inquisitor of the châtelet
0	they have yielded a great deal of juice under the press
0	it seems as though , at the approach of a certain dark hour , the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth
0	dear child , there are so many people who are better than i and who have not even a roof over their heads
0	what is a fontis ?
0	and next year , if god and our lady ( here he raised his hat ) lend us life , we shall drink our potions from a pewter pot !
0	certain well-known leaders were going the rounds , that is to say , running from one house to another , to collect their men
0	if i were on the square with my dog , my knife , and my wife , and if you were to squander ten sous on me , i would not refuse to work , but this is not shrove tuesday
0	the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly , stared intently at jean valjean , then dropped his head quickly
0	do you hear , usher ?
0	he is getting decidedly wild , said his grandfather
0	the lantern oscillated violently , and went out
0	but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m madeleine
0	after the departure of the ruffians , the rue plumet resumed its tranquil , nocturnal aspect
0	and he continued to advance
0	nevertheless , there were people of the cabaret les vantes , who said that they had seen her pass along the road to paris , walking on the pebbles with her bare feet
0	he continued : -i said to myself , the moon is bright : it is going to freeze
0	this gentleman of property was very shy , -- never coming out except in the evening , speaking to no one , except , occasionally to the poor , and never allowing any one to approach him
0	roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women , that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible
0	and moreover , when both are sincere and good , no men so penetrate each other , and so amalgamate with each other , as an old priest and an old soldier
0	a convict and a woman of the town
0	it is not surprising that you did not see him
0	the ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity ; the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion
0	for the first time in eight years , the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action
0	consider that i knew the sergeants very well
0	the husband was both master and mistress
0	however , though this was so , she did not account for it to herself
0	he paused and waited
0	at length some strength returned to him ; it occurred to him to take refuge in his tower beside his faithful quasimodo
0	the passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it , without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths
0	he replied : i wanted to know
0	his memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly , losing their proper forms , becoming disproportionately large , then suddenly disappearing , as in a muddy and perturbed pool
0	you shall have your little girl
0	the beggar had the same figure , the same rags , the same appearance as he had every day
0	in the second place , and no offence to combeferre , a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization
0	this sound proceeded from the garden
0	i call to witness the myrtle , the symbol of love , the laurel , the symbol of air , the olive , that ninny , the symbol of peace , the apple-tree which came nearest rangling adam with its pips , and the fig-tree , the grandfather of petticoats
0	i am not a man whose name nobody knows , and who comes and abducts children from houses !
0	in any case , and in spite of whatever may be said , the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
0	about an hour later , jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard , and with his arms
0	andry the red laughed in an idiotic way : notre-dame is making work for the hospital , said he
0	allot to the bailiff of the palace twenty sous , tournois , for three coaches of mascarades in the cross-roads
0	thenardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory , and who has just regained , in one instant , all the ground which he has lost
0	she had a small property , which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community
0	when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the numberth of the line , pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard
0	do not congratulate me too much , sir
0	raised his voice once more , --
0	the restoration had placed him on half-pay , then had sent him into residence , that is to say , under surveillance , at vernon
0	this oddity had attracted customers to his shop , and brought him young men , who said to each other : come hear father hucheloup growl
0	it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows
0	he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people , over what we now call the idea of the nationality , had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case
0	two strongholds of slavery ; but in the first , deliverance possible , a legal limit always in sight , and then , escape
0	there they smoked and drank , and gambled and laughed
0	the shot sped , traversed the hand and possibly , also , the workman , since he fell , but the ball did not strike marius
0	she inherited them from her husband
0	saint didorus , archbishop of cappadocia , desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb : acarus , which signifies , a worm of the earth ; this was done
0	about eighteen months or two years after the events which terminate this story , when search was made in that cavern for the body of olivier le daim , who had been hanged two days previously , and to whom charles viii
0	he is following on my heels , said she
0	claude gaux had stolen a loaf ; jean valjean had stolen a loaf
0	there were six of them to share it
0	two wheels can not be put together hap-hazard
0	there are none , replied wellington ; he must let himself be killed !
0	jean valjean suspected nothing
0	and cosette , nestling close to marius , caressed his ear with an angelic whisper : so it is true
0	we will share thy fate , cried combeferre
0	the gods may not have taken their departure
0	on the way , he rendered justice to providence
0	now hypochondria is taking possession of me again
0	after that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings
0	the noise yonder is redoubling !
0	while jean valjean was putting on his coat , fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap , which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall
0	it was but too true
0	fauchelevent opened the door
0	two battalions , with draped drums and reversed arms , ten thousand national guards , with their swords at their sides , escorted the coffin
0	grumbled coppenole , i am tired of standing ; is there no chair here ?
0	he no longer boxed the maids ' ears ; he no longer thumped the landing-place so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in opening the door
0	madame my mother , said fleur-de-lys gently , that gate is now called the porte d ’ enfer
0	the lantern of the labyrinth of the jardin des plantes is also very ingenious
0	as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table , there came a knock at the door
0	marius had not even seen him
0	we have not always been as we are now
0	he fell to thinking
0	he did not love his grandfather much , as the latter 's gayety and cynicism repelled him , and his feelings towards his father were gloomy
0	it did not concern him further
0	jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures
0	you will then have only a pair of trousers , a waistcoat , a hat and a coat
0	no illegitimacy , no compromise , no grant from the king to the people
0	finally , the fourth compartment , which stretched itself out in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank , and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure , and the banks of the river down stream , was a fresh cluster of palaces and hôtels pressed close about the base of the louvre
0	that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation
0	the wheels hold you fast , the glance has ensnared you
0	if you approach , i will bark
0	he had not noticed , that at the moment when he was closing the doors , the archdeacon had passed close to him and betrayed some displeasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous iron locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall
0	they have a guide , necessity ; and for all forms of satisfaction , appetite
0	upon my word , said he , in his tone of intrepid fatuity , here is a charming creature !
0	but marius ' convalescence had caused the habit to become established , and the arm-chairs of the rue des filles-du-calvaire , better adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the rue de l'homme arme , had rooted it
0	no perpendicular fall is necessary , in front any more than in the rear
0	[ number ] the wretch , whenever he has time to think , makes himself small before the low , and frail in the presence of society ; he lies down flat on his face , he entreats , he appeals to the side of compassion ; we feel that he is conscious of his guilt
0	it was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of sheet iron , with a hood , which rose above a neighboring roof
0	touching illusion of a mother !
0	the archdeacon , on perceiving these wan spots all around the choir , thought he beheld the mitres of damned bishops
0	in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty , when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal , bewildered , furious , exasperated at having to yield , disputing the ground , hoping for a possible flight , seeking an escape , what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear !
0	go to the devil !
0	she belongs not to the king !
0	two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers
0	at length gervaise , the most curious of the three , and consequently the least sensitive , tried to make the recluse speak :
0	exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag , he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps , who were holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived , and who were allowing the insurrection to fry in its own fat , to use the celebrated expression of one of them
0	the first street on the left
0	fleur-de-lys ran up and trembled
0	she pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor ; he entered
0	she is well , works as you would wish , and loves me
0	what , then , is progress ?
0	he examined this revelation , athwart the exaggerations of revery , with an apparent and terrifying calmness , for it is a fearful thing when a man 's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue
0	you can take the place of mistigri in the pack of cards of monseigneur the king
0	you lived in the rue de l'ouest , on the third floor , in the front apartments of a new house , -- you see that i know !
0	what the devil does he want of that old one-eyed fellow ?
0	he was timid even to rudeness
0	the most heart-breaking thing of all was , that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely
0	when the mine is charged , when the conflagration is ready , nothing is more simple
0	the vessel , trembling under the hurricane , is wholly absorbed in its own workings ; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man ; his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves
0	it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple
0	we will go to see the savages
0	she lay down again , with the nun 's assistance , helped the nun to arrange her pillow , and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck , and which sister simplice had given her
0	two of these women were dressed like good _bourgeoises_ of paris
0	the obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation of level
0	the thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window , and it was she who had just given vent to this roar
0	then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister
0	there he walked at a slow pace , with his head strained forward , seeing nothing , hearing nothing , his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him , which never varied , and which was no other than the corner of the rue des filles-du-calvaire
0	however , through his daughter azelma , who had started on the scent of the married pair on the numberth of february , and through his own personal researches , he had succeeded in learning many things , and , from the depths of his own gloom , he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew
0	men and deeds were brought to judgment there
0	( i have pronounced i'ave and fifth pronounced fift ' )
0	there flows a terrible stream , in which bloody hands have been washed
0	jean valjean stepped up to the mirror
0	she stammered in her peasant dialect of barneville : i am made so ; i do my work ; the rest is no affair of mine
0	the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line
0	one fact is to be noticed , that before reaching the exit grating , this convict , who had come a long distance in the sewer , must , necessarily , have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body , but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day , while at work on the quagmire , and that did not suit the assassin 's plans
0	however things might stand , -- and it was to this point that he reverted constantly , -- one fact dominated everything else for him , and that was , that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law
0	all of a sudden , he could see nothing
0	at night he swam off again , and reached the shore a little way from cape brun
0	i shall watch over your departure , you ruffian , and at that moment i will count out to you twenty thousand francs
0	he had been waiting for fantine to awake
0	teeth and claws fear what they can not grasp
0	when gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballets , babet took thenardier aside
0	if any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery , there was but one way for him to get out -- his grave-digger 's card furnished by the department of public funerals
0	the incomprehensible had just made its entrance into fauchelevent 's hut
0	she moved the chairs about , she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode , she handled marius ' clothes , she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners
0	she is hungry , said gringoire , charmed to enter into conversation
0	pray walk a little , that i may see you at full height , and that i may hear your spurs jingle
0	well , you can do to-day for me that which i did for you in the olden days
0	at the same time , the usher handed him the paper
0	guillaume rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene , --
0	gavroche must have delivered my letter to him
0	now , these parents groan , these old folks implore us , these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons ; they desire our return , and offer to kill calves for usbeing virtuous , we obey them
0	the hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity
0	here are the names of the principal ones
0	one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent , and one is accustomed to turn one 's back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding nosegay in its buttonhole
0	a shot had just broken his collar bone , he felt that he was fainting and falling
0	to guide the plough , to bind the sheaves , is joy
0	some one passed close to him at a run
0	cosette , so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house , was now thin and pale
0	i give you simon radin ’ s charge
0	marius , still separated from his betrothed according to usage , did not come until the second
0	i am very glad to see you
0	let us take as an example the middle ages , where we see more clearly because it is nearer to us
0	the monotonous chanting of the celebrants , the responses of the people to the priest , sometimes inarticulate , sometimes thunderous , the harmonious trembling of the painted windows , the organ , bursting forth like a hundred trumpets , the three belfries , humming like hives of huge bees , that whole orchestra on which bounded a gigantic scale , ascending , descending incessantly from the voice of a throng to that of one bell , dulled her memory , her imagination , her grief
0	he gazed with terror on this beauty , which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him , beneath his very eyes , on the innocent and formidable brow of that child , from the depths of her homeliness , of his old age , of his misery , of his reprobation
0	only he grew colder and colder ; laconic at meals , and rare in the house
0	a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips , as though on a piano where some notes are missing
0	it was the terror and dazzled amazement of the men of the sanctuary , in the presence of the luminous press of gutenberg
0	and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view , why do we speak of civil war ?
0	and turning to bigrenaille : -untie the gentleman 's right arm
0	like yourself , reverend mother
0	i was looking for you , resumed laigle de meaux
0	that it was so much the worse for the government
0	i shall stay here
0	the children dead , the income was at an end
0	find it for me
0	now , i just ask you , hernani !
0	the republicans are beasts with feathers
0	a week passed , and jean valjean had not taken a step in his room
0	is there not , dear madame , something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon , from moralizing , from allusions ?
0	theology conquered , he had plunged into decretals
0	he broke off : tavern-keeper of the devil , give me some supper !
0	from a bird ’ s-eye view , these three burgs , the city , the town , and the university , each presented to the eye an inextricable skein of eccentrically tangled streets
0	it breaks my teeth !
0	't is the fault of rousseau
0	six hundred thousand francs ?
0	monsieur , said mother plutarque sadly , it is the water-carrier
0	an architect of good taste amputated it ( number ) , and considered it sufficient to mask the wound with that large , leaden plaster , which resembles a pot cover
0	who are we ourselves ?
0	columns were thrown into the streets where there was fermentation , sweeping the large , sounding the small , right and left , now slowly and cautiously , now at full charge
0	he set to work to eat up the money for these copies
0	a notary 's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs , which was all that he possessed in his brother 's right and his own
0	what do you expect me to do ?
0	i have prepared everything
0	do you want german ?
0	so much for you , you peasants !
0	the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor , then the prioress turned round and said : -father fauvent , you will get another knee-cap with a bell
0	i will teach you the secret virtues of the greek word , _peristera_
0	let us say here that a prince ’ s apartment was then composed of never less than eleven large rooms , from the chamber of state to the oratory , not to mention the galleries , baths , vapor-baths , and other superfluous places , with which each apartment was provided ; not to mention the private gardens for each of the king ’ s guests ; not to mention the kitchens , the cellars , the domestic offices , the general refectories of the house , the poultry-yards , where there were twenty-two general laboratories , from the bakehouses to the wine-cellars ; games of a thousand sorts , malls , tennis , and riding at the ring ; aviaries , fishponds , menageries , stables , barns , libraries , arsenals and foundries
0	what was to be done ?
0	but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question
0	alas , vanity and cowardice everywhere
0	it was a bloody smile
0	are you in search of marie la giffarde ?
0	for the first time in fifteen months , he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter , had , on his side , noticed him , and probably considered his assiduity singular
0	from time to time , a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of vehicles ; one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot was disentangled ; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line
0	he had what was called under the old regime , the double hand , that is to say , an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier , or a squadron or a battalion as an officer
0	her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim
0	these were questions which divided the crowd , and seemed to divide the jury ; there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case : the drama was not only melancholy ; it was also obscure
0	the aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has not waterloo as its source
0	they were no longer giants matched with colossi
0	i am very weary ; twelve leagues on foot ; i am very hungry
0	for instance , i have always been witty ; when i was a pupil of gros , instead of daubing wretched little pictures , i passed my time in pilfering apples ; rapin [ number ] is the masculine of rapine
0	did javert penetrate it ?
0	every one knoweth that great wealth is not to be drawn from literature , and that those who are best posted in good books do not always have a great fire in winter
0	on the white margin he wrote a line or two , folded it without sealing , and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey
0	marius sprang to his feet
0	it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime
0	it was a veteran , very much bent , extremely wrinkled , and pale , in a uniform of the louis xv
0	mother thenardier released her daughters , made them descend from the swing , and said : -now amuse yourselves , all three of you
0	yes , an ineffable something which wounded fleur-de-lys
0	replied the lad , as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him
0	the density , which was his support , was also an obstacle
0	he had dined on a bone , on which a little meat lingered , and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table , and had seated himself on an overturned stone post , which took the place of a bench in his garden
0	i am entirely devoted to the convent
0	all at once favourite made a movement , like a person who is just waking up
0	they were livid with the chill of morning
0	this was the most lively , and consequently the most hideous , point of the whole outcast den
0	but he had found cosette sad ; cosette had been weeping
0	the word alchemists suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of archdeacon claude frollo
0	perhaps he really saw hell beyond it
0	he did not finish
0	but what is there , then , above the sun ?
0	he often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden , the beds of lettuce , the chickens on the dung-heap , the horse turning the water-wheel
0	and so thou still thinkest of me !
0	you are procurator to the king in the ecclesiastical courts : this parchment is abominable
0	he paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments
0	returned the recluse , you must have been born
0	you are the only one , resumed gringoire , who has listened to the piece decorously
0	yes ; and go to the devil , but cure me
0	when the vault is open -- i will close it again
0	i do not know , said lombier
0	we have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of notre-dame ; another , because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the invalides had been temporarily deposited , and had prigged some lead from them ; a third , because he had seen a diligence tip over ; still another , because he knew a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen
0	then he seeks for the appropriate word as one seeks for a sword
0	the tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most ancient days of the monarchy
0	a little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer , and to see that the man was carrying something on his back
0	thenardier 's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap
0	one morning , on awaking , she saw on her window two vases filled with flowers
0	that will be enough
0	at the same time , as though an invisible hand had lifted the weight which had repressed her tears in her heart for so long , she began to weep , and , in proportion as her tears flowed , she felt all that was most acrid and bitter in her grief depart with them
0	the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march
0	in less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten , and he was nothing but a convict from the galleys
0	as he withdrew his leg , he asked his daughter : -is it cold ?
0	they demanded light with the mask of night
0	go now , soul , trembling in the balance , and god have mercy upon thee
0	he was councillor to the king in the matter of the courts of the treasury
0	the little ones skipped about ; the elder ones danced
0	the gamin of paris is rabelais in this youth
0	she said to him in her turn : what is the matter ?
0	she refused the cloak as she had refused the flagon and the cake , and replied , a sack
0	the faubourg saint-germain reeks of the fagot even now
0	_advorsum stimulos , laminas , crucesque , compedesque , nerros , catenas , carceres , numellas , pedicas , boias_
0	clopin made a sign
0	a man in black and a handsome officer
0	however , the hearing has been suspended
0	then he turned towards the bed , and , still seated , for he could not stand , he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects
0	i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you
0	jean valjean advanced with precaution , taking care not to knock against the furniture
0	how , being in possession of the false object of life , happiness , one forgets the true object , duty !
0	he could honor colonel pontmercy 's recommendation
0	who , my fair cousin , is this big gendarme , who is puffing out his cheeks to their full extent and blowing a trumpet ?
0	it was one of those looks to which one does not reply
0	his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret
0	she said , bursting into a laugh , how you do shake me !
0	the church was again deserted , and had fallen back into its silence
0	that monster of a mayor , that old blackguard of a mayor , is the cause of all
0	a theatre poster presented itself , adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic : down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois !
0	the lower town , in which he lived , had but one school , a miserable hovel , which was falling to ruin : he constructed two , one for girls , the other for boys
0	the fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse , torn trousers of coarse velvet , bare feet , and something which resembled a pool of blood
0	there were six and twenty squadrons of them ; and they had behind them to support them lefebvre-desnouettes 's division , -- the one hundred and six picked gendarmes , the light cavalry of the guard , eleven hundred and ninety-seven men , and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and eighty lances
0	if it is eight o'clock , at eight o'clock and at all hours !
0	it was the house which nicolas flamel had built , where he had died about number , and which , constantly deserted since that time , had already begun to fall in ruins , -- so greatly had the hermetics and the alchemists of all countries wasted away the walls , merely by carving their names upon them
0	do not say that even in jest ! if you were to cease to love me , i would spring after you , i would scratch you , i should rend you , i would throw you into the water , i would have you arrested
0	some days later , one morning , when the sun was shining brightly , and they were both on the steps leading to the garden , another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself , and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt , cosette , in a wrapper , was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star ; and , with her head bathed in light , rosy after a good sleep , submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man , she was picking a daisy to pieces
0	i have travelled twelve leagues
0	i don ’ t even know your name
0	comrade , this is your last resource
0	look at him , the pig ! -- come !
0	he has no shirt on his body , no shoes on his feet , no roof over his head ; he is like the flies of heaven , who have none of these things
0	but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend , and when father gillenormand entered the attic , marius was no longer there
0	i shall have enough left to reach the country , by travelling on foot
0	courfeyrac and bossuet , whose brave good humor increased with the peril , like madame scarron , replaced nourishment with pleasantry , and , as wine was lacking , they poured out gayety to all
0	it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man ; he had his big arm-chair carried to marius ' bedside ; he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages
0	nevertheless , it remains a riot
0	finally , the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd , who served the member of the convention in his hovel , had come in quest of a doctor ; that the old wretch was dying , that paralysis was gaining on him , and that he would not live over night -- thank god !
0	come , said he , you must have a little pity
0	now , in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table , we can not do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle baptistine 's letters to madame boischevron , wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minuteness
0	he walked in an enigma
0	then you are not going to demand any money of me ?
0	great strategists have their eclipses
0	that capital of forces which human thought had been expending in edifices , it henceforth expends in books
0	i have done nothing to you
0	is your romance consumptive ?
0	twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july , the year number had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening
0	the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle , which was wide open ; the breezes of february are not warm ; as the fishwife , clad in a low-necked gown , replied to the spaniard , she shivered , laughed and coughed
0	one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous , which i earned in the galleys by my labor , in the course of nineteen years
0	of all pitched battles , waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants
0	this respite , which was thus prolonged , was a sign that the government was taking its time , and collecting its forces
0	a useful and graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls
0	where is he living now ?
0	the spire of saint-sulpice , and the three lofty needles of saint germain-des-prés , rose above the horizon on his right
0	he wasted a tolerably large allowance , something like three thousand francs a year , in doing nothing
0	children disappeared in paris ; the police carried them off , for what mysterious purpose no one knew
0	jean valjean , bewildered , let her have her own way
0	he was the marble lover of liberty
0	three pieces of a hundred sous , said fauchelevent
0	let us not apply a flame where only a light is required
0	this man was at the barricade , said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself
0	then she added with a pitiless expression , well aware that she was about to pierce the priest ’ s heart with thousands of red-hot irons , --
0	i have said that i would put earth in it
0	he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk , which was very near , then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl
0	cosette had slept only a few hours , but soundly
0	chapter v the two men clothed in black
0	my piece of money !
0	he made some remarks about a door which shut badly , and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman ; then he entered fantine 's chamber , approached the bed and drew aside the curtains
0	who is there who is not fifty years old ?
0	extreme as was the crisis , inevitable as was the catastrophe , there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man , who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water
0	he took advantage of their fright , and while they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had fallen from heaven , and while they were putting out the eyes of the stone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and buckshot , quasimodo was silently piling up plaster , stones , and rough blocks of stone , even the sacks of tools belonging to the masons , on the edge of the balustrade from which the beam had already been hurled
0	he extended his hands
0	at that word which jean valjean had just uttered once more , all that was swelling marius ' heart found vent
0	it resembled the faint , vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures
0	outside the pale of that holy thing , justice , by what right does one form of man despise another ?
0	do you know , my dear , that parliament hath full jurisdiction over all places of asylum , and that you were running a great risk in your little chamber at notre-dame ?
0	no one was ever able to discover how , and by what connivance , he succeeded in procuring , and secreting a bottle of wine , invented , so it is said , by desrues , with which a narcotic is mixed , and which the band of the endormeurs , or sleep-compellers , rendered famous
0	marius , said m gillenormand , you will set out for vernon to-morrow
0	just let me see you , you good-for-nothing !
0	she was dressed in white and had a white veil on her head
0	chopin quitted the dram-shop
0	after the lapse of a few minutes , he was no longer blind
0	it was there that bauduin was killed
0	_cornutus et hirsutus_ , horned and hairy , another went on
0	in the same way that one says of corneille : where did he find the means of dying ?
0	all armed protests , even the most legitimate , even that of the numberth of august , even that of july numberth , begin with the same troubles
0	history neglects nearly all these particulars , and can not do otherwise ; the infinity would overwhelm itnevertheless , these details , which are wrongly called trivial , -- there are no trivial facts in humanity , nor little leaves in vegetation , -- are useful
0	he did not even start , but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark : it is perfectly simple
0	as the reader perceives , the pillory of the grève was far from presenting all the recreations of the pillory of the halles
0	the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this
0	give me twenty francs
0	that was the number which i counted , said the bishop
0	on the crest of the highest gallery , higher than the central rose window , there was a great flame rising between the two towers with whirlwinds of sparks , a vast , disordered , and furious flame , a tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind , from time to time
0	their nerves have turned to bone ; their bones have turned to stone
0	that is different ; but go to the inn all the same , and get an extra horse ; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads
0	before the right gets set free , there is foam and tumult
0	he is better dressed , that is all !
0	until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded , war , that at least which is the effort of the future , which is hastening on against the past , which is lagging in the rear , may be necessary
0	the earth was thus better lighted than the sky , which produces a particularly sinister effect , and the hill , whose contour was poor and mean , was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
0	he had done nothing if he did not do all this ; his whole life was useless ; all his penitence was wasted
0	the man was montparnasse
0	this man , we will state at once , was a former member of the convention
0	the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance
0	a good woman pointed out your house to me , and said to me , knock there !
0	ever since you were wounded , she has passed her time in weeping and making lint
0	dampness was invading it , the flowers were deserting it
0	the good man entered
0	it now seemed probable that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person
0	the orgy grew more and more flemish
0	all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices
0	we do not need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the tour de l'horologe , to find out the number of degrees of cold ; we feel our blood congealing in our veins , and the ice forming round our hearts , and we say : there is no god !
0	the lofty house which formed the back of the barricade , being turned to the east , had upon its roof a rosy reflection
0	at that age , and on that boulevard , eight o'clock in the evening was the dead of the night
0	yes , he said to himself , perchance she is sleeping , or praying
0	he did not go as far as the brahmin , but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes : who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth ?
0	in that case , retorted favourite , death to blachevelle , and long live tholomyes !
0	and then , when all was said , although the president was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man , he was , at the same time , a devoted and almost an ardent royalist , and he had been shocked to hear the mayor of m sur m say the emperor , and not bonaparte , when alluding to the landing at cannes
0	we still cherish a hope that they will not dare
0	he almost trembled lest she should want him
0	at least , that is the way in which monsieur the cure of saint-remy explains why these women are colder and hungrier than other poor women , when they are old
0	that 's no matter , as i ca not see your face and as i do not know your name , you are wrong in supposing that i do not know who you are and what you want
0	jehan did not allow him to finish
0	you can not go to see them without sinking into the earth
0	as we have seen , prayer , the celebration of the offices of religion , alms-giving , the consolation of the afflicted , the cultivation of a bit of land , fraternity , frugality , hospitality , renunciation , confidence , study , work , filled every day of his life
0	that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree !
0	how do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand ?
0	ou vont les belles filles , lon la
0	from scruples , the mother proceeded to uneasiness : but what if the police were to annoy us ?
0	jean valjean 's purse was of no use to m mabeuf
0	these sudden congealments in the state of revery , which a single word suffices to evoke , do occur
0	the doctor dismissed her
0	the sewers of rome , says liebig , have absorbed all the well-being of the roman peasant
0	the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators
0	there was in tholomyes a district attorney , and in courfeyrac a paladin
0	all we shall then have to do , will be to thrash you soundly for the space of a week
0	for them , the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness
0	would you like to have her pay you in the face ?
0	then the poor man fell to sobbing
0	he had kept all the pain to himself
0	marius stepped up to the doctor
0	ask of me anything you wish !
0	no one was present excepting the nun and the mayor
0	his coat was of the best cut , but threadbare
0	the latter , of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorbeau house , was a very cunning and very adroit young spark , with a bewildered and plaintive air
0	lacenaire made this response , enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned , but clear to the police : perhaps it was patron-minette
0	marius was seized with a shudder
0	in vain did he struggle , he was reduced to confess , in his inmost heart , the sublimity of that wretch
0	his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him i-deny-god ( je-nie dieu , chenildieu )
0	monsieur , said jean valjean , i should like to say a word to you in private
0	curled , pomaded , with laced waist , the hips of a woman , the bust of a prussian officer , the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him , his cravat knowingly tied , a bludgeon in his pocket , a flower in his buttonhole ; such was this dandy of the sepulchre
0	a cloud swept across marius ' brow
0	and they will look at your hands
0	the adventure smacked of enchantment
0	in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman , and in that garden , a passable apple-tree
0	no more than yourself !
0	after some hesitation , he decided to apply to this man , not without having first glanced behind and in front of him , as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put
0	it was three days since she had seen marius
0	while , if he accomplished his sacrifice , a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys , the post , the iron necklet , the green cap , unceasing toil , and pitiless shame
0	there was no piece of furniture adapted to sleeping purposes , except a tolerably long wooden coffer ; and its cover was carved , to boot ; which afforded gringoire , when he stretched himself out upon it , a sensation somewhat similar to that which micromégas would feel if he were to lie down on the alps
0	that is very lucky , said the old man , in a reproachful tone
0	the archdeacon had just seated himself , by the light of a three-jetted copper lamp , before a vast coffer crammed with manuscripts
0	i will lie in wait for him better another time , he said , dropping his head
0	i had had an idea for a long time ; a resemblance ; inquiries which you had caused to be made at faverolles ; the strength of your loins ; the adventure with old fauchelevant ; your skill in marksmanship ; your leg , which you drag a little ; -- i hardly know what all , -- absurdities !
0	nothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle , senile palsy , offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught
0	the two young girls dropped their eyes
0	the shades , those sombre hatchers of primitive christianity , only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light
0	i ’ m afraid lest the bohemian should see me
0	jondrette thenardier , vile rascal !
0	but this confusion vanished ; a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly ; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage
0	loud laughter everywhere , and obscene songs
0	can they have gone out ?
0	he told himself that he must do his duty ; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it ; that if he allowed things to take their own course , if he remained at m sur m , his consideration , his good name , his good works , the deference and veneration paid to him , his charity , his wealth , his popularity , his virtue , would be seasoned with a crime
0	so marius possessed cosette , as spirits possess , but he enveloped her with all his soul , and seized her jealously with incredible conviction
0	in the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the english camp were audible
0	at that moment he was sublime
0	a problem presented itself
0	they had stolen , violated , pillaged , murdered , assassinated
0	i know what it is
0	but be in love gayly then , what the deuce !
0	they were no longer than my thumb , and one had to see the child ’ s little feet come out of them , in order to believe that they had been able to get into them
0	such was the condition of the country when fantine returned thither
0	they have gone for the nearest , to flachot 's place , where there is a farrier ; but it makes no difference ; it will take a good quarter of an hour
0	and , if it was a christmas eve , while the great bell , which seemed to emit the death rattle , summoned the faithful to the midnight mass , such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng , and that the rose window was watching it
0	the stars are like the lamps in illuminations , one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out , i am bewildered , as though horses were breathing in my ears ; although it is night , i hear hand-organs and spinning-machines , and i do not know what all
0	every army has a rear-guard , and it is that which must be blamed
0	he uplifts his hands , utters furious groans , clenches his nails on the beach , tries to cling fast to that ashes , supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath , and sobs frantically ; the sand mounts higher
0	in nailing up the coffin ?
0	but little by little that patience which had borne up under the lash of the torturer , yielded and gave way before all these stings of insects
0	but what proof was there that that thief had been champmathieu ?
0	mother hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account
0	an oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by god , but that adam looked upon her when she was unfolding , and shewas ashamed and turned crimson
0	what a reason for lasting !
0	the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned gavroche of the presence of the policeman , contained no other talisman than the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms
0	the person who had climbed up to that carving must have risked his life
0	nothing now remained to him of his life 's work
0	even when he had thought himself lost , he had not drawn back
0	the passer-by can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet
0	he surveyed him from head to foot , while that personage made exaggerated bows , and demanded in a curt tone : what do you want ?
0	at this name , the shadow ’ s grasp shook the arm of phoebus in a fury
0	when we got home , we could not find it anywhere
0	they talked to him about it for one day ; it was a moment , a flash , as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved ; then all closed again
0	hah ! -- the gypsy watched the priest retire in the direction of the pont notre-dame
0	i swear to you , that it is indispensable that we should be alone
0	i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in bad part ; mohammed had his good points ; respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques !
0	there he beheld more than ever the star , and less than ever savigny and gans
0	these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them
0	she was in unison with father gillenormand ; while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims , she exhaled goodness like a perfume
0	it is a language
0	his intonation admitted of no deliberation
0	it was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people , who called to him from her threshold , in an angry way : a good mayor is a useful thing
0	you can not be even a curate
0	he began to distinguish something
0	corinthe created an obstacle , the rue mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left , no attack was possible except from the rue saint-denis , that is to say , in front , and in full sight
0	thanks to this precaution , which he always was careful to take at the moment when on the point of beginning an examination , he knew beforehand the names , titles , and misdeeds of the accused , made cut and dried responses to questions foreseen , and succeeded in extricating himself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his deafness to be too apparent
0	that congregation of bourgeois habitations , pressed together like the cells in a hive , had a beauty of its own
0	truly , these roastings are a stupendous thing !
0	shouted the furious pedestrian
0	you must know my name
0	in the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities , rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia , employing everything , not losing a single dream , not a single slumber , sowing an animalcule here , crumbling to bits a planet there , oscillating and winding , making of light a force and of thought an element , disseminated and invisible , dissolving all , except that geometrical point , the i ; bringing everything back to the soul-atom ; expanding everything in god , entangling all activity , from summit to base , in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism , attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth , subordinating , who knows ?
0	quasimodo , whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to him , continued to stare intently at the judge , and made no reply
0	the jondrette woman had seated herself beside him
0	mon ami pierrot , tu babilles , parce que l'autre jour mila cogna sa vitre et m'appela , ou vont les belles filles , lon la
0	mother sainte-mechtilde , intrusted with the singing and the choir , was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter
0	he followed it , then lost it
0	coictier tried to grin , shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly , and repeated in a low voice , --
0	he pondered ; he examined the slopes , noted the declivities , scrutinized the clumps of trees , the square of rye , the path ; he seemed to be counting each bush
0	the base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles
0	at reichenau , he gave lessons in mathematics , while his sister adelaide did wool work and sewed
0	i want to keep my child !
0	and she felt herself lifted from the ground
0	you shall never leave us again
0	a few moments after the formation of the battle-array , in the midst of that profound silence , like that which heralds the beginning of a storm , which precedes engagements , the emperor tapped haxo on the shoulder , as he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders , detached by his orders from the corps of erlon , reille , and lobau , and destined to begin the action by taking mont-saint-jean , which was situated at the intersection of the nivelles and the genappe roads , and said to him , there are four and twenty handsome maids , general
0	about two o'clock in the morning , they reckoned up their strength
0	small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented , one the abbe of chaliot , bishop of saint claude ; the other , the abbe tourteau , vicar-general of agde , abbe of grand-champ , order of citeaux , diocese of chartres
0	decazes and deserre were members : -- pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base , [ number ] il faut changer de sol , et de serre et de case
0	at length he released jean valjean , straightened himself stiffly up without bending , grasped his bludgeon again firmly , and , as though in a dream , he murmured rather than uttered this question : what are you doing here ?
0	whispered the young girls , stupefied : tis the captain ’ s name !
0	the outcasts , badly armed foamed and bit with rage
0	it is remarkable that these performances , tolerated and encouraged , no doubt , in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit , were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars
0	and you went to the barricades , and you got yourself killed out of malice !
0	she continued to talk to herself , with her head resting on the pillow : how happy we are going to be !
0	phoebus was no longer there
0	he said of them : they are peasants and not bourgeois ; that is the reason they are intelligent
0	it is well that he has placed himself there
0	the gypsy advanced towards the noble dame
0	one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up , and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether
0	be on fixed wages !
0	a cloister , caught in the very act of asceticism , in the very heart of the city of 'number and of number and of number , rome blossoming out in paris , is an anachronism
0	the first bucketful emptied , the girl drew a second , then a third
0	madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time
0	and you are to be turned out of this one
0	every time that the city cuts a street , the sewer stretches out an arm
0	often , in the midst of his gravest souvenirs , after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent , he returned at night to his apartments , and there , exhausted with fatigue , overwhelmed with sleep , what did he do ?
0	pierre l ’ assommeur and baptiste croque-oison
0	marius , i have an idea
0	and so cold that the pen of the registrar of the parliament froze every three words , in the grand chamber !
0	patience for a little while longer
0	the night was starless and extremely dark
0	but , in any case , whatever may be the future of architecture , in whatever manner our young architects may one day solve the question of their art , let us , while waiting for new monument , preserve the ancient monuments
0	since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood , my son shall take it and bear it
0	i will take it
0	to betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce community something of his own personality
0	no one has ever beheld such outbreaks among the students !
0	she had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of charles x , an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat , and the man 's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning
0	she said to him , she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed , will she not , sir ?
0	be easy , said bigrenaille to thenardier
0	the dinner , as we have said , was drawing to its close
0	marius waited for them all day in vain
0	he took a step and entered the room
0	the personage in black rose
0	this is the case with passive natures
0	then she examined her cell
0	fauchelevent 's confidence was perfect
0	nothing remained of the child , but one of her pretty little shoes
0	the royalists were becoming liberals , liberals were turning democrats
0	for cosette laughed now
0	there was no way of refusing
0	the law is only the law when entire
0	they are greatly in advance to be dead , he exclaimed
0	however , he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb , nor any man as much as an elzevir
0	they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise , a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it
0	the matter is very private
0	cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent
0	the archdeacon did not hear him
0	this caused another loss of twenty minutes ; but they set out again at a gallop
0	i will not come often
0	a moment more , and they would be gone
0	it seemed that this garden , created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries , had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries
0	the case opened by the pressure of a spring
0	neither were the people deceived thereby ; with any one who possessed any sagacity , quasimodo passed for the demon ; claude frollo , for the sorcerer
0	so he will come at six o'clock !
0	but one must practise a bit of hermetic science when one is only procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court , at thirty crowns tournois a year
0	but , from the very first day , that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl 's person , wounded jean valjean 's sombre eye
0	during the night which followed the execution of la esmeralda , the night men had detached her body from the gibbet , and had carried it , according to custom , to the cellar of montfauçon
0	when we select from it some one figure at random , and attempt to make it live again in thought , it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge
0	it is a matter easily understood
0	then she began to laugh again , and added : -do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today ?
0	the poor gypsy shivered when she beheld herself alone with this man
0	one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth , beyond which an open grave was visible
0	bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates
0	jean valjean fumbled in marius ' coat , pulled out his pocket-book , opened it at the page which marius had pencilled , and held it out to javert
0	it has just occurred to me !
0	the doctor had arrived too late
0	he has been recognized by four persons ; the old scamp will be condemned
0	he accorded him a little lofty pity
0	and while speaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing glance from the physician to his companion
0	the bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs ; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else
0	no one knows that this man is a gulf
0	the farm buildings border the courtyard on the south
0	he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue polonceau
0	he was an oracle everywhere
0	matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers
0	let 's have an end of this !
0	quasimodo contented himself with taking him by the girdle , and hurling him ten paces off amid the crowd ; all without uttering a word
0	that is why we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church , or we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church , which will be a good thing
0	he must have been very thirsty : for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink , two hundred paces further on , at the fountain in the market-place
0	gringoire tried to slip in some excuse between these curt words , which wrath rendered more and more jerky
0	i warn you so that you may be prepared
0	you will render me an account of it
0	fantine had remained alone
0	nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret
0	wellington felt that he was yielding
0	must we then retreat in pitiful fashion , like highwaymen ?
0	a passage broken , less than a minute was required for her to seize her daughter by the middle of her body , and draw her into her cell
0	thus the communication between him and them had been prompt , electric , and , so to speak , on a level
0	she was handling the flower instinctively , innocently , without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart
0	i have arranged my mode of life
0	she still cherishes , after her own number and our number , the feudal illusion
0	my own insult belongs to me , i think
0	have you done that , you wretch !
0	but the poor deaf man heard
0	this something or , rather , some one was a blind man , a little blind fellow with a bearded , jewish face , who , rowing away in the space about him with a stick , and towed by a large dog , droned through his nose with a hungarian accent : _facitote caritatem_ !
0	not one paving-stone projects beyond its neighbor
0	later on , this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten , and all this grace ends , with the bourgeois , on two legs , and with the tomcat , on four paws
0	we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the n 's from the bridge of jena !
0	had cast the stain of darkness into his heart , and had made a cain of this abel
0	on her side , cosette languished
0	jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man : charming !
0	marius ' enchantment , great as it was , could not efface from his mind other pre-occupations
0	there then existed at d -- -- a fine inn at the sign of the cross of colbas
0	said father gillenormand , to himself
0	a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things , which was suspicious and underhand
0	unable to rid myself of it , since i heard your song humming ever in my head , beheld your feet dancing always on my breviary , felt even at night , in my dreams , your form in contact with my own , i desired to see you again , to touch you , to know who you were , to see whether i should really find you like the ideal image which i had retained of you , to shatter my dream , perchance , with reality
0	but explain to me how my carriage , which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder , how my good table and the moor-hens which i eat on friday , how my twenty-five thousand francs income , how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty , and that 'number was not inexorable
0	is she still at notre-dame ?
0	do not forget anything that i have said to you
0	he had need of enjolras
0	you will need a stone also , but you can find one outside
0	poor , gentle creature , whose heart had been repressed up to that hour !
0	fantine , without changing her attitude , continued in a loud voice , and with an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending : -he can not come ?
0	now , no one can get out of the barricade
0	father , i accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen
0	he hastened in that direction
0	he will have suffered like mummol
0	however , we make no assertions on this point
0	it has been the scourge of europe
0	it might have been said : ah !
0	he stammered , in a voice stifled with rage
0	jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more ; his hat , which he had flung over the wall , had been found and picked up
0	they defended themselves like desperate men
0	not a point in paris nor in france was exempt from it
0	it had been observed that , ever since his arrival at m sur m his language had grown more polished , more choice , and more gentle with every passing year
0	jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat
0	their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake , which they could see through the branches of the large trees , and which diverted them greatly
0	no trait of the universal face is lacking in the profile of paris
0	he cried , examining it
0	she burst out laughing , and said to her old neighbor : ah !
0	the king ’ s cavaliers , in whose midst phoebus de châteaupers bore himself valiantly , gave no quarter , and the slash of the sword disposed of those who escaped the thrust of the lance
0	cosette , but a year before only an indifferent little girl , would have replied : why , no , he is charming
0	she held a letter in her hand , which she presented to marius
0	only the novices were permitted to lend
0	he was on the verge of swooning
0	you have the air of a merchant of tennis-balls ; and you come and sit yourself beside me !
0	people are pitiless towards happy lovers ; they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone
0	being able neither to finish it nor to retract it , while his daughter arranged the pillow behind marius , who was overwhelmed with so many emotions , the old man rushed headlong , with as much rapidity as his age permitted , from the bed-chamber , shut the door behind him , and , purple , choking and foaming at the mouth , his eyes starting from his head , he found himself nose to nose with honest basque , who was blacking boots in the anteroom
0	i know not why i fell to thinking of the surly monk whom the goat had put into my head again , and then the beautiful girl was rather strangely decked out
0	he was driving at random , straight ahead
0	all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense ; and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers
0	we came across him
0	the doctor is before this table clad in his large coat and covered to the very eyebrows with his furred cap
0	it is midday , said combeferre
0	many thoughts occurred to him ; but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh , and which drove away all others
0	when they had traversed the populace and the place , the cloud of curious and idle were minded to follow them
0	he repeated : long live the republic !
0	the wheel really had suffered serious damage
0	in the chest was a paper , on which these words were written , from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu
0	of that child threatened , of his friends to succor or to avenge , all hesitation had vanished , and he had flung himself into the conflict , his two pistols in hand
0	jean valjean turned pale ; the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder
0	come in , said marius
0	a last word , before we enter on the recital
0	the laugh was cold and sweet , and provoked a shudder
0	the hut was , in fact , so well hidden behind the ruins , and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen , that jean valjean had not perceived it
0	chapter i from charybdis to scylla
0	he heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers , and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern
0	all this was ten fathoms distant from him
0	all at once , on turning round , he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through , far off in the obscurity , something which was moving
0	with scythes , pikes , hackbuts , pickaxes
0	blind is he who will not see !
0	there are men who toil at extracting gold ; he toiled at the extraction of pity
0	jean valjean , his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast , perceived neither basque nor the candle
0	at that moment the wretched archdeacon raised his head mechanically and beheld at the other end of the place , in the balcony of the gondelaurier mansion , the captain standing beside fleur-de-lys
0	people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance ; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town , and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters
0	did not he say that he was setting out on a journey ?
0	she replied with emphasis , --
0	nevertheless , when she beheld her captain enter , she thought him so handsome , his doublet so new , his baldrick so shining , and his air so impassioned , that she blushed with pleasure
0	no , no , i will not listen to you
0	at the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him , and said , go !
0	sure , twas but a sorry game when at paris , dame justice , through having eaten too much spice , set the palace all aflame
0	an idea had occurred to him as he laced his boots , but he rejected it at first ; nevertheless , it returned , and he put on his waistcoat wrong side out , an evident sign of violent internal combat
0	it appears that this red beard was present , at another riot , the quenisset affair , entrusted with this same function
0	it is only artists who can say such things as that
0	marius could not have told
0	he clearly perceived this truth , the foundation of his life henceforth , that so long as she was there , so long as he had her near him , he should need nothing except for her , he should fear nothing except for her
0	we shall , therefore , show nothing of that sweet little flutterof cosette 's rising
0	when jehan saw that it was only this , that is to say , no doubt a physician or a magistrate , and that this man had a nose very far from his mouth , a sign of stupidity , he nestled down in his hole , in despair at being obliged to pass an indefinite time in such an uncomfortable attitude , and in such bad company
0	we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope , leo xii , to one of his relatives , a monsignor in the nuncio 's establishment in paris , and bearing , like himself , the name of della genga ; it contained these lines : it appears that there is in a convent in paris an excellent gardener , who is also a holy man , named fauvent
0	there remains to-day but a very imperceptible vestige of the place de grève , such as it existed then ; it consists in the charming little turret , which occupies the angle north of the place , and which , already enshrouded in the ignoble plaster which fills with paste the delicate lines of its sculpture , would soon have disappeared , perhaps submerged by that flood of new houses which so rapidly devours all the ancient façades of paris
0	he cast the same glance about him , but it was so dull and sleepy that the women only pointed him out to each other in derision
0	an admirable sentiment breaks forth in him , forgetfulness of self and pity for all
0	come now , fair captain , whence comes this overflow of fine words ?
0	below that fire , below the gloomy balustrade with its trefoils showing darkly against its glare , two spouts with monster throats were vomiting forth unceasingly that burning rain , whose silvery stream stood out against the shadows of the lower façade
0	as he went on eating , with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup , his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes , he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it
0	and then it was a fine report in latin , which the sub-monitor of torchi carried piteously to dom claude with this dolorous marginal comment , -- _rixa ; prima causa vinum optimum potatum_
0	all at once , these two poor children , who had up to that time been protected tolerably well , even by their evil fate , were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for themselves
0	he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks
0	my mother is dead !
0	tis as good a spectacle as any other
0	he shut the door , leaned his back against it , and listened to fantine 's despairing supplications
0	jomini divides the battle of waterloo into four moments ; muffling cuts it up into three changes ; charras alone , though we hold another judgment than his on some points , seized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance
0	the sincerity of foulness pleases us , and rests the soul
0	after the fieschi machine , he exclaimed : what a pity that i was not wounded !
0	and the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot
0	let us return to the façade of notre-dame , as it still appears to us , when we go piously to admire the grave and puissant cathedral , which inspires terror , so its chronicles assert : _quæ mole sua terrorem incutit spectantibus_
0	that once conceded , i return to my exhortation
0	thus he remained for nearly a minute , without his presence being perceived
0	the lamentable voice which had proceeded from the cage had frozen all present , even master olivier himself
0	in short , where the roman ladies repaired on one single night
0	nevertheless , he collected all the strength which remained to him for a final effort
0	sometimes this gnat -- that is what he calls himself -- knows how to read ; sometimes he knows how to write ; he always knows how to daub
0	aymoire relates that a stag , being chased by dagobert , having taken refuge near the tomb of saint-denis , the pack of hounds stopped short and barked
0	she is a cricket
0	once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town ; there was present the marquis de champtercier , a wealthy and avaricious old man , who contrived to be , at one and the same time , an ultra-royalist and an ultra-voltairian
0	suddenly exclaimed jacques coictier , what has become of the acute attack of illness for which your majesty had me summoned ?
0	the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own
0	that devil of a marius has ferreted out the nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams !
0	an instant later , the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will , through the rue mondetour , and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street
0	she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence , peculiarly , without exactly being conscious of it
0	the colleges , which are , in fact , the intermediate ring between the cloister and the world , hold the middle position in the monumental series between the hôtels and the abbeys , with a severity full of elegance , sculpture less giddy than the palaces , an architecture less severe than the convents
0	if you had been what i thought you , i should not have been kind to you , not i !
0	what a force is kindly and serious examination !
0	exclaimed cosette when she entered
0	he tried to run towards his mistress , but they had tied him to the bench
0	it brought some pittance to the miserable penitent from time to time , looked through the hole to see whether he were still living , forgot his name , hardly knew how many years ago he had begun to die , and to the stranger , who questioned them about the living skeleton who was perishing in that cellar , the neighbors replied simply , it is the recluse
0	but the woman must be hung , nevertheless
0	she inquired in a changed voice
0	to burn without ceasing to fly , -- therein lies the marvel of genius
0	and an instant afterwards , at the accents which she imparted to this stanza , --
0	she resumed , that horrible , beautiful young lady , who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity , -- she is that beggar brat !
0	these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day
0	the marvels of escape can not always be accounted for
0	then , returning to the subject which absorbed him : -so you are sure that he will come ?
0	the singular point is , observed oudarde , that _la sachette_ has the same idea about the egyptian woman
0	jean valjean strained his ears , and heard something like retreating footsteps
0	louis philippe had been handsome , and in his old age he remained graceful ; not always approved by the nation , he always was so by the masses ; he pleased
0	reload your guns , said enjolras
0	i am a very poor man , and anything but a millionnaire
0	they smashed the only street lantern in the rue de la chanvrerie , the lantern corresponding to one in the rue saint-denis , and all the lanterns in the surrounding streets , de mondetour , du cygne , des precheurs , and de la grande and de la petite-truanderie
0	what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor
0	monsieur madeleine , do not stir from here , and wait for me
0	you are sad every day
0	he was encompassed by space
0	midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment
0	remark , monsieur le baron , that i do not here speak of ancient deeds , deeds of the past which have lapsed , which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god
0	in the eyes of m gillenormand , catherine the second had made reparation for the crime of the partition of poland by purchasing , for three thousand roubles , the secret of the elixir of gold , from bestucheff
0	the thenardier cast a second glance at him , paid particular attention to his frock-coat , which was absolutely threadbare , and to his hat , which was a little battered , and , tossing her head , wrinkling her nose , and screwing up her eyes , she consulted her husband , who was still drinking with the carters
0	the patrol could form a cluster in this open space
0	monseigneur welcome had what the people term a fine head , but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine
0	madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation
0	he was six feet high , his pectoral muscles were of marble , his biceps of brass , his breath was that of a cavern , his torso that of a colossus , his head that of a bird
0	ever since the preceding evening , amid all her amazement , even in her sleep , she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad , and who was so rich and so kind
0	a mourning-coach , in which could be seen a priest in his surplice , and a choir boy in his red cap , followed
0	that pane of glass which is further on , that transparent obstacle , that wall of crystal , harder than brass , which separates all philosophies from the truth , how wouldst thou have overcome it ?
0	had the man succeeded in making his escape ?
0	the winner of the battle of waterloo was not napoleon , who was put to flight ; nor wellington , giving way at four o'clock , in despair at five ; nor blucher , who took no part in the engagement
0	to what purpose shall we diminish it ?
0	but , continued the grave-digger , a man can not serve two mistresses
0	what am i to do on this earth ?
0	she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders , made a low bow to marius , then a familiar sign with her hand , and went towards the door , saying : -good morning , sir
0	in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect
0	it was like a layer of living monsters on the stone monsters of the façade
0	each one demands a bed
0	he was seated on the ground like the others
0	it is in this house , of two stories only , that an illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before
0	to whom do i speak ?
0	the pilasters are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon-balls of stone
0	the young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement , accompanied by a raising of the eyelids , which signifies : well , what is the matter ?
0	i shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing that music from euryanthe that you love , and that you came one evening to listen to , outside my shutters
0	there 's the epoch for you
0	for my part , said favourite , i want it to be of gold
0	the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather , opened it , drew out three bank-bills , which he laid on the table
0	aunt gillenormand had risen
0	this person , the story ran , was a man of means , whose name no one knew exactly , and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years , who knew nothing about herself , save that she had come from montfermeil
0	thanks to the revolution , social conditions have changed
0	in the course of this narrative , the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history ; he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it , and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown to-day
0	the army was mined at the same time as the population , as was proved subsequently by the operations of beford , luneville , and epinard
0	neither did he suspect his glory , any more than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news , with this inscription : bull which carried off the prize at the cattle show
0	on this occasion , however , in the resort to arms of june numberth , number , the great city felt something which was , perhaps , stronger than itself
0	here are the appellations to which the principal members of patron-minette answered , -- for the names have survived in special memoirs
0	moreover , fauchelevent was in a dilemma
0	this point was never explained
0	a sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the rue des filles-du-calvaire
0	in everything it is clean-shaven
0	provided that it was with you
0	nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face , wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good
0	the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel ; a faulty construction , imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries , logical in a prison , illogical in a sewer , and which has since been corrected
0	this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc
0	a vertical section of this kennel , as phoebus had so justly styled it , would have made a triangle
0	after the lapse of a few minutes , he was no longer blind
0	all this was mixed , broken , floating , disseminated confusedly in her thought
0	of course , replied the poet
0	and then my mystery will bring me in a great deal of coined money , if they will only pay me
0	thus , for instance , and we insist upon it , what the chiefs of the insurrection of number , and , in particular , the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chanvrerie were combating , was not precisely louis philippe
0	combeferre followed , carrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos
0	fauchelevent took in his aged , trembling , and wrinkled hands jean valjean 's two robust hands , and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking
0	every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up , to have a place of her own , a chamber
0	he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains
0	he raises his eyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds
0	while the young girl was engaged in opening the package , unfolding the clothing and the blankets , questioning the sick mother kindly , and the little injured girl tenderly , he watched her every movement , he sought to catch her words
0	now this was a case which had not been provided for by law , where a deaf man should be obliged to question a deaf man
0	he replied : -the judge speaks in the name of justice ; the priest speaks in the name of pity , which is nothing but a more lofty justice
0	what had he been intending to do in that region of montfermeil ?
0	the syrian hostess has more grace than mother saguet , but , if virgil haunted the roman wine-shop , david d'angers , balzac and charlet have sat at the tables of parisian taverns
0	it seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now
0	lt was formed of the numberth regiment of highlanders
0	nevertheless , from her dull eyes there escaped a look , an ineffable look , a profound , lugubrious , imperturbable look , incessantly fixed upon a corner of the cell which could not be seen from without ; a gaze which seemed to fix all the sombre thoughts of that soul in distress upon some mysterious object
0	the three women thought her dead
0	the lack of sleep and food , and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of a visionary
0	destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible , and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice
0	my father has served in the armies
0	when it was a question of charity , he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal , and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection
0	many grave persons affirm that , after having exhausted the _fas_ of human learning , he had dared to penetrate into the _nefas_
0	then a lady put punchinello in prison
0	as he owned nothing , he never locked his door , unless occasionally , though very rarely , when he was engaged in some pressing work
0	there are families , but there is nothing of the sort for me
0	at a certain moment , he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising , where the barricades had suppressed circulation , and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris
0	he was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over , and that he should die without having beheld that gentleman again
0	one day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the marche lenoir , and read aloud a singular document , which seemed to emanate from an occult power
0	m gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter
0	when i thought of drowning myself , i said to myself : no , it 's too cold
0	only promise me that you will smile
0	minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs , possibly , said jean valjean
0	an enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the museum of waterloo
0	i will give you warning when you can approach
0	love had bandaged his eyes , in order to lead him whither ?
0	do you take an interest in this affair ?
0	he inquired : -is not the posting-station located here ?
0	enjolras , pierced by eight bullets , remained leaning against the wall , as though the balls had nailed him there
0	between the rue saint-martin and the rue saint-denis , spread the enclosure of the trinité
0	as wood is extremely dear at d -- -- , he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed
0	he had no money , but he found means , when it seemed good to him , to indulge in unbridled extravagance
0	a tempest , which was only rumbling in the distance as yet , was floating on the surface of this crowd
0	let the reader recall the state of his soul
0	now it was the church-bell which spoke , now it was the gardener 's bell
0	everything had plunged through a trap-door once more
0	the slab where marcel cut the throats of robert de clermont and the marshal of champagne , in the presence of the dauphin ?
0	the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration
0	i thought that a fire was unnecessary
0	will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal ?
0	you have so prodigiously saracen a name that i never can get it straight
0	sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe , and slowly descended the endless spirals of revery
0	to-morrow will be too late
0	the vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glass there , as it were
0	there is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil
0	my copy of horace has been stolen
0	put on your shawl
0	in a twinkling , with all the vivacity of an alert old woman , madame magloire had rushed to the oratory , entered the alcove , and returned to the bishop
0	at every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound , which resembled a cry of rage ; the little girls were in ecstasies ; the setting sun mingled in this joy , and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of cherubim
0	he will be here to-morrow , will he not ?
0	this is great to sublimity
0	excess of zeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners
0	the bishop looked at him , and said , -you have suffered much ?
0	she no longer hoped for anything , she no longer knew what she wished , except that she did not wish them to take her daughter
0	now , we say it in good conscience , louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith , and the democracy being in good faith in its attack , the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king nor on the democracy
0	then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he beheld himself , javert , degraded
0	it was evident that fleur-de-lys saw much more clearly than her mother through the captain ’ s cold and absent-minded manner
0	that innocent bud which opens , that adorable half-nudity which is afraid of itself , that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper , that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye , that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle , those cords tied , those clasps fastened , those laces drawn , those tremors , those shivers of cold and modesty , that exquisite affright in every movement , that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm , the successive phases of dressing , as charming as the clouds of dawn , -- it is not fitting that all this should be narrated , and it is too much to have even called attention to it
0	thirty years ago , at the epoch of the insurrection of the numberth and numberth of june , it was still , in many localities , nearly the same ancient sewer
0	england solves the first of these two problems
0	in our opinion , cenobites are not lazy men , and recluses are not idlers
0	as for him , he believed , at the most , that his ear was a little refractory
0	nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing
0	i shall send some one to fetch cosette !
0	the man returns home and dies within the week
0	excited imaginations , say they , are not to be calmed in a day
0	let the reader picture to himself in bacchanal form , salvator rosa ’ s battle
0	the man disappears , then reappears ; he plunges , he rises again to the surface ; he calls , he stretches out his arms ; he is not heard
0	they must be a great trouble
0	fifthly : in the madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen , so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand
0	how cold they are !
0	what 's the use of being two old men , if we are two old fools !
0	he folded his arms , glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein , and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones : as one family !
0	these questions put and answered , he judged society and condemned it
0	at that epoch , father gillenormand was well past his ninety-first birthday
0	i am sure that i know him
0	these men began to talk in a low voice
0	there was in the woman a substratum of the brute , and in the man the material for a blackguard
0	one may smile at it , but one can neither despise nor hate it
0	did he understand too well , or did he not understand at all ?
0	there is a great crowd
0	the point on which we are certain is , that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case
0	jean valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her that , having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother , which permitted him henceforth to live without working , he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him ; but that , as it was not just that cosette , since she had not taken the vows , should have received her education gratuitously , he humbly begged the reverend prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community , as indemnity , for the five years which cosette had spent there , the sum of five thousand francs
0	it was because , of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him , this was the most terrible
0	but , my reverend master , permit me a question in my turn
0	this is my wish
0	be lucky , and you will have all the rest ; be happy , and people will think you great
0	does any one know with whom ?
0	some fine , flowery bonneted wench !
0	g -- -- , at this solemn moment , resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below
0	on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention g -- -- ; he contented himself with pointing heavenward
0	in the centre lay a leather mattress , placed almost flat upon the ground , over which hung a strap provided with a buckle , attached to a brass ring in the mouth of a flat-nosed monster carved in the keystone of the vault
0	it 's so easy to find out a wedding-party that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday , a week afterwards
0	cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that april joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself
0	it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour , said madeleine to the peasants , who were staring at him
0	would that we were lying side by side in the same grave , hand in hand , and from time to time , in the darkness , gently caressing a finger , -- that would suffice for my eternity !
0	she remained thus for more than an hour , without stirring and without breathing , a prey to her thoughts
0	it frequently happened that when m madeleine was passing along a street , calm , affectionate , surrounded by the blessings of all , a man of lofty stature , clad in an iron-gray frock-coat , armed with a heavy cane , and wearing a battered hat , turned round abruptly behind him , and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared , with folded arms and a slow shake of the head , and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose , a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by : what is that man , after all ?
0	can any one picture to himself such a death ?
0	he heaped a hundred reproaches on himself
0	she had followed courfeyrac , had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction ; and , quite certain , since marius had received no warning , and since she had intercepted the letter , that he would go at dusk to his trysting place for every evening , she had betaken herself to the rue plumet , had there awaited marius , and had sent him , in the name of his friends , the appeal which would , she thought , lead him to the barricade
0	they arose to obey
0	and she brought a biscuit to magnon , added guelemer
0	now , it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed , it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes
0	thus is war , made by humanity against humanity , despite humanity , explained
0	grantaire will you do me a service ?
0	did he address this fragment of litany to the holy virgin , or to the pallet ?
0	a ray illuminated cosette 's pale face
0	sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection , and june , number , knew a great deal more about it than june , number
0	all right , said he
0	he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy
0	these groups , warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday , or indistinctly seen in the twilight , occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time , and these visions mingle with his dreams
0	an archbishop ’ s palace has just been demolished , an edifice in poor taste , no great harm is done ; but in a block with the archiepiscopal palace a bishop ’ s palace has been demolished , a rare fragment of the fourteenth century , which the demolishing architect could not distinguish from the rest
0	marius examined the partition , almost unconsciously ; sometimes revery examines , observes , and scrutinizes as thought would
0	if there is no sun , one must be made
0	every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare
0	for the antiquary , hougomont is hugomons
0	one of the men seated at the table , however , was a fishmonger who , before entering the public house of the rue de chaffaut , had been to stable his horse at labarre 's
0	that is deserting one 's family
0	he continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress : -do not weep
0	the young girl remained motionless , frozen with terror , dumb , beneath that terrible apparition , like a dove which should raise its head at the moment when the hawk is gazing into her nest with its round eyes
0	soldiers of the war of number , on whom saragossa had fallen in formidable ruin , frowned in number at the easy surrender of citadels , and began to regret palafox
0	you ca not see your hand before your face
0	on the left cheek
0	why , it is a fortune !
0	as in the ocean , the diver may disappear there
0	do not topple over the edifice
0	the reader already has some idea of it
0	i cried over it
0	not yet , said the doctor , not just now
0	if trophy there be , it is to england that the trophy is due
0	where would you have me go ?
0	and then she was with him , and she felt safe
0	he had just expired
0	the entire day passed thus , quasimodo at his post , la esmeralda on the roof , phoebus , no doubt , at the feet of fleur-de-lys
0	on the first goblet this inscription could be read , monkey wine ; on the second , lion wine ; on the third , sheep wine ; on the fourth , hog wine
0	cosette raised her head and replied : -yes , sir
0	the amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of imagination
0	it is the old oak crowning itself , and which , to heap the measure full , is stung , bitten , and gnawed by caterpillars
0	you shall take your time to love me after i have saved you
0	they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance
0	the archbishop , the kislar-aga of heaven , locked up and kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for god
0	monsieur javert , good monsieur inspector !
0	he breathed , he listened ; not a sound in front , not a sound behind him , and he fled as though pursued
0	it was evident that providence was intervening
0	m madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women 's workroom
0	it is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form
0	i am an honest man , you see ; this child does not belong to me ; she belongs to her mother
0	and a good fill !
0	as for the fourth , no one sees him , not even his adjutants , clerks , and employees
0	then he knelt upon a chair , and basque , who was watching him through the half-open door , made sure that he was praying
0	i shall never see her again !
0	it is always the same fibre which vibrates , the tenderest and most sensitive ; but instead of an angel caressing it , it is a demon who is wrenching at it
0	he was wholly absorbed in spurring on his bells , all six of which vied with each other in leaping and shaking their shining haunches , like a noisy team of spanish mules , pricked on here and there by the apostrophes of the muleteer
0	god will bless you , said he , you are an angel since you take care of the flowers
0	after this stage , he had turned ruffian
0	what misery to think that here is her shoe , and that that is all !
0	alarming details were hawked about , fatal news was disseminated , -- that they were masters of the bank ; -- that there were six hundred of them in the cloister of saint-merry alone , entrenched and embattled in the church ; that the line was not to be depended on ; that armand carrel had been to see marshal clausel and that the marshal had said : get a regiment first ; that lafayette was ill , but that he had said to them , nevertheless : i am with you
0	i should greatly like to know whether it be the mercy of god that there should be in paris any other lord than the king , any other judge than our parliament , any other emperor than ourselves in this empire !
0	this man wore a violet knitted vest , which was old , worn , spotted , cut and gaping at every fold , wide trousers of cotton velvet , wooden shoes on his feet , no shirt , had his neck bare , his bare arms tattooed , and his face smeared with black
0	if one succeeded in passing the porter , which was not easy , -- which was even nearly impossible for every one , for there was an open sesame !
0	the windows were immediately closed , and the poor bourgeois , who had hardly had time to cast a frightened glance on this scene of gleams and tumult , returned , perspiring with fear to their wives , asking themselves whether the witches ’ sabbath was now being held in the parvis of notre-dame , or whether there was an assault of burgundians , as in number then the husbands thought of theft ; the wives , of rape ; and all trembled
0	the porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the emperor
0	it served to save from the cold , the frost , the hail , and rain , to shelter from the winds of winter , to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever , and from slumber in the snow which produces death , a little being who had no father , no mother , no bread , no clothes , no refuge
0	then , turning to his sister : sister , never a precaution on the part of the priest , against his fellow-man
0	in a twinkling , la esmeralda gathered up the unlucky letters , made a sign to djali , and went out through one door , while fleur-de-lys was being carried out through the other
0	thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket
0	fauchelevent will take mestienne off to drink
0	the man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard
0	one of these nests , which has become famous , produced the swallows of the bridge of arcola
0	does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom ?
0	it is in this manner that , in the blindness of a poor political economy , we drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the well-being of all
0	i want the superfluous , the useless , the extravagant , excess , that which serves no purpose
0	the man seemed engaged in prayer , according to his custom , and was much bent over
0	it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella
0	and the priest ’ s brow clouded over again
0	meanwhile , la esmeralda had remained standing
0	fantine was beautiful , without being too conscious of itthose rare dreamers , mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection , would have caught a glimpse in this little working-woman , through the transparency of her parisian grace , of the ancient sacred euphony
0	it takes saint-peter in rome , copies it and parodies it
0	the senator was encouraged , and went on : -let us be good fellows
0	the sun had set behind the lofty tour-de-nesle
0	cosette , after having been your providence , he became mine
0	one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral : - my very dear brethren , my good friends , there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in france which have but three openings ; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings , the door and one window ; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening , the door
0	then the priest felt a large hand dragging him feet first out of the cell ; it was there that he was to die
0	the hair was the same , also the profile , so far as the cap permitted a view of it , the mien identical , only more depressed
0	the malefactor who had been there was father madeleine
0	nevertheless , the attacking column , constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets , drew inexorably nearer , and now , little by little , step by step , but surely , the army closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press
0	it seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the table-land
0	he rummaged in the one or the other , according to circumstances
0	destiny , with its mysterious and fatal patience , slowly drew together these two beings , all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion , these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning , and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire
0	in the meantime a serious incident occurred
0	the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century , which here simulates an arcade , everything else having fallen prostrate around it
0	but the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time ; and , behold !
0	he refused the cross , he was appointed mayor
0	he remained thus , mute , absorbed , evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life
0	marius exclaimed : -i am mortified , sir -- first of all , interposed laigle , i demand permission to embalm blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium
0	this child , who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world , soon became melancholy , and , what is still more contrary to his age , grave
0	she 's not a woman , she 's an ox
0	one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey , and purposely without wearing the air of doing so
0	philosophy is the microscope of the thought
0	he had himself served by the porters , and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs , living on his funds , and having a little temporary resting-place in town
0	so saying , she threw her arms round the officer ’ s neck ; she looked up at him , supplicatingly , with a beautiful smile , and all in tears
0	it meant , printing will kill architecture
0	one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity , and said to his sister , with a smile , there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou
0	said the sister , hardly venturing to put the question
0	revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand , they strike firmly and choose well
0	a captain of fifty men
0	he cried as he fell , and remained as though dead , with his face to the earth
0	i will writhe on the earth , i will break the stones with my forehead , and i will damn myself , and i will curse you , lord , if you keep my child from me !
0	perhaps it would be wise to go abroad , if only for a few months , and to set out for london
0	the parvis was resplendent , and cast a radiance on the sky ; the bonfire lighted on the lofty platform was still burning , and illuminated the city far away
0	by one of those singular effects , which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies , in proportion as his revery continued , as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes , so did jean valjean grow less and vanish
0	i will love you for it !
0	the skilful do not seem to hear the murmured objection , and they continue their manoeuvres
0	and she put on her spectacles
0	and her mother , no doubt , alas !
0	in the same way , there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius , and who had a little of hannibal 's spirit
0	a light troubled by smoke , progress purchased at the expense of violence , only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit
0	he was followed by two pages , who bore the king ’ s toilet articles ; but what struck louis xi
0	while fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness , her native town had prospered
0	her husband beat her
0	it was because , -- strange phenomenon , and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself , -- in stealing the money from that child , he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable
0	the young girl ’ s attention had been attracted to him for the last few moments ; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness ; she had even once come to a standstill , and taking advantage of a ray of light which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently , from head to foot , then , having cast this glance , gringoire had seen her make that little pout which he had already noticed , after which she passed on
0	the sewer had no bottom
0	he stepped to the window
0	she decided to gaze at the sky , as though she thought that marius might come from that quarter
0	he believed in all dreams , railroads , the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations , the fixing of images in the dark chamber , the electric telegraph , the steering of balloons
0	the good god is more than just , said my brother
0	i give you these details , in order that your mind may be set at rest
0	there is , then , an _i_
0	as it drew nearer , it assumed a form , and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition ; the mass grew white ; the day , which was slowly dawning , cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living , the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses , and this is what it proved to be : -seven wagons were driving in a file along the road
0	if he were splitting wood , he cut off a finger
0	enjolras , whose blue eye was not fixed on any one , and who seemed to be gazing at space , replied , without glancing at marius : -france needs no corsica to be great
0	remain gaping ; they hardly recognize him
0	you have not gone ?
0	what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to a mother ?
0	having said all this to himself , he became gloomy
0	because the ground was wet
0	the charming madame de leon , in memory , no doubt , of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse , preferred this appellation to her title of princesse
0	five or six of the provost ’ s men armed themselves with picks and crowbars , and tristan betook himself , in company with them , towards the window
0	our fathers had a paris of stone ; our sons will have one of plaster
0	why was it driving at a walk ?
0	he had for his specialty greece , poland , hungary , roumania , italy
0	well , if you call me monsieur de courfeyrac again , i shall call you mother de veuvain
0	in this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required
0	the difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years , from number to number
0	they were savages , yes ; but the savages of civilization
0	then the woman recognized cosette
0	can not the light penetrate these masses ?
0	behind this house , there were streets , possible flight , space
0	what is there in this incident ?
0	at first , the two women had been very much tried by this door , which was never fastened , but monsieur de d -- -- had said to them , have bolts put on your rooms , if that will please you
0	other deeds , more audacious still , were suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity
0	has your drama been born lame ?
0	feuilly was a workingman , a fan-maker , orphaned both of father and mother , who earned with difficulty three francs a day , and had but one thought , to deliver the world
0	he clung to this thought
0	m felix tholomyes , had he remained in his own province and never beheld paris , would have been one of these men
0	marius paid attention to the manner of this man 's speech
0	he added in his conscience : m madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out
0	the student hardly noticed it
0	monsieur madeleine became monsieur le maire
0	you shall not work any longer if you do not like
0	this spot has become sanctified in my sight , and i have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass
0	just think of it !
0	this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop ; as he was not able to walk , he wished to run : that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning
0	monsieur tranchelevent , i have the honor of asking you , on behalf of my grandson , baron marius pontmercy , for the hand of mademoiselle
0	jean valjean was still in the same place , motionless on his stone post
0	the dragoons advanced at a walk , in silence , with their pistols in their holsters , their swords in their scabbards , their guns slung in their leather sockets , with an air of gloomy expectation
0	it was i who gave you those big eyes , mademoiselle
0	two prodigious shouts went up : lamarque to the pantheon ! -- lafayette to the town-hall !
0	to climb a wall , to break a branch , to purloin apples , is a mischievous trick in a child ; for a man it is a misdemeanor ; for a convict it is a crime
0	then , we will go to the opera
0	i know about that
0	throughout the whole of the month of may of that year number , there were there , in every night , in that poor , neglected garden , beneath that thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day , two beings composed of all chastity , all innocence , overflowing with all the felicity of heaven , nearer to the archangels than to mankind , pure , honest , intoxicated , radiant , who shone for each other amid the shadows
0	interrupted the king ; feed what ought to be hanged !
0	but i do not receive justice
0	they are greatly in advance to be dead , he exclaimed
0	give me back my little agnes !
0	cried a toothless voice
0	the little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars , without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact
0	the bellringer saw him still endeavor to cling to a gable with his nails ; but the surface sloped too much , and he had no more strength
0	in the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied : javert
0	are you going far ?
0	it was as though he had received a galvanic shock
0	marius had just emerged from his : night was falling
0	happy , even in the midst of anguish , is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness !
0	the fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass
0	he descended in all haste , and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du petit-banquier , on its way back to paris
0	i thank you , said the bishop
0	his sister and his sister 's children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which had finally almost completely vanished ; he had made every effort to find them , and not having been able to find them , he had forgotten them
0	he had been walking for about half an hour , at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind , and he had not yet thought of rest ; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius
0	enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside
0	there existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street , so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses , all inhabited , but closed from top to bottom
0	eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this , and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth
0	thus , in number , an order to the inhabitants to light candles in their windows at nightfall , and to shut up their dogs under penalty of death ; in the same year , an order to close the streets in the evening with iron chains , and a prohibition to wear daggers or weapons of offence in the streets at night
0	still , she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair , beautiful eyes , handsome teeth , a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades , that he held himself badly when he walked , if you like , but with a grace that was all his own , that he did not appear to be at all stupid , that his whole person was noble , gentle , simple , proud , and that , in short , though he seemed to be poor , yet his air was fine
0	he knew italian , latin , greek , and hebrew ; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets : dante , juvenal , aeschylus , and isaiah
0	a sort of mud was found in his stomach
0	what did he say to her ?
0	smash that for me
0	there , some one might possibly know her and give her work ; yes , but it would be necessary to conceal her fault
0	what did you do with that cake ?
0	the man who had been gloomy at austerlitz was gay at waterloo
0	are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor 's room ?
0	and it will not cut ?
0	and , seating herself on the old man 's knees , she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement , and kissed his brow
0	the bishop remained silent for a moment ; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital
0	jean valjean followed him with his eyes : a few minutes later , javert turned round and shouted to jean valjean : you annoy me
0	he was about to deliver the colonel 's shade from this unworthy creditor at last , and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father 's memory from the debtors ' prison
0	gaze past the people , and you will perceive truth
0	the peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible
0	i shall have a hammer , a chisel , and some pincers in my pocket
0	however , he redoubled his severity , and had never been more exemplary
0	gavroche did not think of this
0	some time afterwards , m madeleine was appointed mayor
0	whence comes it that it suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it ?
0	just imagine , monsieur javert , he turned me out !
0	where is your stable ?
0	the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases , hard to define , in which there is fatigue , buzzing , murmurs , sleep , tumult , and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place
0	i am quite sure that no charitable person wanted it
0	he who says love , says woman
0	abuses existed , i combated them ; tyrannies existed , i destroyed them ; rights and principles existed , i proclaimed and confessed them
0	and a tear trickled slowly down enjolras ' marble cheek
0	yes , replied the mother
0	i know not what is the matter with me
0	love has no middle course ; it either ruins or it saves
0	beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a poverty-stricken universe
0	greece crowned her mountains with a temple harmonious to the eye ; india disembowelled hers , to chisel therein those monstrous subterranean pagodas , borne up by gigantic rows of granite elephants
0	the police are on our heels
0	i simply require the discharge of inspector javert
0	and then he fell to weeping bitterly
0	what a far grander thing it is to love !
0	he advanced a step , in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay
0	the encyclopedia , in the last century , was a mine that was almost open to the sky
0	he continued to advance
0	said enjolras to the lad
0	they were well punished for their curiosity
0	tholomyes , exclaimed fameuil , listolier and i were having a discussion just now
0	he asked himself what motive could have impelled quasimodo to save her
0	all that had constituted his life , even to his name , was effaced ; he was no longer even jean valjean ; he was number number , number
0	then , with the palm of his energetic hand , he laid the two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast
0	the conventionary resumed : -ah , monsieur priest , you love not the crudities of the true
0	the officer , who was as handsome as a great lord , goes down stairs again with me
0	it flew some colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns , which it returned , shot for shot ; total , twenty-two
0	the second time that marius approached her , the young girl raised her eyelids ; her eyes were of a deep , celestial blue , but in that veiled azure , there was , as yet , nothing but the glance of a child
0	it seems as though we might almost put this question , when we behold so much terrible darkness
0	he had become bankrupt , and was not to be found
0	it was in its place
0	he added , pointing to the stone gibbet
0	do you know what he did , sir ?
0	it was more than a transformation ; it was a transfiguration
0	he has undone the buckle , replied montparnasse
0	inquired marius , who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the thenardiers which his father had bequeathed to him ; who is your brother ?
0	madame de r -- -- continued : you can not obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum
0	now , to our mind , in history , where kindness is the rarest of pearls , the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great
0	i order it , cried enjolras
0	i may meet them
0	the pavement is covered with rubbish ; ribbons , rags , feathers from tufts of plumes , drops of wax from the torches , crumbs of the public feast
0	by degrees , we will admit , a certain horror seized upon him
0	will you keep my child for me ?
0	it is the language of wretchedness
0	cosette had been obliged to give way
0	they might reply : that is because our barricade is made of good intentions
0	but he is always an old man , and , in order that he may always be alone in the garden , and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him , a bell is attached to his knee
0	exclaimed gisquette ; god on the cross , and the two thieves on the right and the left
0	the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy , and at times so tragic , that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon
0	in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing , we shall show only one side and one episode , and certainly , the least known at that , of the two days , the numberth and the numberth of june , number , but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse , beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift , of the real form of this frightful public adventure
0	he entered and said : -i have brought you back your shovel and pick
0	he , jean valjean , had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments
0	one day , -- again the sun was shining brilliantly -- i behold man pass me uttering your name and laughing , who carries sensuality in his eyes
0	what if he were not to come !
0	thus , to sum up the points which we have just indicated , three sorts of ravages to-day disfigure gothic architecture
0	it is true that the night was very dark , that la esmeralda , if she had remained at her post ( and he had no doubt of this ) , was very far away , and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish the lovers on the balcony
0	the words which he uttered the most frequently were : the sensible man , and nature
0	they talked of one thing and another , without passion and with noise
0	on the one hand , he said , the functionary can make no mistake ; the magistrate is never the wrong
0	he covered his eyes with his large hand and retired once more , but slowly
0	that makes a lump that can be seen , said the inspector
0	and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders , and an indescribably exquisite pout , she glanced at marius
0	we will have a royal feast !
0	the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of judgment
0	fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality ; terror is mixed with it , an extenuating circumstance
0	now it converts itself into a flock of birds , scatters itself to the four winds , and occupies all points of air and space at once
0	that is settled then
0	this lad , who had a bold and reckless air , had come by night to join the insurgents
0	i ’ ll play you a chime of rods on your back through the squares of paris !
0	he intervened like an archangel
0	a last word , before we enter on the recital
0	he broke off violently
0	then he bowed profoundly , and directed his steps towards the door
0	he felt himself lost amid all this grandeur
0	a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages ; in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it
0	it was the face of the man with the butcher 's axe
0	jean valjean , with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of this departure , had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumet only at dusk , which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius
0	the forces of the gloom know each other , and are strangely balanced by each other
0	germany is the lymph , italy is the bile
0	little by little , the tide of houses , always thrust from the heart of the city outwards , overflows , devours , wears away , and effaces this wall
0	if he is jean valjean , he has his previous conviction against him
0	under the rue saint-denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii
0	he found himself , all at once , in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls , and beneath a vault which his head did not touch
0	this is what took place
0	it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men , as we have already pointed out , and which , on occasion , extended even to things
0	la esmeralda , said the dancer , never taking her eyes from him
0	i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others
0	when she re-entered the audience hall , pale and limping , she was received with a general murmur of pleasure
0	her eyes were black and splendid ; in the midst of her black locks , some hairs through which the sun shone glistened like threads of gold
0	he raised his eyes , and recognized jean valjean
0	gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter
0	why , i should have to have money , and i have none !
0	in the opinion of that king , anointment meant the galleys
0	father mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls
0	it is not enough to be happy , one must be content
0	it is not comfortable to become a rascal
0	he held both these arms with one hand , and groped along the wall with the other
0	whether this penalty , complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape , had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler , a crime of society against the individual , a crime which was being committed afresh every day , a crime which had lasted nineteen years
0	this ought , in fact , to render him recognizable
0	the inspector stared still more intently at marius , and continued with sententious solemnity : -there , you speak like a brave man , and like an honest man
0	the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes , and answered : -a gentleman of property , like yourself
0	a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips , and she had a black hole in her mouth
0	gisquette glanced at her and did the same
0	she could not endure that terrible face ; she felt her life quitting her ; she hid her face in both hands , and shrieked in her anguish : -monsieur madeleine , save me !
0	he was on the point of turning round , when a paper folded in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head
0	still , in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau , he thought he felt certain that no one was following him
0	still , his first duty was to cosette
0	but it remained motionless in the mist
0	nevertheless , she continued to call jean valjean : father
0	his mind could get along without belief , but his heart could not get along without friendship
0	well , i would like to know what sort of a beggar 's brat this is ?
0	enjolras was the chief , combeferre was the guide , courfeyrac was the centre
0	gold is the sun ; to make gold is to be god
0	make its contour float in a winter ’ s mist which clings to its numerous chimneys ; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices ; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers ; or take that black silhouette again , enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables , and make it start out more toothed than a shark ’ s jaw against a copper-colored western sky , -- and then compare
0	and then he runs the risk of getting crushed !
0	and this soul , found and tested , is a woman
0	you have done me a wrong
0	impulses depend on the first chance word
0	quite a number of old family friends of the gillenormand family had been invited ; they pressed about cosette
0	the magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter
0	i am just from the boulevard , my friends
0	thoughts made their appearance on these faces ; it was a terrible moment ; visible demons with their masks removed , fierce souls laid bare
0	tholomyes replied to none of them
0	there are here with us in the bastille the fifty lances of the vicomte de gif , which makes three hundred horse : you will take them
0	his eyes sparkled with impurity and rage
0	it should be added , that the foundation of the society of the rights of man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paper was found
0	and they set up for judges !
0	mestienne 's head adjusted itself to the cap of fauchelevent 's will
0	ejaculated montparnasse , not so loud
0	sometimes , in his trouble , they fled so far from him , that he had difficulty in recovering them
0	a regicide ending in a senator ; for that is the way they always end
0	in the meantime the legless man , erect upon his feet , crowned gringoire with his heavy iron bowl , and the blind man glared in his face with flaming eyes !
0	for a whole month they had not known what had become of la esmeralda , which greatly pained the duke of egypt and his friends the vagabonds , nor what had become of the goat , which redoubled gringoire ’ s grief
0	thenardier took advantage of this to draw a long breath
0	three years for those four hours
0	the bernardines-benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their order
0	what is your name ?
0	in this , possibly , he made a mistake
0	at night , when they were there , that garden seemed a living and a sacred spot
0	since the departure of the five , they had increased its height still further
0	the same sad , piercing , religious sentiment filled his heart
0	he remained where he was , petrified like the statue of salt , not daring to make a movement
0	well , she resumed , perchance tis that same gypsy girl who is dancing yonder , on the church square
0	but i have no more ink and i must buy some ; i have no more paper , i have no more books , and i must buy some
0	each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway , he said to himself , and yet there are people there within who are sleeping !
0	she no longer said anything , but her eyes flamed
0	but neither their looks nor their tears disturbed the recluse
0	there had been no ring , which was discreet on such a day
0	it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding
0	we ought to mention however , that the sciences of egypt , that necromancy and magic , even the whitest , even the most innocent , had no more envenomed enemy , no more pitiless denunciator before the gentlemen of the officialty of notre-dame
0	no , returned the man , they have more money
0	a company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of the street behind the piece of ordnance
0	i want a drink
0	the frightened vagabonds wheeled round
0	they were warmly clad , but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement
0	the pallet on which m leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed , elevated on four coarse wooden legs , roughly hewn
0	i had learned who you were ; an egyptian , bohemian , gypsy , zingara
0	the devil , who is cunning , took to hating man ; man , who is still more cunning , took to loving woman
0	since a lass there is , try to get a sight of her
0	the golden shells of the collar of saint-michael could be seen gleaming on his neck
0	the other plants turned to nettles and weeds , and died
0	it seemed to them that they were ready to enter a church on the day of tenebrae
0	it was supposed that the messages , which had been addressed , not to houses , but to people who were waiting for them in the street , must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted
0	the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated
0	cosette had one vexation
0	you are going to hang this man ?
0	a red-breast was warbling in the thicket , on one side
0	he liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls , but he rarely made use of it
0	he had just turned the corner of the rue de la coutellerie at a gallop
0	there were ashes in his teeth
0	at the moment when he overtook them once more , they had changed their conversation
0	its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand
0	asked , the thenardier woman
0	is he a poor man ?
0	had he any incentive ?
0	at dessert , the senator , who was slightly exhilarated , though still perfectly dignified , exclaimed : -egad , bishop , let 's have a discussion
0	provided the priest has his basilica and his altar , he has nothing to say
0	we do not think of don quixote but of leonidas
0	do you know where she is , my little daughter ?
0	the slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot
0	what are we coming to ?
0	wait until they begin to put their project into execution ; you are a lawyer ; you know the proper point
0	every minute that passes will make your muscles crack
0	a priest and a philosopher are two different things iii
0	the oratory of italy , established at florence by philip de neri , and the oratory of france , established by pierre de berulle
0	his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas ; they passed like waves , and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them
0	at the most unforeseen moment , and without having ceased to walk in a straight line , he perceived that he was no longer ascending ; the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels , instead of meeting him at his toes
0	the plantain trees were getting their new skins
0	moreover , in spite of all this , and because of all this , this strange dialect has by rights , its own compartment in that great impartial case of pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal , and which is called literature
0	gavroche did not see them again
0	no matter what the quantity of milk they gave , he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital
0	it was cruel to make a tantalus of the chubby-checked boy
0	i thought it was going to rain , and i re-entered the town , to seek the recess of a doorway
0	and moreover , let this be borne in mind , it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago , of the simple sailing-vessel ; steam , then in its infancy , has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel
0	he said to cosette
0	the upper story had scuttles like prisons
0	these facts are the products of revolutions and wars , they are , they exist , they have the right to install themselves in society , and they do install themselves therein ; and most of the time , facts are the stewards of the household and fouriers [ number ] who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles
0	you know well , retorted thenardier , for the little one i just told you so
0	she recognized monsieur the archdeacon of josas , a holy man
0	and then he opened a trunk full of jewels , all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun , which the thieves had given him
0	a coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything , even of imagination
0	but he feels it necessary to say here that he earnestly desires that the future may , some day , put him in the wrong
0	it is a game in which he who loses wins
0	if it had not been for you , i should have been gobbled up !
0	what have you come here for , since it 's a biscuit ?
0	and halting as he was on the point of setting out : -by the way , you will give me his gun !
0	let us make haste , demoiselle mahiette , said the youngest of the three , who was also the largest , to the provincial , i greatly fear that we shall arrive too late ; they told us at the châtelet that they were going to take him directly to the pillory
0	but jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper
0	it was said of him in the town , that is the cousin of the man of grenoble
0	every time that he encountered a branch , he felt of its angles , and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was , he did not enter but continued his route , rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley , and could only lead him further from his goal , that is to say , the outlet
0	he was a tall , thin , livid , utterly funereal man
0	basque and the porter had carried marius into the drawing-room , as he still lay stretched out , motionless , on the sofa upon which he had been placed on his arrival
0	and not only had messire robert d ’ estouteville his special court as provost and vicomte of paris ; but in addition he had a share , both for eye and tooth , in the grand court of the king
0	it was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night , without itself being conscious of it
0	marius made no reply
0	every monday , marius had five francs handed in to the clerk 's office of la force for thenardier
0	they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle
0	the key was in the lock , the door was very close to him ; he gave it a gentle push and thrust his head through the opening
0	that heaven was his conscience
0	life will become monstrous all about you
0	the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen cosette , was now explained to him
0	the majority followed the quay and went through the passy barrier
0	he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him
0	and , besides , it is all cross-roads ; stop !
0	perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them , perchance
0	it was , as we have said , the mother ’ s last bulwark
0	it was the cemetery gate closing
0	he thought of fantine , and felt himself overwhelmed with silence
0	nothing was to be seen , but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt
0	a pile of cassandras , harlequins and columbines , jolted along high above the passers-by , all possible grotesquenesses , from the turk to the savage , hercules supporting marquises , fishwives who would have made rabelais stop up his ears just as the maenads made aristophanes drop his eyes , tow wigs , pink tights , dandified hats , spectacles of a grimacer , three-cornered hats of janot tormented with a butterfly , shouts directed at pedestrians , fists on hips , bold attitudes , bare shoulders , immodesty unchained ; a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers ; this is what that institution was like
0	before father mabeuf , who was easily terrified , and who was , as we have said , quick to take alarm , was able to reply by a single syllable , this being , whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness , had unhooked the chain , plunged in and withdrawn the bucket , and filled the watering-pot , and the goodman beheld this apparition , which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat , running about among the flower-beds distributing life around her
0	in germany , during a given period , summed up by schiller in his famous drama the robbers , theft and pillage rose up in protest against property and labor , assimilated certain specious and false elementary ideas , which , though just in appearance , were absurd in reality , enveloped themselves in these ideas , disappeared within them , after a fashion , assumed an abstract name , passed into the state of theory , and in that shape circulated among the laborious , suffering , and honest masses , unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture , unknown even to the masses who accepted it
0	after which , go whither i push thee , the grave-digger is there ; the pantheon for some of us : all falls into the great hole
0	one would have pronounced it a gigantic stone chess-board
0	his waistcoat astounded a passer-by , who cried in bewilderment : -here are the reds !
0	i should beg alms of them for my poor
0	he was a dissembling prince , but one who understood far better how to hide his troubles than his joys
0	as the sun declined to its setting , casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble , jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain , which was absolutely deserted
0	he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone
0	to stray is human
0	he who becomes betrothed does not always marry
0	the humblest fills his hole , or places his stone
0	she no longer felt , she no longer knew , she no longer thought ; at the most , she only dreamed
0	the indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra
0	in the first place , if you enter this garden , if you lay a hand on this gate , i will scream , i will beat on the door , i will rouse everybody , i will have the whole six of you seized , i will call the police
0	reflect and tremble in the presence of any one who has no glance at all
0	in these aspirations , much more than in deliberate , rational coordinated ideas , is the real character of a man to be found
0	and moreover , who could have guessed such a thing ?
0	it opened wide with a rapid movement , as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push
0	the priest smote his brow
0	jean valjean had killed javert
0	it was he who said : the cardinals are the peers of france of rome ; the lords are the peers of france of england
0	that night , quasimodo did not sleep
0	an instant later , a symphony which had been intended to produce the greatest effect on the arrival of the virgin , was lacking
0	and she left the room
0	to-day the upholders of the past , unable to deny these things , have adopted the expedient of smiling at them
0	the wine-shop alone remained open ; and that for a very good reason , that the mob had rushed into it -- ah my god !
0	their companion was attired in very much the same manner ; but there was that indescribable something about her dress and bearing which suggested the wife of a provincial notary
0	this agony and this immortality are about to join and constitute our death
0	moreover , the cardinal de bourbon was a handsome man , -- he wore a fine scarlet robe , which he carried off very well , -- that is to say , he had all the women on his side , and , consequently , the best half of the audience
0	it was , at the same time , a voyage of discovery
0	old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman
0	he was inordinately homely : the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day , irma boissy , enraged with his homeliness , pronounced sentence on him as follows : grantaire is impossible ; but grantaire 's fatuity was not to be disconcerted
0	thirty men are enough
0	the stories of these prisons , as they sank into the soil , grew constantly narrower and more gloomy
0	give it to me , _bédieu_ !
0	jadis , quand je vis les mantilles de suzette et de zeila , mon ame aleurs plis se mela , ou vont les belles filles , lon la
0	you worry me with your nonsense , there !
0	the fire was out
0	well , go in , then , the rest of you , exclaimed montparnasse
0	have i the time ?
0	on arriving at the first floor , he paused
0	it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the petit-picpus
0	in the meanwhile , gavroche was shouting , at the other end of the barricade : my gun !
0	then they set out again on the march
0	i have seen you for a long , long time
0	he has the eye of a saturn
0	a warning for himself ?
0	other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother societies
0	tis the grotto of neptune
0	every one has cast me out
0	all at once she felt the stranger ’ s hand on hers
0	fair child , said phoebus , with emphasis , taking several steps towards her , i do not know whether i have the supreme honor of being recognized by you
0	but jupiter was standing motionless at the foot of the stage
0	on the contrary , our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them , god has bestowed on them intelligence ; that is to say , the possibility of education
0	sometimes , in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves , though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy , he said to himself : it is her thoughts that are coming to me !
0	_non cuiquam datum est habere nasum_ -- not every one is favored with a nose
0	whether it was not a serious thing , that he , a laborer , out of work , that he , an industrious man , should have lacked bread
0	monsieur , if you are a robber , as i hope you are , you produce upon me the effect of a heron attacking a nutshell
0	pour avoir bu de grand matin la rosee a meme le thym , deux moineaux etaient en ribotte
0	m piet , in the rue therese , no
0	but after all , the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only , -- noise , sayings , words ; less than words -- palabres , as the energetic language of the south expresses it
0	this allusion to the thunder , all the consequences of which gavroche , in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century , accepted , was followed by a broad flash of lightning , so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack
0	a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux
0	does one doubt such things ?
0	the work was clumsy , the worker cross
0	i prefer it to the stall to which i have a right , in my capacity of warden
0	a very sweet life began for him
0	what can be done for it ?
0	they had twelve black hours before them ; they regulated their employment accordingly
0	what have i done to you ?
0	this reflection having brought him to a decision , he plunged resolutely into the small black doorway , and began the ascent of the spiral of saint-gilles , which leads to the upper stories of the tower
0	he had said these things in a loud , rapid , hoarse voice , with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness
0	robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice
0	what the devil ! -- go on ! -- without even deigning to cast a glance of disdain upon the two interrupters
0	the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him , thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it , as we have said , otherwise than faintly and indistinctly , and like a rumbling , in the depths
0	paris combines in an unprecedented type , which has existed and which we have elbowed , grecian nudity , the hebraic ulcer , and the gascon pun
0	wellington went to the village of waterloo to draw up his report to lord bathurst
0	they were finally found , however , hidden in the cellar
0	because it would come to this : the plant wills , therefore it has an _i_ ; the universe wills , therefore it has a god
0	all the glasses of the staff had studied the cloud pointed out by the emperor
0	that which is suitable for a legate , returned the stranger , with a good deal of dryness , is not suitable for a princess
0	time was passing ; he must act quickly
0	men had only touched him to bruise him
0	have pity , young girl !
0	he had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does not understand
0	at the sound of madeleine 's voice she turned around , and from that moment forth she uttered no word , nor dared so much as to breathe freely , but her glance strayed from madeleine to javert , and from javert to madeleine in turn , according to which was speaking
0	some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in that swaddling-band in which the tragic friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuousness
0	a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors
0	all the miasms of the cess-pool are mingled with the breath of the city ; hence this bad breath
0	all at once he threw back his head , his blond locks fell back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars , they were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo , and enjolras cried : citizens , do you picture the future to yourselves ?
0	no singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis , which was already perceptible
0	he had the right to be killed in that barricade
0	here 's supper for three
0	after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor , he never dressed himself in his regimentals , as he said , so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross
0	we are two augurs
0	he made a motion like a man who is just waking up , cast his eyes about him , stared at the audience , the gendarmes , his counsel , the jury , the court , laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench , took another look , and all at once , fixing his glance upon the district-attorney , he began to speak
0	the guardian of justice , in striking caesar , might strike too hard and be unjust
0	one then perceived on the right , facing the window , a glass door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray
0	yes , mother , replied the frightened young girl , they want to kill me
0	i shall follow ; that is my business
0	m fauchelevent talked well , and even with a certain loftiness of language -- still he lacked something indescribable
0	the swans had not yet reached the brioche
0	in any case , he must see the man near at hand , and clear up the mystery
0	long live general lafayette !
0	in the fifteenth century , the seine bathed five islands within the walls of paris : louviers island , where there were then trees , and where there is no longer anything but wood ; l ’ ile aux vaches , and l ’ ile notre-dame , both deserted , with the exception of one house , both fiefs of the bishop -- in the seventeenth century , a single island was formed out of these two , which was built upon and named l ’ ile saint-louis -- , lastly the city , and at its point , the little islet of the cow tender , which was afterwards engulfed beneath the platform of the pont-neuf
0	for one moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now
0	and he went out every day
0	meanwhile , the prisoner could be heard sobbing
0	i will be here at six , and i will fetch you the sixty francs
0	at the priest 's house in chastelar he rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire , who were waiting for him , and he said to his sister : well !
0	g -- -- seemed to be dying because he willed it so
0	the poet ’ s curiosity was more and more aroused
0	here , for instance , i wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper-box makers
0	thou didst put cherries in thy ears
0	you have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister , and lips which claim the kiss of a lover
0	come , now , repeated the provost
0	marius reflected , and allowed her to have her way
0	then that is where marius is going ?
0	but give me some information , in the first place
0	they played , they called to each other , they formed into groups , they ran about ; pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners ; the veils superintended the laughs from a distance , shades kept watch of the sunbeams , but what mattered it ?
0	at the most , he gazed uneasily after dom claude when the latter ascended the staircase of the tower ; but the archdeacon had abstained from presenting himself again before the gypsy ’ s eyes
0	well , but how is this ?
0	let there be no mistake as to our meaning : we are not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress , with the sublime faith , patriotic , democratic , humane , which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect
0	thus the city first presented itself to the eye , with its stern to the east , and its prow to the west
0	a couple of steps from the barrier , a quarter of an hour from here
0	the rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness
0	he broke stones and damaged travellers on the highway
0	she saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden
0	it is certain , that , at that moment , no abuse of power , no violence , not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants , no action of busiris , of tiberius , or of henry viii , could have equalled this in atrocity , in the opinion of marius ; m fauchelevent taking his daughter off to england because he had business there
0	before the bon coing is shut !
0	you did not vote for the death of the king , after all
0	he grasped his son 's hand again
0	he halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope
0	the state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere
0	it was all over with him
0	to the left of the entrance has been fixed the ancient bas-relief , in white marble , of homer ; to the right , the polyglot bible rears its seven heads
0	it was not , however , that m mabeuf had been anything but the calm and impassive agent of providence in this connection
0	it is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming , each the other 's qualities
0	this was more than fantine could bear
0	some days after this visit of a spirit to farmer mabeuf , one morning , -- it was on a monday , the day when marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from courfeyrac for thenardier -- marius had put this coin in his pocket , and before carrying it to the clerk 's office , he had gone to take a little stroll , in the hope that this would make him work on his return
0	at his entrance master florian did not stop short , but , making a half-turn on his heels , and aiming at the provost the harangue with which he had been withering quasimodo a moment before , --
0	that 's the way one goes to heaven
0	all this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness
0	the letters arranged upon the floor formed this word , --
0	he had rested his elbow upon the open volume of _honorius d ’ autun_ , _de predestinatione et libero arbitrio_ , and he was turning over , in deep meditation , the leaves of a printed folio which he had just brought , the sole product of the press which his cell contained
0	hide me in some corner whence i can see whether this woman is really the one whose name you uttered
0	he said at length
0	who was this man ?
0	we shall follow their example , and we shall say m leblanc , in order to facilitate this tale
0	it is not his fault
0	and then , they have cannons in the courtyard of the louvre
0	she heard some one breathing close to her bed ; she drew aside the curtain and saw m madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head
0	she thrust her head through the bars , and succeeded in casting a glance at the corner where the gaze of the unhappy woman was immovably riveted
0	i harnessed him to a carriage
0	only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes
0	they tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn
0	it rained from time to time ; the rain mattered nothing to that throng
0	he had only an old blue coat , and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor
0	it would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he took them with him
0	there can be no fleet , if , beside the sailing ship , that plaything of the winds , and for the purpose of towing it , in case of necessity , there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases , either by means of oars or of steam ; the galleys were then to the marine what steamers are to-day
0	he always thrust his hands into his fobs
0	marius , who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of his early years , interpreted this silence as a profound concentration of wrath , augured from it a hot conflict , and augmented his preparations for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind
0	courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the cafe voltaire on the following morning
0	i am a lioness , i want my whelp
0	giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience
0	it 's almost as good as it is at the ambigu
0	we have not always been as we are now
0	from time to time he coughed ; then he raised the goblet to his lips and drank a draught with a grimace
0	when it is the heart which is slipping , one does not halt on the downward slope
0	a thing which is full of splendor
0	as for his cry of kirikikiou , -- that was , doubtless , what the child had meant , when he said : -you will ask for monsieur gavroche
0	he did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end
0	this number was a sort of lugubrious april
0	he lived in the marais , rue des filles-du-calvaire , no
0	m mabeuf opened his bookcase ; there was nothing there
0	the success of the operation appears to be but moderate
0	we do not know
0	they began to laugh
0	it served to diminish public crime
0	i opened my mouth to reply , and i perceived that there was no one near me
0	at this epoch she said to a neighbor , bah !
0	the one , in some sort , reassured him as to the other
0	a moment later , however , she moved , and they beheld her drag herself , on her knees and elbows , to the corner where the little shoe was
0	it appeared that a bohemian , a bare-footed vagabond , a sort of dangerous mendicant , was at that moment in the town
0	she lost her head over her , she thanked god for her
0	he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop
0	when the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it , and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor , he addressed him with profound respect
0	the grandfather issued this decree : -- he 's an original
0	and courfeyrac , who had overheard , added : he is another sort from father mabeuf
0	the dripping-pan , where crackled a rain of grease , filled with its continual sputtering the intervals of these thousand dialogues , which intermingled from one end of the apartment to the other
0	some persons , however , were still curious , surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends , but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil 's bank-bills , and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret
0	how many are there of them ?
0	moreover , although people were but little surprised by it , the examples of this sort of cloistration in the hearts of cities were in truth frequent , as we have just said
0	doubled in four years !
0	jean valjean did not move
0	they existed vaguely , frightened at their happiness
0	what conjunction that that champmathieu should have been taken for him ; to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which providence seemed to have employed , at first , to strengthen his position !
0	the town-hall of paris took the place of the cathedral of rheims
0	i tried to make use of all my remedies
0	their clothing , which had been clean in magnon 's day , and which had served her as a prospectus with m gillenormand , had been converted into rags
0	it was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall
0	surely , although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves , binds together all these subterranean pioneers who , almost always , think themselves isolated , and who are not so , their works vary greatly , and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others
0	he bounded rather than climbed upon his commode , and resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall
0	we are saving our powder
0	thereupon , the thenardier exclaimed : -ah !
0	they had now attained colossal statures , and it seemed to him that he beheld within himself , in that infinity of which we were recently speaking , in the midst of the darkness and the lights , a goddess and a giant contending
0	this was the first time marius had seen him laugh
0	grantaire , in whom writhed doubt , loved to watch faith soar in enjolras
0	ye who suffer because ye love , love yet more
0	he began at citeaux , to end in clairvaux ; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of chalon-sur-saone , guillaume de champeaux ; he had seven hundred novices , and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries ; he overthrew abeilard at the council of sens in number , and pierre de bruys and henry his disciple , and another sort of erring spirits who were called the apostolics ; he confounded arnauld de brescia , darted lightning at the monk raoul , the murderer of the jews , dominated the council of reims in number , caused the condemnation of gilbert de porea , bishop of poitiers , caused the condemnation of eon de l'etoile , arranged the disputes of princes , enlightened king louis the young , advised pope eugene iii , regulated the temple , preached the crusade , performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime , and as many as thirty-nine in one day
0	cicero was severe towards caesar , and he was right
0	_omnes gurgites tui et fluctus tui super me transierunt_
0	his knees gave way beneath him
0	or you will crawl up a chimney-flue , at the risk of burning ; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe , at the risk of drowning ; i do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask , of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day , of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet
0	i would burn you if you knew what there was in my head
0	she was not dead
0	the elder one undertook the risk
0	may this nail open the tomb to any one who bears the name of phoebus !
0	the largest of all , a sort of colossus , marched on gavroche with his bayonet fixed
0	they were advancing towards him ; these soldiers , at whose head he distinguished javert 's tall figure , advanced slowly and cautiously
0	one inquires , why is there no bucket and pulley to this ?
0	i want to see my child !
0	you have only to ascend the grand staircase
0	it might be accidental , no doubt , certainly , but it was a menacing accident
0	the architectural book belongs no longer to the priest , to religion , to rome ; it is the property of poetry , of imagination , of the people
0	this young man wore the garb of a captain of the king ’ s unattached archers , which bears far too much resemblance to the costume of jupiter , which the reader has already been enabled to admire in the first book of this history , for us to inflict upon him a second description
0	they seemed rather , to be scoffing at other men
0	she was dry , rough , peevish , sharp , captious , almost venomous ; all this in memory of her monk , whose widow she was , and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will
0	no 'number for eve
0	a pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door , left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads
0	about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place
0	he had viewed , almost tranquilly , that coupling of words , in the moniteur : m humblot-conte , peer of france
0	the monotonous rocking of the boat and the ripple of the water had , in some sort , quieted the unhappy claude
0	where are we at this moment ?
0	one would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so
0	he had come , that day , to sleep at the bastille
0	that name he had worn on his heart , inscribed in his father 's testament !
0	in this guise it becomes horrible
0	the horror of death reanimated her , --
0	madame magloire made an expressive grimace
0	at times , amid his convict toil , he paused
0	suffering engenders wrath ; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep , which is the same thing as shutting one 's eyes , the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made spirit which dreams in a corner , and sets itself to the scrutiny of society
0	i am meditating upon that , sire
0	what woke him was that his bed was too good
0	god passes on to the following act
0	that grief never grows old
0	it might open and save you
0	during the last two years , as we have said , paris had witnessed more than one insurrection
0	the mother has no more milk , the new-born babe is dying
0	there is but one reality : drink
0	at intervals the cry of a very young child , which was somewhere in the house , rang through the noise of the dram-shop
0	here 's a lucky girl !
0	that celestial chance , that intervention of the angels , was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief , from the charlemagne courtyard to the lion 's ditch , over the roofs of la force
0	are you turning up your noses ?
0	marius could make nothing out of it , as jondrette stood between the picture and him ; he only saw a coarse daub , and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings
0	that would yield you five hundred francs
0	it is not true that you are a baron ?
0	hence the rapid and innumerable transformations of that architecture which owns but three centuries , so striking after the stagnant immobility of the romanesque architecture , which owns six or seven
0	an indescribable constraint , weariness , and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood
0	fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color
0	in the nineteenth , it begins to reconstruct
0	he added not a word further , and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master
0	accordingly , i denounced you
0	the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure , planted like an old-fashioned french garden
0	do not you think thatit holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it ?
0	they may delude usi am called felix , and i am not happy
0	i do not understand you , said marius
0	sometimes , however , coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon , justice , wisdom , reason , right , formed of the pure snow of the ideal , after a long fall from rock to rock , after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph , insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire , as the rhine is in a swamp
0	and i thought that they were acting against the bailiff !
0	father hucheloup had , possibly , been born a chemist , but the fact is that he was a cook ; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his wine-shop , they also ate there
0	-- had his wish been realized , had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer , he would not have been able to utter a word , and he would have expired with grief
0	he made me traverse it
0	i will go there , afterwards
0	i love the little fellow opposite me in my house
0	is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to that ?
0	that is the result of having pocketed an income ; a note fell due yesterday
0	do you remain outside and observe
0	certain demolitions take place , and it is well that they do , but on condition that they are followed by reconstructions
0	the twilight threw a wan light on his fine brow , and covered his eyes in shadows
0	the doctor recommended silence , and that all painful emotions should be avoided ; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona , and , in case the fever should increase again during the night , a calming potion
0	am i to be like mademoiselle so-and-so ?
0	gavroche pointed to his two proteges , and said : -i am going to put these infants to bed
0	she cried , clasping her beautiful hands sorrowfully
0	not to mention its catacombs , which are a separate cellar , not to mention the inextricable trellis-work of gas pipes , without reckoning the vast tubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains , the sewers alone form a tremendous , shadowy net-work under the two banks ; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding thread
0	it was i who led you here , by the way !
0	hence the advent , apparently tardy , of the tacituses and the juvenals ; it is in the hour for evidence , that the demonstrator makes his appearance
0	this child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago
0	there was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there
0	observe that slender column
0	he who was there aspired to happiness ; life smelled good ; all nature exhaled candor , help , assistance , paternity , caress , dawn
0	none the less did the old legitimist parties assail the revolution of number with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning
0	day before yesterday , i entered the school , by chance
0	have i hurt you ?
0	you ca not go against such things
0	she never went out alone , and toussaint , surprised at such a commission , would certainly show the letter to m fauchelevent
0	he was less lofty , but broader
0	it is the word magnus ; the scotchman makes of it his mac , which designates the chief of the clan ; mac-farlane , mac-callumore , the great farlane , the great callumore [ number ] ; slang turns it into meck and later le meg , that is to say , god
0	no , uttered after that oh !
0	listen , said he to gringoire , fondling his misshapen chin with his horny hand ; i don ’ t see why you should not be hung
0	the guide had answered no
0	for three sous he got as much bread as he wished
0	m gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law
0	the lancer , the officer
0	if he only does not make a mistake !
0	in number , the prioress was young , a sign that the circle of choice was restricted
0	my gabrielle , stoutly , more stoutly !
0	but m madeleine had heard nothing of all this
0	die , if you will , but do not make others die
0	at the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself , so to speak , upon that inward radiance , the sleeping bishop seemed as in a glory
0	he heard his cassock , which was caught on the spout , crack and rip at every jerk that he gave it
0	just see how idiotic one can be !
0	pardon me , monseigneur , the king of thunes , replied gringoire , disputing the ground foot by foot
0	the passer-by cast a glance around him , saw no one , dared not peer into the black niche , and was greatly alarmed
0	claire d'albe and malek-adel were masterpieces ; madame cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch
0	about three o'clock the four couples , frightened at their happiness , were sliding down the russian mountains , a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of beaujon , and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the champs elysees
0	this explanation reassured the child a little
0	a flash pierced her glassy eye
0	after this he made him a sign to rise
0	it was she who had conveyed to jean valjean in the champ de mars the expressive warning : leave your house
0	to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river
0	then find a ladder , clopin !
0	you are accused before us , _primo_ , of nocturnal disturbance ; _secundo_ , of a dishonorable act of violence upon the person of a foolish woman , _in proejudicium meretricis ; tertio_ , of rebellion and disloyalty towards the archers of the police of our lord , the king
0	she shall be my little girl
0	this man had become a just man in the full force of the term
0	passion calmed or lulled to sleep ; something limpid , brilliant , troubled to a certain depth , and gloomy lower down
0	yes , madame , replied the man , raising his hand to his hat
0	so that you may be avoided ?
0	she set her bucket on the ground , thrust her hand into her hair , and began slowly to scratch her head , -- a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do
0	a national guard had read the words saint-simon on the book , and had shouted : death !
0	he told me that he was in good health
0	oh , how hollow does science sound when one in despair dashes against it a head full of passions !
0	he went out with his umbrella under his arm , and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole
0	that would be charming
0	kleber seems to be bellowing !
0	you have arranged that !
0	she fell upon her knees , with her head on her bed , her hands clasped over her head , full of anxiety and tremors , and , although a gypsy , an idolater , and a pagan , she began to entreat with sobs , mercy from the good christian god , and to pray to our lady , her hostess
0	napoleon turning round abruptly , despatched an express at full speed to paris to announce that the battle was won
0	continued the priest , in a voice which seemed to proceed from the depths of his being , behold here a symbol of all
0	souls which blossomed out yesterday , and are faded to-day , like those flowers let fall in the streets , which are soiled with every sort of mire , while waiting for some wheel to crush them
0	as is the case with all good-hearted people , misfortune had eradicated his bitterness
0	it is for the poor
0	the more she looked , the more dazzled she grew
0	his felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him
0	the mother , who had not said a word so far , now rose and demanded in a dull , slow , languid voice , whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state : -what do you mean to do , my dear ?
0	what words were these ?
0	the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin , and it is probable that this personage , who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians , would be no less fine a prize for the authorities
0	the sister dared not question the mayor ; but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there
0	had himself sculptured on his knees before the virgin , and whither he caused to be brought , without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of royal statues , the statues of charlemagne and of saint louis , two saints whom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven , as kings of france
0	listen , said enjolras , laying his hand on combeferre 's arm
0	ecclesiastes calls you the all-powerful ; the maccabees call you the creator ; the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty ; baruch calls you immensity ; the psalms call you wisdom and truth ; john calls you light ; the books of kings call you lord ; exodus calls you providence ; leviticus , sanctity ; esdras , justice ; the creation calls you god ; man calls you father ; but solomon calls you compassion , and that is the most beautiful of all your names
0	his eye had been seen to light up , his muscles to stiffen , his members to concentrate their force , and the straps to stretch
0	i swear to you that there is nothing in this house
0	this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier , the last was barely debauching from the boulevard
0	however , he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of assizes , when the district-attorney , recovering from his first shock , had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of m sur m , to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident , which would be explained thereafter , and to demand , in the meantime , the condemnation of that champmathieu , who was evidently the real jean valjean
0	he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood , in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain , and on a donkey in the mountains
0	the catholic cloister , properly speaking , is wholly filled with the black radiance of death
0	nothing of all this is in existence now
0	what caused him to meditate deeply , and almost reflect , were two cheerful sounds
0	then he stripped himself
0	the wonderful , beautiful girl !
0	by the way , mademoiselle , i ought to have begun there
0	on the afternoon of that same christmas day , number , a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de l'hopital in paris
0	he knew italian , latin , greek , and hebrew ; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets : dante , juvenal , aeschylus , and isaiah
0	four virgins walked in advance
0	as for mother hucheloup , she 's an old warrior
0	you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champmathieu affair , that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury , that the name of fauchelevent had been given to me by fauchelevent himself , out of gratitude for a service rendered to him , and that i might assuredly keep it , and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me , that i should not be in any one 's way , that i should be in my own little corner , and that , while you would have cosette , i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her
0	have you been to what's-his-name 's , in the rue chaffaut ?
0	tis a j , all the same , said the scholar , with his ruddy , merry , and audacious face
0	a pretty woman , on my word !
0	the priest appeared to cast his eyes around the dungeon from beneath his cowl
0	i will lead you to her
0	as we have already explained , in the case of first love , the soul is taken long before the body ; later on , one takes the body long before the soul ; sometimes one does not take the soul at all ; the faublas and the prudhommes add : because there is none ; but the sarcasm is , fortunately , a blasphemy
0	he even said to himself , that a creditor is worse than a master ; for the master possesses only your person , a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear
0	i ask nothing more of you , sir
0	the cardinal burst into a laugh
0	it is probable that , had the match been a poor one , she would have left him poor
0	to make a barricade , replied courfeyrac
0	he went from time to time , now to the rue de l'homme arme , now to the rue de l'ouest , to pass a month or six weeks , without taking toussaint
0	nevertheless , the orchard was taken
0	an hour more of the pillory , in that case
0	paris , -- let us confess it -- willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy
0	the cour des miracles was entirely dark
0	roguet had set the lugubrious example of threatening with death any french grenadier who should bring him a prussian prisoner
0	they brought two thick posts , terminated at their lower extremities in spreading timber supports , which made them stand readily upon the ground ; to the upper extremity of the two posts they fitted a cross-beam , and the whole constituted a very pretty portable gibbet , which gringoire had the satisfaction of beholding rise before him , in a twinkling
0	joiners carried off door-weights of their establishment to break down doors
0	it was the men cocking their guns
0	let them show themselves
0	madame de t had not published the memoirs , out of pride , and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how
0	the only furniture consisted of a straw chair , an infirm table , some old bits of crockery , and in two of the corners , two indescribable pallets ; all the light was furnishd by a dormer window of four panes , draped with spiders ' webs
0	her daughters received nothing but caresses
0	which should he choose ?
0	as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him , jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep
0	resumed gervaise ; is she dead ?
0	you are to come and install yourself here
0	she was the same as a dog to them
0	he seized eponine by the arm : -swear one thing to me !
0	it was necessary to rewrite them or to dispense with them
0	i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun , he said to himself , since i was going hunting !
0	so so , monsieur , replied the thenardier , stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion
0	javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums
0	celestial goodness had , in a manner , captured him by treachery
0	excited imaginations , say they , are not to be calmed in a day
0	one of his oaths was : by the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade !
0	there is always some one with us who is stronger than we
0	life which is , as it were , suspended there , persists there
0	i have just given you fifteen hundred francs
0	no , from the point of view of the individual
0	they were always closed
0	by dint of staring , something vaguely striking in such an agony began to assume form and outline at his feet , as though it had been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold
0	on the following day , jean valjean asked cosette again : -would you like to come to the luxembourg ?
0	i am at my wit ’ s end over him
0	a murmur of consternation arose
0	he had , or thought he had , better wares than that for sale
0	while the men made bullets and the women lint , while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead , destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a glowing brazier , while the sentinels watched , weapon in hand , on the barricade , while enjolras , whom it was impossible to divert , kept an eye on the sentinels , combeferre , courfeyrac , jean prouvaire , feuilly , bossuet , joly , bahorel , and some others , sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life , and , in one corner of this wine-shop which had been converted into a casement , a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built , with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs , these fine young fellows , so close to a supreme hour , began to recite love verses
0	did you go in ?
0	it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours
0	at certain points , there were precipices
0	after the expiration of a few moments , do what he would , he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened , saying that which he would have preferred to ignore , and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear , yielding to that mysterious power which said to him : think !
0	she walked straight up to the bed
0	when he thought on these things , all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity
0	then there was established between them a strange dialogue of signs and gestures , for neither of them spoke
0	you smell nothing of life
0	what a beautiful hempen rope !
0	there was a sort of dark confusion in his brain
0	some neighbors , of whom he made inquiries , put him on the track again ; the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry
0	charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous grimace of a poet in search of a rhyme
0	he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building ; he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise
0	apart from the revolution , which , taken as a whole , is an immense human affirmation , 'number is , alas !
0	he retraced his steps , he called , he did not find them ; he reflected that they must already be far away , put the package in his pocket , and went off to dine
0	wellington was the bareme of war ; napoleon was its michael angelo ; and on this occasion , genius was vanquished by calculation
0	when he had turned the angle of the gallery , the distant glimmer of an air-hole disappeared , the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more , and he became blind again
0	solitude was formed around the tuileries
0	he had a severe face , with a large brow , a profound glance
0	ah , you are attached to something !
0	in the meanwhile , as he went on up the street , he perceived a beggar-girl , thirteen or fourteen years old , and clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible , lying thoroughly chilled under a porte-cochere
0	the noise of the horses began again
0	you would have seen !
0	the prince of orange , desperate and intrepid , shouted to the hollando-belgians : nassau !
0	the night , as we have already said , was very dark
0	ly , he has his own fauna , which he observes attentively in the corners ; the lady-bird , the death's-head plant-louse , the daddy-long-legs , the devil , a black insect , which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns
0	there is no insurrection except in a forward direction
0	he sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day
0	was he actually in hiding from the police ?
0	no address was joined to the signature
0	yonder , on that balcony , at the corner of the place , she had just caught sight of him , of her friend , her lord , phoebus , the other apparition of her life !
0	you do not know where she is ?
0	and she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicated young man
0	he seemed suffocated to such a degree that he could not speak ; his lips moved , and his fleshless fists were clenched
0	jean valjean , who was seated apart on a stone post , at the cornerof the tavern , with his gun between his knees , had , up to that moment , taken no part in anything that was going on
0	after that , i do not think i was mistaken !
0	it was a semicircle of rags , tatters , tinsel , pitchforks , axes , legs staggering with intoxication , huge , bare arms , faces sordid , dull , and stupid
0	lieutenant theodule stood before her , making the regulation salute
0	one would have said , to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance , that he had already , in some previous state of existence , traversed the revolutionary apocalypse
0	and of his own free will , too , the coward !
0	by two o'clock in the afternoon , the table at which they sat was covered with empty bottles
0	how the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party ?
0	every form begins by being night
0	mathias hungadi shook his head
0	nothing made its appearance there
0	but he felt no joy
0	and she shuddered as though with violent cold
0	at wagram , french , thirteen per cent ; austrians , fourteen
0	as for eponine , she was not at her post , she had disappeared , and he had not been able to seize her
0	good day , monsieur claquesous
0	for several moments the young girl , absorbed in her charming thoughts , was dreaming to the sound of his voice , without listening to the sense of his words
0	in fact , if by new , newly made is to be understood , the chapters added to this edition are not new
0	spring came ; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year , that jean valjean said to cosette : -you never go there ; i want you to stroll in it
0	fall of the girondists
0	who are you who are listening to me ?
0	one has lived in death
0	the police , on emerging from the gallery du cadran , had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the belt sewer
0	the people said : there is a rich man who has not a haughty air
0	voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point , while it hides itself
0	my father was there
0	you , father , have not upheld me
0	at that epoch he had just been made , while waiting for the episcopate , vicar-general of the archbishop of paris
0	cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees
0	let us not rest our glance too long on our neighbor ’ s wife , however gratified our senses may be by her beauty
0	they were bottles of aquafortis
0	said mahiette , seizing her child ’ s round head in both hands , i don ’ t want that to happen to me which happened to paquette la chantefleurie
0	he distrusted the capriciousness of women
0	these bare feet , these bare arms , these rags , these ignorances , these abjectnesses , these darknesses , may be employed in the conquest of the ideal
0	that was the beginning of it all
0	if , by chance , an outsider presents herself to see a nun , or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world , a regular series of negotiations is required
0	all at once she ceased speaking , and this caused him to raise his head mechanically
0	when she had passed on , he began to descend the staircase again , with the slowness which he had observed in the spectre , believing himself to be a spectre too , haggard , with hair on end , his extinguished lamp still in his hand ; and as he descended the spiral steps , he distinctly heard in his ear a voice laughing and repeating , --
0	love had only to show himself ; he had here a temple composed of verdure , grass , moss , the sight of birds , tender shadows , agitated branches , and a soul made of sweetness , of faith , of candor , of hope , of aspiration , and of illusion
0	sovereignty of the people
0	she had heard such sighs before
0	all these details which we here lay bare for the edification of the reader , were so covered by the general uproar , that they were lost in it before reaching the reserved platforms ; moreover , they would have moved the cardinal but little , so much a part of the customs were the liberties of that day
0	i certainly did hope to put you in the gutter , and still arrive in time for the fair one , especially as it has a better appearance to make the women wait a little in such cases
0	one then dies within the year
0	but where is the misfortune in this ?
0	clopin trouillefou preaches like the holy father the pope !
0	along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine
0	i was three years old
0	one morning , for all these things happened at night , she no longer saw it , it had been broken
0	they had ended by sharing his confidence , or by at least acting as though they shared it
0	he is very affable
0	homer says : diomedes cuts the throat of axylus , son of teuthranis , who dwelt in happy arisba ; euryalus , son of mecistaeus , exterminates dresos and opheltios , esepius , and that pedasus whom the naiad abarbarea bore to the blameless bucolion ; ulysses overthrows pidytes of percosius ; antilochus , ablerus ; polypaetes , astyalus ; polydamas , otos , of cyllene ; and teucer , aretaon
0	he exclaimed at the full force of his lungs , twining like a serpent around his pillar
0	the hearing has just been begun again , replied the usher , but the door will not be opened again
0	you have to be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt , cut up your sheet to make a rope , punch holes in doors , get up false papers , make false keys , file your irons , hang out your cord , hide yourself , and disguise yourself !
0	below all these mines which we have just mentioned , below all these galleries , below this whole immense , subterranean , venous system of progress and utopia , much further on in the earth , much lower than marat , lower than babeuf , lower , much lower , and without any connection with the upper levels , there lies the last mine
0	give it here , said the archdeacon
0	nevertheless , abandoned as this child was , it sometimes happened , every two or three months , that he said , come , i will go and see mamma !
0	two will be required now
0	dying is a simple affair
0	then he directed his course towards l'orme-saint-gervais
0	the dawn dares when it rises
0	he had trusty fellows , accomplices ' retreats in case of emergencies , in which he would , no doubt , take refuge
0	in the bishop 's own chamber , at the head of his bed , there was a small cupboard , in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night
0	it also was a gloomy and sparsely lighted retreat
0	hos versus dicas , ne tu furto tua perdas
0	there has come into fashion a strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history , of invalidating the commentaries of philosophy , of eliding all embarrassing facts and all gloomy questions
0	whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that word : she
0	it is useless to remove me from this spot
0	ladies , i idolize you all
0	then this child is not yours ?
0	am i going to lose my eyesight now ?
0	in order to reach them the more speedily , he dropped into the rigging , and ran along one of the lower yards ; all eyes were following him
0	when does the porter open that door ?
0	he was supposed to live in courfeyrac 's room , which was decent , and where a certain number of law-books backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance , passed as the library required by the regulations
0	he recalled the violent scene which he had just witnessed in part ; that the gypsy was struggling with two men , that quasimodo had a companion ; and the morose and haughty face of the archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory
0	people ca not have secrets in my forest if i do not have a finger in the pie
0	gringoire covered up his ears
0	the arrobe of castile contains sixteen litres ; the cantaro of alicante , twelve ; the almude of the canaries , twenty-five ; the cuartin of the balearic isles , twenty-six ; the boot of tzar peter , thirty
0	let me give you a piece of advice , my dear fellow
0	jean valjean could not have told
0	the rope about her neck trailed behind her
0	then mademoiselle baptistine , desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother , ventured to say timidly : -did you hear what madame magloire is saying , brother ?
0	it is no longer composed of anything but what is pure ; it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great
0	his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling
0	and the remedy , gossip ?
0	he was hammering the table with his fist , and this is what enjolras heard : -double-six
0	all , with the exception of laigle , were from the south
0	the only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed , and forever
0	that is one way of taking our revenge for the capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us
0	one of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between
0	no one could have told sister simplice 's age
0	they are on earth now
0	dispose of me as you see fit ; but first help me to carry him home
0	that was jean valjean 's secret ; that was also god 's secret
0	he came to her , fell at her knees , and slowly prostrating himself , he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe , and kissed it
0	hence the impossibility of uttering , even for cosette , that name of fantine
0	they distrust the day because it enables people to see them , and the night because it aids in surprising them
0	everything trembled at the sound of her voice , -- window panes , furniture , and people
0	would they stop short at the hairy cuticle , or would they attack the brain ?
0	pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion , but it is certain that caesar laughed
0	should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness ?
0	cries of victory were heard with tolerable distinctness
0	this little shoe was the universe to her , as we have already said
0	the persons present dropped their eyes
0	the depth is sometimes very great
0	and he flourished his shovel briskly
0	when i think how he put himself under that cart !
0	a great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this adventure
0	jean valjean gave this neglected garden over to her
0	have you the password of the outcasts ?
0	he rifled his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer , with swelling fronts , which had not been opened for years -- let us hear the confession of these dowagers , he said , let us see what they have in their paunches
0	i honor it in proportion to its merits ; nothing more
0	blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is tickled in his self-love
0	as the human race mounts upward , the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress
0	that t made the good middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writerin journals which sold themselves , prostituted journalists , insulted the exiles of number
0	the most determined , with enjolras , courfeyrac , jean prouvaire , and combeferre , had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the houses at the rear , unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and guards who crowned the barricade
0	she laid her hand on the latch of the door
0	wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital , a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city
0	a voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to enjolras : so be it
0	the first pupil whom the abbé de saint pierre de val , at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law , always perceived , glued to a pillar of the school saint-vendregesile , opposite his rostrum , was claude frollo , armed with his horn ink-bottle , biting his pen , scribbling on his threadbare knee , and , in winter , blowing on his fingers
0	the care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding
0	the town took a great interest in the trial
0	the acclamation was unanimous ; people rushed towards the chapel
0	not only the needles , thread , and scissors which she had seen , but a big pocket-book , a very large knife , and -- a suspicious circumstance -- several wigs of various colors
0	i do not know , she replied
0	the vermin ditch of benares is no less conducive to giddiness than the lions ' ditch of babylon
0	he looked , and by the light of the lanterns , in the direction of the street which ran into the rue-aux-archives , he perceived a young , livid , and beaming face
0	as conflagrations light up a whole city , so revolutions illuminate the whole human race
0	what a good little king was he !
0	one of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is : i am fine and strong , come now !
0	finally , he made his appearance for the third time upon the summit of the tower where hung the great bell ; from that point he seemed to be showing to the entire city the girl whom he had saved , and his voice of thunder , that voice which was so rarely heard , and which he never heard himself , repeated thrice with frenzy , even to the clouds : sanctuary !
0	that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins
0	as long as he has for refrain nothing but la carmagnole , he only overthrows louis xvi
0	then she dropped the swaddled sword , which only half met her needs , and cast her eyes slowly round the room
0	m de chauvelin had himself called m chauvelin ; m de caumartin , m caumartin ; m de constant de robecque , benjamin constant ; m de lafayette , m lafayette
0	he lodged now with one , now with another , most often with joly
0	you folks warm your feet , you have sakoski boots , you have wadded great-coats , like archbishops , you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters , you eat truffles , you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of january , and green peas , you gorge yourselves , and when you want to know whether it is cold , you look in the papers to see what the engineer chevalier 's thermometer says about it
0	it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him
0	a fleshless arm was stretched from an opening in the wall , and held her like a hand of iron
0	begin at once , went on the other
0	nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth
0	it was , in some sort , without his consciousness , that his hand had relaxed and had let him go free
0	one can say both one thing and another on that score
0	it was a dog 's kennel
0	if i desire to see them !
0	when they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere , sheltered from the rain and from all eyes : -do you know where i am going ?
0	the hall was vast and gloomy , which latter fact made it appear still more spacious
0	to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river
0	it must be cast down
0	then he set his foot on the ladder in order to ascend
0	at the same moment , he pressed the trigger of his rifle
0	there were , indeed , here and there , some inscriptions on the walls , but they were pure sentences of learning and piety , extracted from good authors
0	and all began to laugh
0	i admire enjolras , said bossuet
0	the half-hour struck from saint-medard a while ago
0	glimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted , of a possible revolution
0	no , said gisquette , but what they have said so far
0	hence , deaf though he was , he enjoyed , like a veritable pope , the acclamations of that throng , which he hated because he felt that he was hated by it
0	around the city , outside the ramparts , sight was lost in a great circle of fleecy vapors through which one confusedly distinguished the indefinite line of the plains , and the graceful swell of the heights
0	and he seized javert 's gun
0	i said to my sister : is it a gentleman ?
0	for some time , jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people
0	revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad
0	he answered harshly and angrily : as you see , my good woman , i am sleeping
0	it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it
0	the headsman loveth that ; he eats the beast afterwards
0	brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison
0	then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant , that he appears black because it is nightfall ; that he is not digging any hole whatever , but is cutting grass for his cows , and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back , and whose teeth , thanks to the perspective of evening , seemed to spring from his head
0	the ground of the university was hilly ; mount sainte-geneviève formed an enormous mound to the south ; and it was a sight to see from the summit of notre-dame how that throng of narrow and tortuous streets ( to-day the latin quarter ) , those bunches of houses which , spread out in every direction from the top of this eminence , precipitated themselves in disorder , and almost perpendicularly down its flanks , nearly to the water ’ s edge , having the air , some of falling , others of clambering up again , and all of holding to one another
0	gibelotte , tall , delicate , white with a lymphatic pallor , with circles round her eyes , and drooping lids , always languid and weary , afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude , the first up in the house and the last in bed , waited on every one , even the other maid , silently and gently , smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile
0	at the moment when he made his appearance in the full daylight beneath the lofty arched portal , enveloped in an ample cope of silver barred with a black cross , he was so pale that more than one person in the crowd thought that one of the marble bishops who knelt on the sepulchral stones of the choir had risen and was come to receive upon the brink of the tomb , the woman who was about to die
0	have you never seen a revolt , master jacques ?
0	to be a priest !
0	it is the rule of saint-benoit
0	the mire bears up more or less , according to its density
0	well , what of it ?
0	a moment later , she laid her finger on her lips , and made a sign to mahiette to draw near and look
0	their faces almost touched
0	later on , he had sold in little parcels , for gardens and market gardens , the lots of ground adjoining the corridor , and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes , and did not even suspect the long , paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and their orchards
0	it certainly was the outlet , but he could not get out
0	but she did not seem to hear him
0	and if you have little ones , when they howl have you nothing in your vitals that moves ?
0	here are the names of the principal ones
0	he said with rapture , and he threw his arm round the gypsy ’ s waist
0	cried the child , my white piece !
0	she took a good look , and heard the beasts walking on the grass , and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees
0	cosette , she said , almost gently , come immediately
0	on the following day , m leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the luxembourg ; they went away while it was still broad daylight
0	the name of whom ?
0	when he learned it , he knew not what his sensations were
0	greece becomes greece again , italy is once more italy
0	if i am not deseaved in my opinion , i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor
0	but it is necessary to add , that the key was never removed
0	nevertheless , he could account for it
0	the child was standing with his back to the sun , which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its blood-red gleam the savage face of jean valjean
0	but the poor man who is generous and noble , and who does not work , is lost
0	by dint of discussing political matters , vaguely and without precision , from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all men , they came to say a little more than yes and no
0	it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps , muddy , chalky , plaster-stained , dusty steps , of the same width as itself , which could be seen from the street , running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls
0	however , after supper he said : monsieur le cure of the good god , all this is far too good for me ; but i must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do
0	there is nothing to expect ; nothing to hope for
0	she rejoined , he is right !
0	the supreme smile is god 's alone
0	to terminate this duel , to amalgamate the pure idea with the humane reality , to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact and the fact into right , that is the task of sages
0	and how do i know what else ?
0	the soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions
0	we might almost , so far as courfeyrac is concerned , stop here , and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains : for courfeyrac , see tholomyes
0	it was a large sou of this sort which , during the subsequent search of the police , was found under the bed near the window
0	the vagabonds recovered their courage ; soon the heavy joist , raised like a feather by two hundred vigorous arms , was flung with fury against the great door which they had tried to batter down
0	in short , what cause is more just , and consequently , what war is greater , than that which re-establishes social truth , restores her throne to liberty , restores the people to the people , restores sovereignty to man , replaces the purple on the head of france , restores equity and reason in their plenitude , suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself , annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord , and places the human race once more on a level with the right ?
0	madame magloire , retorted the bishop , you are mistaken
0	something within me had fallen never to rise again , something had come upon me from which i could not flee
0	below sat the clerk of the court , scribbling ; opposite was the populace ; and in front of the door , and in front of the table were many sergeants of the provostship in sleeveless jackets of violet camlet , with white crosses
0	come , you know well enough
0	animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices , straying before our eyes , the visible phantoms of our souls
0	tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal ; sainted souls do not detest this
0	and marius stupidly counted them ; there were still five of them !
0	what is the matter , javert ?
0	moreover , he did not understand what it was that was moving behind him
0	take my advice , bourgeois , let 's leave fear of the red to horned cattle
0	you are disobeying the regulations , my friend
0	said the king ’ s advocate roughly , he is dying
0	jondrette made a sinister gesture , and said : -we will fix him
0	if tis the gallows that you wish , go to the grève
0	he regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail-wagon , in which he had engaged his place
0	in four days i have spent only twenty-five sous , which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse
0	it has done nothing but rain all summer ; the wind irritates me ; the wind does not abate
0	only a few posting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes and the hotel meurice
0	he had no arms , and he made great haste , so that he might not be left behind , although he had a thoughtful air
0	do you know what is done then ?
0	he began to wander about the streets , the resource of those who suffer
0	here is the philanthropist
0	she no longer felt any fatigue
0	he had been able to form a judgment as to the unconquerable modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy , and he had mathematically calculated the resistance of that chastity to the second power
0	it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of gayety , that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be enticed , that the system of spying , and serving as caryatids to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them , that the crowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags , half dung , half light , roll by on four wheels howling and laughing , that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames , that there would be no festival for the populace , did not the police promenade in their midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy
0	in the parvis there were several groups of curious good people , who were tranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing himself in so strange a manner
0	one would have thought they were young roman dames thrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave
0	i might interrupt you at this point , said marius , but go on
0	the chest was opened ; it contained a cope of cloth of gold , a mitre ornamented with diamonds , an archbishop 's cross , a magnificent crosier , -- all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame d'embrun
0	for having come from the rue glatigny !
0	be one of the gods
0	you are doing well
0	this is a law
0	his feline eye had just descried , in the recess of a carriage door , what is called in painting , an ensemble , that is to say , a person and a thing ; the thing was a hand-cart , the person was a man from auvergene who was sleeping therein
0	it makes one shudder to think of it !
0	grumbled a toothless old woman who was present
0	one would have pronounced her now a mad creature , now a queen
0	every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense feebleness it affords men food for thought , hence in the ports curious people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation , without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why
0	captain , replied the deaf man , do you not ask me who it is ?
0	she returned to her bed , saying to herself : he is very uneasy !
0	the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard ; it hinted at poverty
0	the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius
0	otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific military tactics
0	in the basket there was a bottle , bread , and some provisions
0	the word should have been unpublished
0	two tables further on , a palmer , with his pilgrim ’ s costume complete , was practising the lament of the holy queen , not forgetting the drone and the nasal drawl
0	i almost doubt it
0	you are too good , you see !
0	happy painter , jehan fourbault !
0	then he passed to the frontier of italy , and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert
0	cosette dressed herself very hastily , combed and dressed her hair , which was a very simple matter in those days , when women did notswell out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs , and didnot put crinoline in their locks
0	then , suspended above the abyss , borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell , he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps , pressed it between both knees , spurred it on with his heels , and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body
0	for my part i do not tremble before a poppy , the little red hat inspires me with no alarm
0	all at once , he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder
0	would you wish to see me die in this horrible fashion before your very eyes ?
0	a very important thing
0	women have very depraved tastes !
0	tis not written that because one is of small account one should take fright at a great enterprise
0	he ’ s eating the plaintiff , he ’ s eating the suits , he eats , he chews , he crams , he fills himself
0	i will discover the parish of that parishioner
0	four , the most audacious , who were running on in front , were mown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt , and this courageous throng of national guards , very brave men but lacking in military tenacity , were forced to fall back , after some hesitation , leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement
0	resistance was born on the morrow ; perhaps even , it was born on the preceding evening
0	his gaze , fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him , seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass
0	jean valjean felt himself delivered
0	i am your humble servant !
0	but you have come too early
0	this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the champs-elysees , difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions , on account of its excessive fluidity
0	at that moment she heard a voice saying to the provost : _corboeuf_ !
0	they stopped up their ears to the musket shots , closed their shutters , barricaded their doors , allowed the matter to be concluded with or without the watch , and the next day it was said in paris , etienne barbette was broken open last night
0	france is made to arouse the soul of nations , not to stifle it
0	well , you have had a revolution since i had the honor to see you last
0	what conclusion was to be drawn from this , except that they all come from the same person ?
0	it was at this last post that the emperor said to his guide , lacoste , a hostile and terrified peasant , who was attached to the saddle of a hussar , and who turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind napoleon : fool , it is shameful !
0	the friends of the a b c were not numerous , it was a secret society in the state of embryo , we might almost say a coterie , if coteries ended in heroes
0	above all things , do not speak to me of the officer ! -- i would cast myself at your knees , i would kiss not your feet , but the earth which is under your feet ; i would sob like a child , i would tear from my breast not words , but my very heart and vitals , to tell you that i love you ; -- all would be useless , all ! -- and yet you have nothing in your heart but what is tender and merciful
0	had he , in lending to this stranger the aid of his key , and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal , the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin ?
0	if one of my subordinates had done what i have done , i should have declared him unworthy of the service , and have expelled him
0	it strikes me , master pierre gringoire , he said to himself , placing his finger to his brow , that you are running like a madman
0	he stopped a beadle who emerged from the cloister , -- where is monsieur the archdeacon of josas ?
0	die at the beginning of so sweet a thing !
0	if he is drunk , i shall say to him : be off ; i will do your work for you
0	it is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what i am
0	marius came to a full knowledge of that rare , sweet , and sublime man , that species of lion-lamb who had been his father
0	all his blood had retreated to his heart
0	in his mind , all is sedition , rebellion pure and simple , the revolt of the dog against his master , an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel , barking , snapping , until such day as the head of the dog , suddenly enlarged , is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion
0	it was through it that , under the empire and the restoration , prisoners condemned to death re-entered paris on the day of their execution
0	one has only to read arnoul wion , gabriel bucelin , trithemus , maurolics , and dom luc d'achery
0	to lean one 's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect , which attitude is not hated by thinkers
0	they wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles , and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white
0	she set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber
0	when he had no longer any weapon , he reached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm or other into his fist
0	yes , sir ; if such is your fancy , you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs
0	through this the chief justice entered , so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere , and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue blomet
0	for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive , any ordinary and charitable man , evidently their indigence would have been noticed , their signals of distress would have been perceived , and they would have been taken hold of and rescued !
0	now it was the thenardier who appeared to her , with her hideous , hyena mouth , and wrath flashing in her eyes
0	marius , petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable , made a sign with his head that he did not
0	he soon reached his last sou , never his last burst of laughter
0	lower down , confusedly , at the limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible , one perceives other gloomy men , who perhaps do not exist as yet
0	i told him , but he would not listen to me
0	three hundred and forty-eight years , six months , and nineteen days ago to-day , the parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city , the university , and the town ringing a full peal
0	we should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves , were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop , or a patriotic cure
0	he said in the tone of a man just waking up
0	the french revolution , which is nothing else than the idea armed with the sword , rose erect , and , with the same abrupt movement , closed the door of ill and opened the door of good
0	why do you not work ?
0	when he re-entered the streets , the passers-by elbowing each other by the light of the shop-fronts , produced upon him the effect of a constant going and coming of spectres about him
0	there was then neither hatred for the cardinal , nor disdain for his presence , in the disagreeable impression produced upon pierre gringoire
0	he had an affable and haughty air , and a mouth which was always smiling , since it did not shut
0	then , all of a tremble , i call the watch
0	they were forced to content themselves with those four stretches of rubble work , backed with sandstone , and a wretched stone gibbet , meagre and bare , on one side
0	-- and this interrogation : but where is it that he goes ?
0	but the young girl had had time to catch a glimpse of it ; her eyes closed again with terror
0	there is also a pleasant garden , which consists of a pond , an aviary , an echo , a mall , a labyrinth , a house for wild beasts , and a quantity of leafy alleys very agreeable to venus
0	she will be grown up now ! -- unhappy child !
0	chopped up , nettles are good for poultry ; pounded , they are good for horned cattle
0	the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man
0	what a fine noise !
0	at that period of the solstice , the light of full noonday is , so to speak , poignant
0	i can not give you any dinner
0	he saw cosette every day , he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more , he brooded over the soul of that child , he said to himself that she was his , that nothing could take her from him , that this would last indefinitely , that she would certainly become a nun , being thereto gently incited every day , that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him , that he should grow old there , and that she would grow up there , that she would grow old there , and that he should die there ; that , in short , delightful hope , no separation was possible
0	each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there
0	i tell you that you sha not enter this house , because it does not suit me
0	however , if these good haudriettes were , for the moment , complying with the statutes of pierre d ’ ailly , they certainly violated with joy those of michel de brache , and the cardinal of pisa , which so inhumanly enjoined silence upon them
0	what did the man want ?
0	more than half of what i possess is swallowed up in an annuity ; so long as i live , it will not matter , but after my death , a score of years hence , ah !
0	what are names of your two friends ?
0	strange to say , she had grown poorer and prettier , two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take
0	these good ladies are not at all fond of that visit
0	the day had been strange and filled with emotions for cosette
0	he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks , in order to remind himself continually of his starting-point , but he had concealed all that came from the galleys , and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen
0	good , he said to himself , there go all the mischief-makers
0	he shall taste it !
0	he will be as indefatigable in defending our historical edifices as our iconoclasts of the schools and academies are eager in attacking them ; for it is a grievous thing to see into what hands the architecture of the middle ages has fallen , and in what a manner the botchers of plaster of the present day treat the ruin of this grand art , it is even a shame for us intelligent men who see them at work and content ourselves with hooting them
0	waterloo was against the english
0	between the old and the new rue du temple , there was the temple , a sinister group of towers , lofty , erect , and isolated in the middle of a vast , battlemented enclosure
0	he had , accordingly , hoisted himself , during the first verses of the prologue , with the aid of the pillars of the reserve gallery , to the cornice which ran round the balustrade at its lower edge ; and there he had seated himself , soliciting the attention and the pity of the multitude , with his rags and a hideous sore which covered his right arm
0	had , in fact , been two days in paris
0	here this man was joined by a second , who walked with the same caution , then by a third , then by a fourth
0	come , work now , tis the feast of the annunciation
0	a grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson ; in default of a lawyer one takes a lancer
0	the nearest edifices to them were the bishop ’ s palace and the church
0	sweetness and depth , they are the whole of woman ; in them lies the whole of heaven
0	six hundred thousand francs
0	while expressing his approval of jean valjean 's silence , he endeavored to force him to talk
0	only one -- beside me on the box , said the coachman
0	as three days in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers , six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty
0	this is the manner in which they reasoned
0	as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them : the prayers of the postulants are frightful , the prayers of the novices are still worse , and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse
0	no , brother , tis for a good work
0	; the president , in his summing up , had joined the counsel for the defence , and in a few minutes the jury had thrown champmathieu out of the case
0	no one knows who has been there or will be there
0	i have just told you my opinion of athens
0	fauchelevent , who had recovered himself a little , exclaimed : -but how will you manage to breathe ?
0	they know not what it means !
0	in february , you sent her a bill of five hundred francs ; you received three hundred francs at the end of february , and three hundred francs at the beginning of march
0	as a whole , it was not over a hundred years old
0	she made her customary pretty grimace
0	the fatigue of a great grief not infrequently produces this effect on the mind
0	the man inquired : -have you a place ?
0	come , child , he said to cosette ; and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise
0	as far as sayings are concerned , this child has as many of them as talleyrand
0	this convict was on his way to fling the body into the river
0	then he whispered in his ear , with a smile : i must give you your entry to the revolution
0	a certain good dram-shop keeper of pantin des vertus or la cunette , whose establishment had been closed by the riots , became leonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall , and got himself killed to preserve the order represented by a tea-garden
0	the first effect was to dazzle him
0	sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside , or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust
0	fire on the villains !
0	well , now , said gringoire , here ’ s one at last who speaks a christian tongue
0	the recluse breathed freely once more
0	at bottom , led back to the truth by their very force , they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists ; it is with them only a question of definition , and in any case , if they do not believe in god , being great minds , they prove god
0	why did this man give no sign of life to marius , who owed everything to him ?
0	the search was continued until the evening : they did not even find the body
0	revery , which is utterly spontaneous , takes and keeps , even in the gigantic and the ideal , the form of our spirit
0	when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death , we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back
0	laigle de meaux , whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging , perceived , athwart his somnambulism , a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place , at a foot pace and apparently in indecision
0	i am playing , returned the child
0	claude frollo had been destined from infancy , by his parents , to the ecclesiastical profession
0	he swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor , to which a boat was moored
0	he was violent and florid , as district-attorneys usually are
0	and then , to face the worst , there was danger only for himself , and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys
0	the vagabonds behaved bravely
0	through it one could confusedly distinguish the front of notre-dame , and the decrepit hôtel-dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights of its roof all checkered with dormer windows
0	if i disappear , what happens ?
0	if my mother were to return , she would see your hand !
0	one would have pronounced them two statues confronting each other
0	they waited one , two , three , five minutes , a quarter of an hour ; nothing came
0	behold me then , in the garments of a stage-player , like saint genest
0	there is something of the apocalypse in civil war , all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes , revolutions are sphinxes , and any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream
0	i think his name was m guillaume lambert
0	everything had plunged through a trap-door once more
0	nothing of this triumph reached fauchelevent in his hut ; he went on grafting , weeding , and covering up his melon beds , without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity
0	one looked at it and spoke low
0	the cardinal de cl t had been brought to madame de t s by his most intimate friend , m de roquelaure , former bishop of senlis , and one of the forty
0	guillaume longuejoue would beat me
0	a whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring aloftfar be it from me to insult the pun !
0	he uttered these names incessantly , appropriately and inappropriately , with the tenacity of right
0	from the tower where we are placed , the hôtel saint-pol , almost half hidden by the four great houses of which we have just spoken , was still very considerable and very marvellous to see
0	as for marius ' inward political revolution , m mabeuf was totally incapable of comprehending it , of willing or of directing it
0	tis not i who say that , but didymus of alexandria , and they are illustrious words
0	each mind is a mason
0	i am an unlucky wretch ; i am left outside
0	then he began to pace up and down the room , listened at the corridor , walked on again , then listened once more
0	i know not what you mean
0	he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done
0	no one had thought of bidding her farewell , nor had she thought of taking leave of any one
0	in addition to this , they had behind them the battery , which was still thundering
0	at last she appeared to come to a decision
0	it all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre
0	the bishop returned home , deeply absorbed in thoughts which can not be known to us
0	thus the associations for the liberty of the press , for individual liberty , for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes
0	moreover , i had but to open a book , and all the impure mists of my brain vanished before the splendors of science
0	to adore each other for eight days was hardly worth the while !
0	hence , there was nothing very cordial in his manner when jacques coictier said to him , --
0	being two divisions , there were two columns of them ; wathier 's division held the right , delort 's division was on the left
0	or i will search you , were you as leprous as job , and as scabby as caesar !
0	at eighteen , he had already numerous corpses in his past
0	he was enveloped in a mantle to his very nose
0	she cast a glance upon it
0	was there nothing to be done ?
0	in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing , a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall , and at its bottom , in large letters , was the inscription : the dream
0	he imagined that m leblanc was darting angry glances at him
0	he is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket
0	he appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to gavroche 's lodging
0	a little soil , no care , no culture
0	and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose
0	azrael , the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre , would have turned back , and thought that he had mistaken the door
0	it is faithful , brave , chivalric , loving , devoted
0	the arch was closed by a heavy grating , and the grating , which , to all appearance , rarely swung on its rusty hinges , was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock , which , red with rust , seemed like an enormous brick
0	there was one exception , however
0	what a star art thou , o youth !
0	little by little , this hallucination was succeeded by a less bewildered and exaggerating view
0	is it a criminal case ?
0	the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon ; cosette caused the dawn of love to rise
0	she speedily despatched nicolette to m jean 's house to inquire whether he were ill , and why he had not come on the previous evening
0	zero not wishing to go stark naked , clothed himself in vanity
0	the priest overturned quasimodo on the floor with a kick , and , quivering with rage , darted back under the vault of the staircase
0	he went from time to time , now to the rue de l'homme arme , now to the rue de l'ouest , to pass a month or six weeks , without taking toussaint
0	the corpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few paces distant
0	his breath sank , his glance grew grander
0	tin tin tin pour pantin
0	jehan , to whom his back was turned , could see only his shoulders and the back of his skull ; but he had no difficulty in recognizing that bald head , which nature had provided with an eternal tonsure , as though desirous of marking , by this external symbol , the archdeacon ’ s irresistible clerical vocation
0	while the old man regretted , marius applauded himself
0	i owe my fishwife day to the prefecture
0	in proportion as he left the palais-royal behind him , there were fewer lighted windows , the shops were fast shut , no one was chatting on the thresholds , the street grew sombre , and , at the same time , the crowd increased in density
0	a hand projected from beneath the winding sheet and hung near the floor
0	god does not will it
0	it wo not screech under the saw , and it wo not be hard to cut
0	i do not know exactly ; dumont , or daumont , or some name of that sort
0	there was no exit possible from this oratory , except by passing through the bedroom , nor from the bedroom , without passing through the dining-room
0	my sister said to me : i think it is a gentleman
0	he took breath , smiled and resumed : cosette , thou wert talking to me , go on , so thy little robin red-breast is dead ?
0	the last of these stalls , established precisely opposite the thenardiers ' door , was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel , glass , and magnificent objects of tin
0	let us see , those who have families must be tractable , and shake hands with us and take themselves off , and leave us here alone to attend to this affair
0	a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop , an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal , carries you with him as conclavist ; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction , you receive the pallium , and behold !
0	behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall
0	below ran this inscription : at the sign of sergeant of waterloo ( au sargent de waterloo )
0	the fifteen-sou piece was not there
0	she was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity
0	all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport
0	marius , in addition to his motives of political antipathy , was convinced that his father , the slasher , as m gillenormand called him on his amiable days , did not love him ; this was evident , since he had abandoned him to others
0	two new spokes and a hub must be made
0	about three-quarters of an hour before midnight ; do not forget
0	at forty a man is done for
0	a few moments later , the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round
0	i join them , and you must make haste
0	it is father mestienne 's fault
0	the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern ; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless , and , as we have just seen , any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness
0	the fleming called his wife , and related the affair to her
0	there is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration , and in the midst of raging seas , beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals , a tranquil nook
0	the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut
0	and he was seized with a fit of melancholy
0	for having been passed and received master of the said trade !
0	marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old
0	his dream was to naturalize indigo in france
0	as for the bourbons , the war of number was fatal to them
0	the sewer was now descending
0	there was spider corner , caterpillar corner , wood-louse corner , and cricket corner
0	thenardier thrust out his head a very little
0	and you never quarrel !
0	it 's the archives , is not it ?
0	cried marius , and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood
0	one of the charming little loves is already fairly spitted
0	the bishop clapped his hands
0	the priest says that we shall find her at the rat-hole
0	listen , suddenly cried enjolras , who was still on the watch , it seems to me that paris is waking up
0	these felicities are the true ones
0	had he become -- a grave matter in a general -- unconscious of peril ?
0	the judge supposed that it had been replied to , and continued , --
0	madame magloire alone had frights from time to time
0	another , in order to get a look at debacker as he passed , and being too small in the crowd , caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it
0	in the meanwhile , love and suffer , hope and contemplate
0	the gallows leads to hell
0	in point of fact , three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance
0	but the weeks passed by , years passed ; to m gillenormand 's great despair , the blood-drinker did not make his appearance
0	what do you take me for , my friend ?
0	he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall
0	it was not deserted ; here and there along its extent crawled certain vague and formless masses , all directing their course towards the light which flickered at the end of the street , like those heavy insects which drag along by night , from blade to blade of grass , towards the shepherd ’ s fire
0	said the scholar ; tis here , no doubt
0	he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost
0	she must have suffered much , and she must have still been suffering greatly , for she said to herself , that her father had been unkind ; but she counted on marius
0	so you have no wish to harm me !
0	this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin labarre , and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colbas
0	said oudarde , whose attention was less impatient
0	ly , two cardinals , m de la luzerne , and m de cl t
0	or who say they do
0	this was produced by the buffet of an archer , or the horse of one of the provost ’ s sergeants , which kicked to restore order ; an admirable tradition which the provostship has bequeathed to the constablery , the constablery to the _maréchaussée_ , the _maréchaussée_ to our _gendarmeri_ of paris
0	she did not go so far as : i told you so !
0	i have not even been able to discover the secret of cassiodorus , whose lamp burned without wick and without oil
0	what was this strange house ?
0	no one throws anything away any more
0	and the four miserable philippes which he has brought me !
0	the excess of tin renders them too tender
0	there , no more than elsewhere , did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment
0	he lacked majesty ; he wore no crown , although a king , and no white hair , although an old man ; his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new ; a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited number ; louis philippe was transition reigning ; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern ; he loved poland and hungary , but he wrote les polonois , and he pronounced les hongrais
0	what do you expect us to do with a glass door , tubercle ?
0	you do not want any more , my men ?
0	the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet
0	it is fathomless , since it is god
0	he says to himself : well !
0	father , pursued marius , my good father , if you only knew !
0	he traversed the mountain on mule-back , encountered no one , and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends , the shepherds
0	then he saw moscow
0	was not that everything ?
0	nevertheless , when our poet beheld quiet reestablished to some extent , he devised a stratagem which might have redeemed all
0	as for the bishop , it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine , and it was a long time before he recovered from it
0	this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d -- -- as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop , her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church
0	the dining-room was an antechamber as well , and separated the two bedrooms
0	i know a prettier one , said she
0	violent resistance ; conclusion : a refusal
0	jehan observed , with a sigh , that there was no frying-pan
0	i know all the ropes and the devices
0	some abominable fright that will make us shudder , probably !
0	what he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age , it was the mysterious mark of death
0	then he withdrew behind the cart , with his men in livery surcoats
0	compassion , which is the same thing as clemency , causeth the love of subjects , which is the most powerful bodyguard to a prince
0	in the good humor of that winter of number , paris had disguised itself as venice
0	did not he fall into the trap !
0	a huge cellar had been constructed there , closed by an old iron grating , which was out of order , into which were cast not only the human remains , which were taken from the chains of montfauçon , but also the bodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent gibbets of paris
0	the woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart , which is infallible
0	brother , replied the scholar , making an effort to assume a decent , pitiful , and modest mien , and twirling his cap in his hands with an innocent air ; i am come to ask of you --
0	he recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the rue polonceau eight years before , and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape ; it was difficult then , to-day it was impossible
0	mutilations , amputations , dislocation of the joints , restorations ; this is the greek , roman , and barbarian work of professors according to vitruvius and vignole
0	he had a pocket-book about him ; the same one which had contained the note-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for cosette
0	the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning ; after the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock and midnight , nothing more has taken place ; the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak ; but that makes no difference , from the moment when that man is concerned in this war , he is lost ; he is caught in the gearing
0	it 's you , you scamp ?
0	he cast his eyes about him ; but there was no hope : all were laughing
0	however , manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg saint-marceau
0	they retraced their steps
0	leave me alone a little !
0	was it a fortress ?
0	if it were thus , -- as there comes in all human society a moment when the sacred symbol is worn out and becomes obliterated under freedom of thought , when man escapes from the priest , when the excrescence of philosophies and systems devour the face of religion , -- architecture could not reproduce this new state of human thought ; its leaves , so crowded on the face , would be empty on the back ; its work would be mutilated ; its book would be incomplete
0	has monsieur le maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter ?
0	from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which , arrested there in its passage , no doubt , had floated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart
0	she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance
0	this had given her , when very young , and even a little later , a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband , a scamp of a certain depth , a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar , coarse and fine at one and the same time , but , so far as sentimentalism was concerned , given to the perusal of pigault-lebrun , and in what concerns the sex , as he said in his jargon -- a downright , unmitigated lout
0	he proposed , and she agreed
0	bind me as you please , but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man
0	in truth , i think a great deal of that child
0	a national guardsman who had taken aim at enjolras , lowered his gun , saying : it seems to me that i am about to shoot a flower
0	enjolras was the chief , combeferre was the guide , courfeyrac was the centre
0	how could you go to live in a street like that , which is sickly , which is disagreeable , which is ugly , which has a barrier at one end , where one is cold , and into which one can not enter ?
0	a moment later he turned the corner of the rue des precheurs
0	from that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could
0	how am i to pay them ?
0	he wrote the following letter to fantine 's dictation , and made her sign it : -you will deliver cosette to this person
0	what do you mean to say ?
0	and the cathedral was not only society for him , but the universe , and all nature beside
0	there is one thing sadder than to see one 's children die ; it is to see them leading an evil life
0	that which had been merely illustrious , had become august
0	there are thoughts which play us the same trick ; they nestle awayin a corner of our brain ; that is the end of them ; they are lost ; it is impossible to lay the memory on them
0	he is not responsible to men
0	in what way did you go thither ?
0	the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner ; it devours , it eats flesh , it drinks blood ; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter , a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
0	in a relative measure , and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled , the exception is just
0	and he thought no more about it
0	take a few steps , and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe , where ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of ivry to the sound of thunder , as in the melodramas
0	in the gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede a wedding
0	mon coeur un beau jour s'envola
0	a strange shade , gradually drawing nearer , extended little by little over men , over things , over ideas ; a shade which came from wraths and systems
0	tiny feet that people came even from epernay , which is seven leagues away , to see !
0	it is a serious matter
0	but not a spark of gold
0	one of the survivors of this expedition , an intelligent workingman , who was very young at the time , related curious details with regard to it , several years ago , which bruneseau thought himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police , as unworthy of official style
0	he had no children
0	then he returned to the barricade and said : it is done
0	he was very gay , but one felt the force of government in him ; there was dictation in his joviality ; his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of nankeen , with straps of braided copper wire ; he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand , and , as he treated himself to everything , a strange thing called a cigar in his mouthnothing was sacred to him ; he smoked
0	paris alone has this in its natural history
0	he had entered in despair ; he emerged gloomy
0	that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
0	and he seated himself , utterly breathless , wiping away the great drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched , like tears , the parchments spread out before him
0	cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed
0	jean valjean tottered , dropped the blotter , and fell into the old arm-chair beside the buffet , with drooping head , and glassy eyes , in utter bewilderment
0	at the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to traverse
0	the tavern-keeper is there , said montparnasse
0	with this he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes
0	it is not time
0	however , the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety , her daintiness , her lively manners , her dances , and her songs
0	they do not consent to be black
0	if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind , you are deserving of pity ; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and of peace , you are more worthy than any one of us
0	at the moment when that name , which he had buried beneath so many layers , was so strangely articulated , he was struck with stupor , and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny ; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks
0	an ashy gleam dimly lighted this scene , and the gallows grew more and more distinct in the square
0	i love you -- do not open your mouth ; refrain from speaking to me rather , if it be only to tell me that you hate me
0	from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which , ten years before , cosette had quitted montfermeil ; first the little gown , then the black fichu , then the stout , coarse child 's shoes which cosette might almost have worn still , so tiny were her feet , then the fustian bodice , which was very thick , then the knitted petticoat , next the apron with pockets , then the woollen stockings
0	she had a great deal of fever that day
0	the raven flies only by day , the owl flies only by night , the swan flies by day and by night
0	this is what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous
0	marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him
0	do you think so ?
0	monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money
0	he was utterly upset , he would have liked to be very handsome , he would have liked to own the cross
0	there was no means of opening the gate
0	by dint of ransacking his memory , he recalled in a vague way that he had already , many years before , had a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect that he might well be this very individual
0	the eye was , for a long time , wholly lost in this labyrinth , where there was nothing which did not possess its originality , its reason , its genius , its beauty , -- nothing which did not proceed from art ; beginning with the smallest house , with its painted and carved front , with external beams , elliptical door , with projecting stories , to the royal louvre , which then had a colonnade of towers
0	since that time , two powerful romancers , one of whom is a profound observer of the human heart , the other an intrepid friend of the people , balzac and eugene sue , having represented their ruffians as talking their natural language , as the author of theday of a condemned man did in number , the same objections have been raised
0	well , what of that ?
0	god preserve me from it !
0	the sky had been overcast all day long
0	they form a part of his laboratory
0	monseigneur , he asked , where am i to enter ?
0	among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds , there was one sceptic
0	happily , an unexpected incident came to his rescue
0	his father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence , but by whom ?
0	the courageous took to arms , the poltroons hid
0	that is to say : enter
0	the priest interrupted him : is it agreed
0	the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window , and shouted to her in a thundering voice : -quick !
0	all at once , she burst into tears
0	they would not allow the child to come into the printing office , because he was in the way , they said
0	that is legal and delightful
0	now , according to local tradition , this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered number-number on the boulevard de l'hopital
0	we do not know where we are to sleep , replied the elder
0	j'ai froid , ma mere
0	the elder of the two children , who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood , uttered this exclamation : -it 's queer , all the same
0	this struck him as strange ; usually , there was no noise in m madeleine 's chamber until he rose in the morning
0	he 's in the first carriage
0	but the author is far from regarding as accomplished , the task which he has voluntarily imposed on himself
0	; bailiffs , aldermen , burgomasters ; burgomasters , aldermen , bailiffs -- all stiff , affectedly grave , formal , dressed out in velvet and damask , hooded with caps of black velvet , with great tufts of cyprus gold thread ; good flemish heads , after all , severe and worthy faces , of the family which rembrandt makes to stand out so strong and grave from the black background of his night patrol ; personages all of whom bore , written on their brows , that maximilian of austria had done well in trusting implicitly , as the manifest ran , in their sense , valor , experience , loyalty , and good wisdom
0	this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent
0	one of the sergeants of police was obliged to notify master charmolue of the fact , as the latter , during this entire scene , had been engaged in studying the bas-relief of the grand portal which represents , according to some , the sacrifice of abraham ; according to others , the philosopher ’ s alchemical operation : the sun being figured forth by the angel ; the fire , by the fagot ; the artisan , by abraham
0	twas he who pushed us on hither , and he has deserted us in the very middle of the job !
0	that 's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way !
0	will not that suffice you ?
0	these fishwife vehicles , in which one feels one knows not what shadows , set the philosopher to thinking
0	the one is magnificent , the other sublime
0	for , let us insist upon this point , masonry must not be thought to be powerful only in erecting the temple and in expressing the myth and sacerdotal symbolism ; in inscribing in hieroglyphs upon its pages of stone the mysterious tables of the law
0	it is worth the journey
0	he did that to spite me !
0	he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story , which ended in the abduction of a child
0	these lofty deeds of rascality have no future
0	but a humid warmth near his ear , which the mouth of the wounded man touched , indicated respiration , and consequently , life
0	all at once , towards the end of february , number , it was discovered that brujon , that somnolent fellow , had had three different commissions executed by the errand-men of the establishment , not under his own name , but in the name of three of his comrades ; and they had cost him in all fifty sous , an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal
0	good , you can laugh , you are not speaking seriously
0	a very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways
0	what my brother does is well done
0	they entangled him under a fresh system of thongs and buckles ; he allowed them to bind and buckle him
0	he started , for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the rue plumet
0	when they had finished , when they had told each other everything , she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him : -what is your name ?
0	by the way , dom claude , i bring you a colleague who has desired to see you on account of your reputation
0	one can almost see distinctly there
0	have you no longer any kind feeling for your father ?
0	fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent
0	they laid gavroche on the same table with mabeuf , and spread over the two corpses the black shawl
0	what was the number ?
0	and , then , they drive at a walk
0	destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences , differing in age , alike in sorrow
0	absorbed in cosette , he had not even clearly put it to himself that this eponine was named eponine thenardier , and that she bore the name inscribed in his father 's will , that name , for which , but a few months before , he would have so ardently sacrificed himself
0	nevertheless , he advanced as rapidly as possible
0	hence we accept it and we adopt it , like all the rest of the world , to characterize the architecture of the second half of the middle ages , where the ogive is the principle which succeeds the architecture of the first period , of which the semi-circle is the father
0	this was a touching and august instant , all heads uncovered , all hearts beat high
0	this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable ; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion
0	he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment , and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated ; but if he had been strongly pressed , it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican
0	there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the baker 's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary 's
0	he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring
0	his eyes were deep , his lids a little red , his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful , his brow was lofty
0	this recurred to his mind unceasingly
0	it certainly was not ursule
0	i always thought there was some evil history back of all that
0	from time to time she heard the loud laughter , the noisy voice of quasimodo in her ear ; she half opened her eyes ; then below her she confusedly beheld paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and tiles , like a red and blue mosaic , above her head the frightful and joyous face of quasimodo
0	on the same day when the papal nuncio , on the one hand , and the cardinal de la roche-aymon on the other , both devoutly kneeling , were each engaged in putting on , in his majesty 's presence , a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry , who had just got out of bed
0	as soon as enjolras folded his arms and accepted his end , the din of strife ceased in the room , and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity
0	he inquired of another pupil , a charming brunette with rosy cheeks , who stood near him : -who is that ?
0	they aimed at him constantly , and always missed him
0	behold him in the sand up to his belly , the sand reaches to his breast , he is only a bust now
0	she was learned , erudite , wise , competent , curiously proficient in history , crammed with latin , stuffed with greek , full of hebrew , and more of a benedictine monk than a benedictine nun
0	the reader has probably not forgotten that a part of the cour de miracles was enclosed by the ancient wall which surrounded the city , a goodly number of whose towers had begun , even at that epoch , to fall to ruin
0	the years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment
0	under the axle-tree hung , like drapery , a huge chain , worthy of some goliath of a convict
0	that shoe has so much grace and daintiness , it is so impossible for it to walk , that it seems to the mother as though she saw her child
0	one morning , this spy saw jean valjean , with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar , entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel
0	what do you want ?
0	a subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable
0	the archdeacon and the gypsy had come into conflict in his heart
0	when he cried , sinite parvulos , he made no distinction between the little children
0	by any other route than that below plancenoit , the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery , and bulow would not have arrived
0	hide in your chamber , so that you may be supposed to have gone out
0	the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him
0	the recluse remained for several moments motionless and petrified , then she moved her head in sign of doubt , and suddenly giving vent to a burst of laughter , but with that terrible laugh which had come back to her , --
0	and then , as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back , there is no longer any one at faverolles who knew jean valjean
0	a terrible moment ensued , during which the poor portress felt as though she should faint
0	resumed gringoire , growing warmer and warmer , and supposing that , after all , he had to deal merely with a virtue of the cour des miracles ; am i not thine , sweet friend , art thou not mine ?
0	he raised his glance to the crucifix
0	there were some people standing about
0	some people maintained that he was a mysterious person , and that no one ever entered his chamber , which was a regular anchorite 's cell , furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of dead men !
0	and without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him !
0	he did not kill javert , but he is a murderer
0	when one knows how to look , one finds the spirit of a century , and the physiognomy of a king , even in the knocker on a door
0	he must rest for two days at least
0	there , trembling lest the aunt should turn round , concealed behind a pillar , motionless , not daring to breathe , he gazed at his child
0	some said that she had been seen to quit reims at nightfall by the fléchembault gate ; others , at daybreak , by the old basée gate
0	ask that demagogue of a marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a cosette
0	there is a spectacle more grand than the sea ; it is heaven : there is a spectacle more grand than heaven ; it is the inmost recesses of the soul
0	he loved the word citizen , but he preferred the word man
0	the road was so narrow at the braine-l'alleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart , as is proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery , and which gives the name of the dead , monsieur bernard debrye , merchant of brussels , and the date of the accident , february , number
0	her magnificent blond hair was plaited in a ravishing manner , she was dressed entirely in that sky blue which becomes fair people so well , a bit of coquetry which she had learned from colombe , and her eyes were swimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better
0	said robin poussepain still all bruised with his fall
0	even family names have disappeared
0	the same sack on their backs , the same rope around their loins
0	to lie is the absolute form of evil
0	the old man exclaimed , without either waiting for or hearing her response : -what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor , and that i cando nothing for you !
0	the aspect of the locality has changed
0	this , replied fauchelevent , is so that i may be avoided
0	at last i behold happiness close beside me !
0	said gringoire , to the archdeacon
0	as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle , it is called without distinction , to make reparation or to be at the post
0	the edifice had also sounds fraught with such benediction and such majesty , that they soothed this ailing soul
0	it 's idiotic ; you looked like a calf
0	then the women laughed and wept , the crowd stamped with enthusiasm , for , at that moment quasimodo had a beauty of his own
0	in good faith , perchance , and deceiving itself , devotee that it is
0	for the due de modena , speaks slang
0	without a card , he could not get back into the cemetery
0	the immaculate one is there , and very fierce
0	from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers
0	the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy
0	the arms of mothers are made of tenderness ; in them children sleep profoundly
0	bareheaded , he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house
0	in plain sight , on the open boulevard , he placed one knee on the ground , shouldered his weapon , fired , killed the commander of the squadron , and turned away , saying : there 's another who will do us no more harm
0	this perhaps , so dear to philosophers , emboldened gringoire
0	the escort troop cursed , the men in chains did not utter a syllable ; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls ; some of these men were yawning ; their rags were terrible ; their feet hung down , their shoulders oscillated , their heads clashed together , their fetters clanked , their eyes glared ferociously , their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses ; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter
0	he has been in the galleys , said thenardier
0	his father had ended by owning a house and a field ; but he , the son , had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation
0	but the task of sages is one thing , the task of clever men is another
0	as for convents , they present a complex problem , -- a question of civilization , which condemns them ; a question of liberty , which protects them
0	this impression had even one stronger and more profound point about it , that it was indeed the tower of strasbourg , but the tower of strasbourg two leagues in height ; something unheard of , gigantic , immeasurable ; an edifice such as no human eye has ever seen ; a tower of babel
0	enjolras was a chief , combeferre was a guide
0	the retort was a harsh one , but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel
0	that must have been blachevelle 's idea , resumed favourite
0	beside her shadow , the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow , which was particularly startling and terrible , a shadow which had a round hat
0	i think i should have done better to strain my onions
0	before he had finished the exordium , the perspiration was starting from his brow , and his eyes from his bead
0	this wall hears , sees and will not
0	according to the philosophers , the eternal father ; according to the jacobins , the supreme being
0	his mouth is unstopped at last
0	he perceived from the king ’ s cold and indifferent mien that there was no other resource than something very pathetic , and he flung himself at the feet of louis xi , exclaiming , with gestures of despair : --
0	the hell where you are , shall he paradise ; the sight of you is more charming than that of god !
0	the dinner is paid for
0	a satin pelisse , a velvet bonnet , boots , and everything ; more than two hundred francs ' worth of clothes !
0	to-day , it is my turn ; i am going to eat the gypsy -- oh !
0	a series of faint , sharp noises resounded confusedly along the wall of paving-stones
0	if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history , the one would have been the just , the other the wise man
0	it would be a good thing to have two men for it
0	the flour is no fault of ours
0	that 's why we get on well together , my coat and i
0	in houses where people are among themselves , i am superfluous
0	at this oath , which was the favorite of louis xi , some one seemed to awaken in the interior of the cage ; the sound of chains was heard , grating on the floor , and a feeble voice , which seemed to issue from the tomb was uplifted
0	the advocate ’ s trade taketh all the grain , and leaveth only straw to the other scientific professions
0	rosier than the satin of the shoes !
0	marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father , and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying
0	when the door was barricaded , enjolras said to the others : let us sell our lives dearly
0	accordingly , he assumed an extremely soft tone and began , --
0	but he suffered ; he suffered so that at intervals he tore out handfuls of his hair to see whether it were not turning white
0	you shall come when you will , he continued , turning to tourangeau , i will show you the little parcels of gold which remained at the bottom of nicholas flamel ’ s alembic , and you shall compare them with the gold of guillaume de paris
0	the populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence
0	there is also a rascal of a tree which is called the lewd , because it favored the pleasures of a famous princess and a constable of france , who was a gallant and a wit -- alas !
0	these poor living beings , these creatures of god , henceforth without support , without guide , without refuge , wandered away at random , -- who even knows ? -- each in his own direction perhaps , and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies ; gloomy shades , into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads , in the sombre march of the human race
0	one day , the air was warm , the luxembourg was inundated with light and shade , the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning , the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees
0	i know not , said he
0	it is a perpetual i love you
0	he did not succeed in this
0	and how about food ?
0	shrieked boulatruelle , shaking his fist at the horizon
0	said the king , between two swallows of his ptisan
0	between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference -- that its logic may end in war , whereas its philosophy can end only in peace
0	he was barricading himself against possibilities
0	the ensemble was glacial , regular , hideous
0	the government sends a coffin
0	and they would rush off !
0	the reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the _i_
0	enjolras held a pistol in his hand
0	let me climb up , m'sieu le gendarme , said the gamin
0	with that poor marius
0	she was declared an orphan , both father and mother being dead
0	why , argot is horrible !
0	cosette , this paper will be found ; this is what i wish to say to thee , thou wilt see the figures , if i have the strength to recall them , listen well , this money is really thine
0	nothing was known about her , save that she was mad , and that in the world she passed for dead
0	he paid no heed to the portress 's words , but went to bed and to sleep
0	maskers abounded on the boulevard
0	what i can do , by the way , is to come in the afternoon , when night is beginning to fall
0	this attack , which was more furious than serious , irritated enjolras -- the fools !
0	he stood motionless , and did not relax his hold on montparnasse
0	one has assuredly the right , after all , to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse
0	i drink water -- i am overwhelmed with remorse and with creditors
0	he waited , in the hope of some incident , no matter of what nature , since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide
0	to escape him , but immediately suppressed it , and shaking montparnasse 's hand : -well , good evening , said he , i am going off to my elephant with my brats
0	i leave this very evening , aunt
0	there is will in thought , there is none in dreams
0	what was there to be seen there ?
0	all the female servants in his house were called nicolette ( even the magnon , of whom we shall hear more farther on )
0	then he set to work
0	there was no reply
0	not at all , said jehan wisely
0	the adorable young girl , whom marius , in his heart , called his ursule , approached her hastily
0	fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her : reflect , my beauty !
0	however , the peril was urgent , the last bounds of delay had been reached ; thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner
0	which do you prefer , descartes or spinoza ?
0	the man raised his eyes
0	we are but a poor country here
0	the love of a damned soul
0	two men who have been friends become two chance passers-by
0	how old is she ?
0	nature , as we have elsewhere said , looks before her
0	there was a celebrated fourier at the academy of science , whom posterity has forgotten ; and in some garret an obscure fourier , whom the future will recalllord byron was beginning to make his mark ; a note to a poem by millevoye introduced him to france in these terms : a certain lord baron
0	ask nicolette , who has not left you for a moment , if there was any possibility of having a woman here
0	thereupon he set out again on a run
0	the barricade will probably be blockaded , all the streets will be guarded , and you will not be able to get out
0	there is a divine right in louis xvi , there is because a bourbon in louis philippe ; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right , and , in order to clear away universal insurrection , they must be combated ; it must be done , france being always the one to begin
0	the carriage drove off
0	the recluse rushed upon her daughter with a roar of agony
0	to measure the great toe of the foot is to measure the giant
0	on the way thither , he encountered courfeyrac , and pretended not to see him
0	the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented ; a ray of vivid light , a ray of the true light of the living , suddenly penetrated within him
0	quasimodo , the object of the tumult , still stood on the threshold of the chapel , sombre and grave , and allowed them to admire him
0	only , the wounded man did not stir , and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse
0	he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds , who was coming there to live with his little daughter
0	meanwhile , enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his embrasure
0	the night promised to be as arid as the day had been
0	it was high time , for all the devotees were already licking their chops over the fine , flaming fagot
0	an assassin , because he assassinated police-agent javert
0	monsieur , said gringoire , i thank you !
0	the tone in which she pronounced these words made even henriet cousin shudder
0	the coachman humbly represented to monsieur l'inspecteur , that the utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the assassinated man , and with mire from the assassin
0	it is the liberty of architecture
0	there was nothing before them , nothing behind
0	nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother , who had also just fallen asleep
0	at last it reached the ground , the horrible cry arose , and the black beam , as it rebounded from the pavement , resembled a serpent leaping
0	only at a distance , at the summit of that one of the towers of notre-dame which commands the grève , two men outlined in black against the light morning sky , and who seemed to be looking on , were visible
0	as they advance themselves , they cause their satellites to progress also ; it is a whole solar system on the march
0	quasimodo who did not hear , saw the naked swords , the torches , the irons of the pikes , all that cavalry , at the head of which he recognized captain phoebus ; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts , the terror of some , the disturbance among the bravest of them , and from this unexpected succor he recovered so much strength , that he hurled from the church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery
0	death has a fashion of harassing victory , and she causes the pest to follow glory
0	said charmolue to pierrat
0	m gillenormand began to pace back and forth , his hands in his pockets , talking aloud , and twitching , with his irritated old fingers , at the two watches which he wore in his two fobs
0	they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death , and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows
0	at first sight one took her for a spectre ; at the second , for a statue
0	but how was she to get the letter to the post ?
0	on the contrary , he reassured her
0	magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves
0	jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent , a pile of fagots , and , behind the fagots , directly against the wall , a stone statue , whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom
0	the author of this book , who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself , has been absent from paris for many years
0	nevertheless , the grand hall was anything but olympus , and gringoire ’ s poor jupiter knew it better than any one else
0	at bottom , she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father ; but she loved her husband still more dearly
0	the bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people
0	i am examining the chiselling of these stones , and the manner in which yonder bas-relief is thrown out
0	so saying , she turned to the inspector again : -and yet , you see , mr
0	his candle was burning ; he was reading , with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window
0	the other did not perceive it
0	all at once , jondrette lifted up his voice : -by the way !
0	just see if those boobies will put themselves out !
0	this secret is worth massive gold
0	his massive couch , all covered with gilding , with great branches of lilies painted on the panels , thundered noisily along
0	he had allowed himself to be led , pushed , carried , lifted , bound , and bound again
0	the bearded man had on a fez , the other 's head was bare , and the snow had lodged in his hair
0	the passers-by stared at him in surprise , and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister
0	grouchy hoped for , blucher arriving
0	he counts for something with them ; they are what a philosopher would call , bespattered with the title , and that flatters them
0	hence phoebus believed poor similar to be dead , and that a month or two had elapsed since her death
0	one might as well seek the name of every cloud in the sky
0	fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name of the victim who passed by at the corner of the street , and it was the populace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare
0	thought gavroche , that name is a perfect farce
0	who was that child ?
0	why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons ?
0	jean valjean was hurt by this sadness , and heart-broken at this gentleness
0	it was high time ; one minute more , and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss
0	besides , observed a voice in one group , it is easy enough to talk about leaving
0	quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled
0	he called his species of work , for which he possessed special aptitude , shaving barbers
0	the obstacle was invincible
0	she dared make herself no promises , and she did not wish to refuse herself anything
0	a joyous ray of the rising sun entered through her window and touched her face
0	it is the country of jet
0	fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter ; how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing 's worth of millet every two days ; how to make a coverlet of one 's petticoat , and a petticoat of one 's coverlet ; how to save one 's candle , by taking one 's meals by the light of the opposite window
0	there is a revolt !
0	it strikes me , i say , that you heard the clatter of their wooden shoes fleeing southward , while you were fleeing northward
0	love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages
0	the case has been taken to the assizes at arras
0	he bristled up in hideous wise ; nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy ; their terrified air evokes terror
0	then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench , to m leblanc and his daughter , and went home
0	he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard , and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him
0	then he continued his ascent
0	sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on
0	what , -- all this was real !
0	that was the greatest of sacrifices , the most poignant of victories , the last step to take ; but it must be done
0	the steps of the patrol became more and more distinct
0	where , then , is the ship ?
0	then he raised his voice : -citizens !
0	the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long
0	if perpetual motion is impossible , can perpetual self-sacrifice be exacted ?
0	this sufficed him for his living
0	i have nothing to sell but cart-wheels
0	there are _voulgiers , cranequiniers_ and hand _couleveiniers_
0	she dropped her eyes , and he pursued his way
0	during thunder storms , he felt his pulse
0	all are bound to go out through the chimney
0	moreover , this is an offence which concerns me
0	the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned
0	the man recovered his animation as he ate
0	i tell you that you must try to learn for me what that wedding is , who that old cove belongs to , and where that wedding pair lives
0	it also frequently happened , that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar , and in that case , woe to the sewermen
0	let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated
0	what are your wrongs with regard to me ?
0	two gentlemen among these knaves !
0	louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century , and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little , and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful
0	all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age , which are decrepitude , decay , ruin , and sadness
0	that is , at least , what was supposed , whether rightly or not
0	one of them holds possession of the tuileries , one of them is giving philibert delorme a scar across the middle of his face ; and it is not , assuredly , one of the least of the scandals of our time to see with what effrontery the heavy architecture of this gentleman is being flattened over one of the most delicate façades of the renaissance !
0	hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of messire robert
0	come along , said courfeyrac
0	the cloud of spectators followed , jesting , in a paroxysm of delight
0	his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation
0	how do you know that it was the same fiacre ?
0	chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks
0	good brother claude , resumed jehan , emboldened by this smile , look at my worn out boots
0	the emperor , greatly pleased , shouted to him : you are a colonel , you are a baron , you are an officer of the legion of honor !
0	my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days , four persons and my spouse ill
0	there is one yonder , under the shed of the pillar-house , replied the man
0	the house was occupied , in fact
0	madame magloire , said he , fetch me a chair
0	we have all forgotten him completely
0	javert replied , his face incorruptible , and as melancholy as ever : -mr mayor , the truth is the truth
0	the criminal advocate , monsieur philippe lheulier , nevertheless , knows a little hebrew , which he learned in that matter of the jews of the rue kantersten , at brussels
0	when he had any one to dinner , madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table
0	he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger
0	here objections spring up afresh
0	i am bought by the government for to-day
0	we shall be at peace here for to-day ; but i will not answer for to-morrow
0	i am going to make a confession to you
0	you do not know that i am an old coward
0	he felt that he had been uprooted
0	to realize one 's dream
0	do these women think ?
0	she always occupied it alone because this gallery , being on the level of the first story , the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen , which was interdicted to the nuns
0	when he descended from the scaffold , there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass
0	they set off once more in the direction of the bastille
0	in this chamber , nothing was to be found of what furnishes ordinary apartments , neither benches , nor trestles , nor forms , nor common stools in the form of a chest , nor fine stools sustained by pillars and counter-pillars , at four sols a piece
0	now , we ask , which of the three arts has really represented human thought for the last three centuries ?
0	as you please , monseigneur
0	a battalion of the numberth light came at a run from saint-denis , the numberth of the line arrived from courbevoie , the batteries of the military school had taken up their position on the carrousel ; cannons were descending from vincennes
0	the insignificant testament , the last dotage of a decrepit grand art falling back into infancy before it dies
0	marius thought he had encountered a wag , the beginning of a mystification in the open street
0	sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy , and haughty condescension and malevolent looks
0	a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience
0	are you scoffing at me ?
0	this grating , made of stout , transverse bars , was about two feet square
0	poor jupiter , haggard , frightened , pale beneath his rouge , dropped his thunderbolt , took his cap in his hand ; then he bowed and trembled and stammered : his eminence -- the ambassadors -- madame marguerite of flanders --
0	he took her up and carried her again
0	his breathing was hoarse , his face livid , his limbs flaccid , his belly prominent
0	the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d'etat
0	alike in appearance , fundamentally different in reality ; the swiss defend the false , bonaparte defends the true
0	in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy , the egotism of priviliged authors , may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre , for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which new-comers are treated
0	there was logic in his nature , as there is in ours
0	he returned towards the marble table , and saw that the representation had been interrupted
0	he felt that , since such men were to die , their death ought to be a masterpiece
0	first it was the young vicomte de cormontreuil , who has his bell tower three leagues distant from reims ; then messire henri de triancourt , equerry to the king ; then less than that , chiart de beaulion , sergeant-at-arms ; then , still descending , guery aubergeon , carver to the king ; then , mace de frépus , barber to monsieur the dauphin ; then , thévenin le moine , king ’ s cook ; then , the men growing continually younger and less noble , she fell to guillaume racine , minstrel of the hurdy gurdy and to thierry de mer , lamplighter
0	i catch a glimpse , i do not contemplate !
0	the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne
0	that was the day of the galland indies
0	and behold , that terrible hand , the police , darts from the darkness , and abruptly tears off my mask !
0	one would have said that something dark was descending upon her
0	he sat there on the post of his door , motionless as a form of ice
0	i do not read , i spell out !
0	we have seen , of the flowers , and the swallows , the setting sun and the rising moon , and all sorts of important things
0	somewhat as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg , and with the most delicate impertinence
0	however , it is the same nowadays ; every wise man ’ s mouth complimenting another wise man is a vase of honeyed gall
0	every one took him for the judge , and with good reason
0	the gypsy walked slowly towards the door , without making any reply
0	he raised his eyes , and at the extremity of the vault , far , very far away in front of him , he perceived a light
0	when she passed the factory in working hours , when the workpeople were at the door , she affected to laugh and sing
0	his breakfast was served ; he seized the bread , took a mouthful , and then slowly replaced it on the table , and did not touch it again
0	the policemen trooped in in force , and in a few seconds javert 's order had been executed
0	jehan prepared himself for a rough shock , but the deaf man remained motionless ; only he had turned towards the scholar and was looking at him
0	make of it , soiling not , spoiling not , a petticoat fair with its bodice fine , which i will embroider and fill with flowers
0	why do you say , ah ?
0	if the decision has been to go barefoot , all go barefoot
0	she has not even trousers
0	the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs
0	progress is an honest man ; the ideal and the absolute do not filch pocket-handkerchiefs
0	in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron , ornamented above with two garlanded vases , and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf , which was a sort of episcopal luxury ; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper , with the silver worn off , fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen ; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand , loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes ; before the table an arm-chair of straw ; in front of the bed a prie-dieu , borrowed from the oratory
0	it was mother crucifixion
0	this bandit refused to defend himself
0	but he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold , because he could not afford a carriage , and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors
0	but , in the first place , what is power ?
0	the prisoner uttered not a syllable
0	if nature calls itself providence , society should call itself foresight
0	the real human division is this : the luminous and the shady
0	the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery
0	let us enter , nevertheless
0	this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans , his combinations , his scaffoldings , his projects for the future
0	conclusion : we remain , said laigle
0	as yet , nothing had come
0	to be a false signature in flesh and blood , to be a living false key , to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock , never more to look straightforward , to forever eye askance , to be infamous within the _i_ , no !
0	as he passed the door of the bell chamber , which was ajar , he saw something which struck him ; he beheld quasimodo , who , leaning through an opening of one of those slate penthouses which resemble enormous blinds , appeared also to be gazing at the place
0	marius had momentarily forgotten all this ; in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning , what he had done , where he had breakfasted , nor who had spoken to him ; he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought ; he only existed at the hours when he saw cosette
0	there is at least that much gained
0	they entered the carriage once more , and the coachman mounted his box
0	yes , sir , i am
0	and for the sake of obeying her father , she resumed her walks in the garden , generally alone , for , as we have mentioned , jean valjean , who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence , hardly ever went there
0	i said to myself hastily : here 's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out
0	cosette ventured to emerge from her hole
0	to paint with words , which contains figures one knows not how or why , is the primitive foundation of all human languages , what may be called their granite
0	the other end , which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of chelles , found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope , near the road to chelles , about a quarter of an hour from montfermeil
0	who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her ?
0	they were cruel and graceful ; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel
0	bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow
0	farewell all sap , all originality , all life , all intelligence
0	gavroche , completely carried away and radiant , had undertaken to get everything in readiness
0	it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed , which suddenly comes to a dead stop
0	do not get mad , come with us , let 's go drink a bottle of old wine together
0	at this abrupt query , the man started
0	at last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied , but which was triumphant , in reality
0	when you utter that name , unhappy girl , it is as though you crushed all the fibres of my heart between your teeth
0	you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready
0	an ancient burgundian coin
0	there are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot
0	he took the candlestick in his right hand ; holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread , he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room , occupied by the bishop , as we already know
0	maitre renard was less lucky ; all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r , and to call himself prenard ; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first
0	a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head , descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor , where it stopped
0	then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge ?
0	i know not , said fleur-de-lys ; it appears that a witch is to do penance this morning before the church , and thereafter to be hung
0	she had recognized the fact that all around her was wall , that below her there was a pavement covered with moisture and a truss of straw ; but neither lamp nor air-hole
0	the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden
0	you are an honest man , and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you
0	at certain hours , everything seems impossible , at others everything appears easy ; jean valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours
0	if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore , what is it in a cess-pool ?
0	at the same time , the priest flung jehan a purse , which gave the scholar a big bump on the forehead , and with which jehan retreated , both vexed and content , like a dog who had been stoned with marrow bones
0	he said , the faults of women , of children , of the feeble , the indigent , and the ignorant , are the fault of the husbands , the fathers , the masters , the strong , the rich , and the wise
0	marius ' two arms were passed round his neck , and the former 's feet dragged behind him
0	replied coppenole , tis not very difficult
0	they will give back cosette , for they have been paid ; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay
0	the old witch with a white moustache would not trust me
0	he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile , and he exclaimed , without , however , raising his tone : apropos of that quagmire , you are a hearty animal
0	a quarter of a league further on , he arrived at the bottom of alittle valley , where there is water which passes beneath an archmade through the embankment of the road
0	one word resembles a claw , another an extinguished and bleeding eye , such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab
0	est modus in rebus
0	joly deposited a kiss on mame hucheloup 's fat , red , wrinkled neck , and said to grantaire : my dear fellow , i have always regarded a woman 's neck as an infinitely delicate thing
0	these young folks are on the way to be married ; they are about to enter the serious part of life
0	before entering the restaurant room , the visitor read on the door the following line written there in chalk by courfeyrac : -- regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses
0	jean valjean resumed : what do you say to that ?
0	good virgin , have pity upon me
0	is not this second infinite , so to speak , subjacent to the first ?
0	and the grandfather says : that 's a simple matter
0	he looks and is on the verge of laughter ; he is on the verge of something else also
0	here thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door , and added with a shudder : -when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler !
0	her ailing brain comprehended nothing , but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her
0	there is an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell tower
0	here he has been pursuing me , threatening me , terrifying me for months !
0	the painter who says : my grinder , the notary who says : my skip-the-gutter , the hairdresser who says : my mealyback , the cobbler who says : my cub , talks slang
0	marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory
0	but i do not like the benches in the galleries
0	moreover , cosette was not very timid by nature
0	and so it goes on
0	all was stone around him ; before his eyes , gaping monsters ; below , quite at the bottom , in the place , the pavement ; above his head , quasimodo weeping
0	i may , perhaps , be in haste
0	in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck , he admitted the active principle , he admitted the passive principle , and he tried to reach a balance
0	i swear it to you by the angels of paradise
0	she wrote often , and this was noticed
0	sometimes at eventide , in the twilight , at an hour when the garden was deserted , he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel , in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival , and turned towards the spot where , as he knew , the sister was making reparation , prostrated in prayer
0	on its brow it bore the star , liberty
0	the living perceive the infinite ; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead
0	babylon has no ideal ; carthage has no ideal
0	now , get away with you
0	scepticism , that caries of the intelligence , had not left him a single whole idea
0	in the meantime , public minor had informed the archdeacon of the miraculous manner in which the gypsy had been saved
0	down with jupiter and the cardinal de bourbon !
0	we are going to fling the government to the earth
0	you are a wheelwright ?
0	at that moment fleur-de-lys noticed a little bag of embroidered leather suspended from the neck of the goat , -- what is that ?
0	the spanish convent was , above all others , the catholic convent
0	i kissed thy fresh round arms in haste
0	a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house
0	he lent an ear
0	you are small , said enjolras , you will not be seen
0	in questions of famine , riot , buzancais , for example , holds a true , pathetic , and just point of departure
0	beside the bed , three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out
0	the sun had set
0	it was the scholar , who , ill at ease , and greatly bored in his hiding-place , had succeeded in discovering there a stale crust and a triangle of mouldy cheese , and had set to devouring the whole without ceremony , by way of consolation and breakfast
0	quite recently , at villette , when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the saint-martin canal without interrupting navigation or emptying the canal , a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal , water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel , which was beyond the power of the pumping engines ; it was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin , and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped up
0	one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory
0	thought on any subject whatever , outside of the restricted circle of his functions , would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue ; thought on the day which had just passed was a torture
0	all that is the ceremony of dying
0	how do you know that i have not been an assassin ?
0	those cherubs are devils
0	how does he manage to be here , the old gambler ?
0	poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of france
0	monsieur le comte as big as my arm , assassins of september
0	he was the predestined constructor of the french group , succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe
0	he has villainous teeth , because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers , and handsome eyes because he has wit
0	she knew that hand , that arm , the sleeve of that coat
0	hold , this is what they put on this passport : jean valjean , discharged convict , native of ' -- that is nothing to you -- has been nineteen years in the galleys : five years for house-breaking and burglary ; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions
0	in the first case , the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys , in the second , a convict rose above the law , and set his foot upon it
0	the candle was on the chimney-piece , and gave but very little light
0	one fixed idea possesses me , and sears my brain like fire
0	are the canons defending themselves ?
0	m leblanc did not interrupt him , but said to him when he paused : -i do not know what you mean to say
0	twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement , through the whole length of the street
0	the first time that javert beheld m madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town , he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master 's clothes
0	he abounded in pleasantries , which were more peculiar than witty , says benjamin constant
0	twice a year , on the first of january and on st george 's day , marius wrote duty letters to his father , which were dictated by his aunt , and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula ; this was all that m gillenormand tolerated ; and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread
0	he passed those same places once more with drooping head , voiceless , tearless , almost breathless
0	there you will find m bossuet
0	besides , since our despair has this peculiarity , that it envelops others as well as ourselves , it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to die
0	jean valjean remained inert beneath javert 's grasp , like a lion submitting to the claws of a lynx
0	rot not like an unlettered ass , _quasi asinus illitteratus_ , on the straw seats of the school
0	judges , clerks , gendarmes , a throng of cruelly curious heads , all these he had already beheld once , in days gone by , twenty-seven years before ; he had encountered those fatal things once more ; there they were ; they moved ; they existed ; it was no longer an effort of his memory , a mirage of his thought ; they were real gendarmes and real judges , a real crowd , and real men of flesh and blood : it was all over ; he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him , with all that there is formidable in reality
0	almost at the same instant with the children , another couple approached the great basin
0	the irregular , the unforeseen , the disordered opening of chaos , the possible slip over a precipice -- this was the work of the lower regions , of rebels , of the wicked , of wretches
0	then she prostrates herself ; a great black veil is thrown over her , and the office for the dead is sung
0	this man did not belong in the country-side
0	as for the six hundred thousand francs , you do not mention them to me , but i forestall your thought , they are a deposit
0	on the chimney-piece , under a glass globe , stood a woman 's head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers
0	revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the parisian character , generosity , devotion , stormy gayety , students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence , the national guard invincible , bivouacs of shopkeepers , fortresses of street urchins , contempt of death on the part of passers-by
0	continuation of the crown which was changed into a dry leaf
0	under the rue saint-denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii
0	mahiette made no reply
0	javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner
0	that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence
0	go on , go on !
0	two boon companions came forth
0	monseigneur , he said , returning to the provost , which am i to take ?
0	gringoire flew thither , hoping to escape , by the swiftness of his legs , from the three infirm spectres who had clutched him
0	thenardier was the first to break the silence
0	they are coming to seize me
0	the same day on which robert d ’ estouteville took the place of jacques de villiers in the provostship of paris , master jehan dauvet replaced messire helye de thorrettes in the first presidency of the court of parliament , jehan jouvenel des ursins supplanted pierre de morvilliers in the office of chancellor of france , regnault des dormans ousted pierre puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king ’ s household
0	he paused , smote the table with his fist , and added , as he ground his teeth : -oh !
0	why did achilles and hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances ?
0	is it indeed true ?
0	listen , master pierre gringoire
0	who certainly , added gervaise , have teeth long enough to eat little children
0	a little rosebush which she had , had dried up , forgotten , in one corner
0	he protected her , and she strengthened him
0	be so good as to take a seat , monsieur
0	to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence !
0	i see your cabriolet pass my window
0	i do not wand to ged a gold
0	she was conquered , palpitating in his arms , and in his power
0	the house of the petit-picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated
0	like the nuns , the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor
0	people stood aside respectfully
0	it 's all right , he resumed , casting a glance at the beggar-girl , as she coiled up under the shawl , she 's got a famous peel
0	she put them into the tiny shoes , took them out , admired them , marvelled at them , looked at the light through them , was curious to see them try to walk on her bed , and would gladly have passed her life on her knees , putting on and taking off the shoes from those feet , as though they had been those of an infant jesus
0	therefore , she did not know what name to give to what she now felt
0	it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer
0	night had fully come
0	the hearse was still advancing
0	you ask why i speak ?
0	i believe that it is true , and i feel that it is true
0	but one must do something for the good god 's sake
0	with the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm of mont-saint-jean , and of vivian 's and vandeleur 's brigades , which flanked the left wing , wellington had no cavalry left
0	he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated
0	these symptoms of a violent moral preoccupation , had acquired an especially high degree of intensity at the epoch when this story takes place
0	this could only be the head of a column ; and of what column ?
0	your name has reached me in a confused manner , it is true , and very badly pronounced , i must admit ; but that signifies nothing : clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman , the people
0	marius continued : you are also jondrette the workman , fabantou the comedian , genflot the poet , don alvares the spaniard , and mistress balizard
0	we have spoken of this singular place in detail , but with respect , in so far , at least , as detail and respect are compatible
0	this is instructive at the same time
0	and then , thou shouldst have some cashmere shawls
0	a little peasant girl , all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle , was offering flowers to the travellers
0	to open it , to scale the frame , to bestride it , was the work of a second only
0	cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory ; marius perceived cosette on an altar
0	something of that sort
0	the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower , and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time
0	nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age
0	perhaps she is there among them !
0	ambition was at that time , in the direct acceptation of the word , a race to the steeple
0	he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair
0	jean valjean , in the thick cloud of the combat , did not appear to see marius ; the truth is , that he never took his eyes from the latter
0	he never said to himself : what if i were to go to such a place ?
0	i know what you mean
0	montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance ; the fact is , that these four men , with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other , had prowled all night long about la force , great as was their peril , in the hope of seeing thenardier make his appearance on the top of some wall
0	nevertheless , with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously , messire robert d ’ estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of january , number , in a very surly and peevish mood
0	it was little gavroche on his way to the wars
0	be happy , be in heaven , be the angel of an angel , exist in the sun , be content therewith , and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth ; you have before you , sir , a wretched man
0	venerate the man , whoever he may be , who has this sign -- the starry eye
0	well , mother hucheloup , we are avenging you
0	utopias travel about underground , in the pipes
0	but he did not know it
0	are not chains which are endless above human strength ?
0	an honorable man is gilles lecornu , brother of master jehan lecornu , provost of the king ’ s house , son of master mahiet lecornu , first porter of the bois de vincennes , -- all bourgeois of paris , all married , from father to son
0	moreover , all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars , even the attic windows in the roof
0	then i like it better too
0	in the meantime , a cloud had risen ; it had begun to rain
0	said she , you have a mirror !
0	with clenched fists , with arms outspread at right angles , like a man crucified who has been un-nailed , and flung face down on the earth
0	no one must see me , the whole point lies there , father fauchelevent
0	i think people are flinging stones at me , i flee without knowing whither , everything whirls and whirls
0	the son , regretting the swans , turned his head back toward the basin until a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him
0	poor survincent , the poacher , who had gone through the prison-cellar of the chatelet , said : it was the rhymes that kept me up
0	after leaving behind him the civic tournelle and the criminal tower , and skirted the great walls of the king ’ s garden , on that unpaved strand where the mud reached to his ankles , he reached the western point of the city , and considered for some time the islet of the passeur-aux-vaches , which has disappeared beneath the bronze horse of the pont neuf
0	what was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place !
0	and then she stared at him with a bewildered air
0	brevet , said the president , you have undergone an ignominious sentence , and you can not take an oath
0	the man seemed to have received an electric shock
0	what truth have you deduced , i will not say from medicine , which is too foolish a thing , but from astrology ?
0	that is precisely the idea of which i was in search
0	the spot was absolutely solitary
0	a tear swam in the eye of the bellringer , but did not fall
0	the insurgents , surprised but not terrified , had rallied
0	marius , dreamer as he was , was , as we have said , firm and energetic by nature
0	it is well , said jean valjean
0	this cavern knows no philosophers ; its dagger has never cut a pen
0	he was murdering , morally murdering , a wretched man
0	nevertheless , i am greatly in need of a chimney corner ; my shoes drink in the water , and all those cursed mills wept upon me !
0	have pity on me !
0	he took nearly four hours to go from hesdin to saint-pol ; four hours for five leagues
0	not the least in the world !
0	napoleon was an artillery officer , and felt the effects of this
0	some one , who was marius , had appeared to her in the light
0	i will take you to see frederick lemaitre
0	and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand
0	that day was composed of dawn , from one end to the otherall nature seemed to be having a holiday , and to be laughingthe flower-beds of saint-cloud perfumed the air ; the breath of the seine rustled the leaves vaguely ; the branches gesticulated in the wind , bees pillaged the jasmines ; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow , the clover , and the sterile oats ; in the august park of the king of france there was a pack of vagabonds , the birds
0	why have you stayed away so long ?
0	these were the mirages of that period
0	sometimes i pass whole hours in watching the sparks
0	this child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal
0	thought is moved in its most sombre depths , social philosophy is bidden to its most poignant meditations , in the presence of that enigmatic dialect at once so blighted and rebellious
0	it was thought that he must , in the past , have lived a country life , since he knew all sorts of useful secrets , which he taught to the peasants
0	the passer-by said to the inhabitant : -- you see what i have on my back , i must get out , you have the key , give it to me
0	it was grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary
0	marius approached as near as he could , pretending to be busy reading a book , but he halted afar off , then returned and seated himself on his bench , where he spent four hours in watching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk , and who produced on him the impression that they were making sport of him
0	however , that 's not to the purpose
0	all his good qualities had a defect
0	the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea , and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else
0	i have that general on my back , and i am carrying him through the grape-shot
0	this door with an unclean , and this window with an honest though dilapidated air , thus beheld on the same house , produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side , with different miens beneath the same rags , the one having always been a mendicant , and the other having once been a gentleman
0	he strolled out beyond the salpetriere into deserted regions ; that is where windfalls are to be found ; where there is no one , one always finds something
0	the boat , abandoned to itself , floated for several minutes with the stream
0	i have travelled twelve leagues
0	it 's stupid to let old people stray off like that
0	mademoiselle , said he , with his cool gravity , i have here a package which belongs to you , i think
0	he could not breathe , he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its throbbing
0	on arriving at the upper story , she set her lamp on a coffer , and , phoebus , like a frequent visitor of the house , opened a door which opened on a dark hole
0	she concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig
0	javert 's two acolytes were marching in their ranks
0	the wretched , blackguard assassins !
0	let us begin at the beginning
0	the prioress , who was telling her beads , raised her eyes and said : -ah !
0	these men patiently pursue these bourgeois
0	in the days which followed the finding of this treasure , he only displayed himself at the luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart
0	my name is euphrasie
0	they are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended champmathieu
0	the language of a master , and the reasoning of an innkeeper , neither of which admitted of any reply
0	it was by one of these wretches , a spanish straggler who spoke french , that the marquis of fervacques , deceived by his picard jargon , and taking him for one of our own men , was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle-field itself , in the course of the night which followed the victory of cerisoles
0	then , with indescribable terror , he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand , and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish can swim
0	bouvines and fontenoy were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day , austerlitz having become antiquated
0	and then , it was touching to behold this protection which had fallen from a being so hideous upon a being so unhappy , a creature condemned to death saved by quasimodo
0	signé stands in the text
0	all four were dressed in parti-colored robes of yellow and white , which were distinguished from each other only by the nature of the stuff ; the first was of gold and silver brocade ; the second , of silk ; the third , of wool ; the fourth , of linen
0	the gypsy had just drawn from the bag a little shoe absolutely similar to the other
0	to which of the two do you object ?
0	he was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which mademoiselle gillenormand modestly absented herself
0	he still owes me the money for my epithalamium , and he came within a nick of hanging me this evening , which would have been very inconvenient to me -- he is niggardly towards men of merit
0	this man is habitually engaged in digging a hole
0	an insurrection which breaks out , is an idea which is passing its examination before the people
0	let us interrupt the romance , said he
0	it was evident that a great event had happened in gavroche 's life
0	we shall be this evening in the rue de l'homme arme , no
0	on emerging from the bastille , gringoire descended the rue saint-antoine with the swiftness of a runaway horse
0	my greatness [ grandeur ] does not reach as far as that shelf
0	monasteries , when they abound in a nation , are clogs in its circulation , cumbrous establishments , centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist
0	for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers ; but if the man was not jean valjean , and if this man was not a good , honest old fellow living on his income , he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds , some chief of a dangerous band , who gave alms to conceal his other talents , which was an old dodge
0	on a table lay a pen , a leaden inkstand and paper , provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the night patrols
0	when the eye sees black , the heart sees trouble
0	where is monsieur le maire going ?
0	how all-sufficient one finds it !
0	in the middle of another conversation , he chanced to exclaim : -oh !
0	the soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven
0	he was at friedland
0	a handful of dirt , a breath , and behold adam
0	any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him , and who had examined him attentively at the moment , would have shuddered
0	are you going to drink those two bottles ?
0	if you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is , call it progress ; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress , call it to-morrow
0	any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at this epoch , and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge , which will soon be succeeded , let us hope , by some hideous iron cable bridge , might have observed , had he dropped his eyes over the parapet , a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap , and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth , to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon , was sewn , shod with wooden sabots , tanned by the sun , his face nearly black and his hair nearly white , a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek , bowed , bent , prematurely aged , who walked nearly every day , hoe and sickle in hand , in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge , and border the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces , charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say , were they much larger : these are gardens , and were they a little smaller : these are bouquets
0	the reader knows the rest
0	it is out of pity that you do not turn away your eyes
0	they had been up since five o'clock that morning , as the reader will remember ; but bah !
0	i was nailed , rooted to the spot
0	at the third , he cried , famous !
0	while she was asleep !
0	you shall dine like charles the tenth ; all is going well !
0	chenildieu was brought in , a prisoner for life , as was indicated by his red cassock and his green cap
0	i prefer louis xviii
0	the truth is , that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied
0	it was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid
0	he remained there for a fortnight , preaching , administering the sacrament , teaching , exhorting
0	he had said : i shall return in three days
0	she preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw , with its long white strings , in her hand rather than on her head
0	in the centre of the lofty gothic façade of the palace , the grand staircase , incessantly ascended and descended by a double current , which , after parting on the intermediate landing-place , flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes , -- the grand staircase , i say , trickled incessantly into the place , like a cascade into a lake
0	the trace left in him by the revolution was prodigious
0	no , no , said he ; the owl enters not the nest of the lark
0	one would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously
0	what an ill-favored soul !
0	m madeleine had retained his seat near the fire , pen in hand , his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating , and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations
0	all this was accomplished without haste , with that strange and threatening gravity which precedes engagements
0	i should not be so if , through my fault , you had continued to esteem me ; now that you despise me , i am so
0	air : vive henri iv
0	very good , said cosette
0	off he goes , and i drag you out of the hole
0	was he her grandfather ?
0	this had filled him with jealousy , and he had done all he could , on every occasion , to injure madeleine
0	she interrupted with a terrible and thrilling laugh
0	on drawing near , he perceived that it was nothing else than a wretched legless cripple in a bowl , who was hopping along on his two hands like a wounded field-spider which has but two legs left
0	we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ !
0	he paid no attention to a tolerably numerous rabble which had assembled in the place du parvis , before the portal of notre-dame ; he remembered that it was the month of may ; he supposed that it was some procession , some pentecost , some festival , hitched his horse to the ring at the door , and gayly ascended the stairs to his beautiful betrothed
0	the rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable
0	and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future
0	this means kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed
0	your little one is still asleep
0	boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this
0	not to amount to anything
0	each time that sister simplice asked her how she felt , she replied invariably , well
0	what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine ?
0	in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered , when the wind had shaken the trees , they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly
0	tis a sorceress who has stabbed a captain
0	j'etais mendiant et toi charitable
0	there they drank , there they ate , there they shouted ; they did not pay much , they paid badly , they did not pay at all , but they were always welcome
0	if i speak , it is because i have proofs
0	lord , give her back to me
0	suddenly , at the moment when the superintendent ’ s assistants were preparing to execute charmolue ’ s phlegmatic order , he threw his leg over the balustrade of the gallery , seized the rope with his feet , his knees and his hands ; then he was seen to glide down the façade , as a drop of rain slips down a window-pane , rush to the two executioners with the swiftness of a cat which has fallen from a roof , knock them down with two enormous fists , pick up the gypsy with one hand , as a child would her doll , and dash back into the church with a single bound , lifting the young girl above his head and crying in a formidable voice , --
0	twelve officers of the fraternity of fools raised him on their shoulders ; and a sort of bitter and disdainful joy lighted up the morose face of the cyclops , when he beheld beneath his deformed feet all those heads of handsome , straight , well-made men
0	this made both of them laugh the whole evening
0	in that lay my stupidity
0	it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law
0	gringoire , thoroughly stunned by his fall , remained on the pavement in front of the holy virgin at the street corner
0	objected gringoire ; i shall break my neck
0	his companion followed him , and the poor goat ran after them all , bleating plaintively
0	she cried angrily ; and drawing herself up , with her hair all dishevelled : mercy !
0	silence then , capital r !
0	there were some people and many soldiers in the place
0	in neither case did the honor of the magistracy sustain any injury ; for it is far better that a judge should be reputed imbecile or profound than deaf
0	with that malady of progress , civil war , we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage
0	jean valjean , in bewilderment , strained her wildly to his breast
0	he was , as the reader will remember , one of those antique old men who await death perfectly erect , whom age bears down without bending , and whom even sorrow can not curve
0	we already had you in our power , when that miserable officer came up
0	the police know it also , and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere
0	the wanton and vigorous vegetation quivered , full of strength and intoxication , around these two innocents , and they uttered words of love which set the trees to trembling
0	he went on , muttering between his teeth , and not addressing marius so much as his cravat : -patron-minette must have had a hand in this
0	to be strong-minded is an important item
0	the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought
0	people thought much of looking well
0	her eyes were hollow and staring
0	nothing was lacking in the capture by assault of the hucheloup wine-shop ; neither paving-stones raining from the windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers by crushing them horribly , nor shots fired from the attic-windows and the cellar , nor the fury of attack , nor , finally , when the door yielded , the frenzied madness of extermination
0	the eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely
0	you have come to ask something of me , you say ?
0	m gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter , that tall mademoiselle , who was over forty and looked fifty , and by a handsome little boy of seven years , white , rosy , fresh , with happy and trusting eyes , who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him : how handsome he is !
0	on feeling her touch him , quasimodo trembled in every limb
0	taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds , it is sixty fathoms long , and its diameter at its base is three feet
0	my choice is made
0	to be present at executions constitutes a duty
0	at that moment a cry arose among the thieves : la esmeralda !
0	you have not replaced her
0	meanwhile , architecture is tormented in her struggles to conceal this nudity
0	will you contest results like this ?
0	what marius now beheld was a hovel
0	here questions exfoliated , so to speak , into innumerable enigmas , abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses , and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy
0	the sergeant lowered his bayonet
0	he said to himself , and sprang to his feet , quivering from head to foot
0	nevertheless , i should have preferred not to have had this occur
0	he remained there until daylight , in the same attitude , bent double over that bed , prostrate beneath the enormity of fate , crushed , perchance , alas !
0	i put the rags in a basket , the cores and stalks in a bucket , the linen in my cupboard , the woollen stuff in my commode , the old papers in the corner of the window , the things that are good to eat in my bowl , the bits of glass in my fireplace , the old shoes behind my door , and the bones under my bed
0	well , exclaimed cosette , father , i knew that you were peculiar , but i never should have expected this
0	nothing more simple in those days than a suit of sorcery instituted against an animal
0	these words were , so to speak , the point of union of two scenes , which had , up to that time , been developed in parallel lines at the same moment , each on its particular theatre ; one , that which the reader has just perused , in the rat-hole ; the other , which he is about to read , on the ladder of the pillory
0	as for jean valjean , he was , indeed , all tenderness , all solicitude ; but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all
0	who shall resuscitate it ?
0	there can be no one !
0	one would say that it were conscious of the vicinity of the heavy romanesque pillars
0	there he entered a cabriolet , which took him to the esplanade of the observatoire
0	it was a hymn which issued from the gloom , a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night ; women 's voices , but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children , -- voices which are not of the earth , and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears , and which the dying man hears already
0	there was still another chair in the detached alcove , but the straw was half gone from it , and it had but three legs , so that it was of service only when propped against the wall
0	she had lost her shame ; she lost her coquetry
0	one would have said , to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance , that he had already , in some previous state of existence , traversed the revolutionary apocalypse
0	i am telling you how things stand
0	i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity , -- jondrette
0	then he began to read them promptly , one after the other , made a sign to master olivier who appeared to exercise the office of minister , to take a pen , and without communicating to him the contents of the despatches , he began to dictate in a low voice , the replies which the latter wrote , on his knees , in an inconvenient attitude before the table
0	around what capital have you seen foliage more tender and better caressed by the chisel
0	it was the antechamber of the galleys
0	it seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads
0	he had reached an elbow of the sewer , and , arriving at the turn with head bent down , he had struck the wall
0	let us try to say it
0	enjolras turned to jean valjean
0	shouted courfeyrac , let us not waste our powder
0	a pontifical and warlike nature , a singular thing in a youth
0	while thus bent over , she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the spring
0	the man replied : -the grave-digger
0	the bishop confined himself to the remark : -i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed
0	as marius was withdrawing , after concluding his inspection , he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness
0	there was neither shame nor redness on his face
0	good , said gringoire , without a horse , no man
0	the prosecution is all ready ; twill soon be finished , i assure you !
0	marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps ; at the moment when he was about to re-enter his cell , he caught sight of the elder jondrette girl following him through the corridor
0	thunder , if i understand you !
0	of what man are you speaking ?
0	they sometimes meet , and fraternize there
0	one there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair , the rafters of roofs , bits of garret windows with their figured paper , window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon , wrecks of chimneys , cupboards , tables , benches , howling topsyturveydom , and those thousand poverty-stricken things , the very refuse of the mendicant , which contain at the same time fury and nothingness
0	jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg , as he did not wish to do anything out of the way , and as , above all things , he feared to arouse cosette ; but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers , while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius , who perceived nothing else now , and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face , jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes
0	i lodge on the entresol
0	then she began to laugh again , and added : -do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today ?
0	let us shoot him down on the spot
0	by the way , said jondrette , have you been eating here ?
0	nevertheless , walls could be confusedly made out , which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond , and the low roofs of the rue polonceau
0	that said , we beg the reader to take note of it , and we continue
0	that is well , i go
0	he was in one of those streets and one of those houses
0	what is the bailiff ’ s feudal jurisdiction ?
0	towards one o ’ clock in the morning , the guests began to take their leave
0	the yellow dwarf was transferred into mirror
0	a sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and sophisms , in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness , while communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines
0	grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table
0	in this manner he skirted mount sainte-geneviève , and finally emerged from the town by the porte saint-victor
0	this well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself
0	coppenole , with his tranquil and rustic countenance , made the king approach the window
0	he did not perceive that , along with genius , and pell-mell , he was admitting force , that is to say , that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry , on the one hand that which is divine , on the other that which is brutal
0	to teach reading , means to light the fire ; every syllable spelled out sparkles
0	exclaimed jehan , that can only be my friend , captain phoebus !
0	yes , said the provincial , at reims
0	they lived in this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul
0	they shut themselves up at home
0	these twenty-five millions , employed in assistance and enjoyment , would double the splendor of paris
0	ancient and time-honored manoeuvre which eve understood from the very first day of the world , and which every woman understands from the very first day of her life !
0	a metaphysical school of the north , impregnated to some extent with fog , has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word force with the word will
0	then , thrusting her under lip out beyond the upper , she made a little pout , which appeared to be familiar to her , executed a pirouette on her heel , and set about collecting in her tambourine the gifts of the multitude
0	as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind , the child made comparisons and adored him
0	to cling fast to it , or to let go his hold ?
0	nevertheless , he advanced as rapidly as possible
0	she shut herself up , which her rule allowed her to do , and hid herself , every time that she desired to contemplate it
0	another spread out over his coat the cross-belt and cartridge-box of a national guardsman , the cover of the cartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted : public order
0	a damned soul , who , in the midst of the furnace , should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna , would experience what jean valjean felt
0	he had been lost among the group of insurgents
0	that is not too much
0	he wrote : -- french republic
0	those take-downs are disagreeable
0	my name is madame thenardier , said the mother of the two little girls
0	the sacked nun again pressed her daughter in her arms
0	it is not enough to see her ; it is necessary that you should live for her
0	is this his house ?
0	this was wild and very fine
0	jean valjean himself opened the package ; it was a bundle of bank-notes
0	after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken , and had given this formula of their common soul , there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry , funereal in sense and triumphant in tone : long live death !
0	some philosophers -- voltaire among the number -- affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory
0	precisely at that moment , the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose ; he stopped short , holding his nose in his handkerchief , and gazing over it at cosette
0	by the way , are not they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of m le duc de berry ?
0	besides , what the cloister knows the world learns not
0	it is not for my sake , nor for mademoiselle 's
0	her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles , her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle ; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff , a linen gown , and coarse shoes
0	in three or four weeks , marius had devoured this bliss
0	road-mender and thief as he was , he cherished one dream ; he believed in the treasures buried in the forest of montfermeil
0	they seemed to take no heed of her presence , and talked of her aloud , to her face , as of something unclean , abject , and yet , at the same time , passably pretty
0	a pretty girl does not cure a man of fever
0	quasimodo could not , unfortunately , hear these words uttered with a sort of sombre and savage majesty
0	on examining the coat , it was found that one skirt had been torn in a singular way
0	a few uneasy bourgeois , who were rapidly returning home , hardly saw him
0	unless it 's the old fellow
0	nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam , which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows , and which is composed of all the innocence of the present , and of all the passion of the future
0	the thenardier had no reply to make
0	my infant jesus has been taken from me , has been stolen from me ; they devoured her on a heath , they drank her blood , they cracked her bones !
0	the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark ; later on , mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there , as in a dark chamber
0	this quarter of an acre , so poorly planted , so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds , was dear to him , and satisfied his wants
0	they are pollux , patrocles , nisus , eudamidas , ephestion , pechmeja
0	just as they were finishing their morsel of bread , and had reached the angle of that gloomy rue des ballets , at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of la force was visible : -hullo , is that you , gavroche ?
0	he was in his alleys from the break of day , in summer , planting , cutting , hoeing , watering , walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness , sadness , and sweetness , sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours , listening to the song of a bird in the trees , the babble of a child in a house , or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass , of which the sun made a carbuncle
0	at that moment he beheld the crowd give way
0	ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce
0	they give themselves a scar with the address of thou as citizens , in order to get themselves called , eventually , monsieur le comte
0	she approached the opening , and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the wall , in a sad and resigned attitude
0	this cavern has for its object the destruction of everything
0	a young girl , fantastically dressed , emerged from the throng
0	they caused that revolution , at first so remarkable for its unanimity , to degenerate into a quarrel
0	wherever there is a community , there is a commune ; where there is a commune , there is right
0	you want me to swear ?
0	the larger the diocese of the patron , the fatter the curacy for the favorite
0	give them light that they may warm you
0	he took the paper , unfolded it , and read these words written in large characters , with a pencil : -jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet ; there was no one on the slope ; he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child , not so large as a man , clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust-colored cotton velvet , who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the champde-mars
0	at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook , and returned to the prefecture of police , as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been
0	for a clever man like fauchelevent , this allusion was an awkward one
0	the hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its mantle and descended upon the arm of phoebus with the grip of an eagle ’ s talon ; at the same time the shadow spoke , --
0	the sanguine light of the furnace illuminated in the chamber only a confused mass of horrible things
0	-- here are the fixed terms : action or reaction , revolution or counter-revolution
0	and what if he does not give in ?
0	there was a miller ’ s wife there who was nursing a fine child ; it was not far from the university , and claude carried the little jehan to her in his own arms
0	history of a leavened cake of maize
0	gribier gazed at him in stupefaction
0	in number , the little convent had disappeared , the school had disappeared
0	he had thus propounded the problem of his life : to toil as little as possible at material labor , in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable ; in other words , to bestow a few hours on real life , and to cast the rest to the infinite
0	i am forced to do so , since the real jean valjean has been found
0	five hundred and eighty-four !
0	he did not hesitate , but took the one on the right
0	it was like water on dry soil ; no matter how much money he received , he never had any
0	so much the worse for enjolras !
0	do not tell him that it is i
0	tis an evil thing , and the confusion of it displeases me
0	at the end of a few moments his foot came in contact with an obstacle ; he stumbled and fell
0	there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive
0	this holy woman , too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order , which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary , had piously put it on a little manikin , which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death
0	jehan had then concealed himself behind a stone king , not daring to breathe , and fixing upon the monstrous hunchback a frightened gaze , like the man , who , when courting the wife of the guardian of a menagerie , went one evening to a love rendezvous , mistook the wall which he was to climb , and suddenly found himself face to face with a white bear
0	quasimodo picked up his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers , in order to get a nearer view , and to spy out a means of defence
0	at that point of the file there was a carriage-load of maskers
0	you will say to me : what !
0	that force of sex and blood which , in the madness of youth , i had imagined that i had stifled forever had , more than once , convulsively raised the chain of iron vows which bind me , a miserable wretch , to the cold stones of the altar
0	she uttered a feeble cry
0	enjolras , the man-principle , had over his co-religionists that sort of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute
0	then she shook herself and shrieked in a loud and heartrending voice : no !
0	he came across doors , but they were closed
0	then we went to the quartier des invalides , where there was a railing on a garden , the rue plumet
0	the old woman addressed him as monseigneur , and shut up the crown in a drawer
0	no doubt your toilet is a little extravagant and wild , but what difference does that make with such a charming damsel as yourself ?
0	the trunk of a tree is immovable ; the foliage is capricious
0	that is different , said the bourgeois
0	at that word , jean valjean became wild
0	eight feet above the floor , a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side ; from this beam hung , at short distances apart , chains three feet long , and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck
0	after breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour ; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw , pen in hand and their paper on their knees , and the emperor dictated to them the order of battle
0	he first cast around a slow glance of hatred upon the crowd
0	no , said the bishop ; keep your money
0	i do not care a hang for old fellows , that i do not !
0	utopias travel about underground , in the pipes
0	he will return to it
0	he was thrust onward , he was drawn , and he could not stir
0	as for his prowess at waterloo , the reader is already acquainted with that
0	the mother obeyed , and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets
0	do not let 's speak to him
0	what did they do in madame de t s salon ?
0	and if , as he grew older , abysses had formed in his science , they had also formed in his heart
0	this act of violence had roused her from her revery
0	when they had passed the barrier , the coachman tried to enter into conversation , but the traveller only replied in monosyllables
0	m leblanc let them take their own course
0	who is this rogue ?
0	the sweet , feeble being , who should not have understood anything of this world or of god , incessantly punished , scolded , ill-used , beaten , and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself , who lived in a ray of dawn !
0	then the archdeacon rose to his feet , and ran without halting , towards notre-dame , whose enormous towers he beheld rising above the houses through the gloom
0	under the empire , between two wars , he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand
0	this was the very month when the thenardiers , after having demanded twelve francs instead of six , had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve
0	the prioress , seated on the only chair in the parlor , was waiting for fauchelevent
0	between the attack of the past and the attack of the future , the establishment of july struggled
0	it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free , was it not ?
0	this vessel , battered as it was , -- for the sea had handled it roughly , -- produced a fine effect as it entered the roads
0	the gamin examined the rope , the flue , the wall , the windows , and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies : -is that all !
0	a funeral passes by
0	and the regiments , accustomed to the fiercest visions of war , gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of redoubt , a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain by its enormous size
0	it must be done
0	the prioress is elected for three years by the mothers , who are called meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter
0	then give me a drink , said javert
0	there is one word which crops up in every language of the continent , with a sort of mysterious power and authority
0	marius followed the rue saint-honore
0	after all , the young scapegrace had a good heart , as can be seen in all comedies
0	this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses ; and a senator of the empire , a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the number brumaire , and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d -- -- , wrote to m bigot de preameneu , the minister of public worship , a very angry and confidential note on the subject , from which we extract these authentic lines : - expenses of carriage ?
0	and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about
0	sixthly : the prisoners called barkers , who summon the other prisoners to the parlor , force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly
0	moreover , these few weeks had been a flash of lightning ; there had been no time for anything except love
0	nothing answers ; that man is terrible
0	it is certain , that nothing less than the intervention of jupiter was required to save the four unfortunate sergeants of the bailiff of the courts
0	the tiniest hole saves them
0	all about an immense plain , patched with a thousand sorts of cultivated plots , sown with fine villages
0	but a city like paris is perpetually growing
0	finally , marius opened the fourth letter
0	it contained marius ' hundred cards
0	listen then , my dear similar ; i adore you passionately
0	she bent down and discovered cosette cowering at the other end of the table , almost under the drinkers ' feet
0	these souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic
0	sire , i had nothing to do with it
0	he had nosed about the law , but did not practise it
0	it was napoleon , the immense somnambulist of this dream which had crumbled , essaying once more to advance
0	everything lies in that
0	the undertaker 's men come and get it , and whip up , coachman !
0	the child ( aged six )
0	but the little rascals had better legs than he ; when he arrived , they had stripped the table
0	we , who do not believe what these women believe , but who , like them , live by faith , -- we have never been able to think without a sort of tender and religious terror , without a sort of pity , that is full of envy , of those devoted , trembling and trusting creatures , of these humble and august souls , who dare to dwell on the very brink of the mystery , waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is not yet open , turned towards the light which one can not see , possessing the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is , aspiring towards the gulf , and the unknown , their eyes fixed motionless on the darkness , kneeling , bewildered , stupefied , shuddering , half lifted , at times , by the deep breaths of eternity
0	all were the direct sons of the french revolution
0	they shouted : -- there 's another of those saint-simonians !
0	the vocal mothers added : he is a brother of father fauvent
0	this deep silence , this deep grief , this profound oblivion in which everything had disappeared except one thing , produced upon them the effect of the grand altar at christmas or easter
0	lieutenant theodule gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer
0	what do you mean ?
0	jean valjean at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval
0	nevertheless , this shock had , so to speak , awakened the recluse
0	the day was declining , there was not even a cat in the lane , the hour was propitious
0	she asked of the gypsy
0	the reader will not be surprised if , for various reasons , we do not here treat in a thorough manner , from the theoretical point of view , the questions raised by socialism
0	the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep
0	she pulled her chemise up on her shoulders , made a low bow to marius , then a familiar sign with her hand , and went towards the door , saying : -good morning , sir
0	he affirmed that m fauchelevent had done well to retire early , if he were suffering , but that it was only a slight ailment
0	the maritime tribunal condemned him , for this crime , to a prolongation of his term for three years , which made eight years
0	i received him , i reared him , i nourished him , i loved him , i idolized him , and i have slain him !
0	is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create the rose ?
0	peter the slaughterer ; and baptist crack-gosling
0	and so on , according to the hour
0	i suspected as much , said the soldier
0	there is something indescribable there which exhales grace , a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines , from which flutter rags drying in the wind , and an old market-gardener 's house , built in the time of louis xiii , with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows , dilapidated palisades , a little water amid poplar-trees , women , voices , laughter ; on the horizon the pantheon , the pole of the deaf-mutes , the val-de-grace , black , squat , fantastic , amusing , magnificent , and in the background , the severe square crests of the towers of notre dame
0	and what did he offer ?
0	and , five minutes afterward , the whole table from one end to the other , was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness
0	gringoire returned the caresses
0	must he then stop there ?
0	at the age of twenty-two , on a beautiful spring morning , she quitted paris , bearing her child on her back
0	for the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens
0	it is proper and grayish ; laid out by rule and line ; one might almost say as though it came out of a bandbox
0	tis the gypsy with the goat
0	your twenty leagues all at a full trot , and in less than eight hours
0	there stood on the great square in corinth a statue carved by silanion and catalogued by pliny ; this statue represented episthates
0	jean valjean had never loved anything ; for twenty-five years he had been alone in the world
0	they rally the grand meg and the grand dab
0	i dare not look at you
0	he put in his pocket the pistols which javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the numberd of february , and which had remained in his hands
0	you are making sport of me !
0	they are so stupid that it would pass ; he merrily called everything by its name , whether decent or indecent , and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies
0	we shall see later on how much truth there was in this
0	no , you do not know it ; you were too small !
0	there was an unknown quantity about thenardier ; hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman
0	with the exception of the two or three streets , of which we shall presently speak , all was wall and solitude there
0	the coachman turned to the inside travellers
0	the body of bernard guidonis , born in france near roche-abeille , was , as he had ordered , and in spite of the king of castile , borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges , although bernard guidonis was bishop of tuy in spain
0	she approached the victim with her light step
0	he was merely a kinsman ; another fauchelevent was her real father
0	a royal ordinance erected angouleme into a naval school ; for the duc d'angouleme , being lord high admiral , it was evident that the city of angouleme had all the qualities of a seaport ; otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a woundin the council of ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes representing slack-rope performances , which adorned franconi 's advertising posters , and which attracted throngs of street urchins , should be tolerated
0	terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality
0	that is different ; i did not know that
0	and what are you going to do with it ?
0	one day a sister , on seeing her pass , said to another sister , she passes for a dead woman
0	not one of the young recluses could see him , because of the serge curtain , but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice , which they had come to know and to distinguish
0	it was an impotent man , both halt and crippled , and halt and crippled to such a degree that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which sustained him , gave him the air of a mason ’ s scaffolding on the march
0	i tell you that the affair ca not go wrong , resumed the long-haired man
0	there was in the intonation of that oh !
0	this cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe
0	what would all that eternal festival be without this seasoning ?
0	the government paid them a small pension , the ladies of the petit-picpus received them cordially
0	as he spoke thus , the young scamp stealthily adjusted his crossbow
0	a new life gradually took possession of cosette : the relations which marriage creates , visits , the care of the house , pleasures , great matters
0	a profound and unique formation
0	it was a frightful hole , but she felt free
0	but , thank heaven , still another choice is possible
0	a strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere
0	if that is the way you jest at the courthouse , messieurs the lawyers , i sincerely compliment you
0	nevertheless , that cloud cleared away for a moment , at the passage of a mule which traversed the crowd , bearing a priest
0	but you have time
0	gavroche wheeled round haughtily , and answered : -if you are killed before me , i shall take yours
0	to abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one 's happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves
0	a linden-tree showed its crest above the niche , and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the rue polonceau
0	sir , replied basque , i do , precisely
0	he asked himself severely what he had meant by this , my object is attained !
0	thereupon a eulogy of the marvellous fish , with a thousand delicate allusions to the young betrothed of marguerite of flanders , then sadly cloistered in at amboise , and without a suspicion that labor and clergy , nobility and merchandise had just made the circuit of the world in his behalf
0	there was water on the surface , slime at the bottom
0	what o ’ clock is it ?
0	this is one of the forms of supreme happiness
0	they took my child from me ; they stole my child ; they ate my child
0	under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by very characteristic notes
0	to be left-handed renders you very enviable
0	as he could not lift the jug , he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth , and swallowed a draught
0	ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner
0	his brain was dazzled and obliterated
0	but no view of the outside was to be had
0	each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp
0	he returned home on foot at midnight , in a driving rain-storm
0	here is the gypsy !
0	pagan mythology was giving battle to christian mythology
0	hum , said the archdeacon ; those are names as fit for a good work as a catapult for the chief altar
0	to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism
0	he measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his having a suspicion of the fact ; he recalled his fears of the preceding summer , so foolishly dissipated ; he recognized the precipice , it was still the same ; only , jean valjean was no longer on the brink , he was at the bottom of it
0	in all , five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs
0	the wind and rain redoubled , the roof was slippery
0	these vehicles , which have no counterparts nowadays , had something distorted and hunchbacked about them ; and when one saw them passing in the distance , and climbing up some road to the horizon , they resembled the insects which are called , i think , termites , and which , though with but little corselet , drag a great train behind them
0	it was to bossuet that he sent navet
0	she smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand , and smiled into the mirror , humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice : -- nos amours ont dure toute une semaine , [ number ] mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts !
0	you say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature 's child !
0	all this , it is true , detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg
0	fantine did not murmur ; she feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring , and she began to talk of indifferent things
0	tis thus that the marvellous art of the middle ages has been treated in nearly every country , especially in france
0	one gives way to vivacity ; and then , when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it !
0	g -- -- , calm , his body almost upright , his voice vibrating , was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist
0	since when have the haudriette widows taken to having babes in swaddling-clothes ?
0	it was a vast and badly lighted apartment , now full of uproar , now full of silence , where all the apparatus of a criminal case , with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng , was in process of development
0	revolt , thirty years ago , was regarded from still other points of view
0	as for the scholars , they swore
0	i certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor , on the right
0	he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent
0	heart-rending distress ; marius bore a passion in his heart , and night over his eyes
0	then the clerk began to write ; then he handed a long parch-ment to the president
0	chapter v the key to the red door
0	was it possible that napoleon should have won that battle ?
0	he was this same brigand of the loire
0	i think the job 's a good one
0	i know that ; i am a goldsmith
0	it was barred off , beginning with the rue du pare-royal
0	what 's the use of being twenty years old ?
0	all this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation , to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea
0	sire , it is a repellent which will save you
0	a shout of laughter from all the students greeted the unlucky name of the poor furrier of the king ’ s robes
0	but that which attracted the eye most of all , and fixed it for a long time on that point , was the abbey itself
0	the barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack
0	cosette pronounced these gardens hideous : for the first timein her life , she found flowers ugly
0	what is your name ?
0	reflect and tremble in the presence of any one who has no glance at all
0	thou hast not perceived that subtle spider ’ s web , stretched by destiny betwixt the light and thee -- thou hast flung thyself headlong into it , and now thou art struggling with head broken and mangled wings between the iron antennae of fate !
0	after a dispute , venus , marguerite , and the assistants agreed to submit to the good judgment of time holy virgin
0	certainly , the spectacle is curious , and well deserves the attention of the spectators
0	and off he ran with the pistol
0	there was another moment when , while laughing diabolically at himself , he represented to himself la esmeralda as he had seen her on that first day , lively , careless , joyous , gayly attired , dancing , winged , harmonious , and la esmeralda of the last day , in her scanty shift , with a rope about her neck , mounting slowly with her bare feet , the angular ladder of the gallows ; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner that he gave vent to a terrible cry
0	at my house , replied the old woman
0	the poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny , only by bending over more and more
0	he did not know it , but it was at least a phoebus , and that magic name sufficed to make the archdeacon follow the two heedless comrades with the stealthy tread of a wolf , listening to their words and observing their slightest gestures with anxious attention
0	the english discovered him there
0	unfortunately , montparnasse was troubled
0	these eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of m gillenormand , by collector of his rents , m barge , a retired tip-staff , in the rue du roi-de-sicile
0	around the great fountain , the earth was already dried up to the point of being burnt
0	if ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable , it certainly is to that village of waterloo
0	jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself
0	and the malady was growing worse ; a nurse was required
0	what i have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown
0	the window , tattooed with grape-shot , had lost glass and frame and was nothing now but a shapeless hole , tumultuously blocked with paving-stones
0	he had been appointed mayor , in recognition of his services
0	when he entered the cell , he found it empty
0	he lives , -- or rather , he no longer lives , -- ah well , i do not know
0	his soft , yielding , dislocated , sickly , shapeless ideas attached themselves to enjolras as to a spinal column
0	he extended one arm and then the other , touched the walls on both sides , and perceived that the passage was narrow ; he slipped , and thus perceived that the pavement was wet
0	probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly
0	paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine
0	it is the awakening of something radiant and strange
0	mame hucheloup , quite upset , had taken refuge in the first story
0	but who has thrown down the two rows of statues ?
0	to owe his life to a malefactor , to accept that debt and to repay it ; to be , in spite of himself , on a level with a fugitive from justice , and to repay his service with another service ; to allow it to be said to him , go , and to say to the latter in his turn : be free ; to sacrifice to personal motives duty , that general obligation , and to be conscious , in those personal motives , of something that was also general , and , perchance , superior , to betray society in order to remain true to his conscience ; that all these absurdities should be realized and should accumulate upon him , -- this was what overwhelmed him
0	see her neck , her eyes , her hair , her hands
0	he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean
0	but he stirred no more than if he had been a statue
0	on this point , the priest and the philosopher agree
0	my piece of forty sous !
0	good day , mister elector !
0	ordinarily it ends in that ocean : revolution
0	earthenware and crystal v the key to the red door vi
0	is he not an abominable man ?
0	he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects
0	we shall live as one family
0	and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness , all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue or an idea
0	who is the agent ?
0	the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea , to hide the soldiers between decks , and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel
0	yes , dating from that day , there was within me a man whom i did not know
0	it is i who bar the passage to myself , and i drag myself , and i push myself , and i arrest myself , and i execute myself , and when one holds oneself , one is firmly held
0	then war , whether foreign or civil , is iniquitous ; it is called crime
0	he approached the bed , where she lay sleeping , and trembled with joy
0	still , he had , in a confused way , perceived that gun-barrel aimed at him , and the hand which had blocked it , and he had heard the discharge
0	when will she take her first communion ?
0	it is too frightful
0	thenardier continued : -come instantly -- he paused : -you address her as thou , do you not ?
0	all purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which , more than all the best-planned tender glances of coquettes , possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming , in the depths of the soul , of that sombre flower , impregnated with perfume and with poison , which is called love
0	what are you doing there , my friend ?
0	the establishment of philip v in spain cost france two milliards
0	ejaculated jondrette ; the children must go and watch
0	that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins
0	about the middle of the last century , a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact , for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses , and the bourgeois concealed them , had a little house built in the faubourg saint-germain , in the deserted rue blomet , which is now called rue plumet , not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux
0	god may give me his loveliest star ; i prefer the child thou hast granted me
0	he therefore ascended the northern tower while the beadle below was opening wide the doors of the church , which were then enormous panels of stout wood , covered with leather , bordered with nails of gilded iron , and framed in carvings very artistically elaborated
0	he stood with more than half his body above the breastworks
0	she bit her lips , and her face assumed an expression of hatred
0	all because of a pack of rascally women , who gossip in the workroom
0	he grasped him entire , so to speak , in a single glance
0	you reckoned on a bickering !
0	this is called , for this sad thing has given rise to an expression , to be cast on the pavements of paris
0	his eye lighted up ; his uneven brow , with hollows in some places and bumps in others , hideously wrinkled at the top , was laid bare , his nose had become as sharp as a beak ; the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared
0	while napoleon was passing through the death struggle at longwood , the sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of waterloo were quietly rotting , and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world
0	in its printed form , thought is more imperishable than ever ; it is volatile , irresistible , indestructible
0	this is the hall of the dead , said enjolras
0	old ladies , said he , what do you mean by talking politics ?
0	the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own
0	brave as a grenadier , courageous as a thinker ; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a european shaking up , and unfitted for great political adventures ; always ready to risk his life , never his work ; disguising his will in influence , in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king ; endowed with observation and not with divination ; not very attentive to minds , but knowing men , that is to say requiring to see in order to judge ; prompt and penetrating good sense , practical wisdom , easy speech , prodigious memory ; drawing incessantly on this memory , his only point of resemblance with caesar , alexander , and napoleon ; knowing deeds , facts , details , dates , proper names , ignorant of tendencies , passions , the diverse geniuses of the crowd , the interior aspirations , the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls , in a word , all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences ; accepted by the surface , but little in accord with france lower down ; extricating himself by dint of tact ; governing too much and not enough ; his own first minister ; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas ; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization , of order and organization , an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery , the founder and lawyer of a dynasty ; having something of charlemagne and something of an attorney ; in short , a lofty and original figure , a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of france , and power in spite of the jealousy of europe
0	meanwhile , it riveted upon phoebus two intent eyes , full of that vague light which issues in the night time from the pupils of a cat
0	at dom claude ’ s proposition , the open and benign face of the poet had abruptly clouded over , like a smiling italian landscape , when an unlucky squall comes up and dashes a cloud across the sun
0	that merry scamp ’ s face whose beaming had so often restored serenity to the priest ’ s sombre physiognomy , was now powerless to melt the gloom which grew more dense every day over that corrupted , mephitic , and stagnant soul
0	the montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network
0	have you not a wheel that you can sell me ?
0	if it is absolutely necessary , the first man of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king
0	said he , with clasped hands , our lady of paris , my gracious patroness , pardon me
0	nothing is more simple , he said to himself
0	the mill is there no longer ; the wind is still there
0	the jacobins got the upper hand
0	jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow
0	a noise was audible in the house ; it was the lark sweeping the stairs
0	every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progressing , and progressing favorably , since the preceding day
0	the seed of the nettle , mixed with fodder , gives gloss to the hair of animals ; the root , mixed with salt , produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter
0	jeanne a ton miroir tu t'habilles !
0	behind him and around him , at an infinite distance , he had authority , reason , the case judged , the legal conscience , the public prosecution , all the stars ; he was protecting order , he was causing the law to yield up its thunders , he was avenging society , he was lending a helping hand to the absolute , he was standing erect in the midst of a glory
0	we men fight and we respect the fair sex
0	father gillenormand had seated himself , with a beaming countenance , beside marius
0	in what connection do you make this confession ?
0	all sorts of phantoms haunt these long , solitary corridors ; everywhere is putrescence and miasma ; here and there are breathing-holes , where villon within converses with rabelais without
0	the jacques were the poor
0	the little girl , taking this seriously , fell to sobbing more violently than ever
0	he had just perceived , at the point where the land came to an end and the water began , a large iron grating , low , arched , garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges
0	he has not food every day , and he goes to the play every evening , if he sees good
0	said he , and what about that poor woman ?
0	you have a marvellous memory !
0	he saw cosette every day , he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more , he brooded over the soul of that child , he said to himself that she was his , that nothing could take her from him , that this would last indefinitely , that she would certainly become a nun , being thereto gently incited every day , that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him , that he should grow old there , and that she would grow up there , that she would grow old there , and that he should die there ; that , in short , delightful hope , no separation was possible
0	the trunk had not suffered any internal injury ; a bullet , deadened by the pocket-book , had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideous laceration , which was of no great depth , and consequently , not dangerous
0	the child had mounted a table to load his gun , and was singing gayly the song then so popular : - en voyant lafayette , on beholding lafayette , le gendarme repete : -- the gendarme repeats : -- sauvons nous !
0	messieurs the bourgeois and squires of paris , i don ’ t know , cross of god !
0	after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure , my brother said grace ; then he turned to the man and said to him , you must be in great need of your bed
0	who were a mere handful against an army !
0	she stood for a moment without the power to speak , or cry , or call , or stir , or turn her head
0	even after their life had grown sad , they kept up their custom of early strolls
0	from the movement of the gypsy ’ s lips , quasimodo thought that she was driving him away ; then he rose and retired limping , slowly , with drooping head , without even daring to raise to the young girl his gaze full of despair
0	and whence arose this quarrel ?
0	what became of these men ?
0	and , drawing himself up , and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders , he cried : -and this is the way i save his life !
0	nevertheless the police keep an eye on him , and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry ; that cry which was celebrated about number , is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin ; it scans like a verse from homer , with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the panathenaea , and in it one encounters again the ancient evohe
0	jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark
0	you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers , and once out of it , imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither !
0	here again , he was obliged to come to a decision ; should he go to the right or to the left
0	the two women began to chat
0	and do you know what he has done for me , cosette ?
0	however , all these shades , all these differences , do not affect the surfaces of edifices only
0	what a bitter mockery of fate !
0	the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism , congregation characterized the second
0	you did not know that she was my daughter ; but now you do know it
0	the brat 's tongue 's well hung !
0	give her back to me one day , one hour , one minute ; one minute , lord !
0	from time to time , marius ' knee touched cosette 's knee , and both shivered
0	authority wavers , unity is divided
0	at times , he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly
0	the brat had passed through the crack
0	let us add that if it is according to rule that the architecture of a building should be adapted to its purpose in such a manner that this purpose shall be immediately apparent from the mere aspect of the building , one can not be too much amazed at a structure which might be indifferently -- the palace of a king , a chamber of communes , a town-hall , a college , a riding-school , an academy , a warehouse , a court-house , a museum , a barracks , a sepulchre , a temple , or a theatre
0	it suffices for a god to pass by
0	no one could have told
0	the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant , like the sudden advent of daylight ; other people noticed it also , toussaint had said so , it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken , there could no longer be any doubt of that ; she descended to the garden again , thinking herself a queen , imagining that she heard the birds singing , though it was winter , seeing the sky gilded , the sun among the trees , flowers in the thickets , distracted , wild , in inexpressible delight
0	he had meditated all night long ; he had meditated all the day : he heard within him but one voice , which said , alas !
0	marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed
0	the bullets would have none of him
0	demandait charlot a charlotte
0	and he says to me the ingrate , to me the forgetful , to me the pitiless , to me the guilty one : thanks !
0	on arriving there , he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child
0	this jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of jean montagu , who had given it to the church , which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at montfauçon
0	let 's see where marius will go , said bossuet ; let 's see where the man is going , let 's follow them , hey ?
0	the principal one , and that which was invariable , was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day , and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening
0	the curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own love
0	the unhappy esmeralda dropped her head beneath her flowing hair , comprehending that it was no human being she had to deal with
0	i come from him
0	a city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries , which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes
0	sometimes he set out in that direction ; then he returned
0	it retreats , it grows dim , it diminishes in size
0	come now , will you answer ?
0	i conjure you in the name of heaven , with clasped hands , sir , i throw myself at your feet , permit me to marry her !
0	there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants , but the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants
0	a tear was still visible in her eyes , but motionless and frozen , so to speak
0	he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded , if they had heard him , and if they would come to his assistance
0	the young girl , her eyes bent on the ceiling , as she leaned backwards , quivered , all palpitating , beneath this kiss
0	that evening , before he went to bed , he said again : let us never fear robbers nor murderers
0	he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve
0	he found the man to his taste , but the girl insipid
0	i want to see you smile and hear you say : ah , well , that 's good
0	one of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary 's house
0	and then his laughter came again , when he reflected that phoebus was alive ; that after all , the captain lived , was gay and happy , had handsomer doublets than ever , and a new mistress whom he was conducting to see the old one hanged
0	it was a headlong flight
0	calm yourself , my child , said the doctor ; your child is here
0	m gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt , who had died a centenarian
0	stockings for my little girls , who have none , so to speak , and who are absolutely barefoot just now
0	just look at that face !
0	he defended a rabbit warren against rats , simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed in it
0	all mouths around him were laughing , cursing , and drinking
0	i am at the orders of the very reverend community
0	he always had his pockets full of money when he went out ; but they were empty on his return
0	my eldest daughter will await your orders , dear monsieur marius
0	jean valjean , intoxicated , beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more
0	yes , said the scholar
0	in the west heperceived the slate-roofed tower of braine-l'alleud , which hasthe form of a reversed vase
0	all armed protests , even the most legitimate , even that of the numberth of august , even that of july numberth , begin with the same troubles
0	enjolras , the believer , disdained this sceptic ; and , a sober man himself , scorned this drunkard
0	in the middle of the hall , backed against the western wall , a large and magnificent gallery draped with cloth of gold , into which enter in procession , through a small , arched door , grave personages , announced successively by the shrill voice of an usher
0	besides this he made verses and songs , which gave him great authority
0	people busied themselves over marshal soult 's hesitations
0	these were the moments when she was thinking of her child ; perhaps , also , of the man whom she had loved
0	she came and set her elbows on the table
0	it is true that they had four months and a half of rain , and three floods of the seine
0	we shall , therefore , show nothing of that sweet little flutter of cosette 's rising
0	enjolras disdains me , he muttered
0	he reflected that the people also , the entire populace , had had before their eyes the woman whom he loved exposed almost naked
0	art , which is the conqueror , should have for support science , which is the walker ; the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance
0	the passer-by can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet
0	the old houses crumble and new ones rise
0	said he ; here ’ s a fellow who has been leading a jolly life , to-day
0	very fine , master , this is it
0	je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds
0	he uttered these names incessantly , appropriately and inappropriately , with the tenacity of right
0	slang , being the dialect of corruption , quickly becomes corrupted itself
0	well , resumed jean valjean , i am the person to whom you are to deliver the letter
0	i swear it , fair angel !
0	bellringer of notre-dame , replied quasimodo , supposing that what was required of him was to explain to the judge who he was
0	yes , replied the bishop , you are called my brother
0	there , no more false appearances , no plastering over is possible , filth removes its shirt , absolute denudation puts to the rout all illusions and mirages , there is nothing more except what really exists , presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end
0	meanwhile , the beggars did not grow discouraged
0	he might have been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray
0	no , responded prouvaire , that 's serious
0	and what complaints have they against the bailiff ?
0	marius made the driver a sign to halt , and called to him : -by the hour ?
0	on his arrival at m sur m he had only the garments , the appearance , and the language of a workingman
0	pray take the trouble of getting married , sir
0	i am not to go to prison for six months !
0	master jacques charmolue paraded at their head
0	his body was coiled up on this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground
0	as far as the eye could see , one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs , the city wall , and the fronts of a few factories , resembling barracks or monasteries ; everywhere about stood hovels , rubbish , ancient walls blackened like cerecloths , new white walls like winding-sheets ; everywhere parallel rows of trees , buildings erected on a line , flat constructions , long , cold rows , and the melancholy sadness of right angles
0	the shield was flanked , on the right by an olive branch , on the left by a deer ’ s antlers
0	you see that these are great treats
0	to borrow vulgar phrases , which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express , madame magloire had the air of a peasant , and mademoiselle baptistine that of a lady
0	what was i doing yesterday at this hour ?
0	which of the two will hurl the other over ?
0	while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat , cosette , on her side , had dressed up her sword
0	madame , the baker 's shop was shut
0	year he went quite alone into a country of robbers
0	i have but little taste for that slave-holding brother
0	cried the thenardier , it is yours
0	on the front benches were already a number of venerable figures , muffled in ermine , velvet , and scarlet
0	when cosette saw that her father was suffering less , that he was convalescing , and that he appeared to be happy , she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive , so gently and naturally had it come
0	his white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage
0	ln the second place , metaphor
0	gringoire tossed his head
0	however , nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette
0	chateaupers to the rescue
0	i like you better in love with a petticoat , sapristi !
0	this dream , like the majority of dreams , bore no relation to the situation , except by its painful and heart-rending character , but it made an impression on him
0	he was a bold wretch
0	strange to say , there was another man in the sewer besides himself
0	where had he obtained that blouse ?
0	the pegre is always the poor pegre , and he is always the hare in hiding , the fugitive mouse , the flying bird
0	don don don pour meudon
0	it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached
0	bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the dragon
0	the whole community is in confusion
0	at one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf
0	the season for ploughing is just beginning ; heavy teams are required , and horses are seized upon everywhere , from the post as well as elsewhere
0	such things are joys
0	on a certain afternoon , which had , as will be seen hereafter , some coincidence with the events heretofore related , laigle de meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the cafe musain
0	in the presence of these two lines , he was horribly dazzled ; he remained for a moment , crushed , as it were , by the change of emotion which was taking place within him , he stared at marius ' note with a sort of intoxicated amazement , he had before his eyes that splendor , the death of a hated individual
0	montparnasse 's attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep
0	at the apparition of eponine , the other five , that is to say , claquesous , guelemer , babet , brujon , and montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near , without precipitation , without uttering a word , with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night
0	two of durutte 's regiments go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the swords of the uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of kempt , best , pack , and rylandt ; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat ; friends kill each other in order to escape ; squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other , like the tremendous foam of battle
0	he was a fine talker
0	i think i hear the lock breaking up
0	they had done nothing whatever
0	i will give it to you !
0	a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law , even of the law of charity
0	their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day ; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses , and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck , which was dry in the morning and wet at night
0	he was making his circuit to chastelar
0	marius looked at her , then raised his eyes to heaven , and answered : nothing
0	the rue droit-mur is guarded !
0	there was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that street
0	i waited for you under porches , i stood on the lookout for you at the street corners , i watched for you from the summit of my tower
0	he had no money , but he found means , when it seemed good to him , to indulge in unbridled extravagance
0	this man had stolen apples , but that did not appear to be entirely proved ; what had been proved was , that he had already been in the galleys at toulon
0	this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps
0	one has only to choose
0	they ascended to the first floor
0	towards the middle , at the point where it became level , where delort 's division had passed , the layer of corpses was thinner
0	that was ten years ago , however
0	it was settled that each candidate , man or woman ( for it was possible to choose a female pope ) , should , for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete , cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance
0	this horseman had pierced the english lines
0	she re-entered the lair
0	at a certain moment , he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising , where the barricades had suppressed circulation , and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris
0	oh yes , do call me thou !
0	he even got to within three intervals of trees , but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further , and he hesitated
0	you will say to me , but europe is certainly better than asia ?
0	in the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul
0	brevet gave a start of surprise , and surveyed him from head to foot with a frightened air
0	the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster
0	and in short , interrupted tourangeau , what do you hold to be true and certain ?
0	within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount of emotions
0	in this world of dismal deeds , people keep their secrets
0	he was thinking of fantine and cosette
0	there existed in the army of order , veritable guerilleros , some of the sword , like fannicot , others of the pen , like henri fonfrede
0	all history is nothing but wearisome repetition
0	tis a sad thing to think that all that has existed and exists no longer !
0	no report of any agent had been received there upon this matter , which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable
0	he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew
0	in spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time , the outstretched form made no movement
0	each time that the woman passed in front of him , he bestowed on her , together with a puff from his cigar , some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful , such as , how ugly you are ! -- will you get out of my sight ? -- you have no teeth !
0	she cried , to go and fetch my child !
0	the man of marengo was wiping out agincourt
0	it must needs be a curious thing , that cell which my reverend brother hides so secretly !
0	another man in a black gown rose near the accused ; he was her lawyer -- the judges , who were fasting , began to grumble
0	what does it matter ?
0	nous vivions caches , contents , porte close , devorant l'amour , bon fruit defendu , ma bouche n'avait pas dit une chose que deja ton coeur avait repondu
0	he seemed very much fatigued
0	it is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists
0	in one corner , near the door , and as though prepared for some definite use , two heaps were visible , which appeared to be , the one a heap of old iron , the other a heap of ropes
0	the rumor spread through the troop that he was a former member of the convention , -- an old regicide
0	man is a depth still greater than the people
0	on the whole , however , there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about jean valjean in appearance , at least
0	would not you like to do something for her ?
0	they ran to earth
0	he stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again
0	she will alight from the fiacre
0	it was punchinello who bestowed it on the cat
0	she often repeats it in a low tone when she thinks that she is alone
0	monsieur , retorted gavroche , perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday , but you have degenerated this morning
0	the lantern in the cul-de-sac genrot was thus naturally extinct , like the rest ; and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place
0	marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the clutches of indigence , and who came to feel astonishment , little by little , without , however , being made melancholy by it
0	i can not tell you
0	i write to the examining judge ; he sends for me ; champmathieu is conducted to me -- [ number ] an ex-convict
0	it is terrified , like delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision ; it makes tables turn as dodona did tripods
0	the serene and lofty soul , inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions , dominating the clouds and the shades of this world , its follies , its lies , its hatreds , its vanities , its miseries , inhabits the blue of heaven , and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny , as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake
0	you have got the sniffles , old lady , said gavroche
0	the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea , to hide the soldiers between decks , and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel
0	what , he thought , when my father lay dying on the field of battle , did thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grape-shot , and bear him off on his shoulders , and yet he owed him nothing , and i , who owe so much to thenardier , can not join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death , and in my turn bring him back from death to life !
0	one thought one beheld hubbub petrified
0	these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were on their way to the right bank
0	do i love thee , angel of my life !
0	he has torn up the wheat with the tares ; tis all the same
0	this is the perpetual adoration
0	his sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children ?
0	another silence ensued ; then the bishop went on : -madame magloire , i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully
0	jean valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient paris , which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts , which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city , dimly lighted at mid-day , and is , so to speak , incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old , which hold their peace like ancients as they are
0	there was also , among the prettiest of them , a charming girl of three and twenty , who was from the isle de bourbon , a descendant of the chevalier roze , whose name had been mademoiselle roze , and who was called mother assumption
0	hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old , and involuntary on the part of the young
0	you would have none of the honest weariness of men , you shall have the sweat of the damned
0	she said at length
0	do you see that demon passing and repassing in front of the fire ? exclaimed the duke of egypt
0	these scotchmen died thinking of ben lothian , as did the greeks recalling argos
0	it is true that she costs us money ; it is true that she has her faults ; it is true that we are not rich ; it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses !
0	among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds , there was one sceptic
0	a single dish of meat and vegetables combined , or salt fish -- such was their luxury
0	i wo not go , so there now , pouted eponine like a spoiled child ; you send me off , and it 's four months since i saw you , and i have hardly had time to kiss you
0	it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery , and that everything hung upon this chance
0	she was decidedly a marvellous beauty
0	i want to see her
0	it did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally or materially , and could not sweep out filth any better than it could abuses
0	bitou carried a great bull on his shoulders ; the water-wagtails , the warblers , and the buntings traverse the ocean
0	he repeated , as though talking to himself : -the petit-picpus convent
0	she might be taken away directly afterwards
0	these are melancholy days ; for there is always a certain amount of night even in this madness , there is suicide in this duel , and those words which are intended to be insults -- beggars , canaille , ochlocracy , populace -- exhibit , alas !
0	a glazed door opened on the garden ; opposite this was the bed , -- a hospital bed of iron , with a canopy of green serge ; in the shadow of the bed , behind a curtain , were the utensils of the toilet , which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world : there were two doors , one near the chimney , opening into the oratory ; the other near the bookcase , opening into the dining-room
0	he operated on me for a cataract , he said
0	jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden
0	we are sacrificing ourselvesmourn for us in haste , and replace us with speed
0	lovers have no need of any people whatever
0	for a moment , marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man , a sister of the former , no doubt
0	his coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters
0	this last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more , because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times
0	my sister , who was older , was terrified and wept
0	none of that , none of that
0	this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m madeleine 's chamber
0	one would have pronounced them elegant grayhounds , circling , with inflated nostrils , round a poor woodland fawn , whom the glance of their master forbade them to devour
0	an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory
0	he had not learned to read in his childhood
0	utopia to-day , flesh and blood to-morrow
0	as soon as pierre gringoire had seen how this whole affair was turning , and that there would decidedly be the rope , hanging , and other disagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy , he had not cared to identify himself with the matter further
0	in the meantime , she had halted in front of marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance , and something which resembled a smile
0	i suspected as much
0	quasimodo was standing behind her
0	there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets
0	on the morrow , towards midday , fantine awoke
0	this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer
0	but the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty
0	after all , we don ’ t wish you any harm
0	ought he to hold his peace ?
0	liars of terrible devotion , caverns of virgins , ferocious places
0	what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him , and how much wit must men have , in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity !
0	the effort was powerful , prodigious , desperate ; but the provost ’ s seasoned bonds resisted
0	we salute the man who kneels
0	when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair , she began to hate every one about her
0	this simple remark caused the sword which glittered in the captain ’ s hand to be lowered
0	i get down here , said the man
0	agreed , i tell you
0	the vision had been eclipsed , now it reappeared
0	what have you against me ?
0	how agreeable that is !
0	this was the accused
0	as he uttered these monstrous words , he assumed the mien of ajax , expecting to see the lightnings descend upon his head
0	it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night
0	it was a chateau ; it is no longer anything but a farm
0	all these streets , moreover , were more ancient than paris
0	theodule , on his side , though he scented the inheritance , was disgusted at the task of pleasing
0	generally they were books of travel
0	his words tumbled over each other
0	a moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder so that she straightened herself up in a sitting posture , wide awake and furious
0	this frightful situation , which had already lasted above half an hour , was changing its aspect every moment
0	she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it
0	one would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses , -- the one in which one loses one 's self and that in which one saves one 's self
0	at all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of a young face in the house , -- these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to ruin , -- it was expedient to find another marius
0	said the old gentleman , in alarm
0	guelemer seized gavroche by one arm , set him on the roof of the shanty , whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin 's weight , and handed him the rope which brujon had knotted together during montparnasse 's absence
0	that done , he closed her eyes
0	m myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it
0	towards four o'clock the condition of the english army was serious
0	they declared themselves the friends of the a b c , -- the abaisse , -- the debased , -- that is to say , the people
0	moreover , he had something decisive to say , and , even against this very well-informed and well-armed baron pontmercy , he felt himself strong
0	after that , you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the rue guibourg , at widow doris 's , and rue du garraud-blanc , at madame renee le bosse 's , and you will prepare documents
0	i want to hear them sing and make them dance
0	i have had enough of that coughing king !
0	whatever to-day may be , to-morrow will be peace
0	finally , father gillenormand had said to his daughter : i have had enough of that theodule
0	he wants to give me a surprise , you know !
0	the fontis were due to different causes : the friability of the soil ; some landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man ; the violent summer rains ; the incessant flooding of winter ; long , drizzling showers
0	there is no festival which comes up to an execution on the place de greve
0	you have uttered a reply , knave , which deserves the halter
0	thenardier retraced his steps
0	at the end of this street , which was very short , he found further passage barred in the direction of the halles by a tall row of houses , and he would have thought himself in a blind alley , had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape
0	he was not a child , he was not a man ; he was a strange gamin-fairy
0	cosette will arrange your books for you , your voyages of captain cook and the other , -- vancouver 's and all your affairs
0	she replied : he 's a saint
0	but the other was so confused that he did not see him
0	it seems as though its respiration were made of hope
0	marius entered the rue saint-honore through the passage delorme
0	we would love each other , we would pour our two souls into each other , and we would have a thirst for ourselves which we would quench in common and incessantly at that fountain of inexhaustible love
0	it is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night
0	the rain still rendered the street completely deserted
0	he stared at the public , and , perceiving that they were laughing , and not understanding why , he began to laugh himself
0	but -- you will have an iron bar
0	i will make you work to the tune of the whip ; that i will
0	it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon
0	tis one of my friends
0	their wood and wine were put into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay near the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice as a grotto ; for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was without a grotto
0	he has escaped ; we are in search of him -- that jean valjean ; you have not seen him ?
0	so he has dived through the earth
0	we have time enough
0	how had all this happened ?
0	you are a liar , a calumniator , a villain
0	we will warm you up
0	she met m le curé of saint-remy , and said to him : monsieur , i will till the earth with my finger-nails , but give me back my child !
0	the matter must have been greatly protracted , and they are holding an evening session
0	said she , come , let us see what it is
0	that man , who had so manly an air , yet who was weeping like a woman , had struck the warden
0	jean valjean preserved silence
0	the waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him
0	he bore it at the bottom of his mind , in the depths of his memory , in that sacred injunction : a certain thenardier saved my life
0	marius went away confident , and cosette uneasy
0	to see her once again ; he still aspired to this , but he no longer expected it
0	he clung to it with desperate hands , and , at the moment when he opened his mouth to utter a second cry , he beheld the formidable and avenging face of quasimodo thrust over the edge of the balustrade above his head
0	who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary ?
0	it is not , like the cathedral of bourges , the magnificent , light , multiform , tufted , bristling efflorescent product of the pointed arch
0	the unhappy girl quivered in every limb
0	the generation which is passing in its turn over the earth , is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations , its equal , after all , who will have their turn later on -- i exist , murmurs that some one whose name is all
0	he said : -javert -- javert interrupted him : call me mr
0	the greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes
0	goodman fauchelevent , the ex-notary , belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance
0	he was vexed with himself , he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened , blinded , and carried him away
0	we may still arrive in time
0	here it is seven o ’ clock
0	has she not a child which she desires to see ?
0	m madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it , and it lay on the chimney-piece
0	ney borrows a horse , leaps upon it , and without hat , cravat , or sword , places himself across the brussels road , stopping both english and french
0	this package was taken to the police station
0	thus , breakfast four sous , dinner sixteen sous ; his food cost him twenty sous a day ; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year
0	it uses it in accordance with its fancy , it dips into it hap-hazard , and it often confines itself , when occasion arises , to alter it in a gross and summary fashion
0	so you don ’ t want me for your husband ?
0	they reached in silence the rue des bernardins , which was nearly deserted
0	come , little cousin , she said to him , plucking him by the sleeve , in order to speak in his ear , look at her , do !
0	poor , yes ; unhappy , no
0	are you going far in this condition ?
0	i had only to go away ; there are diligences in the rue bouloy ; you are happy ; i am going
0	when she had passed the corner of the last house , cosette paused
0	there ensued a most terrible silence ; then , all at once , a long file of uplifted arms , brandishing sabres , appeared above the crest , and casques , trumpets , and standards , and three thousand heads with gray mustaches , shouting , vive l'empereur !
0	a moment later she resumed : -is she still there ?
0	all at once the man turned round once more ; he saw the inn-keeper
0	he removed his hat , and , saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness : -excuse me , mr mayor -- the words mr mayor produced a curious effect upon fantine
0	the big furrier , without uttering a word in reply , tried to escape all the eyes riveted upon him from all sides ; but he perspired and panted in vain ; like a wedge entering the wood , his efforts served only to bury still more deeply in the shoulders of his neighbors , his large , apoplectic face , purple with spite and rage
0	as for the mother , her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken
0	the hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the champs-elysees
0	and he tore his hair
0	then tearing the woman 's chemise which he was wearing , he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl 's bleeding wrist
0	javert began again : thou saidst fauchelevent , rue de l'homme arme ?
0	any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts , into which there entered such grave thought , would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him
0	evidently he did not
0	accursed be thou , daughter of egypt !
0	in addition to the philological origins just indicated , slang possesses other and still more natural roots , which spring , so to speak , from the mind of man itself
0	he had not to deal with a perpendicular wall , but with one which sloped away beneath him
0	he felt an immense joy
0	in the meanwhile , two other maskers in the same carriage , a spaniard with an enormous nose , an elderly air , and huge black moustache , and a gaunt fishwife , who was quite a young girl , masked with a loup , [ number ] had also noticed the wedding , and while their companions and the passers-by were exchanging insults , they had held a dialogue in a low voice
0	the fugitives pausing breathless for a moment in the distance , listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ever-decreasing thunder
0	i asked my grandfather , he refused ; i have no fortune , neither hast thou
0	gavroche after staring into the air , stared below ; he raised himself on tiptoe , and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor ; they were all shut , bolted , and padlocked
0	nothing , however , indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard
0	remember this , gossip coppenole
0	gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the cannon-ball
0	he found not a word to say
0	obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them
0	ordinarily , i am believed
0	it is a continuation of her slumber
0	you see that i am composing
0	mathias corvin favored jean de monroyal , the ornament of mathematics
0	one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other
0	as for me , i had my little cosette , and i was actually forced to become a bad woman
0	at two hundred francs the metre , the sixty leagues of paris ' sewers of the present day represent forty-eight millions
0	he payeth not sufficiently his physician , replied the doctor , casting a side glance at his companion
0	the second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious
0	go to your rendezvous , said the man
0	and when you know how to read !
0	the parvis was filled with a thick smoke , which the musketry streaked with flame
0	the section owns no arms
0	weariness , the lack of good weapons , the fright of this surprise , the musketry from the windows , the valiant attack of the king ’ s troops , all overwhelmed them
0	there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled marius
0	he went on : monsieur le baron , a sewer is not the champ de mars
0	what is the meaning of the words , la esmeralda ?
0	this , then , is what appears to philosophical politicians : -at the same time that weary men demand repose , accomplished facts demand guarantees
0	monsieur le maire , said the bishop , is that really all ?
0	you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
0	do not be afraid ! -- that 's it ! -- come on ! -- put your feet there ! -- give us your hand here ! -- boldly !
0	the two little boys exchanged terrified glances
0	this furnished a sort of respite
0	here you , rennet cousin !
0	we are still in the rue de l'homme arme
0	he breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since javert 's visit
0	nevertheless , he did not become discouraged
0	second problem : to share it
0	he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer
0	immediately , said oudarde , tis a charity
0	a flash passed , a report rang out
0	at the moment when we were entering the papal gate i saw a reed warbler flit through the air , that was at the end of august ; i said , it will be a hard winter
0	but this great england will be angry at what we are saying here
0	not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar
0	he was this same brigand of the loire
0	tis as thickly clustered as the head of a cabbage !
0	yes , my good monsieur courfeyrac
0	when they arrived on the grand square , however , the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up , in the front of a vast and gloomy building
0	to contemplate is to labor , to think is to act
0	society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air , all of it !
0	thus , against the wind , it has its cordage and its canvas ; against the water , wood ; against the rocks , its iron , brass , and lead ; against the shadows , its light ; against immensity , a needle
0	he was conscious , in a confused way , that a violent crisis was approaching
0	thenardier resumed : let 's settle up
0	i do not make a pack of gyrations , i go straight to the mark , be happy
0	it was the road to bicetre
0	but answer me , in the name of heaven !
0	note this , friend olivier
0	the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of theramene , which is not useful to tragedy , but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence
0	the masses are traitors to the people
0	subject of the kingdom of argot ?
0	woe to the brain-worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery !
0	and who ate the cat ?
0	they are all mounted , and set at defiance those of captain mignon
0	moreover , there will be no decree ; that quasimodo !
0	do not forget what i told you
0	tis a pity that you have no hair !
0	no one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth , which lives within the unhappy man , and of which he is dying
0	jean valjean was seized with a shudder
0	there was no longer any need of saying , what is the use ?
0	well , you have not a very wildly lively imagination , comrades
0	master coppenole , in amazement , approached him
0	monsieur le baron , you have in your house a thief and an assassin
0	omnibuses , said he , do not pass the corinthe
0	some stammer , others lisp
0	on the horizonthrough the trees , he perceived a sort of little elevation , and on this elevation something which at that distance resembleda lion
0	the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot , he was worn out with fatigue , but he rose , laid his books on the bench , and walked , all bent over and with tottering footsteps , to the well , but when he had grasped the chain , he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it
0	an artisan was fastening mother hucheloup 's big straw hat on his head with a string , for fear of sun-stroke , as he said
0	the child raised her great eyes , in which hung a tear , which was not visible because of the darkness , and replied gently : -yes , sir
0	i am in possession of a secret concerning an individual
0	these haggard , ragged , exhausted men , who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours , who had not slept , who had but a few more rounds to fire , who were fumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges , nearly all of whom were wounded , with head or arm bandaged with black and blood-stained linen , with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled , and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords , became titans
0	all this cavalry debouched on the plateau , and it was like the appearance of an earthquake
0	he performed a multitude of good actions , concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions
0	a second discharge , similar to the first , rained down upon the barricade
0	if you think that i am going to return and talk platitudes to you , you are mistaken
0	was he , in the midst of these distractions , these affections which absorbed his life , suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm , by striking to his heart , a man whom public catastrophes would not shake , by striking at his existence and his fortune ?
0	as he spoke , he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron , and he continued : -hold , i know now
0	how do you do , master pierre ?
0	the kitchen shared the ground-floor with the tap-room
0	the window was still open
0	we shall have to sell our plate !
0	was there , then , any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of marius ?
0	and , taking the cake from his son , he flung it into the basin
0	he took them and laid them in eponine 's hand
0	so that one would think she was a lady !
0	we must not all three gaze into the hole at once , for fear of alarming the recluse
0	all at once , bossuet caught sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air
0	jean valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle
0	as the second-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell , they purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs , sometimes at those very shops
0	i see that plainly , from the progress of velvet stuffs , said the fur-merchant
0	now , before going to the galleys for theft , what was jean valjean ?
0	he had laid his hand lightly on cosette 's mouth
0	he was well slashed up on this occasion , and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone
0	javert raised his head , saw jean valjean , made an almost imperceptible movement , and said : that is just
0	it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men
0	at daybreak , the conductor of the diligence shouted : vernon !
0	in the midst of his revery there came a knock at his door
0	and he directed his steps towards the door
0	on another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell ( which he never entered ) at the moment when la esmeralda was singing an old spanish ballad , the words of which she did not understand , but which had lingered in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child
0	the day will come , citizens , when all will be concord , harmony , light , joy and life ; it will come , and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die
0	this rope fell at their feet
0	he would have answered : no
0	to give away forty-franc dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous , so i would !
0	a man had just accosted the street urchin , and the man was no other than montparnasse in disguise , with blue spectacles , but recognizable to gavroche
0	tis i look at me ; tis the little one whom thou wilt surely not repulse , who comes , who comes herself to seek thee
0	the dining-room was full of gay things
0	one hardly dares to say , nowadays , that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other
0	if i had only another one myself !
0	this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin , a profound epiphonema , which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending , -- dieu de dieu !
0	then he passed to the frontier of italy , and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert
0	all that i tell you is the truth
0	the cats are there
0	well , after all , so much the better , that is what i was hoping for , this will kill me on the spot
0	nevertheless , he was not dead when he reached there
0	is not my daughter beautiful ?
0	the revolution broke out
0	to see the dissolute wench hang on the blear-eyed gibbet , windows are eyes
0	never had a living creature been thrust more deeply into nothingness
0	this was not , however , the only stupor which the apparitions and the disappearances of the past had left in his mind
0	this pun which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much stuporeverything which falls in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect
0	the man was not asleep , but nothing could arouse him
0	for being willing to die is the same as to die ; and it was not this man 's fault if he survived after he was shot
0	let ’ s take him to the king !
0	to behold that body whose form burns you , that bosom which possesses so much sweetness , that flesh palpitate and blush beneath the kisses of another !
0	how can it surprise us that all human thought flows in this channel ?
0	i could see that
0	a dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created a diversion !
0	he kept the sixteen sous , and handed the five francs to the young girl
0	what is he doing ?
0	what a fine dream !
0	let us make an exception in favor of paris , nevertheless
0	sultan , her cat , which might have mewed allegri 's miserere in the sixtine chapel , had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion which existed in her
0	unless , like myself , he should stop on the way
0	monsieur le maire , permit me -- not another word
0	the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions , and narrated to him the episode of the thousand-franc bill
0	he said to the elder , i will lend you a hand
0	impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us , and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville
0	receive , eternal father , the assurance of my distinguished consideration
0	i went there in my mother 's arms
0	but jean valjean is a sly dog
0	thenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him
0	the experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of austerlitz , which had a bad exposure
0	this , be it said , is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent , and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man
0	it is towards the end of april that the work of the cheese-dairies begins ; it is towards the middle of june that the cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains
0	all things are in place in that art , self-created , logical , and well proportioned
0	they consisted of a goodman , about fifty years of age , who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six
0	this outrage committed on the most holy sacrament of the altar , though but temporary , would not depart from these holy souls , and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a perpetual adoration in some female monastery
0	you see , there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may , in the very heart of the winter ; and you must have pity on such a being , my good monsieur javert
0	any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed cosette at this first stage , when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister
0	in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor , he said : look at the people of briancon !
0	le temps des amours devait durer toujours !
0	there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams
0	the three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish definitely ; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely
0	i take not too much of anything
0	the heat of the brazier was so great , that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the chafing-dish , and was drooping over
0	and a fine one too !
0	if , at that period of her existence , cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched , she would have been lost ; for there are generous natures which yield themselves , and cosette was one of them
0	there were piles of rough blocks of stone , sheets of lead in rolls , bundles of laths , heavy beams already notched with the saw , heaps of plaster
0	monsieur pontmercy , said jean valjean , i was nineteen years in the galleys
0	he walked with a firm step to the wall , thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him , detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there , and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health , and said in a loud voice , as he laid the crucifix on the table : behold the great martyr
0	just now , as i was coming hither , replied jean valjean , i saw a piece of furniture in the rue saint louis
0	athwart that waving hair , more glossy than the plumage of a raven , a thick , rough , gray rope was visible , twisted and knotted , chafing her delicate collar-bones and twining round the charming neck of the poor girl , like an earthworm round a flower
0	while drinking with the carters , smoking , and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening , he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger , watching him like a cat , and studying him like a mathematician
0	well , my dear fair one , i had a falling out with mahè fédy , you know ?
0	for my pleasure , you mean to say , my dear aunt
0	it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged
0	she thrust her head through the window , and withdrew it again hastily
0	the blind man ran !
0	it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
0	with his left hand , he negligently folded back his shirt around his right arm , to the very armpit
0	this he called having royal renown
0	enjolras was a charming young man , who was capable of being terrible
0	the priest looked at her coldly
0	you were in a glory , and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms
0	these badly guarded souls listen
0	for one moment , he was relieved
0	i do not let myself be taken in with that nonsense
0	boyanches-tu ( bois-tu ) , do you drink ?
0	i well know why , and he went away
0	in the course of twenty minutes , she asked the nun more than ten times , what time is it , sister ?
0	and the little shoe ?
0	he had all thirty-two of his teeth
0	it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert ; it is something quite different
0	the police are full of cleverness
0	the hieroglyph deserts the cathedral , and betakes itself to blazoning the donjon keep , in order to lend prestige to feudalism
0	lafayette spoke and bade lamarque farewell
0	the miserable body which that frightful swarm of saws , wheels , and racks were about to clasp in their clutches , the being who was about to be manipulated by the harsh hands of executioners and pincers , was that gentle , white , fragile creature , a poor grain of millet which human justice was handing over to the terrible mills of torture to grind
0	in the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air
0	i will go and carry it to him
0	at that moment , she had a vague feeling that destiny is an irresistible force
0	and , disengaging the hand which marius held , he added , with a sort of inexorable dignity : moreover , the friend to whom i have recourse is the doing of my duty ; and i need but one pardon , that of my conscience
0	this latter can say , like julia alpinula : hic jaceo
0	the third , a man with thick-set shoulders , not so slender as the first , held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison
0	the unknown is an ocean
0	it was he who said : the cardinals are the peers of france of rome ; the lords are the peers of france of england

0	meanwhile what becomes of printing ?
0	one mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard , properly speaking
0	one evening , marius was on his way to the rendezvous , by way of the boulevard des invalides
0	gentlemen of the watch !
0	on the one hand , a moral pest , guarded from sight , penned up under the range of cannon , and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims ; on the other , the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth
0	marius , motionless , with his body resting in the corner , and his head drooping on his breast , his arms hanging , his legs stiff , seemed to be awaiting only a coffin ; jean valjean seemed made of shadow , and javert of stone , and in that vehicle full of night , whose interior , every time that it passed in front of a street lantern , appeared to be turned lividly wan , as by an intermittent flash of lightning , chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility , the corpse , the spectre , and the statue
0	when he was known to be rich , people in society bowed to him , and he received invitations in the town ; he was called , in town , monsieur madeleine ; his workmen and the children continued to call him father madeleine , and that was what was most adapted to make him smile
0	they intended to bring up the child in their own way
0	never again should he read those books ; never more should he write on that little table of white wood ; his old portress , the only servant whom he kept , would never more bring him his coffee in the morning
0	dom claude frollo had , however , abandoned neither science nor the education of his young brother , those two occupations of his life
0	among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances , which we preserve out of respect for the truth
0	is not that enough ?
0	he was the marble lover of liberty
0	the instant that madeleine 's glance encountered javert 's glance , javert , without stirring , without moving from his post , without approaching him , became terrible
0	and the two scholars , jehan du moulin , and robin poussepain , sang at the top of their lungs , the ancient refrain , --
0	i have sounded the depths of medicine and astrology , i tell you !
0	chimed in a man , flinging a broken jug at his breast
0	one was , in fact , in a sort of theatre-box , narrow , furnished with two old chairs , and a much-frayed straw matting , sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door ; a regular box , with its front just of a height to lean upon , bearing a tablet of black wood
0	let the abandoned allow themselves to be abandoned , let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled , and let us confine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far , when they do retreat
0	how come you here , father madeleine ?
0	life and the social order have said their last word for her
0	a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of god , which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise , which comes both from below like the voice of the lion , and from on high like the voice of the thunder
0	he was , so far as the feeble light of the lamp permitted one to judge , an old man about sixty years of age and of medium stature , who appeared somewhat sickly and broken in health
0	but the right to live apart , even with its inconveniences and its abuses , insists on being stated and taken into account
0	and i -- said he , what , then , am i ?
0	said gossip jacques , because he is their lord
0	this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from moret in number , by colonel brack , and designated as the house of francois i
0	bossuet asked jean valjean
0	a peculiarity of this species of war is , that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front , and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position , either because they fear ambushes , or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets
0	marius was on the high road to adoring his father
0	that famous treasure of his dreams was probably there
0	the forest surrounding the abbey of villiers sheltered these unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad , for many days and nights
0	yes , that 's true , he must be a man by this time
0	she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of arras
0	he , the poor man , was rich ; he , the abandoned , had a family ; he , the despairing , was to marry cosette
0	the whole nave was deserted
0	in this terrible situation , the archdeacon said not a word , uttered not a groan
0	there must be an end to this !
0	it was no longer solitude , for there were passers-by ; it was not the country , for there were houses and streets ; it was not the city , for the streets had ruts like highways , and the grass grew in them ; it was not a village , the houses were too lofty
0	marius did well not to dream of going thither
0	on the morrow , -- for he only existed from morrow to morrow , there was , so to speak , no to-day for him , -- on the morrow , he found no one at the luxembourg ; he had expected this
0	replied javert ; people are in the habit of talking aloud to me
0	sometimes they enter into combat there
0	her father is taking her to england , and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage
0	she gave us her last commands
0	from time to time favourite exclaimed : -and the surprise ?
0	the grain is in the furrow , the harvest will certainly be fine
0	as he made his cassocks last a long while , and did not wish to have it noticed , he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak
0	a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years ; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst
0	on seeing this , the barricade burst into a laugh
0	i think , in fact , replied phoebus , that it can not be far from midday
0	he walked on desperately , almost fast , proceeded thus for a hundred paces , almost without drawing breath , and suddenly came in contact with the wall
0	in proportion as the house is erected , i am ruined
0	javert had never beheld the unknown except from below
0	i shall not listen
0	he sped thus across the fields until evening
0	he read the moniteur , he read all the histories of the republic and the empire , the memorial de sainte-helene , all the memoirs , all the newspapers , the bulletins , the proclamations ; he devoured everything
0	sire , you are an august and , very puissant monarch ; have pity on a poor man who is honest , and who would find it more difficult to stir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark !
0	ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people
0	an armed throng was passing , and a terrified throng looked on
0	he felt a desire to open his arms , to call him , to fling himself forward ; his heart melted with rapture , affectionate words swelled and overflowed his breast ; at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips , and , by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of his nature , what came forth was harshness
0	yes , you clearly behold the future , yes , you are right
0	from the angular imprint of that knee he recognized quasimodo ; but what was to be done ?
0	the date of the year number was indicated , nevertheless , by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class : to wit , a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin
0	triton trottait devant , et tirait de sa conque des sons si ravissants qu'il ravissait quiconque !
0	my poor bahorel , she is a superb girl , very literary , with tiny feet , little hands , she dresses well , and is white and dimpled , with the eyes of a fortune-teller
0	we want to go away !
0	the reader knows the manner of death of robert de clermont , marshal of france , and of jean de châlons , marshal of champagne ; and yet the question was only of a certain perrin marc , the clerk of a money-changer , a miserable assassin ; but the two marshals had broken the doors of st méry
0	all heads were raised : the sensation was indescribable ; there was a momentary hesitation in the audience , the voice had been so heart-rending ; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first
0	on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted
0	m leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance
0	what is it to me that she is in paradise ?
0	the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine
0	there was nothing in the hutch , but there were a few apples in the fruit-closet , -- the remains of the winter 's provision
0	the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of marius ' melancholy -- stop , said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides , this is her meadow
0	in order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him , he borrowed the beadle 's outfit for a day , and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening , whining orisons through his nose , and playing the spy under cover of prayer
0	his cowl , which was still lowered , formed a sort of mask ; and every time that he spread his arms , upon which hung large black sleeves , as he rowed , one would have said they were two huge bat ’ s wings
0	the man bent his steps towards this inn , which was the best in the country-side
0	m gillenormand continued : -then i understand the girl is rich ?
0	in less than three hours , like a train of powder catching fire , the insurgents had invaded and occupied , on the right bank , the arsenal , the mayoralty of the place royale , the whole of the marais , the popincourt arms manufactory , la galiote , the chateau-d'eau , and all the streets near the halles ; on the left bank , the barracks of the veterans , sainte-pelagie , the place maubert , the powder magazine of the deux-moulins , and all the barriers
0	in vain does napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his guard ; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons
0	yesterday , only my feet were cold ; to-day , the chill has ascended to my knees ; now i feel it mounting to my waist ; when it reaches the heart , i shall stop
0	combeferre brought back the basket of cartridges ; marius bore the child
0	and you have brought him back here ?
0	marius did not hear this reply
0	he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself , and went down the rue des postes , towards the region of the jardin des plantes
0	jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fauchelevent opening the door
0	facts , however , are awkward things to disconcert , and they are obstinate
0	the archdeacon ’ s brow did not lose a single wrinkle
0	and when the legate passed , you remember , gisquette ?
0	but she must leave that place , nevertheless !
0	well , they were right
0	this theory m gillenormand had himself applied , and it had become his history
0	you have only to enter
0	it 's the dogs who complain
0	in the second , perpetuity ; the sole hope , at the distant extremity of the future , that faint light of liberty which men call death
0	when our philosopher felt the boat sway , he clapped his hands and kissed djali between the horns
0	the right to the alphabet , that is where the beginning must be made
0	you will find at my house , among the ashes in the fireplace , the forty-sou piece which i stole , seven years ago , from little gervais
0	and half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key , he added : do you want to see how a key to liberty is made ?
0	but he was not shutting it !
0	it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day
0	the sage is the man who knows how , at a given moment , to effect his own arrest
0	what would they say if i did not go ?
0	by degrees , however , her terror disappeared , and she yielded herself wholly to the slow and melancholy air which she was singing
0	sometimes it rotted there ; human justice called this forgetting
0	the others gave more light , he shed more warmth ; the truth is , that he possessed all the qualities of a centre , roundness and radiance
0	all was peace and silence ; there was no one on the road ; a few stray laborers , of whom they caught barely a glimpse , were on their way to their work along the side-paths
0	then he turned to jean valjean
0	if the reader desires to know by whom , he has only to lend an ear to the conversation of three worthy gossips , who , at the moment when we have directed his attention to the rat-hole , were directing their steps towards the same spot , coming up along the water ’ s edge from the châtelet , towards the grève
0	i have seen the child
0	i have been waiting for the first blow this quarter of an hour ; nothing comes ; they are cowards who only scratch each other with insults
0	he wept thus for a considerable time
0	basque returned , set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired
0	i am capable of descending the rue de gres , of crossing the place saint-michel , of sloping through the rue monsieur-le-prince , of taking the rue de vaugirard , of passing the carmelites , of turning into the rue d'assas , of reaching the rue du cherche-midi , of leaving behind me the conseil de guerre , of pacing the rue des vielles tuileries , of striding across the boulevard , of following the chaussee du maine , of passing the barrier , and entering richefeu 's
0	as far as the immediate means were concerned , a violent situation being given , he wished to be violent ; on that point , he never varied ; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up in the words : eighty-three
0	human thought discovers a mode of perpetuating itself , not only more durable and more resisting than architecture , but still more simple and easy
0	the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures
0	about six o'clock in the evening , the passage du saumon became the field of battle
0	he was himself vigorous and formidable ; he armed himself with his staff , made a shield of his knapsack , and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could , not without enlarging the rents in his rags
0	the phenomenon of number after napoleon was reproduced in number after charles x
0	good , here i am uttering demagogical words !
0	he lives alone , which renders him a little sad , perhaps ; enjolras complains of his greatness , which binds him to widowhood
0	this punic labor , incontestably authorized by war , which permits traps , was so well done , that haxo , who had been despatched by the emperor at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy 's batteries , had discovered nothing of it , and had returned and reported to napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two barricades which barred the road to nivelles and to genappe
0	without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it , and that it must be concealed
0	he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned
0	the ravine was there , unexpected , yawning , directly under the horses ' feet , two fathoms deep between its double slopes ; the second file pushed the first into it , and the third pushed on the second ; the horses reared and fell backward , landed on their haunches , slid down , all four feet in the air , crushing and overwhelming the riders ; and there being no means of retreat , -- the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile , -- the force which had been acquired to crush the english crushed the french ; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled ; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell , grinding each other , forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf : when this trench was full of living men , the rest marched over them and passed on
0	they had strange heads
0	you are poor ; i see that plainly
0	the stars are like the lamps in illuminations , one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out , i am bewildered , as though horses were breathing in my ears ; although it is night , i hear hand-organs and spinning-machines , and i do not know what all
0	not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky
0	she lost sight of him in two minutes , and returned breathless , three-quarters choked with asthma , and furious
0	he glanced to the left
0	he desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas : he said : revolution , but civilization ; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky
0	the nuns were severe only towards themselves
0	to replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food
0	he said : -this is what i have to say
0	they certainly were the two prettiest little pink shoes that could be seen
0	one day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of vernon , stepped up to him , and said : mr crown attorney , am i permitted to wear my scar ?
0	citeaux dates from saint robert , abbe de molesme , in the diocese of langres , in number
0	let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb
0	after a momentary hesitation : -bah !
0	you know , madame , that many very pious princes have overstepped the privileges of the churches for the glory of god and the necessities of the state
0	louis philippe was perfectly serene
0	anxiety reigned everywhere , and a certain tremor which was not habitual with paris
0	fantine acquired this sublime talent , and regained a little courage
0	in six months the little girl had become a young maiden ; that was all
0	what an idea to go to the witches ’ sabbath !
0	i have cried till i have no eyes left
0	there already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man
0	besides this , javert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds
0	at the same time she began to speak , but in a voice so supplicating , so gentle , so submissive , so heartrending , that more than one old convict-warder around tristan who must have devoured human flesh wiped his eyes
0	that at least was jehan ’ s idea , when he heard him exclaim , with the thoughtful breaks of a dreamer thinking aloud , --
0	jean valjean 's injunction , and the name of madame thenardier , had chilled her blood
0	the marquis d'avaray , whom louis xviii
0	it is not the will which is lacking , said a voice
0	he will not grow weary
0	tumultuous and stagnant gulf
0	then -- but i can surely hire a horse in the village ?
0	he made the tour of the garden , the garden was deserted
0	exclaimed the stupefied director
0	a child , i tell you ! -- a pretty little girl ! -- my agnes !
0	but , let us avow it , this idea , which seemed natural at the first blush , appeared to him after a moment 's reflection , as strange , impossible , and almost repulsive
0	if adamastor were to appear to him , the street arab would say : hi there !
0	m le duc d'angouleme , the bastard of his majesty charles ix , married a silly jade of fifteen when he was eighty-five ; m virginal , marquis d'alluye , brother to the cardinal de sourdis , archbishop of bordeaux , had , at the age of eighty-three , by the maid of madame la presidente jacquin , a son , a real child of love , who became a chevalier of malta and a counsellor of state ; one of the great men of this century , the abbe tabaraud , is the son of a man of eighty-seven
0	he groped his way up the stairs , as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey , opened and shut his door softly , listened to see whether he could hear any noise , -- made sure that , to all appearances , cosette and toussaint were asleep , and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark , so greatly did his hand tremble
0	the hair which is not on the heads of your hussies one finds in your omelettes
0	however , it was necessary to control herself
0	there were five missives , five histories , five signatures , and a single signer
0	it is not hebrew ; tis latin
0	some , among the number notre-dame , were fortified
0	the boy , whose name was marius , knew that he had a father , but nothing more
0	the crowd was swarming around her ; from time to time , a man accoutred in red and yellow made them form into a circle , and then returned , seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer , and took the goat ’ s head on his knees
0	here another soldier came up , crying , --
0	ly , as he was very fond of snuff , he found the presence of m madeleine an advantage , in that he used three times as much as he had done previously , and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner , seeing that m madeleine paid for it
0	it may have lasted a long time
0	marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed
0	they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause
0	who said that you were to go away ?
0	these works are superposed one upon the other
0	to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion , to hold above the gulf , were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would , otherwise , be lost , that is to say , one of the elements , good or bad , of which civilization is composed , or by which it is complicated , to extend the records of social observation ; is to serve civilization itself
0	you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little waiting-room
0	quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start
0	the lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door of no
0	the visit took place
0	as she swept up she remarked to him : -possibly monsieur may have heard some one come in last night ?
0	to a glazier , for the windows of the said chamber , forty-six sols , eight deniers parisis
0	are you sure that she will come ?
0	she seized the thenardier 's hand , looked at her fixedly , and said : -will you keep my child for me ?
0	this little cell had been celebrated in paris for nearly three centuries , ever since madame rolande de la tour-roland , in mourning for her father who died in the crusades , had caused it to be hollowed out in the wall of her own house , in order to immure herself there forever , keeping of all her palace only this lodging whose door was walled up , and whose window stood open , winter and summer , giving all the rest to the poor and to god
0	these men are terrible , when one encounters them , or catches a glimpse of them , towards midnight , on a deserted boulevard
0	love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man and the woman takes place ; the being one , the being triple , the being final , the human trinity proceeds from it
0	she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out , shutting the door behind her
0	these good old women were fond of begging
0	you have here enough grotesque specimens of both sexes , to allow of laughing in flemish fashion , and there are enough of us ugly in countenance to hope for a fine grinning match
0	monseigneur , said rennet , do you call that a woman ?
0	jean valjean grasped her , put her on his back , took her two tiny hands in his large left hand , lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant
0	how you gaze at that officer !
0	tell me , monsieur thenardier , is what we have done permissible ?
0	it seems that on the night succeeding the interment , feeble voices were heard calling from the well
0	these candlesticks held two wax candles , and usually figured on the bishop 's chimney-piece
0	jean valjean recognized the difficulty
0	the jackal 's four paws suit some actions
0	but what do those thenardiers mean by keeping my cosette from me !
0	an escarpment rose around him
0	i was told that i had lost my reason , and that jean valjean is at arras , in the power of the authorities
0	listen , exclaimed quasimodo , thinking to overcome his hesitation with a word , come , monseigneur !
0	although he expected no resistance , he wished , like a prudent general , to preserve an order which would permit him to face , at need , a sudden attack of the watch or the police
0	jean , if you like
0	if wellington had not begun , blucher could not have finished
0	to traverse the same road ?
0	there exists yonder in the mountains , said the bishop , a tiny community no bigger than that , which i have not seen for three years
0	the majority of them , when talking freely , did justice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution ; no one hated him
0	uproar reigns in front , tumult behind
0	all these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of bees
0	it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms ; then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him , stealthily approached the unfortunate man , put a piece of money into his hand , often a silver coin , and walked rapidly away
0	now get out of the scrape yourself
0	he had some natural wit ; he talked good grammar ; he conversed , which is a rare thing in a village ; and the other peasants said of him : he talks almost like a gentleman with a hat
0	napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been decided on
0	nor yet that of louis xvi
0	phoebus counted the coins , and turning towards jehan with solemnity , do you know , jehan , that there are three and twenty sous parisis !
0	they generally succeed the bad ones , as day follows night , by virtue of that law of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature , and which superficial minds call antithesis
0	notre-dame de paris is not of pure romanesque , like the first ; nor of pure arabian race , like the second
0	what is to be done in such a case ?
0	the devil may pass through it , but the good god dwells here
0	i do not know how to explain ; i have no education ; i am a poor man ; that is where they wrong me , because they do not see this
0	one can not go barefoot to the good god , he added bitterly
0	come then , i will go on horseback
0	he thought of his father 's sword , which his grandfather had sold to a second-hand dealer , and which he had so mournfully regretted
0	all at once fantine raised her eyes , saw him , and made m madeleine turn round
0	here cosette lost ground a little
0	well , so it was the cross that he wanted !
0	the archdeacon hesitated for a moment , then he allowed a gloomy smile to escape , which seemed to give the lie to his response : _credo in deum_
0	algebra is applied to the clouds ; the radiation of the star profits the rose ; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations
0	he did what he liked with him
0	an hour or two later he waked again
0	this was no infidelity to cosette ; it was a gentle and pensive farewell to an unhappy soul
0	the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date : their fathers in the flesh had been , either royalists , doctrinaires , it matters not what ; this confusion anterior to themselves , who were young , did not concern them at all ; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins
0	it was the street boy turned pickpocket , and a pickpocket turned garroter
0	while the palais bourbon , that wretched edifice , is being repaired at great expense , gusts of wind and equinoctial storms are allowed to destroy the magnificent painted windows of the sainte-chapelle
0	jean valjean stammered : how stupid people are !
0	the five chosen men left the barricade by way of mondetour lane ; they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the national guard
0	the complaint says _tunicam_ and not _cappettam_
0	can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness , as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault ?
0	people go there on pleasure parties in summer
0	then , turning to the gendarmes : -you may retire , gentlemen
0	they are already sufficiently detached from religion to think of their beauty , to take care of it , to correct without relaxation their parure of statues or arabesques
0	in number the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body , emboldened by catastrophe , possessed only traits which aroused indignation
0	am not i dreaming ?
0	all that darkness did not trouble for a moment the light of that immense eye before which a grub skipping from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to belfry on the towers of notre dame
0	this was the last drop of anguish
0	the archdeacon , as though roused with a start , withheld his arm with convulsive violence
0	fantine , as we shall see , had the fierce bravery of life
0	but in three days justice will reclaim her , and she will be hanged on the grève
0	come , he 's dead , completely dead
0	the impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind
0	apoplexy is no longer to be feared , but phthisis is there
0	all were the direct sons of the french revolution
0	for the last hour , that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement , the uproar of a fly in a bottle
0	tis a big fire
0	within was a large whitewashed room , with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff , and a cradle in one corner , a few wooden chairs , and a double-barrelled gun hanging on the wall
0	an inward growth seemed to be in progress within him
0	a spy of the first quality , who had observed everything , listened to everything , and taken in everything , even when he thought that he was to die ; who had played the spy even in his agony , and who , with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre , had taken notes
0	here , catch hold of my hand
0	marius ' two arms were passed round his neck , and the former 's feet dragged behind him
0	it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words
0	two things were left on his hands , an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine , and a consolation , the fifteen hundred francs
0	citizens , pursued enjolras , this is the republic , and universal suffrage reigns
0	a great matter , truly
0	not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections
0	i do not understand
0	however , and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject , the prosperity of m sur m vanished with m madeleine ; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized ; lacking him , there actually was a soul lacking
0	those who had no ladders had knotted ropes ; those who had no ropes climbed by the projections of the carvings
0	nevertheless , i sent madame magloire down a moment later , to carry to the man 's bed a goat skin from the black forest , which was in my room
0	it is you , father !
0	none the less , he had set two men to chattering : the porter , in the convent , and he knew the singularities of their parlor , and the grave-digger , at the cemetery , and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture ; in this way , he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns , one as to their life , the other as to their death
0	all the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth
0	more than once the laundress of the terrain charged with washing the chapter had observed , not without affright , the marks of nails and clenched fingers on the surplice of monsieur the archdeacon of josas
0	is it not a horrible caprice ?
0	m gillenormand took his seat
0	she had besides , more than formerly , in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness
0	when the boatman had taken his departure , he remained standing stupidly on the strand , staring straight before him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations which rendered everything a sort of phantasmagoria to him
0	jean valjean is certainly dead , said he , and i am a ninny
0	on the first encounter , and to one who saw him for the first time , he was nothing , in fact , but a fine man
0	but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance , and which transfigured her in her sleep
0	their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes , into nice little promotions
0	it was jean valjean
0	when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil , and so far from suspecting anything !
0	well , said javert , where is he ?
0	she interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes
0	there is visible labor and invisible labor
0	she felt the conflagration starting up once more
0	if he only would return , what a good box on the ear i would give him !
0	some one , a person to whom one replies not , took the responsibility on himself
0	said fleur-de-lys hastily to the captain
0	it must have been on the boulevard ?
0	the pope of the fools had been elected
0	he was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings , and he was fully entered on optimism
0	that was his way , however
0	then he interrupted himself and addressed me : -have we not some relatives in those parts , my dear sister ?
0	and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty , he added : -a lass
0	all at once he smote his brow
0	here i am concealed , no one knows that i am here
0	monsieur the bailiff is our friend
0	no woman was admitted to this back room , except louison , the dish-washer of the cafe , who passed through it from time to time , to go to her washing in the lavatory
0	brujon remained silent an instant longer , then he shook his head in various ways , and finally concluded to speak : -see here ; this morning i came across two sparrows fighting , this evening i jostled a woman who was quarrelling
0	after the series of fatal shocks which had overturned everything within her , she had found but one thing intact in her soul , one sentiment , -- her love for the captain
0	the man turned round from time to time , and looked to see if he was being followed
0	the two children drew close to gavroche
0	then he cried : vae victis !
0	he rifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger
0	javert committed all these blunders , and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed
0	he said , after examining the object ; found , apparently , on the banks of the river phlegethon
0	how stupid they are !
0	there are marvellous relations between beings and things ; in that inexhaustible whole , from the sun to the grub , nothing despises the other ; all have need of each other
0	let the reader imagine paris lifted off like a cover , the subterranean net-work of sewers , from a bird 's eye view , will outline on the banks a species of large branch grafted on the river
0	esmeralda began to crumble some bread , which djali ate gracefully from the hollow of her hand
0	i must be there this evening
0	the man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there
0	then it is not true , resumed coictier hotly , that gout is an internal eruption ; that a wound caused by artillery is to be cured by the application of a young mouse roasted ; that young blood , properly injected , restores youth to aged veins ; it is not true that two and two make four , and that emprostathonos follows opistathonos
0	to all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described , -- neither english nor french , neither peasant nor soldier , less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory , and come to rifle waterloo
0	jean valjean found not a word to answer
0	he threw himself flat on his face , and crawled into the hut
0	thus defiled by fours , with the divers insignia of their grades , in that strange faculty , most of them lame , some cripples , others one-armed , shop clerks , pilgrim , _hubins_ , bootblacks , thimble-riggers , street arabs , beggars , the blear-eyed beggars , thieves , the weakly , vagabonds , merchants , sham soldiers , goldsmiths , passed masters of pickpockets , isolated thieves
0	you are benumbed , said fauchelevent
0	what had become of that man , that mysterious man , whom the coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious marius , and whom the police-agent on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent ?
0	the constitutionnel was constitutionalla minerve called chateaubriand chateaubriant
0	the female vagabonds did not seem to be much affected by the proposition
0	children who contrive to be beautiful and contented , -- that intoxicates me
0	the soldiers against alexander , the sailors against christopher columbus , -- this is the same revolt ; impious revolt ; why ?
0	hence he made haste to draw near the bonfire , which was burning magnificently in the middle of the place
0	readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble
0	the public ministry of the day proved its indefatigable zeal in the defence of society , in this instance
0	her dress thick set with spangles , blue , and dotted with a thousand sparks , gleamed like a summer night
0	i will pay whatever you ask
0	she wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her : you are a little goose
0	i think that would be better , replied marius coldly
0	his first sensation was one of blindness
0	i left the door unlocked expressly ; enter master jacques !
0	moreover , he had his hat in his hand , although it had been raining all the morning , and was raining pretty briskly at the very time
0	two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray , and suspended under them like a stirrup , which supported their feet
0	and henceforth , if architecture should arise again accidentally , it will no longer be mistress
0	one would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe
0	they remained motionless in that cavern , in that night , beneath that beam , almost hanging , forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread , jug , or their vault overhead , mud even to mid-leg , filth flowing to their very calves , broken asunder with fatigue , with thighs and knees giving way , clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some rest , unable to sleep except when standing erect , and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar ; some woke no more
0	for the spectator who arrived , panting , upon that pinnacle , it was first a dazzling confusing view of roofs , chimneys , streets , bridges , places , spires , bell towers
0	tristan l ’ hermite bowed and departed
0	that poor brat , i remember , and i seem to see him now , when he lay nude on the dissecting table , how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery
0	you certainly do not seem to me to be ill monsieur , replied the old man , i am going to recover
0	in the elephant , said gavroche
0	i did nothing ; i said to myself , the gentleman is amusing himself
0	gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor , and placed it against one of the elephant 's forelegs
0	when a man is as much in love as a tiger , the least that he can do is to fight like a lion
0	he assumed that it could be no one but he
0	say , where do you live now ?
0	then , while she still kept her eyes closed , she heard a rough voice saying , very gently , --
0	but the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic
0	it wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred , ruin
0	the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there
0	then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette
0	he gave it up to listen
0	he raised his head
0	you do not belong in these parts ?
0	during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the south
0	i am no longer surprised , added gervaise , that fear of the gypsies should spur you on so sharply
0	the porter did not stir
0	the servant informed sister simplice in a very low tone , that the mayor had set out that morning before six o'clock , in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse , cold as the weather was ; that he had gone alone , without even a driver ; that no one knew what road he had taken ; that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to arras ; that others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris
0	there was no waste of useless powder
0	these recovered chapters will possess no doubt , but little value in the eyes of persons , otherwise very judicious , who have sought in notre-dame-de-paris only the drama , the romance
0	these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior
0	on the other hand , he remained as simple as on the first day
0	to the cross-bar of the window , added brujon
0	in the central portion of the front of this building , on the rue droit-mur side , there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead
0	he glanced at the cloud
0	chance had , unfortunately , favored the brave deaf man
0	in an instant they had become good friends
0	the president , an attentive and benevolent man , raised his voice
0	fragments which had fallen from the elephant 's back into his belly had filled up the cavity , so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor
0	what you beheld was the interior of a cloister
0	jean valjean took fantine 's head in both his hands , and arranged it on the pillow as a mother might have done for her child ; then he tied the string of her chemise , and smoothed her hair back under her cap
0	what you say is astonishing !
0	he is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict
0	there is no jacquerie ; society may rest assured on that point ; blood will no longer rush to its head
0	he lived without disdain
0	are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going ?
0	one remained , however , and from this intrenchment , the last resource of monseigneur bienvenu 's resistance , came forth this reply , wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning : -progress should believe in god
0	moreover , he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction , by superstition , despotism , and prejudice
0	the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep
0	in the majority of cases , riot proceeds from a material fact ; insurrection is always a moral phenomenon
0	because the convent , which is common to the orient as well as to the occident , to antiquity as well as to modern times , to paganism , to buddhism , to mahometanism , as well as to christianity , is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the infinite
0	her mother became more crazy over her every day
0	then half-turning in his chair , placing his hands on his knees , and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face , which so easily grew joyous , and which was illuminated from below by the firelight , -- come , what is the matter ?
0	he took the arm of the priest , who let him have his way , and made him enter the staircase turret of for-l ’ evêque
0	the taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity
0	feeling that he was not beloved , he did not love
0	birds flew about in it with cries of joy
0	how far it is from the epoch when robert cenalis , comparing notre-dame de paris to the famous temple of diana at ephesus , so much lauded by the ancient pagans , which erostatus has immortalized , found the gallic temple more excellent in length , breadth , height , and structure
0	provided that you are wholly cured , my phoebus !
0	the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which he is buried , is a sort of glacial chastity , and he calls the dungeon the castus
0	his life had been all shadows , his end was night
0	it might be asked : who built this ?
0	i came to watch you sleep
0	by the mercy of the devil , retorted joannes frollo , these four hours and more ; and i hope that they will be reckoned to my credit in purgatory
0	retorted the man ; a corner of the loft then , a truss of straw
0	when he passed through a village , the ragged brats ran joyously after him , and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats
0	thenardier replied respectfully : -it means , sir , that i shall take back cosette
0	at length one of these , as fat , short , and venerable as himself , came to his rescue
0	grantaire , demanded laigle , have you just come from the boulevard ?
0	here a remark becomes necessary
0	if she were older , she might earn her living ; but it can not be done at that age
0	she was still young ; she was barely thirty
0	the mother , whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy , and was coming on well , submitted , and forwarded the twelve francs
0	your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention
0	the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken ; another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy
0	and not only could he not deny it , but he had taken part in it
0	what is to become of you ?
0	i was a woman of the town , i had a child , they took my child
0	he had only been waiting for this opportunity
0	true history being a mixture of all things , the true historian mingles in everything
0	it was she who placed this little bag about my neck
0	and they parted , montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the greve , and gavroche towards the bastille
0	and then , when , after a day spent in meditation , he returned in the evening through the boulevards , and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond , the nameless gleams , the abyss , the shadow , the mystery , all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to him
0	she died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death , and who say : no one shall have him !
0	to mention the name was to deliver the whole affair into their hands , and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing
0	i desire to forget life
0	yes , brother claude ; but that accursed seigneury of poligny , which people make so much noise about , is worth not sixty gold crowns , year out and year in
0	to die in a butt of malvoisie , like clarence , is permissible ; in the ditch of a scavenger , like escoubleau , is horrible
0	theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying ; but he was much touched by the ten louis , and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel
0	the glass must be violet for iron jewellery , and black for gold jewellery
0	the five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs
0	at that moment , a ferocious growl became audible
0	this communicates with the abyss
0	a change awaited him there
0	she told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question in the book , and she would answer it
0	at issy an incident occurredthe truly national park , at that time owned by bourguin the contractor , happened to be wide open
0	but in order to do this , he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings
0	these sudden congealments in the state of revery , which a single word suffices to evoke , do occur
0	o fantine , know this : i , tholomyes , i am all illusion ; but she does not even hear me , that blond maid of chimeras !
0	that is what i do know !
0	i said to myself : blockhead !
0	a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
0	it was lucky that he did so , for , on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing , jondrette turned round , made sure that no one was following him , did not see him , then sprang across the wall and disappeared
0	it was one of those intermissions which frequently occur in nocturnal combats , which are always followed by an increase of rage
0	the moon , which had just risen behind her , cast cosette 's shadow in front of her upon this lawn , as she came out from the shrubbery
0	chateaubriand , had he entered there , would have produced the effect of pere duchene
0	she inquired of toussaint : -has my father returned yet ?
0	the moon had risen
0	as for the noise , it was like the inside of a bell at full peal
0	jehan made him a deep bow , and descended the cloister stairs , whistling
0	oudarde , a big and tender woman , would have been well pleased to sigh in company with mahiette
0	it will be remembered , that at the battle of inkermann a sergeant who had , it appears , saved the army , could not be mentioned by lord paglan , as the english military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports
0	one weakness coming to the aid of another !
0	the same silence ; the same immobility
0	let us think only of that which threatens our soul
0	the other replied indifferently , --
0	the loss in officers was considerable
0	without stopping his song , the lad halted in his march from time to time , and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand -- his whole fortune , probably
0	the goat was undoubtedly the devil
0	the bernardines-benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their order
0	one was twenty-five years old , the other twenty-three
0	in paris , for example , independently of the hundred and forty-one lords who laid claim to a manor , there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice , from the bishop of paris , who had five hundred streets , to the prior of notre-dame des champs , who had four
0	with his first shot he had saved gavroche , and with the second delivered courfeyrac
0	it is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes , but no longer sight
0	a passably large air-hole , probably the man-hole in the rue d'anjou , furnished a light that was almost vivid
0	a minute later , i feel in my pocket
0	i shall come to fetch you
0	how much have you ?
0	mr president , have me arrested
0	all this took place in the twinkling of an eye
0	you , in complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in this suit , during the night of the twenty-ninth of march last , murdered and stabbed , in concert with the powers of darkness , by the aid of charms and underhand practices , a captain of the king ’ s arches of the watch , phoebus de châteaupers
0	for a condemned man , a mask is not a mask , it is a shelter
0	and it was necessary to decide on the instant , to devise some expedient , to come to some decision
0	the two extremities of this gigantic parallelogram were occupied , the one by the famous marble table , so long , so broad , and so thick that , as the ancient land rolls -- in a style that would have given gargantua an appetite -- say , such a slice of marble as was never beheld in the world ; the other by the chapel where louis xi
0	they had been to vernon
0	the butcher refuses to give credit ; he will not let us have any more meat
0	to tell the whole , however , she also felt , from time to time , in that cesspool of mire and darkness , something cold passing over her foot or her arm , and she shuddered
0	no tongue can express all that lay in that word , woman , thus pronounced by that child
0	she belonged to the society of the virgin , wore a white veil on certain festivals , mumbled special orisons , revered the holy blood , venerated the sacred heart , remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful , and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble , and through great rays of gilded wood
0	by the way , there ’ s the rector !
0	in this manner he could see all that went on in the adjoining room
0	morality is a blossoming out of truths
0	the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets , so that where there was not a light , there was a flower
0	this elicited an exclamation from the workers
0	one sweet idea alone was left to him , that she had loved him , that her glance had told him so , that she did not know his name , but that she did know his soul , and that , wherever she was , however mysterious the place , she still loved him perhaps
0	the bourgeoisie loves tragedy , and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score
0	was it you who told basque not to make a fire then ?
0	from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure
0	he continued : -chenildieu , you who conferred on yourself the name of jenie-dieu , your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn , because you one day laid your shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals , in order to efface the three letters t f p , which are still visible , nevertheless ; answer , is this true ?
0	this was tempting , and courfeyrac could not resist
0	fleur-de-lys replied to the captain with a bland affectation of disdain ; -- not bad
0	this produced a lightening of the cloud , then the cloud became black once more
0	in the rue de thorigny , all was peace and silence
0	the stone was there
0	while these two men were manoeuvring , each on his own side , with irreproachable strategy , they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore , and which permitted cab-drivers arriving from passy to come to the river and water their horses
0	marius ' silence answered for him
0	however , the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the hospitallers
0	to be hungry , to be thirsty -- that is the point of departure ; to be satan -- that is the point reached
0	nothing to be made there
0	it is the moment when the sun , already declining towards the west , looks the cathedral almost full in the face
0	yes , they would have hanged it
0	paris knew , in a confused way , that she had under her a terrible cavern
0	it was pitch dark
0	in summer , we will go to the glaciere with navet , one of my pals , we will bathe in the gare , we will run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at austerlitz , -- that makes the laundresses raging
0	proceeding from circuit to circuit , he reached a lane which he judged to be the rue de la poterie ; near the middle of this street , he came in contact with an obstacle
0	the bishop embraced him , and at the moment when the knife was about to fall , he said to him : god raises from the dead him whom man slays ; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more
0	i do not love it ; but it benumbs the senses
0	toussaint 's bed was despoiled in like manner
0	forty-three balusters can still be counted on their sockets ; the rest lie prostrate in the grass
0	she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good
0	he cried , do not you see that that jade is walking off !
0	one day he stopped at the corner of the rue culture-sainte-catherine and looked at the rue des filles-du-calvaire from a distance
0	well , jehan , stammered the elder brother with an effort , what is the meaning of yonder word ?
0	the old man resumed with a half-smile in that case , you are my bishop ?
0	i ask you where are you going , you villain ?
0	otherwise , he was the gayest of them all
0	despair , also , has its ecstasy
0	the fishwoman of dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of euripides , the discobols vejanus lives again in the forioso , the tight-rope dancer
0	what has mademoiselle euphrasie to do with the question ?
0	who is this with you ?
0	it is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice
0	a moment later , the riot approaches and gains in force , he shuts up his shop precipitately , hastily dons his uniform , that is to say , he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person
0	and he added : there will be a funeral here to-morrow
0	goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall , in secluded nooks of the forest , a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper , wearing wooden shoes , clad in trousers and a blouse of linen , and recognizable by the fact , that , instead of a cap or hat , he has two immense horns on his head
0	under this reign of splendid matter , the ideal had received the strange name of ideology !
0	a gust of fetidness informed him of the place in which he stood
0	monsieur le maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that i own
0	tis fine to be the man
0	from time to time , this noise and clamor redoubled ; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards , became troubled , formed whirlpools
0	one really must behold the grimace of an honest man above the hempen collar now and then ; that renders the thing honorable
0	they had told each other everything except everything
0	there , they are going now , thought he
0	four-four was madame de genlis 's signal
0	aide-de-camp bernard carried them the emperor 's orders
0	he was over a hundred years old
0	what do you call that woman ?
0	it was supposed that flamel had buried the philosopher ’ s stone in the cellar ; and the alchemists , for the space of two centuries , from magistri to father pacifique , never ceased to worry the soil until the house , so cruelly ransacked and turned over , ended by falling into dust beneath their feet
0	but to come to the point , how the deuce did you manage to get in here , you , father madeleine ?
0	then the king , dismissing rym and coppenole with a gesture , --
0	this surname furnished my name
0	we regret that we are not able to offer to our readers this remarkable piece
0	when thou readest this , my soul will be near thee
0	i can imagine it
0	of these divers places he is voyer , high , middle , and low , justiciary , full seigneur
0	it is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas , than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts , and we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress , which brought the orient and the occident face to face one fine day , in the depths of a sepulchre , and made the imaums converse with bonaparte in the interior of the great pyramid
0	it was almost dark
0	how was he to get out ?
0	beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police , recognizable by their black costume and their awkwardness in the saddle
0	go and amuse yourself
0	he lived with irony
0	did i have a father and mother ?
0	master joachim de ladehors !
0	an instant later she returned and whispered in his ear : -'tis done
0	he is the one they called marius
0	there was a chair behind him ; he dropped into it , terrified at the thought that he might be seen ; when he was seated , he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes , which stood on the judge 's desk , to conceal his face from the whole room ; he could now see without being seen ; he had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things ; gradually he recovered ; he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen
0	the charming madame de leon , in memory , no doubt , of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse , preferred this appellation to her title of princesse
0	he asked cosette : -would you like to come to the luxembourg ?
0	do not speak to me of him
0	besides , had he not said : let me never hear the name of that blood-drinker again !
0	she had passed a very bad night ; her cough was frightful ; her fever had doubled in intensity ; she had had dreams : in the morning , when the doctor paid his visit , she was delirious ; he assumed an alarmed look , and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m madeleine arrived
0	there was a stone bench in one corner , one or two mouldy statues , several lattices which had lost their nails with time , were rotting on the wall , and there were no walks nor turf ; but there was enough grass everywhere
0	what has become of my phoebus ?
0	the good god consulted his note-book which shows when the time is up
0	at three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian , and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror
0	it lasted for some time on the quay ; then it gradually ceased , as though that which was passing were entering the interior of the island ; then it stopped altogether , and the line of the quay became straight and motionless again
0	now she and you form but one for me
0	he was poor , but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible
0	england had him guarded by hudson lowe , and france had him watched by montchenu
0	this is what had taken place that same night at the la force : -an escape had been planned between babet , brujon , guelemer , and thenardier , although thenardier was in close confinement
0	in his youth , their visits are lugubrious ; later on they are sinister
0	after bidding his sister good night , monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table , handed the other to his guest , and said to him , -monsieur , i will conduct you to your room
0	nevertheless , we are sparing nothing for the sake of getting at the truth ; he is already thoroughly dislocated , we are applying all the herbs of saint john ’ s day ; as saith the old comedian plautus , --
0	he had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his diogenes laertius every night , before he went to bed
0	we have seen very fine criminals there , who have killed their father and mother !
0	the instinct of his own lofty intellect made him recognize an intellect no less lofty under gossip tourangeau ’ s furred cap , and as he gazed at the solemn face , the ironical smile which jacques coictier ’ s presence called forth on his gloomy face , gradually disappeared as twilight fades on the horizon of night
0	this is what floats up confusedly , pell-mell , for the year number , and is now forgotten
0	i want to know it
0	already half fascinated , i tried to cling fast to something and hold myself back from falling
0	he went to the window , threw it wide open as though he were stifling , and , erect before the darkness , he began to talk into the street , to the night : pierced , sabred , exterminated , slashed , hacked in pieces !
0	after all , he ’ s mad
0	no one doubted but that the day had come when , in accordance with their compact , quasimodo , that is to say , the devil , was to carry off claude frollo , that is to say , the sorcerer
0	many men have a secret monster in this same manner , a dragon which gnaws them , a despair which inhabits their night
0	he had reduced his breakfast to two eggs , and he left one of these for his old servant , to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months
0	marius paid no heed to these symptoms
0	one is not a class because one has committed a fault
0	handing in one 's resignation is honorable
0	in those days of brilliancy , warmth , and serenity , there is a certain hour above all others , when the façade of notre-dame should be admired
0	fauntleroy , alias bouquetiere ( the flower girl )
0	i do not know , replied basque , intimidated and put out of countenance by his master 's air ; i have not seen him
0	the poor bellringer seemed to have disappeared from the church
0	joie est mon caractere , joy is my character , c'est la faute a voltaire ; 't is the fault of voltaire ; misere est mon trousseau , misery is my trousseau , c'est la faute a rousseau
0	because it is a gewgaw
0	evil has no right to exist
0	at that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man
0	sister simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the factory , whether the mayor had returned , and if he would not come to the infirmary soon
0	all at once , the thenardier exclaimed : -by the way , where 's that bread ?
0	four feet of river flow past along the outside wall
0	gracious , replied the child , we have no lodging
0	towards the end of the restoration , these same passers-by might have noticed that the bill had disappeared , and even that the shutters on the first floor were open
0	as he passed the rue de la huchette , the odor of those admirable spits , which were incessantly turning , tickled his olfactory apparatus , and he bestowed a loving glance toward the cyclopean roast , which one day drew from the franciscan friar , calatagirone , this pathetic exclamation : _veramente , queste rotisserie sono cosa stupenda_ !
0	it was hither that he had come every time that m gillenormand had said : he is sleeping out
0	his eye never quitted the old man
0	it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him , thinking him more useful in the charlemagne yard than in close confinement
0	he caught glimpses of everything , but he saw nothing
0	it had diffused over the earth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light
0	he tore the gypsy from the arms of the dazed quasimodo , threw her across his saddle , and at the moment when the terrible hunchback , recovering from his surprise , rushed upon him to regain his prey , fifteen or sixteen archers , who followed their captain closely , made their appearance , with their two-edged swords in their fists
0	a number of batteries lay unhorsed
0	why was he hastening ?
0	the address ran : to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint-jacquesdu-haut-pas
0	in addition , many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth
0	you saw the flemings yesterday ; you must see the gypsy to-day
0	while dreaming and chattering , making tiny outfits , and baby clothes , while sewing little gowns , and corsages and bodices , the child grows into a young girl , the young girl into a big girl , the big girl into a woman
0	a stir began distinctly in the saint-leu quarter , but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack
0	before them two squares , behind them somerset ; somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard
0	but nothing could induce marius to talk
0	kings are like the jupiter of crete , they have ears only in their feet
0	we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable ; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original
0	this is the grève
0	then bankruptcy had come ; and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse , and neither family nor children , he had turned carter
0	at times , jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile
0	bossuet had not much domicile , sometimes none at all
0	she had eyes larger than her mouth , and the most charming black hair , which already curled
0	the one who answered to the name of patagon clapped her hands together in horror
0	i am uncomfortable against this post , replied javert
0	all this took place a few paces distant from gavroche
0	it was a city formed of two layers only ; the romanesque layer and the gothic layer ; for the roman layer had disappeared long before , with the exception of the hot baths of julian , where it still pierced through the thick crust of the middle ages
0	ought he to turn to the left or to the right ?
0	moreover , the principle is , that in order to get the best of a wild boar , one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs
0	at work , at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan , jean valjean was worth four men
0	marius breathed freely in courfeyrac 's society , a decidedly new thing for him
0	they were not published in the preceding editions of the book for a very simple reason
0	how could she make such nails work ?
0	gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge , then suddenly paused
0	i am not pleased with you , replied the portress
0	meanwhile the carriage rolled on
0	the captain rose to please her , chiding her with a smile of satisfaction , --
0	that 's the way the affair should be treated
0	what have i done to you ?
0	fantine had been at the factory for more than a year , when , one morning , the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor , told her that she was no longer employed in the shop , and requested her , in the mayor 's name , to leave the neighborhood
0	i did not want them to take to the theatre
0	i know what you wish to say to me
0	in such games soldiers are aces
0	seventhly : for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weaving shop ; this is an abuse of the contractor , since the cloth is none the worse for it
0	there was the same writing , the same style , the same orthography , the same paper , the same odor of tobacco
0	pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua , melas , and alexandria , mack at ulm , made prisoners in succession
0	when a nun is summoned to the parlor , even were it the prioress herself , she drops her veil , as will be remembered , so that only her mouth is visible
0	all the beautiful black copes !
0	the aunt examined the paper , turned it about in all directions , then put it back in its case
0	perhaps that was the one
0	in the lesser arm lay the kitchens , the refectory , backed up by the cloisters and the church
0	i have no clothes
0	how well i remember that !
0	evening came , she thought the night so beautiful that she made the circuit of the elevated gallery which surrounds the church
0	there are six of you , what matters that to me ?
0	let us be calm , young 'uns
0	the first street that i entered was deserted
0	she , no less pale , no less like a statue , had hardly noticed that they had placed in her hand a heavy , lighted candle of yellow wax ; she had not heard the yelping voice of the clerk reading the fatal contents of the apology ; when they told her to respond with amen , she responded amen
0	six times seven makes forty-two , said the thenardier
0	even before he had crossed the threshold , he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand , and on catching sight of him , the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing : -well !
0	you shall have the address
0	god 's whole policy consists in rendering slopes less steep
0	they raised her , she fell back again
0	after all , what was a miserable dancer on the public squares in the presence of these high-born maidens ?
0	perchance she is deaf , said oudarde
0	revolt , as we have said , is sometimes found among those in power
0	then he added : perhaps my thoughts reach her also
0	after all , nature was not dumb in the poor fellow , and his human sensibility , all maliciously contorted as it was , quivered no less than any other
0	she approached the table
0	uproar in the hive ; the vocal-mothers were all in a flutter ; madame de genlis had made romances
0	all precipitated themselves thither
0	the man in black did not allow him to finish
0	and if there should come a gust of wind ?
0	her feet were bare
0	he asked the first person whom be met for m pontmercy 's house
0	excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself , but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me , alas !
0	she replied , quickly , tis my guardian
0	in the midst of this round table of beggary , clopin trouillefou , -- as the doge of this senate , as the king of this peerage , as the pope of this conclave , -- dominated ; first by virtue of the height of his hogshead , and next by virtue of an indescribable , haughty , fierce , and formidable air , which caused his eyes to flash , and corrected in his savage profile the bestial type of the race of vagabonds
0	every one who was left in the hall flew to the windows , climbing the walls in order to see , and repeating , la esmeralda !
0	if he had a mistress , he speedily discovered that he had a friend also
0	revolt , as we have said , is sometimes found among those in power
0	jean prouvaire and combeferre pressed each other 's hands silently , and , leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade , they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion , that grave young man , executioner and priest , composed of light , like crystal , and also of rock
0	on the second floor were the lodgings of the hucheloup family
0	in the next place , he was so hard of hearing that he did not catch a single word of what the clerk said to him ; nevertheless , he wished to have the appearance of hearing , and replied , ah !
0	it is this peril , possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth century , which the french revolution , that immense act of probity , cut short
0	what is the meaning of this , sir ?
0	economically considered , the matter can be summed up thus : paris is a spendthrift
0	then turning to the three masked men , he said to the man with the meat-axe : -good day , gueulemer !
0	if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views , a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power
0	folly began to bring her in no more than her trade of embroidery in former days ; for every wrinkle that came , a crown fled ; winter became hard to her once more , wood became rare again in her brazier , and bread in her cupboard
0	he was beside himself with love
0	you are in luck , that you are , joly was saying
0	he raised his head and recognized eponine
0	utopia , moreover , we must admit , quits its radiant sphere when it makes war
0	but you will not find one for sale nor to let , for five hundred francs , or for a thousand
0	he said in a dull voice
0	but i may whisper it among friends
0	society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels
0	i have rendered you service on various occasions
0	come , make haste , said the king , stamping upon his cask , which resounded like a huge drum !
0	the church in the street , the church which any one can enter
0	he created at his own expense an infant school , a thing then almost unknown in france , and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen
0	now , said thenardier , search him , you other fellows !
0	a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance
0	the two children followed close on his heels
0	moreover , cosette could not remember what marius had said to heron the subject of this absence which was to last only one day , and what explanation of it he had given her
0	nevertheless , in the society into which his grandfather took him , whispers , innuendoes , and winks , had eventually enlightened the little boy 's mind ; he had finally understood something of the case , and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were , so to speak , the air he breathed , by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration , he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart
0	the past has a visage , superstition , and a mask , hypocrisy
0	but we doubt whether he had thought of suicide , an irreligious act
0	he was a tremendous drinker to boot
0	the islet appeared to him in the shadow like a black mass , beyond the narrow strip of whitish water which separated him from it
0	she denied ; they insisted
0	four gossips were chatting in a doorway
0	quasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy ; but the archdeacon seemed to be out of the world at that moment
0	the ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men : among men geniuses are required , among events revolutions
0	the wicked skies punish good deeds
0	the costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the changer 's catalogue ; we copy : a coat of black cloth , trowsers of black wool , a silk waistcoat , boots and linen
0	why had he fled ?
0	then la beresina , then lutzen , bautzen , dresden , wachau , leipzig , and the defiles of gelenhausen ; then montmirail , chateau-thierry , craon , the banks of the marne , the banks of the aisne , and the redoubtable position of laon
0	he rose to his feet , hesitated still another moment , and listened ; all was quiet in the house ; then he walked straight ahead , with short steps , to the window , of which he caught a glimpse
0	applaud , citizens ! shouted the scholars
0	i shall run away with you
0	thenardier had failed , the inn was closed , and no one knew what had become of him
0	what sword cut was that ?
0	and the porter , raising his eyes , recognized marius
0	his only thought now was to finish as soon as possible
0	hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations
0	marius dashed out of the barricade , combeferre followed him
0	he had been a jack of all trades
0	would you like to have me carry your coffer for you ?
0	babylon violated lessens alexander , rome enchained lessens caesar , jerusalem murdered lessens titus , tyranny follows the tyrant
0	napoleon three-quarters of a league ; wellington , half a league ; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side
0	then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said : -throw that outside
0	i will do whatever you wish , and that cuts you short , imbecile !
0	in the course of a few moments he had experienced , almost simultaneously , almost intermingled with each other , all possible emotions
0	so , gringoire , you have never cherished envy for those handsome fellows in their military doublets ?
0	they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors , and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes
0	let us return to paris and to the fifteenth century
0	each branch may become a dynasty
0	paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water
0	meanwhile the king addressed him , from the summit of his cask , --
0	there was no one there
0	said the man , with surprise
0	all the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl 's soul
0	shall i , frail creature , never more behold the day ?
0	this bag exhaled a strong odor of camphor
0	be off with you , said jean valjean
0	so i have met you at last !
0	so there is something beyond duty ?
0	which constantly superposes itself , without a break , without a gap , upon the human race , which walks a monster with a thousand legs ? -- architecture or printing ?
0	all the people were staring and listening
0	her ears are not so long as his !
0	marius saluted jean valjean , happiness escorted despair to the door , and these two men parted
0	more than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient , padlocked gate , twisted , tottering , fastened to two green and moss-covered pillars , and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque
0	she was leaving that hated and hating house
0	there was not a single chair of any sort
0	marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from jondrette
0	this made the priest ’ s hollow eye flash
0	she tried to scream and could not
0	the rivalry would cease ; the future was beginning again
0	if it had not rained in the night between the numberth and the numberth of june , number , the fate of europe would have been different
0	he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years
0	thenardier resumed in his decided tone : -decamp , my girl , and leave men to their own affairs !
0	one puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel
0	then he laughed frightfully , and suddenly became pale again , when he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion , of that corrosive , venomous malignant , implacable love , which had ended only in the gibbet for one of them and in hell for the other ; condemnation for her , damnation for him
0	the fine lines of art give way to the cold and inexorable lines of geometry
0	benserade prepared us for it by some very gallant verses
0	my friend , he said to the stableman , is there a wheelwright here ?
0	what signified that disguise ?
0	on arriving there , he saw through the window a sergeant of police , and he entered
0	in this manner , the barricade , walled on three streets , in front on the rue de la chanvrerie , to the left on the rues du cygne and de la petite truanderie , to the right on the rue mondetour , was really almost impregnable ; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there
0	agamemnon , king of the heroes , flings to earth elatos , born in the rocky city which is laved by the sounding river satnois
0	nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh , expanding young souls
0	if he is not drunk , i shall say to him : come and drink a bout while the bon coing [ the good quince ] is open
0	gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paper folded in four
0	it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man ; but what could that signify ?
0	the witchcraft of which the captain had been the victim appeared irresistibly demonstrated , and in the eyes of all , the gypsy , that ravishing dancer , who had so often dazzled the passers-by with her grace , was no longer anything but a frightful vampire
0	she was at the age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily
0	each of these affirmations from these three men , evidently sincere and in good faith , had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the prisoner , -- a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding
0	the great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well-known points
0	moreover , no one guards a secret like a child
0	she repulsed him and clung to the sleeve of gringoire , who , in his turn , absorbed in the goat , almost repulsed her
0	we do not know whether he suddenly became conscious of these things ; but , giddy as he was , he understood that he had seen what he ought not to have seen , that he had just surprised the soul of his elder brother in one of its most secret altitudes , and that claude must not be allowed to know it
0	in the midst of this uproar , at the extremity of the tavern , on the bench inside the chimney , sat a philosopher meditating with his feet in the ashes and his eyes on the brands
0	you know well that people refuse me
0	she clapped her hands and exclaimed : -we have been looking everywhere for that !
0	you have to be knowing
0	marius ' first word had been : what is the matter ?
0	what have i done to you ?
0	the next day , at twilight , marius reached vernon
0	the strand of that island was its first boundary wall , the seine its first moat
0	otherwise , it is all over with you ; in a short time you will be among the gearing
0	for the first few moments , the deaf man paid no heed to him ; but at last he turned his head , and suddenly straightened up
0	on the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory , who is a virgin ?
0	i know not , replied the unhappy child ; but i am condemned to die
0	assuredly , this is an opera which it is worth the trouble of listening to
0	here he paused , the pen fell from his fingers , he was seized by one of those sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being ; the poor man clasped his head in both hands , and meditated
0	david d'angers was trying to work in marble
0	i have my suspicions of it , said jacques charmolue
0	in the fifteenth century , paris was still divided into three wholly distinct and separate towns , each having its own physiognomy , its own specialty , its manners , customs , privileges , and history : the city , the university , the town
0	that day , cosette 's glance drove marius beside himself , and marius ' glance set cosette to trembling
0	and then there was nothing more for the poor
0	a blank : an old french coin ; six blanks were worth two sous and a half ; targe , an ancient coin of burgundy , a farthing
0	the crowd grew more dense every moment , and , like water , which rises above its normal level , began to mount along the walls , to swell around the pillars , to spread out on the entablatures , on the cornices , on the window-sills , on all the salient points of the architecture , on all the reliefs of the sculpture
0	where are the arm-chairs ?
0	the truth is , that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied
0	she was always pressing her lips to them , and she could never recover from her amazement at their smallness
0	when the situation was not ripe , when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted , when the masses disowned the movement , all was over with the combatants , the city was changed into a desert around the revolt , souls grew chilled , refuges were nailed up , and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade
0	the inn-keeper 's wife came to the stable
0	there 's going to be a row
0	he is visible only to his waist
0	for our own part , we prefer martyrdom to success
0	if she had not had cosette , it is certain that her daughters , idolized as they were , would have received the whole of it ; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself
0	it is one half more than in the time of the brothers paclet , but it is not much
0	believe what i say to you
0	let us here emphasize one detail , he was not won over and was but little softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather
0	however , without any apparent object , he questioned cosette , who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing ; he talked of her childhood and her youth , and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good , paternal and respectable that a man can be towards cosette
0	the war of number , an outrage on the generous spanish nation , was then , at the same time , an outrage on the french revolution
0	she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison , and earned twelve sous a day
0	the kings reigned , but ill at their ease , with the rock of saint helena on the horizon
0	the boy surveyed her
0	when he made pontmercy 's acquaintance , this sympathy had existed between the colonel and himself -- that what the colonel did for flowers , he did for fruits
0	quasimodo vibrated with the bell
0	i think , said claude , that his name is phoebus de châteaupers
0	say all , say all !
0	what do i ask now ?
0	this time the man heard it
0	but you are good-natured princes , and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people , very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor
0	when she heard her husband 's step she turned over and said to him : -do you know , i am going to turn cosette out of doors to-morrow
0	laigle rubbed his hands
0	notre-dame de paris has not , like the abbey of tournus , the grave and massive frame , the large and round vault , the glacial bareness , the majestic simplicity of the edifices which have the rounded arch for their progenitor
0	let us come to an understanding
0	i am sure that you make cosette happy
0	the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it , with that air of enjoyment , rapture , and wrath , with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him , pass under his very nose
0	this seam took the form of a cross
0	three thousand cubic metres
0	and my lie , and my fraud and my indignity , and my cowardice and my treason and my crime , i should have drained drop by drop , i should have spit it out , then swallowed it again , i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday , and my good morning ' would have lied , and my good night ' would have lied , and i should have slept on it , i should have eaten it , with my bread , and i should have looked cosette in the face , and i should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul , and i should have been an abominable villain !
0	how do you know that my name is eponine ?
0	jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation , and , without voice , without breath , he stammered rather than said : now that you know , do you think , sir , you , who are the master , that i ought not to see cosette any more ?
0	monsieur , he said , turning towards one of his neighbors , a fine , big man , with a patient face , suppose we begin again
0	the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble , but did not shake the door
0	you can not imagine it ; the first time i saw her was at the luxembourg , she came there ; in the beginning , i did not pay much heed to her , and then , i do not know how it came about , i fell in love with her
0	there they are , or rather , there they exist , far from every eye , in the sweet light of may or june , kneeling round a hole in the ground , snapping marbles with their thumbs , quarrelling over half-farthings , irresponsible , volatile , free and happy ; and , no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry , and that they must earn their living , and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers , or a bunch of lilacs
0	she said at length
0	the leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations , italy and spain ; the one the light , the other the splendor of europe for centuries ; and , at the present day , these two illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce , thanks to the healthy and vigorous hygiene of number alone
0	he reflected that this man was his father , and that this man was dead , and a chill ran over him
0	the barricade was underneath it
0	do you know english ?
0	the peasant 's countenance assumed an expression of distrust ; he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet , and suddenly exclaimed , with a sort of shudder : -are you the man ? -- he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger , took three steps backwards , placed the lamp on the table , and took his gun down from the wall
0	an hour later , in the darkness of night , two men and a child presented themselves at no
0	this station lasts an hour
0	he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll , and in listening to her prattle
0	he raised his voice
0	it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else
0	what could that treasure of the centenarian be , which was so precious and so secret ?
0	he exclaimed with a laugh which laid bare all his teeth and made his face resemble the muzzle of a wolf , two mice in the trap !
0	it was into this house that jean valjean had , as fauchelevent expressed it , fallen from the sky
0	nevertheless , when the sun of the middle ages is completely set , when the gothic genius is forever extinct upon the horizon , architecture grows dim , loses its color , becomes more and more effaced
0	she had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground
0	here marius found the answer
0	the name of voltaire is known , but not the name of cesar de bus
0	as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property , the papers had been simple
0	marius had fallen into a wasps'-nest of wits
0	he yells loud enough to deafen a chanter , continued gauchère
0	only , continued clopin imperturbably , you will be hung later on , with more ceremony , at the expense of the good city of paris , on a handsome stone gibbet , and by honest men
0	said she , this is for that old fellow who goes to mass
0	some tardy stars were fading away at various points , and there was a very brilliant one in the east , in the brightest part of the heavens
0	her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin shoulder-blades
0	my wife and i occupy another
0	i would not say that in the moniteur , egad !
0	on the following day , m gillenormand said to his daughter : you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker , and you will never mention his name to me
0	when one is at the end of one 's life , to die means to go away ; when one is at the beginning of it , to go away means to die
0	he had imagined that m gillenormand had never loved him , and that that crusty , harsh , and smiling old fellow who cursed , shouted , and stormed and brandished his cane , cherished for him , at the most , only that affection , which is at once slight and severe , of the dotards of comedy
0	that is true , by the way , he replied , in the most natural tone possible
0	said gervaise , venturing to pass her head through the air-hole
0	let us return home , said the father , they are attacking the tuileries
0	we have seen that the country owed much to him ; the poor owed him everything ; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him
0	this monologue concluded , he turned to marius , and demanded , gazing at him intently the while : -are you afraid ?
0	there was every sort of thing in that fireplace , a brazier , a pot , broken boards , rags suspended from nails , a bird-cage , ashes , and even a little fire
0	he passed , pacific and severe , in the midst of naked swords
0	he is going away !
0	i have only a little lead sword , no longer than that
0	and in these two places , so similar yet so unlike , these two species of beings who were so very unlike , were undergoing the same work , expiation
0	when he awoke , he saw courfeyrac , enjolras , feuilly , and combeferre standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to go out
0	he ate the roll and opened the pocketbook
0	at night , one could distinguish nothing of all that mass of buildings , except the black indentation of the roofs , unrolling their chain of acute angles round the place ; for one of the radical differences between the cities of that time , and the cities of the present day , lay in the façades which looked upon the places and streets , and which were then gables
0	the door of the garret had just opened abruptly , and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses , and masked with masks of black paper
0	while reading himself this moral lesson , for there were occasions on which marius , like all truly honest hearts , was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved , he stared at the wall which separated him from the jondrettes , as though he were able to make his gaze , full of pity , penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people
0	this stick had been carefully trimmed , and had an air that was not too threatening ; the most had been made of its knots , and it had received a coral-like head , made from red wax : it was a cudgel , and it seemed to be a cane
0	had he done so , he would have seen the host of the cross of colbas standing on his threshold , surrounded by all the guests of his inn , and all the passers-by in the street , talking vivaciously , and pointing him out with his finger ; and , from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group , he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
0	there is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow
0	that , answered gavroche gravely , is for the rats
0	i could enter perfectly well by the back door , but that might create surprise perhaps , and it would be better , i think , for me to enter by the usual door
0	he is a sponge , to soak money raised from the people
0	all at once the recluse exclaimed , as though the gypsy ’ s question had taken all this time to reach her brain , -- what have you done to me ?
0	it was a charming animal , gentle , intelligent , clever ; a learned goat
0	but , as soon as the mass is finished , sarpejou !
0	to love a woman !
0	should he treat it as belonging to him ?
0	the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality , which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space
0	the audience was in suspense ; and all breasts heaved as though they had contained but one soul
0	she resumed ; i did not know what had become of it
0	the nightingale is a gratuitous elleviousummer , i salute thee !
0	i am a little fatigued , permit me to take a chair
0	from the proper employment of forces results public power
0	the four young women looked at each other
0	they succeeded in finding the carriage which had brought marius to the rue des filles-du-calvaire on the evening of the numberth of june
0	then they made him seat himself on a motley litter
0	come , that is true ; i even have a good appetite
0	the mighty city had cracked , in succession , its four enclosures of walls , like a child grown too large for his garments of last year
0	it seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar , and as though the wind were pouring through it
0	the counter-police of the chateau had denounced to her royal highness madame , the portrait , everywhere exhibited , of m the duc d'orleans , who made a better appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than m the duc de berri , in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons -- a serious inconvenience
0	the cardinal de cl t had been brought to madame de t s by his most intimate friend , m de roquelaure , former bishop of senlis , and one of the forty
0	rage found ladders , multiplied the torches , and , at the expiration of a few minutes , quasimodo , in despair , beheld that terrible ant heap mount on all sides to the assault of notre-dame
0	ecclesiastes says : all is vanity
0	not that this was fickleness of soul ; but hopes cut in twain by dejection -- that was her case
0	mamma , resumed the elder , is a lady who lives with mamselle miss
0	what 's that he 's got in his paddle ?
0	this trellis-work took the place of curtains
0	this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts
0	captain phoebus ’ s heart , like the physics of that day , abhorred a vacuum
0	some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother
0	that is not a firebrand of rebellion
0	do you think that leg of mutton good ?
0	in the angle at the left of this epaulement , there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in the rue saint-denis
0	if i could only once , just once more , a single time , put this shoe on her pretty little pink foot , i would die blessing you , good virgin
0	he had for a moment beheld very close at hand , in that obscurity , the young girl whom he loved , the old man who seemed to be her father , those unknown beings , who were his only interest and his only hope in this world ; and , at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them , a gust had swept all these shadows away
0	he was kindly , abrupt , charitable , and if he had been rich , his turn of mind would have been magnificent
0	take advantage of this opportunity
0	the ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries , is to resemble m royer-collard
0	the deposit honestly restored , the probity of the confession -- these were good
0	we should not have to enact a lie
0	this lasted for several months
0	he was cold ; he lighted a small fire ; it did not occur to him to close the window
0	the brave deaf man , assailed on all sides , had lost , if not all courage , at least all hope of saving , not himself ( he was not thinking of himself ) , but the gypsy
0	what was to be done ?
0	one can easily picture to one 's self these two women , both of whom were over sixty years of age
0	said the old man
0	the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall , in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him
0	i followed him ; you know the rest
0	not to consider here anything except the christian architecture of europe , that younger sister of the great masonries of the orient , it appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three well-defined zones , which are superposed , the one upon the other : the romanesque zone , the gothic zone , the zone of the renaissance , which we would gladly call the greco-roman zone
0	is that what you want ?
0	those of the prisoners who woke , pretended to fall asleep again , and left guelemer and brujon to their own devices
0	i have my papers , he said calmly
0	from the refectory the names had passed to the boarding-school , and there served as in the old college mazarin to distinguish four nations
0	what sections were there ?
0	thou art the largest , and pasquier is the smallest , and pasquier does best
0	m delalot was a personagelegitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand , then the head , of pleignier , of carbonneau , and of tolleronthe prince de talleyrand , grand chamberlain , and the abbe louis , appointed minister of finance , laughed as they looked at each other , with the laugh of the two augurs ; both of them had celebrated , on the numberth of july , number , the mass of federation in the champ de mars ; talleyrand had said it as bishop , louis had served it in the capacity of deacon
0	i do not wish thee to have any real griefs
0	at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room , and said : -monsieur owes twenty-six sous
0	she would make me eat her strawberries
0	it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed !
0	granting and conforming to the charter
0	now , one can not read nonsense with impunity
0	these combinations having been effected , feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley genrot on the right , his agent on the left , and himself , javert , in the rear , he took a pinch of snuff
0	the young girl wept , for she wished greatly to embrace her sister
0	when he came down again the portress interrogated him : well , doctor ?
0	he tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces , who was presented to him
0	to relax one 's grip , -- what a terrible thing !
0	it was the first enjoyment of self-love that he had ever experienced
0	although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges , he left his throne exposed to the light
0	in the chapel there was a gallery called l'oeil de boeuf
0	the street was deserted
0	night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at no
0	it was one of those blind alleys , which the special jargon terms branches
0	nothing at all , replied gisquette
0	when the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying , your son is squalling , thenardier would say ; do go and see what he wants
0	the populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular , because they knew that the flemish ambassadors , who had arrived two days previously , intended to be present at the representation of the mystery , and at the election of the pope of the fools , which was also to take place in the grand hall
0	this man and his dogs made two visits during the night
0	he was walking like a man who is running away
0	then he cut the boat ’ s moorings , pushed it from the shore with a long boat-hook , and , seizing two oars , seated himself in the bow , rowing with all his might towards midstream
0	it melts in love , which is its sun
0	have you the password ?
0	ordinarily it ends in that ocean : revolution
0	on reflecting upon this , he fell into perplexity
0	she dipped her pen in the ink , and turning to marius : -do you want to see ?
0	during the king ’ s absence , several despatches had been placed on his table , and he broke the seals himself
0	how much is it ?
0	it chanced that marius ' solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground , near the water
0	what we are doing here
0	it yields before the iron
0	to monsieurand madame pabourgeot , my most respectful complements , genflot , man of letters
0	a folio dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily a centime 's worth of chestnuts
0	what he beheld with anguish , a mother would have gazed upon with joy
0	the abbot of citeaux , the general of the order , was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy
0	i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists , and who gives me tickets sometimes
0	what had those men done ?
0	these sanctuaries , in the midst of the deluge of penal and barbarous jurisdictions which inundated the city , were a species of islands which rose above the level of human justice
0	on the chairs in disarray , among those fading flowers , beneath those extinct lights , people have thought of joy
0	toussaint was struck dumb , and could only answer him : -what is it , sir ?
0	we live in the midst of a gloomy society
0	the urchin 's profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and good sense
0	the bishop remained silent for a moment ; then he raised his grave eyes , and said gently to madame magloire : -and , in the first place , was that silver ours ?
0	one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole , like the rhone ; then , as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper , he smote the table with his fist , and shouted : -and with his goody-goody air !
0	no one could have told what was passing within him , not even himself
0	that done , he grasped le cabuc by the hair , as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked , and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear
0	oysters , cheese , and ham , said laigle
0	a diligence from the rue du bouloi took the trip to rouen by night at that date , and passed through vernon
0	marius alone , stationed on one side , at the extreme left of the barricade , saw them pass
0	one finds them in all ages , ever the same ; that is to say , always according to all times
0	it was no small matter to reach that glade
0	he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door , when the door opened again , and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening
0	the fury which had contracted it was followed by a strange smile full of ineffable sweetness , gentleness , and tenderness
0	gringoire broke out into a cold perspiration
0	the gayety of geronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of werther
0	the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word , the lark , and had replied in the most natural manner in the world : i do not know what you mean
0	m madeleine , who had taken up the docket again several moments before this , resumed with an air of perfect indifference : -and what reply did you receive ?
0	in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters , and its real name is rue des pots
0	he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight , and in the other case for its pitiless foresight ; and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess , a default of work and an excess of punishment
0	here is her shoe , all that is left me of her
0	and you also , you pardon me !
0	gringoire began to eat eagerly
0	we have more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius ' individuality
0	he took her by the hand , and they both went out
0	napoleon , as we have already explained , was in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand , like a pistol , aiming it now at one point , now at another , of the battle ; and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop freely
0	on the right , somerset had dornberg with the german light-horse , and on his left , trip with the belgian carabineers ; the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front , before and in the rear , by infantry and cavalry , had to face all sides
0	yes , she replied , with the bewildered air which unhappiness had given her
0	i have made up my mind not to hear that again -- i have just saved you -- let me finish first
0	in this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood , they laughed
0	promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am dead -- i shall feel it
0	there was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman
0	he was still in the same posture , with his breast bent over the table , his head lying flat on his arms , surrounded by glasses , beer-jugs and bottles
0	he meditated of nothing else ; he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat , and that his new coat was growing old , that his shirts were wearing out , that his hat was wearing out , that his boots were giving out , and he said to himself : if i could but see her once again before i die !
0	he still held the same opinions
0	my heart is full
0	he is the son of one of those brigands of the loire , but children are innocent of their fathers ' crimes
0	that gallows is for me !
0	but this lasted only for a moment
0	he only thought of m gillenormand in an amiable light , but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father
0	the two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager
0	he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover , and succeeded , by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented , in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival , and that the man was deceiving her
0	exclaimed the captain , that ’ s not the way to depart
0	cambronne 's reply produces the effect of a violent break
0	he went on , and where will the advocate of the crown be tried ?
0	you split our head !
0	the first room , opening on the street , served him as dining-room , the second was his bedroom , and the third his oratory
0	oh , come now , cried the student , gazing in turn at his brother and the alembics on the furnace , everything is preposterous here , both ideas and bottles !
0	it was an overturned wagon ; his foot recognized pools of water , gullies , and paving-stones scattered and piled up
0	once , having confidence in a fine september sun , marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at sceaux by courfeyrac , bossuet , and grantaire , hoping , what a dream !
0	cosette , my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little
0	let us make another trial , resumed the vagabond
0	is it a werewolf child ?
0	these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles
0	in the meantime , clopin trouillefou appeared to hold a momentary conference with the duke of egypt , and the emperor of galilee , who was completely drunk
0	certain success would attend the experiment of employing the city to manure the plain
0	then from the captain , his thought passed to the people , and there came to him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort
0	she became beautiful once more , in consequence of it
0	yes , for any one but jean valjean
0	the first comer is a wretch , femme -- woman -- rhymes with infame , -- infamous
0	life was no longer there , it was something else
0	and he added , deep in his own mind , i owe him a visit
0	go to the devil !
0	m mabeuf opened his bookcase , took a long look at all his books , one after another , as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice , then seized one hastily , put it in under his arm and went out
0	an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room
0	it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people , whose reasoning is hollow
0	i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend , a fruit-seller whom i know in the rue chemin-vert , who is deaf , and who has a little bed
0	write , clerk , said charmolue
0	the student watched his brother with surprise
0	the first , conscious that he was the more feeble , avoided the second ; but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious ; any one who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight , and all the menace that fear contains
0	i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette
0	these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the child 's mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart , and when they were all there , seated in a circle around a dying fire , sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green , with their severe profiles , their gray or white hair , their long gowns of another age , whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished , dropping , at rare intervals , words which were both majestic and severe , little marius stared at them with frightened eyes , in the conviction that he beheld not women , but patriarchs and magi , not real beings , but phantoms
0	it certainly was fantine 's signature ; thenardier recognized it
0	we shall be this evening in the rue de l'homme arme , no
0	that dazed me a bit
0	the old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter ; and henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics
0	in the winter i warmed myself in the sun , under the porch of the hôtel de sens , and i thought it very ridiculous that the fire on saint john ’ s day was reserved for the dog days
0	in the first place , i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is , that you have not uttered the faintest cry
0	these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individual anxieties
0	in what manner had enjolras subjugated him ?
0	a moment later he heard ma'am bougon take her departure , locking the door of the house behind her
0	it 's not the dying so much ; you die , for one must die , and that 's all right ; it 's the abomination of feeling those people touch you
0	nevertheless , he began to grow impatient with coppenole ’ s behavior , and suddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth , that the flemish giant recoiled , like a bull-dog before a cat
0	it is bonaparte 's fatal number
0	like dogs ; ah , this is abominable !
0	no violent remedy is necessary
0	the baker demands a settlement , and says , no money , no bread
0	quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat ; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell , breathed in this overwhelming breath , gazed by turns at the deep place , which swarmed with people , two hundred feet below him , and at that enormous , brazen tongue which came , second after second , to howl in his ear
0	nature had made her a lamb , religion had made her an angel
0	when doth it please you that i shall apprehend the little sorceress ?
0	you may , it seems to me , suppose that i have something which resembles a heart
0	as he proceeded , bruneseau drew , directed , and completed considerable works ; in number he lowered the arch of the ponceau , and , everywhere creating new lines , he pushed the sewer , in number , under the rue saint-denis as far as the fountain of the innocents ; in number , under the rue froidmanteau and under the salpetriere ; in number under the rue neuve-des-petits-peres , under the rue du mail , under the rue de l'echarpe , under the place royale ; in number , under the rue de la paix , and under the chaussee d'antin
0	it appears that gringoire had taken advantage of the moment of debarcation to slip away with the goat into the block of houses of the rue grenier-sur-l ’ eau
0	his face was the same color as his trousers
0	it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes
0	he conformed to the bourgeois 's directions , and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people , and where groups , intermingled with lawyers in their gowns , were whispering together here and there
0	one day , the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence : to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned ?
0	they lived nameless , designated only by numbers , and converted , after a manner , into ciphers themselves , with downcast eyes , with lowered voices , with shorn heads , beneath the cudgel and in disgrace
0	reduced to itself , abandoned by the other arts , because human thought is abandoning it , it summons bunglers in place of artists
0	human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance , a third lower floor
0	there are thoughts which play us the same trick ; they nestle away in a corner of our brain ; that is the end of them ; they are lost ; it is impossible to lay the memory on them
0	their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite
0	fex urbis , exclaims cicero ; mob , adds burke , indignantly ; rabble , multitude , populace
0	you shall see how i love you also
0	brother what father of the church is it , who says that the errors of heretics have always had for their lurking place the thickets of aristotle ’ s metaphysics ?
0	nothing easier , replied the host
0	as for us , all our glorification goes to the english soldier , to the english army , to the english people
0	i believe in you
0	the bailiff de ferrette , with his short breeches and his thin legs , sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de talleyrand
0	brennus answers : the wrong that alba did to you , the wrong that fidenae did to you , the wrong that the eques , the volsci , and the sabines have done to you
0	jehan , you have no soul
0	hence his possession was in good faith
0	more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said : where the devil are my two children ?
0	their prayer audaciously offers discussion
0	several hours before the barricade was attacked , he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon , with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice
0	he had finally grown bold , and approached the bench
0	the one who is on the point of departure is a saint
0	it is necessary , for the sake of the forward march of the human race , that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights
0	do you know who little father lenoir is ?
0	souls which blossomed out yesterday , and are faded to-day , like those flowers let fall in the streets , which are soiled with every sort of mire , while waiting for some wheel to crush them
0	he goes to the spectacles which god furnishes gratis ; he gazes at the sky , space , the stars , flowers , children , the humanity among which he is suffering , the creation amid which he beams
0	it was a dead body which remained hanging there , bent double , its loins broken , its skull empty
0	there was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church
0	you hear the bell
0	her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from god , -- laughter
0	she alone could accuse her lover , and destroy him by her confession
0	we live in times of terrible confusion
0	the cure of this big church ?
0	she is the first awake , the last asleep
0	it makes use of death , a serious matter
0	a tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room , deposited his thirty sous and selected , according to the part which he wished to play , the costume which suited him , and on descending the stairs once more , the knave was a somebody
0	that very evening , the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure , and some time afterwards m myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of d -- -what truth was there , after all , in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m myriel 's life ?
0	her glance fell upon the water which stood before her ; such was the fright which the thenardier inspired in her , that she dared not flee without that bucket of water : she seized the handle with both hands ; she could hardly lift the pail
0	marius disengaged his head from his grandfather 's arms , and said gently : but , father , now that i am quite well , it seems to me that i might see her
0	learn this in addition ; the wineshops of the ragpickers are called bibines ; the most celebrated are the saucepan and the slaughter-house
0	the district-attorney 's persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one , of the public , of the court , and of the jury
0	this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him , and , taking it all in all , he accepted it ; but he was none the less bewildered
0	some of the scoffed-at did , nevertheless , penetrate thither on sufferance
0	these be-ribboned and be-flowered tumbrils of mire are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public
0	but he was too late
0	they gave the petticoat to eponine
0	i heard the eight singers of the king of sicily intone the first verse of seven o ’ clock mass in the sainte-chapelle
0	they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal
0	the enigma was more impenetrable than ever
0	it had rained the night before , and even a little in the morning
0	the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched
0	it sometimes happened that kind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him
0	in others , any one entered who wished , and the room was so full that they were forced to stand
0	besides , what is danger in comparison with the right ?
0	marius gazed intently at him : i know your extraordinary secret , just as i knew jean valjean 's name , just as i know your name
0	he no longer knew where he was , what he thought , or whether he were dreaming
0	at length the archdeacon , giving quasimodo ’ s powerful shoulder a rough shake , made him a sign to rise and follow him
0	the barricade had been put in order , the tap-room disencumbered , the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance , the dressing of the wounded completed , the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up , bullets run , cartridges manufactured , lint scraped , the fallen weapons re-distributed , the interior of the redoubt cleaned , the rubbish swept up , corpses removed
0	there were corpses lying prone there , and phantoms standing erect
0	marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle
0	besides brevet , there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean ; they are cochepaille and chenildieu , and are sentenced for life
0	as soon as cujas had taken his departure , gamacho entered
0	they are all alike !
0	jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering ; he emerged impassive
0	what was i thinking of to thrust myself into that stone gimlet which pierces the sky ; all for the sake of eating bearded cheese , and looking at the bell-towers of paris through a hole in the wall !
0	they attached themselves , without intermediate shades , to incorruptible right and absolute duty
0	this would enjoin us from consigning something sublime to history
0	a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade
0	this last member of his phrase remained unuttered
0	this was the moment when eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard
0	you , your shade , the image of the luminous apparition which had one day crossed the space before me
0	he was a man of whom his superiors said , he tries to make himself of use
0	gringoire fell backwards , quite thunderstruck with joy
0	how do i know ? -- a mere nothing , a horse , a remark !
0	whether monsieur your father comes in that category , i do not know !
0	enjolras did not appear to be listening , but had any one been near him , that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice : patria
0	was he , in short , the man whom thenardier thought that he recognized ?
0	the bride 's garter is cousin to the girdle of venus
0	the besieged man , alas !
0	he shouted : long live the republic !
0	in closing , it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of quasimodo
0	i am going to suppress the candelabra
0	i hastened to thee , thou wert no longer there
0	gringoire was on the point of taking the bag in his hand
0	simplice of sicily , as we know , is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse -- a lie which would have saved her
0	from that moment forth , all was over ; the ogre of corsica , -- the usurper , -- the tyrant , -- the monster who was the lover of his own sisters , -- the actor who took lessons of talma , -- the poisoner of jaffa , -- the tiger , -- buonaparte , -- all this vanished , and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone , at an inaccessible height , the pale marble phantom of caesar
0	so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs , monsieur pontmercy
0	what say you , messieurs les bourgeois ?
0	these squares were no longer battalions , they were craters ; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry , they were a tempest
0	replied the fat magistrate , half aroused , it ’ s tolerably jolly , that ’ s a fact
0	what will become of her , poor creature ?
0	only , he felt that he could not do otherwise , now that he used thou to cosette , than say you to eponine
0	thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall , in order to preserve it from the rats , as he said
0	let us inflict punishment , since we are history : old blucher disgraced himself
0	jean valjean tore up his shirt , bandaged the young man 's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood ; then bending over marius , who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing , in that half light , he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred
0	philosophy should be an energy ; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man
0	it was falling into ruins ; every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it
0	hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house
0	favourite was the first to break the silence
0	nevertheless , the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the modern palace , bristling with carved eaves , covered with sheets of lead , where coiled a thousand fantastic arabesques of sparkling incrustations of gilded bronze , that roof , so curiously damascened , darted upwards gracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice ; whose huge and ancient towers , rounded by age like casks , sinking together with old age , and rending themselves from top to bottom , resembled great bellies unbuttoned
0	i must inform you that i have just seen the king , louis xi , and that i have caught this oath from him , -- _pasque-dieu_ !
0	are you set on the death of that spy ?
0	terrible , toad-like tongue which goes and comes , leaps , crawls , slobbers , and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night , of hunger , of vice , of falsehood , of injustice , of nudity , of suffocation , and of winter , the high noonday of the miserable
0	villager , retorted the man , i ought not be a grave-digger
0	then he turned to cosette
0	this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods
0	one would have said that they were two criminals
0	marius ' emotion was profound
0	the waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him
0	if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life , it is probable that we should behold the forms of night , the winged unknowns , the blue passers of the invisible , bend down , a throng of sombre heads , around the luminous house , satisfied , showering benedictions , pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed , sweetly terrified , and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances
0	the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
0	in the meanwhile , she wept in torrents , in silence , in the dark , like a rain at night
0	human actions are taken by two handles
0	have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand , if you can
0	they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order
0	a redoubtable method , and one which , united with genius , rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years
0	virtue , granted , but madness also
0	he exclaimed : it is immoral that a mattress should have so much power
0	well , said she , it 's the lark !
0	he had been a terrible man
0	but let us leave the soldier , especially the contemporary soldier , out of the question
0	he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette
0	no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play ; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting , the president that he was there to preside , the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend
0	so saying , he handed the stranger the three bank-bills
0	he is resisting , fluttering his tiny wings , and still making an effort to fly , but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air
0	but i still owe the thenardiers over a hundred francs ; do you know that , monsieur inspector ?
0	she ventured to ask : -is it true , madame ?
0	dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march
0	tumultuous and stagnant gulf
0	madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest : -we say that this house is not safe at all ; that if monseigneur will permit , i will go and tell paulin musebois , the locksmith , to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors ; we have them , and it is only the work of a moment ; for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer-by ; and i say that we need bolts , monseigneur , if only for this night ; moreover , monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in ' ; and besides , even in the middle of the night , o mon dieu !
0	he felt that icy breath close to him , on his heels
0	in the brotherhood of gamins voltaire is not known , but papavoine is
0	what was she doing ?
0	these men did not astonish each other
0	he reflected that had he not given his five francs to the jondrette girl in the morning , he would have followed m leblanc 's fiacre , and consequently have remained ignorant of everything , and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the jondrettes and that m leblanc would have been lost , and his daughter with him , no doubt
0	but his whole nature revolted ; his aged paternity would not consent to this
0	no one would have dared to mention them ; no one would have dared to recall them
0	and , with an imperious motion , the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed , and brought him to his knees in the mire
0	they had wit ; they had silence ; their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance ; they should have succeeded
0	what did he think of this dogma , or of that mystery ?
0	he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her , he owed her his happiness , and yet , it was embarrassing to him to meet her
0	eponine and azelma had passed hours in contemplating it , and cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it , on the sly , it is true
0	hartwell 's pine table took its place in front of the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of louis xiv
0	it is a pity
0	a man for nothing !
0	jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction
0	nevertheless , it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them
0	the profile had a rose in its mouth
0	at the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride , he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots , and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness
0	properly speaking , he did not enter
0	he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago , when i was adjutant-guard of convicts at toulon
0	that face had clung to his mind
0	it will be a lesson to the bonapartists !
0	in populous cities , especially in capitals , there existed no single , central , regulating power
0	he has just committed a fresh theft ; it is a case of a second offence ; condemn him for the fresh deed ; later on he will be judged for the old crime
0	do you know , young girl , what i saw thenceforth between my book and me ?
0	captain , pursued the man , to-morrow , the day after to-morrow , a month hence , ten years hence , you will find me ready to cut your throat ; but go first to your rendezvous
0	the barber in his shop , which was warmed by a good stove , was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy , that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets , but whose mind was evidently unsheathed
0	the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time
0	in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion ; and it irritated him to have that within him
0	cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor , on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse ; and sometimes , when the day had been a good one , and they had assisted many in distress , and cheered and warmed many little children , cosette was rather merry in the evening
0	but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish , which one need but skirt ?
0	consider that i pray you on my knees , as one prays to jesus christ !
0	a full hour passed in the most profound silence
0	it 's true that i became bankrupt , that i am in hiding , that i have no bread , that i have not a single sou , that i am a villain !
0	moreover , he was a sad , grave , serious child , who studied ardently , and learned quickly ; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour , mixed but little in the bacchanals of the rue du fouarre , did not know what it was to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_ , and had cut no figure in that revolt of number , which the annalists register gravely , under the title of the sixth trouble of the university
0	jean prouvaire was in love ; he cultivated a pot of flowers , played on the flute , made verses , loved the people , pitied woman , wept over the child , confounded god and the future in the same confidence , and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head , that of andre chenier
0	the one who is in the shadows
0	such was the paris which the ravens , who lived in number , beheld from the summits of the towers of notre-dame
0	_nudus vinctus , centum pondo , es quando pendes per pedes_
0	the man , who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself , observed the child with peculiar attention
0	you will not take her from me , i am sure
0	the austere and glacial envelope of claude frollo , that cold surface of steep and inaccessible virtue , had always deceived jehan
0	what did cosette 's soul contain ?
0	oh , this is hell !
0	for the space of nearly two years we have made you happywe bear you no grudge for that
0	if one opened it , one found one 's self in a little chamber about six feet square , tiled , well-scrubbed , clean , cold , and hung with nankin paper with green flowers , at fifteen sous the roll
0	[ number ] [ number ] un fafiot serieux
0	henceforth , it is apt at all roles , it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter , covered with verdigris by the forger , blacked by the soot of the incendiary ; and the murderer applies its rouge
0	the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to complain of their lot
0	there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life
0	with his right hand , the deaf man detached one by one , in silence , with sinister slowness , all the pieces of his armor , the sword , the daggers , the helmet , the cuirass , the leg pieces
0	and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck , he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl , where the scarf became a shawl once more
0	he had made up his mind about the tumult , and was determined to proceed to the end , not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public
0	said he , now we are safe , all four of us
0	it was a dog scanning a thief
0	he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
0	the furnace was being heated
0	why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit-picpus ?
0	meanwhile , jehan was shouting in a hoarse voice :
0	she must be a big girl now ; she is seven years old ; she is quite a young lady ; i call her cosette , but her name is really euphrasie
0	the symbol is not the number
0	cosette was intoxicated , delighted , frightened , in heaven
0	i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop
0	the man bowed lower at that harsh voice
0	it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand , all cracked with chilblains , and kissed it
0	it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him , and he wished , before entering joyously into the future , to obtain a quittance from the past
0	you shall see what fun we will have
0	methusalem is a street arab beside cupid
0	you follow me , do you not ?
0	these young men formed a sort of family , through the bond of friendship
0	and turning to madame hucheloup , he added : -woman ancient and consecrated by use , draw near that i may contemplate thee !
0	we have so many expenses
0	by dint of toil , perseverance , courage , and will , he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year
0	no , said the gypsy
0	murmured marius , how beautiful you are !
0	my dear , continued fleur-de-lys , with decided sharpness , you will get yourself taken up by the sumptuary police for your gilded girdle
0	the charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled
0	farewell to mystery , myth , law
0	the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of number was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness , and which contains a little shame ; it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams ; it was the halt
0	the spiral staircase , hewn asunder with the axe , lay in the middle of the tap-room , a few wounded men were just breathing their last , every one who was not killed was on the first floor , and from there , through the hole in the ceiling , which had formed the entrance of the stairs , a terrific fire burst forth
0	in one of these moments he suddenly beheld the long window on the balcony , whose stone balustrade projected above his head , open mysteriously
0	perhaps it was tuesday
0	the gypsy was not insensible to these pin-pricks
0	what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards thenardier , was the idea of the distress into which he knew that thenardier had fallen , and which had engulfed the latter
0	he resumed : he lives in the marais , rue des filles-du-calvaire , with his grandfather
0	see here , you are no more a baron than my slipper is !
0	as she performed this service , she was conversing with mademoiselle baptistine
0	then paquette la chantefleurie burst into hyena-like laughter
0	you would have to buy it to begin with , because no one knows you
0	now , at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal , the nine parts of self-esteem in gringoire , swollen and expanded by the breath of popular admiration , were in a state of prodigious augmentation , beneath which disappeared , as though stifled , that imperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets ; a precious ingredient , by the way , a ballast of reality and humanity , without which they would not touch the earth
0	they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns , and with kicks , shouting , calling , entreating , wringing their hands
0	fantine did not seem to hear it
0	we have just seen the head of the procession pass , joly and i
0	she cried , with an appalling laugh ; tis the egyptian who is calling me !
0	i think i actually did meet monsieur personally , several years ago , at the house of madame la princesse bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his lordship the vicomte dambray , peer of france
0	jean had no work
0	what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor
0	the doctor examined marius , and after having found that his pulse was still beating , that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast , and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils , he had him placed flat on the bed , without a pillow , with his head on the same level as his body , and even a trifle lower , and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration
0	and then a struggle arose as to who should remain , and who should find reasons for the others not remaining
0	at the moment when the cart moved off , he admitted that he had felt , a moment previously , a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding
0	moreover , he had in the audience , a pitiless censor of his deeds and gestures , in the person of our friend jehan frollo du moulin , that little student of yesterday , that stroller , whom one was sure of encountering all over paris , anywhere except before the rostrums of the professors
0	so the monk 's widow was good for something
0	it was now the mother 's turn to start up and exclaim : -just see there !
0	the roll was called
0	on that same night , then , when little gavroche picked up the two lost children , brujon and guelemer , who knew that babet , who had escaped that morning , was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse , rose softly , and with the nail which brujon had found , began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood
0	what do i owe you , madame , he added
0	my friends , there is a morrow ; you will not be here to-morrow , but your families will ; and what sufferings !
0	the landlady 's red and violent face brightened up hideously
0	was it you who killed the artillery sergeant ?
0	the woman remained motionless
0	to see her once again ; he still aspired to this , but he no longer expected it
0	a glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler 's wagon with a fluted wicker hood , harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted , hidden , as it were , behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to nivelles , at the angle of the road from mont-saint-jean to braine l'alleud ; and in the wagon , a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages
0	like it , it is the divine spark ; like it , it is incorruptible , indivisible , imperishable
0	it was there , that , about number , was committed that mysterious assassination , called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier , whose authors justice was never able to discover ; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated , a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled
0	he felt , even in the very roots of his hair , the immense reawakening of egotism , and the _i_ in this man 's abyss howled
0	any one who was hungry could present himself there , and was sure of finding employment and bread
0	tis an abortion of a monkey , remarked gauchère
0	if a flood comes , the mountains will have long disappeared beneath the waves , while the birds will still be flying about ; and if a single ark floats on the surface of the cataclysm , they will alight upon it , will float with it , will be present with it at the ebbing of the waters ; and the new world which emerges from this chaos will behold , on its awakening , the thought of the world which has been submerged soaring above it , winged and living
0	he shut his eyes , and when he opened them again , he thought they were a circle of pale visages gazing at him
0	at the same time the strange army executed several evolutions , as though it were taking up its post around the church
0	he realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk
0	a man has a hemlet on his head , a sword in his hand , and golden spurs on his heels
0	at that moment the crowd broke into applause : old convict-sergeants among them wept , and women embraced each other on the quay , and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage , pardon for that man !
0	but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss
0	what is the matter ?
0	he was transparent but impenetrable
0	meanwhile , the archdeacon was panting
0	the man ceased speaking , and remained standing
0	room for a brief parenthesis
0	hardly the sound of a breath was audible
0	did i exist before my birth ?
0	you shall see , gentlemen , that i , in my turn , can say : it is impossible
0	claude , in the state of hallucination in which he found himself , believed that he saw , that he saw with his actual eyes , the bell tower of hell ; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the terrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior furnace ; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many shrieks , so many death groans
0	gringoire scratched his ear , with a very serious air
0	we are going to bring him back , to take him with us , whether he is willing or not , he shall never leave us again
0	but you , mahiette -- why do you run so at the mere sight of them ?
0	and again she offered him her brow
0	she seized on these words with avidity
0	there were now four men , three seated on the bed , one standing near the door-post , all four with bare arms and motionless , with faces smeared with black
0	in what manner , in consequence of what prodigy , had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal ?
0	i was very desperate indeed there , that i was
0	although this was the most strictly walled of all convents , we shall endeavor to make our way into it , and to take the reader in , and to say , without transgressing the proper bounds , things which story-tellers have never seen , and have , therefore , never described
0	there are many such virtuous people in this lower world ; some day they will be in the world above
0	here , i have burned my coat
0	each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from gringoire ’ s loins , and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook , began to be established in rough fashion
0	for a moment he thought himself lost
0	he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom , painted by jordaens , executed with great dashes of the brush , with millions of details , in a confused and hap-hazard manner
0	marius directed his steps towards that red light
0	courage was necessary ; she possessed it , and held herself firm
0	for his part , he thought the barricade ripe , and as that which is ripe ought to fall , he made the attempt
0	javert interrupted him : -you will say that i might have handed in my resignation , but that does not suffice
0	a very white and very pure light brought out vividly to the eye all the outlines that its thousands of houses present to the east
0	disorder humbles itself and becomes silly
0	both started , and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes
0	come , have a little pity , gringoire ; be generous in your turn ; it was she who set the example
0	the piece was only to begin with the twelfth stroke of the great palace clock sounding midday
0	you will see how well the whole thing will work
0	nevertheless , whatever may be the voltairianism of the small gamin , if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself , it is quite possible that he will accept , and in that case he serves the mass civilly
0	a moment later , the window-shutter was closed , and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
0	when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour , he sang the praises of marius ; he pronounced him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good
0	i weep for all , said the bishop
0	and with health , there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his grandfather
0	are you sure , persisted claude , with his penetrating glance , that it is only a word and not a name ?
0	it weighs upon the woman , that is to say , upon grace , weakness , beauty , maternity
0	sir , resumed the road-mender ; shall i give you a piece of advice ?
0	but , first of all , i will make you read , one after the other , the marble letters of the alphabet , the granite pages of the book
0	in the eyes of despotic governments , who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself , the revolution of july committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle
0	was it you , my good monsieur javert , who said that i was to be set free ?
0	when the poor bellringer became deaf , there had been established between him and claude frollo , a language of signs , mysterious and understood by themselves alone
0	because the country is dangerous ; it is full of cannibals
0	she did not know what a gold piece was ; she had never seen one ; she hid it quickly in her pocket , as though she had stolen it
0	he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him ; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not , in truth , unjust , but that it most assuredly was iniquitous
0	marigny , the brother of the pompadour , had his entry with m le prince de soubise
0	it is a hard trade
0	will you stop your noise ?
0	marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set javert ; but javert had no sooner quitted the building , bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches , than marius also glided out of the house
0	i meet you here on the staircase , and then i often see you going to a person named father mabeuf who lives in the direction of austerlitz , sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter
0	he struck marius with his first conjecture
0	jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day ; he had merely had the glass door leading to cosette 's dressing-room replaced by a solid door
0	hence he remained upon his tower on the watch , dreaming in his dream-place , as rabelais says , with his eye directed alternately on the cell and on paris , keeping faithful guard , like a good dog , with a thousand suspicions in his mind
0	there were continual outbursts , melodies , unexpected cadences , then simple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes ; then floods of scales which would have put a nightingale to rout , but in which harmony was always present ; then soft modulations of octaves which rose and fell , like the bosom of the young singer
0	spain buys a great deal of it
0	he was the sole bond , the sole connection , the sole communication which remained to her with men , with the living
0	the spectacle which presented itself to his eyes , when his ragged escort finally deposited him at the end of his trip , was not fitted to bear him back to poetry , even to the poetry of hell
0	to behold thee going and coming from dawn in thy chemise , gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror !
0	the whole barricade gave vent to a cry ; but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy ; for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth ; gavroche had fallen only to rise again ; he remained in a sitting posture , a long thread of blood streaked his face , he raised both arms in the air , glanced in the direction whence the shot had come , and began to sing : je suis tombe par terre , i have fallen to the earth , c'est la faute a voltaire ; 't is the fault of voltaire ; le nez dans le ruisseau , with my nose in the gutter , c'est la faute a
0	he was a man of lofty stature , half peasant , half artisan
0	you hear the man who saw it
0	he said to himself ( for gringoire , like a true dramatic poet , was subject to monologues ) there they are obstructing my fire !
0	and she began to hum these words to a gay air : -- j'ai faim , mon pere
0	exclaimed jondrette , buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance , you are looking at your overcoat ?
0	here the question of war comes up
0	they never could have become rich otherwise !
0	she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking
0	are your parents alive ?
0	so saying , he placed his hand gayly on his shoulder
0	what concern is it of yours ?
0	at the same time our parents keep writing to uspressure on both sides
0	he made sure of his back burrows , as huntsmen say ; he hastily despatched one of his agents , by a roundabout way , to guard that issue
0	as long as there was any danger , m gillenormand , seated in despair at his grandson 's pillow , was , like marius , neither alive nor dead
0	it was an odd moment when cosette 's rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll
0	at first sight , this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution ; the father , when he hired the chamber , had stated that his name was jondrette
0	what is this dead-room ?
0	do you acknowledge your faults ?
0	it was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes
0	it is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power
0	you have promised me to become an honest man
0	this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me , and who is , no doubt , blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers ; those peoples are rascals ; and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures ; and i was going off to denounce myself ; and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly !
0	if you are not satisfied , dogs , burst !
0	the matter with me is that i am hungry , replied gavroche frankly
0	he arrived there , after a journey of twenty-seven days , on a cart , with a chain on his neck
0	yes , my child , replied the thenardier
0	cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent , and she regulated their expenditure , which was very modest
0	as an abbreviation , his companions called him bossuet
0	and he turned to jean valjean : take the spy
0	obviously , there was hatred between that police spy and the galley-slave
0	the archdeacon replied without perturbation : there are certain things of which i think in a certain fashion
0	that was the kind of foot which she had
0	what was the champmathieu affair in comparison with cosette 's marriage and of that which it entailed ?
0	as possessor of this fief , claude frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in paris and its suburbs ; and for a long time , his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality , between the hôtel de tancarville , belonging to master françois le rez , and the college of tours , in the records deposited at saint martin des champs
0	stupefied , he turned round
0	come , said gringoire to himself , with a sigh , the others are listening
0	thank you , sir , said the child
0	a clash of principles resembles a clash of elements
0	you have a charming cravat on this morning , marius
0	mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe !
0	her feet will tread this sand , this walk , two paces from me ?
0	on entering there , each one who was rich makes himself poor
0	an instant later , the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more , and he added : -i am making a mistake in the beast ; he 's not a whiting , he 's a serpent
0	as for its purpose , of which we just spoke , it fulfils it to a marvel ; it is a bourse in france as it would have been a temple in greece
0	gavroche was seento stagger , then he sank to the earth
0	if only he is at home !
0	the six hundred thousand francs really belong to cosette
0	they reckoned on it
0	let us mingle majesty with the feast
0	to arrest him too hastily would be to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs
0	the duke of egypt , seated on a stone post , contemplated the phantasmagorical bonfire , glowing at a height of two hundred feet in the air , with religious terror
0	this name of brujon is one of the souvenirs of la force
0	inspector javert , replied the mayor , in a calm and conciliating tone , listen
0	jondrette replied with dignity : -that is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning
0	poor people had taken him in out of charity , but they had bread only for themselves
0	and he wrote to demand twelve francs
0	let 's settle it in three words , and part at once
0	at another time , on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side , wherein not only the dignities of the dead man , but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives , spread over an entire page : what a stout back death has !
0	and you will say to me , ah !
0	theodule seated himself , and m gillenormand rose
0	her cap had fallen on her knees
0	in vain did the poor girl summon up her courage ; on entering this chamber she was stricken with horror
0	all beliefs are possible to him
0	thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse , drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean
0	she lifted the stone , which was tolerably large
0	each vied with the other in laying his claws upon him
0	the insurgents ' cartridges were giving out ; but not their sarcasms
0	it is all the same to me , she said
0	we have already seen something of his history
0	the deaf man gazed at her
0	a filousophe [ philosophe ] , a scientific thief
0	he held both these arms with one hand , and groped along the wall with the other
0	thenardier exclaimed : -are you mad !
0	i put it in my pocket
0	beyond , the opaqueness was massive ; to penetrate thither seemed horrible , an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment
0	what man is there who has not entered , at least once in his life , into that obscure cavern of the unknown ?
0	now , went on the king of thunes , twist your right foot round your left leg , and rise on the tip of your left foot
0	when a man is no longer young , they call him nothing but an old bird , old beast !
0	why do not you have a cat ?
0	monseigneur , said gringoire , so you absolutely insist on my breaking some one of my limbs ?
0	a big dog , seated on his tail , gazed at the fire
0	he had done this with so much unrelenting animosity that the inscription , _eduensis episcopus_ , had become almost effaced
0	the ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law , as above every other
0	i have been of the watch these fifteen years , and i hear her every evening cursing the bohemian women with endless imprecations
0	a sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among the besiegers
0	he 's in close confinement
0	what a pretty voice you have !
0	he had released fantine 's hand
0	there was an affair that promised well in the rue plumet , a deserted street , an isolated house , an old rotten gate on a garden , and lone women
0	for the hunchback was robust ; for the bandy-legged fellow was agile ; for the deaf man was malicious : three qualities which temper ridicule
0	it seemed to him that god was for him now , and was manifesting himself
0	courfeyrac , seated on a paving-stone beside enjolras , continued to insult the cannon , and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles which is called grape-shot passed overhead with its terrible sound he assailed it with a burst of irony
0	it has brought back tradition , worship , religion , respect
0	they seem dead , they are living
0	and in such weather !
0	nevertheless , continued the president , even in the man whom the law has degraded , there may remain , when the divine mercy permits it , a sentiment of honor and of equity
0	the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant
0	well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness
0	and he took off his shoes
0	not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow
0	he made one bound as far as the priest , looked at him , and fell upon his knees
0	gavroche became thoughtful also
0	she had a way of her own of saying things , which spiced her reminiscences of the village and of her springtime
0	repeated the captain ; and he beckoned her to approach
0	he would have slipped through our fingers !
0	she called him : my dear , my little friend , my good man , etc , with her mouth while her heart was silent
0	they succor the poor , they care for the sick
0	he would have turned pale , had it been possible for him to become any paler
0	she pouted , and replied , no
0	the solitude of this spot , where so many crimes have been committed , had something terrible about it
0	a little while ago , when they came to tell us to come to you , i still thought that i was about to die , but it was from joy
0	god had done a grander thing with it , he had lodged a child there
0	very good , master pierre ; but how comes it that you are now in company with that gypsy dancer ?
0	his mind could get along without belief , but his heart could not get along without friendship
0	he saw him enter the rue du chemin-vert-saint-antoine ; he remembered the cul-de-sac genrot arranged there like a trap , and of the sole exit of the rue droit-mur into the rue petit-picpus
0	that makes no difference to me
0	i imagined that all that belonged to me
0	what am i saying ?
0	father fauchelevent rattled in the throat , and shrieked : -i am strangling !
0	the portress had done up his room ; only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackened by the fire
0	all at once she began to weep like a child
0	the ellipsis is the zig-zag of the phrase
0	it is a strange thing that this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors , that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody , and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the judgment day , and to-morrow into the reed-flute !
0	i prefer a breakfast to a hearse
0	a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her , as though to the duchess de berry !
0	there is no reason why a deaf man talking to a deaf man should stop
0	he retreated , growling between his teeth : -why , what 's the matter with her ?
0	he advanced a pace , closed the door mechanically behind him , and remained standing , contemplating what he saw
0	and he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes
0	was i then , lord , so miserable a creature , that you could not look at me before condemning me ? -- alas !
0	[ number ] [ number ] jeanne was born at fougere , a true shepherd 's nest ; i adore her petticoat , the rogue
0	he had not noticed him on his arrival
0	and that you are a rascal
0	which should he take ?
0	the guillotine is the concretion of the law ; it is called vindicte ; it is not neutral , and it does not permit you to remain neutral
0	he flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth
0	there are , in revolutions , swimmers who go against the current ; they are the old parties
0	the agents of police were armed with carabines , with bludgeons , swords and poignards
0	i never saw him so well dressed as on that day
0	the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book , and set to reading it with avidity , a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught , which caused them to close the volume precipitately
0	joly , perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter , extracted philosophy from it
0	marius ' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer boulevards , or in the champs-de-mars , or in the least frequented alleys of the luxembourg
0	this time , the fear was genuine ; the stone was there
0	he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family , returned from the emigration
0	it had neither windows nor air-holes , its only aperture was the door ; men could enter there , air could not
0	cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him
0	these same atoms dilated in accordance with a certain law need only be condensed in accordance with another law
0	one would say that he was a doge of venice on his way to his bridal with the sea
0	let us remark in passing , that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight
0	he once chanced to see a general on horseback , in full uniform , pass along the street , comte coutard , the commandant of paris
0	let such leave the ranks
0	the barriere du combat is not the coliseum , but people are as ferocious there as though caesar were looking on
0	so you have a lodging ?
0	who will go with me ?
0	this produced a singular effect upon him
0	for , at our epoch , we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility
0	the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the african generals dashed itself
0	to-day a little girl , to-morrow a woman
0	he set to work
0	the day is vulgar , said he , and deserves only a closed shutter
0	he was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that
0	something very similar to faust ’ s cell presented itself to jehan ’ s view , when he ventured his head through the half-open door
0	the day was declining
0	and the stained glass ?
0	and fifteen sous , added the man
0	the disappearance of wars , of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers , such is the inevitable progression
0	yes , this age is infamous , infamous and that 's what i think of you , of your ideas , of your systems , of your masters , of your oracles , of your doctors , of your scape-graces of writers , of your rascally philosophers , and of all the revolutions which , for the last sixty years , have been frightening the flocks of crows in the tuileries !
0	well , i request one
0	this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority
0	have not you an intimate friend ?
0	this happens just right , said courfeyrac , i have forgotten my purse , and i have lost my hat
0	it was but too surely la esmeralda
0	then still sobbing , he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times , as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights , and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done , whatever it was , he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children
0	it was three days since shehad seen marius
0	let the reader recall what that name meant to him !
0	each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the under side of civilization
0	jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie
0	above all , he was good ; and , a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur , in the matter of poetry , he preferred the immense
0	a man is not a monster because he was at waterloo ; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that
0	an hour later he had quitted saint-pol and was directing his course towards tinques , which is only five leagues from arras
0	children are so weak that the first comer , even a man like me , can become their protector
0	he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue saint-georges and the long , bifurcated corridor of the chaussee d'antin
0	in any case , it was evident that the garden had been violated , and that strangers had made their way into it
0	on the one hand , all shadow ; on the other , an atom
0	this duc de val , although prince de mon , that is to say a reigning prince abroad , had so high an idea of france and its peerage , that he viewed everything through their medium
0	it merely seemed to him , that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant
0	all this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty pity ; perceiving on his left , at a spot where there now stands a large tomb , those admirable scotch grays , with their superb horses , massing themselves , he said , it is a pity
0	the misery of a young man is never miserable
0	he was intelligent , and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus ; while he was , in reality , only a product of pigault-lebrun
0	they were icy cold
0	that which is icy is sincere
0	come , will you breakfast with us to-day ?
0	fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood ; she went from house to house
0	at that moment , one of the salamander ’ s braids of hair became unfastened , and a piece of yellow copper which was attached to it , rolled to the ground
0	the revolt had , for the past two days , deeply agitated , enraged and engrossed the mind of m gillenormand
0	_erat enim ut si mundus , ipse excutiendo semet , rejecta vetustate , candida ecclesiarum vestem indueret_
0	jean valjean was not dead
0	the meadow of the lark
0	they conferred as to the necessity of seizing the person of m le maire of m sur m this phrase , in which there was a great deal of of , is the district-attorney 's , written with his own hand , on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general
0	these pistols were still loaded
0	enjolras and courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment of the rue mondetour which opens through the rue des precheurs an issue into the halles , wishing , no doubt , to preserve a possible communication with the outside , and not entertaining much fear of an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the rue des precheurs
0	two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way
0	on the numberth of june , number , a company of the national guards from the suburbs , commanded by the captain fannicot , above mentioned , had itself decimated in the rue de la chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good pleasure
0	her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her ; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions , and obeyed blindly
0	his head was thrown back on the pillow , in the careless attitude of repose ; his hand , adorned with the pastoral ring , and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions , was hanging over the edge of the bed
0	this success emboldened marius
0	that is why he had a very simple funeral for fantine , and reduced it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper 's grave
0	thirty sous at least
0	m madeleine , on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest , got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the rue saint-antoine in paris
0	what decision did he come to ?
0	this knob , which was round and of polished brass , shone like a terrible star for him
0	nevertheless , he held himself very erect , in case any one should be looking at him from behind
0	at schoenbrunn there was a little shadow , aged four , whom it was seditious to call the king of rome
0	two card players were disputing , --
0	in any case , he was content
0	this engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide , and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man
0	nevertheless , if the inhabitants of the town , or strangers , or any chance comers , curious to see his tulips , rang at his little cottage , he opened his door with a smile
0	the sun is beautiful , is it not ?
0	in the meantime , the king had approached the second prisoner , who was perspiring in great drops : your name ?
0	he had been proscribed , a wanderer , poor
0	it was lucky for jondrette , that this had occurred to him , for at the very moment , m leblanc turned to him , and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name : -i see that you are greatly to be pitied , monsieur -- fabantou , replied jondrette quickly
0	the rope ladder was still shaking
0	what shall we say to her ?
0	sir , said he , what i have to say to you is this , that i adore that child
0	he dropped into a chair , with his head and both elbows on his bed , absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp , and as though a prey to vertigo
0	he spread the mattress on the flagging and said , sleep
0	he thought that he had been traced and followed
0	having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign , on board a pinnace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast , he fell into a wasps'-nest of seven or eight english vessels
0	on the way , he saw in an alley of the rue mouffetard , a child 's coffin , covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs , and illuminated by a candle
0	the first has the whole heavens in his eyes ; the last , enigmatical though he may be , has still , beneath his eyelids , the pale beam of the infinite
0	he interdicted wine , and portioned out the brandy
0	people in the village said : -those thenardiers are good people
0	how do you amuse yourself ?
0	the ill will of events had declared itself long before
0	you will break those fetters , you will flee
0	all at once you feel yourself clutched ; all is over
0	these bernardines were attached , in consequence , not to clairvaux , like the bernardine monks , but to citeaux , like the benedictine monks
0	that is what explains and excuses bonapartist liberalism
0	cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta , her robe of binche guipure , a veil of english point , a necklace of fine pearls , a wreath of orange flowers ; all this was white , and , from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth
0	this orchard is sentient , like others , in the month of may
0	one of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness ?
0	any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before
0	she earned a little also
0	these combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of spectres , silhouettes of men on horseback , the black profiles of cannon , the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages , the colossal death's-head , which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke , in the depths of the battle , advanced upon them and gazed at them
0	it was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal
0	i have passed fifteen years here in this cellar , without a fire in winter
0	die ! exclaimed the amorous captain , what are you saying , my lovely angel ?
0	it is of these three vapors , beer , brandy , and absinthe , that the lead of the soul is composed
0	certainly there is , said the old woman
0	under the caesars , there was no insurrection , but there was juvenal
0	why are you doing that at the gate ?
0	this terror was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained in him
0	but one thing remains for you to do : to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you
0	the three women had not yet uttered a single word ; they dared not speak , even in a low voice
0	she had returned to the rue de la chanvrerie herself
0	take your foot away , or we will see !
0	at the court of assizes
0	she regained , for the purpose of addressing jean valjean , inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl
0	dom claude , buried in his own thoughts , no longer listened to him
0	i will give all the money you require
0	if it had not been for that , i could not have gone out , and everything would have gone wrong !
0	thus churches , palaces , fortresses , had the earth half way up their bodies
0	you are so beautiful !
0	i ’ d rather give suck to a vampire
0	she proceeded alone to the window
0	let 's have a look at the lass
0	so you do not live down there any more ?
0	it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras d'asse and -- i have forgotten the name
0	good , now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle
0	for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter
0	the eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star
0	and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared
0	he was displeased with himself
0	one bed only was made up , and seemed to be waiting some one , and this was jean valjean 's bed
0	his march , far from being retarded by his singing , was accelerated by it
0	let us leave it as it is
0	they seemed almost extinguished at intervals , then lighted up again and shone like stars
0	when only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened , to such a degree that , at times , one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all
0	on looking more closely , he perceived that the circle was much larger than was required simply for the purpose of getting warm at the king ’ s fire , and that this concourse of people had not been attracted solely by the beauty of the hundred fagots which were burning
0	he has just taken his departure
0	on each one of its concentric walls , the priests could read the word translated and manifested to the eye , and thus they followed its transformations from sanctuary to sanctuary , until they seized it in its last tabernacle , under its most concrete form , which still belonged to architecture : the arch
0	in that case , we are at your service , said the host
0	from the chime in the spire , over the intersection of the aisles and nave , to the great bell of the front , he cherished a tenderness for them all
0	to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her
0	this question , which was simple for cosette , was profound for jean valjean
0	marius no longer went to see any one , but he sometimes encountered father mabeuf by chance
0	they already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love
0	the range of his embrace was immense
0	before entering fantine 's room , he had sister simplice summoned
0	you are , nevertheless , tolerably poor ?
0	the girl 's no fool , said thenardier
0	well , sister , rejoice , said the priest , icy as a sepulchral statue ; that is the one whom you are about to see die
0	the proprietor had a fine nickname : he was called rousseau the aquatic
0	thousands of glances directed by the people on each face upon the dais , a thousand whispers over each name
0	he raised his head
0	sir , said marius , he was my father
0	no , said fauchelevent , the difficulty is to get out
0	she panted with a sort of painful rattle ; sobs contracted her throat , but she dared not weep , so afraid was she of the thenardier , even at a distance : it was her custom to imagine the thenardier always present
0	so much the worse , i do not care
0	he might have kept it all , he had restored it all
0	it was the husband and wife taking counsel together
0	the prussian cavalry , newly arrived , dashes forwards , flies , hews , slashes , kills , exterminates
0	it 's time to skim the pot
0	( a conversation between lovers is a very commonplace affair
0	this can not be allowed to pass in this fashion
0	was this a revolution , in fact ?
0	did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder ?
0	all this was true ; but this trap , this ramshackle old vehicle , this thing , whatever it was , ran on its two wheels and could go to arras
0	when suchet says : -- capitulate , -- palafox replies : after the war with cannon , the war with knives
0	this mourning was noticed in the town , and commented on
0	moreover , he had not yet uttered a word or breathed a syllable
0	this spacious hall , illuminated by a single lamp , was the old hall of the episcopal palace , and served as the large hall of the palace of justice
0	if you only knew how pretty the garden is now !
0	what results flowed from the second ?
0	now , pursued the inspector , there is not a minute more to be lost by any one
0	the two teeth had been extracted
0	the soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity
0	we will not conduct the reader either to the mayor 's office or to the church
0	where did you enter ?
0	the culminating point of this sweep of walls was the papal gate , that is to say , near the present site of the pantheon
0	it is old , and its gristles have become bony , said another
0	he quitted the rue des filles-du-calvaire , and returned to the rue de l'homme arme
0	jean valjean had no experience of these miseries , the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted ; the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of cosette 's silence
0	the hull had received no damage on the starboard , but some of the planks had been unnailed here and there , according to custom , to permit of air entering the hold
0	she asked it of us ; that is to say , commanded us
0	saint matthew points them out : duties towards god ( matt
0	the subject is historical , and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire ; the style , i think , is natural , laconic , and may have some merit
0	how many blushing choristers , how many youthful abbes bear on their heads perrette 's pot of milk !
0	in the meantime , jehan frollo , elevating his curly blonde head above the crowd ( he had mounted upon the shoulders of robin poussepain for the purpose ) , shouted : come and look , gentle ladies and men !
0	a bell , which had the air of an appeal , was ringing in the distance
0	at the further extremity , through a glass door , he saw two small , very white beds
0	no decay is possible to the diamond
0	in front of notre-dame , and very near at hand , three streets opened into the cathedral square , -- a fine square , lined with ancient houses
0	a man 's whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents
0	and the striking thing about it was , that that also meant : enter my wine-shop
0	thus three results ensued from one idea
0	the man resumed , in that voice which he strove to render indifferent , and in which there lingered a tremor : -what if one were to rid you of her ?
0	he felt as though made of stone and too heavy to flee
0	at what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow ?
0	the following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point was carried
0	make haste , said courfeyrac , in another quarter of an hour it will be too late
0	my project had its terrible sides which made me shrink back
0	in the hope of madame la comtesse , she has the honor to be , madame , with profound respect , mistress balizard
0	his house in the rue filles-du-clavaire belonged to him , as we have already stated
0	there was no one but himself in this cross-lane
0	that is exactly like one of your ideas !
0	so much the worse
0	he said in a very low tone , she must be cold now
0	do you promise us that this mystery will be fine ?
0	when it is necessary to carry letters , to go to houses , to inquire from door to door , to find out an address , to follow any one , i am of service
0	leave her time to see the sun !
0	pologne , catalogue , valogne , i always confound those three provinces , one thing is certain , that they are gypsies
0	paris without a king has as result the world without despots
0	a cold wind was blowing from the plain
0	the young girl wept , for she wished greatly to embrace her sister
0	courfeyrac took a survey , and exclaimed : -he 's following a man !
0	a last , almost selfish thought , and less heroic than the rest , but which was intolerable to him
0	by the way , brother claude , a form for not breathing
0	all at once , thenardier addressed the prisoner : by the way , monsieur fabre , i might as well say it to you at once
0	what had become of the agent himself ?
0	they were in possession of other indications ; they laid hand on the three prowlers , and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of brujon 's machinations
0	is not monsieur le maire going to have her child brought back to her ?
0	cosette , i guess it
0	the rue polonceau ended there ; rue petit-picpus passed on , and ascended towards the lenoir market
0	a goodly number of curious , good people had been shivering since daybreak before the grand staircase of the palace ; some even affirmed that they had passed the night across the threshold of the great door , in order to make sure that they should be the first to pass in
0	with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave , all that he should be obliged to take up once more
0	master jacques charmolue approached the gypsy with a very sweet smile
0	the grandfather absolutelywasted his poor old smile
0	a tolerably long silence ensued
0	the revolution snubbed it soundly
0	she was the child who had said , on the boulevard the evening before : i bolted , bolted , bolted !
0	if you only knew !
0	it was of this rabble that saint jerome was thinking , no doubt , and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs , when he uttered this mysterious saying : fex urbis , lex orbis , -- the dregs of the city , the law of the earth
0	that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration , as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last
0	black as ovens , indeed !
0	at the convent of the rue du temple , in particular , which belonged , in truth , to another order , the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains , and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor , whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames , a portrait of a benedictine nun with unveiled face , painted bouquets , and even the head of a turk
0	happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only
0	she was in paris
0	this movement was like a flash of lightning
0	i shall go to some place where i can see you without your seeing me : it will be better so
0	revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature , and which , as it eddies about , mounts , descends , thunders , tears , razes , crushes , demolishes , uproots , bearing with it great natures and small , the strong man and the feeble mind , the tree trunk and the stalk of straw
0	all at once he raised his voice
0	one day tholomyes took the three others aside , with the gesture of an oracle , and said to them : -fantine , dahlia , zephine , and favourite have been teasing us for nearly a year to give them a surprise
0	m madeleine did not reply
0	monsieur -- have you come to beg my pardon ?
0	in these architectures it seems as though the rigidity of the dogma had spread over the stone like a sort of second petrifaction
0	babeuf is a speculator to cartouche ; marat is an aristocrat to schinderhannes
0	what matters it what threatens our head or our purse !
0	these two words furnish a tolerably good profile of her
0	while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome , we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty , his proud opposition , his just but perilous resistance to the all-powerful napoleon
0	does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence , while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence ?
0	one evening when the curfew was sounding from all the belfries in paris , the sergeants of the watch might have observed , had it been granted to them to enter the formidable court of miracles , that more tumult than usual was in progress in the vagabonds ’ tavern , that more drinking was being done , and louder swearing
0	my beautiful love , resumed phoebus , tenderly , what nonsense is this ?
0	he , javert , had seen fit to decide , contrary to all the regulations of the police , contrary to the whole social and judicial organization , contrary to the entire code , upon a release ; this had suited him ; he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public ; was not this unjustifiable ?
0	all day long , he buried himself in social questions , salary , capital , credit , marriage , religion , liberty of thought , education , penal servitude , poverty , association , property , production and sharing , the enigma of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill with darkness ; and at night , he gazed upon the planets , those enormous beings
0	especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up , said grantaire
0	immediately after champmathieu had been set at liberty , the district-attorney shut himself up with the president
0	now i own your work ; play , my child
0	twas she who dealt the death-blow to my mystery this morning , tis she who saves my life this evening !
0	she dragged herself across the damp floor , among the muddy boots of all those men , without rising , with clasped hands , and taking great strides on her knees
0	i swear to you by the good god that i was not to blame !
0	the prosiness of the originators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement
0	after listening for a few minutes , a young lad , to whom no one had paid any heed , detached himself from the group and ran off
0	the work was incomplete , i admit : we demolished the ancient regime in deeds ; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas
0	what are you saying ?
0	it was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene
0	with the aid of god , and of the prince , she entered
0	the victim was bound upon this wheel , on his knees , with his hands behind his back
0	let us live merrily
0	for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner
0	he , like fauchelevent , counted on father mestienne
0	chapter i an impartial glance at the ancient magistracy
0	there arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets , pierced and built for the fertile circulation of interests and ideas , and which are not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war
0	who is there who is not fifty years old ?
0	the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle
0	he was sought among the dead , he was not there
0	what did they want of her , good god !
0	a man was seated in the arm-chair , and bending over the table
0	pray , believe , enter into life : the father is there
0	it is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of its progress
0	cosette was between them , subjected to their double pressure , like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers
0	in both quarters , women wrung their hands ; the waves for the first , the grave for the last ; here the drowned , there the buried
0	there , within the limits of those few square fathoms , fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour
0	only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament
0	the halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory sense : a troop on the march , that is to say , movement ; a stand , that is to say , repose
0	everything else seemed to him very stupid
0	by the way , this is his hour
0	yes , lord , they have just dashed his head before my eyes on the stone of thine house , and it is because of me , because of this woman , because of her
0	i am not such a fool
0	at the moment when jean valjean entered the redoubt , no one had noticed him , all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms
0	he urged the rich to give to the poor , in order to avoid hell , which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable , and to win paradise , which he represented as charming and desirable
0	gavroche , habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters , had everything about him
0	the person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me
0	do i deny it ?
0	gringoire asked himself with some uneasiness
0	it was , in fact , the king ’ s physician ; a person about fifty years of age , whose harsh physiognomy was modified only by a crafty eye
0	let the reader imagine all these grotesque figures of the pont neuf , those nightmares petrified beneath the hand of germain pilon , assuming life and breath , and coming in turn to stare you in the face with burning eyes ; all the masks of the carnival of venice passing in succession before your glass , -- in a word , a human kaleidoscope
0	all was harmonious ; nothing was too much alive ; speech hardly amounted to a breath ; the newspapers , agreeing with the salons , seemed a papyrus
0	the cathedral was a place of refuge
0	add individual tortures to national degradations , and , whoever you may be , you will shudder before the frock and the veil , -- those two winding-sheets of human devising
0	you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist
0	a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them ; but she did not smile
0	on the following day , he said to m gillenormand : -i have arranged a hunting-party with some friends
0	i swear to you , comrades
0	i tore the cloth from the altar , it is true ; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country
0	his destitution became known there
0	he had expected nothing of the sort
0	his wife was talking to him in a low tone
0	yes , but the house is closed , said one of the drinkers
0	he occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor , between street and gardens , furnished to the very ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes ; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the arm-chairs
0	i shall have my lever
0	i always have loved my black corner
0	the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog , which is killed by the mother because , otherwise , as he grew up , he would devour the other little ones
0	tholomyes , remarked blachevelle , contemplate my calmness [ mon calme ]
0	this cavern is below all , and is the foe of all
0	you will carry her out ?
0	marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade
0	but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment
0	he took a sheet of paper , on which he wrote : these are the two tips of my iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from little gervais , which i mentioned at the court of assizes , and he arranged this piece of paper , the bits of iron , and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen on entering the room
0	three human hearts differently constructed
0	i will learn gratian by heart , i will believe firmly in god , i will be a regular pythagoras of science and virtue
0	who were in need of him possibly !
0	sometimes , in the evening , she heard a voice , concealed beneath the wind screen of the bell tower , singing a sad , strange song , as though to lull her to sleep
0	our territory was invaded , i defended it ; france was menaced , i offered my breast
0	it is the dark moment when two clouds come together
0	at the moment when he passed , -- under the cannon of the place , -- he felt his heart beat wildly
0	when she withdrew her head from the window , her countenance was inundated with tears
0	she threw herself upon it , she tried to hold it back ; she scratched the stone with her nails , but the massive block , set in movement by six men , escaped her and glided gently to the ground along the iron levers
0	only , in this case , it was claude who was erect and the obelisk which was lying down ; but , as the river , reflecting the sky , prolonged the abyss below him , the immense promontory seemed to be as boldly launched into space as any cathedral spire ; and the impression was the same
0	war is qualified only by its object
0	he believed in the straight line ; a respectable optical illusion which ruins many a man
0	that is evident , said theodule
0	this is not my house ; it is the house of jesus christ
0	marius went through his years of college , then he entered the law school
0	i will not remain long
0	i present you my compliments
0	why did you not apply to me ?
0	this fact , singular though it may seem , was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of number
0	my child , said the man , take these , and go and dress yourself quickly
0	the first part is a garden , the second is an orchard , the third is a wood
0	dahlia , zephine , and especially favourite , could not have said as muchthere had already been more than one episode in their romance , though hardly begun ; and the lover who had borne the name of adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second , and gustave in the third
0	this mixture is a confession
0	that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of saint-sulpice , who had often observed this man gazing at his child , and the scar on his cheek , and the large tears in his eyes
0	in truth , people no longer sit thus on their banners , i assure you
0	they pass their time playing dominoes
0	he still had the breathlessness of out of doors
0	the crisis was at hand
0	in the tap-room there remained only mabeuf under his black cloth and javert bound to his post
0	only one easy arm-chair , very magnificent , was to be seen ; the wood was painted with roses on a red ground , the seat was of ruby cordovan leather , ornamented with long silken fringes , and studded with a thousand golden nails
0	how true that is !
0	rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort
0	their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it
0	now the judge had plenty of proofs against la esmeralda
0	the conventionary began to pant ; the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice ; still , there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes
0	who would recognize him now ?
0	the entablature was mathematically parallel with the base
0	the campagna of rome is one idea , the banlieue of paris is another ; to behold nothing but fields , houses , or trees in what a stretch of country offers us , is to remain on the surface ; all aspects of things are thoughts of god
0	in the battle of waterloo there is something more than a cloud , there is something of the meteor
0	since it is you
0	m gillenormand trembled as he took the letter , read it , tore it in four pieces , and threw it into the waste-basket
0	he said to himself with a shudder , good god !
0	he , on his side , habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome , retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman
0	i say that jean valjean and m madeleine are one and the same man , and i say that javert had no other assassin than javert
0	one was constantly conscious of the presence of a spirit of noise and caprice , who sang through all those mouths of brass
0	to which of the gulfs did he nod his head ?
0	a brazier of damnation , a hell
0	it was madame thenardier
0	javert , with his powerful rectitude of instinct , went straight to the bridge of austerlitz
0	after the taking of la haie-sainte the battle wavered
0	my work will not permit it
0	tis a debt that you are discharging
0	he took an immense amount of snuff , and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand
0	i have my service door which opens on the courtyard
0	why was he in these woods ?
0	i am capable of that
0	above all things , do not open the door
0	marius pontmercy pursued some studies , as all children do
0	her eye was black in consequence of a blow from madame thenardier 's fist , which caused the latter to remark from time to time , how ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye !
0	i am right , am i not ?
0	what had taken place may be related in a few words
0	the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town
0	at the expiration of a few moments , the door of the retreat had opened again , then closed upon the five personages whom the reader has seen at the beginning of this chapter , and who resumed their places , their whispered conversations , and their attitudes
0	they are getting their own men killed and they are using up our ammunition for nothing
0	there 's always a petard in a seminary fellow
0	my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison
0	each day has its own great grief or its little care
0	parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices , which possess , however , a reality of their own
0	then , it was in the month of march , the days were growing longer , the winter was departing , the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness ; then came april , that daybreak of summer , fresh as dawn always is , gay like every childhood ; a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that it is
0	as at the voice of christ , ut voci christi , at a gesture , at the first sign , ad nutum , ad primum signum , immediately , with cheerfulness , with perseverance , with a certain blind obedience , prompte , hilariter , perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia , as the file in the hand of the workman , quasi limam in manibus fabri , without power to read or to write without express permission , legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia
0	would you like to make your pope after the fashion of my country ?
0	as you treat our people in your abode , so we treat you in ours !
0	and then , remarked the elder timidly , -- he alone dared talk to gavroche , and reply to him , a spark might fall in the straw , and we must look out and not burn the house down
0	it was quite simple that marius should admire her , since he adored her
0	this was what marius perceived most clearly of all
0	then she dropped her arms in discouragement , and remained seated , with lowered head , eyes fixed on the ground , mute and still trembling
0	once as he sat with his knees pressed together , and his eyes almost closed , in a despondent attitude , his daughter ventured to say to him : -father , are you as angry with him as ever ?
0	when the bishop succeeded to this apartment , after the hospital patients , he had found these portraits there , and had left them
0	there is in america , in a district near panama , a village called la joya
0	effrontery is a disgrace
0	schools and legions clashed together
0	he seized the candle in his fist , and set it on the chimney-piece with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished , and the tallow bespattered the wall
0	before going to the galleys , i was a poor peasant , with very little intelligence , a sort of idiot ; the galleys wrought a change in me
0	why this is terrible !
0	however , the darkness might have misled him ; jean valjean 's death was official ; javert cherished very grave doubts ; and when in doubt , javert , the man of scruples , never laid a finger on any one 's collar
0	as she was about to resume her seat there , she observed on the spot which she had quitted , a tolerably large stone which had , evidently , not been there a moment before
0	the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him
0	fauchelevent went towards the door
0	she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands
0	this extraordinary cavalry petrified clinton , who had seen talavera and badajoz
0	an uproar broke out among the audience , and was communicated to the jury ; it was evident that the man was lost
0	i will attend to it
0	tis very possible that he is right , madman as he is , doctor jacques , replied his comrade in the same low tone , and with a bitter smile
0	these fashions come up again , said he , ancient things are the rage , and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood
0	what do you want with no
0	favourite clapped her hands on their departure
0	because it is daring
0	we may be stopped ; the fact may be put to us in general terms , which is one way of attenuating it ; we may be told , that all trades , professions , it may be added , all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence , have their own slang
0	passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none
0	and here is the lantern
0	i am a wood-louse , monseigneur
0	let them hang you , then , and say thank you !
0	this grand little soul had taken its flight
0	for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light
0	he said at times : but i am eighty ; as though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books
0	then all three , jostling each other at poor gringoire ’ s heels , began to sing their song to him , --
0	science alone knows well how to hollow , wither , and dry up human faces ; she needs not to have old age bring her faces already furrowed
0	tis a fine breast to suck
0	the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden , which was much lower than the level of the rue polonceau , which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside
0	she remained thus prostrate for a very long time , trembling in truth , more than praying , chilled by the ever-closer breath of that furious multitude , understanding nothing of this outburst , ignorant of what was being plotted , what was being done , what they wanted , but foreseeing a terrible issue
0	and then , throwing out your chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl , with stays under your cuirass , is doubly ridiculous
0	his workmen , in particular , adored him , and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity
0	fauchelevent made , with his left hand , that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject
0	they dragged him off
0	my poor children , you will not have a sou !
0	she took his hand and laid it on her heart
0	waterloo , moreover , is the strangest encounter in history
0	lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name
0	if any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the republic in his presence , he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning
0	he did not know where he stood
0	the old dame , who was watching this scene , felt offended , without understanding why
0	on arriving at the top , he left his candle on the top step of his stairs , opened his door with very little noise , went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling , then returned for his candle and re-entered his room
0	how true it is that the beloved being becomes god
0	a disagreeable moment , a toll-gate , the passage of little to nothingness
0	in order to understand what is about to follow , the reader must remember , that , at that epoch , the bastille guard-house was situated at the other end of the square , and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel
0	i do not know how the government arranges that , but , on my word of honor , sir , i am not jacobin , sir , i am not a bousingot
0	then the bourgeois shouts : long live the people !
0	pay attention to what i am saying to you , swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know !
0	if there did not exist some one who loved , the sun would become extinct
0	only one was to be seen at a time
0	how much will you give me for it ?
0	had its places of asylum
0	every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away
0	the door was plainly double-locked
0	that is settled , father fauchelevent
0	he was , in fact , no longer at the window
0	the mayor turned livid
0	from a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts , which he tore in pieces
0	one would say that it punished you for comprehending it ; but no , it rewards you ; for it places you in a hell , where you feel god beside you
0	is it you , peasant ?
0	there is a thief , a brigand , a convict named jean valjean !
0	the bishop sighed deeply
0	this was at toulon
0	then , do not crunch sugar , and you will live
0	fires , around which swarmed strange groups , blazed here and there
0	there were moments when he looked as if not daring to touch her , even with his breath
0	thirdly : the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance , is good , but , on important occasions , it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other , so that , in case one agent should , for any cause , grow weak in his service , the other may supervise him and take his place
0	he did not know what had become of his wife and children
0	she remembered that she had been condemned to death for murder committed on the person of phoebus de châteaupers
0	who gave me such a father as that ?
0	if i continued to be monsieur fauchelevent , that would arrange everything
0	this man , this rash individual , was the man with the bald brow , who , a moment earlier , standing with the gypsy ’ s group had chilled the poor girl with his words of menace and of hatred
0	her glory consisted in her caps , which were always white
0	all at once the gypsy started , a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes , she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the place with anguish , exclaiming : phoebus !
0	the bars held firm
0	she was born at m sur m of what parents ?
0	his nature was thus constituted
0	he made but seldom and brief appearance in his good city of paris , since there he did not feel about him enough pitfalls , gibbets , and scotch archers
0	he resolved on this ; he recognized with anguish , the fact that it was necessary
0	at the same time , the intermittent clash of the iron butts of the beadles ’ halberds , gradually dying away among the columns of the nave , produced the effect of a clock hammer striking the last hour of the condemned
0	there is no doubt that , had they not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory
0	we know well what you are ; we know well that you are all brave , parbleu !
0	it was necessary that i should go away
0	at this moment , midday sounded
0	he does not believe in astrology
0	happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep
0	in this vault , men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for toulon
0	it is only such cities that become capitals
0	in the meantime , the recluse had not uttered another word since tristan had seen her daughter and all hope was lost
0	from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon , m l'abbe mabeuf
0	he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract
0	alexander called him my sleeplessness
0	the anterior portion of the ball was occupied by the crowd ; on the right and left were magistrates and tables ; at the end , upon a platform , a number of judges , whose rear rank sank into the shadows , sinister and motionless faces
0	one of the conquered
0	i will not speak to you of her joy ; it was a fury of tears , and caresses , and kisses
0	you can not supply it with the breath which it lacks
0	the lover is the priest ; the ravished virgin is terrified
0	phoebus , on his side , had not fled far
0	such was m luc-esprit gillenormand , who had not lost his hair , -- which was gray rather than white , -- and which was always dressed in dog 's ears
0	you shall help us
0	this person carried a package -- something square , like a large box or a small trunk
0	there is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye , and become roses all at once
0	next he searched his waistcoat , found a purse and pocketed it
0	every one in the house was still asleep
0	and then , we must be cautious
0	we all have a mother , -- the earth
0	i do not know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch , and go ghi , ghi , ghi , the whole time
0	there is no need to ask permission
0	more than once , in the choir , at the hour of the offices , his neighbor in the stalls had heard him mingle with the plain song , _ad omnem tonum_ , unintelligible parentheses
0	jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof , still holding fast to cosette , reached the linden-tree , and leaped to the ground
0	to see her and not to embrace her !
0	now we are going to touch up the revolution of number
0	i have committed a blunder
0	here it is , said the soldier
0	marius resumed : -now that i think of it , you ought to know my address : something might happen , one never knows ; i live with that friend named courfeyrac , rue de la verrerie , no
0	i will buy that pair of stockings , replied the man , and , he added , drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket , and laying it on the table , i will pay for them
0	then he returned to the town-hall , and the clerk observed him attentively examining a road map of france which hung in his study
0	this fanaticism was neither a dogma , nor an idea , nor an art , nor a science ; it was a man : enjolras
0	so they emancipate themselves , break the yoke of the architect , and take themselves off , each one in its own direction
0	he did , indeed , catch an inkling of illegitimacy , the history of fantine had always seemed to him equivocal ; but what was the use of talking about that ?
0	in fact , he had , for some time past , been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on cosette 's sweet face
0	he went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety , and because , as he loved the faces of men , but hated their noise , he found them assembled and silent only in church
0	the exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack
0	if it is my age that you wish to know , said quasimodo , i think that i shall be twenty at saint martin ’ s day
0	he hastened his steps
0	the idea of living in a mountainous country , and not even having lights in the streets at night !
0	the past is very strong , it is true , at the present moment
0	they ate each other somewhat , it is true , which is the misery of evil mixed with good ; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach
0	the churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part
0	does it require many drugs ?
0	he had placed himself in that position in order to spare the young girl , as far as possible , the displeasure of seeing him
0	many arrange to fight in a sitting posture
0	feudal and monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood
0	this good bourgeois king preferred the bastille with a tiny chamber and couch
0	dom claude made his arm-chair describe a quarter circle , and gazed intently at jehan
0	i do not need them
0	his name was louis philippe d'orleans
0	i have my scrivener 's stall in the market of the rue de sevres
0	at the sight of this line of cuirassed backs , undulating as they rose through the gloom , one would have pronounced it a serpent with steel scales , which was raising itself erect in front of the church
0	he merely noticed that she had grown sad , and he grew gloomy
0	it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday , our breakfast of yesterday , our dinner of to-day , and all that at once , and this morning
0	and she has so sweet and good an air !
0	the successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we renounce all attempts at depicting
0	she patched her bodice , which was old and worn out , with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement
0	we must admit that she was not much grieved by this voluntary absence on the part of the poor hunchback
0	he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago
0	passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom
0	it was clear that that was what he ought to do
0	one thing is certain , and that is , that there was not a soul in the crowd , not even himself , though in turn triumphant and the sufferer , who set forth this combination clearly in his thought
0	at this absolute assertion , the jondrette woman raised her large , red , blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression
0	a silence fell upon them
0	i should like to go and establish myself at la joya
0	o favourite , thou hast ionian lips
0	i do not belong to any family of men
0	but this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women , madame courtin , marquise de boucs , and the comtesse de chateauvieux
0	make a whirlwind of the idea
0	there appears , in the humid mist , the rat which seems the product to which paris has given birth
0	his heart contracted within him
0	jean valjean felt completely reassured
0	the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street ; it afforded shelter from the bullets , the grape-shot , and all eyes , and a few square feet of space
0	m agier laid down the law in them
0	he was in sympathy with but two things in this world : notre-dame and claude frollo
0	enjolras brought the square coffer , and courfeyrac opened it
0	and what makes you think that he will come ?
0	jehan , complaints are brought me about you every day
0	it has been a sepulchre , it has served as an asylum
0	but it is cold here
0	at the prefecture of police in paris
0	when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there
0	in number , five years after his arrival in m sur m , the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling , the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous , that the king again appointed him mayor of the town
0	this road , through which cosette had passed , excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary
0	gudule made an effort and said , --
0	sometimes he asked her : -what is the matter with you ?
0	he would have perished at thermopylae with leonidas , and burned at drogheda with cromwell
0	recall these impressions , and you will readily appreciate what gringoire felt on contemplating , beneath her visible and palpable form , that esmeralda of whom , up to that time , he had only caught a glimpse , amidst a whirlwind of dance , song , and tumult
0	but in vain ; he did not die
0	it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man 's buff between the four letters , and that they were making sport of him
0	death of the devil !
0	you are the captain , leave me my child !
0	every time that that young viper passes in front of my cell , she sets my blood in a ferment
0	he knew well that he had only to come back , and that i had been recalling him for years , and that i remained by my fireside , with my hands on my knees , not knowing what to do , and that i was mad over it !
0	no , let us not mix their corpses with our own
0	a moment later , squarely planted in the very middle of the street , astride of the gutter , the piece was ready for action
0	after so doing | | | | || you will tear it up
0	jean valjean set out on a run , in the direction which he had first taken
0	this man , whose costume was concealed by the crowd which surrounded him , did not appear to be more than five and thirty years of age ; nevertheless , he was bald ; he had merely a few tufts of thin , gray hair on his temples ; his broad , high forehead had begun to be furrowed with wrinkles , but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary youthfulness , an ardent life , a profound passion
0	he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man
0	the sun is on the point of setting
0	why , i am covering my melons , of course !
0	he had given to cosette a robe of binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother
0	the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger , the suppuration of large wounds being always liable to become re-absorbed , and consequently , to kill the sick man , under certain atmospheric conditions ; at every change of weather , at the slightest storm , the physician was uneasy
0	babet , said thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel , why did you bring so many ; they were not needed
0	one is conscious of something hideous , as though one 's soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness
0	behold how , beginning with the discovery of printing , architecture withers away little by little , becomes lifeless and bare
0	the driver halted , winked , and held out his left hand to marius , rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb
0	to-day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins
0	while she was forgetful of him , he had found her again !
0	let us set out again on the quest
0	the difference between the visible and the palpable , between the fluid and the solid in the same substance , between water and ice , nothing more
0	at half-past three o'clock in the morning , he lost one illusion ; officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any movement
0	therapontigonus miles could walk arm in arm with vadeboncoeur the grenadier , damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among bric-a-brac merchants , vincennes could grasp socrates in its fist as just as agora could imprison diderot , grimod de la reyniere discovered larded roast beef , as curtillus invented roast hedgehog , we see the trapeze which figures in plautus reappear under the vault of the arc of l'etoile , the sword-eater of poecilus encountered by apuleius is a sword-swallower on the pontneuf , the nephew of rameau and curculio the parasite make a pair , ergasilus could get himself presented to cambaceres by d'aigrefeuille ; the four dandies of rome : alcesimarchus , phoedromus , diabolus , and argyrippus , descend from courtille in labatut 's posting-chaise ; aulus gellius would halt no longer in front of congrio than would charles nodier in front of punchinello ; marto is not a tigress , but pardalisca was not a dragon ; pantolabus the wag jeers in the cafe anglais at nomentanus the fast liver , hermogenus is a tenor in the champs-elysees , and round him , thracius the beggar , clad like bobeche , takes up a collection ; the bore who stops you by the button of your coat in the tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two thousand years thesprion 's apostrophe : quis properantem me prehendit pallio ?
0	the bal mabile is not the polymnia dance of the janiculum , but the dealer in ladies ' wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes , exactly as the procuress staphyla lay in wait for the virgin planesium
0	he could barely hear the formidable tumult in the wine-shop , taken by assault , like a vague murmur overhead
0	he had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron
0	she made the movement of a bird , which thrusts its head out of its nest , glanced first at her husband , then at jean valjean , and cried to them with a smile , so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose : i will wager that you are talking politics
0	the sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood
0	no one paid any attention to him
0	rome said : you shall not take clusium
0	hence phoebus ’ s mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress esmeralda , or similar , as he called her , concerning the blow from the dagger of the bohemian or of the surly monk ( it mattered little which to him ) , and as to the issue of the trial
0	they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets ; the blows of their gun-stocks against the stones ; javert 's appeals to the police spies whom he had posted , and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished
0	rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla
0	if the man had not his card , he mentioned his name , the porter , who was sometimes in bed and asleep , rose , came out and identified the man , and opened the gate with his key ; the grave-digger stepped out , but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs
0	he drew his sword , then stammering , for anger as well as fear makes a man tremble : here !
0	the flash passed , the night closed in again ; and where was he ?
0	at the end of another minute , the carriage-load of maskers had their hands full , the multitude set to yelling , which is the crowd 's caress to masquerades ; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the throng with their comrades , and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace
0	this signature is fairly well imitated , he growled between his teeth ; however , let it go !
0	this sound , faint at first , then precise , then heavy and sonorous , approached slowly , without halt , without intermission , with a tranquil and terrible continuity
0	it was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem , whose numerous branches , bristling and leafless and as fine as threads , were covered with a million tiny white rosettes ; this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowersthere was always an admiring crowd about it
0	it 's a handy lodging
0	its explosions , its days , its masterpieces , its prodigies , its epics , go forth to the bounds of the universe , and so also do its cock-and-bull stories
0	stupefied , he turned round
0	as he spoke all tongues , he entered into all hearts
0	he dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city , far from any hamlet , far from any road , in some hidden turn of a very wild valley , no one knew exactly where
0	it 's a joke that they are playing on you , is not it
0	you are to explain many things to me
0	romulus carried off the sabines ; william carried off the saxon women ; caesar carried off the roman women
0	the bishop almost regretted having come , and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken
0	there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town to-night
0	sometimes he rides a hideous horse
0	he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des halles ; that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope , he would arrive , in less than a quarter of an hour , at some mouth on the seine between the pont au change and the pont-neuf , that is to say , he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot in paris
0	he replied in so low a tone that cosette hardly heard him : -i did not understand what you said
0	happy is he who , when the hour strikes , takes a heroic resolve , and abdicates like sylla or origenes
0	it was more than effacement , it was an eclipse
0	thanks to the traveller 's fifty-seven francs , thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature
0	when , at the turn of the gallery which opens on the roof of the side aisles , he perceived the tiny cell with its little window and its little door crouching beneath a great flying buttress like a bird ’ s nest under a branch , the poor man ’ s heart failed him , and he leaned against a pillar to keep from falling
0	and all at once , a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time , was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords , through the rue bassompierre and the boulevard bourdon , sweeping all before them
0	he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred
0	charming girl , said phoebus , do you wish to withdraw ?
0	he walked slowly , and as though crushed
0	as there will be no more satan , there will be no more michael
0	it was built by the jesuits
0	you were so audacious , master pierre ?
0	marius could not resist this sight
0	she no longer recognized it
0	that will be swallowing a tongue very fast , or a hundred sous very slowly
0	danton against louis xiv
0	they were choking and could not speak
0	no systems ; many works
0	have you your card ?
0	truly , said he , so it was not to keep me from breaking the lanterns ?
0	bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of june , number , on the occasion of the burial of young lallemand
0	the appearance exists , it is true , but i feel that he is hard up
0	they waited for it with a smile
0	at genappe , an effort was made to wheel about , to present a battle front , to draw up in line
0	all the most august , the most sublime , the most charming of humanity , and perhaps outside of humanity , have made puns
0	he must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries , bent over , weighed down , in the dark , in the cess-pool , -- more than a league and a half , sir , with a corpse upon his back !
0	the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons , but in the nations
0	but what the drama would gain thereby , truth would lose
0	some seem to be still smoking
0	marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking
0	what do you want with me ?
0	he allots the imposts , taxes each person conscientiously , judges quarrels for nothing , divides inheritances without charge , pronounces sentences gratuitously ; and he is obeyed , because he is a just man among simple men
0	all at once , the drum beat the charge
0	i ’ m above that ; i kill
0	on the first floor , hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase
0	the secret is the thing above all others
0	i do not know what was the matter with him to-day
0	he has not a sou to pay for a supper
0	a frenzied whirl enveloped them
0	growled thenardier , pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand
0	hum , said he between his gums , for he had no longer any teeth , we are already quite prepared for the door of the sepulchre
0	and if they woke her up when they took her , in vain she might cry ; i was not there ! -- ah !
0	; the pupils in the seminary , these tender levities ; errors imputed to newspapers , the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs ; etc
0	this report came under javert 's eye and set him to thinking
0	her mother had stitched and embroidered them herself ; she had lavished on them all the delicacies of her art of embroideress , and all the embellishments of a robe for the good virgin
0	here is bichot , which comes from bishop ; raille , spy , which comes from rascal , rascalion ; pilche , a case , which comes from pilcher , a sheath
0	our joys are composed of shadow
0	it is necessary that society should look at these things , because it is itself which creates them
0	the first has the whole heavens in his eyes ; the last , enigmatical though he may be , has still , beneath his eyelids , the pale beam of the infinite
0	he cast a glance towards the roof from time to time ; the gypsy did not stir any more than himself
0	she was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark
0	the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him ; he was occupied only in finding for himself , and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve
0	exclaimed dahlia and zephine
0	about seven o'clock in the morning , he had just risen and breakfasted , and was trying to settle down to work , when there came a soft knock at his door
0	on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the claws of the thenardiers , he returned to paris
0	the four young women looked at each other
0	it was customary for bishops in former days
0	worn out with fatigue , and no longer entertaining any hope , he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office
0	he was seen to run out along the yard : on arriving at the point , he fastened the rope which he had brought to it , and allowed the other end to hang down , then he began to descend the rope , hand over hand , and then , -- and the anguish was indescribable , -- instead of one man suspended over the gulf , there were two
0	later on , this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten , and all this grace ends , with the bourgeois , on two legs , and with the tomcat , on four paws
0	your name , if you please ?
0	the dead must be obeyed
0	it was something like the immobility of a bird of prey , who has just discovered a nest of sparrows , and is gazing at it
0	the future , which the emperor had rallied , made its entry
0	it ends in tragic fashion
0	why , in the first place , the other was hideous , and this one is not so bad-looking !
0	he is not the man whom you are in search of ; it is i : i am jean valjean
0	you are in a sorry case , my good fellow !
0	several moments after passing the bell chamber , he came upon a little landing-place , built in a lateral niche , and under the vault of a low , pointed door , whose enormous lock and strong iron bars he was enabled to see through a loophole pierced in the opposite circular wall of the staircase
0	this seemed profane , and the prioress forbade it
0	the king could not refrain from saying : good !
0	marius , more intent on the outside than on the interior , had not , up to that time , taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background of the tap-room
0	one evening , after he had followed them to their dwelling , and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate , he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter : -is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor , who has just come in ?
0	without her knowing why herself , and without his having any cause to accuse her of it , her soul had become so wholly her husband 's that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius ' mind became overcast in hers
0	he had been a mousquetaire , and then , he was said to be very coquettish , that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head , and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire , and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world
0	for paris is a total
0	yes , remarked gervaise , but the gypsies ?
0	no one in the garden ; no one in the house
0	this gloom pleased him ; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley , in order there to meditate at his ease , and in order that the philosopher might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet
0	it will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army ; he was in the habit of relating with exuberance , how , being a sergeant in the numberth or the numberth light something or other , at waterloo , he had alone , and in the presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars , covered with his body and saved from death , in the midst of the grape-shot , a general , who had been dangerously wounded
0	the lovers saw each other every day
0	that is what it is like
0	when , at the conclusion of all the ceremonies , after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible yesses , after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy , after having exchanged their rings , after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer , they arrived , hand in hand , admired and envied by all , marius in black , she in white , preceded by the suisse , with the epaulets of a colonel , tapping the pavement with his halberd , between two rows of astonished spectators , at the portals of the church , both leaves of which were thrown wide open , ready to enter their carriage again , and all being finished , cosette still could not believe that it was real
0	_kyrie eleison_ , said the priests , who had remained beneath the arch of the portal
0	in spite of the calm which he affected , a violent gesture betrayed his internal convulsions from time to time
0	father fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life , and who , towards the end of his days , halt , infirm , with no interest left to him in the world , found it sweet to be grateful , and perceiving a generous action to be performed , flung himself upon it like a man , who at the moment when he is dying , should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted , and should swallow it with avidity
0	police , to burn the witches !
0	the latter , as he did not see , could not be seen ; he took advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly
0	at certain moments the foot slips ; at other moments the ground crumbles away underfoot
0	there is the national guard in addition
0	the grandfather 's sovereign good humor gave the key-note to the whole feast , and each person regulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality
0	in lieu of the -- -- - above }
0	said madame de r -- -- , i have only four sous in my purse
0	legitimist tricks were hinted at ; they spoke of the duc de reichstadt , whom god had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the empire
0	questions to which there exists no reply
0	there came a second knock , as gentle as the first
0	all the cartridges having been made , and all the powder used , this table was free
0	if it is in winter , it is yonder , crawling on the carpet , it is laboriously climbing upon an ottoman , and the mother trembles lest it should approach the fire
0	here the rag-picker interposed : -ladies , business is dull
0	and , then , when one is sad , one eats less
0	god subordinated to the commissary of police ; such is the age
0	he was sleeping peacefully
0	after a silence , the priest resumed , --
0	madame magloire was , in fact , just putting the last touches to the table
0	it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius , and asked him : what is your grandson doing ?
0	then , there will be nothing more like the history of old , we shall no longer , as to-day , have to fear a conquest , an invasion , a usurpation , a rivalry of nations , arms in hand , an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings , on a birth in hereditary tyrannies , a partition of peoples by a congress , a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty , a combat of two religions meeting face to face , like two bucks in the dark , on the bridge of the infinite ; we shall no longer have to fear famine , farming out , prostitution arising from distress , misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword , and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events
0	gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue
0	-- and shielding them with his body , and facing an entire battalion alone , he made them pass in behind him
0	when he paid at the desk where madam rousseau , at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided , he gave a sou to the waiter , and madam rousseau gave him a smile
0	the mouth of a woman is constantly pure ; it is a running water , it is a ray of sunlight
0	it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more
0	but cosette 's half-million pleased the aunt , and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers were concerned
0	courfeyrac distributed them with a smile
0	it formed a resisting , massive , solid , compact , almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together , and conversing in low tones
0	the beggar raised his head , and replied in a whining voice , thanks , my good sir
0	he did not know , he who wore his heart on his sleeve , he who observed only the good old law of nature in the world , he who allowed his passions to follow their inclinations , and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry , so freely did he let it off each day by fresh drains , -- he did not know with what fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress is denied to it , how it accumulates , how it swells , how it overflows , how it hollows out the heart ; how it breaks in inward sobs , and dull convulsions , until it has rent its dikes and burst its bed
0	what 's that you are gabbling about there ?
0	do you hear me ?
0	but guillaume rym , with his polished smile , approached the usher
0	i was going to tell you some news
0	without uttering a cry , she raised herself erect with a terrible expression ; then she flung herself upon the hand of the executioner , like a beast on its prey , and bit it
0	cosette and marius beheld each other once more
0	he strives to detain the army , he recalls it to its duty , he insults it , he clings to the rout
0	he added : i insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well
0	what a child you are !
0	the bed had not been disturbed , and on the bed lay , outspread , but not defiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon
0	the passage terminated in another gut which he encountered across his path
0	the butler of the court of accounts ?
0	the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine-shop
0	a big woman , who might be forty years of age , or a hundred , was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels
0	your hands were red then , mademoiselle , they are very white now
0	on the following day , the clothes were faithfully returned , and the changer , who trusted the thieves with everything , was never robbed
0	he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him , and to depart in wrath into the gloom ; that if it had thus fled , it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future ; that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion , the war of the gutters , the war of the pavements , fusillades through cellar-windows , blows given and received in the rear ; it was because , coming from marengo and friedland , it did not wish to go to the rue de la chanvrerie ; it was because , after what it had done with the father , it did not wish to do this for the son !
0	demanded marius ; for it was he : in fact , he had just quitted his grandfather 's , and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time
0	they are of silver , but to me they are gold , they are diamonds ; they change candles which are placed in them into wax-tapers
0	he was a small man of about fifty , brisk , wrinkled , frail , yellow , brazen-faced , feverish , who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person , and an immense force in his glance
0	there are lone women , said guelemer
0	it is the hive whither come all imaginations , those golden bees , with their honey
0	this repression was not effected without some commotion , and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people
0	whence arises this fault ?
0	that they would receivesuccor about three o'clock in the morning -- that they were sure of one regiment , that paris would rise
0	napoleon is dead , said a passer-by to a veteran of marengo and waterloo
0	what a splendid destiny for a nation to be the empire of such an emperor , when that nation is france and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man !
0	he is going to paris , said the wife
0	if you were to take her away , i should say : well , and the lark , what has become of her ?
0	it is the science of muscles
0	was followed by a cry of save yourselves who can !
0	m bamatabois was one of the jurors
0	again he bent over , drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he moistened in the water and with which he then wiped marius ' blood-stained brow
0	and he raised himself to a sitting posture
0	the young men of the present day are all blackguards !
0	he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him
0	what took place during that fatal minute ?
0	he ’ ll get himself devoured !
0	the unhappy bellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold , and clasped his large , misshapen hands with a suppliant air
0	oh , the unfortunate wretches !
0	javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage
0	monsieur le maire , dispose of the old man !
0	there is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called paris ; as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium , subterranean resistances abound
0	and the hotel bill ?
0	thanks , madame , said cosette
0	when we are at the windows , the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street !
0	she was a frail , emaciated , slender creature ; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness
0	an explosion was heard , the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards
0	he wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat , which was worth many millions , being all wadded with bank-bills
0	i do not lodge poor folks for less
0	the rues saint-denis and saint-martin , with their innumerable ramifications , rose one after the other , like trees intertwining their branches ; and then the tortuous lines , the rues de la plâtrerie , de la verrerie , de la tixeranderie , etc , meandered over all
0	the boy replied : there is a cure there
0	to destroy abuses is not sufficient ; customs must be modified
0	around the hall , along the lofty wall , between the doors , between the windows , between the pillars , the interminable row of all the kings of france , from pharamond down : the lazy kings , with pendent arms and downcast eyes ; the valiant and combative kings , with heads and arms raised boldly heavenward
0	i turn to the men : gentlemen , make conquest , rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse
0	i am obliged to you for allowing me to pass one more agreeable quarter of an hour
0	marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion
0	they make one feel to what a degree architecture is a primitive thing , by demonstrating ( what is also demonstrated by the cyclopean vestiges , the pyramids of egypt , the gigantic hindoo pagodas ) that the greatest products of architecture are less the works of individuals than of society ; rather the offspring of a nation ’ s effort , than the inspired flash of a man of genius ; the deposit left by a whole people ; the heaps accumulated by centuries ; the residue of successive evaporations of human society , -- in a word , species of formations
0	they have a tradition as to everybody 's last garment
0	never to have lied , never to have said , for any interest whatever , even in indifference , any single thing which was not the truth , the sacred truth , was sister simplice 's distinctive trait ; it was the accent of her virtue
0	unable to comprehend the captain ’ s resistance , he hastened to say to him , --
0	if the sorceress is still in notre-dame , must she be seized in spite of the sanctuary ?
0	was it their fault ?
0	eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry
0	i like bald omelettes
0	the tear did not fall , it retreated , and jean valjean replaced it with a smile
0	on her side , she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the petit-picpus convent , that her mother , like his own , was dead , that her father 's name was m fauchelevent , that he was very good , that he gave a great deal to the poor , but that he was poor himself , and that he denied himself everything though he denied her nothing
0	the magnon sought an expedient
0	the man left the room , and returned almost immediately , accompanied by three others
0	certainly , despotism remains despotism , even under the despot of genius
0	she replied in a broken voice , --
0	we may depend on you ?
0	and horrible to myself -- you will not even look at me !
0	in prison , whither fresh misdeeds had led him , he had become something in the nature of a turnkey
0	the mire there comports itself with decency
0	finish both of us at one blow , said he
0	he rose and began to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door , growing ever more serene
0	you must have compassion on animals
0	he may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary ; that is to say , a participant in his own person in that revolution , that he should have lent a hand to it , that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein , that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it
0	luckily , some one came to rescue him from his embarrassment , and assume the responsibility
0	but the hand weakened and released him
0	i like you better as a lover than as a jacobin
0	you know , one does have such freaks sometimes
0	he had his knapsack on his shoulders , his cudgel in his hand , a rough , audacious , weary , and violent expression in his eyes
0	do you keep an inn ?
0	what do you wish , mademoiselle ?
0	it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn
0	now speak , what 's the matter ?
0	as the young man did not laugh constantly , fragments of the old woman ’ s ditty reached the priest ; it was something unintelligible yet frightful , --
0	the archdeacon shook his head , with a bitter smile
0	meanwhile , he had forgotten to drink
0	whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was , he could not halt there , he was irresistibly constrained to continue , to advance , to examine , to think , to march further
0	here , again , there was a magical word which it was necessary to know
0	we need all our cartridges just at present
0	hucheloup , one fine morning , had seen fit to notify passers-by of this specialty ; he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint , and as he was an orthographer on his own account , as well as a cook after his own fashion , he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription : -one winter , the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the s which terminated the first word , and the g which began the third ; this is what remained : -- carpe ho ras
0	it seems as though utopia had no longer any faith in radiance , its irresistible and incorruptible force
0	what is going on here ?
0	in another dissertation , he examines the theological works of hugo , bishop of ptolemais , great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book , and establishes the fact , that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century , under the pseudonym of barleycourt
0	they went to the porte-sainte-martin to see frederick in l'auberge des adrets
0	it was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself
0	it was something like a powerful magnetism which those vast instruments shed over her in great waves
0	a few paces more , and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere saint-jacques , that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold , that miserable and shameful place de grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society , which recoiled before the death penalty , neither daring to abolish it with grandeur , nor to uphold it with authority
0	this state of mind fatigued him
0	i regret the time when i saw bonaparte and talma enter the bel sauvage , arm in arm
0	the spattering of a lightning-flash is of the thunder also
0	a tumultuous retinue accompanied them , -- students , artists , young men affiliated to the cougourde of aix , artisans , longshoremen , armed with clubs and bayonets ; some , like combeferre , with pistols thrust into their trousers
0	in the first place , did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard , break the branch , and steal the apples ; that is to say , commit the crime of breaking in and theft ?
0	the horses take up all the space
0	they possess nothing of their own , and they must not attach themselves to anything
0	again thenardier shook him by the shoulder
0	his two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen ; he was serious , it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman
0	we have all seen that there are two of you
0	i will not do so any more !
0	lastly , at the right of the sainte-chapelle , towards the west , the palais de justice rested its group of towers at the edge of the water
0	the journey is long and costly
0	i am no beggar
0	slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it
0	at the moment when he turned round , he perceived that marius was watching his walk
0	in a week we shall be in england
0	in short , the relic was a strange one
0	fouquier-tainville is a rascal ; but what is your opinion as to lamoignon-baville ?
0	in three pieces , my boy !
0	in front of him there was another wall , a wall like night
0	get out of here , you dog !
0	it sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns ; that is to say , he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels , and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say
0	you remember her blue plush hat
0	lofty as it was , this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof , which could be seen beyond
0	many women had come thither to mourn , until their death , for relatives , lovers , faults
0	the driver 's only reply was to whistle the air of la palisse and to whip up his horse
0	he served as a connecting link between the friends of the a b c and other still unorganized groups , which were destined to take form later on
0	jean valjean , with the energy of a supreme struggle , crossed the street at one bound , entered the blind alley , broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife , and an instant later he was beside cosette once more
0	you used to call me thou , she retorted
0	i will bring him to you , he said , in a weak voice
0	the whole barricade hastened up , then all ranged themselves in a circle at a distance , feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold
0	oh , how cold it is !
0	feuilly , you will see those of the glaciere , will you not ?
0	my name is jean valjean
0	we find in them a quantity of small seed which we can not sift out , and which we are obliged to send through the mill-stones ; there are tares , fennel , vetches , hempseed , fox-tail , and a host of other weeds , not to mention pebbles , which abound in certain wheat , especially in breton wheat
0	i love you so that tis simply miraculous
0	you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
0	he came and listened at the mysterious lodger 's door , hoping to catch the sound of his voice , but jean valjean saw his candle through the key-hole , and foiled the spy by keeping silent
0	i went down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose
0	all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself , that some one had placed it there , that an arm had been thrust through the railing , and this idea appeared to alarm her
0	two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder , and the masked man with the ventriloquist 's voice took up his station in front of him , ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement
0	affiliated and initiated , they sketched out the ideal underground
0	gavroche , though shot at , was teasing the fusillade
0	he lighted his candle and mounted the stairs
0	at dessert , he said to courfeyrac
0	that is the very point that is not troublesome , exclaimed fauchelevent
0	marius quivered in every limb , he did not know what would happen next , his brain was on fire
0	the local pronunciation turns jean into chan -- he is called chan mathieu
0	it was , then , a mind which had unfolded itself there , sigh by sigh , irregularly , without order , without choice , without object , hap-hazard
0	i have inherited something in reims , in our country
0	that evening , at the usual hour , jean valjean came to the rue des filles-du-calvaire -- madame went out with monsieur and has not yet returned , basque said to him
0	he had not thought of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the rue plumet , he had not seen her again , and she had gone completely out of his mind
0	his vanguard was very feeble , and could accomplish nothing
0	a fine , flaming fagot , added the old woman
0	the mattress now hung by one thread only
0	the definitive , meditate upon that word
0	citizens , whither are we going ?
0	his first sensation was one of blindness
0	shadows have passed by
0	sire , your majesty knoweth that simon radin is dead ?
0	a barricade had been begun there and abandoned
0	the apse is of a very devout , and so peculiar a fashion that i have never beheld anything like it elsewhere !
0	as she passed before a lighted window , she made an effort , drew up suddenly , and cried out , help !
0	napoleon , on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man , turned round and said abruptly : -who is this good man who is staring at me ?
0	in the same manner that louis xviii
0	let us arrange this matter in an amicable way
0	one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs , and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people , since they did not need it
0	his wife was in bed , but she was not asleep
0	the republicans and the galley-slaves , -- they form but one nose and one handkerchief
0	at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment
0	buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast , by means of this wax , to a little framework of black iron
0	the priest heard them saying , for their voices reached him , clear and shrill : why , he will break his neck !
0	that which he had perceived in movement an instant before , in the distant darkness , was javert and his squad without a doubt
0	the thieves made him mount the stool , clopin came to him , passed the rope about his neck , and , tapping him on the shoulder , --
0	she fell face downwards upon the floor , and there was no longer any sound audible in the cell than the sob of the drop of water which made the pool palpitate amid the darkness
0	gradually , however , vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation , and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality , -- not the whole situation , but some of the details
0	it was for them a joy that was always fresh , to go out arm in arm , in the face of the sun , in the open street , without hiding themselves , before the whole world , both of them completely alone
0	they seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides
0	the giantess plays at being a dwarf ; immense france has her freaks of pettiness
0	are not you surfeited ?
0	what have we to fear , we who believe ?
0	you are voluptuous and timid !
0	; on the right , twenty others , from conflans to ville-l ’ evêque
0	insurrection , which is speedily exhausted , has only a certain number of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend
0	from vert-coucou to groentendael , for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of brussels , according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are still alive , the roads were encumbered with fugitives
0	thus , as soon as they began to batter the grand door , the shower of rough blocks of stone began to fall , and it seemed to them that the church itself was being demolished over their heads
0	a fire had been lighted in the kitchen , and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets , pewter mugs , spoons , forks , and all the brass table-ware of the establishment
0	his face was square , with a thin , firmmouth , thick , gray , and very ferocious whiskers , and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out
0	irritated convictions , embittered enthusiasms , agitated indignations , instincts of war which have been repressed , youthful courage which has been exalted , generous blindness ; curiosity , the taste for change , the thirst for the unexpected , the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play , and love , the prompter 's whistle , at the theatre ; the vague hatreds , rancors , disappointments , every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted it ; discomfort , empty dreams , ambitious that are hedged about , whoever hopes for a downfall , some outcome , in short , at the very bottom , the rabble , that mud which catches fire , -- such are the elements of revolt
0	it will be remembered that m madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal
0	it was , in truth , a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator than phoebus , to see how these beautiful maidens , with their envenomed and angry tongues , wound , serpent-like , and glided and writhed around the street dancer
0	there was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of paris in a ferment from early morning
0	his conscience ; that is to say , god
0	then madame magloire began the whole story afresh , exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact
0	from whom did it come ?
0	then he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase , and once more descended
0	the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact , and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter
0	you are going to live , and to live with us , and to live a long time
0	there is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity !
0	said gavroche , who had just closed his eyes
0	my pretty little romantic beard !
0	i have not stolen ; i picked up from the ground things that were lying there
0	madame thenardier 's countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life , and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras
0	being thus ironical and bald , he was the leaderiron is an english word
0	then he picked up his basket , replaced the cartridges which had fallen from it , without missing a single one , and , advancing towards the fusillade , set about plundering another cartridge-box
0	it weighs down , it crushes
0	there exists , at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes , a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights ; a fearful conflict , where , now cunning , now violent , unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time , it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice , and with club-blows through crime
0	we have forgotten to mention , that on the boulevard du temple this child was called little gavroche
0	in the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse
0	pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak , and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates
0	and he signed the sentence thus modified
0	basque opened the door , and beheld m fauchelevent
0	tell your husband that this shall not happen again
0	this crowd had been waiting since daybreak for three things : noonday , the embassy from flanders , the mystery play
0	retorted louis xi , with singular good humor ; the physician has more credit than you
0	do you hear me , marius !
0	they placed him on his knees on the circular plank ; he made no resistance
0	chapter i the little shoe
0	he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin
0	the merchant who says : montpellier not active , marseilles fine quality , the broker on 'change who says : assets at end of current month , the gambler who says : tiers et tout , refait de pique , the sheriff of the norman isles who says : the holder in fee reverting to his landed estate can not claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor , the playwright who says : the piece was hissed , the comedian who says : i have made a hit , the philosopher who says : phenomenal triplicity , the huntsman who says : voileci allais , voileci fuyant , the phrenologist who says : amativeness , combativeness , secretiveness , the infantry soldier who says : my shooting-iron , the cavalry-man who says : my turkey-cock , the fencing-master who says : tierce , quarte , break , the printer who says : my shooting-stick and galley , -- all , printer , fencing-master , cavalry dragoon , infantry-man , phrenologist , huntsman , philosopher , comedian , playwright , sheriff , gambler , stock-broker , and merchant , speak slang
0	the pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes , and a red flag , fastened to this pole , floated over the barricade
0	there are moments when , whatever the attitude of the body may be , the soul is on its knees
0	in short , he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him
0	paris , april number , number
0	one day i saw the senators cross the quai malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees , with hats a la henri iv
0	both remained motionless for several moments , considering in silence , she so much grace , he so much ugliness
0	she is resigned , with that resignation which resembles indifference , as death resembles sleep
0	a burning candle does not attract one gnat alone
0	both held their peace , each plunged in a gulf of thoughts
0	the great , those who are rich , are up above , in the acacia alley , which is paved
0	marius had reached this point
0	one sole resource remained to him ; to return in all haste to the rue de l'homme arme , and commit jean valjean to prison
0	favourite shrugged her shoulders
0	jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side , and yet keep watch on the light side
0	he gave a jerk , tried a crook of the knee , twisted his limbs desperately , and made efforts to escape
0	should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade ?
0	the edifices which belong exclusively to any one of these three layers are perfectly distinct , uniform , and complete
0	there was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dressshe wore a gown of mauve barege , little reddish brown buskins , whose ribbons traced an x on her fine , white , open-worked stockings , and that sort of muslin spencer , a marseilles invention , whose name , canezou , a corruption of the words quinze aout , pronounced after the fashion of the canebiere , signifies fine weather , heat , and middaythe three others , less timid , as we have already said , wore low-necked dresses without disguise , which in summer , beneath flower-adorned hats , are very graceful and enticing ; but by the side of these audacious outfits , blond fantine 's canezou , with its transparencies , its indiscretion , and its reticence , concealing and displaying at one and the same time , seemed an alluring godsend of decency , and the famous court of love , presided over by the vicomtesse de cette , with the sea-green eyes , would , perhaps , have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou , in the contest for the prize of modestythe most ingenious is , at times , the wisest
0	the marshal , levelling his glass , answered , four or five thousand men , sire ; evidently grouchy
0	the rest of us have mistresses , more or less , who make us crazy , that is to say , brave
0	this made twenty sous , which laigle handed to the lad
0	he made him dance according to his whim
0	papers could be seen inside
0	christmas of the year number was particularly brilliant at montfermeil
0	what was blindness in the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats
0	hence , the man to whom it had belonged had come thither and had died there
0	they do not eat men , they crunch them ; or , magicians that they are , they transform them into oysters and swallow them
0	outside in the place , there , were many groups conversing in low tones , as when some great plan is being framed , and here and there a knave crouching down engaged in sharpening a villanous iron blade on a paving-stone
0	it was evident that the critical moment was approaching
0	bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster , and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people , which , as we lately pointed out , resembles the imagination of children , the party of number made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession , from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque , from tiberius to the bugaboo
0	it was clothing which some charitable women had left on the threshold of the church for her
0	child , do you know that those tears are of lava ?
0	he set out to run
0	she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter ; the summer passed , but winter came again
0	she sang it in so sad a voice , and to so sweet an air , that it was enough to make any one , even a nun , weep
0	joly , who had taken widow hucheloup 's mirror from the wall , was examining his tongue in it
0	mr mayor , returned the fleming , i have just what you want
0	it was a very angular and very lively little mass , imprisoned in its linen sack , stamped with the cipher of messire guillaume chartier , then bishop of paris , with a head projecting
0	one would have said that he knew who i was
0	he could not have told
0	this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of jean valjean
0	i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair ; that one must be on one 's guard ; that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris ( there the imagination of the police , that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable ) ; that a battery had been established in the rue aubry le boucher ; that lobau and bugeaud were putting their heads together , and that , at midnight , or at daybreak at latest , four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising , the first coming from the bastille , the second from the porte saint-martin , the third from the greve , the fourth from the halles ; that perhaps , also , the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ-de-mars ; that no one knew what would happen , but that this time , it certainly was serious
0	but it was difficult to make out whether it was a child ’ s cap or a king ’ s crown , the two things bore so strong a resemblance to each other
0	he felt that the ground was solid under his feet ; that was all ; but that was enough
0	he is destroying himself !
0	he knows what he lacks
0	when many varied sensations have agitated the day , when various matters preoccupy the mind , one falls asleep once , but not a second time
0	she is not yours !
0	he passed whole days with his face close to the panes of his window
0	tis the recluse of the rat-hole
0	the district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence
0	she was touched and raised her head to answer him
0	it is probable that he did not hear them
0	it was that which lent a bad aspect to his case
0	he had but one passion -- the right ; but one thought -- to overthrow the obstacle
0	three months had elapsed
0	he was covered with blood
0	take back your ferocious beast
0	yes , they are fighting
0	behind rose the forest of spires of the palais des tournelles
0	then she looked at fantine , who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair
0	i consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold
0	well , i have made inquiries ; you will expose yourselves to no purpose , you see
0	the next morning , when marguerite entered fantine 's room before daylight , -- for they always worked together , and in this manner used only one candle for the two , -- she found fantine seated on her bed , pale and frozen
0	thou wilt not dare repeat it
0	this piqued javert 's curiosity in a decided manner
0	that 's true , excuse me !
0	then great tears fell , one by one , from her eyes ; they flowed down her cheeks through a furrow , like a torrent through a bed which it has hollowed for itself
0	it was my beard that saved us !
0	she moved the chairs about , she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode , she handled marius ' clothes , she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners
0	to live honestly by her own labor , what mercy from heaven !
0	he could return tranquilly among men
0	the gypsy was dancing ; she was twirling her tambourine on the tip of her finger , and tossing it into the air as she danced provençal sarabands ; agile , light , joyous , and unconscious of the formidable gaze which descended perpendicularly upon her head
0	since jean valjean was alone , and there was no one there
0	the foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who , in the report to the directory on aboukir , said : such a one of our balls killed six men
0	and as kindly as henri iv
0	shall it be greece ?
0	nothing could force a movement from him
0	the traveller straightened himself up
0	his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life , and had trickled there slowly , thought by thought ; for , in a character , as in a rock , there may exist apertures made by drops of water
0	the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping
0	it was clear that it was she
0	seignory pierces through sacerdotalism ; the commonality , through seignory
0	as for the watcher , the first thing he did was to fall asleep
0	thus , immediately adjoining the park des tournelles , between the rue saint-antoine and the vielle rue du temple , there stood sainte-catherine , with its immense cultivated lands , which were terminated only by the wall of paris
0	the cuirassiers hurled themselves on the english squares
0	on other occasions , courfeyrac encountered him and said : -- good morning , monsieur l'abbe !
0	cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris
0	so be it , replied enjolras
0	as for the plain itself , let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground ; each rise commands the next rise , and all the undulations mount towards mont-saint-jean , and there end in the forest
0	in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible
0	each person wished to get a better view of him
0	i remember one shrove-tuesday when she went to bed at eight o'clock
0	weeds abounded , which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land
0	the nuns even prefer , out of humility , this last expression , which contains an idea of torture and abasement
0	when quasimodo , who had not ceased to fight for a moment , beheld this rout , he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven ; then , intoxicated with joy , he ran , he ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell , the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended
0	he heard latin words , which he did not understand , pass over him , so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one : -qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere , evigilabunt ; alii in vitam aeternam , et alii in approbrium , ut videant semper
0	this note jotted down on the margin of angles ' report , we will return to our four couples
0	said the archdeacon , laying his finger on his mouth , here is master jacques
0	he followed him , and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck , side by side with the criminal bound with cords
0	he was clothed in rags , and walked with one knee bent and dragging his leg
0	then , the barricades having been built , the posts assigned , the guns loaded , the sentinels stationed , they waited , alone in those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer , surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated , enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on , in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt advancing , and which had about it something tragic and terrifying , isolated , armed , determined , and tranquil
0	fierce lynch law , with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest , for it has been applied by the republic in america , as well as by the monarchy in europe
0	resumed gavroche , so you are going to have a bout with the bobbies ?
0	how he would have embraced that white head , bathed his hair in tears , gazed upon his scar , pressed his hands , adored his garment , kissed his feet !
0	the idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police
0	one day , at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels , he had read in the messager , that a woman had just given birth to a child , who was doing well , and had a calf 's muzzle , and he exclaimed : there 's a fortune !
0	above all , he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz , he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread
0	you left this world many years ago ; you have rejoined your sisters , the virgins , and your brothers , the angels , in the light ; may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise !
0	here , contemplation is profanation
0	we should each cultivate our own little corner
0	at the entrance to the rue des prouvaires , the crowd no longer walked
0	this , taken as a whole , was very acceptable , as the reader will perceive , especially when the sum due was half a million
0	it is only half past twelve
0	her girdle was a string , her head ribbon a string , her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise , a blond and lymphatic pallor , earth-colored collar-bones , red hands , a half-open and degraded mouth , missing teeth , dull , bold , base eyes ; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth , and the look of a corrupt old woman ; fifty years mingled with fifteen ; one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible , and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep
0	the rogue is clever !
0	i will tell you
0	can you see the bride if you stoop down ?
0	he could not take his eyes from it
0	the diaphaneity of babet contrasted with the grossness of gueulemer
0	the breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees
0	if our gold is manure , our manure , on the other hand , is gold
0	i beg your pardon ; i have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove , and it has made it smoke
0	that is the least he can have
0	the one who spoke thus could not be seen
0	m gillenormand , without however allowing it to appear , observed that marius , ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness , had not once called him father
0	you look at a star for two reasons , because it is luminous , and because it is impenetrable
0	it was outlined on a faint , almost indistinct reddish glow , which vaguely empurpled the flooring vault underfoot , and the vault overhead , and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage
0	to thrust aside the stones , to raise the grating , to lift marius , who was as inert as a dead body , upon his shoulders , to descend , with this burden on his loins , and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort of well , fortunately not very deep , to let the heavy trap , upon which the loosened stones rolled down afresh , fall into its place behind him , to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the surface , -- all this was executed like that which one does in dreams , with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle ; this took only a few minutes
0	find me anything as beautiful as that !
0	it is difficult to seize darkness by the throat , and to hurl it to the earth
0	at all events , it did not prevent the archdeacon from being considered by the learned heads of the chapter , as a soul who had ventured into the vestibule of hell , who was lost in the caves of the cabal , groping amid the shadows of the occult sciences
0	the doctor , the priest , and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word ; he was the stranger there
0	a grand acclamation followed
0	hence , a thousand conflicting establishments of police ; that is to say , no police at all
0	men must be stirred up , pushed on , treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance , their eyes must be wounded by the true , light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls
0	we are doing a laudable thing in saving mademoiselle , and yet we should be hung by order of the king if we were caught
0	it seemed to him too , that , in one instant , he had become deaf
0	it seemed to him that that stroke said to him , come on !
0	the landlady of the hotel entered
0	some of them quitted the country , others abandoned the trade
0	it was the group composed of pontmercy and thenardier ; the sergeant the rescuer , the colonel rescued
0	i am at ease , because i know that if anything were to happen to him , it would be the end of me
0	this entrance , which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion , permitted a view of two things , neither of which have anything very funereal about them , -- a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines , and the face of a lounging porter
0	what do i mean to do with it , august king of thunes ?
0	perhaps fantine was within that shadow
0	races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to guide civilization
0	some traces of this geometrical plan still exist to-day
0	silent tears , terrible tears
0	jean valjean stammered : it was i who told basque to remove them
0	an irresistible magnet seemed to hold her
0	this corridor , as the reader will remember , was bordered on both sides by attics , all of which were , for the moment , empty and to let

0	eight or ten months , then , after that which is related in the preceding pages , towards the first of january , number , on a snowy evening , one of these dandies , one of these unemployed , a right thinker , for he wore a morillo , and was , moreover , warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather , was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball-dress , with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair , in front of the officers ' cafe
0	the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first
0	their prayer will not be in vain , and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir
0	djali , resumed the young girl , emboldened by her growing success , how preaches master jacques charmolue , procurator to the king in the ecclesiastical court ?
0	he reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer
0	quasimodo fixed his gaze in vain upon la esmeralda ; soon she was no more than a whiteness amid the twilight ; then nothing
0	there is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism
0	on quitting the rue des ballets at daybreak , he had returned in haste to the elephant , had artistically extracted from it the two brats , had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented , and had then gone away , confiding them to that good mother , the street , who had brought him up , almost entirely
0	we have just seen him at montfermeil
0	death is the same thing as pardon
0	in the spring of number , although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification , paris had already long been ripe for commotion
0	knot the two pieces together , we will fling him the rope , he can fasten it to the wall , and he will have enough of it to get down with
0	at the same time the thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair
0	manage so that , when you are with each other , nothing shall be lacking to you , and that cosette may be the sun for marius , and that marius may be the universe to cosette
0	i possess the hammer and the nail , and in my hands they are utensils no more formidable than a club in the hands of a maker of edge tools
0	javert went on , with a severe air and his eyes still cast down
0	the egyptians , the men of slang , and all the fraternity of law clerks , gathered howling round the priest
0	a battalion of the line whose arms were piled in the rue de la petite truanderie was on the watch on the side of the rue du cygne ; on the opposite side , the municipal guard occupied the rue des precheurs
0	paris has an aesop-mayeux , and a canidia , mademoiselle lenormand
0	wait until the day after to-morrow
0	and , said tourangeau suddenly , the wondrous result , -- have you attained it , have you made gold ?
0	they were your neighbors
0	it was an angel !
0	while the two women were whispering together , with their backs turned to fantine 's bed , the sister interrogating , the servant conjecturing , fantine , with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies , which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death , had raised herself to her knees in bed , with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster , and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains , and was listening
0	he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
0	i could not do otherwise than turn him out , said the grandfather to himself , and he asked himself : if the thing were to do over again , would i do it ?
0	meanwhile master florian , the auditor , turned over attentively the document in the complaint entered against quasimodo , which the clerk handed him , and , having thus glanced at it , appeared to reflect for a moment
0	conscious that they were about to die , they shouted , vive l'empereur !
0	so old mestienne is dead !
0	he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to make out
0	then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope , saying as she did so : -dieu de dieu !
0	if , in place of the characteristic monuments which we have just described , we examine the general aspect of art from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century , we notice the same phenomena of decay and phthisis
0	i did not give you my address with any intention of escaping from you
0	the fine-air was lighted by a skylight
0	architecture began like all writing
0	he made himself a target
0	this question caused a flash of hope to gleam before jehan ’ s eyes
0	and , in proportion as labor diminishes , needs increase
0	it was more than a chain , more than a fetter , more than a ring of iron , it was a living pair of pincers endowed with intelligence , which emerged from the wall
0	he paused : the prisoner did not break the silence , and thenardier resumed : -as soon as my wife returns and says to me : the lark is on the way , we will release you , and you will be free to go and sleep at home
0	the captain was very gallantly clad ; he had tufts of embroidery at his neck and wrists ; a great elegance at that day
0	he said to himself : how beautiful she is !
0	so her fault was now known to every one
0	how do you get in ?
0	nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal
0	the children who scrambled between their legs would have frightened as many monkeys
0	still , master of himself though he was , he could not repress a start
0	however , this quarter , which had a superannuated rather than an antique air , was tending even then to transformation
0	by the rag-pickers of the faubourg saint-antoine
0	however , we could not equal the black glass of england
0	why , no , said jean valjean
0	a profound contradiction ; for an affection is a conviction
0	she allowed herself to be called madame
0	the grand poem , the grand edifice , the grand work of humanity will no longer be built : it will be printed
0	bring him to me !
0	no , the persons have moved away
0	it is understood , of course , that the rue neuve-sainte-genevieve is an old street , and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years
0	he plunged into the silent streets
0	the priest , erect on his feet , irritated , threatening , imperious ; quasimodo , prostrate , humble , suppliant
0	there , you deaf villain , i ’ m your debtor
0	and being convinced himself , he was persuasive
0	it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street
0	and then , she had so often been told that she was homely ; jean valjean alone said gently : no indeed !
0	his costume could be plainly discerned , and his face resting on both his hands
0	he was severe in his enjoyments
0	he laid the pile of five-franc pieces on the old serving-woman 's nightstand , and returned to his chamber without saying a word
0	but they understood each other perfectly
0	gavroche was working on the larger one
0	then with her two hands , she finished breaking and removing the rusted stumps of the bars
0	is not the draught of fishes sufficiently fine and miraculous ?
0	yes , assuredly , sire , replied gossip jacques
0	thou art not an ingrate !
0	he had written to him , without knowing him , the letter with which the reader is acquainted
0	that night , on thinking the matter over , he regretted not having questioned the man , in order to force him to raise his head a second time
0	it is petty , ugly , infamous
0	why did you not kill the man ?
0	at the hôtel-de-ville , i tell you !
0	i see plainly that you do not love me !
0	as he opened his mouth , doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired , the man rested both hands on his staff , directed his gaze at the old man and the two women , and without waiting for the bishop to speak , he said , in a loud voice : -see here
0	marius ' manners were no longer in the least natural
0	so you are not a grave-digger , then ?
0	it did not allow the passage of the body , but it did allow the passage of the eyes ; that is to say , of the mind
0	was to cut off from the provostship in the following year ?
0	we shall see further on that this man had , in fact , hired a chamber in that isolated quarter
0	the sanctuary of virtue can not cohabit longer with crime without abdicating
0	_le mur murant paris rend paris murmurant_
0	at that moment , a scene which was passing at the pillory caught her wild eye
0	they were no longer eyes ; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men , which seem unconscious of reality , and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes
0	before he shut his eyes , jean valjean said : i must remain here henceforth
0	the passage in which he had burrowed -- no other word can better express the situation -- was walled in behind him
0	a local tradition , which evidently exaggerates matters , says that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road of ohain
0	he was a priest , a sage , and a man
0	a lie wedded number ; the right divine was masked under a charter ; fictions became constitutional ; prejudices , superstitions and mental reservations , with article number in the heart , were varnished over with liberalism
0	there was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise
0	you are an ingrate !
0	they were chattering in all quarters
0	and moreover , when both are sincere and good , no men so penetrate each other , and so amalgamate with each other , as an old priest and an old soldier
0	tell it to me
0	the halls are nothing but rooms , and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them
0	it seems that the celestins are full of pistols
0	m leblanc seemed to be asking himself : is this man an idiot ?
0	there did not , as yet , exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations , like the german tugendbund and italian carbonarism ; but here and there there were dark underminings , which were in process of throwing off shoots
0	her face was still flooded with tears , but her eyes began to fill , like the sky at daybreak , with strange beams of joy
0	those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker , thought marius
0	montparnasse , though not naturally inclined to astonishment , could not restrain an exclamation
0	and you , jolllly , where do you stand in your entanglement with mamselle -- you know whom i mean ?
0	i have heard that name
0	if he had worn a decoration , marius would have said : he is an ex-officer
0	another said : i do not ask for six months , i do not ask for even two
0	in the meantime , the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat , without any one having noticed his movements
0	he went a little to chapel , not at all to the chase , never to the opera
0	marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass , emerged from the garden , and said : i will go
0	in french , he preferred corneille to racine , and agrippa d'aubigne to corneille
0	the eight of clubs , for instance , represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves , a sort of fantastic personification of the forest
0	had they actually existed ?
0	bulow had not moved , in fact
0	one day , mother plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room
0	in fact , what a pretty little goat !
0	so he did not dare to trust to it too implicitly
0	this man was brujon , the long-haired man of the rue du petit-banquier
0	the mother was a good simple woman , unfortunately , and she taught paquette nothing but a bit of embroidery and toy-making which did not prevent the little one from growing very large and remaining very poor
0	when you have ascended the rue saint-jacques , left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance , you reach the rue de la sante , then the glaciere , and , a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins , you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris , where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down
0	the right , too grandly proclaimed , is shaken
0	nor a package of duds in your hand , as you had this morning here !
0	what have i done to him ?
0	i shall have extinguished my fire , wrecked my chair , torn my shirt , and broken my pane all for nothing
0	the effect can be imagined !
0	a cafe in the rue saint-hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the seven billiards , rue des mathurins-saint-jacques , served as rallying points for the students
0	this hosier was an equal , who had just held his own before monsieur the cardinal
0	but if one remained near him for a few hours , and beheld him in the least degree pensive , the fine man became gradually transfigured , and took on some imposing quality , i know not what ; his broad and serious brow , rendered august by his white locks , became august also by virtue of meditation ; majesty radiated from his goodness , though his goodness ceased not to be radiant ; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings , without ceasing to smile
0	fantine heard the gossips say , as they looked at her child : who takes those children seriously !
0	a big voice , a good fellow
0	she had just dazzled herself
0	we will go and have a drink together presently
0	he peered through the pane as he had done at the public house
0	but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion
0	the tavern-keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller ; he seemed to be scenting out the man , as he would have scented out a bag of money
0	at intervals , as he combated his lassitude , he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind
0	it is certain that gringoire was enduring cruel perplexity
0	legend says they were not
0	but to-day , you see , i cried because it hurt me
0	it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne , and the mitre in the name of the attar ; it is to ill-treat the thing which one is dragging , it is to kick over the traces ; it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics ; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry ; it is to insult through excess of respect ; it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish , that the king is not sufficiently royal , and that the night has too much light ; it is to be discontented with alabaster , with snow , with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness ; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy ; it is to be so strongly for , as to be against
0	it bears the date of july number , number
0	upon the furnace were accumulated in disorder , all sorts of vases , earthenware bottles , glass retorts , and mattresses of charcoal
0	a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers
0	thisbe stops her nose in the presence of pyramus and says : phew !
0	cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen
0	he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform : the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he sought with all possible discretion
0	these words touched m gillenormand ; uttered a little sooner , they would have rendered him tender , but they came too late
0	do come to my assistance : is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star ?
0	the cart was conquered , the drunken man was taken prisoner
0	in a moment they constituted a word , which the goat seemed to have been trained to write , so little hesitation did it show in forming it , and bérangère suddenly exclaimed , clasping her hands in admiration , --
0	does he think i can make it ?
0	he was no further advanced than at the beginning
0	one day , he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs : the father must give them some education
0	here , replied a black gown whom she had not before noticed
0	few prowlers were so dreaded as montparnasse
0	the fact is , that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet
0	what matters it , after all ?
0	m gillenormand , clutched by the throat by his own phrase , could not proceed
0	la vesle , replied mahiette , with a melancholy smile , is the river
0	madame thenardier was vicious with cosette
0	he had discovered , by dint of industry , or , at least , by dint of induction , he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer
0	she made haste to dress herself
0	does any body want me here ?
0	they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that
0	there was at toulon a school for the convicts , kept by the ignorantin friars , where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them
0	it was rapid but majestic
0	then , addressing the soldiers : -say , you fellows , did you see how i spit in his face ?
0	on this paper there was an address : m barge , collector of rents , rue du roi-de-sicile , no
0	he did not go out until six o'clock in the evening , and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour
0	let us set out at once ! -- during that time , she said to herself , my daughter will make her escape
0	this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will ; it is a box
0	one day when blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the rue guerin-boisseau , he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up , which displayed her legs
0	moreover , -- and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur , -- she had grown used , without being herself aware of it , to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny
0	i have knocked at all doors
0	at the present moment i feel a magnificent vocation for that profession
0	what a good night to leg it !
0	a brave little bird , probably a lover , was carolling in a distractedmanner in a large tree
0	the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels , the fellies , the hub , the axle , and the shaft , a layer of mud , a hideous yellowish daubing hue , tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals
0	the band of thieves applauded clopin ’ s words , and arranged themselves in a circle round the gibbet , with a laugh so pitiless that gringoire perceived that he amused them too much not to have everything to fear from them
0	do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again
0	and whether , the fault once committed and confessed , the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned
0	should he place upon the peaceful fender of the gillenormand drawing-room those feet of his , which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law ?
0	then , as is the nature of these clouds , calm returned to her , and hope and a sort of unconscious smile , which yet indicated trustin god
0	his mother is dead
0	he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel
0	the errand-boy next door has a little pointed beard , i have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm ; to-day i saw him pass , and he had a gun on his arm
0	in order to provide more arms , one man took the gun , the other the bayonet
0	the old woman was in the chamber , putting things in order
0	our readers have not forgotten the mysterious cell which the archdeacon had reserved for himself in that tower
0	i was unjustly arrested ; i am innocent of this civil tempest
0	i know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of trousers
0	her cough did not leave her , and she had sweats on her back
0	in this horror , let us state , there was some pity , and even a certain surprise
0	there existed some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun ; and , to all appearances , scruples had for a long time already controlled this man
0	marius held his peace ; she remained silent for a moment , then exclaimed : -but if i choose , nevertheless , i could force you to look glad !
0	you understand me , azelma
0	mixed joy , said the bishop
0	what is this place ?
0	she will only be a baroness , which is a come down for her ; she was born a marquise
0	there he no longer moved
0	i know it , replied the hosier , gravely
0	it seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul
0	resources are exhausted , needs crop up
0	the well-being of man , that was what they wanted to extract from society
0	what is situated on the side of winter belongs to vaud , on the side of the wind to gex
0	marius continued with increased enthusiasm , and almost without pausing for breath : -let us be just , my friends !
0	the senator above mentioned was a clever man , who had made his own way , heedless of those things which present obstacles , and which are called conscience , sworn faith , justice , duty : he had marched straight to his goal , without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest
0	it was the man with the axe , who was growing merry
0	the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit-picpus , a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud , whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise , and , consequently , worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall
0	wellington perceived it , and thought of his cavalry
0	none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man
0	he had said , i see yonder a cloud , which seems to me to be troops
0	i have no one
0	he carried his head thrown backwards ; his shirt , widely opened and turned back , displayed his bull neck , white and bare
0	poor creature , he said in a low tone , and speaking to himself , he is hungry
0	then , although it was still broad daylight , -- it was summer , -- he lighted them
0	why had not javert arrested jean valjean ?
0	i ask nothing better , dom claude ; but what if i entangle myself in some villanous affair ?
0	m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading , with the aid of his glasses , two books of which he was passionately fond and in which , a serious thing at his age , he was interested
0	at the same time , one of them took a handful of straw and set off to light it at the wick of the good virgin
0	the whole thing was compact , overwhelming , and misshapen
0	moreover , as she knew nothing , she could say nothing , and then , she would not have said anything in any case
0	on recovering from his first stupefaction , he bestirred himself to shout , to the four personages on the stage , go on !
0	i do not ask for your secrets , you need not tell them to me , but i may be of use , nevertheless
0	they assembled in paris in two localities , near the fish-market , in a wine-shop called corinthe , of which more will be heard later on , and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue saint-michel called the cafe musain , now torn down ; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman , the second to the students
0	the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside , being concealed , as we have stated , beneath the elephant 's belly , and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it
0	he walked very near the street-posts , and guided himself along the walls of the houses
0	the sun had succeeded to the chandelier , and made its way gayly into the drawing-room
0	it -- that barricade , chance , hazard , disorder , terror , misunderstanding , the unknown -- had facing it the constituent assembly , the sovereignty of the people , universal suffrage , the nation , the republic ; and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to the marseillaise
0	and all the reflections which that strange spectacle would awaken in us to-day ; that horrible cell , a sort of intermediary link between a house and the tomb , the cemetery and the city ; that living being cut off from the human community , and thenceforth reckoned among the dead ; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the darkness ; that remnant of life flickering in the grave ; that breath , that voice , that eternal prayer in a box of stone ; that face forever turned towards the other world ; that eye already illuminated with another sun ; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb ; that soul a prisoner in that body ; that body a prisoner in that dungeon cell , and beneath that double envelope of flesh and granite , the murmur of that soul in pain ; -- nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd
0	the reader has divined , no doubt , that thenardier 's pursuer was no other than javert
0	but , sad to say , from time to time , the exceptional becomes necessary
0	marius was now a thoroughly roused man
0	she sewed seventeen hours a day ; but a contractor for the work of prisons , who made the prisoners work at a discount , suddenly made prices fall , which reduced the daily earnings of working-women to nine sous
0	tis more than a year since the tail of a stone cart dashed against my window and broke in the grating
0	a few paces distant , an enormous pillar , then another , then another ; seven pillars in all , down the length of the hall , sustaining the spring of the arches of the double vault , in the centre of its width
0	the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees , cosette was meditating ; an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little , that invincible sadness evoked by the evening , and which arises , perhaps , who knows , from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour
0	i am here to do anything you wish
0	this is what i imagine , messire
0	this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable ; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion
0	cosette sufficed for his happiness ; the idea that he , perhaps , did not suffice for cosette 's happiness , that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness , did not even present itself to his mind
0	and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread
0	the child , whose thoughts were still on the thenardier , shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible
0	the door opened instantly , and allowed the new-corners to see an old woman and an old lamp , both of which trembled
0	yes , monsieur le maire
0	a pause ensued , as though both sides were waiting
0	and she went on : this is what i call being good : being nice and coming and living here , -- there are birds here as there are in the rue plumet , -- living with us , quitting that hole of a rue de l'homme arme , not giving us riddles to guess , being like all the rest of the world , dining with us , breakfasting with us , being my father
0	but every evil thought is inexorable , and insists on becoming a deed ; but where i believed myself to be all powerful , fate was more powerful than i alas !
0	marius , vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place , asked this passer-by : -- what is the name of this spot ?
0	she brought a silver fork and spoon , which she placed on the table
0	hence the advent , apparently tardy , of the tacituses and the juvenals ; it is in the hour for evidence , that the demonstrator makes his appearance
0	from a purely literary point of view , few studies would prove more curious and fruitful than the study of slang
0	so it was a woman ?
0	replied jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius
0	laigle de meaux , as the reader knows , lived more with joly than elsewhere
0	but not for so long
0	since i tell you so
0	he cried to cosette : -go away with you !
0	so it 's you , you little wretch !
0	he had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near the door , and , after several moments of a silence which appeared to be a continuation of a preceding meditation , he said to him in a rather patronizing way , good day , master jacques
0	a fright which can be comprehended , a wrath which can be pardoned
0	mame bacheux says , that last week there was a revolution at -- at -- at -- where 's the calf ! -- at pontoise
0	the cellars of an edifice formed another edifice , into which one descended instead of ascending , and which extended its subterranean grounds under the external piles of the monument , like those forests and mountains which are reversed in the mirror-like waters of a lake , beneath the forests and mountains of the banks
0	the brawl of passions and ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress
0	why do you wear old hats like this !
0	he draws his feet out of the sand , he tries to retrace his steps , he turns back , he sinks in more deeply than before
0	not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever
0	this time it was sinister
0	the crowd became silent , and , in the midst of this silence full of anxiety and solemnity , the two leaves of the grand door swung back , as of themselves , on their hinges , which gave a creak like the sound of a fife
0	exclaimed the entire crowd , in one voice
0	two lackeys of the official torturer bathed the bleeding shoulders of the patient , anointed them with some unguent which immediately closed all the wounds , and threw upon his back a sort of yellow vestment , in cut like a chasuble
0	at the same time , thenardier perceived in the direction of the bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise
0	she will find my letter
0	that , in the first place , it is very rare for any one to die of hunger , literally ; and next , that , fortunately or unfortunately , man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much , both morally and physically , without dying ; that it is therefore necessary to have patience ; that that would even have been better for those poor little children ; that it had been an act of madness for him , a miserable , unfortunate wretch , to take society at large violently by the collar , and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft ; that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters ; in short , that he was in the wrong
0	here is a place , here is a night beyond which one sees nothing
0	is there an infinite beyond us ?
0	he bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret
0	the pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes , and a red flag , fastened to this pole , floated over the barricade
0	he believed to the extent of his powers
0	these advanced opinions had a double foundation
0	at dessert , m gillenormand , rising to his feet , with a glass of champagne in his hand -- only half full so that the palsy of his eighty years might not cause an overflow , -- proposed the health of the married pair
0	twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjolras , and silently made ready their guns
0	she had always been predestined to gentleness ; but faith , charity , hope , those three virtues which mildly warm the soul , had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
0	at that moment , a distinct cry arose in the buzzing throng which surrounded him , let ’ s take him to the king !
0	she owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led
0	superposed , the one upon the other ?
0	the man is well pinioned
0	fortunately , the doctor had been warned , and he now made his appearance
0	enjolras expressed its divine right , and combeferre its natural right
0	she gazed about her on all sides
0	towards the middle of the day , after having , from time to time , for the sake of resting herself , travelled , for three or four sous a league , in what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris , the little suburban coach service , fantine found herself at montfermeil , in the alley boulanger
0	once outside of the house , he made for the rue du petit-banquier
0	the children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle
0	sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart
0	in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest , he said : look at the people of embrun !
0	she thought herself victorious , and continued , --
0	have no fear of me
0	he wrote slowly the few following lines : cosette , i bless thee
0	he was filled with regret and remorse , and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb
0	he came , examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken
0	i hope that he will not consent to it
0	you have dressed up
0	now , these parents groan , these old folks implore us , these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons ; they desire our return , and offer to kill calves for usbeing virtuous , we obey them
0	shrieked the hair-dresser , who from white had turned blue , that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it
0	from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow , and he had followed , all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death
0	night was falling ; the square was dark ; the wine-shop , full of candles , flamed afar like a forge in the gloom ; the noise of glasses and feasting , of oaths and quarrels , which escaped through the broken panes , was audible
0	he put all these questions to himself without replying to them
0	he said to me : no , give me your address , my daughter has some purchases to make , i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do
0	come along and drink , he cried , since it is i who pays the bill
0	his daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace , the elder engaged in dressing the younger 's wounded hand
0	this liberty goes very far
0	the man turned round
0	said the archdeacon , a crucible for alchemy
0	invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street ; snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night
0	a revolt was , in its eyes , no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths , and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril
0	a simple matter , nevertheless --
0	he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man , who was , in his eyes , both equivocal and imposing
0	the moment has arrived , it seems to me ; let us discuss the question
0	you are an inn-keeper , are you not ?
0	she shall be brought hither
0	i was house-surgeon in that hospital
0	monseigneur is what they call him
0	so he resembles me !
0	they are becoming extinguished
0	each one felt herself , in some sort , wounded in her beauty
0	fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich , while he , a lawyer , was being ruined
0	he made up his mind to save m madeleine
0	at the age of twenty , by special dispensation of the holy see , he was a priest , and served as the youngest of the chaplains of notre-dame the altar which is called , because of the late mass which is said there , _altare pigrorum_
0	go to filspierre , between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil , and you will find work
0	and besides , the light might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochere , and all the bobbies need to do is to see it
0	he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger
0	people who have ascended the towers of notre-dame know that there is a swell of the stone immediately beneath the balustrade
0	people would drive away the graces as being too low in the neck
0	the whole of progress tends in the direction of solution
0	with cosette 's garter , homer would construct the iliad
0	i assure you that we were all weeping also
0	you can get as much as you want
0	in this open-air society , it is the rag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes
0	gieffroy mabonne , gendarme bearing the crossbow
0	all is over then
0	my drawing-room , which contains no furniture , and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing , is fifteen feet in height , eighteen square , with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded , and with beams , as in yours
0	la esmeralda was sleeping at the moment when the outcasts assailed the church
0	a whole political school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this
0	as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun , we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
0	on another occasion , alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry , he wrote in connection with a political criminal , who is one of the most generous figures of our day : his pardon is granted ; it only remains for me to obtain it
0	how was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the cannon-balls ?
0	said he , there 's the wick giving out
0	enjolras , pale , with bare neck and dishevelled hair , and his woman 's face , had about him at that moment something of the antique themis
0	cosette had meant to scratch , and she lacerated
0	the wretched man tries to sit down , to lie down , to climb ; every movement that he makes buries him deeper ; he straightens himself up , he sinks ; he feels that he is being swallowed up ; he shrieks , implores , cries to the clouds , wrings his hands , grows desperate
0	in the incomprehensible plan of these streets , one distinguished likewise , on looking attentively , two clusters of great streets , like magnified sheaves of grain , one in the university , the other in the town , which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates
0	at moments , in that dizzy depth , a gleam of light appeared , and undulated vaguely , water possessing the power of taking light , no one knows whence , and converting it into a snake
0	to cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries , to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire , to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army , to make its legions fly forth over all the earth , as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer , to dominate , to strike with lightning , to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory , to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of titans , to conquer the world twice , by conquest and by dazzling , that is sublime ; and what greater thing is there ?
0	i have lost it , replied gringoire
0	he replaced the pocketbook in marius ' pocket
0	that volley of grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick building on the right of the road at a few minutes ' distance before you enter genappe
0	how i do lie !
0	he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou
0	the wise people said to the foolish : don ’ t go there !
0	i have that fatality hanging over me that , not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration , that consideration humiliates me , and crushes me inwardly , and , in order that i may respect myself , it is necessary that i should be despised
0	one can consent to it for the first hour ; one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron , one places on one 's head the crown of hot iron , one accepts the globe of red hot iron , one takes the sceptre of red hot iron , but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned , and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering ?
0	cosette , who only understood in a very confused manner , redoubled her caresses , as though she desired to pay marius ' debt
0	it was not easy to see these two men , except from the quay opposite , and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance , the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling , tattered , and equivocal being , who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse , and the other like a classic and official personage , wearing the frock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin
0	great things had been accomplished , with it alongside
0	the hydra at the beginning , the angel at the end
0	marius lowered his head in his turn ; that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel , and he felt it vanishing within him
0	i have read a great deal of plato , but nothing of it remains by me ; better than malebranche and then lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me , i obeyed thee , thou didst submit to me ; oh gilded garret !
0	terror chilled the very marrow of her bones ; she stood there bewildered and stupefied
0	he has an astonished air , he pretends to be stupid ; it is far better
0	what if you should meet them !
0	in number , in a number of streets , in the rue de l'etoile , the rue saint-louis , the rue du temple , the rue vielle-dutemple , the rue notre-dame de nazareth , the rue folie-mericourt , the quai aux fleurs , the rue du petit-muse , the rue du normandie , the rue pont-aux-biches , the rue des marais , the faubourg saint-martin , the rue notre dame des-victoires , the faubourg montmartre , the rue grange-bateliere , in the champs-elysees , the rue jacob , the rue de tournon , the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw
0	condemn the victim and to spare the assassin !
0	noonday alone had arrived on time
0	the archdeacon , who was very much embarrassed by such a visit in such a place , trembled in his arm-chair
0	on the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people
0	j'ai fort lu platon , mais rien ne m'en reste ; mieux que malebranche et que lamennais , tu me demontrais la bonte celeste avec une fleur que tu me donnais
0	it is not permitted to fall asleep , either in the shadow of a machineel tree , nor in the shadow of an army
0	on the numberth of june , number , the rains had still farther increased this acclivity , the mud complicated the problem of the ascent , and the men not only slipped back , but stuck fast in the mire
0	the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals
0	good old folks , let us smash with our crutches that louvre where the monarchy displayed itself in furbelows
0	certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape , ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined
0	fine gentry are our people of the university , not to have caused our privileges to be respected on such a day as this !
0	i leave you , madame , they are waiting for you
0	he sought to collect his faculties , but could not
0	the sainte-marthe chamber , said he
0	then she struck him with the fury of a child
0	they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast , under his shirt , which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon
0	he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering , and he accepted , as the process of civilization , social damnation
0	no , it was not you who came to montfermeil , to my inn , eight years ago , on christmas eve , number !
0	he made no reply
0	one would have said that this hand was riveted to her arm
0	the father exclaimed : -go in , nevertheless
0	the installation over , the town waited to see its bishop at work
0	fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts
0	if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo , this was the means employed by charles the fifth , desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication
0	at recreation hours , jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance , and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest
0	no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus ; he was some unknown blouse-wearer , a stranger , a man forgotten , a passing hero , that great anonymous , always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who , at a given moment , utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word , and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute , in a lightning flash , the people and god
0	sometimes even several of them at a time
0	the royalty of july reared up , in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets
0	the ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household
0	boulatruelle , accustomed to taking crooked courses , was on this occasion guilty of the fault of going straight
0	i , the person who is speaking to you , was present
0	he told him the best truths , which are also the most simple
0	the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth , and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes
0	it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak
0	that which is on high at the summit , at the crest , at the zenith , that which sends down so much light on the earth , sees but little , sees badly , sees not at all ?
0	is it not the sower ?
0	in this manner she reached the spring
0	she began to laugh
0	can one be more white and blonde ?
0	there was no longer anything in the street ; there was nothing in the garden
0	this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer ; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it
0	nevertheless , whatever may be the contrast , all these toilers , from the highest to the most nocturnal , from the wisest to the most foolish , possess one likeness , and this is it : disinterestedness
0	her candle had burned all night , and was almost entirely consumed
0	the matter is simple
0	you must go there after you are married
0	was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres , sixteen sous , eight farthings , which the future king charles vii
0	then his chest sank in , his head wavered , as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him
0	in the tenth year his turn came round again ; he again profited by it ; he succeeded no better
0	he did not stir
0	he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire
0	was the fire wholly extinct there ?
0	this man has insinuated himself into your confidence , and almost into your family under a false name
0	he said to himself : there may still be a glimpse of life there , perchance ; i will risk my own existence for that miserable spark !
0	the poor children , including gavroche , were famished
0	it was not an affirmation that he made , but a question which he put to himself : is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert ?
0	the generous quarrel began afresh
0	the little fellows nudged each other , the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time , and then , it was raining very hard
0	she set about arranging the table ; her husband paced the room
0	some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach , and that he had already , on the previous day , made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village , for he had not been seen in the village itself
0	the wretched woman began to laugh in her wild way
0	one must resign one 's self
0	his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes
0	he was even the author of the monumental window
0	he could not refrain from clapping his hands
0	from the question of the scaffold to the question of war , their works embraced everything
0	his hands , which rested on his knees , began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers
0	an intercepted letter read : the day is not far distant when , within four hours by the clock , eighty thousand patriots will be under arms
0	jean valjean , armed with his bar of iron , walked slowly up to fantine 's couch
0	these voices had this strange characteristic , that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted
0	his face , an inexhaustible repertory of masks , produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale
0	could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid ?
0	pontmercy fought at spire , at worms , at neustadt , at turkheim , at alzey , at mayence , where he was one of the two hundred who formed houchard 's rearguard
0	it is not hard to meet him
0	enjolras said : joly is ill , grantaire is drunk
0	he looked at it , and recognized a wooden shoe , a frightful shoe of the coarsest description , half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud
0	he thought to himself
0	everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open
0	and so have i , said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror , i have something to say to the very reverend mother
0	as she spoke thus , with her other arm extended through the window , she showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe
0	she never made a mistake about anything , and she saw things justly
0	the english barricaded themselves there ; the french made their way in , but could not stand their ground
0	i do not understand you , said gervaise
0	and one day i saw a bishop there
0	they let me out !
0	but in a few days fantine disarmed them
0	it was not long in presenting itself
0	you owe me reparation
0	the name of a woman should be agreeable , sweet , fanciful ; it should end in long vowels , and resemble words of benediction
0	this jean valjean instantly comprehended
0	on the evening before , in the darkness , the barricade had been approached silently , as by a boa
0	said he , adjusting himself as well as possible , i must resign myself
0	ever since number , petty partial revolts had been going on here and there , which were quickly suppressed , but ever bursting forth afresh , the sign of a vast underlying conflagration
0	progress infallibly awakes , and , in short , we may say that it marches on , even when it is asleep , for it has increased in size
0	had i been able to tear out that thread , to break it , to undo the knot or to cut it , to go far away , i should have been safe
0	this communicates with the abyss
0	repeated marius in a rage
0	this had its disadvantages
0	she had not been there on the preceding evening , and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said : it appears that there is a row
0	the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity
0	the indefinite , which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite , escapes them
0	conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
0	all of a sudden , he would burst out laughing
0	the first auditor whom messire miles d ’ isliers , doctor in decretals , saw arrive every monday morning , all breathless , at the opening of the gates of the school of the chef-saint-denis , was claude frollo
0	must men be cold and feel uncomfortable ?
0	it is art which has changed its skin
0	in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard , he saw the four lines which follow : -my dearest , alas !
0	of course , continued the small imp on the capital , what are they laughing at ?
0	mr marius , are you there ?
0	two surtouts are a good thing , murmured fauchelevent , who really was a little hard of hearing
0	exclaimed the archdeacon , at the moment when the juggler , perspiring heavily , passed in front of him with his pyramid of chair and his cat , what is master pierre gringoire doing here ?
0	does your arm hurt you ?
0	inquiry was made at that convent ; the very best information and the most respectable references abounded ; the good nuns , not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity , and not attaching any importance to the matter , had never understood exactly of which of the two fauchelevents cosette was the daughter
0	i do not want your angel , i want my child !
0	as he plunged into the side aisles , he perceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars
0	they sang their little ca ira : -- ah !
0	and when a village curate came to d -- -- , the bishop still found means to entertain him , thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire , and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine
0	as he spoke , he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron , and he continued : -hold , i know now
0	said the poor girl , and i thought my name pretty because of its singularity !
0	we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present
0	courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf
0	a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house
0	fantine was beautiful , and remained pure as long as she couldshe was a lovely blonde , with fine teeth
0	this was lugubrious in the darkness , and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other
0	the abbe de la trappe replies to horace
0	woman , resumed tholomyes ; distrust her
0	let us tell the truth , we who are initiated , and who have raised the veil of isis : there is no such thing as either good or evil ; there is vegetation
0	at every blow he traced around him a great circle of severed limbs
0	these flowers were his occupation
0	you see , my benefactor , no bread , no fire
0	the captain was the first to break the silence
0	it was a new lodger who has come into the house , said the old woman
0	when she recovered her senses , she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain , bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared ; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open ; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her ,
0	the corridor was long , the staircase steep , jondrette was talkative , m leblanc had , no doubt , not yet regained his carriage ; if , on turning round in the corridor , or on the staircase , he were to catch sight of him , marius , in that house , he would , evidently , take the alarm , and find means to escape from him again , and this time it would be final
0	this solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes : monstrous opulence , monstrous wretchedness
0	when the nettle is young , the leaf makes an excellent vegetable ; when it is older , it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax
0	its quay , broken or interrupted in many places , ran along the seine , from the tour de billy to the tour du bois ; that is to say , from the place where the granary stands to-day , to the present site of the tuileries
0	the priest saw it , and tested with the tip of his finger the point of a poniard which he wore concealed in his breast
0	sent two hundred phials of it to the pope
0	the man , without making any reply , fumbled in his pocket , and thenardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more
0	the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum-beats , clamors , platoon firing , and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon
0	he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it , with the rigid rapidity of a projectile ; the alley of l'homme arme became silent and solitary once more ; in a twinkling , that strange child , who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream , had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses , and was lost there , like smoke in the dark ; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished , had there not taken place , a few minutes after his disappearance , a startling shiver of glass , and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois
0	by the way , my dear captain , you just mentioned the rue coupe-gueule that is a very bad form of speech ; people are no longer so barbarous
0	he put his pocketbook back in his pocket , then he called gavroche
0	two or three times
0	cut-throat , yes ; cutpurse , no
0	he had remained , therefore , for several minutes , leaning in silence against the carved jamb of the chimney , and thinking or not thinking , when fleur-de-lys suddenly turned and addressed him
0	these men do not recognize me !
0	an iron neck-collar was hanging in one of these cells
0	you make me boil , gringoire
0	it fills the first-comer with the force of events ; it converts everything into projectiles
0	he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account
0	he is napoleon 's stay and danton 's resourceis it a question of country , he enlists ; is it a question of liberty , he tears up the pavements
0	they began to wander aimlessly through the streets
0	my dear fellow , then in order to please her , you must be elegant , and produce effects with your knees
0	is this your little girl ?
0	what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation ?
0	a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there , swelling hearts and enlarging souls
0	he made no reply
0	the thenardier inquired of the traveller
0	independently of the original and individual contribution of each writer , there are collective contingents
0	a bourgeois had the air of a flower , a marquis had the air of a precious stone
0	whispered courfeyrac to jean prouvaire
0	in this unknown , every step that he risked might be his last
0	in truth , said gringoire to himself , she is a salamander , she is a nymph , she is a goddess , she is a bacchante of the menelean mount !
0	the song died away
0	at the shock of the beam , the half metallic door sounded like an immense drum ; it was not burst in , but the whole cathedral trembled , and the deepest cavities of the edifice were heard to echo
0	we shall not try to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose , that horseshoe mouth ; that little left eye obstructed with a red , bushy , bristling eyebrow , while the right eye disappeared entirely beneath an enormous wart ; of those teeth in disarray , broken here and there , like the embattled parapet of a fortress ; of that callous lip , upon which one of these teeth encroached , like the tusk of an elephant ; of that forked chin ; and above all , of the expression spread over the whole ; of that mixture of malice , amazement , and sadness
0	having never had any money , i never acquired the habit of it , and the result is that i have never lacked it ; but , if i had been rich , there would have been no more poor people !
0	she comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you
0	and he held out the envelope containing the four letters
0	he had a pointed thing , made of gold , on his head ; it glittered in the bright light of midday
0	enjolras brought the square coffer , and courfeyrac opened it
0	to mingle with one 's life a certain presence of the sepulchre , -- this is the law of the sage ; and it is the law of the ascetic
0	all these things , realities full of spectres , phantasmagories full of realities , had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable
0	the windows had short curtains , a sign that there was a woman about
0	the man was sitting there , and letting cosette get somewhat rested
0	nevertheless , in spite of all this , and because of all this , his passion augmented and grew to madness
0	monsieur pontmercy , you pardon me !
0	he had eaten nothing all day ; it is probable that he was feverish
0	in the meantime aunt gillenormand , a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties , had finally hunted up marius ' abode
0	the sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side , the priests of the officiality on the other
0	his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him
0	it is because it was six hundred years in building
0	it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors : people avoided him when he went out ; he perceived the fact
0	i have been robbed , said the officer ; i am sorry for that
0	and turning to marius : -my brother is here
0	this was his axiom : there is but one certainty , my full glass
0	got rid of is the word
0	was he seized at the age of forty-six with a supreme madness ?
0	you are finely taken aback , and really , you are excessively ignorant
0	marius entered , his head well up , his mouth smiling , an indescribable light on his countenance , his brow expanded , his eyes triumphant
0	that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card , and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings , since it was in fauchelevent 's pocket
0	it seemed , from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth , -- incoherent , impetuous , pell-mell , tumbling over each other , -- as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once
0	when they were exhausted , when these formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball , each grasped in his hands two of the bottles which enjolras had reserved , and of which we have spoken , and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs
0	they , on their side , did not appear even to see him
0	the king looked him full in the face
0	hesitations , scruples , particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand
0	at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted ; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope , which traversed the street from side to side , and was adjusted in a groove of the post
0	but can not you get out by the way in which you entered ?
0	the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second
0	ou vont les belles filles , lon la
0	he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty , if being at liberty is to be hunted , to turn the head every instant , to quake at the slightest noise , to be afraid of everything , -- of a smoking roof , of a passing man , of a barking dog , of a galloping horse , of a striking clock , of the day because one can see , of the night because one can not see , of the highway , of the path , of a bush , of sleep
0	jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece , where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint
0	he was directing his course towards the belt sewer ; he was on the right path
0	we were attached to the same chain for five years
0	no , phoebus , no ; i will be thy mistress , thy amusement , thy pleasure , when thou wilt ; a girl who shall belong to thee
0	the insurgents did not reply to this musketry , in order to spare their ammunition the fusillade broke againstthe barricade ; but the street , which it filled , was terrible
0	m madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures
0	it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth , to confide themselves to that black gloom , and to trust to providence for the outcome
0	it is certain that the provincial was on the point of taking offence , for the honor of her pillory
0	he took a circuit , turned into the passage des patriarches , which was closed on account of the hour , strode along the rue de l'epee-de-bois and the rue de l'arbalete , and plunged into the rue des postes
0	but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again
0	and you will come out at fifty !
0	they were alone in the garden
0	monsieur fabantou , he said , these five francs are all that i have about me , but i shall now take my daughter home , and i will return this evening , -- it is this evening that you must pay , is it not ?
0	the lawyer left him
0	a fine pleasure to produce , when you walk , the same noise as the quay of old iron , in an earthquake !
0	all four were madly pretty
0	it seems to me at times that you are a dream
0	they passed the bakeshop , but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch
0	it was joy , splendor , riches , happiness , which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery
0	in the second place , are you the discharged convict , jean valjean -- yes or no ?
0	the revolution of july had been a fine popular gale , abruptly followed by blue sky
0	on emerging upon the place , he laughed yet more heartily
0	paris is the centre of two sheets , a sheet of water and a sheet of air
0	the central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages , whose birds , reared by himself , sang for him alone
0	when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom
0	then turning to the elder : -there now !
0	-- and the house assumes the air of a tomb
0	it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts , you shall give her your arm , you know , as you used to , in the luxembourg
0	they had stopped crying
0	who will plant the flag on the barricade again ?
0	a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle
0	at the same time , over his childish countenance which was , at once so impudent and so serious , so giddy and so profound , so gay and so heart-breaking , passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify : ah bah !
0	the soldiers fly from him , shouting , long live marshal ney !
0	the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms
0	who thus soils the triumph ?
0	he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette , where they could both hide themselves
0	she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier : -may i , madame ?
0	no idiom is more metaphorical than slang : devisser le coco ( to unscrew the nut ) , to twist the neck ; tortiller ( to wriggle ) , to eat ; etre gerbe , to be tried ; a rat , a bread thief ; il lansquine , it rains , a striking , ancient figure which partly bears its date about it , which assimilates long oblique lines of rain , with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers , and which compresses into a single word the popular expression : it rains halberds
0	and of the dean , m delvincourt : what a monument !
0	but how was it to be done ?
0	the man resumed tranquilly , put me in the stable
0	the priest ’ s eye was staring , wild , flaming , and remained riveted on the horrible little group of the spider and the fly
0	their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness
0	when one heard her speak , one said , that is a gendarme ; when one saw her drink , one said , that is a carter ; when one saw her handle cosette , one said , that is the hangman
0	but there came a moment when the child trembled ; madame thenardier raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove , then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern
0	this carriage which has become colossal through its freight , has an air of conquest
0	to-day is ash-wednesday ; but not for the birds
0	with the abrupt leap of that spider which we have seen fling itself upon a fly at the trembling of its web , she rushed to her air-hole , which opened as the reader knows , on the place de grève
0	something enormous remained long empty through napoleon 's disappearance
0	jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it
0	the conventionary opened his eyes again
0	grumbled phoebus , here ’ s a villanous ; ruffled bird which i fancy i have seen somewhere
0	hideousness of aspect , deformity of instinct , troubled him not , and did not arouse his indignation
0	the parisians stared indifferently at this useless thing
0	the thinker of to-day has a great duty -- to auscultate civilization
0	my lodger sends me into bankruptcy
0	shall you come again , doctor ?
0	asked brujon , the rue p ?
0	let 's get well into a corner , said brujon
0	the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance
0	all at once , a man on horseback , clad in black , made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag , others say , with a pike surmounted with a red liberty-cap
0	from the cess-pool , it re-constitutes the city ; from mud , it reconstructs manners ; from the potsherd it infers the amphora or the jug
0	cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child ; she was a little more than fourteen , and she was at the ungrateful age ; we have already said , that with the exception of her eyes , she was homely rather than pretty ; she had no ungraceful feature , but she was awkward , thin , timid and bold at once , a grown-up little girl , in short
0	it re-discovers in what remains that which has been , good , evil , the true , the blood-stain of the palace , the ink-blot of the cavern , the drop of sweat from the brothel , trials undergone , temptations welcomed , orgies cast forth , the turn which characters have taken as they became abased , the trace of prostitution in souls of which their grossness rendered them capable , and on the vesture of the porters of rome the mark of messalina 's elbowing
0	this spectre , this past , is given to falsifying its own passport
0	the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger ; and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned , he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf , and stifling his laugh , bent down , picked up a handful of snow from the pavement , and thrust it abruptly into her back , between her bare shoulders
0	she had not noticed him
0	he had been m le comte d'artois ' companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe , he had made the guimard crawl on all fours , and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff
0	they arrived thus , still keeping along the quay , at a tolerably spacious square
0	may the great devil neptunus spear me if i do not make you the happiest woman in the world
0	what excoriations in his lamentable existence !
0	they beheld madeleine , almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight , make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together
0	no , it is not !
0	as they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices , which indicate a baker 's shop , for bread is put behind bars like gold , gavroche turned round : -ah , by the way , brats , have we dined ?
0	that wo not pay me for my chair and pane of glass !
0	on arriving at the window , jean valjean examined it
0	he seized a rod and cleared out the temple
0	jean valjean 's generosity towards him , javert , crushed him
0	it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding
0	father , she inquired , whom are they about to hang yonder ?
0	the wind ceased , the torch was lighted once more
0	sire , his place is vacant
0	were it only by the identity of the law , the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water
0	and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both , and made her smile and him blush
0	no doubt , cosette did belong to another ; but should he , jean valjean , retain of cosette all that he could retain ?
0	each minute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead
0	and he fell fainting
0	men , women , beasts , age , sex , health , maladies , all seemed to be in common among these people ; all went together , they mingled , confounded , superposed ; each one there participated in all
0	his mother was named jeanne mathieu ; his father was called jean valjean or vlajean , probably a sobriquet , and a contraction of viola jean , here 's jean
0	if you but knew what my love for you is !
0	upon this spot , and for this duel , on the numberth of june , wellington had the good post , napoleon the bad post
0	it was not known how this had been effected , the police agents and the sergeants could not understand it at all
0	he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species
0	they sometimes admire him
0	the ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish
0	if we had leisure to examine with the reader , one by one , the diverse traces of destruction imprinted upon the old church , time ’ s share would be the least , the share of men the most , especially the men of art , since there have been individuals who assumed the title of architects during the last two centuries
0	nero was a titanic lighterman
0	i go out alone , whenever i choose , i sometimes sleep in the ditches
0	it is the knell , monsieur madeleine
0	on the right bank , the belt sewer will form the trunk of this branch , the secondary ducts will form the branches , and those without exit the twigs
0	buy a good pair of trousers of double-milled cloth at staub 's
0	she passed her days in caressing djali , in watching the door of the gondelaurier house , in talking to herself about phoebus , and in crumbling up her bread for the swallows
0	there come two creatures , muttered gavroche
0	it alleviated his wounds
0	the bishop alone remained ; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance
0	decidedly , thought he , i have been dreaming
0	the winning number in the lottery
0	it was denounced and repudiated there
0	in the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men , he shouted : so there is nothing for me !
0	supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole , this grating would have prevented it
0	i see a great many !
0	at the expiration of a few moments , quasimodo cast a desperate glance upon the crowd , and repeated in a voice still more heartrending : drink !
0	the man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom : montparnasse confined himself to the remark : -we need you
0	retorted his wife , the young lady ?
0	this lynch law was complicated with mistakes
0	price : one tooth , one franc , fifty centimes ; two teeth , two francs ; three teeth , two francs , fifty
0	thank heaven , nations are great , independently of the lugubrious feats of the sword
0	then jean valjean , like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality , pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary
0	but in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day ?
0	he was decidedly terrified
0	have you lost that fifteen-sou piece ?
0	in the midst of this witches ’ sabbath , he was still to be seen on the top of his pillar , like the cabin-boy on the topmast
0	jean valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook , not very far off , and that thenardier did not care to share with them
0	it is a simple door for carts , such as exist in all farms , with the two large leaves made of rustic planks : beyond lie the meadows
0	father , you are pale
0	let the reader picture to himself this bouquet , no longer vertical but horizontal , bearing a bullet , buck-shot or a biscaien at the tip of each one of its jets of flame , and picking off dead men one after another from its clusters of lightning
0	the antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the temple , and babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity
0	bruneseau held his lantern close to this rag and examined it
0	my champmathieu was arrested
0	and she had replied : this
0	hence the falls which they accomplish , and the stones which are thrown at themthey are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible
0	will you hold your tongue , you hussy ?
0	where are you going , you rogue ?
0	it does not hurt you if i come to see you sleep , does it ?
0	duvivier , ligniville , and desprez halt short
0	the man followed him
0	and you have to work fourteen hours a day !
0	no sin at all is the dream of the angel
0	progress is man 's mode of existence
0	he quitted the rue mouffetard , and marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the rue gracieuse ; he remained there about a quarter of an hour , then returned to the rue mouffetard
0	the peril of this position lay in the forest of soignes , then adjoining the field of battle , and intersected by the ponds of groenendael and boitsfort
0	in that fatal valley , at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended , now inundated by the masses of the english , under the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry , under a frightful density of projectiles , this square fought on
0	turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy , who has given with his blood , consecrated his fortune , evverything , to defend that cause , and to-day finds himself in the greatest missery
0	among other strange things , it is said that he chanced to remark one evening , when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues : what beautiful clocks !
0	it is our right to cherish suspicion , although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse
0	sir , said the little savoyard , with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence , my money
0	they ascended , grave , threatening , imperturbable ; in the intervals between the musketry and the artillery , their colossal trampling was audible
0	the cloister was deserted ; the canons had fled to the bishop ’ s palace in order to pray together ; the courtyard was empty , a few frightened lackeys were crouching in dark corners
0	what had that general lamarque done to you ?
0	in so doing you will perform a gallant deed to our lady , and i swear to you that i am greatly terrified at the idea of being hanged !
0	he had had great difficulty in reaching it
0	we are of the number who fallspeechless in the presence of young girls and flowers , since wethink them worthy of veneration
0	you can take me , for here i am : but i have done my best ; i concealed myself under another name ; i have become rich ; i have become a mayor ; i have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest
0	the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast
0	all at once he moved again in his chains with redoubled despair , which made the whole framework that bore him tremble , and , breaking the silence which he had obstinately preserved hitherto , he cried in a hoarse and furious voice , which resembled a bark rather than a human cry , and which was drowned in the noise of the hoots -- drink !
0	pain is always by the side of joy , the spondee by the dactyl -- master , i must relate to you the history of the barbeau mansion
0	fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh : -he is dead !
0	farewell ; my paper is at an end , and this forces me to leave you
0	he halted , it halted ; he resumed his march , it resumed its march
0	these myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner
0	he had succeeded in making his escape ; all trace of him was lost -- what more did he care for !
0	he has come to that !
0	if the little shepherd who served as guide to bulow , blucher 's lieutenant , had advised him to debouch from the forest above frischemont , instead of below plancenoit , the form of the nineteenth century might , perhaps , have been different
0	what is a fray ?
0	there are loopholes only in the south wall , as the principal attack came from that quarter
0	the same sentiment says yes and no in the human heart
0	the ring-dove found his hemp-seed , the chaffinch found his millet , the goldfinch found chickweed , the red-breast found worms , the green finch found flies , the fly found infusoriae , the bee found flowers
0	she purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the thenardiers
0	what he has , he gives to all
0	now , all the squires for twenty leagues around were intriguing for this favor for their daughters , and a goodly number of the latter had been already brought or sent to paris
0	the light of torches resembles the wisdom of cowards ; it gives a bad light because it trembles
0	i want a big gun , replied gavroche
0	it must also be stated that if a charitable soul of a bourgeois or _bourgeoise_ , in the rabble , had attempted to carry a glass of water to that wretched creature in torment , there reigned around the infamous steps of the pillory such a prejudice of shame and ignominy , that it would have sufficed to repulse the good samaritan
0	one morning it came to pass that m gillenormand spoke slightingly of the convention , apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands , and gave vent to a royalist harangue on danton , saint-juste and robespierre -- the men of 'number were giants , said marius with severity
0	now , he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the duc de saint-simon
0	so far as paris is concerned , it has become indispensable of late , to transport the mouths of the sewers down stream , below the last bridge
0	the roman layer , which is the most ancient and deepest , is occupied by the round arch , which reappears , supported by the greek column , in the modern and upper layer of the renaissance
0	at that word from cambronne , the english voice responded , fire !
0	at the same moment , an enormous , bristling , and clayey face made its appearance at the door , with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth , but fangs
0	yet he was intrepid
0	got the first idea of a timing
0	cosette 's mother continued : -you see , i can not take my daughter to the country
0	what is the matter with your hand ?
0	cosette had overstepped all bounds ; cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies
0	the crowd broke forth into fresh applause
0	jean valjean had instituted an undeclared war against marius , which marius , with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age , did not divine
0	quasimodo , far from releasing the bridle , prepared to force him to retrace his steps
0	and who ate her with their teeth -- have you a heart ?
0	he was really in doubt
0	in the neighborhood of the cemetery , a shovel and pick are equal to two passports
0	what a good misfortune !
0	so jean valjean was at ease
0	in that case , replied the brigadier , we can let him go ?
0	remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you !
0	all contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of poland
0	it was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search for his card , and had made everybody in the garret , from the jug to his wife , responsible for its loss
0	the gypsy broke the silence on her side
0	claude frollo ( for we presume that the reader , more intelligent than phoebus , has seen in this whole adventure no other surly monk than the archdeacon ) , claude frollo groped about for several moments in the dark lair into which the captain had bolted him
0	so be it , monsieur le baron
0	this took place in number
0	henceforth , the field was open to all folly
0	they also seized in his cell a half-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged
0	of course she has an outfit , the poor treasure -- i understood perfectly that it was your husband -- and a beautiful outfit , too !
0	they must be greenies !
0	how happy you will be !
0	add the crosses of carved stone , more lavishly scattered through the squares than even the gibbets ; the cemetery of the innocents , whose architectural wall could be seen in the distance above the roofs ; the pillory of the markets , whose top was visible between two chimneys of the rue de la cossonnerie ; the ladder of the croix-du-trahoir , in its square always black with people ; the circular buildings of the wheat mart ; the fragments of philip augustus ’ s ancient wall , which could be made out here and there , drowned among the houses , its towers gnawed by ivy , its gates in ruins , with crumbling and deformed stretches of wall ; the quay with its thousand shops , and its bloody knacker ’ s yards ; the seine encumbered with boats , from the port au foin to port-l ’ evêque , and you will have a confused picture of what the central trapezium of the town was like in number
0	the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date : their fathers in the flesh had been , either royalists , doctrinaires , it matters not what ; this confusion anterior to themselves , who were young , did not concern them at all ; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins
0	juvenal and tacitus alone grumble at it
0	the gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner
0	it was he who had brought those garments to montfermeil for her
0	this little tower had a platform , of which only the beams remain
0	on the numberd of april , number , the victory of montenotte , won by the general-in-chief of the army of italy , whom the message of the directory to the five hundred , of the numberd of floreal , year iv , calls buona-parte , was announced in paris ; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves was put in chains at bicetre
0	they must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being ; this dazzling awakens them
0	very good , said montparnasse
0	it is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself , and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it
0	he drew from his pocket a little metal whistle
0	should she ever find him again ?
0	that which was directed at jean valjean at that moment , was the lantern of the patrol of the right bank
0	the mother stammered : -with her injured hand
0	what have you done to me , gypsy !
0	thus they would be seized before they had even got out
0	marius was like a drunken man ; this picture restored his father to life in some sort ; it was no longer the signboard of the wine-shop at montfermeil , it was a resurrection ; a tomb had yawned , a phantom had risen there
0	if my son meets him , he will do all the good he can to thenardier
0	disappeared with the mother , replied mahiette
0	thanks to this thicket of pikes and arquebuses , the parvis was empty
0	she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly
0	it lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor , which are sometimes severe , and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought , fills in gaps here and there , binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas
0	as for the barrel of powder , it stood on a table on one side , near the door , and was held in reserve
0	if you only knew !
0	that day the air was so pure and light that quasimodo felt some returning affection for his bells
0	there is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft , for he has !
0	it seems , in fact , to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool
0	the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace , and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light
0	thought he , i shall not have time to strike an attitude
0	this night he has given my daughter back to me
0	several thieves detached themselves from the circle , and returned a moment later
0	as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs , they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person , who desired to remain unknown
0	do not mention it , the butcher 's shop is a horror
0	this letter , coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius ' thoughts ever since the preceding evening , was like a candle in a cellar
0	replied jean valjean , four paces will put life into my legs once more
0	we have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without entering it , and without introducing the minds which accompany us , and which are listening to our tale , to the profit of some , perchance , of the melancholy history of jean valjean
0	those are dangers from without , petty dangers
0	one has one 's caprices ; i should have liked to last until the dawn , but i know that i shall hardly live three hours
0	the champs-elysees , filled with sunshine and with people , were nothing but light and dust , the two things of which glory is composedthe horses of marly , those neighing marbles , were prancing in a cloud of gold
0	marius , inwardly , and in the depths of his thought , surrounded with all sorts of mute questions this m fauchelevent , who was to him simply benevolent and cold
0	and the chaplains of the sainte-chapelle , with their gray _amices ; cum tunices grisis_ !
0	they directed their steps towards the door which opened from this court upon the terrain
0	one gets puzzled in battle , as at a ball
0	whom are we accusing here ?
0	this word produced a magical effect
0	its sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics
0	savages who go naked , with their noddles dressed like a shuttlecock , with a club in their paws , are less of brutes than those bachelors of arts !
0	the owl often assumes this oblique attitude
0	it was he who cast me into this abyss !
0	the prim little drawing-rooms on m sur m , which , of course , had at first been closed to the artisan , opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire
0	this gable was sombre of aspect ; only one window was visible , or , to speak more correctly , two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed
0	it sometimes happened that cosette spoke of jean valjean and expressed her surprise
0	so that as the greek believed that he had as many gods as there were fountains , and the persian as many as he beheld stars , the frenchman counts as many kings as he sees gibbets !
0	he replied , with an air of not having roused himself from his revery : -why ?
0	through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture , something like the flue of a chimney , or the pipe of a cistern
0	they were bordered with currant bushes
0	this grating , a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay , opened on the river as well as on the shore
0	liénarde lowered her eyes modestly
0	one of them said to us one day , the sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot
0	while the husband pondered and combined , madame thenardier thought not of absent creditors , took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow , and lived in a fit of anger , all in a minute
0	quicker than a flash of lightning , the recluse had laid the two shoes together , had read the parchment and had put close to the bars of the window her face beaming with celestial joy as she cried , --
0	every day , every instant , he heard them walking on the other side of the wall , he heard them go , and come , and speak , and he did not even lend an ear !
0	at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence , for true philosophers always feel lively emotions
0	it appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth arondissement of the society of the rights of man , with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections
0	then , i was condemned for life for theft , for a second offence
0	the miasmas , darkness , horror lay behind him
0	where did you go ?
0	the whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were audible in the corridor
0	he no longer laughed , he was terrible , he went and came ; the fox was changed into a hyaena
0	she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful , but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer
0	her rosy lips babbled enchantinglythe corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up , as in the antique masks of erigone , had an air of encouraging the audacious ; but her long , shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt
0	and what was the question ?
0	i called you so much that you came back
0	her hair fell over her shoulders as in the morning ; but there was no longer a rope on her neck , her hands were no longer bound ; she was free , she was dead
0	his play is neat
0	art often undergoes a transformation while they are pending , _pendent opera interrupta_ ; they proceed quietly in accordance with the transformed art
0	one broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured leg
0	once , i heard you singing
0	said the king , scratching his left ear with his right hand , that makes a goodly bit of my city !
0	the officer did not persist , and retired speedily
0	there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses
0	quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image , moving blindly within him
0	you pass close to them every day , peaceably and with impunity , and without a suspicion of anything
0	and they would take her from me again !
0	what time was left to him , after these thousand details of business , and his offices and his breviary , he bestowed first on the necessitous , the sick , and the afflicted ; the time which was left to him from the afflicted , the sick , and the necessitous , he devoted to work
0	then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels
0	what have those cartridges to do with the venus de medici ?
0	behold the suffering on all sides of you !
0	a splendid scandal on mount sainte-genevieve
0	those heaps of filth at the gate-posts , those tumbrils of mud which jolt through the street by night , those terrible casks of the street department , those fetid drippings of subterranean mire , which the pavements hide from you , -- do you know what they are ?
0	sonant melliflua hymnorum organa , suavissima angelorum melodia , cantica canticorum mira_ !
0	she dipped her pen in the ink , and turning to marius : -do you want to see ?
0	monsieur rector , there is no mistake ; the little butcher ’ s shop , _parva boucheria_
0	a word with the toll-keeper furnished him with the information which he required : have you seen a man with a little girl ?
0	there they conversed in very loud tones about everything , and in whispers of other things
0	every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him , and he was obliged to sit down
0	if combatants are required , they must be provided
0	in this departure from the rue plumet , which had been almost a flight , jean valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise , baptized by cosette the inseparable
0	the unhappy girl fell back on her criminal ’ s seat , speechless , tearless , white as a wax figure
0	and the farrier six score livres !
0	he wanted no more of them
0	all three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure
0	but why do you not go to the inn ?
0	mother , it was the dog
0	their trees are full of birds
0	there 's one thing you ought to do
0	at the moment when gavroche was relieving a sergeant , who was lying near a stone door-post , of his cartridges , a bullet struck the body
0	it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences
0	it had passed and vanished
0	this time it is for me
0	as for the intrinsic value of people , it is no longer respectable in the least
0	this rag-picker was a grateful creature , and she smiled , with what a smile !
0	which does not prevent him from defending it , responded enjolras
0	it was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to saint-paul
0	all these revolutions were accomplished within him , without his family obtaining an inkling of the case
0	in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing , we shall show only one side and one episode , and certainly , the least known at that , of the two days , the numberth and the numberth of june , number , but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse , beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift , of the real form of this frightful public adventure
0	listen , master pierre , remember that you owe your life to her
0	rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer ; rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited
0	look at me , my son
0	he remembered to have stumbled , as he entered , over a bundle which was stretched across the door on the outside
0	the reader can take his choice ; we , for our part , are much inclined to believe that he was in a bad humor , simply because he was in a bad humor
0	the man grumbled , without pausing in his writing
0	it was probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight
0	you do not recognize me ?
0	it was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor , that the theft was committed in complicity with others , and that jean valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south
0	all at once , he raised his hand to his brow , a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns ; he remembered that this was , in fact , the usual itinerary , that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to fontainebleau , and that , five and thirty years before , he had himself passed through that barrier
0	jean valjean was fatigued
0	everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him
0	let us not despair , on our side
0	the bishop touched his shoulder , with gentle gravity , and said to him , nisi dominus custodierit domum , in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam , unless the lord guard the house , in vain do they watch who guard it
0	at length he told himself that it must be so , that his destiny was thus allotted , that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high , that , in any case , he must make his choice : virtue without and abomination within , or holiness within and infamy without
0	monseigneur , his majesty , or comrade , call me what you please
0	now , it was the usage of the house , when the bishop had any one to supper , to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the table-cloth -- an innocent ostentation
0	at a certain moment fear assailed them ; whether it was that he was fatigued , or that his head turned , they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger
0	the crescent of the moon , in her flight upward from the horizon , had paused at the moment , on the summit of the light hand tower , and seemed to have perched itself , like a luminous bird , on the edge of the balustrade , cut out in black trefoils
0	for several seconds , jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by that august and caressing serenity ; such moments of oblivion do come to men ; suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch ; everything is eclipsed in the thoughts ; peace broods over the dreamer like night ; and , beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is illuminated , the soul becomes studded with stars
0	javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed jean valjean as thou
0	what billows are ideas !
0	he lived there alone , we have just seen how
0	a breath of air which made its way in through the open pane , helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier
0	also , right once firmly fixed , the state must be strengthened
0	beyond the agnus dei and ave maria , mademoiselle vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves
0	forty years ago , the nuns numbered nearly a hundred ; fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them
0	at length , however , she fell asleep
0	in the meantime , dame aloise , delighted to see them thus bending towards each other and whispering , said as she toyed with the clasps of her prayer-book , --
0	he caused her the same good and the same evil
0	to mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its own
0	let us condense , in a few words , a part of what we have just written
0	the stranger resumed with a smile : i will not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron
0	the two old women accompanied him
0	his nights were frightful
0	he has already devoured , since this bording , in wild prodigality , two francs and ninety-five centibes
0	a few moments later , marius made his appearance
0	his feet were cold and dead , but his head survived with all the power of life , and seemed full of light
0	in the meantime , it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness
0	she had neither eaten nor slept
0	monsieur le baron is infallible , he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared , i am thenardier
0	after that i stamped on that gentleman 's hat in front of the officers ' cafe ; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow
0	meanwhile our philosopher reflected
0	i struggled all night long
0	certainly , if jean valjean had had a kingdom , he would have given it for a rope at that moment
0	it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread
0	it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged
0	the perspiration streamed from his brow
0	meanwhile , at the words , are you the man ?
0	he placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece
0	unexpected as was this encounter , this man was known to him
0	that done , he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it
0	a little beyond an affluent , which was , probably , the madeleine branch , he halted
0	this society no longer exists
0	javert was the first to alight ; he made sure with one glance of the number on the carriage gate , and , raising the heavy knocker of beaten iron , embellished in the old style , with a male goat and a satyr confronting each other , he gave a violent peal
0	i saw her first when she was a tiny thing
0	this order , as it will be seen , was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of citeaux
0	this is a fine book , said m gillenormand
0	well , father -- said marius
0	habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions , these emotions were more than she could endure
0	mademoiselle gillenormand , who did not like books , demanded in a low tone of nicolette
0	if the system of ambush and traps had not already existed , they would have been invented there
0	i will be a lady
0	any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
0	thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in
0	of what was he thinking during this profound depression ?
0	let us seek the real
0	the arc du carrousel , all laden with badly borne victories , thrown out of its element among these novelties , a little ashamed , it may be , of marengo and arcola , extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the duc d'angouleme
0	let that vile sand which you trample under foot be cast into the furnace , let it melt and seethe there , it will become a splendid crystal , and it is thanks to it that galileo and newton will discover stars
0	waterloo was against the english
0	one thing had amazed him , -- this was that jean valjean should have done him a favor , and one thing petrified him , -- that he , javert , should have done jean valjean a favor
0	the insurgents had , moreover , taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories
0	my brother has ways of his own
0	the flood in the river , divined rather than perceived , the tragic whispering of the waves , the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge , the imaginable fall into that gloomy void , into all that shadow was full of horror
0	the old fellow has not managed to play it , he does not understand how to work the business
0	had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor 's presence ?
0	hence , complex monuments , edifices of gradation and transition
0	when i once know it by heart , all will go smoothly
0	she had expected great results
0	that is what you have done to me
0	i tell you that i belong to my phoebus , that tis phoebus whom i love , that tis phoebus who is handsome !
0	where is the gypsy !
0	while he was meditating , toussaint entered
0	the gypsy had suffered so much , that nothing was left her but astonishment
0	the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house
0	let us , then , impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions
0	at the same time , he became more truly serious , more truly grave , more sure of his thought and his faith
0	there is for everything a theory , which proclaims itself good sense ; philintus against alcestis ; mediation offered between the false and the true ; explanation , admonition , rather haughty extenuation which , because it is mingled with blame and excuse , thinks itself wisdom , and is often only pedantry
0	the tooth-puller espied the lovely , laughing girl , and suddenly exclaimed : you have beautiful teeth , you girl there , who are laughing ; if you want to sell me your palettes , i will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them
0	king louis xviii , regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all , did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor , nor his grade of colonel , nor his title of baron
0	a gay girl , my good friend , a gay girl ! -- pardieu , yes , the rue plumet
0	jacques coictier bowed low and said , --
0	he uttered the word indifferently , and as though his mind were on something else
0	he was about to pursue his way , when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet
0	a singular incident supervened
0	moreover , as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century , this feudal salon was , as we have said , dominated by a bourgeois
0	there was also hebrew jargon , of which jehan , who as yet knew but little greek , understood nothing ; and all were traversed in every direction by stars , by figures of men or animals , and by intersecting triangles ; and this contributed not a little to make the scrawled wall of the cell resemble a sheet of paper over which a monkey had drawn back and forth a pen filled with ink
0	are his horns of real gold ?
0	these arrangements made , he turned to javert and said : i am not forgetting you
0	the blind clairvoyance of the revolution , breaking royalty in the king and the king with royalty , did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea , the vast storm of the assembly-tribunal , the public wrath interrogating , capet not knowing what to reply , the alarming , stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath , the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe , of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned , -- he had looked on those things , he had contemplated that giddiness ; he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the assembly-convention ; he had beheld , behind louis xvi , that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible , the terrible culprit , the monarchy , rise through the shadows ; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace , which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god
0	the illustrious wine shop of eve ’ s apple was situated in the university , at the corner of the rue de la rondelle and the rue de la bâtonnier
0	all the words which we have just uttered , must be discarded , when it becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt , in which one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights
0	never mind , he added , he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me , the old scoundrel !
0	the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain , traversed fauchelevent 's pupils
0	he looked for the mark on it , and held it close to the candle
0	my cake tires me
0	you ca not bribe me
0	fantine barely knew how to read , and did not know how to write ; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name ; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to tholomyes , then a second , then a third
0	the mother raised her head and thanked her , and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door , she herself being seated on the threshold
0	she dared not touch it , but she spent five minutes in gazing at it , with her tongue hanging out , if the truth must be told
0	this tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors
0	the executioner who was shedding large tears upon her , drop by drop , was about to bear her away in his arms
0	he realized it too late
0	the plate is quite full
0	when they tried to enter the house again , they found the door fastened and the house empty
0	the priest ’ s gloomy eyes flashed into flame
0	leakage is the word
0	none of the various agents whom marius employed succeeded in discovering any trace of thenardier
0	how does it strike you ?
0	she raised her dull eyes , in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely , and said : -monsieur marius , you look sad
0	what would you like to be ?
0	the stone was still there
0	it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked , that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb
0	so marius had disappeared ; all was over
0	meanwhile , the windows of the gondelaurier mansion remained lighted , even after midnight
0	when she disappeared , they heard a plaintive bleating ; it was the little goat mourning
0	je crois que c'est jeanne qui l ' a
0	against her breast was pressed the doll , whose large eyes , wide open , glittered in the dark
0	this is a family of minds which are , at once , great and petty
0	monseigneur , i love you
0	in marius ' note to cosette , jean valjean saw only these words : -i die
0	all was harmonious ; nothing was too much alive ; speech hardly amounted to a breath ; the newspapers , agreeing with the salons , seemed a papyrus
0	you shall be honest and happy once more
0	winter is a stupid ; it wastes its merchandise , it loses its labor , it ca not wet us , and that makes it kick up a row , old water-carrier that it is
0	i admit that asia is a farce ; but i do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the grand lama , you peoples of the west , who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty , from the dirty chemise of queen isabella to the chamber-chair of the dauphin
0	terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob
0	retorted the hangman , and you know it well
0	by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived , in one of the gardens which bordered the street , a sort of hut , which seemed to him to be built of sods
0	it will be remembered that cosette was useful to the thenardiers in two ways : they made the mother pay them , and they made the child serve them
0	well , any one who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment
0	the prioress stared at him
0	still , she felt that it really was hers ; she guessed whence her gift had come , but the joy which she experienced was full of fear
0	in number he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with laffitte ; but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs , he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor
0	javert was enjoying himself
0	in the majority of cases , it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner , in order to obtain from him the trick desired
0	m gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself : -that 's right , one and twenty years of age , no profession , twelve hundred livres a year , madame la baronne de pontmercy will go and purchase a couple of sous ' worth of parsley from the fruiterer
0	it makes use of the gouty man as well as of the conqueror ; of the conqueror without , of the gouty man within
0	the university covered the left bank of the seine , from the tournelle to the tour de nesle , points which correspond in the paris of to-day , the one to the wine market , the other to the mint
0	but we will devour you !
0	the book is about to kill the edifice
0	it is well understood here , that by the words venice , england , we designate not the peoples , but social structures ; the oligarchies superposed on nations , and not the nations themselves
0	add to this , all ages , all sorts of faces , small , pale young men , and bronzed longshoremen
0	i grant you three days
0	tis the hour of my appointed meeting
0	all of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families
0	the very reasons for his action escaped him ; only their vertigo was left with him
0	only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him
0	only the door and one window could be seen
0	at the third call , unanswered , your name is erased from the list
0	continued tristan , why do you try to prevent this sorceress being hung as it pleases the king ?
0	the curt , hoarse sound of the old man 's voice announced a strange degree of excitement
0	if it had occurred to them to separate into two squads , and to go in both directions , jean valjean would have been captured
0	the finite which admits of progress and sublime toil , they do not think about
0	beneath the social mortality , we feel human imperishableness
0	into the shadow ; that is to say , to the light
0	death , i make use of thee , but i hate thee
0	we have the will , no work !
0	he said abruptly : -what have you come here for ?
0	he shouted to his wife ; and , turning to m leblanc : -villain !
0	it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul
0	the acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy
0	the over-prudent , cats as they are , and because they are cats , sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
0	this brother , of whom but little memory remains , was a peaceable miser , who , being a priest , thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met , but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous , thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise
0	enjolras was a charming young man , who was capable of being terrible
0	excess of zeal ruins peach-trees and apricot-trees
0	sisyphus had thrown his rock there and job his potsherd
0	a little dust collected in an organism
0	at night , the gates were shut , the river was barred at both ends of the city with huge iron chains , and paris slept tranquilly
0	but you strike me as having the air of a gallant man , and it is safer to defer our affair until to-morrow
0	on the numberth of june , number , he relied all the more on his artillery , because he had numbers on his side
0	there is something of the unknown about them
0	the result was the whiteness which we have mentioned -- a whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance
0	if necessary , i shall employ force
0	it was only in number that the city of paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty francs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth
0	the judges signified their assent without giving their reasons , they were in a hurry
0	jean valjean , who had no recollection of ever having promised anything , remained speechless
0	i warn you for the last time , that if i hear a single bell , you will take the place of the manikin
0	had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard , the soul as well as the body ?
0	only , when he approached , it certainly was the same man ; but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl
0	come , let me kiss you !
0	the door was made of thoroughly rotten cask staves , which left large apertures for the passage of his hawklike gaze
0	retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet ; it was a peaceful and charming place , which was not on the road to anywhere : there people lived , and cheaply , that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy ; only , water was rare there , on account of the elevation of the plateau
0	the cardinal halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade
0	that night , thenardier was warned , without any one being able to explain how , and was not asleep
0	early in the month of october , number , about an hour before sunset , a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of d -- -- the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness
0	it was a narrow , natural basin , hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil , about two feet deep , surrounded with moss and with those tall , crimped grasses which are called henry iv
0	he went on , without removing his gaze from the window
0	say rather , retorted the cardinal , with a smile , _porcos ante margaritam_ , swine before the pearl
0	but in proportion as she advanced , her pace slackened mechanically , as it were
0	he was evidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not feel the earth crumble
0	municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in , some striding over the omnibus , others through the cut , thrusting before them the urchin , who retreated , but did not flee
0	this palace no longer belongs to the king , but to the people
0	it communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary power
0	at the hour when you read this , five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas
0	she heard no sound , she felt no people moving save in the tumultuous and glowing city , from which she was separated only by an arm of the seine , and whence her name reached her , mingled with cries of death !
0	they belonged to that class of men who , when diminished in number , increase in courage
0	when you spoke to me just now , it was music !
0	his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it , -- the bishop and jean valjean
0	certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy , which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority
0	there is a bacchanalian monk , with ass ’ s ears and glass in hand , laughing in the face of a whole community , as on the lavatory of the abbey of bocherville
0	i can not have her with me
0	he has been ill , and we have not known it !
0	jean valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse : you wished to be madame
0	people no longer had the feeling for what was grand
0	ejaculated thenardier , you are quite right
0	by taking two post-horses ?
0	the sand has covered them
0	behind , in the shadow cast by this trellis , a little boat lay concealed
0	captain phoebus de châteaupers , thou liest !
0	i do not dare fire at that man
0	they are a pack of rascals
0	but i do not like the benches in the galleries
0	and she sank down as though on the point of death
0	it was murmured by all who were there , to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present
0	the deaf man dropped his head , then he came and knelt at the gypsy ’ s door , -- monseigneur , he said , in a grave and resigned voice , you shall do all that you please afterwards , but kill me first
0	the street was narrow and the gutter broad , the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet , skirting little stalls resembling cellars , big posts encircled with iron hoops , excessive heaps of refuse , and gates armed with enormous , century-old gratings
0	he put all these questions to himself without replying to them
0	hence the welcome accorded to the gypsy was marvellously glacial
0	she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense
0	your barricade is very small
0	the tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace , laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man , and said to him : -you are going to get out of here
0	you forget a thing like that !
0	but she , she does not know what it is , it would terrify her
0	she exclaimed , it 's a very pretty farce , all the same
0	she no longer comes here
0	his eye was wild
0	i have a letter in my pocket for you
0	the candles , whose number had not been increased , cast so little light , that the walls of the hall could not be seen
0	effort is quickly exhausted in the grave
0	one of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him
0	he never went about otherwise than surrounded by a small court of bishops and abbés of high lineage , gallant , jovial , and given to carousing on occasion ; and more than once the good and devout women of saint germain d ’ auxerre , when passing at night beneath the brightly illuminated windows of bourbon , had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had intoned vespers for them during the day carolling , to the clinking of glasses , the bacchic proverb of benedict xii , that pope who had added a third crown to the tiara -- _bibamus papaliter_
0	the immense pile of karnac is a complete sentence
0	in three months , we shall owe him for four quarters
0	then a great hurly-burly ensued ; a vast movement of feet , hands , and heads ; a general outbreak of coughs and handkerchiefs ; each one arranged himself , assumed his post , raised himself up , and grouped himself
0	javert , who had come up at the moment of the accident , had sent for a jack-screw
0	he was looking at the dome of the invalides , which was visible from bombarda 's windows
0	however that may be , claquesous had gone astray and was not found again
0	the historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events
0	as on the previous evening , the sentinels had come in ; but this time all had come
0	but marius thought of the little barricade , and went thither
0	one of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off , and probably carried away with him , as it was not found
0	i shall be the proudest and the most joyous of women
0	words like the following could be heard there : -i do not know the names of the leaders
0	things will not go well , m le comte , until the emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals
0	whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have just mentioned , the barricade , for those who are inside it , remains , none the less , a vision
0	from this secret conflict , always muzzled , but always growling , was born armed peace , that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the european cabinets is suspicious in itself
0	feeling that he must be something in the state , he had chosen the career of warden
0	the eye was extinguished , but the tear was not yet dry
0	people re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it ; human nature is so constituted
0	the two slumbers may be good neighbors
0	if he were an assassin , would i save him ?
0	the reply was ungracious
0	the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him ; with one movement he plunged his hands , which were enormous , into the two immense pockets of his top-coat , and pulled out two small steel pistols , of the sort called knock-me-downs
0	and that crocodile on the right ?
0	they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed
0	he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are , in a manner , reserved for terrible great minds
0	kings make playthings of human pride
0	he feels himself buried in those two infinities , the ocean and the sky , at one and the same time : the one is a tomb ; the other is a shroud
0	there came a moment in marius ' life , when he swept his own landing , when he bought his sou 's worth of brie cheese at the fruiterer 's , when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker 's and purchase a loaf , which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it
0	do not you mix yourself up in this affair , said thenardier
0	the stranger turned round and replied gently , ah !
0	pekins , damasks , lampas , painted moires , robes of shot gros de tours , india kerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed , dauphines without a right or wrong side , in the piece , genoa and alencon point lace , parures in antique goldsmith 's work , ivory bon-bon boxes ornamented with microscopic battles , gewgaws and ribbons -- he lavished everything on cosette
0	i was there for every witness , every proof , every plea ; i could count each of your steps in the painful path ; i was still there when that ferocious beast -- oh !
0	the leaders of the right said at grave conjunctures , we must write to bacot
0	it was the apparition of youth to youth , the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream , the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last , but having as yet , neither name , nor fault , nor spot , nor exigence , nor defect ; in a word , the distant lover who lingered in the ideal , a chimaera with a form
0	it is to be to-morrow , i tell you
0	this delicate operation is called spinning
0	it was of very fine batiste , and in one of the corners , less frayed than the rest , they made out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters : the crown was the coronet of a marquis , and the seven letters signified laubespine
0	as she only knew how to sign her name , she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer
0	he had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban
0	at marengo , i received two sabre-blows on the back of my neck , a bullet in the right arm at austerlitz , another in the left hip at jena

0	each century has its saint-peter ’ s of rome ; in the seventeenth century , the val-de-grâce ; in the eighteenth , sainte-geneviève
0	there will be no recreation hour
0	jean valjean fell into more and more profound thought -- this convent would be our salvation , he murmured
0	in the winter they break this bread up with an axe , and they soak it for twenty-four hours , in order to render it eatable
0	m madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed
0	but all this caressing hypocrisy did not have its usual effect on the severe elder brother
0	what is the meaning of this ?
0	can these rascals continue their farce ?
0	at every jolt over the pavement , a drop of blood trickled from marius ' hair
0	on some semi-official occasion or other , i do not recollect what , count [ this senator ] and m myriel were to dine with the prefect
0	this pistol is in your interests
0	now , defend me against my husband
0	he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know not what power of making , or , if the reader will have it so , of authenticating , demons , and who place a styx at the base of society
0	after all , what was that adventure in the jondrette attic ?
0	and as he ran : -ah , by the way , where was i ?
0	m fauchelevent was not there
0	the wall above which he saw the linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could , at least , hide himself , although there were as yet no leaves on the trees , and spend the remainder of the night
0	marius said to courfeyrac : i have come to sleep with you
0	_jeune fille , le sapin n ’ est pas beau , n ’ est pas beau comme le peuplier , mais il garde son feuillage l ’ hiver_
0	the quincunxes and flower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight
0	a few streets away , the shock of billiard-balls can be heard in the cafes
0	that is in the opposite direction , said the provost , and it is not very likely that she would wish to re-enter the city , where she was being pursued
0	in the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a confused way , black , upright , indistinct , horrible
0	the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail , but his brain grow weary
0	how good warmth is !
0	their eclipse is never an abdication
0	why do you say you to me ?
0	for that was provost tristan ’ s way at executions
0	a white , dull light fell from a large window , with tiny panes , on the left , which usurped the whole width of the room
0	he had seen , and he was becoming blind again
0	while she was speaking , he fumbled in his waistcoat , drew out his purse and opened it
0	the attempt has been made , and wrongly , to make a class of the bourgeoisie
0	further on there were two female neighbors at their windows , holding candles , which the fog caused to sputter
0	her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one
0	all the cooks of the red cross apply to me
0	come , said he , there ’ s no great harm done
0	shy although in the right , violent although strong , it struck at random ; it walked like a blind elephant ; it left behind it the corpses of old men , of women , and of children ; it wished the blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why
0	they did not see each other , they did not contemplate each other
0	collect yourself , said he
0	have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts ?
0	he entered , then came out a quarter of an hour later
0	and she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent , and she said to herself : what !
0	and what would a sub-chanter of the sixteenth century say , on beholding the beautiful yellow wash , with which our archiepiscopal vandals have desmeared their cathedral ?
0	i can hear this sound
0	the gypsy beheld the piece of folly which the goat had committed
0	he had a certain cold and tranquil laugh , which was particularly dangerous
0	she opened her eyes wide now , and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean
0	he ought to read the four books of salvien of cologne , _adversits avaritiam_
0	an event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk
0	at half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister , madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table

0	bodies press close to each other in misery , as in cold , but hearts draw apart
0	the knife was approaching his head ; the moment was critical
0	who is talking to you of yourselves ?
0	excess of revery breeds men like escousse and lebras
0	from that instant forth he encountered nothing more
0	this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it
0	he had nothing left
0	for four years he had been waiting for marius , with his foot firmly planted , that is the exact word , in the conviction that that good-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his door some day or other ; now he had reached the point , where , at certain gloomy hours , he said to himself , that if marius made him wait much longer -- it was not death that was insupportable to him ; it was the idea that perhaps he should never see marius again
0	the lamp illuminated him on one side , the firelight on the other
0	javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of enchained authority is condensed
0	and so he made the cat
0	the best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes
0	yes , i believe that is the queer name
0	we will not try to give an idea of her gestures , her tone , of the tears which she swallowed as she spoke , of the hands which she clasped and then wrung , of the heart-breaking smiles , of the swimming glances , of the groans , the sighs , the miserable and affecting cries which she mingled with her disordered , wild , and incoherent words
0	but when the child is lost , these thousand images of joy , of charms , of tenderness , which throng around the little shoe , become so many horrible things
0	in order to understand what follows , it is requisite to form an exact idea of the droit-mur lane , and , in particular , of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue polonceau into this lane

0	no one took a step
0	in the last corner , they were talking politics
0	he is on the tree of the cross , his feet hanging , his hands nailed , a little cap of white thorns on his head
0	on the following day , at nightfall , he went back

0	what is the matter with you ?
0	at the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book , the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate , -- it was his hour ; cosette thought him hideous
0	and , making a mocking salute in the direction of the church , thanks , canons !
0	the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be , unhappily , well attested ; the accused had resided at faverolles ; the accused had exercised the calling of a tree-pruner there ; the name of champmathieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu ; all that was true , -- in short , four witnesses recognize champmathieu , positively and without hesitation , as that convict , jean valjean ; to these signs , to this testimony , the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client , the denial of an interested party ; but supposing that he was the convict jean valjean , did that prove that he was the thief of the apples ?
0	you have been sardanapalus , you have been vincent de paul -- it makes no difference

0	the abbe letourneur , preacher to the king , the abbe frayssinous , who was not , as yet , either count , or bishop , or minister , or peer , and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing , and the abbe keravenant , cure of saint-germain-des-pres ; also the pope 's nuncio , then monsignor macchi , archbishop of nisibi , later on cardinal , remarkable for his long , pensive nose , and another monsignor , entitled thus : abbate palmieri , domestic prelate , one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the holy see , canon of the illustrious liberian basilica , advocate of the saints , postulatore dei santi , which refers to matters of canonization , and signifies very nearly : master of requests of the section of paradise
0	they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase , and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor
0	the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
0	at the moment when jean valjean paused in front of the bed , this cloud parted , as though on purpose , and a ray of light , traversing the long window , suddenly illuminated the bishop 's pale face
0	he was in america what he had been in europe
0	this noise retreated at times , and again drew near , with melancholy undulations
0	half a score of steps still cling to the wall ; on the first is cut the figure of a trident

0	jean valjean was going there in search of her
0	i was told to put it in the post
0	he did not disdain his servants , which caused his wife to dispense with them
0	that he might , perhaps , find her there
0	what will you put in this box ?
0	but the inspector from the prefecture -- the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
0	as for grantaire , he had got beyond wine , that merely moderate inspirer of dreams , ever since mid-day
0	let us pause a moment
0	some one said : -i , monsieur le maire
0	you need fear nothing further
0	he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements
0	you are a fool !
0	the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly ; so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter
0	the door of our house is never fastened
0	he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment , which they know that they alone recognize ; he abruptly unmasked his batteries
0	then , gazing fixedly at m madeleine , he went on , emphasizing every word that he uttered : -monsieur madeleine , i have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask

0	does monsieur require supper ?
0	the sergeants of the watch were clearing a passage for it through the crowd , by stout blows from their clubs
0	from that moment forth , gisquette was nothing to him
0	you will take her away ?
0	fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself
0	now , is there any sense in these things ?
0	he drew up prospectuses , translated newspapers , annotated editions , compiled biographies , etc
0	while the grandfather , in full lyrical effusion , was listening to himself , cosette and marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at each other
0	he had only some small change in his fob
0	the beggar was at his post
0	then all horrors become possible
0	an unheard-of virtue , supreme and sweet , humble in its immensity , appeared to him
0	what a resplendent figure stood out , like something luminous even in the sunlight !
0	gavroche immediately began to take observations
0	the bishop 's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures
0	is it not enough that you should know it ?
0	had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef , could no longer divine the snare , no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses ?
0	he continued his descent
0	then you have no longer any one but me to deal with
0	she resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over : -you do not seem glad to see me
0	are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome ?
0	it did not take much more than this to swell m gillenormand 's rage
0	what do you wish me to say to you ?
0	to please you , o athenians !
0	the gentlemen of the police enter , and not knowing just at the first moment what the matter was , and being merry , they beat me
0	here is a veritable mortal who is not exact
0	this was the third phase of his ascent

0	the second had a pallid and smiling countenance , with which the reader is already acquainted
0	you shall have your plot in the garden , you shall cultivate it , and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as mine
0	it is thus that , athwart the cloud which formed about him , when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other , m mabeuf remained rather puerilely , but profoundly serene
0	how sad i shall be !
0	i have caught you in the very act , said cosette
0	however , he was present in the person of father gillenormand
0	he read : -my amiable neighbor , young man : i have learned of your goodness to me , that you paid my rent six months ago

0	my brother made him drink that good mauves wine , which he does not drink himself , because he says that wine is expensive

0	a black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short

0	the city spends them in sewers
0	the sheet which he held , although royalist , of course , announced for the following day , without any softening phrases , one of these little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in paris : that the students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the place du pantheon , at midday , -- to deliberate
0	no one could tell him this
0	they rubbed a black heifer over with chalk , and said , she is white , bos cretatus
0	everything smiles , sings and offers itself
0	then she scrutinized marius , assumed a singular air and said : -do you know , mr marius , that you are a very handsome fellow ?
0	the granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant
0	when he arrived there he turned and said to javert , in a voice that was barely audible : -i advise you not to disturb me at this moment
0	if such a hell existed , that bit of the boulevard de l'hopital might have formed the entrance to it
0	as he uttered these last words , his air became utterly distracted
0	at the same moment a little oblong packet , enveloped in blue paper , fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat
0	and jean valjean thought to himself : -here is cosette 's education already provided
0	it was the prognostication of the philosopher who sees human thought , volatilized by the press , evaporating from the theocratic recipient
0	yes , i have said a turk , and i will not retract
0	they are warming themselves , much pleasure may it give them !
0	and wounded the child !
0	in the revolution of july , as in all progress accomplished by fits and starts , there had been secret fractures ; these riots rendered them perceptible
0	this is what marius heard : -listen carefully
0	it is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize some one whom one does not know
0	and then , their knives ; they ca not be able to cut well with them !
0	should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable ?

0	heavy masses , the multitudes which are fragile because of their very weight , fear adventures ; and there is a touch of adventure in the ideal
0	father mabeuf raised his head
0	the first grisette who had said to him : you are handsome !
0	he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere
0	what a melancholy thing not to know the address of one 's soul !
0	she said , when i get rich , i will have my cosette with me ; and she laughed
0	replied jehan bravely , i stand in need of money
0	it is more asiatic
0	she replied by a negative sign of the head , and her pensive glance fixed itself upon the vault of the ceiling
0	cosette , a bird herself , liked to rise early
0	cowardly chatterer , with a slipper for a helmet !
0	and flinging away his bit of gun-barrel , and folding his arms , he offered his breast
0	i am the daughter of my father , perhaps
0	our hearts quiver so , and human life is such a mystery that , even in the case of a civic murder , even in a murder for liberation , if there be such a thing , the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race
0	i tell you that we are talking business , go , my little cosette , leave us alone for a moment
0	two bottles never yet astonished a man
0	then i will pray to god and i will think of you here , so that you may be successful

0	chapter v end of the story of the cake
0	he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people , over what we now call the idea of the nationality , had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case
0	a street lantern reddened the margin of the quay
0	an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle
0	you might have shouted stop thief ' a bit , and i should not have thought it improper
0	nevertheless , jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety
0	from the man he had easily reached the name
0	this hovel , built of old rubbish , which was still in existence in number , was composed , as the reader already knows , of three chambers , all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls
0	this is , no doubt , what the bishop of d -- -- thought
0	certainly , at that fine moment , thieves and pseudo sufferers , doctors in stealing , and vagabonds , were thinking much less of delivering the gypsy than of pillaging notre-dame
0	he finished her thought
0	why does your mother always wear that surcoat with armorial designs , like our grandmothers of the time of charles vii ?
0	there are some among you who have families , mothers , sisters , wives , children
0	this panchaud , alias printanier , alias bigrenaille , figured later on in many criminal trials , and became a notorious rascal
0	that is all you know of it ?
0	a monstrous thought had just presented itself to her
0	and that amuses you ?
0	jean valjean had not uttered a single word
0	yes , said he , as though speaking to himself , he certainly must be dead
0	on the whole , he did not know what to think of the whole affair
0	and turning to jean valjean : -what do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end of the street ?
0	then , like a body which recovers its centre of gravity , he became motionless once more , but his words betrayed no less agitation
0	in the mists which enveloped his thoughts , he did not recognize javert , who , bound to his post , had not so much as moved his head during the whole of the attack on the barricade , and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge
0	he dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair , and he even said to himself , in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light , that there was not a ribbon of her gown , not a mesh in her stockings , not a fold in her bodice , which was not his
0	this time he will not come back !
0	the revolution of july instantly had friends and enemies throughout the entire world
0	it will be remembered that it was at the opposite point , in the direction of the genappe road , that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place
0	there the carnival forms part of politics
0	his face , which was in the shadow , was not distinguishable
0	and have you come from far like this ?
0	this remark trotted through fauchelevent 's head all night long
0	the old man did not appear to notice it , and held both his arms with one hand , with the sovereign indifference of absolute force
0	he said , complaints and fault finding against our garrisons in picardy !
0	sighed joannes de molendino , still perched in the foliage of his capital
0	he played in the tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair , and in order that the inspectors might not grumble , i stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel , with my cane
0	this festival was very recent , having taken place on the numberst of may
0	the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on
0	jean valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight , at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive , so wholly satisfied with himself alone
0	an aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which was furthest from the wine-shop , so that an exit was possible at this point
0	in fact , i think that to-day , with the present weather , louis philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions , he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people , and open the umbrella end against heaven
0	profit by that unique minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles , even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the frogs
0	on the following month they were again in need of money
0	he often saw herself with her goat , sometimes with quasimodo
0	towards four o'clock , the english line drew back
0	while they were passing their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys , jean valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery , had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated thither
0	its two slopes have been appropriated for the monumental hillock
0	he had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the child 's flight
0	he got out of the coffin , and helped fauchelevent to nail on the lid again
0	he added the grandfather , which produced a good effect
0	they plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets
0	je t'obeissais , tu m ' etais soumise ; o grenier dore !
0	one detail , which we must not omit , is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys
0	and do you know , my charming young lady , and you , my generous protector , do you know , you who breathe forth virtue and goodness , and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her prayers ? -- for i have brought up my children religiously , sir

0	total for waterloo , forty-one per cent ; one hundred and forty-four thousand combatants ; sixty thousand dead
0	then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown , she pressed it to her heart , she felt its angles against her flesh ; and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment , he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy , which overflowed from beneath her eyelids -- oh yes !
0	there is also the company of our unattached archers of monsieur de châteaupers : you will take it
0	jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless
0	the mass beside the atom ; the strip of ruined wall and the broken bowl , -- threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish
0	obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter
0	here jean valjean made his appearance
0	political opinions should be strictly forbidden
0	nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell , wailing amid the shadows
0	the scholar remained silent for a moment , with his finger in his ear , his eyes on the ground , and a discomfited mien
0	at last he reached the end of the street
0	i say skilfully , because , by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share , and , at the same stroke , to conceal one 's crime , and to enjoy one 's theft , to bury one 's name and to create for oneself a family
0	an instant later cosette entered the public room
0	this time the forty-sou piece escaped him , and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached jean valjean
0	the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm
0	you must not confound styles
0	at what age did you come to france ?
0	for m fauchelevent , independent gentleman , belonged to the national guard ; he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of number
0	he 's not a good student
0	yes , replied the doctor
0	you must pay on the spot , said the thenardier , in her curt and peremptory fashion
0	went on a merchant with the appearance of a jew
0	the poor fellow , supposing that the provost was asking his name , broke the silence which he habitually preserved , and replied , in a harsh and guttural voice , quasimodo
0	they had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature
0	good , he said to himself , those unhappy girls dropped it
0	the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness
0	boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able
0	the city found there all that is required for a city like paris ; a chapel in which to pray to god ; a _plaidoyer_ , or pleading room , in which to hold hearings , and to repel , at need , the king ’ s people ; and under the roof , an _arsenac_ full of artillery
0	a marvellous thing in number was a gentleman bearing the king ’ s commission , and whose letters of institution ran back to the epoch of the marriage of the natural daughter of louis xi
0	said mahiette , suddenly retracing her steps , and clasping her son ’ s arm forcibly
0	an almost imperceptible flush crossed m leblanc 's brow , and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level , with his accustomed placidity : -no more than before
0	say that i must stay
0	hence , in these not very attractive places , indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet : melancholy , the apparently objectless promenades of the dreamer
0	sometimes , in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger
0	it was obvious that this gate and those hinges , carefully oiled , were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed
0	one of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle
0	you can certainly talk before me
0	hence the isolation of monseigneur bienvenu
0	dry happiness resembles dry bread
0	at length , by dint of mounting on each other 's backs , aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase , climbing up the walls , clinging to the ceiling , slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door , the last one who offered resistance , a score of assailants , soldiers , national guardsmen , municipal guardsmen , in utter confusion , the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent , blinded by blood , furious , rendered savage , made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor
0	when one sees them , one never sees anything but their mouths
0	with the reader ’ s consent , we will endeavor to retrace in thought , the impression which he would have experienced in company with us on crossing the threshold of that grand hall , in the midst of that tumultuous crowd in surcoats , short , sleeveless jackets , and doublets
0	in such cases , there is no love which holds fast ; the sewer extinguishes it
0	the family who occupy the house had for their grandfather guillaume van kylsom , the old gardener , dead long since
0	a goodly number of bourgeois are sauntering , as we say , here and there , turning over with their feet the extinct brands of the bonfire , going into raptures in front of the pillar house , over the memory of the fine hangings of the day before , and to-day staring at the nails that secured them a last pleasure
0	what a fine lot adam has !
0	that is my husband , said the thenardier
0	she clapped her hands and exclaimed : -we have been looking everywhere for that !
0	this incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil
0	she pressed in her hand , small , bony , and feeble as that of a skeleton , guelemer 's huge , coarse fingers , and continued : -you know well that i am no fool
0	the sky was perfectly serene
0	that is why i have just told you all this
0	but this did not suit eustache
0	when the skilful had finished , the immense vice of their solution became apparent
0	we must have the mystery instantly , resumed the student ; or else , my advice is that we should hang the bailiff of the courts , by way of a morality and a comedy
0	jean valjean fired the second charge
0	he questioned himself ; he felt himself ; all these vanished realities made him dizzy
0	you can open your eyes again
0	he incessantly gazed at , and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath , the short locks on the nape of her neck , and he declared to himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him , marius
0	a certain clever ignorance constitutes a force ; you do not distrust it , and you are caught by it
0	the rumor spread in the university that the rue tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady
0	cosette was happy , and marius was satisfied
0	what was he to do ?
0	all passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery
0	this danger was a great one , but the peril of retreating was still greater
0	she worked for her living ; then , still for the sake of her living , -- for the heart , also , has its hunger , -- she loved
0	the drum holds its peace ; reason takes the word
0	this is the problem which presented itself to him : in what manner was jean valjean to behave in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius ?
0	this fanaticism was neither a dogma , nor an idea , nor an art , nor a science ; it was a man : enjolras
0	exclaimed coppenole , whose eyes suddenly flashed , that reminds me of the burning of the house of the seigneur d ’ hymbercourt
0	i wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it !
0	and , nevertheless , it is certain that quasimodo could have crushed the priest with his thumb
0	the reader can judge of the effect which this proposition produced upon gringoire , who beheld life slipping away from him , and who was beginning to lose his hold upon it
0	cain , what hast thou done with thy brother ?
0	do you remember how he said to me yesterday , when i spoke to him of cosette , soon , soon ?
0	the slab which closes the vault ?
0	a revolution can not be cut off short
0	they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche
0	all possessed the right of control over the roads
0	i should have been side by side with you in your existence , having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit
0	paris , that model city , that patron of well-arranged capitals , of which every nation strives to possess a copy , that metropolis of the ideal , that august country of the initiative , of impulse and of effort , that centre and that dwelling of minds , that nation-city , that hive of the future , that marvellous combination of babylon and corinth , would make a peasant of the fo-kian shrug his shoulders , from the point of view which we have just indicated
0	let us state at once , that this trunk never quitted him more
0	it vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us
0	on this occasion , the postilion reached its address , although the person to whom it was addressed was , at that moment , in solitary confinement
0	how was he to get out ?
0	and , in proportion as labor diminishes , needs increase
0	he was troubled by it
0	what must one be then , in order to please you ?
0	when donning his uniform of a national guardsman on the preceding evening , he had forgotten , dolefully absorbed as he was , to take his pocket-book
0	i am hungry , father
0	socrates should enter into adam and produce marcus aurelius ; in other words , the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man of felicity
0	monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language , which was very new to him
0	it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean
0	there one could hear the termination in anche of the old thuneurs
0	polignac is a rioter ; camille desmoulins is one of the governing powers
0	how easily children get acquainted at once !
0	went on diane de christeuil
0	so i shall have to nail up that coffin ?
0	said she , have the witches transformed my daughter into this horrible animal ?
0	the condemned girl remained motionless in her place , waiting to be disposed of
0	one cloud is dispelled , another forms
0	they are desperate scamps !
0	it was her last gleam of hope extinguished
0	her pretty djali followed her
0	the old man 's entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance
0	he hardly dared to confess , even to himself , that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert
0	he was stiff with cold ; he had eaten nothing since the night before ; he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of d -- -- , eight years previously , and it seemed but yesterday
0	he was a regular devil , and a very disorderly one , who made dom claude scowl ; but very droll and very subtle , which made the big brother smile
0	for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had re-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat
0	they hastened to carry away the little club-foot ; he would have driven her mad
0	they give me a crown
0	when the mass was finished , i watched him leave the church with his daughter , and i saw them enter a carriage
0	he was one of those children most deserving of pity , among all , one of those who have father and mother , and who are orphans nevertheless
0	let us repeat in addition that javert had scruples of his own ; injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect
0	his moral backbone leaned on that firmness
1	he went on ; the words spilled out of him , which is a feature of such heavenly paroxysms of joy : i ’ m so happy to see you !
1	it all depends on where the concierge draws the boundary line , for the pickings may be big or small , according to the whim of whoever is sweeping the rubbish into a pile
1	a feather crushes the man who lifted fauchelevent ’ s cart
1	i spoke to the porter and his missus , who ’ s a lovely stout woman , they don ’ t know anything about him !
1	jean valjean bent down and kissed the little girl ’ s hand
1	tell him that someone wants to talk to him in private but don ’ t give the name
1	he ’ s let ’ imself get played for a sap by some flatfoot , maybe even by a stool pigeon , and they ’ ve pulled a fast one on him
1	he had grabbed le cabuc ’ s collar , smock , and braces in his left hand
1	he grabbed the pistol and a faint clicking sound announced that he had cocked it
1	the expressionism of a l\tlnster , born of the labour of a science delibcrately deprived of a conscience
1	what was that about ?
1	the house in the rue plumet still belonged to cosette , having been taken out on a lease
1	the beginning of a shadow
1	in the blink of an eye and with all the suppleness of a young man , he was back at the hole in the wall
1	at the time people were just beginning to follow the innovative practices of laënnecnumber in the study and treatment of chest diseases
1	what have cartridge pouches to do with the venus de médicis ?
1	he wanted marius to understand , but marius did not understand , which made the old man furious
1	the expression that truth is stranger than fiction ’ takes on its full meaning here
1	he told himself he ’ d done everything he could and that now all he had to do was go back the way he ’ d come , quietly
1	to end the duel , to meld the pure ideal with human reality , to peacefully rub right into might and might into right—this is the work of the wise
1	on the one hand , a sacred tomb , on the other , white hair
1	this is why he simplified fantine ’ s burial and reduced it to the bare necessity known as the potter ’ s field
1	there , opportunities to get lost abounded
1	progress is the end ; the ideal is the model
1	a moment later , he turned the corner of the rue des prêcheurs
1	murmured cosette , i can ’ t believe i ’ m seeing you again
1	the whole convent thought he was stupid
1	all of them here are right
1	as for marius ’ s inner political revolution , monsieur mabeuf was wholly incapable of understanding it , of wanting it , or of directing it
1	that , as he went off , he was very sweet as usual and that all he said to the concierge was not to wait up for him that night
1	the objector will swiftly reply that the evils of the day before yesterday do not justify those of yesterday , which , in any case , were worse
1	come on , look at me , mate !
1	in the corner of the fireplace , a leather strap hung from a nail
1	the saying non pluribus imparnumber cropped up again in the stone rays representing a sunburst on the façade of the quai d ’ orsay barracks
1	this cavernous hold knows no philosophers ; its daggers have never whittled quills
1	it ’ s a crown tempered with a cotton cap
1	in , two years before the lumiere brothers invented cinema , munch had tried to puff up the painted image with a sort of sound relief , which was until that moment the sale province of music and its attendant notations
1	monsieur mabeuf could grow only a few rare plants that like rain and shade there
1	there is also such a thing as moral greatness ; we cling to it
1	forests are apocalypses ; and the beating of a little soul ’ s wings makes an agonizing sound under their monstrous vault
1	fantine had left her province about twelve years before and montreuil-sur-mer had changed
1	he still had the apple branch in his hand
1	all of a sudden , cosette cried : father , it looks like someone ’ s coming over there
1	mother thénardier was taking care of supper , which was roasting over a good strong fire ; old man thénardier was drinking with his customers and talking politics
1	the following week , thirty thousand cartridges were distributed
1	when he felt he was far away from all human habitation , he raised his eyes and looked around him
1	the house he lived in , as we ’ ve said , consisted of a downstairs and an upstairs : three rooms at street level , three bedrooms on the upper floor , and an attic above
1	after this average unknown man , who decreed the protest of dead bodies , had spoken , expressing how they all felt , a strangely satisfied and terrible cry arose from everyone ’ s lips , deadly in meaning and yet triumphant in tone : long live death !
1	here it is on its feet heading for us
1	the captive went on : do what you like with me
1	to start with , it ’ s a white sheet
1	very well , but madness too
1	she muttered to herself on a forlorn note : none of that , lisette !
1	happiness wants everyone to be happy
1	of the german battalion defending it , only forty-two men survived ; all the officers , minus five , were dead or taken
1	the revolution majestically taking back possession of france and telling the world : to be continued tomorrow !
1	from the second year on , bruneseau took on his son-in-law , nargaud , as his assistant
1	he was sleeping peacefully , untroubled
1	caesar , said combeferre , rightly fell
1	at times a death rattle interrupted her
1	he bristled hideously ; nothing is as awful to see as a wild animal , startled ; their frightened look is frightening
1	initial sketch of two shady characters
1	perhaps at this juncture it is worth remembering paul celan , the german poet vho committed suicide in paris in , the same year that painter mark rothko did in nev york but why stop there in art 's death roll , featuring as it does a constant suicide rate from the self-destruction of vincent van gogh , 'the man with the missing ear ' ?
1	she let him address her formally
1	only , when a child passed near a nun and spoke to her , the nun never replied
1	the thing is—and it ’ s a strange phenomenon , one that could not occur outside the situation he was now in—in stealing the money from that child , he had done something he was already no longer capable of
1	he jotted down a few figures in pencil on a scrap of paper
1	the love life of marius !
1	he had to be carted away and replaced
1	i put on my gruff voice for him , i frightened him with my cane , but he knew very well that it was all just in fun
1	if you like , you could say the hôtel de rambouillet meets the cour des miraclesnumber duchesses have their slang , too , as is attested by this sentence that occurs in a love letter written by a very great lady , and a very pretty one , of the restoration : you will find in such palaver a spate of reasons why i should want to fly the coop ( for : you will find in that gossip many reasons why i wish to free myself )
1	jean valjean had worked on cosette
1	she shall be brought to you
1	he had not thought for single moment about the girl since the day she had taken him to the rue plumet , he had not seen her again , she had completely gone out of his mind
1	the time has come , it seems to me
1	the day their eyes first met and at last blurted out those first obscure and unspeakable things that a look stammers , cosette did not at first understand
1	this street is so quiet !
1	then , as is the way with such black clouds , calm returned , and hope , and a sort of unconscious smile expressing trust in god
1	as unashamedly light as he was and without detracting in any way from his gaiety , he had a certain way of being , imposing , dignified , honest , and arrogant in a bourgeois sort of way ; and his great age added to the effect
1	cosette curled up into a ball of anguish in the corner of the fireplace , trying to gather up and conceal her poor half-naked limbs from view
1	the father replied : that would be imprudent
1	here , feel that , give me your hand , don ’ t be frightened , there it is
1	it felt as though someone had collared him as he fled and brought him back
1	he had put an old maid the curé had passed on to him in charge of it and had complete confidence in this overseer , an impeccably respectable person , firm , fair , full of the charity that consists in giving , but not so full of the charity that consists in understanding and forgiving
1	the heart of europe , after waterloo , was black
1	all kinds of rubbish had been wheeled in from all directions and thrown on , making the exterior even more tangled
1	i ’ m no sleazy sluggard , that i am not !
1	his ruddy , fresh colouring , the full set of pearly white teeth that he ’ d held on to and that his laugh showed off , gave him that open , easygoing air that prompts people to describe a young man as a good lad and an old man as a good old stick
1	we could compete with what is known as berlin jewellery
1	this was , as you will recall , in number
1	who will plant the flag back on the barricade ?
1	he ’ s coming in a cab
1	monsieur gillenormand thought he saw a slight frown on marius ’ s brow , though marius , we have to say , was actually no longer listening to him , floating off as he was in ecstasy , with his mind a lot more on cosette than on number the grandfather , trembling at having introduced andré chénier so clumsily , rushed on : his throat cut ’ is not the right way to put it
1	in the last century , the worthy natoire , number one of the masters of whimsy now scorned by the school of rigidity , having got tipsy several times in this tavern at the very table where régnier got plastered , had painted a bunch of corinth grapes on a rose pink post out of gratitude
1	how he would have kissed his old white head , flooded his hair with tears , admired his scar , squeezed his hands , adored his clothes , kissed his feet !
1	they went to the convent : the best information and the most respectable testimonials abounded ; the good sisters had little aptitude or inclination for delving into questions of paternity , and without meaning any harm , had never really known exactly which of the two fauchelevents little cosette was the daughter of
1	where love stutters in such charming argot !
1	jean valjean said nothing
1	this is why the torch of europe , that is , of civilization , was carried first by greece , who passed it on to italy , who passed it on to france
1	the changer only catered to normal men
1	a brass lamp lit a tablecloth of coarse white cotton , a pewter pitcher that gleamed like silver , and a smoking brown soup tureen
1	he left with immense despair
1	on top of this , it is good
1	do we have to think waterloo was a good thing ?
1	rip up his shirt and carve up his sheets to twist himself a hangman ’ s friend , belt a few portholes in the door , cook up some false dog tags , knock up a few open sesames , snip his fetters , chuck his twister outside , lie low , keep under cover , you ’ ve got to be smart to last !
1	he walked slowly , with his head down , in an attitude of reflection and sadness
1	the day looked brighter again to her mind
1	he had a superior , one monsieur gisquet ; till that day he had barely given a thought to that other superior , god
1	second , where is it coming from ?
1	he had thought long and hard the whole night , he had thought long and hard the whole day ; the only thing he could still hear inside him was a voice that said : woe is me !
1	they headed once more toward the bastille
1	there was ash in his teeth
1	the darkness was serene
1	this man is extremely dangerous
1	he had not given up at the first sign of trouble ; he had just done all he could to continue on his way
1	it was midday before bülow ’ s advance guard could get even as far as chapelle-saint-lambert
1	you even had a parcel of clothes in your hand just like here , this morning !
1	she turned on the tap ; the child had lifted her head and was following her every move
1	if you only knew !
1	what you lot call progress ’ runs on two engines , people and events
1	he took hold of the chair and with a swift thrust of his heel , kicked the straw out
1	an intercepted letter went like this : the day is not far off when , at four by the clock , eighty thousand patriots will be armed
1	i was pretty desperate there , myself !
1	i ’ ve still got people to see
1	dawn and resurrection are synonyms
1	he studied the cul-de-sac genrot ; that way was blocked
1	a good hour passed in the deepest silence
1	to go to war at every summons and every time utopia desires it is not the way of the peoples of the world
1	give us back our fathernumber
1	she slept in her coffin for twenty years , with the express permission of our holy father , pius vii
1	only , he meant to put you in a convent for men and he got it wrong
1	she was as one with old gillenormand ; while he elevated joy into aphorisms and maxims , she gave off love and goodness like a perfume
1	when there were no more than a few houses between himself and this street that seemed to draw him like a magnet , his steps would slow down to such an extent that at times you could be forgiven for thinking he had stopped walking
1	she was handling the flower instinctively , innocently , without suspecting that pulling the petals off a daisy is to pluck a heart
1	if the wardens had spotted them , they ’ d have chased the ragamuffins away
1	cosette emerged from the nook in which she had been hiding
1	she doesn ’ t know anything about anything , it would appall her
1	his hat had been tossed a few feet away in the bushes
1	down there , the bottom of a bottle avows drunkenness , the handle of a basket tells of domesticity ; there , the apple core that once gave itself literary opinions goes back to being an apple core ; the head on the five-franc piece frankly turns to verdigris , caïaphas ’ s spit meets falstaff ’ s vomit , number the gold louis from the gambling den bumps into the nail with the suicide ’ s bit of rope still hanging off it , a livid foetus rolls by wrapped in the sequins that danced at the last mardi gras at the opéra , a judge ’ s wig that has judged men grovels next to a bit of rot that was once maggie ’ s skirt
1	was he trying to issue a warning or to launch a threat ?
1	the young mother spent the night at the inn , handed over her money and left her little girl behind , buckled up her overnight bag , emptied of its bundle of clothes and now light , and set out the following morning , counting on returning soon
1	jean valjean , doing violence to his habits , took cosette to see the festivities to distract her from the memory of the day before and to erase the abominable thing that had passed before her in the laughing tumult of le tout-paris
1	he no longer walked close by them as he used to do before ; he would sit far away and remain in ecstasy ; he would have a book with him and pretend to read it ; but who was he pretending for ?
1	they elect those they obey
1	it is for sale
1	they are pale and serious
1	but you didn ’ t cry out , which was nice of you , my compliments ; and i ’ ll tell you what i conclude from that fact : my dear monsieur , when a man cries out , who comes ?
1	it never crossed jean valjean ’ s mind
1	for everything , he knew all the best places ; he also knew how to kickbox and make his way around a gymnasium and a dance floor , and he was a natural with a singlestick in stickfighting
1	she went to the salon window , which was shut and shuttered , and pressed her ear against it
1	she sewed , she slept on a camp bed , she lived with a flowerpot for company , she was content
1	it is deduced from this that the victim was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time , through sheer bad luck , and paid the price in someone else 's place
1	is this an inn ?
1	the vault under the altar !
1	obviously he was just passing through
1	equal parceling out abolishes emulation
1	javert leaned on the parapet with both elbows , his chin in both hands , and while his nails mechanically raked through his thick sideburns , he reflected
1	it has been estimated that in salvos , royal and military shows of politeness , exchanges of courteous din , signals of etiquette , formalities of harbour and citadel , sunrises and sunsets , saluted daily by all the fortresses and all the warships , openings and closings of gates , etc , etc , the civilized world all over the globe fires off number , number pointless cannon shots every twenty-four hours
1	at first , and especially at first sight , he hardly seemed to be anything more , indeed , than a good old stick
1	he had already laid a number of them in the hour he had been in the garden
1	monsieur leblanc did not cut him off , but when he cut himself off , he said : i don ’ t know what you are talking about
1	children of the thénardiers , rented out to mother magnon , attributed to monsieur gillenormand , and now leaves dropped by all those rootless trees and tumbled along the ground by the wind
1	people would say : now there ’ s a rich man who doesn ’ t give himself airs
1	had breakfast at the tête-noire , to which castaingnumber had not yet been , treated themselves to a game of quoits on the paths by the main pool , climbed up to diogenes ’ lantern , bet macaroons on the roulette wheel at the pont de sèvres , picked bunches of flowers at puteaux , bought toy reed pipes at neuilly , number ate apple turnovers everywhere they went , and were perfectly happy
1	he wrote in silence
1	as they were downing their first oysters , a head appeared at the stairwell hatch and a voice said : i was just passing when i caught a heady whiff of brie from the street
1	one grave symptom was that they had caused unconsciousness and you don ’ t always recover from unconsciousness of the kind
1	she had a bit of a beard
1	fantine could not write , could scarcely read ; as a child , she had only been taught to sign her name ; she had paid a public letter-writer to write one letter to tholomyès , then a second and a third
1	the bench of the circuit court had had to make do with two underlings , panchaud , alias printanier , alias bigrenaille , and demi-liard , alias deux-milliards , who had been sentenced in the presence of the parties involved to ten years in the galleys
1	this was now the toned-down translation of his initial expressions of outrage
1	this awful situation , which had already gone on for more than an hour , was changing every second
1	gavroche , shot at , was taunting the shooting
1	am sick since my last lye-in , abandoned by my husband for five months not haveing any ressorse in the world in the most awfull indigance
1	columns were sent out into the fermenting streets , sweeping the main ones , sounding out the small ones , right and left , sometimes slowly and cautiously , other times charging along
1	because a man was at waterloo , that doesn ’ t make him a monster ; you don ’ t separate a father from his son for that
1	all the cartridges having been made and all the powder having been used , this table was now free
1	the whole rathole was lit up by the glare from a big cast-iron stove parked in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal—the stove that mother jondrette had worked on that morning
1	on top of that , he had in his favour that great promotion to the throne , exile
1	cicero was tough on caesar and he was right
1	then the revolution broke out
1	never in the animal kingdom does a creature born to be a dove turn into a rapacious white-tailed eagle
1	all flight should be a smooth slide
1	o , second step , how black you are !
1	who ’ s turned up so early in the morning ?
1	there was no longer anything in his face or in his attitude other than a pity beyond words
1	on june number , number , he was counting more than ever on the artillery because he had the numbers in his favour
1	what did this splendid ignoramus mean when , with everyone against him , no one for him , without provisions , without munitions , without cannons , without shoes , almost without an army , with a handful of men against masses , he ran at allied europe and carried absurd—impossible—victories against all the odds ?
1	every step he took going from one piece of furniture to the other wore him out and he was forced to sit down
1	progress marches onward ; it makes the great human and earthly journey toward the heavenly and the divine ; it has its halts where it rallies the flock lagging behind ; it has its stops where it meditates beside some splendid canaan that suddenly unveils its promised land ; it has its nights where it sleeps ; and one of the poignant preoccupations of the thinker is to see shadow over the human soul and to grope around in the dark without being able to wake dozing progress up
1	so what is progress ?
1	these were the mirages of those bygone days
1	the pure idea turns into assault and battery
1	the guilty party is not he who has sinned but he who created the darkness in the first place
1	the man took the four sous
1	in this frame of mind he had encountered petit-gervais and stolen his forty sous from him
1	he held his glass out to joly , who refilled it , then he drank , and proceeded , almost without having been interrupted by this glass of wine which no one noticed , not even himself
1	in their dreams , the fervent females were chosen by and possessed christ
1	a child can get away where a man is sunk
1	you will recall that he pretended he had served in the army ; with a good deal of embellishment , he would tell how , at waterloo , being a sergeant in a numberth or a numberth light something-or-other , he alone , against a squadron of hussars of death , had covered a dangerously wounded general with his body , saving him from grapeshot
1	he opened his eyes again , promptly sat up , shot out his arm , and groped for his haversack , which he had thrown into the corner of the alcove , then swung his legs over the side of the bed and placed his feet on the floor and found himself sitting up straight on the bed , not knowing how he ’ d got into that position
1	thénardier pushed the table in toward monsieur leblanc , took the inkwell , a pen , and a sheet of paper from the drawer , which he left slightly open , and where the long blade of a knife gleamed
1	the bridle gate and the pedestrian gate were two iron gates standing side by side next to a gate-house built by the architect perronet , where the cemetery gatekeeper lived
1	let ’ s see , father , said the old maid
1	that whole fortune really did belong to him !
1	certainly , as we ’ ve said before , adversity sharpens the wits and calamity is the highest form of education ; yet it is doubtful that jean valjean was in any state to unravel all the strands we have singled out here
1	his mind had two modes , one to do with man , the other to do with god ; he was either studying or meditating
1	so , ve will no t be talking about profane art versus sacred art but we may well tackle the profanation of forms and bodies over the course of the twentieth century
1	i ’ m an honest man , you see
1	he did not see monsieur leblanc and his daughter leave and decided that they must have gone out through the rue de l ’ ouest gate
1	old man thénardier retreated in good order
1	on one of the pallets , marius glimpsed a sort of skinny whey-faced girl sitting , almost naked , with her feet dangling , looking as though she couldn ’ t hear or see , and was not , in fact , alive
1	you decline , you descend , you dwindle , you even drop without being particularly aware of it
1	monsieur boulard , number whom i knew , never walked around without a book either , and that way he always had a book close to his heart
1	either the fairies or the police had something to do with this
1	in a week we will be in england
1	x the bishop before an unknown light
1	and on top of that , there was wainscoting from our grandmothers ’ day
1	the privilege of the cinematographic image is that it derives naturally ’ from this indeterminate significance which , in the age of history and of aesthetics – in the romantic age , in short – turns any life whatever into the stuff of absolute art
1	fourteen years for trying to escape four times
1	it ’ s true , the husband added softly
1	how abandon his friends who were waiting for him !
1	did you go to the other joint , rue de chauffaut ?
1	between cold water and hot water , it is the party of lukewarm water
1	you ask me what ’ s forcing me to speak ?
1	by the time you read this , five fiery steeds will be bringing us back to our mamas and papas
1	at every jolt from the pavement , a drop of blood fell from marius ’ s hair
1	the bishop looked at her in amazement
1	that is , come in
1	on that note , i say quite frankly , nowadays people marry but they no longer know how to marry
1	this one thinks he owns the pont-neufnumber and stops society strolling along the cornice outside the parapets ; that one is always pulling a person ’ s ears , and so on , and so forth
1	there are three of us
1	where had he come from ?
1	we will try here to describe these poetics , independently of the specific schools ’ they have come to be embodied in and the monopolies over particular names or concepts those schools have laid claim to
1	the man did not look all that much less ferocious or frightening than jondrette ; a mastiff is occasionally no less alarming to run into than a wolf
1	his feet were already dead and cold but his head was alive with all life ’ s potency and seemed powerfully illuminated
1	he made a good two thousand francs a year from it ; that was more or less the sum total of his fortune
1	she also noted that there were all sorts of things in the pockets , not just the needles , scissors , and thread that she had seen , but a fat wallet , a very big knife , and , a most suspect detail , several wigs of various colours
1	the mill is no longer standing , but the wind ’ s still there , blowing away
1	after a few seconds ’ rest , she set off again
1	he thought the poor soul had departed
1	i have only one god , one king , one sou , and one boot
1	maybe he would come out in some sunny stretch of a public square
1	like foy , his predecessor , number he upheld liberty after having upheld command
1	after a pause , he added : i ’ m asking you questions but you ’ re right not to answer
1	at the same moment , javert made it to the thénardier couple
1	how he regretted his self-sacrifice and his insanity in bringing cosette back into the world , poor hero of renunciation , seized and felled by his very devotion !
1	they ’ re all in jail now and can do no more harm , he thought , but what a lamentable family in distress !
1	it recognizes by the imprint of a fingernail on a piece of parchment the difference that distinguishes the jewry of the judengasse from the jewry of the ghettonumber it retrieves from what remains what has been , the good , the bad , the false , the true , the bloodstain of the law court , the inkblot in the cave , the blob of tallow in the house of ill repute , the ordeals endured , the welcome temptations , the orgies spewed out , the kink that people have acquired in abasing themselves , the trace of prostitution in souls their own coarseness made them capable of , and on the jacket of the porters of rome , the mark of messalina ’ s dignumber in the ribs
1	he saw the bed , and on the mattress this young man covered in blood , white with a waxy whiteness , eyes closed , mouth agape , lips pale , naked to the waist , slashed to ribbons with dark red wounds , lying there motionless under harsh light
1	she listened , bewildered , she watched , alarmed , and at each word that monsieur madeleine uttered , she felt the awful blackness of hate dissolving and evaporating inside her and she felt something indescribably warm and wonderful well up in her heart ; it was joy , trust , and love
1	in exchange for reality , you have been given a perfect outer show , a good semblance of a life
1	when fantine saw she was making a living , she had a moment of sheer exhilaration
1	oh , what an unbeatable promise !
1	that is where they skip school all day , permanently
1	jean prouvaire was only timid at rest
1	where the devil have i seen that man before ?
1	what moved the carpenter to show this to his neighbours was that , a few steps farther on , he picked up another note , also ripped up and even more interesting
1	the thing is , i ’ m cured
1	don ’ t you realize you ’ d have given anyone who didn ’ t know you quite a fright ?
1	to observe the urban outskirts is to observe the amphibian
1	éponine , who had not taken her eyes off them , saw them turn back the way they had come
1	then she dropped back onto the pallet
1	in any case , the solitude he found himself in was so strangely calm that this appalling racket , so furious and so near , did not ruffle it in the least
1	take this , you respectable people
1	the english occupied the french camp , it being the usual observance of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished
1	anyone who was hungry could show up and was sure of finding work and something to eat there
1	the man added : you can keep this note as your receipt
1	the -st stuck in his throat
1	they chatted between themselves in a quiet , oblivious sort of way
1	she said to him
1	say the children ’ s clothes
1	the greasy spoon was doing badly
1	so he had to go to arras , free the false jean valjean , denounce the true one !
1	the secrets of the rich are sponges full of gold ; you have to know how to squeeze them
1	a circle was drawn around the hearse
1	rather than borrow , he went without eating
1	this is not some fat-arsed bookworm , a student who actually studies , some pimply pedant , strong in science , literature , theology , and sapience , one of those ninnies dressed to the nines , with a different outfit for each faculty
1	though it ’ s dark already
1	in america , in a region close to panama , there is a village called la joya
1	to see such imagination at work , devising schemes that are nothing more than the wild and reckless inventions of the galleys , to surface from his peaceful surroundings and get mixed up in what he called the quiet chugging along of the convent was as amazing to fauchelevent as it would be to a person out walking if he saw a seagull fishing in the gutter of the rue saint-denis
1	monsieur leblanc approached with his kind sad eyes , and said to father jondrette : monsieur , you will find new clothes , woolen stockings , and blankets in this parcel
1	can you fix the wheel right away ?
1	this heaven was the internal light of his conscience
1	with the rest , i ’ ll buy something for dinner
1	we weren ’ t very happy
1	how long is the coffin ?
1	young man , said laigle de meaux , let this be a lesson to you
1	it is , as you will recall , at the opposite spot , going toward the genappe road , that the cuirassiers collapsed
1	so that is the formidable man we are dealing with
1	it is hard to tell what we see
1	the virgin mary next to my stove
1	people come and go , they chat , crack jokes , sit around
1	but he didn ’ t have time to relate anything
1	a cloister is not a building site
1	jean valjean was from a poor peasant family from brienumber as a child he had not learned to read
1	the code was now a mere stub in his hand
1	as for her finery , that airy toilette of muslin and ribbons put together so gaily , with such whimsy and poetry , full of tinkling baubles and the scent of lilacs—it had evaporated like the lovely sparkling frosts that you can mistake for diamonds in the sun and that melt , leaving only the black branches behind
1	jean valjean was still , for her , monsieur le maire
1	despite the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments meted out , when the wind shook the trees they sometimes managed to furtively grab a green apple or a half-rotten apricot or a worm-riddled pear
1	if the woman squatting had stood up , her height and her bearing , which were those of an ambulatory colossus fit for the fairground freak show , might very well have frightened off the traveller , derailed her confidence , and caused what we are about to relate to vanish into thin air
1	as far as anguish went , this was the last straw
1	why didn ’ t the man give marius some sign of life , when marius was in his eternal debt ?
1	whence , if the times are hard enough , those alarming commotions once known as jacqueries , peasants ’ revolts , next to which purely political turbulence is child ’ s play
1	in the fualdès affair , number which dates from around that time , number , they sided with bastide and jausion because fualdès was a buonapartist
1	what he had on his forehead was not the wrinkles of age , but the mysterious mark of death
1	they would serve him quietly , and if compliance meant making themselves scarce , they disappeared
1	hero refuses to wash leander ’ s dead body
1	he heard , so slowly he could grasp them one after the other , latin words that he could not understand rising and falling away : qui dormiunt terrae pulvere , evigilabunt ; alii in vitam aeternam , et alii in opprobrium , ut videant sempernumber
1	there was indeed no trace of a wound
1	what part of the country are you from ?
1	jean valjean had before him something resembling the two branches of a y which one should he choose ?
1	hurtling headlong into death is sometimes the only way to escape going down with the ship ; the coffin lid can become a lifeline
1	all the stoves were burning ; a great fire blazed merrily in the fireplace
1	as we have seen , prayer , celebration of religious offices , charity , consoling the afflicted , cultivating a little patch of ground , fraternity , frugality , hospitality , self-denial , trust , study , and work filled every day of his life
1	unless you ’ ve got a silver chin , tholomyès observed
1	i walked into a village i saw
1	she didn ’ t dare promise herself anything and didn ’ t want to deny herself anything , either
1	cosette tagged along without asking any questions
1	did he have any idea what monsieur fauchelevent ’ s political views were ?
1	here and there , over the grey surface , invisible arrow slits that looked like black threads could be made out
1	a moment ago , in book four , we saw one of the chambers of the upper mine , of the great sap of politics , revolution , and philosophy
1	the wall behind the rotunda was like milton glimpsed behind berquinnumber
1	for now marius distinctly saw that episode again , resurfacing like indelible ink over a flame
1	this very serious matter was being tackled by two people talking in low voices with their heads together : let ’ s start by finding the names
1	the plague was born in them , despots died in them
1	wellington was waiting for blücher ; he did
1	sometimes the things you see grab you and hold you in place
1	then , instantly calming down , he gave vent to a whole inner world of ideas in a flurry of monosyllables spat out with almost ironic emphasis : well !
1	marius , i ’ ve got an idea
1	after all , he was making this trip of his own free will
1	some said : they ’ re columns taking a break
1	whenever she had been chasing butterflies , she would run up to him out of breath and say : ah !
1	he suddenly turned to the old man , folded his arms , and fixing his host with a savage glare , cried out in a hoarse voice : hah !
1	'the n uremburg code estab- lished the conditions under which tests on human beings could be conducted ; it is a fundamental text for modern medical ethics ' , as axel kahn rightly reminds us
1	if only forty sous
1	perhaps he failed to consider what that dark side might hide from him
1	thénardier shoved his shoulder again
1	she spoke in picardy dialect , to the great delight of the boarders
1	in short , one day monsieur mabeuf left the rue mézières , abdicated his duties as churchwarden , gave up saint-sulpice , sold not his books but part of his prints—what he prized least—and set himself up in a little house in the boulevard montparnasse , where he only stayed three months , in any case , for two reasons : first , the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he did not dare put more than two hundred francs aside for his rent ; second , being next to the fatou shooting range , he had to listen to pistol shots all day long , which he found unbearable
1	there were in fact two men there leaning against the wall , squatting in the snow and talking in whispers to each other
1	one of louis-philippe ’ s daughters , marie d ’ orléans , number placed the name of her race among the artists as charles d ’ orléans had placed it among the poets
1	that whole tempest , that whole cloud , the war and after it the peace , the whole shadow-play , did not darken for a moment the gleam of the immense eye before which an aphid hopping from one blade of grass to another is equal to the eagle flying from spire to spire among the towers of notre-dame
1	the garden was enclosed by a fairly low white wall , easily scaled
1	at the same time as the two guns were relentlessly battering the redoubt in the rue de la chanvrerie , two other pieces of ordnance , one positioned on the rue saint-denis , the other on the rue aubry-le-boucher , were peppering the barricade saint-merry
1	then the old man had gone bankrupt and he no longer had anything but a horse and a cart to his name ; being without family and without children , he had turned himself into a cart driver in order to survive
1	the two generals had carefully studied the plain of mont-saint-jean , known today as the plain of waterloo
1	not everybody has a house to come into the world in
1	crucible into which fate hurls a man , whenever it wants to make a mongrel or a demigod
1	he no longer laughed his childlike laugh , he had grown morose and no longer received visitors
1	the driver wrapped himself up in his coat
1	you had to go quite a way to get it
1	number petite rue picpus without carrying away a cheery idea of it
1	what ’ s more , the riot was conducted according to the soundest military tactics
1	she sang it in a voice so sad and so sweet that it would make even a nun weep
1	pull yourself together , he said
1	no army or nation was responsible for these creatures ; they spoke italian and followed the germans ; they spoke french and followed the english
1	they polish and varnish the surface ; they are all turned out immaculately , washed , soaped , raked , shaved , combed , waxed , smoothed down , rubbed , brushed , cleaned outwardly , irreproachable , polished like a pebble , discreet , neat and tidy , and at the same time , by my true love ’ s virtue !
1	he was covered in blood
1	he started to understand , and as always happens in such cases , his understanding went further
1	he left the town behind , hoping to find a tree or a haystack somewhere in a field where he could take shelter
1	get going pronto and come back ditto
1	the man grumbled without ceasing to write : mongrels !
1	he is not , by nature , especially academic
1	a traveller had already come and reserved a seat on topnumber i saw his name on the sheet
1	you , warm cold feet in the name of principles !
1	heads down , get back to the wall !
1	cinema , says manoel de oliveira , as reprised by jean-luc godard , is an overload of magnificent signs bathing in the light of the lack of any explanation for them ’
1	he thought of cosette
1	on top of this , he was an impressive poacher and renowned as an excellent shot
1	he interrupted marius in a gruff tone : so why are you here ?
1	a name had fallen upon her the same way water from the clouds fell on her head when it rained
1	in the imminent peril jean valjean found himself in , this grim building had something lonely and uninhabited about it that tempted him
1	they hire a cheesemaker that they call a grurin
1	those men did not amaze one another
1	cosette had come out from under the table
1	a furniture dealer in the rue moreau asked : so , then , when do you attack ?
1	so he wore a disguise ?
1	the silence that the prisoner had maintained , the wariness he had shown that went as far as completely disregarding his own safety , the way he had resisted the natural impulse of anyone whose life is in danger , which is to cry for help—all this , we have to say , since it had now been called to his attention , posed a real problem for marius and came as a painful shock
1	they go to bed early in the marais , especially on days when there ’ s a riot on
1	i tell you , the senator began again , that the marquis d ’ argen , pyrrhon , hobbes , and monsieur naigeonnumber are no slouches
1	but behind babeuf , the people could smell gisquetnumber
1	old man gillenormand had now long since turned ninety-one
1	a rope was what was needed
1	coming out of the station , he found the same mud that the young konstantin paustovsky met with , in february , when sent on an assignment by his newspaper
1	she thrashed about completely oblivious to her nakedness
1	the girl looked at him in amazement and received the shawl in silence
1	tholomyès brought up the rear , dominating the group from behind
1	to be lying down side by side in the same grave , hand in hand , and from time to time gently to stroke each other ’ s fingertip in the dark , that will do for my eternity
1	what emerges from the graveyard intimidates and disconcerts what emerges from the lair ; the ferocious is frightened of the sinister ; wolves back away when they come upon a ghoul
1	you go , too , if we ’ re going !
1	that was his nature
1	give yourself a round of applause !
1	nothing comes more naturally to staggering drunks than elliptical expressions
1	and in the back of his mind , he would add , i owe him a visit
1	it was too much for the bauduin brigade to force hougoumont to the north , and the soye brigade could only make a hole in it to the south without taking it
1	gavroche shrugged his shoulders and answered : a kid like yours truly is a proper jock , and jocks like you lot are kids
1	he made himself a target
1	those are dolorous days ; for there is always a certain amount of justice even in such madness , there is suicide in such a duel ; and these words that are intended as insults , scum , rabble , mob rule , plebs , alas !
1	you are a baron now ?
1	a big fair-headed fellow on the boulevard says to me : do you know mother hucheloup ?
1	we will restrict ourselves to noting an incident that , although unnoticed by the wedding party , marked the trip from the rue des filles-du-calvaire to the church of saint-paulnumber
1	his instinct served him well
1	suddenly he raised his voice
1	he told fantine in his gentlest and calmest voice : stay calm
1	for pity ’ s sake , the man cried , a glass of water
1	hence a conversation between a barber and a soldier which prudhomme , number had he been there , would have embellished with a flourish or two and called dialogue of the razor and the sabre
1	the rubble fell on brujon ’ s bed without a sound
1	he placed the pile of five-franc coins on the old servant ’ s night table and went back to his room without saying a word
1	the emblazoned carriages of the peers of france and the ambassadors stuck to the middle of the road where they could come and go untrammelled
1	i believe you , said marius
1	say you make twelve sous in shirts ; if that drops to nine sous , you can ’ t live
1	he felt an impulse to use the gruff familiarity common enough with doctors and priests , which was not at all his usual bedside manner
1	in the twinkling of an eye we have , on the one hand , the birth of the portrait in all its humility , its discretion
1	who were her parents ?
1	how could anyone expect those nails to do any work ?
1	she broke off and , leaping over the sombre hurdles that were no doubt in her mind , she went on with a heartbreaking smile : you found me ugly , didn ’ t you ?
1	that ’ s the fault of voltaire ,
1	from time to time she bent over and took a peek at it , then she looked at the man
1	we say nothing of the mighty exile of patmosnumber who , too , shatters the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal world , turns vision into an enormous satire , and casts over rome-nineveh , over rome-babylon , over rome-sodom , the flaming reflection of the apocalypse
1	he was what was called in the ancien régime two-handed , signalling equal dexterity in handling a sabre or a musket as a soldier and a squadron or a battalion as an officer
1	in the crowd surrounding and cheering lafayette , people noticed a german named ludwig snyder and pointed him out to each other
1	at all points the struggle was escalating on a gigantic scale and the outcome of all the disarming , the house-to-house visits , the brisk invasion of armourers ’ , was that combat that had kicked off with stone-throwing moved on to an exchange of gunfire
1	in that second , a fifth uniform fell , as though from the sky , on top of the four others
1	what is the sun ?
1	and jean valjean did well to keep quiet and not to move
1	this went on for some little time
1	he did not much believe in god
1	javert ’ s face tensed the way it did whenever anyone believed him capable of some concession
1	at a certain look from the man , the mother shut up
1	the omnibus shaft , though truncated by the fusillade , was still standing upright enough to have a flag hung from it
1	there is such a thing as fine peasant talk and the following is an example : father so-and-so , your wife has died of her illness ; why didn ’ t you send for a doctor ?
1	the same formidable lightning flashes from the torch of prometheus to cambronne ’ s stunted pipenumber
1	i ’ ve made my choice
1	hougoumont and la haie-sainte continued to burn , sending up two great flames , one in the west , one in the east , to which the ring of fires of the english bivouac , laid out in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon , had just linked up like a loosened ruby necklace with two red garnets at each end
1	answer me , you nincompoop !
1	at the start , as we saw , she paid the thénardiers punctually
1	what sections were there ?
1	ask them what they do with their money
1	they ’ re ugly in nanterre ,
1	this was more than a transformation , it was a transfiguration
1	he promptly relit his candle
1	but if you then spent a few hours with him , and saw him in a thoughtful mood , the good old stick was gradually transfigured and took on an ineffably imposing quality ; his broad and serious forehead , made noble by a full head of white hair , was also ennobled by meditation ; grandeur emanated from his goodness , but without that goodness ceasing to shine
1	then the little girl began to laugh and , though her mother held her back , slid to the ground with the indomitable energy of a small being who wants to run
1	bossuet , said marius , but i thought you said your name was laigle
1	dark and deserted space lay before her
1	these same young men also met up , as we said , in a cabaret-restaurant near the rue mondétour that was called corinthe
1	so it was you , you little rascal ?
1	the rag mounted guard over the treasure
1	if there is to be a trophy , it is to the english people that it should go
1	what came from monsieur fauchelevent ?
1	what is this empty coffin ?
1	it ’ s not a few days in the lockup anymore , it ’ s the galleys in perpetuity
1	no bat can brave the dawn
1	the row of shops exposed to the wind that started at the church extended , as you will recall , right to the thénardiers ’ tavern
1	the two boys cuddled up together
1	yes , monsieur , if they take your fancy , we could give you these stockings for five francs
1	i say you haven ’ t , missus , retorted the merchant
1	a noise could be heard in the house ; it was the lark sweeping the stairs
1	but he could not provide himself with an answer , except that he looked like someone who had left a dim trace in his mind
1	good day , mamselle back-of-a-bus , gavroche said to her
1	she watched him for a long time without daring to interrupt
1	the walls , which had been washed with a yellow ochre limewash , were peeling off in big chunks of plaster
1	he could not have said
1	when the workers come tomorrow to patch up the hole they ’ d have found the poor sucker left there , for sure , and bit by bit , one way or another , they ’ d have been able to sniff you out and track you down
1	another cannonade could be heard some distance away
1	it 's about an internal conflict as well , over the duty incumbent upon the poet not indecorously to step over the carpet of the scourge ’ of which he must understand the mystery and judge the duty ’
1	most of the wounded were able and willing to fight still
1	there , more than ever , he would see that star and , less than ever , savigny and gans
1	there they are , all the kings of europe , the happy generals , the thundering jupiters , there are one hundred thousand victorious soldiers and behind the hundred thousand , a million ; their cannons , wicks lit , are gaping ; they have the imperial guard and the grande armée under their heels ; they have just crushed napoléon and there is only cambronne left ; there is no one left to protest except this earthworm
1	you know how it is , you sometimes get these funny ideas
1	it was more random banter than conversation
1	and that was monsieur myriel ’ s budget
1	maybe god is dead , gérard de nervalnumber said one day to the writer of these lines , confusing god with progress and taking the interruption in movement for the death of the supreme being
1	even at the dark depth to which he had already descended , he could still feel ecstasy in gazing at cosette
1	the man had thrown himself into the blaze and , at the risk of his own life , had saved two children who turned out to belong to the captain of the gendarmerie—which meant that no one thought to ask him for his passport
1	that ’ s the fault of—number
1	this had given her , while she was still very young , and even a bit later on , a sort of wondering attitude toward her husband , who was a dyed-in-the-wool rotter with a certain depth , a thug who knew his grammar , almost , a man both gross and refined at once , but who , when it came to sentimentalism , read pigault-lebrunnumber and who , when it came to anything to do with sex , as he so quaintly put it , was a thorough and unmitigated lout
1	he marched up to the tollhouse and handed the man a sou
1	you may think you are indifferent to the death penalty , number can ’ t say whether you are in favour of it or not—as long as you haven ’ t clapped eyes on a guillotine
1	you had no father and no mother of your own , feuilly ; you adopted humanity as mother , and as father you adopted justice
1	for marius to reach this state of prosperity had taken years
1	they had thrown the doll on the ground and éponine , who was the elder , was wrapping the little cat up despite its meowings and contortions , in a whole pile of old red and blue rags
1	they fell into the frightening error of mistaking the soldier ’ s obedience for the nation ’ s consent
1	simplice of sicily , as we know , was the saint who preferred to have both breasts ripped off rather than say that she was born in segesta , when she was born in syracuse—a lie that would have saved her
1	the idea that there is someone there with something to tell me—i laugh just thinking about it
1	he opened his mouth , turned to the judge and said : first off …
1	she followed this up in an elegiac and lamenting tone : oh , monsieur !
1	monsieur le baron , i will tell you all , leaving the reward to your generosity
1	for if certain works speak , those that shout and scream - their pain or hate - would soon abolish all dialogue and rule out any form of questioning
1	monsieur , he said , where are we up to ?
1	the mattress was a straw mat , the cover was a fairly voluminous loose skirt of coarse grey wool that was very warm and almost new
1	thénardier rapidly unfolded the note and brought it over to the candle
1	the writing had left its imprint on the blotter
1	just then a light came on at the end of the street ; a pine branch , hanging from an iron stand , stood out against the white sky of twilight
1	the proprietor had a great nickname ; they called him rousseau , the aquatic
1	after that , what is left of adorno 's pompous pronouncement about the impossibility of writing a poem after auschwitz ?
1	we might even go so far as to say , a dark light
1	science , having groped about for a long time , now knows that the most fertilizing and the most effective of manures is human manure

1	sludge ’ s load-bearing capacity varies with its density
1	except for the two or three streets we will be dealing with , it was all walls and vacant lots

1	he said he begged to be excused
1	he seemed to be thinking
1	yes , of course he did , his exhilaration
1	out of piety for his father , marius had almost come to feel aversion for his grandfather
1	it always achieves its aim , strangely
1	one is a spirit , one will be an angel , one will sprout blue wings from one ’ s back
1	and it will really take you a day to fix the wheel ?
1	the mother cried impetuously : you always have to go one better than everyone else , don ’ t you !
1	is it midday or midnight ?
1	you lie on a bed of purple , my dear senator
1	monsieur mabeuf opened his bookcase , but there was nothing left there
1	marius examined the man more and more intensely as he listened to him
1	marius steps into the shadows
1	executioner , le taule ; forest , le sabri ; fear , flight , taf ; lackey , le larbin ; general , prefect , minister , pharos ; the devil , le rabouin
1	she would give me a smile , she would have a word with me
1	monsieur mabeuf now had only his books , his garden , and his indigo ; these things were , for him , the three forms happiness , pleasure , and hope had taken
1	sometimes a stream abruptly causes a vault under construction to cave in and floods the workers ; or a marl slide occurs , moving with the fury of a waterfall and shattering the great wooden support beams like glass
1	i did rob monseigneur the bishop , it ’ s true ; i did rob petit-gervais , it ’ s true

1	it was in the garden of the convent of the rue du temple that a chestnut tree from india , said to be the most beautiful and the tallest in france , stood ; among the good folk of the eighteenth century it had the reputation of being the father of all the chestnut trees in the realm
1	it was this man who had just stumbled on cosette
1	night had well and truly fallen , but nothing happened
1	montfermeil is in the country
1	cosette ’ s pace slowed jean valjean down
1	the seventh art thus becomes a ventriloquist art delivering its own oracles
1	she bit her lip ; she seemed to hesitate as though in the grip of some sort of inner struggle
1	it is especially in the faubourgs , we must insist , that the parisian race appears
1	how do you expect them to live ?
1	all this explains why the first revolutions were content just to find a man , a cromwell or a napoléon ; and why the next revolutions insisted on finding a family , a house of brunswicknumber or a house of orléans
1	i made him pay two sous , said the toll-keeper
1	a few days later , it might have been about eight at night , he was in his room getting cosette to spell out loud , when he heard the street door open and then shut again
1	being evil is not enough for a person to prosper
1	my faith , it suits me down to the ground !
1	a terrible water flows there in which bloody hands have been washed
1	that must be the deal they were referring to

1	sometimes it happened that some blundering officious person would speak to him of marius and ask him : what is monsieur , your grandson , doing now , what ’ s become of him ?
1	description of jean valjean
1	by a roundabout way , he came to a little street that he thought must be the rue de la poterie ; about halfway along , he ran into an obstacle
1	replied the child , as though the question was ridiculous ; and , with that , he took off his shoes
1	every man for himself
1	the little boys nudged each other ; the urchin frightened them and reassured them at the same time and then , it was raining hard
1	one day , following the example of the campaign to combat nicotine addiction , it may well be necessary to put up signs of the 'silence - hospital ' variety at the entrance to museums and exhibition halls to get all those 'communication machines ' to shut up and put an end to the all too numerous cultural exercises in sound and light
1	there , he stopped in his tracks , stunned
1	they assumed that indefinably dazed , mechanical quality peculiar to despair
1	monsieur gillenormand turned to all those in the room and shouted : talk among yourselves , the rest of you !
1	at issue was one of the questions of the moment , namely the artillery of the national guard and a conflict between the minister of warnumber and the citizen militia over some cannons parked in the courtyard of the louvre
1	this is the romantic principle of indeterminate significance or determined insignificance
1	he hoped , too , that from this violent encounter between jondrette and monsieur leblanc some light would be shed on all it was in his interests to find out
1	let a notary rise to become a deputy , let a sham corneille write tiridate , number let a eunuch come into possession of a harem , let some military prudhommenumber accidentally win the decisive battle of an era , let an apothecary invent cardboard soles for the sambre-et-meuse armynumber and let him , with this cardboard sold as leather , build himself four hundred thousand livres a year in income , let a hawker get into bed with usury and cause it to give birth to seven or eight million of which he is the father and she the mother , let a preacher become a bishop by talking through his hat , let an intendant of a great estate be so loaded on leaving the service that he is made minister of finance—people call that genius , just as they call mousqueton ’ s face beauty and claude ’ snumber bearing majesty
1	all this grass was sopping wet with blood
1	and what do nettles need ?
1	my name is jean valjean
1	you ’ ve killed the man ; fine
1	it ’ s impossible to imagine that god made us for anything else but this : to idolize , to bill and coo , to strut and plume , to be pigeons , to be cocks , to peck at our loves from morning to night , to gaze at our reflections in our little woman , to be proud , to be triumphant , to puff ourselves up ; that ’ s what life is all about
1	bahorel answered : what do you expect ?
1	between the image of general orlov and the images of the soviet epic and its disastrous collapse , there is no causal link that could legitimate anything whatsoever
1	police officers turning up without warning at five in the morning at the home of one pardon , who was later a member of the barricade-merry section and who got himself killed in the insurrection of april number , number found him on his feet by his bed , holding cartridges that he was in the process of making
1	the garden was deserted
1	at a pinch , it could be the old woman who might have felt sick and gone to the apothecary ’ s
1	ideas are such torrents !
1	you are the thief !
1	there ’ s the license , the taxes , doors and windows , number duties !
1	number , climbed to the top of the stairs , guided by the instinct that always leads the poor man to the attic , and knocked in the gloom on the door of a garret
1	jean valjean , feeling that he ’ d been seen and that javert was on his trail , realized that cosette and he were finished if they went back to paris
1	come out of there !
1	that ’ s good , reverend mother
1	truly , my dear bishop , i tell you , i have my philosophy and i have my philosophers
1	a minute later , i feel around and there ’ s nothing there
1	the real glory is in winning over
1	she moved like a bird darting its head out of its nest , looked first at her husband , then at jean valjean , and cried to them with a laugh , so that you felt as if you saw a smile deep inside a rose : i bet you ’ re talking politics !
1	as she read , mother plutarch came to this sentence
1	today i have a mattress of stone
1	he looked at cosette again , then took his hands off her shoulders , grabbed the bucket and resumed walking
1	the bishop listened to all this in silence
1	the biggest of them all , a kind of colossus , marched on gavroche with his bayonet thrust forward
1	two facts , two pieces of proof , said thénardier
1	the embarkation for cythera !
1	now , is it possible to be in constant contact , day and night , with every kind of distress , every kind of calamity , every kind of destitution , without some of this saintly misery rubbing off on oneself , like dirt from hard work ?
1	you didn ’ t have to tell me who you were
1	my child , said the man , take this and go and get dressed quickly
1	accused of congenital weakness , the silence of forms and figures suddenly turns into mutism : the mutism of abstraction or that of an indeter- minate figurative art whose victims were to be giacometti , bacon and co 'the less you think , the more you talk ' , mon- tesquieu pointed out
1	i did knock , madame
1	nuns are buried in white
1	well , then , shut up , capital r !
1	the man trying to escape was a scrawny skinny-necked weed , the man going after him was a tall strapping man who looked hard as nails , and would no doubt be hard as nails if you went up against him
1	do you remember our sweet life ,
1	he was cute , effeminate , graceful , wiry , lethargic , cruel
1	he was white , though dripping with sweat
1	if we want fighters , we have to create them
1	that ’ s the fault of voltaire ,
1	in the light they threw out , he could make out the shape of the carriage
1	come and have a drink , he yelled , since i ’ m the one that ’ s paying !
1	and so it is a place blessed by god
1	marguerite stopped at the door , petrified by the sight of this overwhelming chaos , and cried out : lord !
1	utopia does battle as insurrection , the old military code in its fist ; it shoots down spies , it executes traitors , it does away with living beings and hurls them into unknown darkness
1	as soon as he clapped eyes on the sister , his first impulse was to withdraw
1	churning things over all the while , he whipped the horse , which was trotting along at a strong and steady pace that enabled them to make two and a half leagues an hour
1	the second rope whipped the dormer window
1	only his face could be made out , calm and grave , but strangely sad
1	i was in my mother ’ s arms
1	in the name of the king now means in the name of the revolution
1	since there were no ladders , the french used their fingernails to climb
1	you know , madame , i am peculiar , i have my whims
1	the next day , he did not leave his room
1	hence their falls from grace and the stones thrown at them
1	and then , we were frightened of being all alone at night
1	and then , how the hell does he do the rounds by post chaise in such mountainous terrain ?
1	the stable boy and the wheelwright answered at the same time , shaking their heads
1	from that moment on , mother plutarch watched a sombre veil come down over the old man ’ s candid face , and it never lifted again
1	since you were wounded , she has passed her time weeping and making lint
1	it ’ s forty sous for the likes of him , replied mother thénardier in the same tone
1	among these gardens and these hedges , he saw a little single-storey house with a light in the window
1	the sun was shining bright , we weren ’ t cold for once
1	woe betide the man who tries to force their hand !
1	well , then , combeferre went on , i ’ m going to tie my handkerchief to my walking stick and go out and negotiate with them by offering to swap their man for ours
1	there was some mysterious rehabilitation already at work there , and to all appearances , for a long time already , scruples had had this man under strict control
1	i want to know
1	there are moments when your brain is like a furnace burning in your skull
1	it migh t be appropriate at this juncture to remember joseph beuys whose work , silence , parallels , not to say echoes , edvard munch 's painting , the scream
1	to see a fissure in the immense blue of the firmament !
1	i am very grateful to you
1	vvithout harking back to jacques callot or even francisco de goya and 'the miseries of war ' of the napoleonic era , we might remember what picasso said when a german interrogated him in about his masterwork , guernica : ( that 's your doing , not mine !
1	the mountains , the sea , the forest , make men wild
1	the hateful maxim live off your enemy produced that leper that only strong discipline could cure
1	it was , i think , toward the end of his fourth year of captivity
1	the whole thing was cheerful as can be
1	this character , grave with an intense gravity that was practically a threat , was one of those people who worry the observer , even if you only catch sight of them for a few seconds
1	having been embarked with his company according to the requirements of the campaign in a barge , which went from genoa to who knows which little port on the coast , he fell into a hornets ’ nest of seven or eight english clippers
1	people shout at them : that pavement you ’ re ripping up is the road to hell
1	the fourth side is open
1	woman is perfidious and deviousnumber she hates the serpent out of professional rivalry
1	javert did not recognize jean valjean , who , as we say , did not look himself at the moment
1	my husband beats me
1	even now , so close to his end , he had preserved all the energy of health
1	he had known neither one nor the other and he had deliberately kept himself in the dark
1	summer , i salute you
1	you would have truly amazed them , a fortnight later , if you ’ d said they ’ d ever been friends ; they no longer had any reason to be
1	before i answer you , he said , i beg your pardon
1	but sad grownds of dress do not permit me , alas !
1	a year ago , you all went to hernaninumber i ask you , hernani !
1	what they called our infringements were actually our rights
1	you will recall all that has been said about the barricade put up on this spot and eclipsed , as it happens , by the barricade at saint-merry
1	the villa , built in stone in the mansart style , wainscoted and furnished in the watteaunumber style , all loose rocaille inside , all fuddy-duddy periwig outside , walled about with a triple hedge of flowers , had something discreet , tizzy , and solemn about it , as befits a passing fancy of love and of the bench
1	his face was an inexhaustible repertory of masks and he made grimaces more convulsive and more fantastic than the mouths that washing torn in a heavy wind makes
1	i wanted to see the swans eat the brioche , wailed the child
1	we say heat up the stew
1	the chinese , we have to say to our shame , got on to this before we did
1	he tried the porte cochère and could immediately tell that it had been boarded up on both sides
1	you are my darling cosette !
1	it arrives with its legion , superstitions , with its sword , despotism , with its banner , ignorance ; in a very short while it has won ten battles
1	on either side a double row of guards marched , looking pretty scruffy under tricorn hats like those worn by the soldiers of the directoire , stained , riddled with holes , dirty , decked out in the uniforms of the war disabled and the breeches of undertakers ’ assistants , half grey , half blue , practically in tatters , with red epaulets , yellow cross-belts , sheath knives , muskets , and clubs ; a ragtag lot of soldier-thugs
1	meanwhile aunt gillenormand , who was pretty good underneath it all in a crisis , wound up unearthing marius ’ s hideout
1	he ’ s the one who ’ s killed monsieur madeleine
1	the great mainspring of the red spectre is broken
1	you do not make literature out oj ' warm and fuz < ) j feelings , they say
1	he had simply come , had grabbed a corporal and four soldiers from the neighbouring police station
1	at others , anyone could walk in off the street and the room was so full , people were forced to stand
1	monsieur madeleine sat bolt upright in his chair
1	this was , perhaps , the one
1	he had painted it himself , for he could turn his hand to anything—badly
1	this has two results : the soil is impoverished and the water is contaminated
1	how can he not hit the roof ?
1	when you go up the rue saint-jacques , and cross over the barrière side and follow the old inner boulevard on the left for a while , you come to the rue de la santé , followed by la glacière and , shortly before you get to the little gobelins stream , you find a sort of field that is , in the whole , long , monotonous belt of the boulevards around paris , the only spot where ruisdaelnumber would be tempted to sit down
1	monseigneur , the man ’ s gone !
1	he had turned up for bed and board at jacquin labarre ’ s but labarre had refused to take him in
1	it ’ s legal and it ’ s nice
1	he had had great difficulty getting through
1	you ’ re coming with us
1	she found jean valjean handsome just as she found the dump nice
1	when the first six months were up , the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month and continued to send funds from month to month with fairly constant regularity
1	the poor , gathered together in front of the door and receiving a share of their purses , blessed them
1	i would not be if , through my fault , you had continued to esteem me ; now that you despise me , i am
1	the language employed on board ship , that admirable language of the sea , so perfect and so picturesque , spoken by jean bart , duquesne , suffren , and duperré , number and that blends with the whistling of the rigging , the noise of the bullhorns , the clang of the scuttling axes , with the rolling , with the wind , with the squalling , with the cannon , is one great heroic dazzling form of slang that is to the fierce unflinching slang of the underworld what the lion is to the jackal
1	second , you won ’ t try to find out anything more
1	did jean valjean , without knowing it , feel its pressure ?
1	the depth of subsidences varied , as well as their length and density , depending on how bad the quality of the subsoil was
1	but then again , they ’ re so stupid , it ’ d go over !
1	including the upper galleries , which it loathes
1	in this case , you die before the month is out
1	just as he was going upstairs , he saw on the other side of the boulevard , walking along by the deserted wall of the rue de la barrière-des-gobelins , jondrette wrapped up in the coat of the philanthropist , talking to one of those disturbing-looking men who are appropriately known as prowlers of the barrières ; rough men with ambiguous faces , given to dubious monologues and evil schemes , who routinely sleep during the day , from which you have to assume they work at night
1	whether you ’ re sardanapalus or vincent de paul , number it comes to the same old nientenumber that ’ s the real situation , if you want to know
1	such two-faced rogues exist
1	that about sums up the glory of greece
1	why hadn ’ t he even mentioned the thénardiers to her and , especially , the day he had run into éponine ?
1	it cut short that more often
1	he said to the postilion : keep up the pace and you get double the tip
1	so , as you can see , it was not for no reason that the passport described jean valjean as a very dangerous man
1	you ’ re taking your life in your hands
1	a lot of good it ’ s done being two old men if all we are is two old lunatics
1	and so the emblematic figure emerges not so much of marcel duchamp as charlie chaplin or bannard , pitiful painter par excellence , as was claude monet , that miracle-worker of a rising sun , which is not quite the same as the one rising over the laboratories of los alamos
1	the mirror reflected the writing
1	jean valjean planted a kiss on this forehead with its heavenly reflection
1	he kissed the hankie , inhaled its perfume , placed it over his heart , on his bare skin , during the day and slept with it under his lips at night
1	at that instant , the horse of a national guard lancer riding past came crashing down , gavroche laid his pistol on the ground and pulled the man up , then he helped pull up the horse
1	drag your yoke , there you go , you ’ re a beast of burden in the harness from hell !
1	were all of them actually dead ?
1	at times , he thought so , and he shuddered
1	how can i do that ?
1	and the world will let you fall and die because the world lets everything fall and die that is nothing but self-interest , everything that does not represent for mankind some virtue or idea
1	it was punchinello who hit the cat
1	two napoléons , that could come in handy
1	this respite was dragging on , a sign that the government was taking its time and gathering its forces
1	having an immense reserve of fury to vent and not knowing what to do with it , he continued to address his daughter coldly as vous for over three months
1	you can hardly see
1	mother thénardier went every so often to the other end of the room , where her man was , to soothe her soul , as she put it
1	he resumed : he lives in the marais , rue des filles-du-calvaire , with his grandfather—i forget the name
1	when thénardier had got his breath back , he trained his bloodshot eyes on monsieur leblanc and said to him in a tight , low voice : what have you got to say before we get to work on you ?
1	yet he had to look inside his conscience after such a series of shake-ups and give an account of himself
1	they ’ re in the way
1	she saw clearly and was never wrong about anything
1	a streak of daylight comes in around noon
1	nil sub sole novum , number as solomon says—nothing new under the sun ; amor omnibus idem , number says virgil—love is the same for all of us
1	as for himself , he thought the barricade was ripe for the taking , and since what is ripe must fall , he decided to have a go
1	alarming details made the rounds , ominous news was spread like wildfire
1	jean valjean leaned his elbow on the bedpost at the head of the bed , his forehead in his hand , and began to contemplate fantine , motionless and distended
1	he who knows the answer to that , sees the darkness as a whole
1	not bad just now
1	reverend mother , the lever ’ ll need to be at least six feet long
1	after that , nothing left for the poor
1	he felt as though he had just woken up from some strange sleep , to find himself sliding down a slope in the middle of the night , on his feet , shivering , scrabbling backward in vain , on the extreme brink of an abyss
1	it did not even occur to him to speak to her about the episode that night in the old gorbeau building , the thénardiers , the burn , or her father ’ s strange attitude and incredible escape
1	the cesspit had its christopher columbus
1	to everything that they suggested to him , gently but persistently , he would reply : what ’ s the use ?
1	the boy stood with his back to the sun , which shot through his hair , turning it to threads of spun gold and flushing the savage face of jean valjean with a blood-red glow
1	i ’ ll get down here , said the man
1	six months making seven sous a day !
1	he was a foster father to the poor
1	he had a small but well-stocked library
1	no way you can go any further
1	if he fired a shot , monsieur leblanc would be saved and thénardier sunk ; if he didn ’ t shoot , monsieur leblanc would be sacrificed and , who knows ?
1	he cast a glance at the bill and could not repress a start of surprise
1	while dreaming and while chattering away , while putting together little trousseaux and little layettes , while sewing little frocks , little bodices , and little tops , the little girl becomes a young girl , the young girl becomes a big girl , the big girl becomes a woman
1	in , larry rivers , the son of jewish immigrants and the same man who had demystified washington 's iconography , painted two quietly symbolic portraits of primo levi , the witness to the camps
1	when a sewer slumped under pressure from houses , the chaos occasionally translated at street level as a sort of sawtoothed split between paving stones ; this rent would snake all the way along the cracked vault and then , since the problem was visible , it could be promptly fixed
1	it 's a nice turn of phrase , but it needs to be completed
1	meanwhile , no halt , no hesitation , no pause in the grand forward march of minds
1	the officer théodule gillenormand , now captain , had come up from chartres , where he was in charge of the garrison , to attend the wedding of his cousin pontmercy
1	the old concierge who had served him was one of them
1	i civilized you , says the convent
1	i do have to laugh
1	by virtue of what right ?
1	the field of the lark
1	there are people who have nothing !
1	an hour later , when she was back in her room , she cried
1	knowing the peaceful and more than shy habits of the old churchwarden bookworm , and amazed to see him in the midst of all the mayhem , two feet from the cavalry charges , almost in the middle of a fusillade , bareheaded in the pouring rain and strolling among the bullets , he went over to him , and the twenty-five-year-old rioter and the octogenarian had exchanged this dialogue :
1	whatever you say , treasure
1	in his adolescence he had sported a jacket made of light wool fabric known as nain londrin , which he never tired of talking about , effusively
1	you ’ ve got your poor old mother
1	a worker was tying a broad-brimmed straw hat of mother hucheloup ’ s on his head with some string , for fear of sunstroke , he said
1	it was that dark moment when two clouds merge
1	just remember , you ’ ve got two hundred thousand francs on you
1	a wedding should be royal and fabulous ; it should take its ceremony for a stroll from the cathedral of rheims to the pagoda of chanteloupnumber i can ’ t stand a halfhearted wedding
1	after the work ’ s done , not a moment before
1	after studying the man for a moment , the way you would study a viper , the man of the house came back to the door and said : on your way
1	in short , reestablish social truth , give liberty back its throne , give the people back to the people , give man back his sovereignty , remove the purple from the head of france , restore reason and equity in all their fullness , suppress all forms of antagonism by restoring each person to themself , do away with the obstacle that royalty constitutes to vast universal harmony , put the human race on equal footing with the law—what cause could be more just and , consequently , what war greater ?
1	jean valjean , at that very moment , was in the grip of a frightening upheaval
1	social philosophy is essentially the science of peace
1	any other child would have started screaming ages before this
1	where are you off to , you fellows ?
1	he had erudition and wit , but he always misfired
1	he was wearing a crimson waistcoat and he was swearing like a trooper
1	the grandfather caused jean valjean to evaporate
1	he went to find gavroche , who had settled in to making cartridges in the downstairs room by the dubious light of two candles , placed on the bar out of harm ’ s way as a precaution due to the powder spread over the tables
1	every time the clock struck , fantine pushed herself up and looked toward the door , then fell back again
1	just tie the rope to the wall
1	her stock of wedding presents appeared to her held aloft by seraphim
1	even though the season was fairly advanced , there were still a few late-blooming flowers here and there in the hedges , and as he walked along , clouds of perfume brought back childhood memories
1	the dining room doubled as an antechamber and divided the two bedrooms
1	would you like me to carry your box ?
1	we wouldn ’ t even have muzzled you
1	he did not know what had become of cosette ; the whole business of the rue de la chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory ; almost indistinct shadows flitted through his mind , éponine , gavroche , mabeuf , the thénardiers , all his friends grimly mixed up with the smoke of the barricade ; the strange cameo rôle of monsieur fauchelevent in that gory episode struck him as a riddle in a tempest ; he did not understand a thing about his own life , he did not know how or through whom he had been saved and no one around him knew , either ; all they had been able to tell him was that he had been brought back to the rue des filles-du-calvaire at night in a fiacre ; past , present , future , everything inside him was now no more than the fog of a vague idea , but in this mist there was one fixed point , a clear and precise outline , something carved in stone , a resolution , a desire : to find cosette again
1	the burial of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar , the removal of cosette , the smuggling of jean valjean into the room of the dead—all had gone smoothly and without a snag
1	the old woman was in the room doing the cleaning
1	he was surrounded on all sides by empty space
1	what it is to have met a churchwarden
1	civilized peoples , especially in our day , are not raised up or brought down by the good or bad luck of a captain
1	at that instant something occurred to him for the first time and he found it odd that he hadn ’ t thought of it before : that it was perhaps pointless , all this trouble he was going to ; that he didn ’ t even know what time the trial was on ; that he might , at least , have found out about that ; that it was mad to go on like this without knowing if it would serve any purpose
1	who has not felt all these things ?
1	yet , whatever the contrast , all these workers , from the uppermost to the most nocturnal , from the wisest to the most unhinged , have one thing in common and it is this : disinterestedness
1	well , what of it ?
1	mix two unhappy people together and you get happiness
1	marius left the house
1	he didn ’ t have an inkling of their address
1	he had been walking for about half an hour , at least according to his inner reckoning , and had not yet thought about resting
1	it was obvious that thénardier was avoiding naming the young girl in question
1	the left downstroke of the letter a is the road from nivelles , the right downstroke is the road from genappe , and the horizontal stroke is the sunken road from ohain to braine-l ’ alleud
1	he has horrible teeth because he is malnourished and his stomach suffers , but he has beautiful eyes because he has wit
1	after dinner , he would chat for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire before returning to his room and writing a bit more , sometimes on loose sheets of paper , sometimes in the margins of one of his folios
1	it was sister simplice
1	these gifts of a world to civilization are such increments of light that any resistance to them is criminal
1	this vessel , disabled as it was , for the sea had treated it badly , made quite an impression when it limped into harbour
1	her whole body trembled as if from some indescribable deployment of wings ready to fan out and carry her away , which you could feel quivering , but which you could not see
1	the redoubt in the rue de la chanvrerie , we repeat , seemed incredibly calm inside
1	and so he possessed her every dream , too
1	cosette ran off with her bucket as fast as her legs would carry her
1	and this , due to javert !
1	just then , an unbelievable and marvellous stroke of luck , marius saw a cab for hire going past on the boulevard , empty
1	there was a sort of cloudy swirling in his brain
1	we still have the indigo !
1	each of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible according to his nature
1	it created a real scandal
1	neither this note nor the medallion could ever be found
1	the stars are like little paper lanterns all lit up , you ’ d say they were smoking and that the wind then snuffs them out , it gives me the shivers , as if i had horses breathing in my ear all of a sudden
1	let ’ s see , if i don ’ t give myself up ?
1	you feel that it will never end
1	cosette and marius shuddered
1	too much zeal kills the grace and joy of a fine meal
1	indeed , a new character had just entered the stage
1	as for myself , forced to do what i did , but abhorring it , i have judged myself as well and you will soon see what i have sentenced myself to
1	he went over to the bed where she was sleeping and he trembled with joy ; he felt the pangs of a mother and he did not know what they were ; for it is so extremely obscure and so extremely sweet , this grand and strange lurch of the heart when it begins to love
1	they let me go !
1	it had gone white in the hour he had been there
1	between the two of them , they ’ ll put fear into the place
1	the racket brought all the officers running out of the café ; passersby gathered , and a great circle , laughing , jeering , and clapping , formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings hard to recognize as a man and a woman , the man thrashing around , his hat on the ground , the woman kicking and punching and screaming , bareheaded , toothless and hairless and livid with rage , truly horrible
1	a bit below the point where the horizontal stroke of the a meets and divides the right downstroke is la haie-sainte
1	the care he had himself taken to get her to let go of him was doing its work on her
1	but what wo not he forget ?
1	naturally , each one had his mistress
1	this one played the good apostle when he first turned up
1	in her youth , smack bang in the middle of ’ number , she had married a monk who ’ d escaped from the cloister in a red cap and switched from the bernardins to the jacobinsnumber dried-up , bitter , cantankerous , shrill , prickly , virtually poisonous , she lived off memories of her monk , who was now dead , and who had ruled her with an iron fist and broken her
1	the name mondétour wonderfully conjures up the way the whole of this road network snaked around
1	the first deep rumble of war stirred in her
1	the quai was deserted
1	since they ’ ve got their money
1	this substitution of a half-throne for a full throne was the work of number
1	what were these words ?
1	you remember her fluffy blue hat
1	he took advantage of their indecision ; time lost for them , time gained for him
1	thoughtful people rarely use the terms , the happy and the unhappy
1	he was bareheaded , sitting on his doorstep
1	gavroche had taken a bottle carrier from the tavern , had gone out through the exit , and was busy quietly emptying into his carrier the full cartridge pouches of the national guards who had been killed on the talus of the redoubt
1	he was full of sly caution and clumsy recklessness
1	what was bizarre was the way their roles seemed to be reversed now
1	much later , at the end of the century , action and reaction sini- larly would be put into instant interaction thanks to the feats of 'tele-action ' , this time , and not just radiophonic 'tele-listening ' or 'tele-vision '
1	he was in that place , the last phase of desolation , where sorrow no longer flows down like a fountain ; it has , so to speak , coagulated ; the soul is blocked by a sort of clot of despair
1	jean valjean , who had reloaded his gun , aimed at the newcomer and sent the officer ’ s helmet flying off to join the soldier ’ s
1	i go along with the pastoral and with the fairyland enchantment of marble and gold , too
1	provided , of course , that we separate the power of fiction from the mere construction of the anecdote portraying individual loves and sorrows against a backdrop of collective grand passions and grand catastrophes
1	the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other , even though the street was very short
1	jean valjean , on the other hand , was in the shadow , his iron spike in hand , standing erect , rigid , terrified at this luminous old man
1	everyone there was buzzing with it , to borrow the very expression of one of those taking part
1	of the young lady !
1	she was called whatever the first person who had happened along felt like calling her when they ran across her as a tiny toddler padding around the streets barefoot
1	within humanity , he chose france ; within the nation , he chose the people ; within the people , he chose women
1	go and get yourself hanged somewhere else !
1	once , in the moonlight , cosette had bent down to pick something up off the ground , and her bodice gaped open to reveal a glimpse of her cleavage ; marius averted his eyes
1	give him a chunk of wall , and with the tension of his back and his knees , with his elbows and heels jammed into the rough edges of the stone , he would hoist himself up three stories , as though by magic
1	now , no death , that of the body as late as possible , that of the soul never—that is what we would like
1	suddenly he had a jolt
1	actually he no longer had views as such , he had sympathies
1	in other words , they were subjects not of saint bernard but of saint benedict
1	the old man bored the lancer and the lancer disgusted the old man
1	a fat marmot , flanked by white partridges and grouse , was turning on a long spit in front of the fire ; on the stoves were two huge carp from the lac de lauzet and a trout from the lac d ’ alloz
1	if he were the only one who had been in the wrong in his fateful story ?
1	the bishop had had all the locks and bolts removed and now , night and day , this door was closed only by a latch
1	it ’ s today that paris is pantinnumber
1	he was a tall man , half peasant , half artisan
1	basque said again , giving himself his second ah !
1	was this because of cosette ?
1	you might go so far as to say that catastrophe came to napoléon from that shake of a peasant ’ s head
1	they eat it , that ’ s what they do with it !
1	the other armchair remained empty
1	cochepaille rolled up his sleeve , as all eyes around him were riveted to his bare arm
1	the girl was back in a flash
1	a rout is the worst kind of mêlée ; friends kill each other in their bid to get away , squadrons and battalions smash and send each other flying , sending up a sea foam of battle
1	she was modesty taken to a bleak extreme
1	the new tenant had ordered a few repairs , added what was missing here and there , replaced some cobblestones in the courtyard , some bricks on the floor , some steps on the stairs , some strips of wood in the parquet floor and panes of glass in the casement windows , and had finally moved in with a young girl and an old servant , noiselessly , more like someone stealing in than a man entering his own home
1	the prioress is expecting you
1	the few bourgeois who still ventured into the rue saint-denis at that point in the riot shot a glance down the rue de la chanvrerie , saw the barricade , and stepped lively on their way
1	today , they ’ re so serious
1	the smaller boy huddled close to his brother and said in a little voice : it ’ s dark
1	but you have to tell me !
1	you ’ ll go in at twenty and you ’ ll come out at fifty !
1	i ’ ll be happy with a thousand écus
1	monsieur le maire , do you think she ’ s pretty ?
1	the croaking would be more or less the same
1	they were coming to the village
1	a certain alertness was beginning to rouse the squad , and heads were lifting from off camp beds
1	then he crossed the room with steady tread and went and planted himself beside enjolras in front of the raised guns
1	like those membranes that flare up in certain inflammations and spread through the human body , the network of secret societies began to spread throughout the country
1	to have a decent room !
1	\t\tith architecture , alas , the jig is already up
1	that ’ s the duty i carried out in relation to cosette
1	he looked utterly distraught
1	a cold wind blew off the plain
1	there is the shameful holocaust denial that says that it simply did not take place
1	the fact is that the contents of the epistle had glanced off marius
1	the laws of septembernumber are as clear as day
1	the burgher of six was holding a big brioche
1	we have confidence in you
1	he had given up that refuge
1	master bourgaillard , the wheelwright , was standing on his doorstep
1	at that moment the crowd broke into applause ; hardened galley-wardens wept , women hugged each other along the quai , and everyone could be heard shouting in a sort of softened fury : give this man a pardon !
1	being sucked down is the sepulchre turned into the watery grave of a tide rising up from the ends of the earth to attack the living
1	i dressed like a turk of the levantine levant , he would say
1	trembling with joy , he showed the letter to old mother plutarch
1	geniuses blaze away there , red tails prosper
1	someone was indeed behind him , just as there had been a moment ago
1	he put out beaters , as hunters say , and sent one of his men to run round by a detour to guard this exit
1	me , i ’ ll keep an eye on her for you to make sure she doesn ’ t run away
1	a squadron of magnificent gardes du corps , bugler at the head , was passing down the avenue de neuilly ; the white flag , faintly pink in the setting sun , floated over the dome of the tuileriesnumber the place de la concorde , by that time once more the place louis xv , number was crawling with happy strollers
1	which they then injected into the developing wings of a chicken embryo to test the function of the gene
1	they stopped in the middle of the square and formed a huddle as though conferring together
1	four new travellers had turned up
1	some time passed in this way
1	a wigmaker ’ s just indignation
1	the man went on : isn ’ t there some kind of servant at madame thénardier ’ s ?
1	from the depths of this bier he had been able to follow and was following all the phases of the formidable drama that he was playing with death
1	the nook was quite simply the space beneath the stairs
1	on june number , number , at around eleven o ’ clock in the morning , solitary and empty of people , the luxembourg was lovely
1	javert owed the position he occupied to the protection of monsieur chabouillet , the secretary of the minister of state , comte anglès , then prefect of police in paris
1	they would swap caesar for prusias , and napoléon for the king of yvetotnumber—what a good little king he was !
1	the emperor gave him the cross
1	this was accompanied by all kinds of sharp little cries
1	were stewed like two grubs ;
1	i tread very softly so you won ’ t hear me , for you would perhaps be frightened
1	the corpses removed from the barricade made a terrible mound a few feet away
1	i ’ ll find out which parish this particular parishioner hails from
1	this is the sticks , here
1	louis xiv , to go no further back in time , wanted to build a naval fleetnumber for very good reason—nothing wrong with the idea
1	scarcely had he said those words full of peace than suddenly and without any transition , he made a strange movement that would have chilled the two saintly women to the bone with horror if they had witnessed it
1	meanwhile madame magloire had served supper
1	it ends in one of two holes , suicide or crime
1	what ’ s the meaning of this ?
1	and so he held tenure in good faith
1	after locating a gene that seemed to play a decisive role in the formation of a chicken 's hindlimbs , logan and tabin took the radical step of introducing the gene into the genome of a virus
1	we forgot to say that on the boulevard du temple , the boy was known as petit-gavroche
1	they see something other than themselves
1	you only have to hear them utter a word or see them make a move and you get a glimpse of the dark secrets in their past and the dark mysteries in their future
1	the impression that he had earlier had falling from the street into the convent came back to him
1	nonetheless , apart from the man ’ s identity , which he could not quite put his finger on , boulatruelle made some connections and calculations
1	god is a monstrous bit of balderdash
1	we are absolutely determined to be deliriously happy
1	i need to talk to you
1	the bride and groom disappeared
1	this strange battle was like a duel between two determined wounded men who , both fighting and fending off all the while , lose all their blood
1	he had a square face , with a thin mouth and strong , wild , bushy greying sideburns and a gaze that could turn your pockets inside out
1	she is , no doubt , with that poor woman
1	he watched the girl with a feeling of well-being
1	cried a voice from the door
1	it ’ s breaking my ribs !
1	tell me what it is
1	gavroche looked with satisfaction at the cover
1	and how much might this pair of stockings be worth , when they ’ re done ?
1	javert had never seen the unknown except down below
1	the doctors of the middle ages who , to say carrot , radish , and turnip , said : opoponach , perfroschinum , reptitalmus , dracatholicum angelorum , post-megorem , were talking slang
1	a stone , what for ?
1	he had to get through it
1	or else he examined the ceiling
1	marriage is like a grafted plant ; it either takes well or not at all ; shun the risk
1	he had made a second mistake , not staying in the luxembourg when monsieur leblanc came there on his own
1	but having said that , it is of course essential that the little people , the barefoot tramps , the small-timers , all those poor bastards , be given a few fables to swallow , chimeras , the soul , immortality , heaven , the stars
1	sometimes the people twist fidelity to themselves
1	towed along , it towed in turn
1	her great big eyes , set deep in a sort of shadow , were almost lifeless because of all the crying they had done
1	crossed arms are at work , joined hands are doing something
1	a tiny kitten was playing under the chairs
1	yes , answered the doctor
1	but , we have to say , this is just a start
1	he stopped , and said to her gently : all right , i won ’ t come any closer , but there ’ s no need to shout
1	i ’ m well aware there ’ s a chapel set apart in church and there ’ s a lot of hot air about the sorority of the virgin ; number but , heavens above , a pretty husband , a brave boy , and , after a year , a big blond nipper that sucks heartily on your nipples , one with nice rolls of fat on his thighs , that gropes and grabs fistfuls of your breast with his little pink paws , laughing like the dawn—surely that ’ s better than holding a candle at vespers and singing turris eburnea ! number
1	there he was on the street with his wife and kids without a scrap of bread
1	philosophy after a drink or two
1	we could almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet
1	you could sense the statue beneath the ribbons and glad rags , and in this statue , a soul
1	they said to him
1	the bernardine-benedictines of this order abstain from meat all year round , fast during lent and on plenty of other days that have special meaning for them , get up out of their first sleep to say the breviary and chant matins from one o ’ clock till three o ’ clock in the morning , sleep in serge sheets and on beds of straw whatever the season , do not have baths , never light fires , scourge themselves every friday , observe the rule of silence , only talking to each other during recreation periods , which are extremely short , and wear hair shirts for six months of the year , from september number , which is the exaltation of the holy cross , to easter
1	fauchelevent answered : everyone in the family is
1	but in this light , jondrette looked more like a demon than a blacksmith
1	we do not think so
1	on top of that , laigle de meaux , that baldy , hurts my eyes
1	he took a scourge and scoured the temple
1	a severe façade dominated this doorway ; a wall perpendicular to the façade came right up to the door , almost touching it , and flanked it with an abrupt right angle
1	you ’ ll say to me : what !
1	those who have never been through the whirlwind of this kind of war can ’ t begin to imagine the strange moments of tranquillity that are part and parcel of the convulsions
1	what are called honours and dignities , and even real honour and dignity , are generally fake gold
1	she had the courage she needed , and bore up bravely
1	tall municipal guards were coming in , some by leaping over the omnibus , the others via the opening , driving before them the gamin who fell back but did not run away
1	i don ’ t want to play any dirty tricks on you
1	the nuns were in raptures having her there
1	you are part of us
1	he could now see without being seen
1	before we go any further , and in the interests of being fully understood , we must insist on an essential observation
1	i won ’ t mention the holes you ’ ll have to cover up , the stones you ’ ll have to take out and put back twenty times a day , the rubble you ’ ll have to hide in your straw pallet
1	there are places that have a calming effect that works more or less mechanically on the mind
1	since the fever and delirium had left him , he no longer uttered that name , and a person could be forgiven for thinking that he no longer thought about her
1	comte beugnotnumber was received there as a matter of good manners
1	a man went into a cabaret , had a drink , and went out again , saying : wine seller , what is owing will be paid by the revolution
1	this illusion , which he would shake his head at a moment later , still managed to cast a ray of light into his soul that sometimes resembled hope
1	at certain moments , you lose your footing ; at other times , the ground gives way
1	who was this old man ?
1	he heard the high , hard voice of jondrette utter these words full of strangely intense interest for him : i tell you i ’ m sure of it
1	perhaps monsieur fauchelevent was a republican
1	when you support your nearest and dearest through your labour , you no longer have the right to sacrifice yourself
1	at the hour that jangles , the innkeeper isn ’ t worth a bent sou !
1	a harmless old fellow !
1	he murmured : the proof that god is good , is that she is here
1	no one would have me
1	europe has samples from asia and africa , but in a smaller format
1	meanwhile , the third man piped up : what ’ s the hurry ?
1	we ’ re not letting go of that kid
1	hence the heads bowed in horror ; hence all those great souls yielding up their swords
1	thénardier recognized him and that was all he needed : he understood
1	how does he look ?
1	before the presiding judge and the counsel for the prosecution could say a word , before the gendarmes and the ushers could make a move , the man everyone still called monsieur madeleine at the time had advanced toward the witnesses cochepaille , brevet , and chenildieu
1	as soon as he recognized jean valjean , the fearsome convict , beyond a doubt , he remembered that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements from the prefect of police in the rue de pontoise
1	no other man , apart from the police doctor , can go into the room of the dead
1	get ready to work
1	down with the tyrant !
1	you don ’ t remember anymore
1	are you what is known as a lucky man ?
1	jean valjean felt himself caught in a net that was slowly tightening
1	in the small world of digne , g—— the conventionist was spoken of in the hushed tones of horror
1	there are no secrets in my woods without me sticking my nose in
1	my father was a porter at the prytanéenumber he intended me for literature
1	talk about sumptuousness and splendour !
1	there was too much ignorance in jean valjean for him not to remain fairly unclear , even after so much misery
1	i tore up the altar cloth , it ’ s true , but only to bandage the wounds of my homeland
1	on top of this , as it always seeks to conceal itself , as soon as it feels understood it transforms itself
1	at the bottom of this chasm they could see a sentry ’ s fusil gleaming in the darkness
1	in that heart where there once was a wound , was now a scar
1	he was careful to stick to the dark side of the street at all times
1	the scaffold is not a framework , the scaffold is not a machine , the scaffold is not some inert mechanism made of wood , iron , and rope
1	let ’ s stop there for a moment
1	you ’ re strong and fit
1	for marius , monsieur fauchelevent was the condition on which he saw cosette
1	it was all organized like a conspiracy ; they stepped out before first light , and this made it all the merrier for cosette
1	jean valjean went over to him and placed his usual alms in his hand
1	there were no stars in the sky
1	indeed , coughing fits were interrupting fantine at very nearly every word
1	bonsoir , monsieur marius , she said suddenly , brusquely , then turned and left
1	up to that point , it wasn ’ t much more than petty larceny—a matter for the magistrate
1	fantine , as we will see , was fiercely courageous in the face of life
1	between one popular movement and another popular movement , we make a distinction
1	to be useless , that is , noxious !
1	you can see reddish gleams in the corners
1	in three of them , madame magloire grew vegetables ; in the fourth , the bishop had planted flowers
1	this one had not only grown , she had been perfected
1	above its shadow sat the open sky
1	marius haggard , javert laconic
1	was it a drunken orgy ?
1	it seemed to her that if she touched the doll , thunder would roll out of it
1	i asked my brother for the information you requested concerning the faux family
1	to do anything else struck him as positively dimwitted
1	his whole face was luminous with a vague expression of contentment , hope , and bliss
1	little by little , the old man stopped going as far as the corner of the rue des filles-du-calvaire ; he would stop halfway down the rue saint-louis ; sometimes a bit farther away , sometimes a bit closer
1	misery of my life , he ’ s dead !
1	the thénardier dive was like a web in which cosette was caught , trembling
1	it is to this end that philosophy and progress tend , through all their organs at once , through the improvement of the real as well as contemplation of the absolute
1	he gazed endlessly at the tiny hairs on the back of her neck , which he sometimes brushed with his breath , and he told himself that there was not one of those tiny hairs that did not belong to him , marius
1	there is not enough crueltyl , the rest is history
1	this head spoke to you but did not look at you and never smiled at you
1	for although she was very old , she still played the harp and very well at that
1	if infinity had no self , the self would be its limit ; it would not be infinite
1	he did not know where he was
1	jondrette marked each stroke with a nod of the head
1	she ’ ll soon be three
1	there was a hole in the top of his cage and , above that , another hole in the roof
1	and a very good man he is , too ; he does a lot for the less fortunate , even though he ’ s not rich himself
1	the kid as the enemy of the enlightenment
1	i ’ ll pop in and check on them from time to time
1	my dear brother , did you hear what madame magloire was saying ?
1	you see , she ’ s like our child
1	round about the time that monsieur madeleine normally came home , the good old caretaker automatically rose , took the key to monsieur madeleine ’ s room out of a drawer along with the candlestick he always used to mount the stairs to his room ; then she hung the key from the nail where he would normally get it and placed the candlestick to one side , as though she were waiting for him
1	no one in the garden ; no one in the house
1	the poor , as well as the good lord , benefited from the man ’ s fears , for the honourable deputy also funded two beds at the hospital—which made twelve new beds in all
1	in this prison in arras there ’ s an old ex-con named brevet who ’ s being held for i don ’ t know what reason and who has been made a gatekeeper at the barracks for good behaviour
1	on one side , saint benedict , on the other , the other inspector from the department of roads !
1	had the action begun two hours earlier , it would have been over by four , and blücher would have fallen in the battle won by napoléon
1	he had been arrested in possession of said branch ( which the lawyer happily dubbed a bough ) ; but he claimed to have found it on the ground and to have picked it up
1	a man killed in the rue du ponceau was rumbled and found to have a map of paris on him
1	the old woman stood straighter , choking with indignation , and the red glare of the lantern brightly lit her livid face , bringing out all the hollows and sharp angles and lines and crow ’ s-feet that ran all the way down to the corners of her mouth
1	when he was on top of the last step , when this trembling and terrible phantom , standing on that mound of debris before twelve hundred invisible guns , straightened up , in the face of death and as though he were stronger than it , the whole barricade took on a supernatural and colossal look in the darkness
1	he did what he could
1	is in my eyes
1	( we have indicated toussaint ’ s stutter once and for all
1	i ’ m not happy with you , answered the concierge
1	who knows whether the sun isn ’ t a blind man ?
1	the church received light from the garden
1	architectonics has become an audio-visual art , the only question now being whether it will shortly go on to become a virtual art
1	no monsieur fabre , rue saint-dominique !
1	when he got as far as the porte cochère , monsieur leblanc let his daughter pass ahead of him , then he stopped , turned round , and glared at marius
1	the prowler pretended to do what he was told and said : there ’ s nothing there
1	besides , what people call much too harshly , in certain cases , the ingratitude of children is not always as reprehensible as you might think
1	if that ’ s the case , the sergeant said , can we let him go ?
1	after looking up in the air , gavroche looked down at the ground ; he stood on tiptoes and groped around the doors and windows of the ground floors ; they were all shut , locked and bolted
1	in number , it was all the rage to bury the heads of little boys from four to six years old under enormous tanned leather caps with earflaps , which looked rather like eskimo cowls
1	the postal service between arras and montreuil-sur-mer was still conducted at that time by little mail coaches dating from the days of the empire
1	when he raised his eyes , combeferre was no longer there
1	this was , indeed , gavroche ’ s home
1	you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here
1	i wouldn ’ t think twice , you mongrel !
1	as he made his cassocks last a very long time , number but didn ’ t want anyone to know this , he never went to town without his padded purple overcoat
1	would you like some english ?
1	which perhaps proves boulatruelle ’ s intelligence
1	all that he possessed of passion and affection sprang to life and rushed toward that child
1	it ’ s quite a hand to play
1	three of the bare-armed men jondrette had described as chimney specialists had delved into the pile of scrap iron , one extracting some very large shears , another a pair of weighing tongs , the third a hammer , and they had then ranged themselves across the doorway without a word
1	he seemed to be waiting for a bullet to come and save him the trouble of waking up
1	the night breeze was up , which indicated that it had to be between one and two in the morning
1	we find a heap of tiny seeds in them and we haven ’ t got time to amuse ourselves picking ’ em out , so of course we have to let ’ em go under the millstones ; there ’ s rye grass , there ’ s alfalfa , corn cockle , common vetch , hempseed , foxtail , love-lies-bleeding , and a lot of other stuff , not counting the pebbles that collect in certain types of wheat , especially in breton wheat
1	at the same time , he felt something like remorse and he despised himself for acting this way
1	packs chose leaders for themselves ; one man , armed with a perfectly visible pair of pistols , seemed to be passing others in review as the files moved out of the way in front of him
1	he was absolutely consistent and could brook no objection , no exception
1	talking all the while , he pulled the cover up over the tiny one who murmured : oh , that ’ s nice !
1	you tell me you ’ re the bishop but that doesn ’ t tell me anything about what sort of man you are
1	he filled the air , being everywhere at once
1	it is not for you that he has come
1	at that the old galley slave would smile with the thoughtful smile of the angels
1	wanting to remain in mourning at all times , he clothed himself in night
1	either he ’ ll be plastered or he won ’ t be plastered—it ’ s all the same
1	just a bit farther on you come to that fateful street , the rue croulebarbe , where ulbach stabbed the girl from ivry who minded goats , as the thunder roared , just like in a melodrama
1	where does that come from ?
1	to have your dreams come true
1	there were now four of them ; all tall , decked out in long brown redingotes with round hats and carrying big truncheons
1	he was still living with mademoiselle gillenormand at no
1	well , can you do it ?
1	there , between the pont notre-dame and the pont-au-change , on the one hand , and between the quai de la mégisserie and the quai aux fleurs , on the other , the seine forms a sort of squared-off lake crossed by a rapid
1	o , transfigurations of love !
1	of all the rotten luck !
1	too bad is soon said
1	this quarter-acre patch of ground , so sparsely planted , so crowded with sheds and shacks , was dear to him , was all he needed
1	u og a fe
1	fauchelevent went on : how in chri—stmas are you going to get out of here ?
1	in the end , well , now i see her every day , at her place , her father doesn ’ t know , imagine , they are about to go away , we see each other in the garden in the evening , her father wants to take her away to england , so i said to myself : i ’ ll go and see my grandfather and tell him all about it
1	this initial danger was over , but he still felt a dreadful turmoil inside
1	a cord attached to a bell hung to the right of the grate
1	knowing that she was beautiful , cosette lost the grace that goes with ignorance ; an exquisite grace , for beauty enhanced by artlessness is ineffable and nothing is as adorable as the blossoming innocent who walks along holding the key to paradise in her hand without knowing it
1	he ’ s in the coffin
1	that ’ s where we come unstuck
1	but what a sheep !
1	you say rue plumet ?
1	it was one of those dead ends that the technical language terms a branch pipe
1	give us back our père de gandnumber
1	obviously she would have to get used to disrespect just as she had got used to poverty
1	marius himself took hold of the pistol that was in his right fob pocket , pulled it out and cocked it
1	round about the halfway mark , at the spot where it became a plain , where delord ’ s division had passed , the layer of dead men thinned out a bit
1	the bowels of the building consisted of a long corridor that opened , to left and right , onto apartments of various sizes , habitable at a pinch and closer to booths than prison cells
1	for the beautiful thing is that it is always for the ideal , and for the ideal alone , that those who do devote themselves devote themselves
1	we have no idea
1	this was the occasion for aunt gillenormand to have a second idea
1	the day after the execution and for many days following , the bishop seemed devastated
1	he didn ’ t seem to be in any hurry or in any agitation , and while he was wrapping up the bishop ’ s candlesticks , he munched on a lump of black bread
1	those tears were the son ’ s delay
1	all that had happened to him seemed absurd ; all that surrounded him did not seem possible
1	but she didn ’ t seem to hear him
1	and then i asked : why are you asking ?
1	it ’ s less dangerous to life and limb
1	this is just a detail
1	it ’ s on two trestles under a pall
1	they haven ’ t got a clue
1	you sometimes see people , poor and mean people , who seem to wake up out of destitution and suddenly hurtle headlong into wild extravagance ; they go on a spending spree and suddenly become stunning , lavish , resplendent
1	not that he ’ s prosaic , far from it ; but he swaps the solemn vision for comical fantasies
1	listen to the sort of praise a person heaps on their neighbour
1	it was the old quartier of the marché-aux-chevaux , the horse markets
1	you see , monsieur , she said , putting on her sweetest look , which was even more annoying to look at than her ferocious look , i don ’ t mind the child playing , i ’ m not against it—but just this once , because you ’ re generous
1	but you ’ ve come too early
1	the devil might pass through , but the good lord lives here
1	jean valjean was obliged to find , almost to invent , his route without seeing it
1	let ’ s think about what we ’ re saying if we want to sparkle
1	at the appointed hour she would run to the shed
1	he can read the soul of a policeman like an open book and will tell you frankly and without batting an eyelid : so-and-so is a traitor … so-and-so is a nasty piece of work … so-and-so is terrific … so-and-so is a joke—all these terms , traitor , nasty piece of work , terrific , a joke , have a specific , accepted meaning in his mouth
1	they ’ ve got pink tights that get all wrinkled , and you can see that their elbows are darned with white thread
1	jean valjean had turned his back to the door , no doubt as an added precaution
1	placed end to end , the three of them would not have come to more than six feet
1	the person answered : it ’ s the field of the lark
1	cosette told him what she thought she ’ d heard and seen
1	little as they are , they are all runaways from poor families
1	certain of man ’ s faculties are directed toward the unknown : thought , meditation , prayer
1	the past , it is true , is very strong at the point we have reached
1	this relentless persecution by fate had made him inventive
1	at the start , the insurrection is a riot , just as the river is a torrent
1	and i tell you , you are thénardier
1	in this way , he did himself more good than the devil did him harm
1	he said to himself : she is so beautiful !
1	it is thereby impossible to stop at these self-proclaimed solutions
1	he had climbed over the garden wall at the rue polonceau corner , the hymn of angels that he had heard in the middle of the night was the nuns singing matins ; the room he had glimpsed in the dark was the chapel ; the ghost he had seen stretched out on the ground was a sister making atonement ; the little bell whose ringing had so strangely startled him was the gardener ’ s bell tied around father fauchelevent ’ s knee
1	what do you want ?
1	suddenly he fished inside his redingote , took out his pocketbook , pulled out a pencil , ripped out a page , and swiftly wrote the following line : monsieur madeleine , mayor of montreuil-sur-mer
1	he did not go as far as the brahmans , number but he seemed to have taken these words of ecclesiastes to heart : who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ? number external ugliness or the deformities of instinct did not worry him or make him angry
1	you don ’ t have any room and it ’ s uncomfortable
1	what ’ s that to me ?
1	what was she doing ?
1	marius cocked his ear
1	jean valjean could breathe there
1	they passed the baker ’ s , but cosette forgot all about the bread she was supposed to bring back
1	bear in mind the confession of the german priest , father niemoller : 'when they arrested the gypsies , i said nothing
1	his head was on fire
1	you don ’ t want to be a working man , you will be a slave
1	here i am , all alone
1	we are all the same
1	the two new arrivals accordingly advanced somewhat tentatively , barely making out the dim shapes around them , while being seen and examined perfectly well by the garret residents , whose eyes were accustomed to this eternal twilight
1	gazing at the same planet in space or the same worm glistening in the grass ;
1	i wandered with you , squeezing your soft arm
1	we know very well that your souls are full of the joy and the glory of giving your lives for the great cause ; we know very well that you feel you ’ ve been handpicked to die usefully and magnificently and that each of you is clinging to his part in the triumph
1	what a joke that would be
1	every last one of them !
1	the abbess , a ghoul , sanctifies them and terrifies them
1	god has his instruments
1	you ’ re a wheelwright , aren ’ t you ?
1	some sort of would-be avant-garde art
1	his two mysteries , his two twin plots , one in league with the nuns , the other with monsieur madeleine , one for the convent , the other against , had succeeded together , one after the other
1	a three-day riot costs a hundred and twenty million ; in other words , looking only at the financial result , it is equivalent to a disaster , a shipwreck or battle lost , one that wipes out a fleet of sixty ships of the line
1	he shut his mouth and waited
1	it is meadows in flower , it is green grass , it is parsley , sage , marjoram , and thyme , it is wild game , it is cattle , it is the satisfied lowing of great bullocks at evening , it is fragrant hay , golden wheat , it is bread on your table , it is hot blood in your veins , health , joy , life
1	he called marius monsieur le baron
1	fauchelevent thought : i ’ m finished
1	the night of june number–number , he poked fun at wellington
1	he was the convict
1	at the order given by enjolras , he got to his feet
1	quiot shrinks back before vivian , kellermann before vandeleur , lobau before bülow , morand before pirch , domon and subervic before prince william of prussia
1	it has also , according to abel gance , stymied looking - before going on to render the visual arts hoarse and then swiftly dumb
1	it came back to jean valjean then
1	but my real name is euphrasie
1	the child was always hungry
1	the moment you least expect it , god plasters a meteor across the wall of the firmament
1	you ’ ve opened your eyes , you are looking at me , you are alive , thank you !
1	louis xvi was a mere king
1	he told himself that if he managed to get inside , he would perhaps be saved
1	chance is the scene-shifter in such conversations
1	in nussbaum 's prisoners in saint-cyprien , all the elements seem to have been brought together to create a meaningful scene
1	victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished
1	a little beyond the barricade , he thought he caught a glimpse of something white up ahead
1	in this conceptual environment , jean valjean looked disfigured and repulsive to him
1	instinct told him : run !
1	you were whispering it amongst yourselves
1	the counterfeits of the past assume false identities and happily call themselves the future
1	for its part , the fiacre , which mirrored all his movements , had come to a halt above him alongside the parapet
1	jean valjean did not know where he was going any more than cosette did
1	you stole alba , we are taking clusium
1	thénardier went over to the corner by the door , grabbed a bundle of ropes from the floor , and threw it to them
1	here , hold my hand
1	there is corruption under illustrious tyrants , but moral pestilence is more hideous still under infamous tyrants
1	year 's day , thoroughly convinced of the lethal character of the works of oskar kokoschka , emil nolde or the sculptor , lehmbruck , gimpel goes on to tell us that there never has been any such thing as old-master art or modern or contemporary art , but that the 'old master ' shaped us , whereas the 'contemporary ' artist shapes the perception of the next generation , to the point where no one is 'ahead of their titne for they are their time , each and every day '
1	there is something grand about making a serious mistake a duty
1	cenobitismnumber is a human problem
1	the cuirassiers annihilated seven out of thirteen squares , took or spiked sixty cannon pieces , and captured six colours from the english regiments , which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the guard brought to the emperor out in front of the farm at la belle-alliance
1	that yell put an end to the speech
1	there had been in the utterance of that repeated sentence the tone that distinguishes the question mark from the exclamation mark
1	put the fire out
1	no , you ’ ve got it mixed up !
1	he would have been sunk
1	with the indictment of silence , contemporary art ca not quite shake off the acccusation of passivity , indeed , of pointlessness the case instituted against silence , citing the evidence of the works , then ends in out and out condemnation of that profane piety that was still an extension of the piety of bygone sacred art
1	she got her breath back for a moment , lifted the handle again and started walking once more , this time for a little longer
1	all of a sudden , he stopped in his tracks
1	what is the world coming to ?
1	the flowers fell to the florists as of right
1	a trickle of light fell from the air vent through which he had slipped and his eyes adjusted to the vault
1	marius comes home these days at one in the morning !
1	everything then comes tumbling down
1	to fall for père duchesne , make eyes at the guillotine , sing romances and play the guitar under the balcony of ’ number , it ’ s enough to make you want to spit on all those young men , they are such dunderheads !
1	the ancients acted like the moderns
1	they could not hold out for a quarter of an hour in that grapeshot
1	the barber , in his shop heated by a good hot stove , was shaving a customer and throwing a look from time to time at this enemy , this cocky little kid frozen stiff , who may have had both hands in his pockets but had obviously unsheathed and sharpened his wits
1	anyone passing by , whatever the hour , had merely to push it open
1	he needs at least two days off
1	a streetlamp turned the rim of the quai red
1	i ’ ll pay the same price as a room
1	an honest man would have taken fright
1	to fail his father ’ s will … or let a crime go ahead !
1	monsieur , i beseech you , i entreat you , monsieur , give me your most sacred word , don ’ t tell her
1	this was a group of impatient types that broke away and hurtled ahead
1	in the other , the movement of his hand unfurls the camps ' landscape of walls and victims ' silhouettes
1	apart from throwing himself in the seine , what was he going to do ?
1	my feet are cold , he said
1	he spent hours watching her dress and undress her doll and listening to her chirping away
1	the child was speechless
1	whatever your opinion , whether you are for the lean cock like the canton of uri , or for the fat cock like the canton of glaris , number it matters little , so drink
1	the gravedigger sent the fourth shovelful into the grave
1	dirt is the same thing as man
1	how do you get in ?
1	it is a strange thing , you know ?
1	marius looks to be dead to one who knows
1	some little time after the events we have just related , old boulatruelle experienced a strong emotion
1	later , number showed how towns can get some sense into them
1	at six francs a shot , that means that nine hundred thousand francs a day , or three hundred million a year , goes up in smoke
1	the man ’ s examination was already over and the witness statements had been taken , too ; but still to come were the speech for the defence and the closing arguments of the public prosecutor ’ s department ; it would hardly be over before midnight
1	anyway , no one ’ s interested in taking a close look at kids who don ’ t have a single sou
1	it is hard to say what he was thinking , if anything , in taking them with him
1	all that time the clouds passed over their heads
1	suicides like the ones about to be committed here are sublime , but suicide is limited and won ’ t tolerate being extended ; the moment suicide hurts your nearest and dearest , it ’ s known as murder
1	suddenly thénardier saw something like hope flash before his eyes , for the men were talking slang
1	in the middle of winter !
1	because i ’ ve got something else to buy with it instead
1	lovers who are separated cheat absence by a thousand chimeras that , nonetheless , have their reality
1	a savoyard , you know ?
1	six strong horses pulled a coach
1	he thought how , if he had not handed over his five francs that morning to the jondrette girl , he would have followed monsieur leblanc ’ s cab and as a result been completely in the dark
1	the grand sewer , you must remember , is nothing more than the old ménilmontant stream and it ends , if you go up it , in a dead end—that is , in its old starting point , which was its spring , at the foot of the ménilmontant knoll
1	in the middle of a totally unpredictable political event that had taken off , under pressure of a possible revolution , without letting himself be distracted by mere insurrections and barricades , a policeman would tail a thief
1	she could not take her eyes off the fabulous boutique
1	when you consult the file of modern betrayals , that one appears at the top of the list
1	i owe the prefecture my day as a fishwife
1	i don ’ t want to get the wind up , i ’ m no chicken , that ’ s a known fact , but we can ’ t lounge around here all day—otherwise they ’ ll have our hides
1	it was the porter killed by le cabuc
1	the video installation already was to fernand leger 's mechanical ballet
1	jean valjean was a thoughtful man and a nocturnal wanderer , and he often came home quite late at night
1	the suffering in these lives , then , is not due to words whose pointlessness , as everyone knows , is equalled only by their splendour
1	i study your feet with a microscope and your soul with a telescope
1	but it happened that jean valjean sometimes caught sight of him
1	she began to sew heavy-duty shirts as piecework for the soldiers in the garrison and made twelve sous a daynumber her daughter cost her ten
1	the popular imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with an unspeakably hideous dose of the boundless
1	when marius became a lawyer , he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter that was cold but full of humility and respect
1	this sincerity of muck pleases us , and is restful for the soul
1	combeferre completed and corrected enjolras
1	but he wasn ’ t closing it , for god ’ s sake !
1	ah , yes , infantile drivel , needless repetition , laughing at nothing , useless information , inanities , all that is deepest and most sublime in this world !
1	he answered : yes , madame
1	he felt irresistibly that cosette was escaping him
1	babet had carried out his part of the business that same day , as we saw according to the story montparnasse told gavroche
1	a favourable circumstance that allowed marius not to lose any of this conversation was that the fallen snow muffled the noise of carriages on the boulevard
1	oh , at those times , what painful eyes he turned toward the cloister , that chaste summit , that dwelling place of angels , that inaccessible glacier of virtue !
1	out of an itching need to be able to tell
1	to eat , real meaning : to devour
1	but i can ’ t do that !
1	so , cinema is an art that is immediately ’ romantic
1	i put a cabriolet on him
1	love , you live in her ;
1	this explosion over , he added : welcome , little mites , this is my home
1	he flashed the switchblade that he held open up his sleeve in the light of the streetlamp
1	jean had no work
1	night had closed in
1	dupuytren and récamiernumber argued in the amphitheatre of the école de médecine and virtually came to blows over the divinity of jesus christ
1	when the hearse had driven away , when the priest and the choirboy had climbed back into the carriage and gone , fauchelevent , who didn ’ t take his eyes off the gravedigger , saw him bend down and grab hold of his shovel , which was sticking straight up in the pile of dirt
1	you ran your arms over your fine legs ,
1	had he become oblivious to danger , which is a serious thing in a general ?
1	i t will not be long before the drawings of kindergarten children are banned , replaced by digital calligraphic exercises
1	who knows if she wasn ’ t dreaming of him the way he dreamed of her ?
1	where today there is the great pyramid of earth surmounted by a lion , there was a ridge sloping down toward the nivelles road in a negotiable ramp ; but on the genappe roadway side , this ridge was almost an escarpment
1	for heaven ’ s sake , i must have been mad , i must have been completely brainsick , why on earth would i talk about giving myself up ?
1	he ’ s not from any of the villages around here , is he ?
1	he would say , let ’ s see how this sin came to pass
1	the man gave her back the bucket
1	after that momentary flash of light , complete extinction was achieved
1	nothing is too awful for her now
1	then marius added in a whisper as though to himself : he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received anyone except at night
1	that night , before going to bed , he went on to say , never be afraid of thieves and murderers
1	the father of a woman that we love is never a stranger for us
1	the thoughts cosette had , her tender preoccupations , the image of marius that filled her soul , in no way detracted from the incomparable purity of her beautiful chaste and smiling face
1	does it stop martin of toursnumber from being a saint and from having given half the coat off his back to a pauper ?
1	at first , before he had time to think , lost as he was , like a drowning man clutching at straws he had tried to find the child to give him back his money ; then , when he realized that this was pointless and impossible , he gave way to despair
1	how many times have we seen jean valjean seized in the dark in hand-to-hand combat by his conscience and fighting desperately against it !
1	fauchelevent ’ s wild eyes went automatically to this pocket and stayed there
1	at night , dripping with sweat , shattered by fatigue , the green cap over his eyes , to mount two by two , under the sergeant ’ s whip , the gangway of that floating prison !
1	it weighs down , it crushes
1	the inhabitant of the dungeon had this wet ground for a bed
1	it was our man and cosette
1	and it ’ s all going to send the prices up
1	since he ’ s a saint , would i save him ?
1	it was like an intuition ; he understood this with his clear and sagacious swiftness
1	one of us has to climb up , said montparnasse
1	let ’ s suppose that in all this there is a bad deed on my part and that my conscience holds it against me one day , all we have to do is accept , for the good of others , such disapprobation as burdens me alone , this bad deed that compromises my soul alone—that ’ s what devotion is , that ’ s where virtue lies
1	the monastic regime , good at the dawn of civilization , useful in reining in brutality through spirituality , is bad for the world in its maturity
1	better to suffer , to bleed , to weep , to tear your skin off your flesh with your nails , to spend your nights tossing and turning in anguish , to gnaw away at yourself , guts and soul
1	he passed , pacific and stern , between bare sabres
1	laigle ’ s coat was threadbare , but joly was dapper
1	it wouldn ’ t come to me at first
1	he would ’ ve had to talk then , and say where his daughter is , and say where the loot is !
1	jean valjean could see the way out
1	yet on the way back to the rue de babylone with cosette , jean valjean did not notice that she asked him other questions about what they had just seen ; maybe he was too absorbed in his own utter dejection to register what she said and to respond
1	the house in the rue plumet
1	little one , he said , what ’ s the matter ?
1	the streetlamp nearby lit up her face and her body
1	lynch law led to terrible blunders
1	there are some pretty low walls in this cul-de-sac enclosing gardens that end in a vast tract of uncultivated land at the back
1	there must be glimmers above houses like this one
1	everything trembled at the sound of her voice , the windows , the furniture , people
1	the setting up of philippe v in spainnumber cost france two billion
1	suddenly plato 's cave became the sybil 's lair and there was not a thing the visual arts could do about this sudden irruption of the audio-visible
1	you felt you were looking at mayhem petrified
1	marius answered , embarrassed : monsieur …
1	it stepped inside only very briefly to film fake workers , gangsters who had come to steal the workers ' pay
1	he stayed nailed to the spot , petrified , dumbstruck , wondering , through a confused and inexpressible anguish , what this sepulchral persecution meant and where the pandemonium that was hounding him came from
1	it was falling into decay
1	it ’ s like i ’ ve got feathers under my head
1	the taverner went over to him
1	none had shoes ; those who didn ’ t have socks were barefoot
1	this self below is the soul ; the self above is god
1	at the end of the bill thénardier had put : received in part payment three hundred francs
1	this was not true
1	where did he go ?
1	if you were here for good it would be a real burial
1	marius rolled this whole set of ideas around confusedly in his mind , going from one idea to the next and stirred by all of them
1	only one of her wooden clogs was lying next to the bed
1	let ’ s learn how to use this vast blaze of principles and virtues that crackles and flames out and occasionally sputters
1	but we will eat you !
1	all of a sudden a carrier ’ s cart , heavily loaded , rattled past on the boulevard and shook the old hovel like a roll of thunder , causing it to shudder from top to bottom
1	loved by cosette , he felt himself healed , rested , soothed , fulfilled , rewarded , crowned
1	that was the way he spoke
1	that cesspool offered its engulfment to the city and the world
1	this , said gavroche , is what summer nights are good for
1	fury had now turned to skill
1	now , thénardier pursued , sign
1	she waved him away , a superior dismissing an inferior
1	the identical nature of the concession that each makes to all is known as equality
1	this house has been torn down and rebuilt since and the number has probably changed in these numbering revolutions the streets of paris undergo
1	wherever there are fewer houses and fewer streets , the sewer has fewer air vents
1	the mass bristling with bayonets hurled themselves forward like gymnasts , irresistibly , and the dense battlefront of the attacking column appeared through the smoke at the top of the steep slope
1	the light from the air vent died out ten or twelve feet in front of jean valjean and barely cast a wan whiteness over a few metres of the damp sewer wall
1	he had not exactly voted for the death of the king , but as good as
1	good evening , pappy , yelped the daughters
1	suddenly she spotted the other two on their swing , stood stock-still and poked her tongue out , a sure sign of admiration
1	he gathered his books , checked them and put them in order
1	history is not done yet with turning itself into stories
1	do i have the right to undo the work of providence ?
1	when he reached the first floor , he paused
1	this was the only window in the house , so there was no neighbour ’ s gaze to fear , either to the side or directly opposite
1	he turns out to be ivan koslovsky , the russian tenor par excellence , a man who traversed the torments of the century imperturbably singing the muted melody of the indian merchant in sadko or lensky 's farewell lines in eugene onegin :
1	they threw bodies out the windows , some of them still alive
1	in montfermeil , if you know it
1	monsieur le comte , my eye !
1	but i won ’ t wait for the sentence , which is not in any doubt
1	happiness is only the bare necessity
1	damn if it isn ’ t real !
1	the bird sounds off in the bowers
1	oh , but don ’ t complain , you now share the lot of the chosen ones
1	in the middle of this silence , a hoarse voice threw in a grimly sarcastic remark from the hallway : if you need any wood chopped , don ’ t forget i ’ m here !
1	and we would add : there is , perhaps , no travail more useful
1	for we must flatter no one and nothing , not even a great people ; wherever nothing is lacking , ignominy sits next to sublimeness ; and if paris contains athens , the city of light , tyre , the city of power , sparta , the city of virtue , nineveh , the city of wonder , it also contains lutetia , number the city of slime
1	whatever you do , don ’ t open the door
1	a sacred horror perhaps , for , as we just pointed out , he sensed a quid divinumnumber in this man
1	it is up into this hold that this artful dodger piles
1	she was the object of the boarders ’ endless curiosity
1	the whispering of several men could be heard along with the protests of the caretaker in the corridor
1	he went away , crushed
1	a child ’ s voice said : de profundisnumber
1	waterloo is the only thing saving your hide !
1	what was amazing was that the police couldn ’ t lay their hands on any of them
1	jean valjean reappeared and cried out : done
1	he ’ s a stool pigeon
1	the old man said goodbye to the fauboug saint-germain and to the salon of madame de t—— and went and set up in the marais , in his house on the rue des filles-du-calvaire
1	there was someone there ; but that someone was not among those the human eye can see
1	that great need of mankind ’ s , the finite , which allows itself to be embraced , is something they know nothing about
1	he remembered his giddy exhilaration , his intoxication with cosette , how love absorbed everything , how they ’ d kidnapped each other and carried each other off into the ideal , and perhaps , also , as the imperceptible dose of reason mixed in with that violent and wonderful state of the soul , a vague and nameless instinct to hide and to wipe from his memory that fearful episode he did not want to go near , in which he did not want to play any kind of rôle , which he himself shunned and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without also being accuser
1	a subterranean edifice built together by all the miserable outcasts
1	sometimes he would allude to his ninety years and say : i do hope i won ’ t see ninety-three twice
1	in the broadest and most absolute sense of the words , you could say that , cut off from everything by tomb walls , jean valjean was a widower just as cosette was a little orphan girl
1	he rarely went to church , did not go hunting , and never went to the opera
1	yet there are theorists for those very theories
1	great combatants must rise up , illuminate nations by their audacity , and shake up this sad humanity that is covered in darkness by divine right , caesar-style glory , force , fanaticism , irresponsible power , and absolute majesty ; a throng busy gazing idiotically at these dismal triumphs of the night in all their crepuscular splendour
1	she ran into her father from time to time and he would say hello
1	besides , all the windows of this silent abode had thick iron bars on them , even the dormer windows in the roof
1	she asked toussaint : is my father back yet ?
1	having no reason to be on his guard , and actually thinking for the first time in his life , montparnasse didn ’ t feel a thing
1	moreover , fauchelevent was puzzled
1	just as birds will make a nest out of anything , children can make a doll out of anything at all
1	brutus strikes him with a knife , and god strikes him with a cometnumber hey presto !
1	thénardier , i ’ ve told you what your name is
1	jean valjean was crushed by this sadness and shattered by this softness
1	the rear courtyard was wrapped around by fairly high walls with only a few gardens beyond them for a vista
1	we ’ re at it too , good as
1	the counsel for the prosecution took the floor : gentlemen of the jury , this very strange and unexpected incident that has disturbed this hearing inspires in us , as in you , only a feeling we have no need to express
1	to hoodwink the police ?
1	ah , but you ’ re alive—that ’ s the best part about it !
1	he had something divine about him at that moment , a quality that forces the multitudes to draw back and make way before a man
1	you may well be a saint
1	'that is a terrible thing to say ' , j anouch said
1	disorder gets diminished and becomes inane
1	they ’ d have stuck me in bicêtre
1	this , we will try to do
1	the clusians are ours
1	several municipal guards , wounded in the rue des lombards , turned back
1	he turned to his daughter and said to her : nothing
1	those who had declared the newcomer an ambitious man eagerly seized the opportunity everyone longs for to say : there !
1	they stare at the dark , they get down on their knees and bring their hands together
1	the world is a great fat diamond !
1	armed men surged up at street corners and then vanished , shouting : go home !
1	she was definitely wondrously beautiful
1	enjolras gave him a disdainful glare : grantaire , you are not capable of believing , thinking , wanting , living , or dying
1	paris has an aesop and it is mayeux , and a canidia and it is mademoiselle lenormand , number the fortune-teller
1	dying is nothing , what is unbearable is dying without seeing her
1	in that sweet month of may , marius and cosette discovered what triggered even more immense happiness :
1	that way they had twelve hours of darkness ahead of them and they worked out how to put them to use
1	the sun has sneezed hummingbirds
1	one of its moans has come down to us : je n ’ entrave que le dail comment meck , le daron des orgues , peut atiger ses mômes et ses momignards et les lochre criblant sans être atigé lui-même—i can ’ t make head or tail of the fact that mack , the king of the heap , can knock his kids and his kids ’ kids around and cop them singing out without him being knocked around himself
1	only an artist could come up with a line like that
1	one of the defeated
1	the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other a hand
1	they ’ ll leave me alone
1	aunt gillenormand came and went , aghast , clutching her hands , unable to do anything but mutter : god , is it possible ?
1	the cannon spewed out its bundle of buckshot with a roar
1	there a fourth bullet also missed him
1	being the idiom of corruption , slang is corrupted fast
1	this cry , which was famous around number , was a strategic warning telegraphed from gamin to gamin ; it scans like lines of homer , with a notation almost as inexpressible as the eleusinian lamentations of the panathenaea , number and it brings the antique evoe to mind
1	the two little abandoned boys had almost got as far as the big pond , but they were a bit overwhelmed by all this light , and they tried to hide—an instinct of the poor and weak in the face of magnificence , even when impersonal ; they ducked behind the swans ’ shelter and stayed there
1	to suddenly see blossoming in the middle of all her misery the fruits of paradise !
1	set an example , for heaven ’ s sake !
1	you should sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece
1	the grandfather smiled his poor old smile for nothing
1	whether out of terror or out of courage , there had not been a peep from cosette
1	well now , you ’ ve been through a revolution since the last time i had the honour of seeing you
1	professed nuns also have a rosary at the side
1	the rue de la chanvrerie
1	a good old stick , one of the old school
1	yet her eyes danced all around her and she began to speak in a barely audible voice as though talking to herself : set me free !
1	what ’ re we coolin ’ our ’ eels in this ’ ole icigo for ?
1	in conversation , he was affable and cheery
1	without going further into issues that only indirectly touch on the subject of this book , we will simply say this : it would have been a good thing if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his gaze had not been turned for a single moment from that serene contemplation where we see , shining clearly above the stormy hustle and bustle of human affairs , those three pure lights , truth , justice , and charity
1	; she had swept her two children into her arms and swiftly taken refuge behind her husband , gazing at the stranger in horror , her throat bare , her eyes wild with fright , murmuring almost inaudibly in french alpine patois : tso-maraude—chat de maraude , or cat of a thief
1	that ’ s where marius is going , then ?
1	you ’ ll just have to wait
1	he took good care not to be useless ; having books did not stop him from reading , being a botanist did not stop him from being a gardener
1	i voted for the demise of that particular tyrant
1	i ’ ve made my choice
1	jean valjean had killed javert
1	i had myself wheeled outside so i could cast my eyes over everything one last time
1	there is the same promiscuity , only even more amazing , between things of the intellect and the facts of substance
1	your fairy princess , éponine , had a bit of a sniff around , babet went on
1	he felt safe and alone ; with the bolt in place , he felt impregnable
1	its gaiety is like lightning and its farce holds a sceptre
1	what does the trojan war turn on ?
1	look me in the face a little , why don ’ t you
1	in critical moments , on the big days , people did not so much listen to leaders as to their own instincts
1	at the same time , a sort of young workman , thin , pale , small , freckled , dressed in a torn smock and patched-up corduroy trousers , who looked more like a girl playing a boy than a man , came out of the lodge and told courfeyrac in a voice that was certainly not in any way like a woman ’ s voice : monsieur marius , please ?
1	to see is to devour
1	marius cast his eyes wildly around him ; the last , automatic resort of despair
1	she was happy , but more than anything else , she was stupefied
1	being virtuous , we obey them
1	why does she always take the backstreets ?
1	his range goes merrily from high comedy to farce
1	if i see them batting an eyelid !
1	he stayed where he was , petrified like the proverbial pillar of salt , not daring to make a move
1	jean valjean himself suspected nothing
1	he had a pipe clamped in his mouth and was puffing on it
1	which of the two would drop first ?
1	the counterrevolution was unintentionally liberal the same way that , through a corresponding phenomenon , napoléon was unintentionally revolutionary
1	it always causes your heart to lurch , seeing these clusters of men in black murmuring among themselves sotto voce on the threshold of courts of law
1	gloomy face-off of the egoists and the miserable
1	jean valjean made no changes to the furniture that was there the first day ; only , he had replaced the glass door of cosette ’ s small side room with a solid door
1	the cold , the worry , the anxiety , the anguish of the night were giving him a real fever and all these ideas were crashing around in his brain
1	he slipped through a breach and was back inside the town
1	i think i ’ m going to die
1	who has not felt ridiculous joy like that in moments of horror ?
1	my dear bishop , the immortality of man is a fabulous fairy tale
1	grave and obscure questions , to the last of which any physiologist would probably have answered no , and without hestitating , if he had seen—in toulon , in hours of rest , which were for jean valjean hours of reverie , as he sat , arms crossed , on the bar of some capstan , the end of his chain stuffed in his pocket to stop it from dragging—this forlorn galley slave , number grave , silent , and pensive , a pariah of laws that look on man with anger , one of civilization ’ s damned , who looked so harshly on the heavens
1	for the requirements of this battle , misery has invented a language of combat and that language is slang
1	grass had invaded half of them and green mildew covered the rest
1	my children , don ’ t cry , i ’ m not going far
1	he went from black to red , from red to purple , and from purple to a dangerous flare
1	at an anniversary te deum celebrating the return of the bourbons , seeing monsieur de talleyrandnumber go by , he said : there goes his excellency , evil
1	jean valjean threw himself fully dressed onto his bed and did not sleep a wink all night
1	you must have thought i was a real idiot when you went off with the lark !
1	this presented onlookers with a vision not unlike a pipe of young girls , a sort of living pan ’ s pipe made up of angels
1	he dimly remembered his other nocturnal trip on the great plain not far from digne
1	this man , as we already know , was a tramp who had been found in a field , carrying a branch laden with ripe apples , torn off an apple tree in a neighbouring enclosure known as pierron close
1	didn ’ t you tell me a hundred and nine francs ?
1	every spring , in the stand of acacias outside your windows , a nightingale comes
1	the part of the village on the gagny side drew its water from the glorious ponds in the woods ; but the other end , surrounding the church on the chelles side , only found drinking water at a little spring halfway up a hill close to the chelles road , about a quarter of an hour away from montfermeil
1	red , he said as he came in , eyeing enjolras steadily
1	miner ’ s spikes were made of solid iron , with a point at the bottom end for hoeing into the rock
1	the bishop remained silent for a moment , then he looked up with a grave expression on his face and spoke softly to madame magloire : to start with , was the silver really ours ?
1	quot libras in duce ? number
1	he said to his majesty : there ’ s a man with a mean mug for you
1	they saw gavroche totter , then he crumpled
1	meanwhile , as he continued up the street , he noticed a girl of about thirteen or fourteen , frozen stiff under a porte cochère and begging , her clothes so short you could see her knees
1	what would your aunt have said ?
1	when gavroche had disappeared at the turn of the rue des ballets , babet took thénardier aside : did you get a good look at that shaver ?
1	they also found a little blue steel saw that could be hidden in the retooled sou
1	we are fleeing in the arms of laffitte and on the wings of caillard
1	all god ’ s works are made to serve love
1	he probably made a point of not going too far in certain issues and conundrums reserved to a certain extent for towering and terrifying minds
1	her amazement had nothing aggressive about it ; it was not in the least the scandalized , envious attitude of an owl gazing upon two turtledoves ; hers was the dazed eye of a poor innocent of fifty-seven ; it was life that had missed out gazing on that triumph , love
1	father , he silently prayed , forgive me !
1	slow and measured footsteps reverberated along the channel for a while , but they were more and more dampened the farther away they got ; the pack of black shapes slunk into the gloom , a glimmer of light wavered and fluttered , turning the curved arch of the vault a kind of red , before dwindling and disappearing ; silence once more fell , profound , blindness and deafness again took hold of the darkness , and jean valjean , not yet daring to move again , stayed for a long time with his back to the wall , ears pricked , eyes wide open , watching the vanishing phantom patrol
1	'such a conception of information leads to a disturbing fascination with images filmed live , with scenes of violence and gruesome human interest stories ' , ignacio ramonet writes on the impact of television on the print media
1	they wouldn ’ t let the boy come into the printer ’ s because he got in the way , they said
1	javert was perfectly certain that he would not get away
1	i motion to madame magloire not to go against him
1	a poor woman must croak in the hospital !
1	overwhelmed with shame even more than despair , she left the workshop and went back to her room
1	marius went on : i ’ ve been thinking , you should know my address , anything could happen , you never know ; i live at that old friend of mine ’ s , courfeyrac , rue de la verrerie , number sixteen
1	he had the impression you would have if you had suddenly come face-to-face with a tiger in the dark
1	something amorphous came from the boulevard and turned into the causeway
1	it was only seven or eight minutes from the clearing in the woods to the spring
1	he watched the revolt going on around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge
1	he was wearing his workingman ’ s jacket and trousers of coarse grey cotton , and his cap with the long peak hid his face
1	the main leaders , as they said in the faubourg , kept out of sight
1	so then i said : i can ’ t live anywhere but here
1	neither monsieur leblanc nor the young girl had set foot in the luxembourg again
1	this gentleman was already old when they were young
1	demolition may be useful ; but i don ’ t trust any demolition that ’ s caught up in rage
1	perhaps they had escaped from some unlocked guardhouse ; perhaps , somewhere in the neighbourhood—at the barrière d ’ enfer or on the esplanade of the observatoire or in the neighbouring square overlooked by the pediment on which you can read : invenerunt parvulum pannis involutumnumber—there was some run-down booth set up by street players that they had run away from ; perhaps , the night before , they had managed to evade the garden keepers at closing time and had spent the night in one of those huts where people sit around reading the newspapers
1	thénardier had discreetly snuck off , without daring to say good night , not wanting to show excessive cordiality to a man he was planning to fleece royally the following morning
1	you can still count forty-three balusters in place on their bases ; the rest are lying in the grass
1	courfeyrac said to bahorel : would you believe it ?
1	he brought his chair closer to the fireplace and sat down , folding his arms and holding his muddy boots up to the stove
1	he was one of those luckless men that nature churns out as wild animals to start with and that society turns into galley slaves in the end
1	we ’ re going to bring him back , have him here with us , whether he likes it or not , he won ’ t be leaving us ever again
1	a voice in his conscience answered him : the most divine form of human generosity , atonement for others
1	great pain is a divine and terrible ray of light that transforms the wretched
1	who cares who threatens our heads or our purses !
1	she did not complain , she did not accuse
1	it was this that had spoken to him
1	he can ’ t help it
1	marius was vaguely amazed
1	bawl your eyes out !
1	misery is like anything else
1	the man everyone forgets , but whom we have named , bruneseau
1	it feels like the gloom-laden door of winter has remained ajar and that that is where the wind is coming from
1	history will take his loyalty into account
1	they were giant men on colossal horses
1	it preys on women , meaning on grace , on weakness , on beauty , on the maternal
1	tongues were loosened ; a firestorm of jeering and swearing and singing erupted
1	everything bows down before success , even grammar
1	madame magloire , the bishop replied , you are mistaken
1	in any case , our despair has the peculiarity of wrapping itself around others as it does us , so it seemed only logical to him that everybody had come to die
1	monsieur , said marius , with the look of a man knowing he is about to plummet over a precipice , i ’ ve come to ask your permission to marrynumber
1	they were just sitting there
1	the next day jean valjean had decamped
1	why in hell did i think it was javert ?
1	i am not in
1	monsieur myriel was the son of a councillor of the aix parliament , a member of the noblesse de robenumber they reckoned his father had put him down to inherit his position and so had married him off very early in the piece when he was only eighteen or twenty , as they used to do quite a lot in parliamentary families
1	some money to an agent
1	and then it seems they cut the flesh with scissors
1	it is already too late , the sand is above his knees
1	two or three of them had a straw rope tied to the struts of the wagon , which hung down under them like a stirrup and supported their feet
1	you decide on the amount yourself , and you will have it
1	the new history , the history involving the time of history ’ ( the mid-to-late nineteenth century ) , can only maintain what it is saying at the cost of endlessly transforming monuments into documents and documents into monuments
1	he had javert ’ s bull neck
1	i am no longer a royalist except when it comes to that particular royalty
1	but i kept it
1	as for the number and length of their prayers , the best we can do to give some idea of this is to cite the guileless words of one of the nuns : the prayers of the postulants are frightening , the prayers of the novices are even worse , and the prayers of the professed nuns are worse still
1	for , o mesdames , there were bombardas in greece and egypt
1	but the hand relaxed and released him
1	the whole thickness of a house and a host of vacant rooms separated this rathole from the boulevard , and its only window looked out on vast wastelands blocked off behind walls and paling fences
1	brought his body with him : habeas corpus ; all those corporal arts whose vestiges remain the actor and the dancer
1	later , some weeks afterwards , when he thought about it , he had no idea where he had dined that particular evening
1	look at his eyes , will you !
1	this variation on solomon ’ s cry got a sigh from the woman
1	ah , i ’ m a monstrous ingrate
1	by virtue of the right to come and go , which implies the right to remain at home
1	this child would have been the pride and joy of the colonel in his loneliness ; but the grandfather had imperiously claimed his grandson , declaring that , if he was not handed over , he would disinherit him
1	to pray to god , what does that mean ?
1	he had designed the workshops in order to keep the sexes separate so the women and girls could remain virtuous
1	he got to his feet , shivering , frozen , rank , bent under the dying man he was lugging , all streaming with muck , his soul full of a strange light
1	a few friends gathered twice a week around her widow ’ s fireside and this constituted an unadulteratedly royalist salon
1	he had gone past lillois and bois-seigneur-isaac
1	sign of rain , children
1	this patrol had just been through the curved gallery and the three dead ends lying under the rue du cadran
1	théodule answered with all the calm of a man in the artillery : some skirt
1	silence in front of jean-jacques !
1	double shackles for nothing
1	a number of batteries were scattered around unhorsed
1	the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and in darkness
1	let ’ s see , there ’ s a poor old man that needs an angel
1	i ’ m as fond of it as i am of my two daughters , it brings back such memories !
1	in one , the writer 's face splits in two to reveal the face of the internee
1	interesting that those days of euphemism in verse were the days of bluntness in prose
1	he was not sick
1	it ’ s good that such a moment has witnesses
1	in which case , there ’ s the fifteen-franc fine
1	men gather together and live in common
1	who of , do we know ?
1	number pound of powder
1	it no longer exists today
1	i say cunningly , for , through a donation of the kind , to slip into an honourable household , the comforts of which he will share , and , by the same token , cover up his crime , to enjoy the fruits of his theft , bury his name , and create himself a family—that would not be particularly inept
1	where did he go ?
1	the two little boys were playing in the backyard at the time and saw nothing of the raid
1	he felt like he was already an immense distance away from life
1	jondrette had let his pipe go out , a serious sign of intense preoccupation , and had come and sat back down again
1	the title of the conference was : 'the elimination of nature as a theme in contemporary art '
1	she expected to be reassured , that her father would just shrug his shoulders and tell her : you are a silly little girl
1	you know how he knows everything and how good his memory is , for he is still a good royalist
1	this manuscript , in which she saw more clarity than obscurity , had the effect on her of a sanctuary whose door suddenly cracked open
1	marius took off at that , rather sheepishly , but also thrilled
1	nobody could look more resolute and amazing
1	the horses were hitched and the travellers , summoned by the coach driver , were busily clambering up the steep iron steps of the clapped-out crate
1	then he called gavroche
1	can the inexhaustible have a right ?
1	have you got hollow legs ?
1	the police officers returned in block formation and within a few seconds javert ’ s order had been executed
1	the stranger said calmly : come , cosette
1	a very skinny poodle had just walked past
1	it has its main centres where it holds steady
1	and the old man let go of montparnasse and put his purse in montparnasse ’ s hand
1	he put on his presentable coat , tied a scarf around his neck , grabbed his hat and went out , without making any more noise than if he had been walking barefoot on moss
1	a biscuit , answered babet
1	but had she forgotten him ?
1	did they persist in some fatal vice that sank them ?
1	as the secondhand book and bric-a-brac dealers could see that he was forced to sell , they bought off him for twenty sous what he had paid twenty francs for—sometimes to the same booksellers
1	to come out of nowhere and take the reins , to march and to triumph , to have all the capitals of europe as stops along the way , to take his grenadiers and turn them into kings , to decree the downfall of dynasties , to change the face of europe as you charge on , for people to feel , when you threaten them , that you have your hand on the hilt of the sword of god , to follow hannibal , caesar , and charlemagne in the person of one man , to be the nation of a man who greets you every dawn with the glorious announcement of a battle won , to have the cannon of the invalides as your alarm clock , to hurl into the endless light mighty words that blaze out for all time , marengo , arcola , austerlitz , jena , wagram !
1	he was pale and shaking slightly
1	but so much the better , if that ’ s all it is , it ’ s nothing
1	why do you keep asking questions but you never give answers ?
1	suppose the ground had been dry ; the artillery could have rolled , the action would have begun at six in the morning
1	suicide , that mysterious assault and battery against the unknown , which may to a certain extent involve the death of the soul , was impossible for jean valjean
1	old gillenormand stuttered in a voice just above a whisper : sh-ssh-ow him in
1	how are things , monsieur montparnasse ?
1	do you know , the father went on , it ’ s as cold as a nun ’ s nasty in this dump of a place !
1	he didn ’ t know how to fall
1	behind this star , moving around confusedly , were eight or ten black shapes , erect , indistinct , terrifying
1	what a nice respectable notice i ’ d chuck him then !
1	yes , an honest man
1	what had gone on in his soul ?
1	but what could she do about it ?
1	we can only relate what we ’ ve heard , but generally he spent his life doing the same thing at the same time every day
1	madame fabantou looks to me to be much better ?
1	every time that fate , which gets mixed up in the promenades of people whose eyes are turned inward , took marius into this path , which was practically every day , he would find this couple there
1	no one had seen her , except the traveller , who was slowly eating his meagre supper
1	no doubt we could question the filmmakers and quibble with deleuze , their interpreter , over the exact gauging of this very precise relationship ’
1	he owed gratitude on several sides ; he owed some to his father , he owed some to himself
1	the very moment he shouted i am a miserable bastard !
1	that terrifying lowest common denominator , shame , had passed over these foreheads ; at this level of debasement , the final transformations were undergone by all in the final depths , absolute rock bottom ; and ignorance turned to stupor was indistinguishable from intelligence turned to despair
1	don ’ t call me father anymore
1	that god is hard up
1	and this would happen today at the latest , and perhaps that very morning
1	the officers were afraid of getting things wrong , for the prefect put the blame on them ; a mistake meant dismissal
1	from time to time a traffic jam occurred somewhere in the procession of vehicles , and one or the other of the two lines would stop just long enough for the knot to be disentangled ; one carriage held up was enough to bring the whole line to a standstill
1	a man who has not been a relentless opponent in fair weather , when the enemy is at his peak , should keep quiet in foul , when the enemy collapses
1	he felt as if he were swimming in the wide blue sky
1	at the gunshots , at the cries of the guards who had been hit , the assailants had scaled the entrenchment , and a throng of municipal guards , soldiers of the line , and national guards from the suburbs could now be seen over the top of it , more than waist-high , with guns in hand
1	what was remarkable about the champ de mai celebration was that it was held on the champ de mars and in the month of june
1	these ghouls start out as larvae in dire poverty and then move on to crime—a fatal line of descent , a dizzying begetting , the logic of the dark
1	the lame old man who was following it was , of course , none other than fauchelevent
1	no , she said , i ’ ve only got two hands and i ’ ve got two chairs to carry
1	who ’ s that coming down there ?
1	but in the deserted alleys around the rue de poliveau he felt reasonably sure no one was coming after him
1	this tenant who created so little stir was jean valjean and the young girl was cosette
1	when cosette urged him to do so , he would say : send for the dog doctor
1	each tries to make the other slip
1	he saw a flaring light and around that flaring light , spectres
1	they stand , lie , sit , legs curled up , legs dangling ; the women camp on the men ’ s knees
1	and he went every day to the field of the lark
1	and he showed éponine , through the treetops , a light moving around in the attic of the villa
1	i ’ ll take you to see the executioner
1	the young girls spent hours listening to it , the vocal mothers were incensed , brains became overwrought , punishments rained down
1	there , he heard a very faint little sound that was like a child breathing
1	monsieur le maire had been gone two or three minutes when the door swung open again ; it was monsieur le maire
1	she was a nun the way others are cooks
1	stepping carelessly into the caved-in sewer , they could lose their lives there
1	it had been paved with flagstones , but under the oozing waters the flagstones had rotted and cracked
1	one of these flashes , one of these faint stirrings of hope , suddenly ran through the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie , at the most unexpected moment
1	said the man , and he fell back into his reverie
1	the doctor washed marius ’ s face and hair with cold water
1	the embryonic labour of the future is one of the visions of the philosopher
1	so we may as well believe in nothing
1	haven ’ t you ever snitched apples over a wall that ’ s got the bottoms of glass bottles stuck on it , then ?
1	the silly brute submits
1	you may read it , he said
1	courfeyrac yelled : get back !
1	a second later she was back in her spot , sitting down , not moving , just turned in such a way as to cast a shadow over the doll , which she held in her arms
1	and with that , he sped off to the jail , rushed to the cell of the circus monkey , called him by his name , took his hand and talked to him
1	not on the les halles side , said enjolras
1	but police officers are on the lookout and there ensues a highly dramatic situation , of the kind that once gave rise to a memorable fraternal cry
1	their great horses reared up , leaped over the ranks , jumped over the bayonets , and fell , gigantic , in the middle of those four living walls
1	madame magloire looked intelligent , sharp , and good ; the corners of her mouth were crooked when she smiled and her top lip was fatter than her bottom lip , which made her look somewhat obdurate and imperious
1	and let ’ s stick to it !
1	you put politicals in the same basket as murderers
1	plain unadulterated happiness is like plain unadulterated bread : you eat , but you don ’ t dine
1	fancy , i didn ’ t think of that
1	you can ’ t imagine , the first time i saw her was in the luxembourg , she used to go there ; in the beginning , i didn ’ t pay her much attention and then i don ’ t know how it happened , but i fell in love with her
1	gavroche spun around proudly and shot back : if you ’ re killed before me , i ’ ll take yours
1	cosette thought he ’ d gone mad , and did as she was told
1	this new chief , god , he sensed unexpectedly and this disturbed him
1	beyond that , the opacity was massive ; to penetrate further into it seemed horrible , to step into it felt like being swallowed up
1	my soul soars over virgin forests and savannas
1	and you can ’ t get anything dirty !
1	no , said dahlia , it ’ s tholomyès ’ s idea
1	gluttony punishes the glutton
1	perhaps in too much haste
1	what is really at work here is the actual cloning , over and over , of some super- , no , hyper- abstraction that \\till be to virtual reality what hyper-realislvi was to the photographic shot
1	this is direct religion , full of anxiety and liability for those who risk themselves on its dizzying cliffs
1	hence the impossibility of uttering , even for cosette , the name : fantine
1	in future , be on time
1	if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a room at the inn , there would have been no witnesses , no one would have heard it , things would have been left at that , and it is quite likely that we would not have to relate any of the events you are going to read about
1	i didn ’ t know any and i didn ’ t acknowledge any
1	in the course of this tale , the author of this book has come across this curious moment in contemporary history on his travels ; he could not help but cast a glance at it in passing and outline some of the singular features of that long-lost social world
1	she felt a bit like she was walking along next to god
1	thénardier tried in vain to hide among the branches , but there was nothing he could do to stop the man from seeing him
1	in this situation , jean valjean mused , and what do you think was the nature of his musings ?
1	i ’ ve come from the spring in the woods
1	he did not disdain servant girls and so his wife did not have any anymore
1	there is , at the extreme of all debasements and all personal disasters , one last form of misery that rebels and decides to do battle with the whole raft of happy facts and reigning rights ; an appalling battle where , now cunning , now violent , at once morbid and wild , it attacks the social order through the pin-pricks of vice and through the club blows of crime
1	if it ’ s a mother , the mothers lay her out ; if it ’ s a sister , the sisters lay her out
1	mademoiselle baptistine was a tall , pale , thin , sweet person , the personification of that ideal expressed by the word respectable ; for it seems a woman must be a mother to be esteemed
1	ah , don ’ t say that , not even for a laugh !
1	among other odd things , he let slip one evening when he found himself at the home of one of the most eminent of his colleagues : what fine clocks !
1	no one questions the right of a monastery to bury their dead themselves
1	a heap of crap has this going for it : it does not lie
1	she led him into a low room where there were tables with oilskins for tablecloths
1	an imp and a little devil , he made a medley of the voices of nature and the voices of paris
1	those men were fighting not to be turned away from death ’ s door
1	montparnasse himself , though in a way practically thénardier ’ s son-in-law , gave in
1	the fleming stood there with his mouth open—like an idiot , as he himself put it some time later
1	as for mother hucheloup , she ’ s a good old sort
1	let ’ s see the girl
1	marius jumped down from the parapet he was sitting on and wildy clutched her hand

1	jean valjean looked down at the window outlined on the parquet floor at his feet by the sun
1	but children are innocent of the crimes of their fathers
1	thirty-two parishes , forty-one vicarages , and two hundred and eighty branch parishes
1	anyone for a game of skittles ?
1	his wealthy female penitents and the devout women of digne had chipped in to provide a fine new altar for the monseigneur ’ s oratory ; he had taken the money every time and given it to the poor
1	this retooled sou was one of those marvels of patient industry that the galleys foster in the dark and for the dark , marvels that are nothing less than the instruments of escape
1	on the following days , he returned as usual to the luxembourg ; as usual , he found the father and daughter there , but he no longer took any notice of them
1	he turned out to be an old émigré gentleman , blind and ruined , who played the flute in his garret to while away the time
1	be lucky and the rest will fall into place
1	what a man was convinced of was crumbling !
1	get out of there !
1	joy is the backward surge of terror
1	whenever she passed by the factory at times when the workers were hanging around the doors , she would put on an act , laughing and singing
1	she had not been to bed
1	now , in broad daylight , in that wide-mouthed street , surprise was decidedly impossible , the gloves were off , the cannon had begun roaring , the army was hurling itself at the barricade
1	the tread was heavy and reverberated like a man ’ s tread , but the old woman wore thick shoes and nothing sounds more like a man ’ s tread than the tread of an old woman
1	you are too young to have taken on the serious business of attacking the government on your own
1	ma hucheloup , true to life , went back and forth morning and night in front of those four lines with perfect serenity
1	i water them myself
1	the rest of the troops were stationed in the barracks as reserves , without counting the regiments from the outskirts of paris
1	during dessert , the senator , who was a bit tipsy by then , although still dignified , suddenly launched himself
1	jean valjean haunted them as a predilection
1	the two cousins knew each other only by name
1	monsieur le maire , i have come to beg you to be so kind as to see to it that the authorities dismiss me
1	did you lose it , the fifteen-sou coin ?
1	no you ’ re not , marius replied in an imploring tone
1	come and choose pitchers and jugs ,
1	in number , as the ultimate disasters were in the air , number as france shuddered at their sinister approach , as waterloo could dimly be perceived opening up before napoléon , the sorrowful acclaim of the army and of the people , cheering on a man who had been condemned by destiny , had nothing laughable about it , and with all our reservations about the despot , a heart like the bishop of digne ’ s should not , perhaps , have been so impervious to all that was noble and moving , at the edge of the abyss , in the tight embrace of a great nation and a great man
1	at that very moment , a loud knock was heard at the door
1	they broke into houses where the women were , made them hand over the absent husband ’ s sabre and fusil , and wrote over the door in spanish white : weapons have been handed over
1	monsieur , he said , i ’ m the one who got you this cart
1	because he was still in doubt
1	your sister-in-law is still here with her young family
1	'we are trying to get a background of ambient sound ' , explains a spokesman for the british station
1	it was a seigneurial garden in the first french style that preceded le nôtre ; number today , nothing but ruins and brambles
1	the statues under the trees , naked and white , had frocks of shade riddled with light ; these goddesses were all in tatters of sunshine ; sunbeams hung from them on all sides
1	only maternal instinct , that admirable intuition into which the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman enter , knows how and with what this half-light should be made
1	what direction would he take ?
1	the most lighthearted became solemn in pronouncing that date : number their flesh-and-blood fathers were , or had been , feuillants , royalists , doctrinaires ; number it didn ’ t matter much ; this mishmash that came before them , the young , did not concern them ; the blue blood of principles ran in their veins
1	there are such things as magic spells
1	the emperor straightened up and gathered himself together
1	the fathomless pit of the social unknown had silently closed over those beings
1	you know what , monsieur marius ?
1	it is more than great , it is immense
1	this last book fascinated him even more because his garden had been one of the places once haunted by goblins
1	mademoiselle gillenormand was a kind of crepuscular soul
1	grantaire was getting stuck into his second bottle and perhaps his second harangue when a new creature emerged from the square hole at the top of the stairs

1	whenever there was someone staying in the alcove , a big heavy serge curtain was drawn from one side of the oratory to the other , and it hid the altar
1	if , by the deformity of certain terms , we recognize that it has been chewed up by the outlaw mandrin , number by the splendour of certain metonyms we can feel it has been spoken by villonnumber
1	he took no notice of the concierge ’ s words , went to bed and went to sleep
1	what was happening inside javert was the diverting of a rectilinear conscience , the throwing off course of a soul , the smashing of a probity irresistibly launched straight ahead and shattering against god
1	is there a mutt in the garden ?
1	it ’ s hell , i tell you !
1	where are we going ?
1	this was a vast shapeless set of horizontal planks , the top ones wider than the bottom ones , held together by long transverse iron bands
1	he withdrew with his head down , crossed the antechamber , and slowly went back down the stairs , as though hesitating at every step
1	if he felt like a walk : yes , my darling father
1	the porter did not finish his sentence
1	it was also whispered that he had immense sums of money deposited at laffitte , with one peculiar stipulation , which was that the money was always immediately available , so that , it was added , monsieur madeleine could turn up any morning at laffitte ’ s , sign a receipt , and cart off his two or three million in ten minutes flat
1	she ran to her transom and opened it
1	you see , it ’ s over nine years that i ’ ve had her by my side
1	ulm , wagram , jena , friedland , number died with them

1	the man walking hunched over was an ex-convict and what he was lugging on his shoulders was a corpse
1	dust was safe there
1	no one should worry on his account
1	there was a time , in the s , when the power of illusion ’ of cinema , the conjunction of the eye that records and the eye that draws , of machinic radiography and symphonic montage , was viewed as defining a supreme art , one that buried the stale old notions of psychological man and representational fiction , and was up to speed with manufacturing man and the new collective
1	it is no longer made up of anything but what is pure ; it no longer relies on anything but what is elevated and grand
1	the ordinary everyday metaphor answers : voir trente-six chandelles , to see thirty-six candles—to see stars
1	then he began the monotonous and grim pacing that troubled the dreams of the man below him and woke him with a start from his sleep
1	the zeal sometimes went as far as extermination
1	as for jondrette , he had not quit the overcoat , new and far too big for him , that monsieur leblanc had given him , and his outfit continued to offer that contrast between overcoat and trousers that constituted the ideal of the poet in courfeyrac ’ s view
1	we will remake eden by learning what a + b equals
1	mother thénardier threw a look at the bandits who had got themselves tied up and growled in a raucous gutteral voice : cowards !
1	is there another wheelwright ?
1	the lieutenant , little accustomed to encountering such venerable personages , stammered rather timidly , hello , uncle , and performed a mixed salutation consisting of an involuntary and mechanical attempt at a military salute finishing in a bourgeois bow
1	how does it manage to suddenly stop everyone in their tracks ?
1	marius blamed himself and almost hated himself for not getting anywhere in his searches
1	i like that name , he said
1	he put the suitcase on a chair by his bed and he carried the key to it on him always
1	cosette had resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting
1	yes , the people , roughly sketched out by the eighteenth century , will be completed by the nineteenth
1	and they fell irresistibly into each other ’ s arms
1	he looked as though he was ready either to smash the old man ’ s skull in or to kiss his hand
1	at certain moments , she saw him as a burning candle ; at others , she felt him as a claw
1	you look like you had a pretty face until someone accidentally sat on it
1	did he have wings ?
1	seven vehicles were moving in single file along the road
1	he circled himself , over and over again ; he felt himself to be puny and he wept many times
1	the likes of us , we ’ ll only know two hours beforehand on the day
1	what could a man hold on to ?
1	neither jean valjean , nor cosette , nor toussaint ever came in or went out except through the door on the rue de babylone
1	if my son should meet up with him , he will do whatever he can for thénardier
1	as he had been a mayor , he knew how to resolve a delicate problem that he alone was in on the secret of : cosette ’ s civil status
1	the winds of revolution are not easily controlled
1	she resorted to the expedient of children who are always frightened ; she lied
1	is there anything the blind man is deprived of ?
1	cosette piped up : that is , there are two little girls
1	hours all white , almost all alike
1	anyone who had seen her a quarter of an hour earlier would not have believed their eyes
1	the soldiers began searching the surrounding houses and going after the fugitives
1	he said to marius : we are the two leaders
1	nothing can beat a pile of stones for longevity—unless it is a paling fence
1	little by little you ’ ll see its whiskers and you ’ ll get a shock
1	he was eighteen years old at the time
1	i ’ m well aware that this seems unlikely
1	it was at this time , when six months had gone by , that marius saw her again at the luxembourg
1	are they crazy , these damned peasants ?
1	a mason going home after a day ’ s work left a small packet on a bench near the pont d ’ austerlitz
1	when we ’ ve put the baby to bed , said the gravedigger
1	just like a yellowed photograph of the deceased mounted on their tomb , the monochro ma tic segment merely signals the obscurantism of a bygone era , the dvvindling of a heroic age in
1	he weighed , he reflected , he considered the alternatives presented by the mysterious balance of light and shadow
1	do not we therefore need to refine fortini 's pronouncement and the marxism of straub and huillet ?
1	all right , look alive !
1	liberty being assured , power must be looked to
1	we must have pity on animals
1	he gathered the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her to the farthest corner of the shed , behind a pile of old furniture that was no longer in use
1	there were two wicker prie-dieu chairs in the oratory , and an armchair also made of wicker in the bedroom
1	this sort of thing will keep happening as long as they go off and read the newspapers under the arches of the odéon
1	the man had sat down there to let cosette have a little rest
1	and so this sorry soul went on debating with himself in anguish
1	fire lapped at his feet , which can now only be seen as blackened stumps , then it stopped
1	they ’ d sing out : look !
1	as he turned round , he realized that marius was watching him pace
1	she was an orphan
1	the sixteenth it is !
1	how could he get her warm again ?
1	but marius ’ s convalescence had become a habit and the rue des filles-du-calvaire armchairs , better for tête-à-têtes than the straw-bottomed chairs of the rue de l ’ homme-armé , had firmly established it
1	in her anxiety , cosette had looked through the gate and spotted éponine in her man ’ s getup , now prowling endlessly about the garden
1	you would have said that the man who had died was studying those who were about to die
1	in those days , galleys were to the navy what steamers are today
1	these considerations exhausted , he moved on to jean valjean himself
1	marius could find no words and jean valjean spoke again : thank you
1	kempt , on the left wing , called for reinforcements
1	i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honour of being yuseful to you
1	maybe i was wrong to get annoyed
1	the moment the hanoverian lieutenant wilda took hold of the handle to seek refuge inside the farmhouse , a french sapper chopped his hand off with an axe
1	it sedates the sometimes high fevers of the overwrought brain at work and produces a soft fresh vapour in the mind that smooths out the oversharp points of pure thought , fills up the gaps and holes here and there , binds things together and blunts the jagged corners of ideas
1	the bush having been viewed , tholomyès shouted : donkeys , everyone—my treat !
1	cosette was just as horrified but in a slightly different way
1	on one body , which was that of a corporal , he found a powder horn
1	it has as its aim , and should have as its result , the dissolving of anger through the study of antagonisms
1	he waited , hoping for some incident , no matter what , unable to gather his wits and not knowing whose side to take
1	elsewhere , they merely show , merely provide a record for posterity
1	i an old-world salon
1	intentionally and beyond what was intended
1	he remained silent for a moment before adding : look at the happiness of others
1	in the twinkling of an eye , before javert had time to turn round , he was collared , laid out , tied up , frisked
1	and that poor mother can bring up her daughter !
1	the cart had been freed
1	they were witty , but they were a little too silent ; their political dogma was properly starched with arrogance , but they were a little too driven
1	for cosette , listening to marius talk politics ;
1	send my daughter in
1	cosette was standing in her own shadow , as marius was in his , all ready to take fire and blaze
1	in that case , sell me a pair of wheels
1	wherever telepresence has taken over
1	some of her words were lost in the journey from larynx to lips as on a keyboard that is missing some notes
1	he stood there for a few minutes with his head down , drawing in the sand with a stick
1	the next day at the usual time , marius dug his new coat out of his wardrobe , along with his new trousers and his new boots ; he donned the complete panoply , pulled on gloves , an extravagant luxury , and took himself off to the luxembourg
1	the government paid them a small pension ; the ladies of petit-picpus had rushed to take them in
1	that shone out clear as the light of day
1	and monsieur bombarda , the magnificent restaurateur , gives you these three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs fifty centimes !
1	cosette , seeing her father sick and wounded , had deserted the villa , regaining her taste for the little cottage and the backyard
1	in the circuit court
1	they knew , by a wonderfully subtle instinct , that certain kinds of concern can get in the way
1	as in the ocean , the diver can disappear there
1	in , speaking about his film without images , vvhich mounted a defence of the marquis de sade , debord claimed he wanted to kill the cinema 'because it was easier than killing a passer-by '
1	the fall was such a bad one that his chest was taking the whole weight of the cart
1	you do what you like
1	you ’ ve done the right thing , coming to see a man who is about to die
1	the dazzle of success is goading biologists implacably on , each obstacle overcome leading them to take up the next challenge - a challenge even greater , even more insane ?
1	a man in the cart taking him to the gallows is listening to his confessor
1	there aren ’ t many people out walking on this boulevard , especially in winter
1	this was the barricade of the faubourg du temple
1	i don ’ t let myself be hoodwinked by make-believe
1	there ’ s a proud old war veteran for you !
1	this is what we have called the third substage—the dregs , rock bottom
1	old boulatruelle is the montfermeil road-mender we have already caught sight of in the dark sections of this book
1	once , on the subject of education , which marius thought should be free and compulsory , spread far and wide in all its forms , lavished on all like the air and the sun , in a word , breathable by the whole population , they were in complete agreement and almost chatted
1	chatting away perfectly naturally and quietly all the while , she pressed on marius all the longings of a virginal and passionate gaze
1	marius ’ s great pleasure was to take long walks alone along the outer boulevards or in the champ de mars or along the less frequented allées of the luxembourg gardens
1	this road was and still is a trench for most of its length ; a trench sometimes twelve feet deep , whose too steep embankments would collapse here and there , especially in winter , in the rain
1	cosette , as we ’ ve said , had not been sick
1	he anticipated that he would perhaps not return to the rue plumet , and he could not leave toussaint behind or tell her his secret
1	its deceptive resemblance to merit has people fooled
1	pleasing a bishop is a foot in the door for a subdeaconnumber after all , a person has to carve out a niche for himself and so clerics never disdain sinecures
1	not many of the paths were paved , not many of the streets were built on
1	this peace based on 'the balance of terror ' not only between east and west but also between the forms and figures of an aesthctics of disappear- ance that would come to charactcrize the whole fin de siecle
1	the arch was sealed off by a heavy gate and this gate , which , to all appearances , rarely turned on its oxidized hinges , was held fast in its stone frame by a heavy lock , red with rust , that looked like an enormous brick
1	a voice replied : this is a prison , not an inn
1	the cabarets of the rue de charonne were serious and stormy , though the conjunction of the two adjectives seems odd when applied to cabarets
1	none of the young recluses could get a look at him because of the serge curtain , but he had a soft and slightly reedy voice that they had come to recognize and distinguish
1	i don ’ t know if the man who gave them to me is pleased with me up there
1	a harsh thought , oddly emerging from the clatter of words , suddenly pierced through the verbal free-for-all in which grantaire , bahorel , prouvaire , bossuet , combeferre , and courfeyrac were chaotically clashing swords
1	monsieur thénardier , you are right , he definitely owes that , mumured the wife , who was thinking of the doll given to cosette in front of her girls
1	we saw a man go past completely naked , the colour of ash , mounted on a horse the colour of dirt
1	lieutenants have themselves crowned kings ; foremen play at being manufacturers
1	he had no more suspicion of his splendid reputation than has a steer from durham or surrey whose portrait is published in the illustrated london news with this caption : the steer that won first prize in the cattle show
1	dating from that moment , was it purely by chance ?
1	with twenty-five thousand men , we can face them
1	the first lot were men ; these were women
1	if so-called old-master art remained denzonstrative right up until the nineteenth century with impres- sionism , the art of the twentieth century became amonstrative ' in the sense that it is contemporary with the shattering effect of mass societies , subject as they are to the conditioning of opinion and niass media propaganda - and this , with the same mounting extrelnism evident in terrorism or total war
1	why didn ’ t he attack right away ?
1	the poor woman shuddered
1	no one moved a muscle in that stoical audience
1	little by little he developed the habit of staying longer
1	at one extreme the artist , like the journalist , is red undant in the face-off between performer and viever
1	he wrote a letter which he then sealed , and wrote an address on the envelope that you could have read , had you been in the room at the time : to monsieur laffitte , banker , rue d ’ artois , at paris
1	serious men wondered what monsieur de trinquelague would do on such and such an occasion ; monsieur clausel de montals differed , on this or that point , with monsieur clausel de coussergues ; monsieur de salaberry was not happynumber the actor picard , number who belonged to the académie , which molière had never been able to get into , put on les deux philibert at the odéon , number on the pediment of which , though the letters had been torn off , you could still clearly read : thétre de l ’ impératrice
1	thénardier made a move toward her
1	he bowed his head ; when he raised it again , they were almost upon him
1	the old man kept his eyes on the ground but decided to reply : what , mother plutarch ?
1	the evening of the day she had delivered her two little boys to mother magnon , with the firm intention of giving them up for good , mother thénardier had , or pretended she had , a scruple
1	a kind of slide occurs as a result of this mannheim terrorist manifesto , just as it does with the exhibition 'sensation ' in london and new york : it will not be long before we are forced to acknowledge that the german expressionists who called for murder were not the only avant-garde artists
1	the stranger turned to face him and replied mildly : ah !
1	war can be appallingly beautiful and we have not tried to hide this ; it can also be , i think we all agree , somewhat ugly
1	this encounter worried him for a few days , then faded
1	all of a sudden , he stopped and smacked his forehead the way a man will when he has forgotten something fundamental and is ready to retrace his steps
1	the insouciant bustling man on foot disappeared
1	he took the main street
1	i saw one once , a little thing , knee-high to a grasshopper
1	and so i despise the human race
1	he got cosette out of all difficulties , though
1	it was a sign of elegance for all to see
1	at that moment , she struck marius as even more frightening than her husband
1	the terrified child looked at him and then began to quiver from head to toe and , after a few seconds of standing there stunned , he ran away as fast as his little legs would carry him , not daring to look back or to let out a whimper
1	what was this figure of darkness whose sole concern had been to protect a rising star from all shadow and from all cloud ?
1	the name romainville kept endlessly recurring , along with two lines of a song he ’ d once heard
1	in ten years , i ’ ll have earned ten million , i give it back to the community , i keep nothing myself , what ’ s it to me ?
1	they wore plumeless helmets and cuirasses of beaten iron , with cavalry pistols in their holsters and long sabres
1	this always finishes , it is true , in an awakening , but a tardy one
1	men are so lucky !
1	prejudices are the real thieves , vices are the murderers
1	i had a strong notion , as soon as you were better , to plant her right here at your bedside , but it ’ s only in novels that one sticks young girls without further ado by the beds of the pretty wounded lads they ’ ve got their eye on
1	marius looked at this man
1	jean valjean went on : monsieur pontmercy , have no fear , i implore you
1	to sum up , we might agree that when you see those paving stones , you think of the bear in its pit , the monster in its lair , and that is the sort of goodwill that raises society ’ s hackles
1	in his dread of what was being set up and in the horror into which the jondrettes had plunged him , he felt a kind of joy that it might perhaps be given to him to do a great service to the one he loved
1	and that dear portrait of the divine shakespeare
1	he remained pensive for a moment , mechanically running the tip of his forefinger over the nail of his thumb , then he spoke up : that just about does it
1	as for imagining that you ’ ll make me talk , that you ’ ll make me write anything i don ’ t want to write , that you ’ ll make me say anything i don ’ t want to say—
1	then he added in a lowered voice : the mousetrap ’ s set
1	and he was one of the students who had got the most out of his studies in paris ; he knew that the best coffee was in the café lemblin and that the best billiard table was in the café voltaire ; that you got good cakes and good girls at l ’ ermitage on the boulevard du maine , spatchcock chickens at mother saguet ’ s , excellent fish stews at the barrière de la cunette , and a certain light white wine at the barrière du combat
1	two women , an old man who lives out the back ; there are plenty of good curtains at the windows
1	be that as it may , a mighty leap had been taken
1	raising eyes to heaven is an opus
1	brujon was deft ; gueulemer was strong
1	someone ’ s come through the sewer ?
1	every day jean valjean took cosette ’ s arm and took her out for a stroll
1	naïveté has taken refuge there , basil ’ s mask is found down there , but you can see the pasteboard and strings and the inside as well as the outside , and it is enhanced by honest muck
1	but this particular camera changed purpose and the images it shot match up with other images , taken behind other windows , to converge on this central point where the images of official television show us the romanian leader , the conducator , haranguing his usual audience but being interrupted by the spectacle and dissonant noise coming from the far end of the square
1	death has its own way of harassing victory , sending pestilence hot on the heels of glory
1	in the unfathomable depths of abstraction and pure speculation that , for all intents and purposes , lie beyond dogma , geniuses offer up their ideas to god
1	he was austere in his pleasures
1	one observer , a dreamer , the author of this book , who had gone to see the volcano up close , found himself caught in the crossfire in the arcade
1	she was at that age when a virgin carries her love the way an angel carries its lily
1	would you let me have the bucket again now ?
1	opposite these men , wild , we admit , and frightening , but wild and frightening for the good , there are other men , smiling , prettily primped up , gilded , beribboned , spangled , in silk stockings , white feathers , yellow gloves , brightly polished shoes , who , leaning on velvet tables at the corners of marble fireplaces , gently insist on the maintenance and preservation of the past , of the middle ages , of divine right , of fanaticism , ignorance , slavery , the death penalty , war , politely glorifying in hushed voices the sabre , the stake , and the scaffold
1	the sheet of water is healthy ; it comes from the sky first of all , then from the ground ; the sheet of air is unhealthy , it comes from the sewer
1	the secular leaders who followed suit had proclaimed : you have no right to live among us
1	smock frocks , smocks , caps , bristling heads caked with dirtnumber this mob undulated confusedly in the nocturnal fog
1	said the old man in a tone of reproach
1	someone ran right past him
1	in this hell-like tomb , what did they do ?
1	it seemed that this was some sort of agreement
1	he saw two roads before him , both equally straight , but he saw two of them ; and this terrified him , for he had never in his life known more than one straight line
1	opinions go through phases
1	a wart lives up her nose , so risky—true ;
1	the 'son et lumiere ' phenomenon has been followed most recently by the craze in museums as venues for live shows , though you would be hard- pressed to beat the calamitous night of the l\illennium , when the mists of the nile valley suddenly broke up a jean-michel j arre concert
1	in a word , fantine was known to have a child
1	all these questions that today remain unanswered make enigmas of contemporary ethics and aesthetics
1	how long have you been back ?
1	his shirt of coarse yellow twill , fastened at the neck with a small silver anchor , gaped open , exposing his hairy chest ; he had a cravat that looked like twisted rope , trousers of blue drill , worn out and threadbare , with one knee frayed white and one knee in holes , a tattered old grey peasant ’ s smock , with one elbow patched with a bit of green sheeting sewn on with string ; on his back , a brand-new soldier ’ s knapsack crammed to bursting and tightly buckled up ; in his hand , an enormous knotted stick ; on his stockingless feet , hobnailed shoes
1	by saying no to progress , it is not the future they condemn , it is themselves
1	the convict is no longer the like of the living , so to speak
1	the clamour of visits and congratulations does not begin till later
1	now and then , a glimmer of light flashed in those dizzying depths and dimly snaked along , the water having the power , on the blackest of nights , to take the light who knows where and turn it into a death adder
1	any allusion to that old rotter g—— caused him to lapse into a strange meditative trance
1	ushers , said the president , call the room to order
1	the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism
1	this is how he posed the problem of his life : to work as little as possible at material work in order to work as much as possible at immaterial work ; in other words , to give a few hours to real life and to pour the rest into infinity
1	in front of the camera lens
1	the unbelievably generous squabbling began again
1	sometimes he came on his own
1	my name is cosette
1	it was no longer montfermeil , it was the open country
1	at the word monsieur , the man turned around
1	cosette was dreaming forlornly , for , although she was only eight years old , she had already suffered so much that she dreamed with the mournful air of an old woman
1	as soon as he gets home , his mother says : oh , lord !
1	theatres are like upside-down ships with the hold on top
1	you ’ re much better off with him than with me
1	his bedroom was fairly big and fairly hard to heat up in winter
1	her maternity ended there , her hatred of the human race began with her sons
1	he was a brazen bastard
1	it ’ s rather urgent to go and have a word with them—a firm word
1	he chatted volubly ; he had recovered the excitement of the disembarkation of march number , when he pointed out to the grand maréchal the enthusiastic peasants of the juan gulf , shouting : there you go , bertrand , here ’ s some reinforcements , already !
1	but , of course , it did so after its own fashion , as a double agent faithful to two masters : the one behind the camera who actively directs the shot , and the one in front of the camera who passively directs the camera 's passivity
1	now and then she lifted her eyes up to the man with a sort of inexpressible tranquillity and abandon
1	it took him nearly a quarter of an hour to get back to the garden shed
1	my dear mayor , said the bishop , isn ’ t that just the point ?
1	mother plutarch doesn ’ t mind explaining a phenomenon
1	that the incommutable , the direct , the correct , the geometric , the passive , the perfect , could bend !
1	he behaved like the great captains at the decisive moment that they alone know how to recognize
1	wonderful chestnut hair streaked with gold , a forehead that looked made of marble , cheeks that looked made of rose petals , a pale incarnadine , a flushed whiteness , an exquisite mouth with a smile like a flash of light and a voice that was sheer music , a head that raphael would have given mary , placed on a neck that jean goujonnumber would have given venus
1	as they walked along , the burgher said to him : if monsieur is hoping to sit in on a trial , he ’ s a bit late
1	on the contrary , her state seemed to worsen from one week to the next
1	at around five o ’ clock , toussaint , who was bustling about , very busy with this little move , had laid out cold chicken on the dining table , which cosette , out of deference to her father , had consented to look at
1	it was only after a couple of hours that she snapped out of her reverie and cried : heavens !
1	fantine moved away from the door and watched in stupefaction as he went past her
1	an onlooker able to see him and observe him in that instant would no doubt have imagined that the letter seemed most curious to him , for he couldn ’ t take his eyes off it and read it over and over again
1	monsieur fauchelevent was not there
1	once the province of advertising , this adage surely now belongs to the realm of art , the desire to consume yielding to the desire to rape or kill
1	he acknowledged that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished
1	a convict and a prostitute
1	he had approached and registered that it was a very young child , loaded with an enormous bucket of water
1	strip the straw off the chair !
1	they were breaking the law
1	knowingness of the young !
1	rust had coated the wheels , rims , hubs , axle , and shaft with a layer of mud—a hideous yellowish distemper not unlike the colour wash deliberately applied to cathedrals
1	just as he had done that morning , he watched the trees go by , the thatched roofs , the fields under cultivation , and the vanishing stretches of the landscape shifting at every bend in the road
1	asking myself all those questions in the days when i was so poor !
1	jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys
1	the four paws of the jackal are just right for certain purposes
1	every day , he left his place at the same time , he set out on the same route , but he no longer finished it and , without perhaps realizing it , he made it shorter and shorter all the time
1	the finite , which allows that sublime travail , progress , is not something they ever think about
1	he stood them to ten sous ’ worth of wine and said : you got a job ?
1	and so , june number , on a day of mixed rain and sunshine , general lamarque ’ s funeral procession crossed paris with all official military pomp and state , somewhat enhanced as a precautionary measure
1	you are the child !
1	she sent the forty francs to montfermeil
1	he barked at marius , without adding monsieur
1	the good lord consulted his book of due dates
1	to save yourself by using what has sunk you , that is the masterpiece of a great man ; gavroche was able to sum up the whole situation at a glance
1	the wall was capped by flat stone without any zigzagging chevrons
1	cosette , you see your little dress , over there on the bed ?
1	that door is walled up now !
1	and she turned to marius : my brother ’ s here
1	you would have said it looked like a spider coming to grab a fly ; only here the spider was bringing life , not death
1	if a giant had sifted through this cloaca , he would have collected the riches of centuries in his sieve
1	they need someone to talk to them about the good lord from time to time
1	as soon as they realize that they are starting to become attached to this object , they must give it away
1	the desperate gaze of jean valjean lit on the lamppost in the cul-de-sac genrot
1	and yet , we might just say in passing , there is still a gulf between this species of men and the murderous city-dwelling criminal
1	in the twinkling of an eye , montparnasse had become unrecognizable
1	you know very well they won ’ t give me any
1	you never notice me , but i know you , monsieur marius
1	the faubourg saint-germain and the pavillon marsannumber wanted monsieur delavaunumber as chief of police because of his devoutness
1	in so doing , they threatcn science itself with disappearance
1	but he could not resist that mysterious and imperious rush of blood to the head we might name the call of the abyss
1	then he began to amuse himself
1	marius , who was perhaps dead , weighed heavily as inert bodies do
1	at the back , through a glass door , you could see two tiny , very white twin beds
1	of course , i approve of politial opinions , but some people just don ’ t know where to draw the line
1	one afternoon—it was one of the first days of april , already hot , still fresh , that time of the year when the sun is so jaunty , the gardens around marius and cosette ’ s windows seemed visibly to be waking up , the hawthorn was about to break out , a jewelled array of wallflowers was spreading out over the old walls , pink snapdragons yawned in the cracks between the stones , lovely little daisies and buttercups were just starting to push up through the grass , white butterflies made their first appearance of the year , and the wind , that fiddler at life ’ s eternal wedding , tried out in the trees the first notes of that great dawn symphony the old poets used to call renewal—marius said to cosette : we said we ’ d go back and see our garden in the rue plumet
1	on the other hand , the two letters uf
1	dead if i fall , nabbed if i stay put
1	a bit of skirt
1	from the saint-jacques church ?
1	they said in the village : it ’ s clear the devil has made an appearance
1	the old man on the bed , apparently half-drunk , got off the pallet and staggered over with a road-mender ’ s hammer in his hand
1	he lapsed into silence , then went on : number number–number
1	the gentlemen of the jury will take this into account
1	the initial commotion caused by amazement gave way to a sepulchral silence
1	there are certain mechanical motions that come to us , even unwittingly , from our deepest thoughts
1	the ideal is terrifying to see thus lost in the depths , small , isolated , imperceptible , brilliant but surrounded by all those great black threats monstrously banked up around it ; yet no more in danger than a star in the gob of the clouds
1	when the earth is surfeited , there are mysterious wailings from the shadows that the abyss picks up
1	that evening , since he was forced to head out the following morning , he turned up at the distillery foreman ’ s and asked for his pay
1	he gave me you
1	the man with the buttoned-up coat walked to the very end of the embankment and stayed there a moment lost in thought , wildly clenching and unclenching his fists , his eyes darting about like a ferret ’ s
1	monsieur le duc d ’ angoulême , number one of his majesty charles ix ’ s bastards , got married when he was eighty-five to a ninny of fifteen ; when monsieur virginal , marquis d ’ alluye , brother of the cardinal de sourdis , archbishop of bordeaux , was eighty-three , he had a son with a chambermaid attached to president jacquin ’ s wife , a real love child who became a knight of maltanumber and a knighted councillor of state ; one of the great men of the century , the abbé taranbaud , is the son of a man who was eighty-seven years old at the time
1	the victim ’ s desperate bid to escape , far from exasperating thénardier , had calmed him down
1	brevet , said the president , you were sentenced for a heinous crime and you can not take the oath …
1	jean valjean was hungry and thirsty ; thirsty , especially ; and that place , like the sea , is full of water that can ’ t be drunk
1	he had lost them the way you lose your hankie
1	there was , during the first quarter of the current century , in montfermeil , near paris , a kind of greasy spoon that no longer exists today
1	it is hate without exception
1	the idea was this : it ’ s not yet midnight , the rue de l ’ homme-armé isn ’ t far , i ’ ll take the letter there right away and i ’ ll be back in plenty of timenumber
1	the horrifying no longer horrifies
1	so why did the aes- thetics of the animated image suddenly disable the viewer of silent films , rendering strangely deaf a person hi therto not deaf in the slightest ?
1	incorruptible by sacristans , by whippers-in , or by dancers ; this had something to do with his popularity with the bourgeoisie
1	as for the priests , these were the abbé halma , the same to whom monsieur larose , his collaborator at the foudre , said : bah !
1	we have actually seen a note addressed by the then-reigning pope , leo xii , number to one of his relatives , a monsignor in the nuncio ’ s residence in paris with the same name as himself , della genga ; in it can be read these lines : it appears that in a convent in paris there is an excellent gardener who is a saintly man , known as fauvent
1	apart from the political chitchat , the main topics of which were the spanish war and monsieur le duc d ’ angoulême , you could hear in the racket perfectly local brackets such as these : around nanterre and suresnes they ’ ve had a good yield of wine
1	what you are quietly drinking , mesdames , is madeira , don ’ t you know , from the coural das freiras vineyard , which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above sea level !
1	one day , at a liquor seller in the lenoir market , a man with a thick collar of a beard and an italian accent hopped up on a milestone and read out loud an odd text that seemed to emanate from some occult power
1	we ’ ve got the heart , but no work !
1	the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily onto one of the pallets
1	he reached the top of the ruin , straddled the wall like a horse , and firmly knotted the rope to the upper crosspiece of the window frame
1	remember the 'thousand hills radio ' of the great lakes region of africa calling rwandans to inter-ethnic genocide ?
1	his father himself was fading somewhat from his heart beneath the splendour of his love
1	it ’ s only natural that a man make a bit of a racket when he finds himself with individuals who don ’ t exactly inspire sufficient confidence
1	what was he to do ?
1	well , then , go you halves
1	the old man would taste its bitterness
1	he was wrong above all in playing this dreadful and puerile game of holding him by a thread at arm ’ s length and keeping him dangling , once he had found the scent again on the pont d ’ austerlitz
1	her heart gave a slight lurch , but she scarcely registered it , immediately distracted as she was by a kiss from marius
1	it is not known where jean valjean has hidden this sum since his return to toulon jail
1	well then , father , said marius
1	i ’ m going to try something
1	they are yours , jean valjean cut in
1	here he broke off , the pen fell from his fingers , one of those desperate sobs came over him that sometimes rose up from the very depths of his being , the poor man took his head in his hands and brooded
1	he was the only one to know about the secret trust
1	then , sobbing all the while , he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though patting seven heads at different heights and through this gesture you could guess that whatever it was he had done , he had done it to feed and clothe seven small children
1	father fauvent , i had you called
1	which was merely a perfectly logical consequence of the change that had been effected in him , a change in which everything revolved around his father
1	hens were scattering dust with their beaks
1	only the birds could see this curiosity
1	he had hold of both arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other
1	with the children dead , the endowment was buried
1	inspector javert , replied monsieur madeleine , the highest form of justice is one ’ s conscience
1	enjolras thought for a few seconds before making the gesture of a man who has made up his mind
1	and the very play of the junction and disjunction of exemplum and historia will , in the twentieth century , allow painting to play around with its ideological programmes
1	mademoiselle gillenormand , wise elder daughter that she was , managed to find a way of sparing the very best linen , while letting the old man think his wishes were respected
1	he had little love for his grandfather , whose frivolity and cynicism rubbed him the wrong way , and his heart was dark in relation to his father
1	these creatures belonged to that mongrel class composed of commoners who have risen and intelligent people who have fallen , which lies somewhere between the class known as middle and the class known as lower , and which combines some of the defects of the second with almost all the vices of the first , without having the generous impulse of the worker or the honest respectability of the bourgeois
1	it ’ s icicaille , said one
1	thénardier walked slowly round the table , opened the drawer , and took out the knife
1	the cannons were bogged right up to their hubs
1	but who cares , long live joy !
1	at night a dreamy vapour rose from the garden and enveloped it ; a shroud of mist , a calm celestial sadness covered it ; that intensely intoxicating smell of honeysuckle and wild morning glory wafted up on all sides like an exquisite and subtle poison ; you could hear the final calls of the tree creepers and the wagtails dozing off under the branches ; you could feel the sacred intimacy of bird and tree ; of a day , the wings rejoice the leaves , of a night , the leaves protect the wings
1	there had been many days of fasting
1	the tumultuous give-and-take of all these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl
1	only , he felt that , whatever side he opted for , necessarily and without his being able to escape it , something of himself would die ; that he was entering a tomb , and whether he took the left turn or the right , he would undergo the final agony of death , the demise of his happiness or the demise of his virtue
1	the most dissatisfied , the most irate , the most tremulous , embraced it
1	bruneseau held up his lantern and examined this shred
1	he had the reputation of not backing away from anything and it was known that he had one day , out of sheer bravado , done over a police station
1	every year she solemnly renewed her vows and , at the moment of taking the oath , she would say to the priest : monseigneur saint francis chucked it to monseigneur saint julien , monseigneur saint julien chucked it to monseigneur saint eusebius , monseigneur saint eusebius chucked it to monseigneur saint procopius , etc , etc , just as i chuck it to you , father
1	it ’ s funny how you can suffer like that
1	when the little nipper ’ s fierce clamour got too much : your son ’ s squealing , thénardier would say
1	the insurgents had also been careful not to light any light in the upstairs rooms
1	now and then the young villain , vigorous and deft , thrashed around like an animal caught in a trap
1	no porte cochère could have been more ordinary , half a century ago , than the porte cochère of no
1	be serious , said enjolras
1	catholic spain was more roman than rome itself
1	i have to confess i have not always loved you ; forgive me , please
1	these men , grouped together under various names but who could all go under the generic title of socialists , tried to drill through this rock and make the fresh running water of human felicity gush forth
1	would jean valjean be allowed to be stronger than the entire social order , to be free and he , javert , continue to eat the government ’ s bread !
1	was she expecting a visit ?
1	if one of my subordinates had done to me what i ’ ve done to you i would have declared him unworthy of the service and sent him packing
1	i am well and truly riled
1	self-interest , that ’ s man ’ s purpose in life
1	i ’ m suffocating just thinking about it
1	he himself did not really know
1	how come monsieur madeleine had managed to get in , with the walls that were there ?
1	someone ’ s gone to get one , replied a peasant
1	we don ’ t want any more of this rue de l ’ homme-armé
1	oysters , cheese , and ham , said laigle
1	the man went on
1	in number , there was only one nun left of the whole order ; today , the only thing left is a doll
1	next to the rights of man , or at least alongside them , there are the rights of the soul
1	well , go back all the same to the inn and take a fresh horse
1	the entire column was now no more than a projectile , the force gathered to crush the english crushed the french , the inexorable ravine could not surrender until it was filled , riders and horses rolled into it pell-mell , grinding each other , forming one flesh in this gulf , and when the pit was full of men still alive , they marched over them and the remainder followed suit
1	i put the rags in a basket , the scraps in a tub , the linen in me cupboard , the woolens in me chest of drawers , the old papers in a corner of the window , anything worth eating in me bowl , the bits of glass in the fireplace , the old shoes behind the door , and the bones under me bed
1	the voice that had called marius through the dying light to the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie sounded to him like the voice of destiny
1	at the same time that tired people demand rest , established facts demand guarantees
1	but there ’ s a better way and that ’ s gribeauval ’ s movable star
1	we ’ ve brought his son home for him
1	and then again , cosette , in whom the woman was beginning to dawn , was thrilled to be a baroness
1	hear me out , for i have the prudence of amphiaraüsnumber and the baldness of caesar
1	where , oh where have you gone ,
1	jean valjean ripped up his own shirt , bandaged the wounds as best he could and staunched the flowing blood ; then , bending over the still-unconscious and almost unbreathing marius in the twilit gloom , he glared at him with inexpressible hatred
1	he thought it might be useful to open it , for it might well contain the girls ’ address , if in fact it belonged to them , or at least the information necessary to restore it to whoever had lost it
1	in spite of the murmurs of protest , enjolras put his veto on the fifteen bottles and , so that no one would touch them and to make them more or less sacrosanct , he had them put under the table where old father mabeuf was lying
1	you can ’ t do that
1	fancy living in the mountains and not even having streetlamps !
1	marius had two reasons for clearing out so swiftly
1	no doubt he was off to sit for some exam
1	to have done all he had done only to come to this !
1	there were five missives , five tales , five names , five signatures , and a single signatory
1	normally it ends in the ocean that is revolution
1	and to the man with the cudgel : hello , babet
1	the ciceronian period , number barely adequate on the subject of verres , would lose its edge on caligula
1	what a turnup for the books !
1	the compression caused by the panthéon obliterated in this way , a century ago , a section of the vaults of montagne sainte-geneviève
1	no one knew who he was
1	but how in god ’ s name did you get here ?
1	please , my sweet marius , let me stay here with the two of you
1	in the face of those two lines , he felt a horrible giddiness ; he remained for a moment apparently crushed by the emotional shift that was happening inside him , he looked at marius ’ s note in a sort of drunken stupor ; he had before his eyes that splendour , the death of the hated being
1	the hour , the place , these memories of youth recalled , a few stars starting to twinkle in the sky , the funereal repose of those deserted streets , the imminence of the inexorable adventure gearing up , gave a pathetic charm to these lines murmured softly in the twilight by jean prouvaire , who , as we said before , was a very gentle poet
1	i tell you , the deal can ’ t fail , the long-haired one resumed
1	but this laboured breathing scarcely ruffled the ineffable serenity that was spread over her face , transfiguring her in her sleep
1	i said : hold on , i ’ ve got my little cosette at hand , i ’ ll give her to him , then he ’ ll have to love me a little , or tell me why not
1	you know the promise i made to you and i will keep it
1	it seems that , the very day he made his obscure entry into the small town of montreuil-sur-mer , as night was closing in on a cold december day , with a knapsack on his back and a thorn stick in his hand , a great fire had just broken out in the community hall
1	they could hop down into the well , too , and search it
1	the sheet of paper monsieur madeleine was holding slipped out of his hands , he looked up and , firmly holding javert ’ s eyes , he said in an indescribable tone : ah !
1	two or three times
1	except for genius , there was something of danton in cournet ; except for divinity , there was something of hercules in danton
1	he goes out in the rain , he walks in the water , he travels in winter
1	it was , indeed , a man who went past jean valjean ’ s room , this time without stopping
1	vintage clothes are all the rage , and the young women of my dotage dress like the old women of my childhood
1	he added that some kind of compensation was due to him
1	while he spoke , jondrette was looking away from monsieur leblanc , who was watching him closely
1	and i tell them : look at her
1	every pocket of the redingote seemed to hold supplies for use in unexpected emergencies
1	a convict , for god ’ s sake !
1	at the same moment , a tiny oblong parcel wrapped in blue paper fell from a coat pocket
1	and he added , fixing the conventionist with his eye : what about louis xvii ? number
1	after a moment , he asked : where do you live , little girl ?
1	madame victurnien spends thirty-five francs on morality
1	in normal times , to dissolve an anachronism and make it vanish , you only have to get it to spell out the year of our lord
1	he might have been around forty-six or forty-eight
1	i was at waterloo , you hear !
1	inseparable from the suicidal state of representa- tive democracies , the art of the twentieth century has never ceased dangerously anticipating - or at least
1	cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark
1	the son , too , had got there too late
1	it was thought they got together to thrash things out in a cabaret close to the point of saint-eustachenumber a man named aug—— , head of the tailors ’ benevolent society , rue mondétour , was thought to act as principal intermediary between the leaders and the faubourg saint-antoine
1	jean valjean ’ s footsteps made more of a noise than usual through the rooms
1	murder is even more of a crime here than elsewhere ; we are under the eye of the revolution , we are the priests of the republic , we are the sacramental hosts of duty and no one must be able to vilify our struggle
1	her lips responded to one man and her eyes responded to the other
1	can ’ t a person be forgiven for refusing in the end ?
1	so , our troubles are over !
1	the government got word one day that weapons had just been handed out in the faubourg along with two hundred thousand cartridges
1	what door did he decide to open ?
1	when he got back to his humble abode , which he fondly called his palace , he said to his sister , i ’ ve just been officiating pontifically
1	the little tramp—the gamin de paris—is the giant city ’ s dwarfnumber
1	yet javert sank a few questions , like probes , into thénardier ’ s story
1	he pulled his hands away
1	the worthy fruit-hawker had put a hundred questions to her without getting more for an answer than the same mournful glance
1	his aide-de-camp , gordon , had just fallen by his side
1	it sometimes happens that , from the depths of their anguish , their discouragement , their privation , their feverishness , their distress , their rankness , their ignorance , their darkness , that great desperado , the rabble , protests—even against principles , even against liberty , equality , and fraternity , even against universal elevation , even against the rule of all by all—and the plebs do battle with the people
1	in the united states , to take one example , the torturing of the human body by sharp instruments seems to have become the preferred image of advertising , accord- ing to the wall street journal of may
1	the faces of the men were the colour of dirt
1	to continue his voyage
1	darkness blankets those doomed civilizations
1	driver , he said , rue de l ’ homme-armé , number seven
1	it ’ s in that room that i nail the coffin
1	you don ’ t need me any more , men ?
1	till now , i ’ ve been thinking only of myself !
1	there was a noise at the door
1	you ’ ve got a wife who loves you
1	just as he was about to turn the corner into the rue plumet , he heard someone say quite close to him : good evening , monsieur marius
1	when his eyes were full to brimming , his tears ran down his livid cheeks and he said , almost stammering , in a low voice , to himself , his eyes lost in the depths : o you !
1	a huge cart was crossing the seine at the same time he was , going over to the right bank just as he was
1	and the sergeant ventured out of the station soundlessly
1	but what is this 'situation ' concealing if not the contraction of time ?
1	monsieur gillenormand ’ s garb was not the attire of louis xv , or even the attire of louis xvi ; it was the flamboyant getup of the incroyables , number those young dandy reactionaries of the directoire
1	at night , going to bed , i finded [ sic ] three angels lying on my bed , one at the foot , two at the head , the good virgin mary in the middle , who said to me to be going to bed , and don ’ t worry about nothing
1	at one point they were caught between two volleys of shot and copped the volley from the field gun en batterie which , the gunners not having any orders , had kept firing without interruption
1	very well , cosette replied
1	they ’ re not here anymore , replied jean valjean
1	he pulled her up : call me jean
1	where have all the beautiful girls gone ,
1	he had a real following toward the close of the last reign
1	didn ’ t he have another goal , a big one , the true one ?
1	i ’ d be like mademoiselle thingummy !
1	all kinds of phantoms haunt these long lonely passages ; everywhere putrefaction and miasma ; here and there a vent through which villon on the inside chats with rabelaisnumber on the outside
1	and after the police ?
1	further bad luck was to ensue
1	you are among the blessed
1	i ’ ve spent the night trying to persuade myself to do just that ; you are hearing my confession , and what i have come to tell you is so extraordinary that you have a right to hear it ; so , yes , i spent the night coming up with reasons , i came up with some very good reasons , i did all i could , naturally
1	i ’ m very pretty this morning
1	nobody had been able to give him any news of thénardier ; he was thought to have gone abroad
1	the marquis turned to him and said sharply , monseigneur , i have my own poor
1	argus snored all nightnumber
1	as for the fifty francs , she had taken them from a fund monsieur madeleine had entrusted to her for alms for the poor and for the relief of workers and which she did not have to account for
1	he was chirpy and gentle when he wanted to be
1	each square was a volcano attacked by a swarming cloud ; lava did battle with lightning
1	you could still see on the roof of the hôtel de cluny ’ s octagonal tower the little clapboard shed that had served as an observatory to messier , number naval astronomer to louis xvi
1	for some years , the romanian government had encouraged the spread of these apparatuses , which were supposed to allow their compatriots to busy themselves quietly recording their small private pleasures
1	the whole barricade had come running , then all had lined up in a circle at a distance , feeling it impossible to utter a word in the face of what they were about to see
1	he turned and a shaft of moonlight lit his face side-on and jean valjean recognized old fauchelevent
1	at filspierre ’ s they found cartridges and weapons
1	everything concurred in the tragic majesty of this supreme moment ; a thousand mysterious roaring sounds in the air , the breath of the armed masses set in motion in streets that could not be seen , the intermittent galloping of cavalry , the heavy rattling of artillery on the move , platoon fire and cannon fire crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris , the smoke from the battle rising all golden above the rooftops , unidentifiable , vaguely terrible cries in the distance , lightning flashes of menace everywhere , the tocsin of saint-merry that now sounded like sobbing , the sweetness of the season , the splendour of the sky full of sun and clouds , the beauty of the day , and the appalling silence of the houses
1	the two women occupied the upper storey
1	there were only two ways out
1	they were riveted in and they were left there
1	ah , right , you ’ re having a laugh
1	he had been a buffoon at bobèche ’ s and a clown at bobino ’ snumber he had played vaudeville at saint-mihiel
1	are we really going to die like this without eating ?
1	he was following a broad paved roadway between two rows of trees , which undulated over hills that rolled along , one after the other , lifting the road up and letting it fall , like enormous waves
1	night comes bearing down and he has been swimming for hours , his strength is almost gone ; the ship , that distant speck where once there were men , has faded from view ; he is alone in the dreadful crepuscular gulf , he goes under , he is getting stiff , he thrashes around , he feels the monstrous waves of the invisible below him , he calls out
1	not a truer word was spoken
1	she ’ s going to walk past !
1	evening had come ; night had almost closed in ; there was now only one small spot lit by the dying sun in all the endless sky , and that was the moon
1	his heart broke at that point and he burst into tears
1	she stuttered , pale as anything , red as anything , wanting to throw herself into marius ’ s arms yet not daring to , ashamed to love openly in front of all these people
1	and a shiver ran down his spine
1	then they barricaded the window downstairs and they held at the ready the iron crossbars that served to bar the tavern door from the inside at night
1	the bell warns them
1	each one has two bullets
1	the situation was appalling
1	that was their first tiff
1	once he got excited , he erupted , a sort of gaiety accentuated his enthusiasm and he was both laughing and lyrical : let ’ s not insult the gods , he was saying
1	i ’ m the gravedigger from the convent
1	a voice burst out in the smog , sharply cut off by another voice
1	on the long trip to cherbourg , charles x , having a round table cut into a square table , number seemed more worried about imperiled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy
1	not long after the date of the letter quoted above , the bishop did something , if the entire village is to be believed , even more risky than the trip through the mountains held by the bandits
1	a bourgeois looked like a flower , a marquis looked like a gem
1	below the lowest of men comes the convict
1	you follow discipline , you ’ re a slave to orders , you ’ re a man of scruple and duty ; you ’ d never leave your family in the lurch to go gallivanting about with some shameless creature
1	god knows better than we do what we need
1	the baby ’ s gone , my lady , what will i do ?
1	marius was now a handsome young man of medium height , with thick , jet black hair , a high , intelligent forehead , passionate flaring nostrils , a candid and calm look , and with something hard to define that was at once arrogant , thoughtful , and innocent shining from every pore
1	feeling himself to be unloved , he did not feel love , either
1	cosette paid attention to her toilette
1	whoever picks it up and breaks it open finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in the courtyard
1	the grandeurs of despair
1	the petrified look on the two nippers ’ faces made it necessary to give them a shock
1	the battle line wiggles and snakes around like a thread , trails of blood stream illogically , the fronts of the armies undulate , regiments coming in or leaving form capes and gulfs
1	messieurs , asked the porter , what is it you want ?
1	if he felt like staying home : perfect
1	on top of this , jean valjean knew that he had been delivered from javert
1	there are gusts of wind that speak more distinctly than others
1	if he ’ s a half-wit , it ’ s none of your business
1	just be happy , that ’ s all i ask
1	i ’ d like to see monsieur madeleine
1	what dangers you run , o noble souls !
1	he placed the sheet of paper in front of monsieur leblanc
1	there are encounters that bind us , there are random events that drive us to do our duty
1	one of the guards , who had a hook on the end of his club , made a show of stirring this pile of human refuse now and then
1	there are miraculous relationships between beings and things ; in this inexhaustible whole , from sun to aphid , no one looks down on anyone else ; everyone needs each other
1	but on the night of june number–number , they stripped the dead clean
1	what did they care ?
1	it appears she ’ s dying
1	that is exactly what happened
1	all of a sudden , he heard a voice that seemed to come from the street and that cried through the trees : monsieur marius !
1	finally , he hung his head , sighed in anguish , dropped his arms to his side and retraced his steps
1	there ’ s nothing wrong with my hand , he said
1	here we find the same line of thought as rene gimpel 's - only , deformed by the canadian socio- logist 's media-haunted ideology
1	he had got through the worst of it ; the defile was opening out a little before him
1	to see your father
1	i ’ d like to see that one
1	and now suddenly her mirror was chiming in with jean valjean and telling her : no , you ’ re not !
1	he refused the cross , he handed out sous to all the little beggars he met
1	it also felt as though he ’ d gone deaf in one minute flat
1	he still yearned to see her again , but he no longer hoped to
1	who ’ s to say i ’ m not a murderer ?
1	unlike moholy- nagy , who was already making tele-paint- ings twenty years earlier using the crank phone to issue instructions at a distance to a sign painter
1	the constitutionnel was constitutionalnumber the minervenumber spelled chateaubriand chateaubriant , like the steak , and that final t gave the bourgeoisie a lot of laughs at the great writer ’ s expense
1	and what if there had been someone else there !
1	let the peasant smock out a little at the seams and you have your monk ’ s frock
1	yet it remains a riot
1	jean valjean turned to face the man and said quickly in a voice no louder than a whisper : give me three days !
1	he pointed monsieur fauchelevent out to gavroche
1	there were stone benches here and there that looked black with moss
1	his indifference was loving
1	he was soon knee-deep in sludge and more than knee-deep in water
1	he himself took the letter to the post office in montreuil-sur-mer the following morning
1	some of his father ’ s old generals and old comrades had invited him , when they found out who he was , to come and see them , and monsieur marius had not refused
1	this was where they conferred
1	he was transported , trembling , panting ; suddenly , without knowing himself what had got into him and what impulse he was obeying , he stood up , stretched both arms out the window , stared into the darkness , the silence , tenebrous infinity , the eternal immensity , and he shouted : long live the emperor !
1	the man spotted one night by boulatruelle was jean valjean
1	i mean a horse that can do twenty leagues in a day
1	the poor little girl was passive and kept her mouth shut
1	the officer murmured , for there was still agony in his voice : who won the battle ?
1	it ’ s a love letter !
1	cosette , the time has come to tell you your mother ’ s name
1	he didn ’ t answer my question
1	thénardier pulled the trigger
1	would you like some german ?
1	the misery of a child is of interest to a mother , the misery of a young man is of interest to a young girl , the misery of an old man is of interest to nobody
1	and then , we insist , studying social deformities and infirmities and identifying them in order to cure them is not a job where choice is allowed
1	such attacks of justness and goodness are not given to vulgar natures
1	only , as he knew no one and could not spray his cards around to any porters , he stuck them in his pocket
1	here grantaire , after this fit of eloquence , had a well-earned fit of coughing
1	what do you expect me to do ?
1	the door shut again and darkness returned
1	but when he saw the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going off to the seven o ’ clock mass , he smelled a potential future candidate and resolved to outdo him ; he took on a jesuit confessor and went to high mass and to vespers
1	there was talk of a bad-looking prowler ; of how a dubious-looking tramp had popped up out of nowhere and was lurking in town somewhere and how you wouldn ’ t want to run into him in a dark alley if you were foolish enough to come home late that night
1	he straightened up and twisted round and rooted himself firmly on that support in a kind of fit of fury
1	the gravedigger ’ s a drunk and a friend of mine
1	fantine ’ s daughter was there
1	he accepted the commission , saying : just as you like , auntie
1	a phenomenon frequently observed
1	no , answered the porter
1	the old woman who had given her what we might call lessons in the art of poverty was a pious old maid named marguerite , who was devout in the good sense of the term , poor and charitable toward the poor and even toward the rich , and who knew just enough to be able to sign margeritte , and believed in god , which is the trick
1	the prime equality is equity
1	anyone who has leafed through old folios knows that in number , martin verga founded a bernardine-benedictine congregation , with the headquarters of the order at salamanca and a branch church at alcala
1	jean valjean did not move a muscle
1	so , the self-same night that petit-gavroche had picked up the two stray boys , brujon and gueulemer , who knew that babet had escaped that very morning and was waiting for them in the street along with montparnasse , quietly got out of bed and started to drill through the chimney flue that their beds touched with the nail brujon had found
1	a few drops of water , more or less , brought napoléon to his knees
1	during the afternoon that followed javert ’ s visit , monsieur madeleine went to see fantine as usual
1	cosette persisted , adding in a barely audible voice , hoarse with anguish : but he even drank a lot !
1	he ’ s fixed up all his charities
1	all that exists now being one great carnival , there is no carnival anymore
1	events and people were put on trial there
1	even the bridge over the durance at château-arnouxnumber can barely take a bullock-drawn cart
1	old man hucheloup was a good sport
1	by the same token so were people like ilse
1	in the first place , he was not entirely aware of its extent ; then , in his sick man ’ s daydreams , which were perhaps still feverish , he mistrusted sweetness of the sort as something new and strange aimed at bringing him to heel
1	there is a proverb :
1	he directed everything by a sort of invisible and continual magnetic action
1	what is it to get a slap in the face ?
1	at eight o ’ clock , the emperor was brought his breakfast
1	superficial observers would have taken as provincial what was merely old-fashioned
1	courfeyrac bent down to enjolras ’ ear : this is for your ears only , and i don ’ t want to dampen your enthusiasm
1	the image of the good-looking officer was reflected on the surface
1	is war less of a scourge than a riot is a calamity ?
1	there was no one there
1	this light made a kind of sinister star against the blackness of the door and the wall
1	it is this : the age in which cinema realizes its powers is also the period when a new science of history asserts itself in the face of the history chronicle , or history-as-chronicle – that factual ’ history that did the history of illustrious figures with the aid of the documents ’ of their secretaries , archivists and ambassadors – in short , with the documents of the illustrious figures ’ officials
1	as for what became of the treasure of embrun cathedral , it would embarrass us to be questioned on that score
1	they thought they were strong because the empire had been swept away before them like a theatre set
1	that a society may founder in the winds that rage over mankind has been known to happen more than once ; history is full of shipwrecks of peoples and empires ; customs , laws , religions , are all swept away , one fine day , by that unknown entity , the hurricane , as it passes
1	isn ’ t it enough that you know yourself ?
1	the prioress was sitting on the only chair in the visitors ’ room , waiting for fauchelevent
1	these men don ’ t recognize me !
1	he had fallen backward , the light from the two candlesticks shone on him ; his white face looked up at the sky , he let cosette and marius cover his hands with kisses ; he was dead
1	it is your soul that i am buying for you ; i am taking it away from black thoughts and from the spirit of perdition , and i am giving it to god
1	he chided himself many times over
1	everyone took the step forward that they had to take
1	a ray of light in the rathole
1	what ’ s that , my two cutters ?
1	if you bent over , you would easily have recognized a silver coin
1	you are unusual , i agree , it ’ s just like you , but people who have just married are granted a reprieve
1	he held an old hat in his hand
1	one thing was strange ; thénardier ’ s manner was not natural ; he didn ’ t look entirely at ease ; while he didn ’ t exactly affect an air of mystery , he kept his voice low ; from time to time he placed a finger over his mouth and murmured : sshhh !
1	when you ’ re mamselle nobody , you become madame everybody
1	he fixed a piercing eye on the stranger
1	the reduction of the universe to one single being , the expansion of one single being into god : that is what love is
1	listen , he continued , as if he had not quite understood , it ’ s not like that
1	when they see i ’ m perfectly calm , they ’ ll say : we must give her her little girl
1	let them carry on for a while
1	for his father , the emperor had only been the beloved captain you admire and to whom you devote yourself ; he was , for marius , something more
1	this was precisely the time that marius was gravitating seriously toward death and telling himself : if only i could see her one more time before i die !
1	we each have a mother , the earth
1	well , naturally i ’ ll hand them over !
1	the difference between this sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte ’ s represented ten years ’ expenses , from number to number the five years ’ stay in the convent had only cost five thousand francs
1	and , most poignantly , behind the pile of stones , in front of the tree with the zinc plaster , there was freshly dug dirt , a forgotten or abandoned pick , and a hole
1	the face had a rose in its mouth
1	he went back into the council chamber
1	he recalled that , in the intoxication of his love , in the rue plumet , for six or seven ecstatic weeks , he had not even spoken to cosette of the baffling drama that had taken place in the gorbeau slum , in which the victim had taken the odd course of keeping quiet during the struggle and of running away after it
1	these two beings , pure as spirits , told each other everything , their dreams , their euphorias , their ecstasies , their fantasies , their weaknesses , how they had adored each other from afar , how they had longed for each other , their despair when they no longer saw each other
1	is it ingratitude , though ?
1	the density of corpses was in proportion to the depth of the sunken road
1	but if the man was not jean valjean , and if the man was not a good old honest man of means , then he was probably some cunning old shyster up to his neck in the obscure web of paris crime , some dangerous gang leader , giving alms to hide his other talents—the oldest trick in the book
1	feuilly was a fan-maker , an orphan on both sides , who worked his fingers to the bone for his three francs a day and whose sole thought was to save the world
1	ordinary people do not view saintly acts with malice and they melted with admiration
1	listen , enjolras , still on the watch , suddenly cried , it seems to me that paris is waking up
1	i ’ ve been robbed like a man in the woods , but pathetically robbed
1	i don ’ t want anyone to cough at my place without my permission
1	so many treasures are lost
1	we better hang on to that kid
1	you wanted to be madame
1	but i know i ’ m only good for another three hours , at most
1	the child looked wild-eyed at that great star , which she did not know and which frightened her
1	he was almost annoyingly ubiquitous—no letup was possible with him around
1	her mother , who , as we will later see , had settled in montreuil-sur-mer , wrote , or to be more precise , got someone to write , every month in order to have news of her daughter
1	he ’ d recognize me , that ’ s for sure !
1	the apex of the a is mont-saint-jean and that is where wellington is ; the lower left-hand point is hougoumont and that is where reille is with jérôme bonaparte ; the lower right-hand point is la belle-alliance and that is where napoléon is
1	the morbid and unhealthy suspicions that had begun to take shape in marius ’ s mind evaporated
1	one year , during lent , a young vicar came to digne and preached eloquently enough in the cathedral
1	javert still had doubts , serious doubts ; and when in doubt , javert , scrupulous as he was , never collared any man
1	the collapse of the old society in france , the fall of his own family , the tragic scenes of ’ number , number which were , perhaps , even more frightening for émigrésnumber watching them from afar with the magnifying power of dread—did these things cause notions of renunciation and solitude to germinate in his mind ?
1	buddha went into its den and managed to convert the dragon
1	that ’ s right , said a young man to an older man
1	this monologue over , he turned toward marius and asked him , pinning him with a stare : would you be frightened ?
1	what i saw there were images from contemporary art and i found that absolutely terrifying
1	he came in and strode over to the bishop , giving him a military salute
1	this fact was now an established fact for the prosecution and could no longer be contested
1	the pavement was not as hard to him as his mother ’ s heart
1	there was no possible connection in his mind between that marius and this monsieur le baron pontmercy
1	the petit-picpus , which scarcely existed in any case and was never more than a rough attempt at a quartier , almost had the monastic look of a spanish town
1	but that was parlour talk
1	and his finger sought the trigger of the pistol
1	he would wait till the sky had painted itself black before showing himself , crawling out from some hole after dark and crawling back into it again before daybreak
1	since i ’ m telling you
1	anyone who did not know javert and who had seen him as he marched into the antechamber of the infirmary would not have had an inkling of what was afoot and would have thought he looked perfectly normal
1	what an amazing show !
1	one night when he came home , he saw his grandfather with a letter in his hand
1	marius was tormenting the butt of the pistol
1	the dormer window let in a ray of moonlight between two great blocks of shadow
1	in disturbing marius ’ s clothes , he had found in his pockets two things : the bread forgotten there since the day before and marius ’ s wallet
1	basque announced : monsieur thénard
1	it was a mistake ; but was it not necessary to consider the limited nature of the man ’ s intelligence ?
1	the being in the way of his destiny was about to disappear
1	an usher stood by the door that led to the courtroom
1	gavroche was not entirely without remorse on the letter score
1	when i visited the museum at auschvvitz , i stood in front of the display cases
1	every time he passed one of those secluded houses that sometimes sit right next to the road , he said to himself : you wouldn ’ t credit it , and yet , there are people in there sleeping !
1	they call those measures , for god ’ s sake !
1	v you are better off putting your money in a certain forest than leaving it with a certain notary
1	there is also some difference in the intensity of heat given off ; an insurrection is often a volcano , a riot is often a flash in the pan
1	they reserved all of it and paid for all of it in advance
1	the day this promethean travail is finished , when man will finally have harnessed to his will the triple chimera of antiquity—hydra , dragon , griffin—he will be master of water , fire , and air and he will be for the rest of animate creation what the ancient gods once were for him
1	alas , it ’ s always the same old story , there is nothing original anymore in the creator ’ s creation !
1	the sky had been covered the whole day
1	the overseer indicated to her that she had to clear out of the workshop pronto
1	what was strange was that she did not get lost
1	the torn bit of coat
1	every accursed race has laid down its deposit , every torment has dropped its stone , every heart has given its pebble
1	the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in we know not what thoughts
1	you did your culp for pretty trivial things
1	and he furnished himself with this explanation : it ’ s quite simple
1	courfeyrac , enjolras , jean prouvaire , combeferre , joly , bahorel , bossuet , all bundled out of the tavern in turmoil
1	so their raging agent
1	workers gathered at a fencing master ’ s who gave lessons in the rue de cotte
1	don ’ t let it happen again , ever !
1	he abused his servants with gusto and would say : ah , vermin !
1	every man and his dog was present
1	can ’ t you do something for a change !
1	but now we have our routine
1	the reality of the twentieth century , in its most extreme harshness , is something fiction can bear witness to
1	there are still human beings here below who can merrily open and shut the surprise box of paradox
1	the day was coming to a close
1	monsieur gillenormand usually went accompanied by his daughter , that elongated mademoiselle who had just turned forty and looked fifty , as well as by a beautiful little boy of seven , white , rosy , fresh-faced , with happy , trusting eyes , who never appeared in the salon without hearing voices buzzing around him : what a beautiful boy !
1	what struck fauchelevent as unbelievable was , we repeat , simple for jean valjean
1	the crowd shouted at him : father madeleine !
1	moved , replied the porter
1	that the engine driver of order , that the mechanic of authority , mounted on the blind iron horse of the straight and narrow , could be thrown by a shaft of light !
1	he was cold and his little fingers were numb and had trouble hanging on to the bit of paper
1	the old woman waited
1	now he saw it all clearly
1	gavroche insisted : what are you up to tonight , then ?
1	but i will have suffered
1	but nobody is perfect
1	it was clear that the gravedigger had desperately tried to track down his pass and had taken his frustration at losing it out on everything in the dump , including his pitcher and his wife
1	there is no room left ; every habit has been acquired
1	but someone else could easily have been there
1	ninth : it is a fact that every day , in the prefecture courtyard , one hears gendarmes recounting the interrogations of those held by the magistrates
1	the checked pattern of that brace kept coming back to him without letup
1	she had been reelected to a second term
1	cosette was a bit too off-colour to travel in winter
1	the wife went on
1	thénardier went on , scanning his sentence in the manner of a classical alexandrine : the-po-lice-off-i-cer-ja-vert-was-found-drown-ed-un-der-a-boat-at-the-pont-au-change
1	how many times , after some equivocation , after a bout of the treacherous and specious reasoning of self-interest , had he heard his angry conscience shout in his ear : it ’ s a setup !
1	now your work is mine
1	the third station , the one from seven o ’ clock in the evening , between la belle-alliance and la haie-sainte , is frightening ; still there today , it is a rather high mound behind which the guards had massed on a reverse slope of the plain
1	the current process does harm in trying to do good
1	today the sewer is clean , cold , upright , correct
1	he was rewarded for his conscientious anxiety as a spectator , for he was able to catch the following dialogue , which borrowed an indescribably tragic tone from the darkness
1	he is not worried
1	that evening , as he was undressing for bed , he felt in his coat pocket and came across the packet he had picked up on the boulevard
1	these encounters with strange children are one of the charms of the outskirts of paris , lovely and poignant at the same time
1	it is from that place , there , that i used to watch , for years , regularly every two or three months , a poor brave father who had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his son , because , for family reasons , he was prevented from doing so
1	the simplest things will overpower you
1	not being able to lift up the water pitcher , he tilted it painfully toward his mouth and gulped a mouthful down
1	his little brother drags an old broom around the apartment like a carrriage and says : giddyup !
1	you can come with me , if you want to
1	this simple man was enough for cosette ’ s mind , just as this wildly overgrown garden was enough for her eyes
1	you pick up , without understanding it , a hideous murmur that sounds almost like the human voice but is closer to some kind of howling than to speech
1	it was one of the graces mimicking a cat
1	it had its back to a strong stone house , which in those days was a property of the estate of nivelles and marked the intersection of the roads , a sixteenth-century pile so robust that the cannonballs ricocheted off it without making a dent
1	in the second , perpetuity ; the only hope , in the extremely distant future , that glimmer of freedom mankind calls death
1	for events as for people , the stock company ’ s not enough ; there have to be geniuses among people , and among events , revolutions
1	it keeps them busy
1	the poor bastard tries to sit down , to lie down , to crawl ; every move he makes buries him ; he straightens up , he sinks down ; he feels himself being engulfed ; he screams , implores , cries out to the clouds , wrings his hands , despairs
1	this village consists of a lone house
1	caps and bits of buckshot lay around on the tables next to the glasses of wine
1	what i like ’ , the painter said simply , is man making expansive gestures ’
1	he was not discouraged , though
1	it seems that this garden , created in the days of yore to hide dirty secrets , had transformed itself till it was fit for harbouring chaste secrets
1	this being crossed out saves me
1	the man replied calmly : put me in the stable
1	the multitudes have a tendency to accept whoever is master
1	ah , it ’ s funny , the things that happen !
1	the two mothers chatted for a few minutes in voices barely above a whisper in a corner of the visitors ’ room , then the prioress turned back and said : father fauvent , you will have another knee pad and bell
1	this manor was built by hugo , sire of somerel , the same man who endowed the sixth chaplaincy in the abbey of villers
1	was there a voice that whispered in his ear that he had just passed the most solemn moment of his destiny , that there was no longer a middle course for him ; that from now on , he would either be the best of men or he would be the worst of men ; that he now had to rise higher , so to speak , than the bishop or fall even lower than the galley slave ; that if he wanted to be good , he had to be an angel ; that if he wanted to stay bad , he had to be a monster from hell ?
1	then he started looking up in the air again
1	the day embraces the night here and says to it : i am going to die with you and you will be born again with me
1	a big , square , three-storey house made of bricks baked in the sun , each side of the square five hundred feet long , each floor set back twelve feet from the floor below so that every floor has a terrace in front of it that runs round the entire building ; at the centre an inner courtyard where the provisions and munitions are kept ; no windows , only loopholes , no door , only ladders , ladders to go up from the ground to the first terrace , and from the first to the second , and from the second to the third , ladders to go down into the inner courtyard ; no doors on the rooms , only trapdoors , no stairs to the rooms , only ladders ; at night , they shut the trapdoors , they take away the ladders , they level blunderbusses and carbines out the loopholes ; no means of gaining entry ; a house by day , a citadel by night , eight hundred inhabitants , and that ’ s the village for you
1	as for epidemics , we ’ ve had typhus this year , and two years ago we had miliary fever—up to a hundred were down with it at any one time
1	javert , you are a man of honour , and i value you
1	he seized him , so to speak , sized him up , in a single glance
1	how could he not turn his head the other way this time ?
1	we have more than once pointed out this characteristic feature of marius ’ s makeup as an individual
1	all this verbal delirium seems so oblivious of its own century and yet condescends to preach to the rest of the world in the name of freedom of artistic expression , even during a historical period that oversaw the setting up of the balance of terror along with the opening of the laboratories of a science that was gearing up to programme the end of the world- notably with the invention , in , of thermo- nuclear weapons
1	only , monsieur gillenormand said in a low voice , as though talking to himself : it ’ s that swashbuckler ’ s writing
1	you know , monsieur marius ?
1	pope pius vii , number who performed this coronation hot on the heels of that death , calmly blessed the fall as he had blessed the rise
1	five fewer , one more
1	she was of the confraternity of the virgin , number wore a white veil on certain feast days , mumbled special prayers , revered the holy blood , venerated the sacred heart , remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo jesuit altar in a chapel closed to the majority of the faithful , and let her soul soar there among little marble clouds and along great shafts of gilded wood
1	i ’ ll tell you what will happen
1	after a few moments , jean valjean raised his left hand slowly to his forehead and took off his cap , then let his arm fall back just as slowly , and with that he retreated into his thoughts , his cap in his left hand , his club in his right , his hair standing up on end over his savage head
1	the police know this , too , and it is in paris that they look for what they have lost elsewhere
1	and with staggering sweetness , gritting her teeth and baring them in a snarl , she hissed at jean valjean
1	he did not even think to
1	the service begins at midnight
1	the intelligence of representation then gives way to the stunned mullet effect of a 'presence ' that is not only weird , as in the days of surrealism , but insulting to the mind
1	the little girl hopped off the bed , shivering
1	let ’ s hit the street again , said gavroche
1	some twenty dead lay strewn about here and there over the pavement all the way down the street
1	two or three times she sent nicolette around to the rue de l ’ homme-armé to find out whether monsieur jean was back from his trip
1	to learn to read is to light a fire ; every syllable spelled out sparkles
1	the family had no bread
1	he felt a kind of rage , he knew not at whom
1	a ration of eau-de-vie was distributed all round
1	jean valjean felt around in his pockets
1	i knocked on every door
1	one of the vocal mothers was standing by her side with her veil down
1	fifteen sous , the man added
1	but at this ineffably wonderful moment in her life , the news was just a patch of shadow , a small dark cloud , and she felt so much joy that the cloud soon dissolved
1	these young people are getting married
1	besides , he had just noticed that the man talking to him had no hat and that inspired his confidence
1	i want to forget life
1	nothing but antitheses , abominations not even written in french !
1	it was monsieur madeleine
1	the wigmaker had naturally spoken to the veteran about the riot , then about general lamarque , and from lamarque they had come to the emperor
1	where will it end , this impiety of art , of the arts and crafts of this 'transfiguration ' that not only fulfils the dreams of the german expressionists but also those of the futurists , those 'hate-makers ' whose destructiveness hans magnus enzensberger has dissected
1	here ’ s the secret of her birth : one fine day , a gothic pygmalionnumber making cathedral gargoyles fell in love with one of them , the most horrible one
1	why do they twist words ?
1	then he looked at his cap , he looked at the ceiling , and was silent
1	would you like some history , finally ?
1	the old woman went and changed the note and scratched her old head
1	foy launched thunder , and your corsage
1	barely twenty months had gone by since the july revolution , and the year number had begunnumber with a look of imminent menace
1	to think he ’ ll be spending the night in a coach !
1	turned into a painting , today picasso has become a car
1	at three-thirty in the morning , he had shed one illusion ; the officers sent out as reconnaissance had told him that the enemy was not making a single move
1	she died at daybreak
1	that ’ s how well you know him !
1	to go back was to fall into javert ’ s hands
1	the name patron-minette probably derived from the time their work usually finished , dawn being the moment phantoms fade and the crooks break up
1	this sinister victory has been defeated by liberty
1	of him , too , as of paris , you could say that the two principles were having a face-off
1	this man was dressed in red , he was a convict ; he had the green cap of a lifer
1	all of a sudden , the clock rang out
1	when , in our fresh springtime hovel ,
1	you have to take great care with it , it ’ s a sly and savage thing ; if it catches a flap of your coat , the whole of you goes in
1	these gates thus turned inexorably on their hinges the instant the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalidesnumber if any gravedigger was caught lagging behind at that moment , his only resort for getting out was his gravedigger ’ s pass , provided by the administration of the funeral parlour
1	thoughts appeared on faces ; that was an appalling moment , revealing demons with their masks off , visible , savage souls laid completely bare
1	the place was buchenwald
1	when she came back , she said to marguerite , who was working next to her : so what is miliary fever , anyway ?
1	he fumbled in his pocket and strode , furious , over to thénardier , handing him , practically ramming into his face a fist filled with notes of five hundred francs and one thousand francs
1	this new old woman was called madame burgon and there was nothing remarkable about her life except for a dynasty of three parrots which had successively ruled her heart
1	where had they all gone ?
1	thank you , monsieur , said the boy
1	at that time , she said to a neighbour : bah !
1	a red glare , though , carved out against this black backdrop the high rooftops of the houses that blocked off the rue de la chanvrerie on the saint-eustache side
1	old man thénardier noted how enormous the cudgel was and how isolated the place
1	it is the compass of the unknown
1	papelotte was taken ; la haie-sainte was won
1	you don ’ t have a father or a mother anymore , so what ’ s going to happen to your three little brothers ?
1	they had strange heads
1	destiny let the irony pass
1	the cutting made by the sunken road was filled up with horses and riders all inextricably jumbled
1	there are swamps in india where the water looks weird , inexplicably quivering when there is no breeze , whipped up when it should be calm
1	cravatte held the mountains as far as arche and beyond
1	of course such powerful daydreams have their moral usefulness and it is only by such arduous roads that we can approach ideal perfection
1	it was the front-axle section of one of those log carriers used in lumber country to cart sawn timber and tree trunks
1	when he reached it , he wheeled round and said to javert in a voice that could hardly be heard : i advise you not to disturb me right now
1	the stupid bastard ’ s probably forgotten the address !
1	after conscientiously stoning the streetlamp in the rue du chaume , he came to the rue des vieilles-haudriettes , and not seeing any cat there , thought it a good opportunity to strike up a song
1	doing his dirty work !
1	mistakes make excellent projectiles
1	the porter lifted his head and said : is monsieur with the police ?
1	and there , another voice in the group shot back , you ’ ll be caught
1	whaddovit means : what of it ?
1	the nervous authorities held hanging over the menacing hordes twenty-four thousand soldiers in the town itself and thirty thousand in the suburbs
1	he reverted to living more and more on his own again , distraught , stricken , totally ruled by his inner anguish , crashing around in his pain like a wolf in a trap , searching everywhere for the missing girl , punch-drunk with love
1	v poverty , misery ’ s good neighbour
1	it was adolescence appearing to adolescence , a nightly dream turning into a novel yet remaining a dream , the desired phantom at last realized and made flesh but not yet having a name , or any wrong , or any stain , or any demand , or any defect ; in a word , the distant lover remaining ideal , a chimera given shape
1	and , so that nothing was missing from this ravishing face , the nose was not beautiful , it was pretty ; neither straight nor curved , neither italian nor greek ; it was a parisian nose par excellence , that is , somewhat witty , fine , irregular , and pure , enough to drive painters to despair and to charm poets
1	getting a look at a bit of a masquerade will set them up nicely
1	far from being slowed down by the singing , his pace picked up
1	after a few steps , javert turned round and shouted at jean valjean : i don ’ t like this
1	what ’ s the most beautiful malines lace compared to that !
1	what was obvious was that he was moved and deeply distressed
1	it was quite recent , the nicks were white in the old black mortar and a clump of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with fine fresh plaster
1	marius did as he was told ; she laid her head on his knees , and , without looking at him , she said : oh !
1	i really must be an idiot , he mused , not to have brought my gun—since i was going hunting !
1	what have you got against me ?
1	misery is my trousseau ,
1	you hop into bed , replied the man
1	the imperial family is passing by , surrounded by an escort of officers and dignitaries
1	i in which the way to enter a convent is dealt with
1	a terrible stink alerted him to where he was
1	one of his favourite curses was : par la pantoufloche de la pantouflochade !
1	we do no more than tell it like it was when we describe the awful carnage
1	what is your name ?
1	he took a deep breath
1	they never dried up
1	ah , yes , on the corner of whatsit street , i can see the shop
1	he breathed freely and filled his lungs for the first time since javert ’ s visit
1	in today ’ s civilization , still so incomplete , it is not so unusual to see such breakdowns , with families falling apart in the shadows , parents having little idea of what has become of their children and spilling their guts on the public highway
1	but the two armchairs had been moved away across the room next to the door
1	only , a civilizing people must remain a virile people
1	the two bridges , being so close to each other , increase the peril ; the water rushes mightily under the arches
1	so let ’ s make ourselves scarce
1	masks were to be seen all over the boulevard
1	you look sad and i want you to be happy
1	from this embracing of all sorrows springs faith
1	everything in life is constantly fleeing in a headlong rush ahead of us
1	oh , the wicked people !
1	almost at the same moment , on the other shoulder , the line going the other way toward the madeleine also stopped
1	meaning , there was a mattress , a cover , and an alcove with curtains
1	yet the altar remains , a rough wooden altar backing on a wall of rough-hewn stone
1	of a day , all ’ s clear and bright ,
1	it looked as though he worried a lot about others and very little about himself
1	the waves are torn and ripped to shreds by the wind and close in on him sickeningly ; the rolling abyss sweeps him away , all the tattered water whips around his head , a mob of waves spits at him , vague tunnels of water half-devour him ; every time he goes under , he glimpses sheer drops of unfathomable darkness ; weird unfamiliar plants seize him , bind his feet , pull him under ; he feels himself becoming one with the abyss , he is part of the foam , the waves toss him from one to the other , he gulps down bitterness , the spineless ocean is raring to drown him , the vastness toys with him , dragging out his last gasps
1	that is customary on such occasions
1	then they would resume their course
1	parents are not something you know much about
1	as for andy varhol , listen to him : 'the reason i am painting this way is because i want to be a machine
1	which means : in the past the kings always went off to be crowned
1	begging your pardon , monsieur , we have papa and maman , but we don ’ t know where they are
1	this matter is my business
1	and with that , she withdrew
1	three thousand combatants had been massacred in this barn
1	the problem with these chambers , which , as you see , are nothing like dungeons , is that they leave a body to ponder when they should be putting it to work
1	courfeyrac made them hand it over to him
1	it is no less adept at getting a solution to spring out of the bringing together of ideas than at producing a lesson out of the bringing together of facts ; and we can expect anything on the part of this mysterious power of progress which , one fine day , brings east and west face-to-face in the depths of a tomb and gets imams to converse with bonaparte inside the great pyramidnumber
1	that he ’ d run after it ?
1	once more he crossed the place du châtelet diagonally , regained the quai , and went back with automatic precision to the very spot he had left a quarter of an hour earlier ; he leaned there and found himself again in the same position on the same flagstone of the parapet
1	in prison , where fresh misdemeanors had led him once more , he had become some sort of gatekeeper
1	he broke the seal and read :
1	where the hell could monsieur le maire be off to ?
1	he called in hill , who was at merbe-braine , he called in chassé , who was in braine-l ’ alleud
1	silence vv as put on trial - in europe as in the united states
1	she was of this world where cuckoos and carriages
1	it seemed as if the walls were built with the deaf stones the scriptures speak of
1	i know you could never do anything that wasn ’ t honest and that you have always been a man of god
1	the letter folded , he remained lost in thought for a moment , grabbed his wallet again , opened it , and wrote with the same pencil on the first page these four lines :
1	some indefinable penance had purified the retreat
1	to go and make yourself a republican
1	the new bride must be surrounded by a swirling dream
1	when he got to the corner of the rue poichevert , he turned left and headed for the mairienumber he went in , then came out a quarter of an hour later
1	to set up a sense that we lack as a source of truth is a real blind man ’ s ploy
1	oh , if you only knew , i was chewing my shirt , it hurt so much !
1	just in the nick of time
1	javert pushed away the notebook the driver held out to him and said : how much do you need , being on standby and the trip itself included ?
1	coquettish into the bargain—out of innocence
1	another shopkeeper said : we ’ ll attack soon , i know
1	it needed high pay to persuade a mason to disappear into that fetid sap ; the well-sinker ’ s ladder thought twice before it plunged in ; a proverb had it that to go down into the sewer is to step into the grave ; and all sorts of hair-raising legends , as we said , once covered with horror that colossal sink ; dreaded putrescent swamp that bears the trace of the revolutions of the terrestrial globe just as it does the revolutions of men , and in which vestiges of all the cataclysms are to be found , from shells dating back to the flood right down to marat ’ s flap of rag
1	he would walk her to the luxembourg , to the least frequented allée , and every sunday he took her to mass , always at saint-jacques-du-haut-pas because it was far away
1	a woman who laughs is a treasure !
1	what was this man ?
1	inside , he wrote society off and felt himself turn wicked ; inside , he wrote providence off and felt himself turn impious
1	whence a welter of memories
1	you ’ re not a bad mousetrap with your two little ones
1	stunning face-on , delicate in profile , with her deep blue eyes , lustrous eyelids , small , beautifully high-arched feet , wrists and ankles admirably turned , white skin that showed , here and there , a bluish arborescence of veins , fresh young cheeks , the robust neck of the aegean juno , the nape firm and supple , shoulders modelled as though by coustou , number with a voluptuous hollow between them visible through the muslin ; a gaiety cooled by dreaminess ; sculptural and exquisite … that was fantine
1	the presence of a warship in a port has something indefinable that pulls the crowds and fills them with wonder
1	nothing to hang on to , no foothold
1	wouldn ’ t you say it ’ s holding this collar in such a way as to not let go of it ?
1	none of her dreams had gone as far as a man
1	george grosz was the sewing machine
1	there , at home , what do they do ?
1	i ’ ll find out tomorrow if that ’ s true , said mother thénardier , and if you ’ re lying , i ’ ll make you dance !
1	any badly thought-out attempt , any clumsy bid to assist , any wrong move could easily finish him off
1	big booming voice , but a good old fellow with it
1	to put the infinite below in touch with the infinite above , in thought—this is what we call prayer
1	the superb thing that england had going for it there , whether it likes it or not , was itself—not its captain , its army
1	nihilism has nowhere to go
1	like all children who , like the young tendrils of a vine , cling to everything , she had tried to love
1	she spent nights crying and worrying
1	père-lachaise , and don ’ t spare the horses !
1	and everyone bolted their doors as fast as they could
1	but the english looked irremediably weakened
1	the other one replied : i saw
1	the dampness of the stones and the sliminess of the floor meant they were useless as supports , for either hands or feet
1	it is dark in misfortune , it is darker still in crime ; these two darknesses together compose slang
1	the former convict brevet was wearing the black and grey jacket of the state penitentiaries
1	one day the boarders managed to steal this book and began to race through it avidly , their reading often interrupted by fear of being caught , which made them keep swiftly banging the volume shut
1	reinforced as he was , the very idea of resistance was out of the question , no matter how energetic or vigorous or desperate jean valjean might be
1	calm down , pet , she said
1	but the pressure of the incomprehensible , the incontestable , was so great he felt his skull cracking open
1	he hated wellington with a straightforward hate that pleased the masses ; and for seventeen years , scarcely paying any attention to intermediate events , he had magnificently maintained his sadness over waterloo
1	although he was poor , he had had the talent to amass , through patience , self-denial , and time , a precious collection of rare editions in all genres
1	the man headed for the inn , which was the best in the district
1	what you feel in those places , as we have shown with marius—and we will see the consequences—is both larger and smaller than life
1	with her hideous hands !
1	all the miasmas of the cloaca blend into the air the city breathes—hence its bad breath
1	azelma listened to éponine in wonder
1	this name , spoken in this tone , at this dark hour , in this unknown place , by this unknown man , made jean valjean jump back
1	not seeing people allows you to think of them as perfect in all kinds of ways
1	i just don ’ t get it
1	gavroche called out to him : come and join us , young man !
1	the right wing , as charras says , number was pulled back behind the centre
1	i ’ ve just thought of something
1	the staircase has two sections ; the english , besieged on the stairs and huddled on the steps at the top , cut away the lower steps , and these big slabs of bluestone form a heap in among the nettles
1	well , cosette , mother thénardier crooned in a voice that was dripping with the bitter honey of the spiteful woman , aren ’ t you going to take your doll ?
1	the gardener answered , his shovel over his shoulder , and in the most placid tone : it ’ s the riots
1	now , god can sign me out
1	anyone who saw me now would think something terrible had happened , for heaven ’ s sake !
1	the inventory of fixtures we are drawing up here is rigorously exact and will certainly stir up very precise memories in the minds of former residents of the quartier
1	at the corner of the street they stopped and engaged in this puzzling dialogue in muted voices :
1	there ’ s been a change of program
1	you hardly notice , an hour after a storm , that the beautiful bright day earlier shed tears
1	fissures then open into chasms
1	he calls and calls
1	he then returned to the mairie and was seen by the office boy there to examine carefully a road map of france that was hanging in his room
1	what an even greater thing , to love !
1	it occurred to him to look over the wall
1	and he added in a whisper : take a good look at him , woman !
1	the outside talus offered an inclined plane for the assailants to walk up
1	he had the courage to stick his forehead against the glass and watch to see if the thing moved
1	he put the wallet in his coat and then he called gavroche
1	they had not even spotted grantaire and the sergeant was getting ready to repeat the order : take aim !
1	to the great surprise of his observer , the hounded man did not take the ramp to the watering place
1	adonaïs passes through on his twelve-wheeled chariot of thunder and lightning ; silenus makes his entrance on his donkey
1	poor horse , sighed fantine
1	you ’ ve won over my grandfather , you go together well
1	from the dormer window on the third floor , the death ’ s head watched them steadily
1	don ’ t you go spending that hundred-sou piece
1	it seemed to him that somebody could see him
1	hence visions , suppositions , conjectures , novels sketched out , adventures yearned for , fantastic constructions , whole edifices built in the inner darkness of the mind , sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find their dwelling place as soon as the floodgates are opened and they are allowed inside
1	we ’ ll take the cart for the republic and we ’ ll leave the auvergnat to his monarchy
1	there is not one metaphor , not one etymological derivation of slang that does not contain a lesson
1	and he yelled at monsieur leblanc : jesus wept !
1	bahorel , about to retort to bossuet , had been taking up a favourite pose
1	i think i ’ d have done better to skip the onions
1	the expression in the eyes of this eight-year-old child was normally so forlorn and sometimes so tragic that it seemed , at certain moments , that she was in the process of turning into an idiot or a demon
1	gavroche , who was anything but discreet , listened in
1	madame magloire knew exactly what he was getting at , turned on her heel without a word , and a moment later the three extra place settings required by the bishop were gleaming on the tablecloth , symmetrically arranged in front of each of the three guests
1	courfeyrac had a father who was known as monsieur de courfeyrac
1	would you like my hat ?
1	from that point in time , anyone who wanted to see it needed to be quick about it
1	since he did not know the streets , he struck out again at random
1	and he barricaded himself away from everybody , the king included , if it came to that
1	monsieur le maire , for the good of the service , make an example of me
1	the poor old soul was a virgin
1	the victim of an assassination who gets away is more suspect than the assassin ; and it is likely that this character , such a precious haul for the bandits , was no less a good catch for the authorities
1	the plateau of mont-saint-jean was taken , taken back , taken again
1	their innocent faces shone in ravishment ; perfume wafting from a flowering shrub nearby sent fragrant emanations out to passersby , but it seemed to come from the little girls
1	well then , let him keep going
1	the reason is that right is , in fact , indestructible
1	i thought it must be romainville ( why romainville ?
1	the king has roquelaure , the people have paillassenumber the clown
1	as we just said , nobody knows
1	one morning , several days later , they were both sitting on the garden steps in bright sunshine—another infringement of the rules jean valjean seemed to impose , and of the habit of keeping to her room that sadness had caused cosette to adopt
1	we all have our quirks ; i would have liked to have got as far as dawn
1	the war of number , an attack on the generous spanish nation , was thus at the same time an attack on the french revolution
1	another one of your funny ideas !
1	exelmansnumber left the cortège
1	this word , which blazes along on all four feet , sums up in masterly onomatopoeia the whole of la fontaine ’ snumber wonderful line :
1	it is remarkable that éponine did not speak a word of slang
1	the wisest , the calmest , the deepest , set about slowly deciphering it , and when they finally turn up with their text , the job has long been done ; there are already twenty translations in the marketplace
1	he felt emptied , useless , cut off from his past life , demoted , dissolved
1	thénardier , knife in hand , was working out what to do
1	two of me would be better
1	he was able to take in his situation more and more
1	to such people , everything is hostile and suspect
1	but the others had stayed there
1	a sapper was backed up against a tall chimney stack and he looked to be there as a sentinel
1	the lower town , where he lived , had only one school , a nasty shack that was falling to ruins ; he had built two schools , one for girls , the other for boys
1	for such a light to go out was , of course , impossible
1	you would have said he looked like an old private tutor from a good house back home from the emigration
1	there was another silence
1	marius stammered : what does this mean ?
1	as he did so , his little boy ’ s face , at once so cheeky and serious , so mobile and so deep , so chirpy and so harrowing , reproduced all the grimaces of an old man that signify : ah , bah !
1	those rare dreamers , mysterious priests of the beautiful , who compare all things to perfection , would have glimpsed the sacred antique harmony in this little working-class miss through the transparency of parisian grace
1	that campaign over , having , as he said , made a bundle , he had opened a pothouse in montfermeil
1	to do the same trip ?
1	jean valjean did not answer
1	fauchelevent looked at the stranger
1	begin by telling me one thing
1	driver , he said , hôtel de la porte saint-jacques
1	they ’ re all at it
1	a low rush of whispering could be heard from the barricade , similar to the muttering of a hurrying priest whipping off a quick prayer
1	the animal alone acted
1	at intervals , the cry of a very young child , who was somewhere in the house , broke through the ambient noise of the tavern
1	i got them , replied fantine
1	but the boy had followed it with his eyes , and saw what happened
1	two swans meeting on the jungfraunumber
1	the cart driver was german and didn ’ t understand
1	here , marius , feel how cold his hand is !
1	in all that was recounted earlier , the reader no doubt recognized jean valjean even before thénardier did
1	but he would have had to open the window and he did not dare
1	you ask me why i ’ m speaking out ?
1	the barrière du maine , replied enjolras
1	since then he had made unbelievable efforts to pick up the scent and track him down in the black pit of misery where thénardier had disappeared
1	not on your nelly !
1	a veteran of the neighbouring barracks , peering through the fence , said : here ’ s spring in full dress , shouldering arms
1	who is to blame ?
1	those words brought fauchelevent completely back to reality , and to its urgency
1	why do you say vous to me ?
1	the crown prosecutor put him on notice that he would be prosecuted for illegal wearing of said decoration
1	at the end of the street , which was incredibly short , he found the way barred on the les halles side by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a dead end if he did not see , to right and left , two black trenches down which he could escape
1	it teaches us to separate the task of the historian ( doing history ) from the ideological mirage according to which mankind or the masses would supposedly make history
1	a young man like you should have nice stuff
1	you could see daylight through his bones , but nothing in his eyes
1	you can be immortal and lame ; witness vulcannumber you can be more than man and less than man
1	when it comes to distress and intelligence it is especially dangerous for the two extremes to meet
1	wherever she went , you felt the chill
1	and that ’ s the reason caesar dies
1	there was music there and dancing
1	the ventriloquist ’ s voice sang this couplet :
1	here is the note :
1	he was falling apart yet blooming
1	this speech released everyone ’ s thinking from the painful cloud of individual anguish
1	she would not have understood and she would have replied : how can i be blamed for something i can ’ t help and that i know nothing about ?
1	the horse ’ s trot , the harness bells , the wheels on the pavement , made a soft monotonous sound
1	miracles spring from graves
1	i ’ ve been in the clink
1	still singing , the child paused now and then to play jacks with a few coins he was carrying—his entire fortune , probably
1	she turned toward him with a stunned look
1	ravined , jagged , serrated , snarled , crenellated by an immense rip , buttressed by piles that were themselves bastions , thrusting out jutting headlands here and there , and powerfully backed by the two great promontories of the faubourg houses , it loomed like a cyclopean levee at the far end of the fearful square that witnessed july number nineteen barricades rose up in tiers throughout the dense streets behind this mother barricade
1	jean prouvaire was in love , cultivated a flower in a pot , played the flute , wrote poetry , loved the people , pitied womankind , wept for children , confused god and the future in the same trusting attitude , and blamed the revolution for having caused a royal head to roll , that of andré chéniernumber his voice was usually soft but would suddenly become manly
1	do you have a room ?
1	you ’ re not leaving us again
1	wait till there ’ s some action
1	it was at this point that she began to fall behind in payments to the thénardiers
1	will you open up , yes or no ?
1	since you need two hands to fold the letter , give it to me , i ’ ll fold it
1	so marius saw them practically every day , at the same time , for the first year
1	there , profound peace , absolute silence , night
1	in the dark it would have been hard to work out what this piece of iron was made for
1	and once they agreed on a price with the donkey man , they rode back via vanves and issy
1	a breath , almost like sighing , stirred the undergrowth
1	he had not seen him when he arrived
1	so it was you we bumped into last night when we were going past
1	the completion and self-elimination of art go together , because it is the very particularity of history as a fate-dealing power that , in it , any existing form aims for a completion that is identical to its own elimination
1	the old man turned to the boy
1	he straightened up and called out to the young man in the cabriolet : monsieur marius pontmercy !
1	listen , madeleine went on
1	i don ’ t need a father anymore !
1	it ’ s all even lighter wines than around here
1	little gavroche marched at the head singing this song at the top of his lungs , like a kind of bugler
1	he went home on foot , at midnight , in driving rain
1	then she saw something the like of which she had never seen even in the darkest days of her fever
1	he remembered the mothers of others but forgot his own
1	let ’ s not let ourselves be caught short
1	others were as public as possible and you can judge how reckless this was by this fragment of a statement submitted in one of the subsequent trials : where was the meeting held ?
1	if he let go ?
1	the second article , a bit more detailed , is taken from the journal de paris , same date
1	really , no one would guess your age
1	as we said earlier , the current network is no less than sixty leagues long
1	one shot in the air , at the ceiling , it doesn ’ t matter where
1	her whole person , pervaded by the joys of youth , by innocence and beauty , breathed a splendid melancholy
1	and what if the fourteenth of july did cost twenty million ?
1	the cause of all of this adolescent ’ s assaults was the desire to look slick and expensive
1	when he did so , his aim was infallible and it frightened people
1	and then , right bank , left bank , on the quais , along the boulevards , in the quartier latin , in the quartier around les halles , breathless men , workers , students , sectionaries , read proclamations and cried : to arms !
1	enjolras answered in a vibrant and haughty tone : french revolution
1	the city streets flooded with lights , green branches hanging over the doorsteps , the nations like sisters , men just , old men blessing children , the past loving the present , thinkers enjoying complete liberty , believers enjoying complete equality , for religion the sky , god a priest needing no intermediary , human conscience once more an altar , no more hatred , the fraternity of workshop and school , notoriety as penalty enough and as reward , work for all ; for all , the law , over all , peace , no more bloodshed , no more wars , mothers happy !
1	javert answered : take your revenge
1	all the problems that the socialists listed , aside from cosmogonic visions , dreams , and mysticism , can be reduced to two main problems :
1	she was indeed pretty
1	i ’ m here to help you
1	it adapts to its divine labour , without being put off , both the man who bounded over the alps and the poor doddering old invalid of father élyséenumber it makes use of the gout sufferer as it does of the conqueror ; the conqueror outside france , the gout sufferer inside
1	everybody ’ s kicked me out
1	plenty of fusils bearing the numbers of legions , not many hats , no cravats , lots of bare arms , a few pikes
1	there is only one thing left for you to do and that is to think of her so unwaveringly that she is forced to think of you
1	these two walls had been built by two men , one named cournet , the other barthélemynumber cournet made the barricade saint-antoine ; barthélemy the barricade du temple
1	he looked at the cloud
1	he refused to go and gawknumber at the emperor as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and declined to prescribe public prayers in his diocese for him during the hundred days
1	he felt a kind of religious horror at letting that shade into cosette ’ s thoughts and wheeling in the dead woman as a third party in their shared destiny
1	thénardier could smell that javert was still around ; a watched man has a scent that does not let him down ; he had to throw the bloodhound a bone
1	ten years ago , i didn ’ t know she existed
1	god , it ’ s as easy as winking to be good , the hard thing is to be just
1	marius stared at him : i know your extraordinary secret , just as i knew the name jean valjean , just as i know your name
1	and on that altar and in that glory , the two apotheoses merging , somewhere in the background , who knows how—perhaps behind a cloud for cosette , in a blaze for marius—there lay the ideal thing , the real thing , the rendezvous of the kiss and the dream , the nuptial pillow
1	no , god thought the same as you and i did , and he doesn ’ t change his mind
1	these instances of resemblance between the sewer and remorse had a good side ; they were warnings ; very badly received warnings , though , with the city fuming over its sludge having such gall and not accepting that what you dump can come back to haunt you
1	every revolution , being an ordinary achievement , contains within itself its legitimacy , which false revolutionaries sometimes dishonour , but which persists , even when sullied , which survives , even when soaked with blood
1	all in the name of freedom of expression , a freedom contemporary with the terrorist politics joseph goebbels described as 'the art of making
1	a cab rolls in english and yelps like a mutt in slang
1	he was enjoying the collapse of all his past pain and he was full of optimism
1	a general , said thénardier , lifting his head
1	as wood is very dear in digne , he ’ d had the bright idea of dividing the cow stable with a partition made of wooden boards and that way creating a sealed compartment for himself
1	paris wakes up , rubs its eyes , and says : what an idiot i am !
1	we just saw the head of the procession go by , joly and i
1	this reminded marius of what the poor sorry creature had come to his room for
1	sometimes the sewer of paris took it upon itself to overflow , as though this undervalued nile was suddenly rocked by anger
1	they were alone in the garden
1	but one day , his own strange manner appeared to attract monsieur madeleine ’ s attention
1	you look most dashing , my lord
1	precisely at that double no
1	under the folds of this veil of smoke , and thanks to his smallness , he was able to advance a fair way into the street without being seen
1	too bad about the crowd !
1	by her side , the water swirling in the bucket made circles that looked like snakes of white fire
1	is monsieur able to receive monsieur marius ?
1	do you know what ’ s at stake here ?
1	there ’ s plenty to fight against , don ’ t you think ?
1	bonaparte fallen seemed taller than napoléon on his feet
1	was it true that a former crook , buckled under the weight of his convictions , could straighten out and end up being in the right ?
1	the nocturnal rustling of the forest enveloped her completely
1	all the friends of the abc had gone , each on his way to his own task
1	no , it ’ s not , said jean valjean
1	when she heard her husband ’ s step , she turned over and said : you know i ’ m kicking cosette out the door tomorrow
1	paris is athens , rome , sybaris , jerusalem , pantin
1	large sums passed through his hands , but nothing could make him change his style of life in the slightest or get him to embellish his spartan existence by the faintest touch of the superfluous
1	it ’ s got no heart , that cold fish of a barber , he growled
1	their tendency toward putrescence is obvious , their stagnation is unhealthy , their fermentation makes people feverish and enfeebles them ; their proliferation turns into a biblical plague
1	this was done automatically , as a duty , and even with a certain gruffness on jean valjean ’ s part
1	one evening when jean valjean was passing by that way , without cosette , he saw the beggar at his usual spot under the lamp that had just been lit
1	the vocal mothers conferred together after each confession and inflicted the penance out loud
1	there was the ravine , unexpected , yawning , right at the horses ’ hooves , two fathoms deep between its twin banks
1	i ’ d go mad first , i ’ d die , i ’ d get sick , i ’ d throw myself in the river
1	the wounded were laid out on these mattresses
1	to be a vice and turn into a hand !
1	from the barricade , which he was still fairly close to , no one dared yell out to him to come back for fear of calling attention to him
1	ecclesiastes says : number all is vanity
1	certain nocturnal wading birds make similar silhouettes in the wetlands
1	the bourgeois is a miser , his wife is a prude ; your century is dire

1	he made it to paris
1	never expose yourself again to having your fellow man struck off
1	the minute he reminded him that his infamy deprived him of the right to take the oath , chenildieu raised his head and looked straight at the audience
1	as they left the theatre , he refused to look at the garter of a pretty milliner who was leaping over a gutter and when courfeyrac said , i wouldn ’ t mind adding that piece to my collection , he was very nearly appalled

1	so , he said , my mind ’ s made up !
1	monsieur le président , arrest me
1	to be prince égalité , to get around bearing the internal contradiction between the restoration and the revolution , to have the disturbing look of the revolutionary who becomes reassuring as the ruler , that was louis-philippe ’ s fortune in number ; never has a man adapted more completely to an event ; the one blurred into the other and the incarnation was carried off
1	in the course of the s and s , the painters of the wiener aktionisnus , or viennese actionism , vould follow this dictum to the 'letter , using their own bodies as the 'support surface ' of their art

1	their only resemblance lies in this shared practice of the ladies of the blessed sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga , just as there was a similarity in the study and glorification of all the mysteries concerning the infancy , life , and death of jesus christ and the blessed virgin mary , between another pair of orders that were very distinct and on occasion even hostile : the oratory of italy , set up in florence by philip di neri , and the oratory of france , set up in paris by pierre de bérullenumber the oratory in paris claimed precedence , philippe di neri being only a saint , whereas bérulle was a cardinal
1	that is how it goes with human nature
1	they ’ ll see a man in a smock and a cap filing past
1	jean valjean felt the blood rush to his heart
1	come in , monsieur , she said
1	i miss everything about them
1	at midday , the doctor came back , wrote out a few prescriptions , inquired as to whether monsieur le maire had turned up yet at the infirmary , and shook his head
1	the solving of everything by universal suffrage being an entirely modern development , and all history prior to this development being filled for four thousand years with the violated rights and suffering of peoples , each era of history brings with it what protest is thinkable to it
1	they had stayed good friends ; they were ready to help each other out in every possible way should the occasion arise ; but nothing more
1	cosette let out a heartrending cry
1	marius understood that probably , judging by their flight the night before , their breathlessness , their terror , and the words of slang that he had heard , these sorry girls were also practising all sorts of dark trades—and that the net result of the whole sordid business was two miserable beings who were neither children nor girls nor women , monsters of a sort at once foul and innocent , produced by dire poverty , smack in the middle of human society as we know it
1	gavroche spotted him : whassat ?
1	they couldn ’ t see anything , but they could hear all right
1	there is no mercy
1	there , beneath the outer silence , titanic struggles are taking place as in homer , mêlées of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms as in milton , visionary spirals as in dante
1	nothing could be more normal than such a phenomenon
1	for want of twenty-four sous , his joy , his happiness , his love , was slipping through his fingers !
1	other acts , even more audacious , were suspicious to the people because of their very audacity
1	otherwise , through his daughter azelma , whom he had set on the trail of the newly married couple of february number , and through his own digging , he had managed to find out a lot of things and , from the depths of his darkness , he had succeeded in seizing more than one mysterious thread
1	despite this favoured lancer , the label prude , under which we have classified her , suited her to a tee
1	to love beauty is to seek the light
1	except for enjolras and marius , who kept silent , everyone joined in the aimless ranting
1	there was an extra chair in the enclosed alcove , but half the straw seating was missing and it only had three legs to stand on , so that it could only be used propped up against a wall
1	the scaffold is a kind of monster manufactured by judge and carpenter together , a spectre that seems to have a kind of ghastly life of its own arising out of all the death it has dealt
1	the idyll of the rue plumet and the epic of the rue saint-denis
1	what is beyond doubt is that sister simplice , sole witness to what was happening , has often recounted that the moment jean valjean whispered in fantine ’ s ear , she distinctly saw a heavenly smile form on those pale lips and in those dull pupils , full of the wonder of the grave
1	about a quarter of an hour elapsed
1	behind the door of this room , there was a man standing against the wall
1	when his aunt scolded him for this , he was very sweet and gave as an excuse his studies , courses , exams , symposia , and so on
1	he must be punished
1	at first the sisters had taken in and cared for that girl only with repugnance
1	this mongrel of very mixed blood was , in all probability , some kind of fleming from lille in flanders , french in paris , belgian in brussels , conveniently straddling two borders , with a foot in both camps
1	extreme emotions often speak out loud
1	not a voice rose , not an arm shot out to stop him
1	the fates are truly fatal for some and too profliget or too protectiv for others
1	there are four categories of them
1	this patch of dirt would perhaps have brought him the world , if only he had been able to take it
1	these two figures were not known to him
1	the fate of many a man is to live half submerged in this way
1	surely someone in this place can sell me a saddle
1	there ’ s enough here for four , anyway
1	digne was a particularly exhausting diocese to tour
1	she was so gentle she seemed fragile , but was actually the opposite , solid as a rock
1	at times he would say , i ’ m eighty-four , though , as if he had some lingering hope of coming to the end of his days before coming to the end of his books
1	let this be a lesson to you , you peddler of secrets , mystery merchant , rummager in the dark , miserable bastard !
1	cosette and marius saw each other again
1	you know , sorry , i ’ m not saying that right , but you know , for me , it ’ s all so far away ! —you know what we ’ re like , us lot !
1	a light flashed in her glassy eyes
1	he had a pick somewhere among the briars in a hiding place he alone knew about
1	feuilly , a drawn sabre in his hand , was marching in front crying : long live poland ! number
1	his mother would say to him : what the hell ’ d you come here for ?
1	if every object immediately has the potential to become subject , form or material , this is not only , as has sometimes been suggested a bit too hastily in the age of pop , because of its documentary ’ value , which turns it into a vehicle of a critical function
1	oh , look how happy he is !
1	you pushed it and you found yourself in a small room about six feet square , tiled , washed and scrubbed , clean and neat , cold , and hung with nankeen wallpaper with little green flowers at fifteen sous a roll
1	until that moment she had been happy just to see him go by on the boulevard without even trying to run into him
1	what is your occupation ?
1	a mother would have told her , for instance , that a young girl does not wear damask
1	of course , but it will take at least two or three days
1	and marius , pulling a banknote out of his pocket , threw it in his face
1	then he shook the worker ’ s hand and went on his way , saying : we ’ ll see each other again soon
1	to say that , to do that , to come up with that—this is to be the victor
1	if it had occurred to them to split into two squads and cover both directions at once , jean valjean would have been caught
1	marius felt a piece of paper there
1	but i need money
1	he seemed to be there to goad everyone else on
1	he lives … actually , he doesn ’ t live there anymore … ah , well , i don ’ t know
1	he went over to his bed , and his eyes fell—was it by chance ?
1	meanwhile , at that very moment , fantine was delirious with joy
1	one of these proclamations was signed : burtot , wine seller
1	on top of this , he had on him his watch and his purse , which contained a few gold coins
1	jean valjean sized up the wall above which he could see the linden tree
1	he turned and went on his way again , singing this song :
1	violent resistance ; conclusion , refusal
1	one possibility opened up the prospect , beyond jail , of the death penalty , if his identity was established and if the petit-gervais matter were to end up resulting in a conviction
1	i ’ ll be needing you
1	is that really what we are shown in the smile of the old peasant who joined the kolkhoz , the collective farm , the day it was set up , did ten years in a gulag sawing tree trunks , and merely says , here i live and that 's all there is to it ’ ?
1	he caught her , she fell , he caught her in his arms , he squeezed her tight without knowing what he was doing
1	i repeat , we ’ re talking about women here , we ’ re talking about mothers , we ’ re talking about girls , we ’ re talking about little nippers
1	those women , too , were once pure
1	i resigned myself to it : they don ’ t need you , stay in your corner , a man doesn ’ t have the right to go on forever
1	these rooms looked out on the surrounding wastelands
1	to squint is highly rated
1	all this labour was carried out without hindrance in under an hour and without this handful of daring men seeing one fur cap or one bayonet emerge
1	he was a corpse with wings you could feel
1	what did jean valjean want ?
1	cosette had been through so much that she was afraid of everything , even to open her mouth , even to breathe
1	now that he was alone with his wife , jondrette resumed pacing the room and he circled it two or three times in silence
1	at times , this noise moved away , at times it came closer , wavering mournfully
1	today , with excess heaped on excess , desensitiza- tion to the shock of images and the meaninglessness of words has shattered the world stage
1	you see , be reasonable , there ’ s nothing left now , i feel absolutely sure that it ’ s over
1	besides , help was evidently on the way
1	but there are more bastilles left ,
1	the place was in fact exactly right with its funnel-shaped entrance from the street tapering at the bottom and ending in a dead end , where the corinthe caused a bottleneck , the rue mondétour easily blocked off both left and right , and no attack possible except via the rue saint-denis , that is , from the front and without cover
1	so the relationship needs to be nuanced
1	in our time , these boisterous piles of creatures usually get themselves lugged about in some ancient contraption where they clutter the top deck , or they tumultuously overwhelm a government landau with its hood folded back
1	enthusiasm can lose its temper ; hence the taking up of arms
1	cannons , i tell you !
1	that was enough for him to live on
1	old toussaint , who went to bed early , thought only of sleeping once her chores were finished and was as much in the dark as jean valjean
1	i want the surprise !
1	i voted for fraternity , for harmony , for the dawn of a new age !
1	that same day , at around four o ’ clock in the afternoon , jean valjean was sitting alone on the shady side of one of the most solitary slopes in the champ de mars
1	we were only a few turns of the wheel from the little path that leads to the nuns ’ corner
1	the nightmare struck him so forcefully he later wrote it down
1	the flora of cauteretz was no longer selling at all—not a single copy
1	eighteen seventeen is the year that louis xviii , with a certain royal aplomb not devoid of arrogance , called the twenty-second year of his reignnumber it is the year monsieur bruguière de sorsum , number the translator of shakespeare , became famous
1	you can hear the broom of these spectres beneath these vaults
1	but also , first and foremost , by the horror of the laboratories of the extermination camps
1	had he actually reached the point of forgetting the mayor ’ s very presence ?
1	i should hope so , laigle retorted
1	and then , workers are a nasty lot !
1	audacity had already paid off for him once
1	communism and agrarian law think they have solved the second problem
1	'the lack of guidelines req uires us urgently to define an ethical boundary that would make clear what comes under theratv and what is out oj bounds '
1	it felt as though their souls had so merged that , if they had wanted to take them back again , they could not possibly have distinguished between them
1	and cosette would reply : i love you a little bit more with every passing minute this morning
1	she would scold him tenderly in that way that is so lovely coming from the daughter to the father
1	she spoke to him out of the corner of her mouth without turning round : by the way , you know you promised me something ?
1	besides , no one can keep a secret the way a child can
1	with their stocks so high , they shower those around them—overzealous sycophants and favourites alike and all the young men who ’ ve learned how to flatter them—with fat parishes , livings , archdeaconates , chaplaincies , and cathedral posts , as a prelude to episcopal honours
1	i am so serious that i absolutely will not accept your gendarmes and i will be off in an hour
1	i ’ ve come to see my ancestors
1	for them it was an endlessly novel joy to saunter out arm in arm into the sun , out into the street , without hiding , in front of everyone , the two of them together all on their own
1	this garden was on about an acre of land
1	jean valjean had perhaps been , without knowing it , fairly close to both that side and that bridge , when providence threw him into the petit-picpus convent
1	marius ’ s fury at ursula , as right and just as it was , blew over
1	the red , the reds !
1	this latter would agree with julia alpinula : number hic jaceo , vixi annos viginti et tres
1	ferocious things lurk on the horizon
1	how right i was not to believe that story about the lancer !
1	the six hundred thousand francs had been her latest surprise
1	senses and figures of history
1	in this struggle , glimpsed through the magnifying glass of terror , the two men seemed to her like giants ; one spoke like her demon , the other spoke like her good angel
1	the absolute has to be put into practice
1	love should last forever , like this !
1	she wafts into view , she goes along with you yet knows nothing about you ; she is the face of dishonour and severity
1	in this frame of mind , it was a gut-wrenching torment for marius to think that the man would have any further contact whatever with cosette
1	didn ’ t monsieur le maire ask for a tilbury ?
1	enjolras had a double-barrelled fowling piece , combeferre a national guard fusil bearing the number of the legion , as well as two pistols in his belt that his unbuttoned overcoat revealed , jean prouvaire an old cavalry carbine , bahorel a hunting rifle , and courfeyrac was waving around an unsheathed sword cane
1	it ’ s just like at the fair here , you pay as you go
1	meanwhile the man had taken off his cap and exclaimed , trembling all over : oh , my god !
1	let ’ s understand each other
1	wellington was firm , and the order was to put to death anyone caught in the act ; but plunder is tenacious
1	to mix a bit of the sepulchre into your life is the law of the sage ; and it is the law of the ascetic
1	she ’ d do it , too , said thénardier in an undertone to brujon and the ventriloquist
1	rrhe art of speaking has bowed out before the 'talking ' cinema and the oratorical power of the political tribune has been defeated by media culture
1	so it has a self
1	you gave me something to eat with , tell me now what ’ s the matter
1	these inner walls were even more tragic than the outside ones
1	now i am eighty-six years old ; i am about to die
1	but he does so rapidly and without a hint of bitterness or derision
1	he looked endlessly , he looked everywhere ; he found nothing
1	what a dismal thing not to know the address of one ’ s soul !
1	some twenty cartridge pouches for gavroche
1	it was obvious the man was finished
1	he had abandoned their customary spot and had adopted the seat next to the gladiator at the other end of the walk as though testing to see if marius would follow
1	the emperor henri ii , who fought the antipope gregory and reestablished benedict viii , has two nicknames : the saint and the limper
1	abbé sicard speaks of sister simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute massieunumber however sincere , however loyal and incorruptible we may be , we each have at least one crack in our candour formed by the innocent white lie
1	the wanderer pushed the door , elbowed his way past an old calash , and walked into the courtyard
1	you would have thought it was the mount of a giant cannon
1	he congratulated the defence counsel on his loyalty and cleverly took advantage of this loyalty
1	this old man is august in the eyes of his country
1	cosette did not stir
1	and of his own accord , the coward !
1	for cosette and marius nothing existed anymore except marius and cosette
1	so , with the assurance of a man who feels himself to be appreciated , the dear old man stood before the reverend prioress and launched into a bucolic address that was fairly rambling and extremely deep
1	bibere tiberum , id est seditionem obliviscinumber paris drinks a million litres of water a day , but that does not stop it from sounding the call to arms and ringing the tocsin on occasion
1	the manhole in the rue de la mortellerie was famous for the plagues that came out of it ; with its grate of pointy iron bars simulating a row of teeth , it was as deadly in that street as a dragon ’ s maw blowing hell over mankind
1	the little girl raised her great big eyes where tears were forming invisibly in the night , and she replied softly : yes , monsieur
1	this man was more or less a monster
1	so it 's not a matter of picturing the horror but of showing something that precisely has no natural ’ image – inhumanity , the process of negating humanity
1	what could he do ?
1	at the same time , marius heard below him , at the foot of the dividing wall , but so close that he couldn ’ t see them talking , this hushed exchange : there ’ s only one thing to do
1	the swans , seeing the enemy , stepped up the pace and in stepping up the pace , produced a kind of breastplate effect beneficial to the little fisherman ; the water in front of the swans flowed back , and one of these soft concentric ripples gently pushed the brioche toward the little boy ’ s stick
1	common right is nothing more nor less than the protection of all shining on the right of each
1	every thing has its true form , or at least its final form
1	there ’ s nothing more after that
1	and mounted the stairs
1	the innkeeper wasn ’ t able to make a break for it
1	when he had finished banging , he called out to cosette
1	monsieur madeleine did not let the counsel for the prosecution finish
1	what did episthates do ?
1	twenty different versions have come and gone between these two extremes
1	and all to save—who knows who ?
1	is your master up ?
1	no good can come of them
1	he was scandalized by all the names he saw in politics and in power , finding them crass and bourgeois
1	and the abandoned little boy would go on crying in the dark
1	what dunderheads they are !
1	we salute the philosopher in them , while at the same time inexorably qualifying their philosophy
1	is there an infinite outside ourselves ?
1	all these revolutions were accomplished in him without his family being any the wiser
1	no one will ever know
1	the sun is beautiful , isn ’ t it ?
1	midnight mass had been said , christmas eve was over , the drinkers had gone , the bar had closed , the low room was deserted , the fire had gone out , the stranger was still in the same place and in the same position
1	so who is it who sent you off at this hour to get water in the woods ?
1	they answered : we do , too
1	in one , the symbol is a sign that takes shape and makes sense through a ritual ; in the other , the symbol is a detached part of a whole , a static moment in a movement that both presents and signifies this movement at the same time
1	he definitely felt a little afraid
1	a notary ’ s affidavit was drawn up
1	bossuet was just saying to courfeyrac : seeing all these snowflakes falling you ’ d think there was a plague of white butterflies in the sky
1	they will follow this or that person for days at a time , while away the hours loitering on sundry street corners , under the arches of passageways , at night , in the cold and the rain , bribe desk attendants , get coach drivers and lackeys roaring drunk , buy off a chambermaid , put a porter in their pocket
1	if you have me arrested , my friend will finish off the lark
1	as he approached , the exit stood out more and more distinctly
1	the driver , by way of response , simply whistled the tune of la palisse and whipped his horse into action
1	but we don ’ t take the good lord into account
1	his supreme anguish was the evaporation of all certainty
1	isn ’ t this cause for despair ?
1	fantine was also decency
1	javert advanced slowly , poking around and scouring every nook and cranny in the street , like the pockets of a thief , along the way
1	the five men filed through the fence , one after the other
1	all he had left out of four swords—one more than françois i had at marignanonumber—was a stump
1	the fact is that she now hardly felt any of those sore spots once so burning
1	such things are lovely when you are full of joy and forlorn as can be when you are downhearted
1	and of the dean , monsieur delvincourt , number what a monument !
1	he would have his accomplices , his sidekicks , his bolt-holes where he could no doubt go to ground
1	madame magloire did not even have the strength to utter a cry
1	cosette occupied the main house along with the servant ; she had the master bedroom with the painted window piers , the boudoir with the gilded mouldings , the presiding judge ’ s salon furnished with tapestries and vast armchairs ; she had the garden
1	vve are familiar with extreme sports , in which the champion risks dea th s tri ving for some pain tless performance - 'going for it '
1	this woman , like many women of her ilk , had a set store of cuddles and a set store of wallops and foul language to dispense each day
1	you saw all those fireflies
1	the faubourg hides poignant cases of distress under mansard roofs ; there are also people of rare and ardent intelligence there
1	the wigmaker felt that after those words a small pause was appropriate , which he observed , and then resumed : the emperor was only ever wounded once , monsieur , isn ’ t that so ?
1	kahn concludes , 'everything in the history of human enterprise would indicate that this headlong rush into the future will one day end in cat-astrophies - in botched attempts at human beings , how can we fail here to denounce yet another facet of negationism : that of the deliberate over- looking of the fa
1	an hour ago , i fainted
1	jean valjean , without answering , helped the insurgent he had saved get into his uniform
1	without you i was dead !
1	you can see it
1	but someone other than me has to come back
1	resistance sprang up the day after ; maybe it sprang up the very same night
1	the other tenants had either moved or died , or had been evicted for not paying the rent
1	whereas , if he went ahead with his sacrifice and landed in jail , shackled to a post , in an iron collar , with a green cap , doing hard labour till the end of his days , in relentless shame , there would be a touch of paradise involved !
1	listen , be happy , be in seventh heaven , be an angel ’ s angel , live in the sun , and be satisfied with that , and don ’ t worry how a poor doomed man goes about getting things off his chest and doing his duty ; you have a most miserable man before you , monsieur
1	you ’ ve paid , now go
1	what do you mean by a good horse , anyway ?
1	on christmas eve itself , several men , carters and peddlers , were sitting at table , drinking , ranged around four or five candles in the low room of the thénardiers ’ inn
1	jean valjean had not cut out the strolls to the luxembourg , not wanting to do anything out of the ordinary and above all fearing to alert cosette to what was going on ; but during those hours that were so sweet for the two little lovebirds , while cosette sent her smile to the intoxicated marius , who saw nothing but that and now no longer saw anything else in this world but that one radiant and adored face , jean valjean fixed glittering and terrible eyes on marius
1	a horse to do the trip to arras in one go !
1	the battlefield by night
1	you must , i am a knight ,
1	he liked to carry a gun on his walks but he rarely used it
1	and she pointed a finger at cosette
1	replied fauchelevent , following her lead and making an effort to stick with it from now on
1	there are people who will go to great lengths to have influence and to be made a fuss of ; where they can ’ t be oracles , they turn themselves into buffoons
1	the revolution produced plenty of men like him , equal to the era
1	you are jean valjeannumber now would you like me to tell you what you are ?
1	suddenly she yelled : you ’ re talking about monsieur madeleine there !
1	yet it didn ’ t look like he had any broken limbs , and by a stroke of luck , if we may use such a term here , the bodies had arched above him in such a way as to prevent him from being crushed
1	marius , with cosette at his side , climbed the stairs , triumphant and beaming , the same stairs he had been dragged up half dead
1	one thing added further to the garret ’ s horror and that was that it was big
1	he wheeled round to javert : that ’ s enough , javert
1	this did not prevent him from making plan after plan , devising schemes , erecting scaffoldings , elaborating projects for the future
1	it was like an eruption
1	she suffered from marius ’ s absence just as she rejoiced in his presence , strangely , without really knowing she did so
1	she sold everything she had , which gave her two hundred francs ; her minor debts paid , all she had left was about eighty francs
1	one day , we really should do away with the old line that goes that history 's losers ’ lose because they ca not understand , ca not reason or talk – because they are too far away , too immured in their godforsaken bogs and their daily chores to understand the reasons for progress or for oppression
1	marius flinched ; he was being asked to disown his father
1	i ’ m well dressed and ugly
1	when two mouths , sanctified by love , come together to create , that ineffable kiss is simply bound to set the mysterious stars shuddering throughout immensity
1	you are just starting out in life , i ’ m about to leave it ; you go off to shows , to balls , to cafés , to billiards , you ’ re witty , you please the ladies , you ’ re a good-looking boy ; i , i sit there spitting on my embers in the middle of summer ; you are rich with the only riches that count , i ’ ve got all the impoverishments of old age , infirmity , isolation !
1	the shadows that enveloped him entered his mind
1	in his death throes , he witnesses the immense madness of the sea
1	there , in the jaunty gloom of the greenery , a host of innocent voices spoke softly to the soul , and what the warbling forgot to say , the humming completed
1	he had an air of serenity that made him strangely venerable
1	the only things worth the trouble of being said and of being listened to
1	he had been mixed up with the group of insurgents
1	he was a small man of fifty or so , lively , weathered , puny , yellow , cheeky , frantic , whose limbs and whose whole person exhibited a sort of sickly feebleness and whose eyes expressed immense strength
1	otherwise , jean valjean was happy
1	that said , he sat with sovereign authority at the table , where the candle and the writing set still stood , pulled out a stamped sheet of official letterhead from his pocket , and started on his report
1	in the meadows , branches of trees broken by gunfire but not broken off , were hanging on by their bark and swaying gently in the night breeze
1	monsieur , replied the elder boy , we haven ’ t eaten since early this morning
1	now here ’ s a lamp , the bishop went on , that does not give much light
1	he ’ s going to appear in the circuit court for some highway robbery he did before
1	athens and rome have and keep , even through all the nocturnal depths of the centuries , the glories of civilization
1	does that gentleman always go about with books under his arm like that ?
1	marius felt a barrier , cosette ’ s purity , and cosette felt a support , marius ’ s loyalty
1	when he finished speaking , his eyes closed
1	candles were just being lit as he asked the first person he came across for the home of monsieur pontmercy
1	the father , with the agility of an acrobat , grabbed a jug with a broken neck that was sitting on the hearth and threw water on the embers
1	only once did marius make an attempt of the kind
1	doubtless , historically , the riots had their beauty ; the war of the cobblestones is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of the bushes ; in one lies the soul of the forest , in the other the heart of the city ; one has jean chouan , the other has jeannenumber the riots lit up in red , garishly but splendidly , all the most prominent features of the parisian character in its originality , generosity , devotion , stormy gaiety , with students proving that bravery plays a part in intelligence , the national guard unshakable , the bivouacs of shopkeepers , the fortresses of street kids , the contempt for death of the average man in the street
1	do whatever you like with it , he told her
1	but the poor man , generous and noble , who does not work , is lost
1	when you come across one , the shock is brutal and forces you to take a stand , for or against
1	now and then he took another step toward the door
1	it seemed obvious that certain spanish officers tasked with resisting yielded too easily , the whiff of corruption was given off by the victory ; it felt as if it was more a case of the generals having been won than the battles , and the victorious soldier went home humiliated
1	a sombre calm had succeeded the wild tumult that had filled the garret a few minutes before
1	no one ever knew
1	the blow-in said to the resident : you can see what ’ s on my back , i ’ ve got to get out , you have the key , give it to me
1	it seemed to him that everything around him looked different suddenly and he cried out : of course !
1	the chicken 's wings have undergone major transformations and now look like legs , with the wing twisted into a position suitable for walking and the fingers pivoting to facilitate pressure on the ground
1	this woman ’ s child was one of the most divine creatures you could ever hope to see , a little girl two or three years old
1	an investigation had been conducted , witnesses had just been heard , they had been unanimous ; sure knowledge had shone forth out of the whole sorry deliberations
1	in vain , for he did not die
1	he was a convict
1	you ’ ve knocked this gentleman around a bit and now you ’ d like to tuck him away somewhere safe
1	it is on one of the lawns of the garden that this tale was improvised by a rosy mouth of six and told to blue eyes of four or five : once upon a time there were three little chickens who lived in the countryside where there were lots of flowers
1	citizens , cried enjolras , and there was in his voice an almost angry tremor , the republic is not rich enough in men to incur unnecessary costs
1	i may not have much time , perhaps
1	marius grabbed both her arms
1	as though they sensed they were about to die , the guards cried out : long live the emperor !
1	there is a way of running away that looks a lot like chasing after
1	i can ’ t put more than a sou a month into my lighting
1	but i ’ m telling you now i ’ m never putting these shoes on again and i won ’ t have anything more to do with them , for health reasons , to start with , and then for decency ’ s sake
1	they remember the garden in the rue plumet
1	his old face , pale and sad , seemed to be looking at the sky
1	you wanted to deliver the people from the monarchy , but you hand your girls over to the police instead
1	we have all had such troubled moments in which everything inside us breaks up ; we say whatever comes into our heads , which is not always exactly what we should say
1	the child ( six ) , sobbing : i told alix i knew my history of france
1	the souls of the just in sleep contemplate a mysterious heaven
1	madame magloire has cleaned them all up and this summer she ’ s going to fix up a bit of damage here and there , revarnish the lot and the room will be a real little museum
1	the fact is he put them off
1	but what were they to do ?
1	we ’ ve talked about the disaster of the ohain path
1	and the man , overcome , bowing and scraping , grabbed the note and examined it
1	mademoiselle vaubois , a perfect example of her kind , was the very picture of stupidity without a single blot of intelligence
1	it seems they had thought of that , for it had been lined with a sheet of tin inserted into the wall a bit to the back and punched with a thousand holes tinier than the holes of a colander
1	she had completely forgotten about the bread
1	never mind , it doesn ’ t matter
1	cosette had no idea what was happening in paris
1	that is what i thought
1	the same fury is legitimate against terray and absurd against turgotnumber the smashing of machines , the pillaging of warehouses , the tearing up of railway lines , the demolition of docks , the wrong turns taken by the multitudes , the people ’ s denials of justice for progress , ramus assassinated by schoolboys , number rousseau driven out of switzerland , number pelted with stones—that is rioting
1	in the distance the fugitives , stopping now and then , out of breath , listened in the darkness as the mournful thunder grew fainter
1	i ’ ll get monsieur gillenormand to scold you
1	especially , said grantaire , in the mouth of a man stuffed up with a cold
1	the wall was whitewashed again in number the nations were trading insults on it
1	it believes in heredity and in hierarchy
1	he hoped to find enlightenment there , instead he found a complete muddle
1	this daughter of darkness had class
1	the mistake , or misfortune , of the doctrinaire party lay in creating old young people
1	mother hucheloup , weren ’ t you complaining just the other day that you ’ d been fined for breaking the law because gibelotte had shaken a bedspread out your window ?
1	roses are red , violets are blue ,
1	there was nothing in javert ’ s soul that wasn ’ t written all over his face
1	he wouldn ’ t have been too hard put to make a connection between the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herodnumber monsieur , innocence is its own crown
1	fantine had been at the factory for over a year when , one morning , the overseer of the workshop handed her fifty francs on behalf of monsieur le maire , told her that she was no longer part of the factory , and requested her , on behalf of monsieur le maire , to kindly leave the district
1	something that happened the other day
1	one house among these ruins , the farmhouse , is still inhabited
1	he told himself that it was true , then , that there were exceptions , that authority could be unseated , that the rules could be brought up short by a deed , that not everything was framed within the text of the code , that the unforeseen commanded obedience , that the virtue of a convict could present a snare for the virtue of a public servant , that the monstrous could be divine , that destiny set up these kinds of ambushes , and he thought with despair that even he had not been safe from a surprise
1	i don ’ t think you can really call such a small thing a good deed ; but if it is a good deed , well then , let ’ s say that i did it
1	what if i put coats on my melons for them ?
1	this child of the quagmire is also a child of the ideal
1	marius went to courfeyrac ’ s place
1	i ’ ve got permission to bring you in ; but before i can bring you in , i ’ ve got to get you out
1	her eyes were a deep celestial blue , but this veiled azure still held only the gaze of a child
1	the liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins
1	gavroche had forgotten about it
1	the call-and-answer did what it could in this dialogue , always coming back to the subject of love , like those weighted dolls made of elder wood that bounce back upright each time they ’ re knocked down
1	fouché answered : number wherever you like , you moron !
1	these ideas , which were infantile , as we said , and at the same time sterile , gave him , in their very childishness , a fairly just notion of the influence of showy trappings on a young girl ’ s imagination
1	let ’ s wait for them to come into the street before we retaliate
1	let ’ s take a closer look
1	the old soldier replied in the calm and sovereign tone of one who was there : in the heel
1	this is so good !
1	at the same time , an extraordinary change took shape in his ideas
1	i ’ ll take you to see frédérick lemaître
1	woman is man ’ s right
1	roguet had set a grim example in threatening to kill any french grenadier who brought him a prussian prisoner
1	it handled royal persons only in sorrow and with care
1	between you and me , i think that nincompoop of a lancer had a try at wooing her
1	at sunrise—the peculiarity of the sun rising is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the night , and the laugh we have is always in proportion to the fear we have had—at sunrise cosette woke to dismiss her fright as a nightmare and said to herself : what was i dreaming about ?
1	one day the sisters overheard her talking in her feverish delirium : i have been a sinner , but when i have my child back with me , that will mean god has forgiven me
1	her blush did not last long
1	we have always thought that this was sometimes an act of courage , and at the very least a simple and useful activity , worthy of the sympathetic attention that duty accepted and performed deserves
1	everything ’ s arranged—and nothing is , said fauchelevent
1	later on , this fades away like the sweetness of a kitten and all that grace ends , on two legs in the bourgeois , and on four legs in the tomcat
1	the mind ’ s eye dimly makes them out
1	he can ’ t hear me
1	de meaux , replied laigle
1	the shifty black look in their eyes gives them away
1	this population , full of proud virtue , capable of the highest degree of latent heat , always ready to take up arms , quick to explode , irritable , deep , ground down , seemed to be waiting only for a flying spark to fall
1	a rose-coloured cloud blankets all that
1	sixteen years count in the underground education in rioting , and june number knew a lot more about it than june number and so the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie was just a rough draft , an embryo , compared to the two colossal barricades that we have briefly described ; but , for the time , it was pretty impressive
1	having got away from the rue plumet without any complications or incidents was already a step in the right direction
1	he was sinking deeper and deeper
1	he eyed a bit of wall plastered with the most pacific sheet of paper in the world , an authorization to eat eggs , the pastoral letter for lent from the archbishop of paris to his flock
1	at the beginning of this century , the paris sewer was still a mysterious place
1	time to give the pot a good skim
1	does this infinite arouse in us the idea of an essence , whereas we can only attribute to ourselves the idea of existence ?
1	he put the wallet back in marius ’ s pocket
1	i , too , have my patients ; to start with , i have theirs , whom they call the unwell ; and then , i have my own , whom i call the unfortunate
1	jean valjean had gone to look for her
1	it would be hard to conceive of a general without troops or a king without subjects
1	in a few bounds , jean valjean was at his side
1	her voice was querulous and her mind leaped about like a flea
1	that ’ s why i contemplate you instead
1	the fight will be colossal ; and the shadow cast , in that great epic field where humanity thrashes about , by this footslogger and this jumped-up bonesetter as they battle it out , will equal the shadow cast by megaryon , king of lycia , land of tigers , wrestling gigantic ajax , equal of the gods
1	this information delivered , gavroche added : i authorize you to tan their hides
1	with cosette ’ s garter , homer would have made the iliad
1	he kept coming back all the time to the job of being a grurin , as though he were hoping that the man realized , without giving him hard advice directly , that this would be a refuge for him
1	on one corner of the table was an old odd volume with a reddish cover ; its format , which was the old duodecimo of reading rooms , revealed a novel
1	he deciphered the few lines written by marius and muttered : gillenormand , rue des filles-du-calvaire , number six
1	despite the current negationism , freedom of expres- sion has at least one limit : the call to murder and torture
1	these bernardinesnumber were , consequently , not linked to clairvaux , like the bernadine monks , but to cîteaux , like the benedictine monks
1	well , that ’ s how it ’ s going to be
1	the old woman straightened up , furious
1	this concerned the latch on the front door
1	two napoléons , growled an old toothless hag who was there
1	the good lord ’ s hands are black all the time from this dreadful dirty oil
1	marius , still kept apart from his fiancée , according to custom , came only in the second
1	we know very well who you are ; we know very well that you are all brave men , for christ ’ s sake !
1	to stop herself from being bored , she had opened her piano-organ and had started to sing , accompanying herself , the chorus from euryanthenumber—hunters lost in the woods ! —which is perhaps the most beautiful thing in all music
1	he grabbed an old hat and his purse
1	the answer , which had to do with the name of the street and not the street itself , appeared to marius more conclusive than it was
1	the apartment was provided with all the necessary utensils
1	night there was dramatic
1	what is certain is that the next day a postilion was lobbed from the charlemagne yard into the lions ’ den over the five-story building that separated the two yards
1	the one who looked like the leader turned round and strongly indicated with his right hand the direction jean valjean had taken ; one of the others seemed to be pointing somewhat stubbornly in the opposite direction
1	like roger the dodger , he was playing some frightening private game of hide-and-seek with death ; every time the pug-nosed face of the spectre came close , the gamin gave him the flick
1	this made for riddles that exercised the imaginations of the big girls
1	searched for , yes ; followed , no
1	oh , don ’ t you worry , mademoiselle
1	the man himself had the strangest expression on his face , a kind of deliriously happy pain , and he fixed his gaze calmly on javert , who was still watching him like a hawk
1	you would have been hard-pressed to come across anyone on the road more derelict in appearance
1	the first proof of charity in a priest , and especially in a bishop , is poverty
1	there , everything must be subordinate to the shortest path
1	incomplete , yes ; but sublime
1	he had come back to reality
1	no one worries about how we are treated
1	the wrinkles on his forehead were in the right place and would have biased in his favour anyone paying him particular attention
1	so then , sign uf
1	she stuttered in her barneville peasant ’ s talk : i ’ m ever the same ; i do whatever i do ; the remainder is not my work
1	the way they had repelled the night attack made them almost scorn the dawn attack before the event
1	meanwhile , he worked all day on his patch of indigo and at night he went home to water his garden and read his books
1	who were a mere handful against an entire army !
1	in those days , certain houses near the park in the rue madame and the rue d ’ enfer had keys to the luxembourg , which the residents used when the gates were closed , a special dispensation since done away with
1	he uses whatever tool he pleases
1	yes , you clearly see future times ; yes , you are right
1	at that precise moment éponine had tracked the burglars as far as the boulevard
1	a lovely big spiderweb , nice and black and adorned with dead flies , fanned out over one of the windowpanes
1	and then , are all riots calamities ?
1	most of them , chatting unguardedly , did justice to the king ’ s good points , standing as he did with one foot in the monarchy and the other in the revolution ; none of them hated him
1	what could be more just ?
1	i the seventh circlenumber and the eighth heaven
1	louis xviii , who was busily annotating horace with his thumbnail and worrying about heroes who get themselves made emperors and clogmakers who get themselves made dauphins , had two causes for concern : napoléon and mathurin bruneaunumber the académie française proposed an essay prizenumber on this theme : the happiness that comes from study
1	the two old men had gone and got cosette from the fruit-hawker in the rue du chemin-vert , where fauchelevent had dropped her off the night before
1	all this went with the statesman , ex-ambassador
1	he had begun by opening his bag , hoping to drop in the two young girls who were supposed to be on surveillance outside the rat ’ s nest of a building
1	he dined on bread and potatoes
1	the man didn ’ t answer
1	sometimes he even lifts something else
1	that one was a boy , too
1	and so , he walked on , in some perplexity , putting dozens of questions to himself about this enigmatic character
1	what do we do with this gold dung ?
1	i ’ m not hungry anymore , said the child
1	she vaguely felt some nameless horror looming
1	he said to his wife
1	he nodded to cosette and placed the hand of the lady in her little hand
1	no idiom could be more metaphoric than slang
1	he looks so hard at humanity , he sees its soul ; he looks so hard at creation , he sees god
1	a sort of ghastly fascination nailed him to the spot from which he looked down on the whole scene
1	but enjolras and marius and seven or eight others who had rallied around them lunged forward and covered them
1	at that , jean valjean , who looked glum and broken , lifted his eyes , startled
1	the reality was that they were not as safe as jean valjean had thought
1	i ’ ll follow you wherever there ’ s room for a chair ; that everyone had to stay on their guard ; that come nightfall , there would be people looting isolated houses in the deserted corners of paris ( here you could detect the imagination of the police at work—that anne radcliffenumber embedded in the government ) ; that a battery had been planted in the rue aubry-le-boucher ; that lobau and bugeaudnumber were conferring and that at midnight , or at daybreak at the latest , four columns would march at the same time on the centre of the riot , the first coming from the bastille , the second from the porte saint-martin , the third from la grève , the fourth from les halles ; that perhaps the troops would also evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ de mars ; that no one knew what would happen but that one thing was for sure and that was that , this time , it was serious
1	what he tends to go in for , and we say this with the proper dose of regret , is not in the classical taste
1	it would be a mistake to write to liège for corks or to pau for glovesnumber miss dahlia , if i were you , i ’ d call myself rose
1	she was the shadow
1	the two women watched the bishop without a word , without a movement , without a glance that might upset him
1	and to me the oblivious , the pitiless , the guilty , the ungrateful wretch , he says : thank you !
1	they talked about this and that , noisily , passionately
1	the vast night confronted this tiny being
1	his head was thrown back against the pillow in the abandoned attitude of sleep ; over the side of the bed his hand dangled , adorned with his pastoral ring—the hand that had performed so many good works and saintly deeds
1	he had never had the time to fall in love
1	jean valjean had gone wrong from the start
1	he uttered the word enormous for the second time with an exaggerated snicker that only capital letters could do justice to
1	he turned to the three convicts : well , i recognize you , i certainly do !
1	what is the ideal ?
1	in those days the gates of the cemeteries of paris were shut at sunset , and , since this was a regulation made by the municipality , vaugirard cemetery was subject to it like the rest
1	marius said nothing ; for a second she remained silent , too , then she cried : if i wanted to , but , i could make you pretty happy !
1	and in that battle i saved a general called count someone-or-other !
1	we might as well spell it out
1	pierce through the livid face of a human being at certain moments as they ponder , look behind the façade , look into the soul , look into the darkness
1	but , no matter what he did , and no matter what extenuating circumstances he looked for , he could not avoid falling back on this : the man was a convict ; that is , the one who does not even have a place on the social ladder , being below the lowest rung
1	a savage breath rose from that abyss
1	kidlingtons , if you don ’ t find mummy and daddy , come back this evening
1	unfortunately , as he was alone and it was night-time , all this was neither seen nor seeable
1	madame magloire ripped all the paper off
1	when he ’ d fumbled in one pocket , he fumbled in the other
1	you reek of gunpowder
1	the fury of the rising tide was stamped on that amorphous clutter
1	it was not an act of infidelity to cosette ; it was a thoughtful and sweet farewell to a poor unhappy soul
1	what ’ ll you give me ?
1	we will meet up with him again
1	he ’ s within his rights
1	there is no longer anything of the middle ages in our constitution
1	marius was walking slowly down this slope , his eyes fixed on someone he could no longer see
1	the one who ’ s about to fly off is a saint
1	this greasy spoon was run by people by the name of thénardier , husband and wife
1	it was the noise of footsteps , someone was walking in the shadows , someone was coming his way
1	you see i can express myself properly
1	he was full of horror , but it seemed to him that the good thought was winning
1	they sank out of sight below the horizon
1	they made a front half a mile long
1	the old woman saw him fumble around in his pocket and take out a sewing kit , scissors , and thread ; he proceeded to unpick the lining of one of the tails of his redingote and pulled out of the opening a piece of yellowing paper , which he then straightened out
1	could you be bound in any shape or form of gratitude to such a miserable bastard ?
1	since a patrol was going back to its post at the arsenal , he requisitioned it and brought it along
1	on top of this , he was regular in his habits , and went out only for the demonstrable necessities of the orchard and the vegetable garden
1	with the remaining cobblestones they blocked up the opening
1	she was called mademoiselle gillenormand the elder
1	basque , without waiting for jean valjean to approach , addressed him : monsieur le baron asked me to ask monsieur if he would like to go up or stay downstairs ?
1	since she had gone away , there was nothing left for him to do but die
1	all of a sudden she thought she heard someone walking in the garden
1	where did you come from ?
1	it was already broad daylight , but as the sun ’ s rays were perfectly horizontal she thought it was still early , but that she should get up anyway—to welcome marius
1	a clot of blood had built up in the knot of his cravat ; his shirt was sinking into in his wounds , the cloth of his coat was rubbing against the gaping gashes in his living flesh
1	even hypocrisy , the ultimate cynicism , does not put it off ; it is so literary that it won ’ t hold its nose when faced by basilius , and it is no more scandalized by tartuffe ’ s posturing than horace was shocked by priapus ’ hiccupsnumber no feature of the universal face is lacking in paris ’ s profile
1	at first monsieur madeleine had been vilified by slander and calumny , according to a sort of universal law that all those who better themselves are subject to ; then these were reduced to spiteful cracks , then they became mere malicious jokes , and then that entirely evaporated
1	there is spade , sword , which comes from spada ; carvel , boat , which comes from caravella
1	she was counting on marius ’ s despair when he did not find cosette , and she was not mistaken
1	no choice was possible between these men who appeared to onlookers to be the elite of the gutter , the scum of the earth
1	in short , and we have insisted on this more than once , this whole inner fusion , this whole set , the result of which was lofty virtue , had wound up making jean valjean a father for cosette
1	the bernardine-benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows into their order
1	it doesn ’ t enlighten me as to your intrinsic and essential worth , you who have come here most likely presuming to bring me enlightenment
1	she seized marius ’ s hand convulsively with her wounded hand , but she no longer seemed to feel pain
1	it was not daybreak , it was dawn ; a ravishing , wild moment
1	who was this little one that thénardier had called the lark ?
1	his voice had become strangely calm again
1	all ready to go
1	old women had bundled up the tragic friend of the people for the grave in these swaddling clothes that had known the pleasures of the flesh
1	what he had just said had brought him closer to the one who stands at death ’ s door
1	marius , who was stepping into the downstairs room , scarcely noticed
1	in the middle of the grass you notice an uprooted tree trunk , recumbent , covered in green shoots
1	we blame the church when it is riddled with intrigue , we scorn the spiritual when it is hard on the temporal ; but we honour the meditative man wherever he appears
1	certain convicts , who are always hatching escape plans , end up turning combined strength and skill into a veritable science—the science of muscles
1	deeds are one , ideas the other
1	what do you mean ?
1	there is a great tumult ; everything in us speaks , except our mouths
1	the first row , on their knees , received the cuirassiers on the ends of their bayonets , the second row gunned them down ; behind the second row the cannoneers loaded their pieces , the front of the square opened up , made way for an eruption of firepower and then closed again
1	in any case , mother jondrette was still rattling around in her iron scrap
1	beginning of a great sickness
1	scarcely had he quit the room than the traveller came in
1	this particular man was old , the sight of his white hair on top of his black face was shocking
1	not if it ’ s you two
1	what is a cat ?
1	all along the bare table at intervals there were enamel basins in which the pupils themselves washed their metal cups and their plates , sometimes chucking out scraps , a tough bit of meat or rotten fish—an act that was punished
1	two barricades at right angles stretched out and ran from the rue montorgueil to the grande-truanderie , and from the rue geoffroy-langevin to the rue sainte-avoye
1	we don ’ t know what to do
1	there was a moment of silence in the rathole
1	no , of course not
1	put ’ em in a hat ! —
1	i want to eat
1	what was this sombre game of providence that had placed this child in such close contact with this man ?
1	you reached it by the spiral staircase that came out in a corner of the room in a square hole like a ship ’ s hatch
1	for the past two years , he had got the gravedigger , good old father mestienne , drunk a dozen times
1	no one ’ s throwing anything away these days
1	but whatever he was , now when he was tied up with ropes , surrounded by homicidal maniacs and half-buried , so to speak , in a grave that was getting deeper under him at every instant , faced with both the fury and the calm of thénardier , the man remained imperturbable ; and marius could not help but admire , at such a moment , that superbly melancholy face
1	a monster spewed out , etc
1	alain resnais had already contrasted photographs of survivors and corpses taken when the camps were opened up with the mutism and indifference of the surrounding natural environment ( night and fog )
1	yet old man thénardier , having learned by some obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the mother was forced to disown her , demanded fifteen francs a month , saying that the creature was growing and ate like a wild thing and threatening to send her back
1	one of his comrades replied , the soldiers have got some !
1	and his existence—he didn ’ t just risk it once , but twenty times !
1	he sat beside them , made cosette sit , and took their four hands in his old hands , gnarled as they were
1	the woman was basically a brute and the man had all the makings of a complete scoundrel
1	her nostrils were pinched and as pale as if she had heaved her last sigh
1	a prisoner of jean valjean
1	meanwhile , at the same time as the swans , the two little strays headed for the brioche
1	he had the strangest physiognomy , which started off looking humble and ended up looking harsh
1	it was a short iron bar , sharpened at one end like a hunting spear
1	if a man with a family finds himself at harvest time with his sons in the army and his daughters working as domestics in town , and he ’ s sick and can ’ t work , the curé offers up prayers for him and on sunday , after mass , all the people in the village , men , women , and children , go into the poor man ’ s field and harvest his crop for him and they take the straw and grain and put it in his granary
1	the figures were the numbers five , six , and eight and a half
1	all winter cosette ’ s little house was heated from top to bottom
1	and he dropped his pole-axe in a corner and followed mother thénardier out
1	it was obviously a whole way of thinking that poured its heart out there , sigh by sigh , erratically , without order , without choice , without aim , randomly
1	if it were given to our eye of flesh and blood to see the fearsome and lovely sights of the higher life , we would probably see the forms of the night , winged strangers , the blue bystanders of the invisible , bend down , a throng of dark heads , over the luminous house , satisfied , blessing , pointing out to each other , sweetly alarmed , the virgin bride , and wearing the reflection of human bliss on their divine faces
1	javert committed all these mistakes , yet was no less one of the smartest and ablest spies who ever existed
1	that is something you may be forgiven for doubting
1	you ’ d think there was nothing to it—one week later , finding a wedding party that went by in paris at mardi gras !
1	he came and examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon looking at a broken leg
1	he paused and then added : i ’ ll be dead in three hours
1	you ’ re the mayor , you can do it !
1	to sum up once more , the gamin de paris today , like the graeculus of romenumber in days gone by , is the man of the people as a child , with the wrinkles of the old world on his forehead
1	that particular knot still held
1	at eleven o ’ clock sharp i ’ ll be in the chapel
1	let 's turn now to contemporary theatre and dance , in particular the work of choreographer , meg stuart
1	today it is not rare for a little cowherd to be called arthur , alfred , or alphonse , or for a vicomte—if vicomtes still exist—to be called thomas , pierre , or jacques
1	action of the guilty
1	a little while after this , monsieur madeleine was appointed mayor
1	this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling while listening to the man with the white hair talking to her , and nothing was as ravishing as that fresh smile that went with her downcast eyes
1	he had never been known to have a sweetheart in the region
1	what had happened can be told in a few words
1	there they are , on the box , on the folding seat , on the sides of the hood , on the trailing arm
1	off you go , my darling cosette , leave us a moment
1	courfeyrac did not ask him any questions
1	you get soaked to the bone
1	marmosets worth four sous apiece , making innuendos and pathetic wisecracks !
1	wisdom is holy communion
1	hello , law and order
1	mother thénardier had no comeback
1	a few unintelligible pages on the sins of young boys was what was most interesting for them
1	his musings grew clearer and clearer
1	to borrow one of those vulgar phrases that have the merit of expressing in a single word ideas that can scarcely be expressed in a page , madame magloire had the look of a peasant and mademoiselle baptistine of a lady
1	besides , his mother loved his sisters
1	all with the skill of a conjurer
1	it was a mud hole in a cavern of pitch-black night
1	he believed as much as he could
1	one of the guests observed that it was mardi gras and that the place would be packed with carriages there
1	when it comes to those we love , we come up with all kinds of mad things in our concern
1	he felt that he was reaching the other decisive moment of his conscience and his fate ; that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that this champmathieu was marking the second
1	it sucks the fluids out of the blood through the veins ; coagulation follows , then the blood solidifies ; then you get tuberculosis in the lungs , then death
1	after having 'only reluctantly ' abandoned the figure on the pretext of not mutilating it , the american painter then chose to end this life himself as well by exercising the most nihilistic of freedoms of expression : that of self-destruction
1	this era will pass , is already passing ; we are beginning to understand that , if there may be some force in a boiler , there can only be power in a brain ; in other words , that what leads and pulls the world along is not locomotives , it is ideas
1	when he had finished speaking , the prioress interrupted the slipping of her rosary beads through her fingers and said to him : can you , between now and this evening , get hold of a strong iron bar ?
1	it was warm inside and he found quite a decent bed of straw
1	his principal adornment was a pair of elephant-legs—ballooning nankeen trousers , with stirrups of copper braid ; he had a strong rattan cane in his hand that had cost two hundred francs , and , as his boldness knew no bounds , he had the strangest thing , a cigar , in his mouth
1	after thirteen months had elapsed , the pawnshop had sold the copperplates of his flora
1	well , was i right or wasn ’ t i ?
1	good grief , it ’ s you , father madeleine !
1	and the law doesn ’ t even put up a notice
1	this packet was taken to the guardhouse
1	it was a strange lightning flash
1	the theft of a people has no statutory limit
1	he now made a third
1	the elite felt troubled just as the teeming hordes did—in a different way , but every bit as much
1	he questioned himself ; he patted himself down ; he was dizzy from all those vanished realities
1	it could easily hold twenty beds !
1	she lives in a garden where there ’ s a gate , rue plumet
1	he was so shy he was rude
1	his whole heart melted in gratitude and he felt more and more love
1	he remembered the inspector of the rue de pontoise and the two pistols he had given him , which he , marius , had used in this very barricade ; and he not only remembered the face , but he remembered the name
1	javert , who had not looked up , forged on :
1	what time is it ?
1	dutch colonizers in indonesia took those images to celebrate their work civilizing the natives
1	in fact , it ’ s very simple : a man has a bit of fun shoving snow down a woman ’ s back , that gives them a laugh—the officers , they ’ ve got to have some fun somehow ; the likes of me , we ’ re just there to keep them happy , of course we are !
1	they drank there , they ate there , they spouted there ; they paid little , they paid badly , they did not pay at all , yet they were always welcome
1	for four months , i was dead
1	this , then , was the essence and quintessence of white—legitimist—paris societynumber people of renown were shunned there , even when they were royalists
1	the jig was up
1	you can recognize them by the quills they wear in their hatband
1	on the sole condition of reaching down all the way to the people
1	five , six , eight and a half ?
1	thénardier answered in a straightforward manner : he ’ s a rich farmer
1	meanwhile , while some were singing , others were talking away at the top of their lungs and all at the same time ; the place was nothing but noise
1	his white hair added sweet majesty to the shiny bright light that lay over his face
1	but did anyone in the past ever fret about the very particular silence of the visible , best exemplified by the pictorial or sculptural image ?
1	three or four times a year , jean valjean donned his uniform and did his stint of guard duty , and very gladly , too ; for him , it was the perfect disguise , which let him mingle with the world at large while leaving him alone
1	his hideout was the arche-marion sewer
1	with cosette , behind her , a white-haired man had come , looking grave yet smiling , but with a small , heartbreaking smile
1	this tactic was known to the ancients
1	people whispered in horror of monstrous possibilities involving the king ’ s blood-red baths
1	nothing , said marius with an almost fierce firmness and resolve
1	you were in a cloud of glory and you had all kinds of heavenly figures all around you
1	the sister answered : no
1	there was intense anxiety in the redoubt
1	as soon as enjolras folded his arms , accepting the end , the deafening clamour of the struggle died down in the room , and the chaos suddenly abated in a sort of sepulchral solemnity
1	and , satisfied with the positive response he had given himself , he rushed on : we talked about you a lot , the two of us
1	that was the sixteenth of june and , then , the second of july
1	he didn ’ t exactly stand up again ; he stayed in a half-crouching position like that of a scared wildcat , turning his back on the heap of dead , scrutinizing the skyline , on his knees , the whole top part of his body being supported by his two index fingers on the ground , his head peering over the rim of the sunken road
1	in sum , no window is opened for thought by a philosophy that makes everything end in the monosyllable no
1	i don ’ t know what ’ s the matter with me , i see light
1	he had just stepped outside his door , where ma bougon was at that moment sweeping the doorstep while delivering this memorable monologue : what ’ s cheap these days ?
1	when he had finished , the audience burst out laughing
1	about three quarters of an hour before midnight
1	and then i ’ ll take you to a show
1	you could see two straight stiff shapes under the black cloth , one big , the other little , and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold folds of the shroud
1	shouted thénardier , insofar as you can shout keeping your voice down
1	they ’ ve killed him , cried combeferre
1	it meant cutting his losses , which is an option a person must never turn down
1	fantine owed them a hundred francs
1	i made use of the fire to cook ’ em
1	then thénardier went back and sat very close to monsieur leblanc
1	if you did not know what it was , the voice shut up and the wall became silent again as though the bewildered darkness of the tomb had been on the other side
1	he had given cosette a dress of binche guipure lace which had come down to him from his very own grandmother
1	i the night after a day ’ s walk
1	some would come running and others would line the roadside ; for a passing king always creates a commotion
1	if the old boy ’ s a philanthropist , what ’ s it to you ?
1	the bishop went on sleeping in profound peace beneath this frightening stare
1	madame might remember that it was his habit to go on trips from time to time
1	it ’ s out of honesty
1	a wide chimney , probably left over from some ancient kitchen of the ducs de la force , started at ground level and passed through the next four floors , dividing all the dormitories in half , like a sort of flattened pillar , before boring through the roof
1	no trace of the chaos of the night before last remained
1	finally he left the luxembourg , hoping to come across her again in a street somewhere
1	well , he had just faltered
1	we think we are sanitizing the city , but we are depleting the population
1	it tells us both less and more : this was , it is part of a certain history , it is history
1	napoléon was one of those geniuses that release thunder
1	but in the middle of the silence , fantine yelled : i can hear her !
1	do any of you have wives , yes or no ?
1	there was just enough light coming in through this window for a man ’ s face to appear like the face of a phantom
1	i like you better in love than a jacobin
1	answer me , for christ ’ s sake !
1	there was nothing to say
1	even the police reports of which it is sometimes the object now show respect for it
1	they were savages , yes ; but savages of civilization
1	and yet , on certain points and in certain places , despite philosophy and despite progress , the claustral spirit lives on , right into the middle of the nineteenth century , and a bizarre recrudescence in asceticism is stunning the civilized world at this very moment
1	widow hucheloup was short-winded and misshapen , full of country memories
1	the flora of the environs of cauteretz stopped selling altogether
1	old heart and young heart face-to-face
1	two versions of an 'art ' that french artist , christian boltanski , has tried to pull off according to his own lights in order to fend off forgetting ,
1	you ’ ve got a head on your shoulders—use it
1	the july revolution had been a beautiful popular breath of fresh air , swiftly followed by blue skies
1	the dawn that follows a battle always rises over bare corpses
1	the cashier lived in the room exactly below monsieur madeleine ’ s room
1	in any case , a coffin in which there is a living being , this expedient of the convict , is also the expedient of the emperor
1	the winters here are bitterly cold and of course we have to try and do something for those in need
1	he had blown out the candle by snorting through one nostril the way convicts do and dropped onto the bed fully clothed , and in an instant he was fast asleep
1	then he stood up again and leaned back against the fireplace : now , he said , we ’ re ready to receive the philanthropist
1	no , it ’ s over , forever
1	this man was dressed in a smock ; he was barefoot ; he was holding his shoes in his left hand ; he had obviously taken them off to approach jean valjean without being heard
1	this penetration by the darkness is unspeakably sinister for a child
1	the conventionist held out his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
1	will she keep quiet ?
1	he did not dither , but took the right
1	and those two poor wolf cubs
1	she has so much courage , that woman !
1	he sometimes spent half a day at a time gazing at a market garden , square beds of lettuce , hens scratching in the dung , and a horse turning the chain of a waterwheel
1	these were the columns that , two years previously , had supported the emperor ’ s podium in the champ de mainumber they were scorched and charred here and there by the bivouac fires of the austrians camped in barracks close to gros-caillounumber two or three of the columns had disappeared altogether in these fires , which warmed the great hands of the kaiserlichen , or imperialists
1	they could be heard saying : go easy on royalism !
1	barons are old geezers , they go to the luxembourg and sit in front of the château where there ’ s more sun , they read the quotidienne for a sou
1	i haven ’ t got one
1	it ’ s in this church that she hears mass , is it not ?
1	i was on the brink of becoming a lawyer
1	swear to me one thing !
1	but it was only a trick of the thénardiers to get more money
1	he took his time
1	be that as it may , as we have just pointed out , brains caught up in either wisdom or madness , or , as often happens , in both at the same time , only very slowly open up to the business of living
1	he kept his mouth shut , precisely because his heart would have leaped out of it
1	revolt , as we have said , sometimes occurs within the powers that be
1	the only thing on the horizon was the chain of the alps
1	leonidas versus the foreigner , timoleon versus the tyrantnumber—who is the greater ?
1	because alexander does for asia with the sword what christopher columbus does for america with the compass ; alexander , like columbus , discovers a world
1	in the end , amodern art ' was able to glean what communications and telecommunications tools now accomplish on a daily basis : the mise en abyme of the body , of the figure , with the major attendant risk of system , atic hyperviolence and a boom in porno- graphic high-frequency that has nothing to do with sexuality : jij/e must put out the excess rather than the fire , as heraclitus warned
1	monsieur madeleine , flabbergasted , started to open his mouth
1	how could he come so close to danger , only to run away !
1	a few minutes ticked away
1	don ’ t imagine that you ’ ll still be here tomorrow
1	they had to resign themselves to going hungry
1	one of the most loved , one of the most valiant
1	the bishop fell silent for a moment , then suddenly turned to the hospital director
1	all his good points had their bad points
1	the little girl ’ s whole person , the way she moved , her demeanor , the sound of her voice , the gaps between one word and the next , her eyes , her silence , her slightest gesture , expressed and translated a single idea : fear
1	it should be noted that the fire battering the barricade hardly disturbed the men inside it
1	manuel was proud and wise ,
1	when he was sitting down , she would press her cheek against his white hair and silently shed a tear , telling herself : he could well be my mother , this man here !
1	without really knowing what was wrong with her , she had the distinct feeling that there was something and that it had to be kept hidden
1	the bishop , for his part , though normally careful not to show curiosity , curiosity being as far as he was concerned very nearly a crime , could not prevent himself from scrutinizing the conventionist with an attention that , not having its source in sympathy , would have gone completely against his conscience if the man in question had been any other man
1	at the same time , the usher handed him the note
1	the sewer , in fact , reaps all the aftereffects of the growth of paris
1	and , bending over to marius ’ s ear , he whispered : too late
1	he was suffering the strange pangs of a conscience suddenly operated on for cataracts
1	the gendarme , who ’ s a good lad , he nudges my elbow and whispers to me : go on , answer
1	if he ’ d recognized me on his side , he wouldn ’ t be back
1	this was not picked up by the shady character in rags walking ahead
1	often when we think we are tying a knot with a simple thread , we don ’ t notice we ’ ve caught up another thread as well
1	the foreman replied : that ’ s good enough for the likes of you
1	he was moving forward—aimlessly
1	three francs fifty sous
1	her compliance here consisted in not remembering whatever marius forgot
1	there was nobody on the stairs , either
1	the girl had vanished
1	you follow my reasoning , don ’ t you ?
1	the entire cavalry poured out onto the plateau and it was like the start of an earthquake
1	cosette ’ ll be here tomorrow
1	once you ’ re through the gate , you scurry home , grab your pass , come back , the cemetery gatekeeper ’ ll open up for you and then you won ’ t have to pay , because you ’ ll have your pass
1	they range from images of the renewed pomp of religion , similar to that staged by the man who made ivan the terrible , perhaps to embrace , in a single sweeping glance , the russia of the tsars and the priests and the russia of the soviet dictator , and to the enigmatic image of an old man with an inscrutible face taking part in a ceremony
1	in which case , woe betide the sewer workers
1	think of me sometimes
1	several incidents occurred , the coffin was trotted around the vendôme column , number stones were thrown at the duc de fitz-james , number spotted on a balcony with his hat on , the gallic cocknumber was ripped off a popular standard and dragged through the mud , a police officer was wounded by a sword thrust at the porte saint-martin , an officer of the numberth light was heard to say out loud , i am a republican , the école polytechnique popped up unexpectedly after its forced confinement , with shouts of long live the école polytechnique !
1	the walls of this room , apart from two nails for hanging up the knee pad and the basket , were adorned only with an example of the royalist paper money of ’ number stuck on the wall over the mantelpiece
1	he reached the pont d ’ austerlitz
1	today cosette is passing out of my life ; we are going our separate ways
1	if he tried to chop wood , he cut his finger
1	can you be too alive ?
1	and he took him to the room of the friends of the abc
1	baring had been dislodged , alten put to the sword
1	she walked bent forward with her head down like an old woman
1	monsieur fabantou , yes , that ’ s right , i remember
1	she had in her countenance , more than before , that indefinably frightened and pathetic look that a stint in jail adds to misery
1	love one another : number he declared this to be complete , desired nothing more ; it was the sum total of his doctrine
1	what on earth is that ?
1	those of the lay sisters that the boarders liked the most were sister saint euphrasia , sister saint marguerite , sister saint martha , who was in her second childhood , and sister saint michel , whose long nose made them hoot with laughter
1	courfeyrac was energetically demolishing it
1	was he simply obeying some sort of instinctive impulse obscure even to himself ?
1	all that it took was a few words uttered by her husband , the name no doubt that her husband had whispered in her ear , for this big sleepy woman to wake up and shift from repulsive to appalling
1	you get so attached
1	and he put the hundred-sou piece in the boy ’ s hand
1	a train of mysterious forces takes possession of you
1	passersby of forty years ago would stop in the street to gaze at it , without suspecting the secrets it concealed behind its fresh green layers
1	but you ’ re a bon vivant , too
1	fantine had aged ten years overnight
1	if a crime was shorthanded , they subcontracted accomplices
1	when jean valjean had accosted him , old fauchelevent had , indeed , had in his hand a corner of a straw mat that he was busy laying over the melon bed
1	a question presented itself
1	after a month , they fish up your man for you in the saint-cloud nets
1	by jove , this armchair is empty
1	the man heard a noise in the sewer
1	at the moment that the uproar of the demons was moving away , you would have said a choir of angels was coming closer in the dark
1	he ’ s got his sorrows , that one has
1	the tavern was the only place open , and that for the good reason that that is where the crowd had rushed to
1	matter exists , the moment exists , interests exist , the stomach exists ; but the stomach must not be the sole guiding light
1	then he sat on the steps , his heart full of sweetness and resolve , he blessed his love from the bottom of his heart and he told himself that , since cosette had gone , all that was left for him to do now was to die
1	today the defenders of the past , not being able to deny these things , have adopted the position of laughing at them
1	cosette was a ray of light
1	and you see the awful hand of the police shoot out of the shadows and promptly rip off my mask !
1	he could see what he hated seeing
1	the next day at sunrise , monseigneur bienvenu was circling his garden
1	the barricade is about to be seriously rocked
1	it ’ s that i have to be relieved of my duties
1	it was in place
1	this was his only pleasure now
1	if you stopped loving me , i ’ d race after you , i ’ d claw you to bits , i ’ d scratch your eyes out , i ’ d throw water over you , i ’ d have you arrested
1	i haven ’ t got anyone spare
1	when she wore holes in the heels of her stockings , she would simply stuff the stockings down into her shoes
1	it was , as you will recall , his custom to always have money on him
1	marius was beginning to worship his father
1	they have been marching since first light , they have come to the end of a long , hard day ; they did the first stretch with mirabeau , the second with robespierre , the third with bonaparte ; they are absolutely worn to a frazzle
1	aren ’ t you talking to me anymore , old fella ?
1	not a single faubourg , not a single regiment
1	this produces turmoil ; but after such turmoil , we recognize that a certain amount of ground has been covered
1	the bernardine-benedictines of martin verga practise perpetual adoration , as do the benedictines known as ladies of the blessed sacrament , number who , at the turn of the century , had two houses in paris , one at the temple and the other in the rue neuve-sainte-geneviève
1	the innkeeper was a man named jacquin labarre and he was held in high esteem in the town because he was related to another labarre , who kept another inn , the trois dauphins in grenoble and who had served in the guides
1	behind this story , it was said , there were makeshift arrangements that had been made for a magnificent marriage
1	that is my life for you
1	you had a good laugh at me back then , eh !
1	jean valjean said to himself
1	x the man wakes up
1	he had no idea what they were going on about ; no doubt he had complained in the heat of the moment about someone stealing that dear little girl from him so soon—out of tenderness he ’ d have liked to hang on to her for another two or three days—but it was her grandfather who had come for her , the most natural thing in the world
1	he took off his hat and greeted him with a sort of exasperated awkwardness : pardon me , monsieur le maire—
1	he hands me a sermon and his purse as presents
1	in better days , you ’ d only have had to look in my cupboards and you ’ d have seen for yourself that i wasn ’ t some slut living in a pigsty
1	cosette resumed her work , but for more than fifteen minutes she felt her heart skipping in her chest like a great snowflake
1	as if you were capable of it !
1	so he told himself : but it doesn ’ t mean anything , there ’ s nothing written there
1	supporting evidence , you understand ; a way of getting back on the trail of things and pinning the crime on the criminal
1	satan has two names—he is called satan and he is called lying
1	we both say that this house is not a bit safe ; that , if monseigneur will let me , i ’ ll go and tell paulin musebois , the locksmith , to come and put the old locks back on the door ; they ’ re just over there , it ’ ll only take a minute
1	pleasure—what a sad goal , what a puny ambition !
1	what would they think of a bishop who was frightened off ?
1	so what ’ s his name ?
1	the painting somehow restored his father to life and it suddenly stopped being the sign from the montfermeil tavern to become a resurrection ; in it a grave cracked open , a phantom rose to its feet , marius could hear his blood thumping at his temples , he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears , his bleeding father dimly painted on that sinister panel terrified him , he felt as though that amorphous blob was staring straight at him
1	this order of perpetual adoration is not all that old , going back no further than two hundred years
1	i ’ ll tell you what hurt me
1	every bishop worth his salt has his squadron of cherubic seminarians on patrol maintaining order in the episcopal palace and mounting guard over monseigneur ’ s smile
1	whatever the strange interior tranquillity just mentioned , the barricade , for those who remain inside it , remains no less unreal , a hallucination
1	) , as they said in the lower alps , and puerte un bouen moutou embe un bouen froumage grase ( a good sheep gives a good fat cheese ) , as they said in the upper dauphiné
1	all the streets were deserted , all the doors were open
1	he was a great man ; so much the worse , or so much the better ; the lesson is more to the point
1	well , then , mother hucheloup !
1	i hit ’ em with a bit of sound and fury about honour , and morality , and virtue !
1	royal houses are like those indian fig trees whose every branch hangs down all the way to the ground and takes root there to become itself a fig tree
1	because , if madame sees someone else carried it for me , she ’ ll belt me
1	the general movement that seemed to have been vaguely taking off had aborted ; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of the generals could now focus on the three or four barricades still standing
1	yet at nightfall , at the moment when the light went and in winter especially , at the hour when the icy evening breeze ripped the last red leaves off the elms , when the gloom was deep and starless , or when the moon and the wind punched holes in the clouds , the boulevard suddenly became terrifying
1	the louis , which she had on her in the same apron pocket the fifteen-sou coin had fallen out of the night before , kept distracting her
1	it ’ s a simple story
1	it seems that in extreme situations we often move around to ask the advice of all we might encounter in our travels
1	through the broken window , you could see snow falling
1	the wax used to be made with resin and lamp black and cost four francs a pound
1	cosette was sleeping soundly
1	she reappeared in this darkness , in this garret , in this diseased dump of a place , in this horror !
1	basically , there is only one harsh and cruel breaking story : you are not where what decides your fate happens
1	the result of this secret conference was a wonderful pleasure trip that took place the following sunday , the four young men inviting the four young women along
1	the moon , which had just risen behind her , cast her shadow in front of her on the lawn as she came out of the flowerbeds
1	do you remember our endless happiness ,
1	one day , having gone to vernon to visit his brother , he came across colonel pontmercy on the bridge and recognized the man from saint-sulpice
1	some poor devil , coming back to his hovel later , would find that his door had been opened , sometimes even forced open , in his absence
1	he felt a certain chill
1	does art mean listening or looking , for the art lover ?
1	as he became more successful , invitations rained down on him
1	homuncio , number as plautus would say
1	cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she took care of expenses , which were extremely modest
1	he hasn ’ t come back all day , and you know this is the time he has his dinner
1	you , too , you love me , my cosette
1	it ’ s mine , the lady ?
1	at the rue sainte-croix-de-la-bretonnerie , twenty or so young men , with beards and long hair , went into a bar and came out again a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolour flag covered in crepe ; at their head were three armed men , one with a sword , the second with a fusil , the third with a pike
1	she shut herself away , which her rule allowed her to do , and hid every time she wanted to contemplate it
1	there was no one there but the two of them
1	the inspector merely answered :
1	as she sat down , she noticed , over where she had just been , a rather big stone that had definitely not been there a moment before
1	i ’ ve done twelve leagues
1	this tough , gruff cloister was not so immured , however , that the life of the outside world , with its passions , its drama , and even its novels , did not penetrate
1	he repeated : long live the republic !
1	he thought no more about it
1	she called herself fantine
1	it humiliates me to think i ’ m the same age as that cue ball
1	father madeleine had him carried to an infirmary that he had set up for his workers in the same building as his factory and that was serviced by two sisters of charity
1	that ’ s the sort of dastardly deed they go in for these days
1	father and daughter , arm in arm , had just passed in front of marius ’ s seat
1	huge patrols , composed of regular battalions of the line flanked by whole companies of national guards and preceded by a police commissioner in full regalia , set off to reconnoitre the insurgent streets
1	how could he come to stare into the barricade , only to slink off all atremble saying : actually , i ’ ve had enough of this , i ’ ve seen it , that ’ s enough , it ’ s civil war , i ’ ll be on my way !
1	marius fixed his desperate eyes on that gloomy house , as black and as silent as a tomb , and even emptier
1	fall of the girondins
1	and at the same time he shook off his bonds ; they had been cut
1	when he came back downstairs , the concierge intercepted him : well , then , doctor ?
1	repression , having the army , does not count men and , having vincennes , number does not count shots
1	from behind , against the light , the camera shows us two men on a seat watching the sun go down and the endless movement of the waves
1	marius stepped into his room and slammed the door shut behind him
1	who could have written them ?
1	the four cannons echoed each other dolefully
1	as we said , for a long while monsieur gillenormand ’ s outlook had rubbed him the wrong way
1	javert knew this and venerated her especially because of it
1	he pursued : monsieur le baron , a sewer is not the champ de mars
1	i tell you it is her
1	this pathetic crisis in contemporary history , which parisians like to remember as the days of the riots , is surely a typical moment in the stormy episodes of this century
1	why didn ’ t you say anything ?
1	the position was good and the tavern was handed down from father to son
1	whatever the case may be , the said jean valjean has just been brought before the circuit court of the département of the var charged with committing highway robbery under arms , about eight years ago , on the person of one of those honest children who , as the patriarch of ferneynumber has written in immortal verse ,
1	god the father is there !
1	he was well aware that this was his greatest duty and his greatest work
1	that gave each man fifteen shots to fire
1	marius had gone and sat himself down at a table and was leaning with the corner of his mouth hooked on a curled finger
1	you were quite naked three quarters of the time , my good man
1	the brujon of number was the father of the brujon of number the latter , of whom we only caught a glimpse in the gorbeau ambush , was a strapping young lad , extremely cunning and extremely adroit , with a stunned , mournful look
1	when love has melted and blended two beings in an angelic and sacred unity , the secret of life is open to them ; they are nothing more , then , than the two sides of a single destiny ; they are nothing more than the two wings of a single spirit
1	how many of us are there ?
1	i ’ m not part of yours
1	and he threw a thousand-franc note at thénardier
1	just as well you recognize the fact !
1	he was gay and violent yet , as before , but his gaiety had a convulsive hardness about it as though it contained pain and anger , and his violent outbursts always ended in a sort of sweet and gloomy exhaustion
1	but , for my sake , i want you to know who i am
1	everything is black except the band , which is white
1	it ’ s so you have more stuff worth eating in your sack
1	the great wars of africa and spain , the eradication of the sicilian pirates , the introduction of civilization into gaul , britain , and germany—all that glory spans the rubiconnumber there is a sort of delicacy in divine justice here , when it hesitates to let the formidable historian loose on the illustrious usurper , saving caesar from tacitus and allowing the genius extenuating circumstances
1	every day , at every moment , through the wall , he could hear them walking , coming and going , talking , and he hadn ’ t even listened !
1	at times she laughed as she muttered to herself
1	mother thénardier , petrified and dumb , started in on her conjectures again : what the hell is this old codger ?
1	marius felt this question like a jab to the heart
1	the bolt slid and the gate turned
1	it was new , it was a change
1	he wouldn ’ t for all the world have taken a step toward the little bastard , but he suffered
1	wellington is classic warfare getting its revenge
1	at that moment the young cock ’ s voice of little gavroche rang out through the barricade
1	the postman shouted to the man to stop , but the traveller wouldn ’ t hear of it and went on his way at a rapid trot
1	he did not answer
1	every soldier in the troop was as much a hero as the general
1	what about the surprise ?
1	yet another was killed in the rue grenier-saint-lazare
1	unpleasantness of putting up a pauper who might just be rich
1	now and then , at intervals , when the wind came on , you could vaguely hear cries , a noise , a sort of tumultuous jangling , which was gunfire , and dull knocking sounds , which were cannon blasts
1	i realized my brother was no longer with me
1	he really did have his doubts
1	monsieur , that ’ s what he was angling for ; he ’ s as gentle as a lamb and he rides like the wind
1	for this research , marius was away from home for four days
1	well , hurry up and get her here
1	woe to the defenceless beings around him !
1	they ’ d be nabbed before they fully surfaced
1	preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical slowness ; after which , all hell breaks loose
1	let ’ s see who monsieur marius was
1	but apart from this , his usual diet consisted of little more than boiled vegetables and soup made with olive oil
1	that is nothing more than the passing vanity of torrents swollen by a storm
1	this file of cars , whatever it was , was doleful
1	the timber yard on the rue transnonain was ransacked for barricades
1	just supposing you need me one night , you know where to find me
1	forgive me , i ’ m talking to you , but i don ’ t know what i ’ m saying , perhaps i ’ m annoying you , am i annoying you ?
1	the other man replied with some hesitation , scratching his head under his greek cap : that sounds pretty solid
1	the face stayed in his mind
1	in work like this , everything is dance , dance involving 'bodies without hands , twisted legs , wavering identity expressing who knows what self- hatred '
1	madame has gone out with monsieur and is not back yet , basque told him
1	not being listened to is no reason to keep quiet
1	don ’ t imagine you ’ ve changed much in the universe , just because your trousse-galant , as they used to call it , now goes by the name of cholera morbus , number and just because your bourrée goes by the name of the cachucha
1	illicit love is a sin ; so be it
1	they went and had dinner at rousseau ’ s and spent six francs
1	at every turn , he asked the doctor : there ’ s no danger anymore , is there ?
1	as a young man he had been stationed as a warden in the galleys of the south
1	this is because he has a pearl in his soul , innocence , and pearls do not dissolve in mud
1	the leprosy of monasticism has gnawed to the bone two wonderful nations , italy and spain , one the light , the other the splendour of europe for centuries , and in our day these two illustrious peoples are only just beginning to heal , thanks to the wholesome and vigorous hygiene of number
1	one fine day my heart will fly away ;
1	father fauchelevent , apart from the glory we have just recounted and of which he was completely ignorant , was rewarded for his good deed ; first , he was glad he ’ d done it , it made him happy ; and then , he had a lot less work to do now he was sharing the load
1	he had only to leave things alone
1	i ’ ve had a gut full of misery !
1	he would sit on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit trellis and he would gaze at the stars through the scrawny stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees
1	all of human destiny lies in that particular dilemma
1	turns into manipulation , pure and simple
1	such collisions are constantly taking shape , bringing things together and pulling them apart ; it is a matter of life and death
1	he would have dreaded those sublime peaks from which a few rare , not to say great , men , like swedenborg or pascal , number have slid down into madness
1	in paris , the faubourg saint-marceau was almost as hectic as the faubourg saint-antoine and the schools were buzzing just as much as the faubourgs
1	this one individual alone weighed more than the population of the world
1	she went back to bed , telling herself : that means he ’ s really worried !
1	that cosette continue to love him !
1	this is , let sympathetic souls not forget , the foremost of fraternal obligations ; it is , let self-centred hearts be aware , the first and foremost of political necessities
1	no budding ambition was silly enough to attempt to blossom in his shadow
1	whatever the case may be , even when they have fallen , especially when they have fallen , those men are honourable who , at the four corners of the globe , their eyes fixed on france , fight for the great cause with the inflexible logic of the ideal ; they give their lives as a pure sacrifice for progress ; they carry out the will of providence ; they commit a religious act
1	cosette was a condensation of dawn light in the form of a woman
1	and he grabs his pen
1	and do you have far to go ?
1	not a shutter was pushed open
1	disabled officers followed immediately behind carrying branches of laurel
1	they all wanted to be in on it
1	how to get ahead , succeed—that is the lesson that trickles down , drop by drop , from the overriding corruption on high
1	that ’ s his form of courage , as he says
1	we should say how it got that name
1	there was nothing ahead , nothing behind
1	she pocketed the coin and contented herself with throwing the child a ferocious look , saying :
1	there are earwigs in the ursulines depots , there are millipedes at the panthéon , there are tadpoles in the moats of the champ de mars
1	icy silence inside the fiacre
1	they had stolen , raped , looted , killed , murdered
1	the social order has its starless miners
1	we are not saying that the portrait of the man we offer here is accurate ; we will restrict ourselves to the claim that it is a passing likeness
1	his housekeeper , too , was a permutation on innocence
1	in the throes of violent emotions , you do not read , you wrestle to the ground , so to speak , the piece of paper you are holding , you strangle it like a victim , you crush it , you dig your nails into it with your anger or your delight ; you race to the end , you jump to the beginning ; attention is feverish ; it understands the essential , overall , more or less ; but then it seizes on a point and all the rest disappears
1	meat ’ s dear , ma patagon !
1	it ’ s better , said jean valjean
1	wide open gloomy country where there was no grass
1	but it ’ s cold here
1	what do you want of me ?
1	it imparts to those it seizes some mysterious extraordinary power
1	the silence was now so profound on the side where the attack would surely come that enjolras got everyone to take up their positions once more
1	the shopkeeper who says : montpellier available , marseillesnumber good quality ; the stockbroker who says : carryover rate , premium , end current account ; the gambler who says : a run of three sees you out , spades it is ; the bailiff of the norman isles who says : the enfeoffor who closes on his property can not claim the fruits of this property during the seizure of the immovable property of the defaulting tenant ; the vaudevillian who says : they baited the bear ( for they booed the play ) ; the actor who says : i was a flop ; the philosopher who says : phenomenal triplicity ; the whale hunter who says : there she blows , there she breaches ; the phrenologistnumber who says : amativeness , combativeness , secretiveness ; the foot soldier who says : my clarinette ( for his musket ) ; the horseman who says : my indian chicken ( for his horse ) ; the fencing master who says : tierce , quarte , break ; the printer who says : let ’ s use boldface—all of them , printer , fencing master , horseman , foot soldier , phrenologist , whale hunter , philosopher , actor , vaudeville writer , bailiff , gambler , stockbroker , shopkeeper , all of them are talking slang
1	a deep-rooted and bizarre formation
1	believe me , do not take on the dreadful drudgery of being a layabout
1	that is how they reasoned
1	cosette only dimly remembered her childhood
1	if the supreme being had gven me the talent for it , i could have been the baron thénard , member of the institute ( académie des ciences ) , but i am not
1	but it had forced him nonetheless to wrap up his hand in some linen and to wear his arm in a sling , and so had prevented him from signing anything
1	up you come , kidlingtons !
1	then she was quiet for a moment
1	all of them except laigle were from the south
1	the mob is a traitor to the people
1	gavroche was thinking alongside him
1	to inform on someone , in the vibrant language of slang , is known as manger le morceau , to eat the morsel , the pound of flesh
1	this is where he became alarmed ; his balance was out of whack , the scales tipped ; one of the scale pans toppled into the abyss , the other flew off up into the heavens ; and javert was no less horrified by the one on high than by the one down below
1	let me give you a word of friendly advice
1	they had been put on the bottom floor as a precaution
1	we ’ ll all live together
1	it had to be providence taking on a horrible guise , with the good angel crawling out of the ground in the form of thénardier
1	the whole family , including basque and nicolette , were gathered together in marius ’ s room when cosette came in
1	was he a grandfather ?
1	at the present day , for example , the hybrid ship with propeller is an amazing machine hauled along by sails three thousand square meters in surface and by a number-horsepower boiler
1	the locket opened when you pressed a spring
1	jean valjean , as we say , had his back to the light and was in any case so disfigured , so covered with mud and blood , that at high noon he would have been unrecognizable
1	and those that aren ’ t little rotters are nincompoops !
1	this armchair is for you
1	we were talking about a neighbour we once had who , ever since she ’ d moved into the street , used to always work with her window open
1	god delivers his will as visible in events , an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue
1	fauchelevent fell on his knees
1	mass has not been said here since the carnage
1	one evening—it was the fourth of june , though that did not stop old gillenormand from having a roaring fire going in his fireplace—he had dismissed his daughter , who was quietly sewing in the next room
1	thénardier had gone bankrupt , the inn was closed , and nobody knew what had become of him
1	had he embarked on this amorous adventure that had ended in his marriage to cosette a bit too carelessly to take in his surroundings ?
1	and the mother ’ s pale face would brighten
1	meanwhile , in a matter of minutes , twenty iron bars had been ripped off the grate over the shop front of the tavern , twenty yards of pavement had been ripped up , gavroche and bahorel had seized and tipped over the narrow dray of a lime manufacturer named anceau , this dray containing three barrels full of lime , which they stashed under the piles of cobblestones ; enjolras had lifted up the trapdoor to the cellar and all the widow hucheloup ’ s empty kegs had gone to flank the barrels of lime ; feuilly , with his fingers accustomed to colouring the delicate blades of fans , had buttressed the barrels and the dray with two massive piles of rubble
1	thénardier stood up quietly , went to the fireplace , removed the screen and stood it against the nearby pallet , thereby revealing the stove full of burning charcoal , in which the prisoner could see perfectly clearly the white-hot chisel , dotted here and there with little bright red stars
1	the gravedigger stopped in his tracks
1	marius hardly recognized , in this polite office clerk ’ s smile , the almost bestial maw foaming away in a frenzy only a moment before
1	camille desmoulinsnumber was from the suburbs
1	would she ever find him again ?
1	it will be my little girl
1	it was cosette sobbing
1	the sewer , for instance , rebelled against any itinerary
1	we absolutely must do something about those guns , said enjolras , and he shouted , open fire on the gunners !
1	i ’ ll do all i can to prove my zeal to the community
1	the cart was loaded to the brim
1	let ’ s hope he ’ s at home !
1	apart from this , he had never loved any woman as much as a tulip bulb or any man as much as an elzevir typeface
1	the door yielded to the pressure , silently and imperceptibly opening the gap a little wider
1	and then again , she was no longer the school boarder with her felt hat , her merino wool frock , her school shoes , and her chapped hands ; taste had come to her with beauty ; she was now dressed well with a sort of simple , rich , unmannered elegance
1	then came a motley crowd in countless numbers , excited , strange , the sectionariesnumber of the friends of the people , the school of law , the school of medicine , refugees of all nations , number bearing spanish , italian , german , polish flags , horizontal red-white-and-blue flags and every kind of banner imaginable , children waving branches of greenery , stonemasons and carpenters who were out on strike at that very moment , printers recognizable by their paper caps , walking two by two , three by three , letting out shouts , nearly all of them waving sticks , some sabres , in disarray and yet as one at heart , now a pushing and shoving crush , now a column
1	the best are not exempt from selfish thoughts
1	he removed my cataracts , he said to himself
1	i don ’ t have one
1	enjolras , carrying as he did the whole barricade in his head , held himself in reserve , saving his strength and keeping under cover ; three soldiers in a row fell beneath his battlement without even seeing him
1	and that , to thank him , the prioress would admit his brother into the house as a gardener and his niece as a boarder
1	however much of a dreamer , marius was , as we know , a strong and active person
1	at the corner where the two streets met , a man was standing with his back against a wall
1	respect was complete , unanimous , warm , and friendly , and there came a moment , around number , when the words monsieur le maire were spoken in montreuil-sur-mer in the same tone as the words monseigneur the bishop had been spoken in digne in number people came from thirty miles around to consult monsieur madeleine
1	marius felt proud of this man he didn ’ t know
1	the man picked up again as he ate
1	the students were to deliberate over this
1	i ’ ve read a lot of plato , but none of it has stuck ;
1	and he set his shovel in motion once more
1	gavroche was a gamin of letters
1	the farm buildings border the yard to the south
1	these range from the surrealist images of happiness , whose burlesque lightness of touch seems mockingly to undermine the promises of the official version of happiness , despite the conformism of the script , to the militant images produced by the cine-train , rolling across russia to shoot from life and immediately relay to the interested parties the debates of people taking control of factories , land or housing ; from official images made surrealist – or surrealist images made official ?
1	i so wanted to see you , i ’ ve got special leave
1	the funny thing was that there was another man in the sewer—someone other than himself
1	life , sap , heat , fragrance , spilled over ; you could feel the hugeness of the spring underlying creation ; in all these puffs of air saturated with love , in this to-ing and fro-ing of reverberations and reflections , in this wildly extravagant spree of sunbeams , in this endless outpouring of liquid gold , you could feel the prodigality of the inexhaustible ; and , behind this splendour , as behind a curtain of flame , you caught a glimpse of god , that millionaire in stars
1	and what a stroke of luck that all he did was steal !
1	his ideas began to get tangled up again
1	i ’ m warning you just so you know
1	at that point , as we said , he gave a shudder of revolt
1	one sunday night , maubert isabeau , the baker on the church square in faverolles , was getting ready to go to bed when he heard a loud crash and the sound of breaking glass at the barred window of his shop
1	why am i sticking my oar in ?
1	being hoodwinked by infinity !
1	for several days he had not eaten or slept
1	dévisser le coco , to unscrew the coconut—wring someone ’ s neck ; tortiller , to wolf down—to eat ; être gerbé , to cop it—to be sentenced ; un rat , a rat—a bread thief ; il lansquine , to pelt down daggers—to rain , a striking age-old image that , in a way , bears its own date with it , assimilating the long slanting lines of rain with the thick angled pikes of the lansquenets , and capturing in a single word the popular metonymy : it ’ s raining pitchforks
1	and he tried to pass his arm under her to lift her up
1	and breton 's 'surrealism ' , following hot on the heels of dada , emerged fully arned from the fireworks of the great '\tar where common reality was suddenly transfigured by the magic of explosives and poison gases at y pres and verdun
1	a water jug with a broken neck covered half a wall
1	he had not yet uttered a word , no one seemed to realize he was still there , standing as he was , straight and motionless , behind all these happy people
1	at this word , jean valjean became fierce
1	there is no other
1	who is this man ?
1	it ’ s someone who looks like him
1	a people won ’ t let themselves be pushed around
1	the convent is a compression chamber that has to keep working for an entire life , if it is to triumph over the human heart
1	when he occasionally let loose—and who doesn ’ t ? —with an : oh , if only i were rich ! —it was not ogling some young filly , like old man gillenormand , but gazing at a book
1	i kissed your fresh round arms on the wing
1	i cart madame magloire away , go to my room and i pray for him and i fall asleep
1	and it ’ s extremely urgent
1	a dilemma , the choice between destruction or salvation , which no act of fate poses more inexorably than love does
1	it was at that juncture that the profound observation about a rather greedy parrot who belonged to a lady boarder was made : isn ’ t it cute !
1	at that moment , the dragoons and the crowd came together , face-to-face
1	how could he come this far , only to turn back !
1	your horse is weary , go back to tinques
1	that done , he fainted
1	i ’ m a damned idiot , he said
1	there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the splendours down below among the dregs
1	he was becoming a murderer !
1	how can we ultimately fail to twig that the apparent impiety of contemporary art is only ever the inverted image of sacred art , the reversal of the creator 's initial question : why is there something instead of nothing ?
1	all that could be placed at his disposal was a paltry village sacristy with a few old chasubles of worn-out damask dolled up with imitation braid
1	but there ’ s no danger today
1	he always ate alone , with a book open in front of him , reading
1	you are my master
1	society clamoured for him
1	had he bribed the officer ?
1	there was an all-powerful magnetism between herself and marius that made her , instinctively and almost automatically , do whatever marius wanted
1	favourite went on : oh yes , and i ’ d set the guards on you !
1	was it a fortress ?
1	the bravery was almost barbaric , mixed up as it was with a sort of heroic ferocity that began with self-sacrifice
1	like venice , you will have an artificial power , or like england a material power ; you will be the evil rich
1	too much tin in cast guns makes them oversensitive
1	he had before his eyes an unheard-of vision , a sort of reenactment of the most horrible moment of his life , played by his ghost
1	why doesn ’ t what ’ s-his-name ever hang his keys on the hook on thursdays ?
1	everything about her is fresh , smooth , young , sweet morning light
1	he did not budge from his seat and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg were closing
1	the man unfolded the piece of paper , looked at it , but his mind was clearly elsewhere
1	they both had wings , one the wings of an angel , the other of a goose
1	he ’ s one of the neighbours
1	under the long vaulted corridor that ends in the arche-marion , a rag-and-bone man ’ s sack , perfectly preserved , was the admiration of connoisseurs
1	the thief , too , has his cannon fodder , robbable material—you , me , whoever happens to be passing by , le pantre , sucker , the ordinary everyman
1	god could give me his brightest star ,
1	she had left poverty behind and was embarking on life
1	combeferre lived a much more normal life than enjolras
1	they have given their poor and widows and orphans the right to mow their meadows three days before everyone elsenumber when their houses are tumbling down , they rebuild them for free
1	father , marius plowed on , my good , dear father , if you only knew !
1	in stirring up so many gloomy notions , his courage never failed him but his brain hurt , and he began to think of other things in spite of himself , meaningless things
1	everything has to be over a good quarter of an hour beforehand
1	this is in everyone ’ s interest , not just mine ; i am madeleine , and madeleine i remain
1	he thought they were looking at him because of his old clothes and that they were laughing at him ; the fact is that they looked at him because of his grace , which set them dreaming
1	you could hear them say to one another : where ’ ve you got your pistol ?
1	marius heard the clatter of charcoal being knocked by tongs or some other iron instrument and jondrette continued :
1	the stern ancestor had made way for the grandfather
1	enjolras had gone on reconnaissance
1	from time to time , the man turned and checked whether he was being followed
1	almost all of them show scuff marks from musketry
1	i say , then , that he marched up to the bench the way i ’ d say : hannibal marched on rome
1	in the nineteenth century , religious notions are in turmoil
1	you know the rest
1	he asked cosette : would you like to go to the luxembourg ?
1	o gnawing sex , your pretty little white teeth crave sugar
1	two days in a row was too much
1	why was he in this wood ?
1	this was observed by the bread crumbs that were found on the tiled floor when the law later ordered a search
1	no , answered jean valjean
1	my hands are numb
1	how is monsieur ’ s arm ?
1	you can understand why
1	you could not see his forehead , which was hidden under his hat , you could not see his eyes , which were buried under his eyebrows , you could not see his chin , which was plunged into his cravat , you could not see his hands , which were retracted into his sleeves , you could not see his walking stick , which he carried under his redingote
1	we should say that , in growing old , mademoiselle gillenormand had actually gained more than she had lost
1	accordingly , in the official proceedings of the festival of federation of july , michelet reads the monuments of fledgling fraternity ’
1	you see , what is now the prefecture used to be the bishop ’ s palace before the revolution
1	he had bivouacked at dion-le-mont and set out at dawn
1	in switzerland , this monopoly-holder of the richest princely domains in france had sold an old horse to be able to eat
1	where is this argenteuil ?
1	the paris sewer has been an awesome old thing
1	they are souls with senses
1	but this is the place , if you ’ re looking for lost women , grantaire growled behind his back
1	she ’ s touched it with her filthy hands !
1	from number , he supported and applauded all demonstrations of hostility toward him
1	yes , you murderous swine !
1	wherever a railway station has been set on the edge of a capital city , it has spelled the death of a local neighbourhood and the birth of a township
1	enjolras , who had not said a word till then , broke his silence and addressed courfeyrac : you mean atonement follows hot on the heels of the crime
1	social prosperity means the human being happy , the citizen free , the nation great
1	ah , you ’ re putting on your manly voice , monsieur
1	well , give me a kiss , then
1	dictator , but despot ; despot issuing from a republic and symbolizing a revolution
1	already it was almost too late
1	the saint bartholomewsnumber filter into it , drop by drop , seeping through the cobblestones
1	he had a huge embrace
1	said the ventriloquist , snickering
1	no doubt you ’ re having people over this evening
1	the chapter assembled once a week ; the prioress presided , the vocal mothers attended
1	was he to remain the sort of father , rarely seen but respected , that he had been till then ?
1	since number , it has begun to grow through the staircase
1	they could see a sparkling hedge of bayonets rippling above the barricade
1	i never cease to marvel
1	jean valjean walked along it , though pretty painfully
1	yet i told you to pay attention !
1	a person could spend eternity in such bottomless pits
1	never , since his childhood , since his mother , since his sister , never had he met with a kind word or a kind look
1	he began to move again and strode to the other end of the drawing room
1	the most mediocre listener will do for someone who has been silent far too long
1	a young girl was hoeing and pulling up weeds in a field where a big yellow poster , probably for some fairground show , fluttered and flapped in the wind
1	fortune once smiled on me
1	or else , some miller might be carrying on : are we responsible for what ’ s in the sacks ?
1	taking turns , each nun makes what they call atonement
1	at that moment a bird ’ s-eye view of the crowd would have revealed a sort of comet with its head in the esplanade and its tail fanning out over the quai bourbon covering the bastille and stretching all the way down the boulevard to the porte saint-martin
1	it ’ s all used for the wild animals
1	was it imbecility or a ruse ?
1	this magnon , whose name the reader has already come across , was linked to the thénardiers in a way that will be clarified later , and could , by going to see éponine , serve as a bridge between la salpêtrière and les madelonnettes
1	( haven ’ t pronounced ain ’ t and fifth pronounced fiff )
1	jean valjean had merely passed out
1	it could crack open a bit and save you
1	a kind of letter box had been cut into the shutter of the gatekeeper ’ s window
1	the last shred of doubt had now evaporated
1	she did not have a moment to lose
1	after that , we would see
1	marius more or less went into a delirium
1	ah , right , comrade , while i think of it : how the hell did you manage to get out of the bog back there ?
1	he turned into a little street where there were a lot of gardens
1	and what revolution are we going to bring about ?
1	we couldn ’ t see too well
1	he could feel someone grab him from behind
1	he was to be seen constantly , he was to be heard never-endingly
1	so , for dinner , he tried to sleep
1	to no there is only one answer : yes
1	wandering around like a stray apparently on your own means you are lost
1	during the six years that separated number from number , the prioress of petit-picpus was mademoiselle de blemeur , whose religious name was mother innocent
1	to lie is the absolute of evil
1	the skirt made the thénardiers furious
1	jean valjean had taken no part in the fight except to expose himself to danger
1	the two boys took off , the elder leading the younger and holding in his hand the note that was supposed to be their guide
1	i went to the jail , the doorkeeper wouldn ’ t open
1	monsieur gillenormand was not that kind of man ; his dominance in the royalist salons he frequented did not cost him an iota of self-respect
1	my champmathieu was arrested
1	the future belongs even more to hearts than to minds
1	the first of the wedding berlins contained cosette and aunt gillenormand , monsieur gillenormand , and jean valjean
1	he said more than he should have and finally lost his job
1	cried a jubilant voice
1	he could defend a rabbit hutch from rats just with the smell of a little barbary pig that he ’ d put in
1	i was never rich ; now i am poor
1	she did not come in but stood in the shadows in the hall , where marius saw her through the half-open door
1	jean valjean ’ s visits did not get any shorter
1	certain strange habits , like arriving just as others are leaving , staying in the background while others are showing off , blending into the wall on all occasions , seeking out the lonely lane , preferring the deserted street , not joining in conversations , avoiding crowds and special occasions , seeming fairly well-off yet living in poverty , having your key in your pocket and your candle at the porter ’ s no matter how rich you are , entering by the back door , going up the back stairs—all these insignificant little oddities , wrinkles , air bubbles , fleeting ripples on the surface , often rise up from forbidding depths
1	mother thénardier , éponine , azelma were all so many statues
1	he held all these people in the palm of his hand , unbeknownst to them , as they jerked about , under his nose
1	her eyes looked as though they hadn ’ t been dry in a long while
1	enjolras maintained its divine-right side and combeferre its natural right
1	enjolras had a pistol in his hand
1	the term passive obedience says it all
1	other associations sought to recruit from among the great parent societies
1	anyone seeing him at that moment , in the dark , would have seen how wild-eyed , staggered , and stunned he had become
1	and , placing a pistol on the table , he added : the last one out of here will put a bullet in this spy ’ s skull
1	shove off , will you
1	you would have sworn they were threatening someone and chasing after him
1	to speak or to remain silent : are they to sonority vvhat to show or to hide are to visibility ?
1	duchesses , the most delicate and the most charming women in the world , went into raptures there over couplets like the following , addressed to the federates : number
1	between nine o ’ clock and half past ten , incredible as it seems , the whole army took up position and lined up in six rows , forming , to borrow an expression of the emperor ’ s , the figure of six vs a few moments after the formation of the battlefront , amid that profound silence that is the calm before the storm of a fray , seeing the three batteries of twelve-pounders file past , detached by his orders from the three corps of d ’ erlon , reille , and lobau , and intended to begin the action by battering mont-saint-jean at the intersection of the roads from nivelles and genappe , the emperor clapped haxo on the shoulder and said to him : there ’ s twenty-four beauties for you , general
1	her alcove is hidden in the dark part of the ideal
1	alongside booming radiophony and the live rallies of nuremburg and elsewhere , the talkies would become one of the instruments of choice of the fledgling totalitarianisms
1	but in this gathering together , there is no abdication
1	you can ’ t smell anything of life
1	the noise was coming from the garden
1	to cut ties seems to be an instinct with certain dirt-poor families
1	whereas you , at least , are called théodule ! number
1	an arrondissement of the pas-de-calais has just seen an event out of the ordinary
1	this signature has been forged quite well , he grumbled through his teeth
1	pull up your breeches
1	two lovers hide in the evening , in the twilight , in the invisible , among the birds , among the roses , they fascinate each other in the shadows with their hearts which shine through their eyes , they murmur , they whisper , and all the time the immense wheeling of stars fills infinity
1	they had tremendous fun with puns they thought were fantastic , with plays on innocent words they considered deadly , with quatrains and even distiches ; thus on the dessolles ministry , a cabinet of moderates of which messieurs decazes and deserrenumber were members :
1	cosette jumped as though there had been an earthquake underneath her
1	to struggle in it is ghastly ; while you are fighting for your life , you squelch around paddling
1	the congress of viennanumber made the treaties of number out of it and europe called this the restoration
1	the next day—for he lived only from one next day to the one after that , there were no more todays , so to speak , for him—the next day , as expected , he found no one in the luxembourg ; at dusk , he went to the house
1	where are we right now ?
1	these sheets of paper held twenty-six squares of the same grey paper folded in the form of cartridges , and a card on which the following could be read :
1	he had taken his arm out of the sling and was using his right hand as though it did not hurt a bit
1	i asked you where you ’ re going , you scoundrel
1	he had enlightened marius by chance and unwittingly , like a candle that someone happens to be carrying ; he had been the candle and not the someone
1	soon , he did not even go as far as the rue saint-louis
1	jeanne and her hard breton
1	they went in through the gates , visited the statue of the anchoritenumber in its grotto , gave themselves a few thrills in the famous hall of mirrors , a lascivious snare fit for a satyr-cum-millionaire or a turcaret metamorphosed into priapusnumber they rattled the swing that hung from two chestnuts celebrated by the abbé de bernisnumber while he gave each gorgeous girl a turn on the swing , one after the other , amid general hilarity due to a flying up of skirts that would have been grist for the mill for greuze , number the toulousian tholomyès , who was something of a spaniard , toulouse being a sister city of tolosa , sang to the tune of a melancholy lament the old gallega songnumber probably inspired by some beautiful girl zooming high in the air on a rope between two trees :
1	through the black words delivered , he glimpsed only one thing at all clearly and that was that an ambush was being set up , an obscure but terrible ambush ; that they were both in serious danger , she probably , her father for sure ; that they had to be saved , that the hideous schemes of the jondrettes had to be undone and the web of these spiders torn down
1	if i had my way , it would be gallantly chic
1	it was a retreat open to one to whom all doors were closed
1	as for the young lady , they won ’ t hurt her , the boneshaker will take her to a place where she ’ ll be nice and cosy and , as soon as you ’ ve given me the paltry sum of two hundred thousand francs , she ’ ll be handed back to you
1	for my son—the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo
1	you saw no one
1	the elbows had gone white with that fluffy down that friction leaves on fabric
1	little white paternoster , that god made , that god said , that god put in paradise
1	but where are the snows of yore ?
1	he stood between the grave and the gravedigger , crossed his arms , and said : i ’ m paying !
1	friends of the abc
1	his eyes grew bigger and shone with the light of the pride he felt inside
1	the lady was sleeping
1	a century under a wimple
1	a retrograde movement took place , the battlefront of the english slipped away , wellington backed off
1	faith in the stars melded to the science of strategy , expanding it but also muddying it
1	i understand him without his needing to speak and we put ourselves in the hands of providence
1	the mayor does everything
1	monsieur madeleine in mourning
1	if it hadn ’ t been for the novels she had read , which , at times , bizarrely brought out the snooty little prude beneath the ogress , the idea of calling her a woman would never have occurred to anyone
1	after a few moments , he was no longer blind
1	it was built in such a way that the combatants could , at will , either disappear behind the barrier or peer over it or even scramble up on top of it by means of four rows of cobblestones laid on top of each other and arranged in tiers on the inside like a flight of steps
1	suddenly , she dissolved in tears
1	think about that , if you will
1	paltry coins , stones , corpses , ghosts , worthless thingsnumber
1	can it really be that you ’ re good for something ?
1	the bandits had recovered from their initial surprise
1	when he reached adulthood , he became a tree pruner in faverolles
1	to scale a sheer vertical wall and find toeholds and handholds in places where you could barely see a bump was child ’ s play for jean valjean
1	and monsieur wants to get there today ?
1	three days to go and get this poor woman ’ s child !
1	there are dogged and unseen acts of bravery , which defend themselves every inch of the way behind the scenes against the deadly invasion of necessity and depravity
1	they threw a long black shawl belonging to the widow hucheloup over father mabeuf
1	he defended himself badly , but was that a reason to convict him ?
1	anyone who has seen fireworks will recall the spray made by the crossfire of flashing explosions known as a bouquet
1	that , at least , is what she believes , but it is a mistake to imagine that you can exhaust fate or that you ever hit rock bottom—in anything
1	tie me up however you like , but you could lay me down on a table , like that other man
1	who loves well lashes well
1	she will not listen
1	despite the care he had taken so that the money would not be heard rattling around , a hundred-sou coin slipped out of his hands and rolled noisily across the tiles
1	we ’ ll have a small garden , to start with !
1	what is all this ?
1	without replying , the man fumbled in his pocket and thénardier watched as the wallet with the banknotes reappeared
1	through all this , he got himself admitted to the bar
1	at that moment , a drop of wax fell on gavroche ’ s finger and brought him back to life ’ s realities
1	the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four stone walls that entomb him is a sort of icy chastity ; he calls the dungeon , le castus , the castrator
1	they idolized each other
1	because the region ’ s dangerous ; it ’ s full of cannibals
1	she usually grabbed a whole array of them , meaning , seven girls , from ten to sixteen years old , with graded voices and sizes , and made them sing standing side by side in a row , ranged according to age from the smallest to the biggest
1	the texture of the language or the pictorial pigment belong to a history of matter in which all matter is a potentiality of form
1	just as the soldier aimed at marius , a hand planted itself over the end of the gun barrel and blocked it
1	the soldier ’ s bayonet had disappeared
1	they must always speak softly and walk with their eyes on the ground and the head bowed
1	we can only think with horror of those countries where fakirs , bonzes , santons , caloyers , marabouts , talapoins , and dervishesnumber pullulate like swarms of vermin
1	the whole setup was like an eskimo tent
1	the alcove had very conveniently turned into a spy-hole
1	v deeds from which history emerges and which history ignores
1	is it its philosophy ?
1	she did not know who to turn to anymore
1	look at our poor street riddled with bullets
1	gazing at your fresh face in your old mirror !
1	the man no longer even seemed old to her , or poor
1	hougoumont has two gates : the south gate , which is that of the château , and the north gate , that of the farm
1	this is because france is an artist
1	while he was flailing about , did he have any real idea what his adventure in digne might mean for him ?
1	not many of us emerge from them in our right minds and firm in our sense of duty
1	what if i were actually pretty ?
1	he , the pauper , was rich ; he , the abandoned , had a family ; he , the hopeless , was marrying cosette
1	he had a room the way a bird has a branch
1	who brought about this revolution ?
1	you ’ re going to come with us
1	the men piled up on the drays let themselves be jolted along in silence
1	he shed hot tears , he sobbed , more helpless and fragile than any woman , more terrified than any child
1	at his death , as it was the only remotely fine linen he had at his place , they had buried him in it
1	simply , in the vacuum of explanations , flaubert has found a way of taking a room in a normandy farmhouse and , in its place , deploying the great vacuum , the great ennui ’ , of the oriental desert he is in love with , that infinity of grains of sand that is itself just like the vacuum that tosses atoms around indiscriminately
1	the monastery is the outcome of the formula : equality , fraternity
1	it seemed to her , and this caused her a feeling of glee still utterly childish , that she was about to get revenge at last
1	although the man had , literally , slipped into the room , he could not prevent monsieur leblanc from spotting him
1	between seven and eight , the doctor came
1	courfeyrac , helping to demolish the tavern all the while , sought to console the widow who owned it
1	he repeated , as though talking to himself : the convent of petit-picpus !
1	the year number was , however , indicated by two objects that were in vogue at the time with the middle class and were sitting on a table , to wit , a kaleidoscope and an iridescent tin lamp
1	what it thereby accompanies on screen is a minute yet decisive change in the appearance of the faces and attitudes of the colonized , in the happiness ’ they express : they respond to the surprise of these imposed exercises with attention , with a certain pride in playing the game , as perfectly as possible , before the blackboard at school or the iron at the forge
1	and if he turned nasty , i ’ d have roasted him alive !
1	he did not need any further signs
1	the symptoms of new life are obvious
1	we don ’ t have the time to read the novels of monsieur paul de kocknumber anyway , the light could get under the cracks in the porte cochère and all the cops ’ d have to do is look
1	i want to see my child right now !
1	he had ducked out through mondétour lane , winding his way along the houses
1	perhaps it was just a draft
1	marius knocked on the porte cochère , went in , and asked the porter : the gentleman on the third floor ?
1	these two ropes could clearly be seen against the sky like hairs
1	he ripped out a page from it and pencilled these few lines :
1	for some little time jean valjean had noticed the cramped life the young couple led
1	where could non-being set itself up if everything is visible ?
1	she performed , he directed
1	and then , this morning the wind wasn ’ t blowing my way
1	this one is absolutely unmistakable
1	only , this voice now seemed no more than a breath
1	three minutes later , they were out of the grave
1	thénardier went on , hoisting the old rag that served him as a cravat up as far as his adam ’ s apple , a gesture that completes the capable air of a man to be reckoned with : actually , you probably acted wisely
1	no one had ever known her to have a father or a mother
1	the rest ’ s my business
1	the voyage is long and dear
1	what was this : to go back to jail , beside this : to sink into oblivion ?
1	my dear general , said gavroche , i ’ m going to fetch the doctor for my wife who ’ s in labour
1	he wrote the following letter under fantine ’ s dictation and got her to sign it :
1	in that shady freemasonry of evil of which she was a part , everything is known , secrets are kept , and they all help each other out
1	his conscience , meaning , god
1	what was he doing in the montfermeil region ?
1	beyond this dense mass , in the rue du roule , in the rue des prouvaires , and in the extended part of the rue saint-honoré , there was not a single window with a candle burning in it
1	even at death ’ s door , a person can still be dazzled
1	just as conflagrations light up the whole city , revolutions light up the whole human race
1	and so she reached the bench
1	he got away eight years ago , no one knows how , though they kept looking for him
1	in the meantime , monsieur madeleine had gone home
1	the sister turned her steady , sad eyes on fantine , and said : monsieur le maire has gone away
1	'to humanize oneself is to universalize oneself from within ' , they say
1	people like that , no one knows what they live on
1	well , well , it ’ s you !
1	the first was that he now had a horror of this house where he had seen , so very close and in all its most repulsive and its most ferocious variations , a social deformity perhaps even more awful than the evil rich : the evil poor
1	in tholomyès there was a prosecutor and in courfeyrac a paladinnumber
1	it ’ s prettier , better , and cheaper
1	i saw his passport
1	the numbernd regiment of foot guards had lost five lieutenant colonels , four captains , and three ensigns ; the numberst battalion of the numberth infantry had lost twenty-four officers and one hundred and twelve soldiers ; the numberth highlanders had twenty-four officers wounded , eighteen officers dead , and four hundred and fifty soldiers killed
1	let 's go back to the celebrated text in which kurt schwitters describes the foundation of merz just after the great war : i had to shout my joy throughout the world
1	the doctor listened to fantine ’ s chest with his stethoscope , accordingly , and shook his head
1	he came out and put up this barricade
1	at the most unpredictable moment and without his having stopped walking in a straight line , he noticed he was no longer going uphill ; the water of the stream churned at his heels instead of coming at his toes
1	his company , the very one that had shot down the poet jean prouvaire , was the first of the battalion posted at the corner of the street
1	i found plenty to occupy myself
1	she turned her soul into a block of marble that she called joan of arc
1	there is almost always a squad of small-time abbés around a bishop , just as there is a covey of junior officers around a general
1	the one with his arm hooked up in a black cravat ?
1	he hears sounds unfamiliar to man that seem to come from beyond the earth—from some unimaginable and awful otherworld
1	when the clock struck two in the morning , she declared herself defeated and said to her husband : i ’ m going to bed
1	unless it ’ s the other old geezer
1	x the strategy of denial
1	first midnight rang out from the parish church , then from the mairie
1	but we ’ ve got to earn our living
1	one day , while his daughter was tidying up the cups and vials on the marble top of the chest of drawers , monsieur gillenormand leaned over marius and said to him in the most loving tone : you see , my darling marius , if i were you , i ’ d be eating meat now rather than fish
1	one hour later , in the dead of night , two men and a child presented themselves at no
1	what a good night for a getaway !
1	while the men were making cartridges and the women lint , while a large saucepan , full of molten pewter and lead destined for the bullet mould , was smoking on a burning stove , while the scouts were keeping watch over the barricades with their weapons on their arms , while enjolras , whom nothing could distract , was watching over the scouts , combeferre , courfeyrac , jean prouvaire , feuilly , bossuet , joly , bahorel , and a few others besides sought each other out and came together as in their most tranquil schooldays when they would huddle together , chattering , and in a corner of the tavern that had been turned into a casemate , two feet from the redoubt they had put up , their primed and loaded carbines resting on the backs of their chairs , these beautiful young men , so near their final hour , began to recite a love poem
1	what is a mêlée ?
1	his manners were reserved , frigid , polite , not particularly open
1	he says it ’ s urgent
1	there , she was a little girl again , she ran around almost frolicking , she took her hat off , sat it on jean valjean ’ s knees , and gathered bouquets of flowers
1	i history of corinthe from its foundation
1	the bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down
1	there are so many uphill stretches to climb
1	what makes saint françois de sales popular with worldly types is that he cheated at cards
1	there ’ s always the apples from the apple tree
1	the purse fell on father mabeuf ’ s foot
1	then his venerable white head dropped onto the bed , his stoical old heart broke , he buried his face , so to speak , in cosette ’ s clothes , and if anyone had passed on the stairs at that moment , they would have heard the sound of heartrending sobs
1	my motive is strange
1	what makes such a conjecture perfectly plausible is that the buttoned-up man , spotting from the embankment an empty fiacre going past , signalled to the driver , and the driver understood , evidently realized with whom he was dealing , turned around and began to follow the two men from the quai at a slow trot
1	it ’ s a fateful name that floats in the night ; if it stops and falls on someone ’ s head , too bad for that person !
1	it was held shut by a pair of decrepit double doors adorned with a rusty old knocker
1	marius had combed the countryside ; he had gone to chelles , bondy , gournay , nogent , lagny
1	you see , he said
1	my missus in bed !
1	sister , don ’ t tell me i mustn ’ t talk
1	that terrible june number lives on ; the artificial hill monument fades from view , the nondescript lion evaporates , the battlefield resumes its reality ; lines of infantry snake across the plain , furious galloping stirs up the horizon ; the startled dreamer sees the lightning flash of sabres , the glint of bayonets , the blazing of bursting shells , the monstrous crossfire of thunderbolts ; he hears the dim clamour of the phantom battle , like a death rattle from the depths of the grave ; these shades are the grenadiers ; these gleams are cuirassiers ; this skeleton is napoléon ; that skeleton is wellington ; all this is no more and yet the slaughter continues ; and the ravines run red with blood and the trees shiver and the fury rises up to the skies , and in the darkness , all these wild and wind-blasted heights , mont-saint-jean , hougoumont , frischemont , papelotte , planchenoit , appear crowned by blurry whirlpools of spectres exterminating each other
1	to be always peaceful is no more the province of progress than of a river ; don ’ t throw up a dam there , don ’ t throw in a rock ; any obstruction makes the water roil and makes humanity boil over
1	an armed mob went by while a frightened mob looked on
1	the man felt something like an electric shock
1	this fact noted , we push on
1	in cantons where people had a taste for litigation and where farmers went broke over engraved stationery , number he would say , look at the fine peasants of the valley of queyras
1	he was silent again and then he resumed : we hop over walls and we don ’ t give two hoots about the government
1	do what you like with me , but first help me get him home
1	this happened to him whenever he was really agitated
1	mother hucheloup did not seem to much appreciate the benefit of this compensation they were getting for her
1	i was fifty francs short

1	as for us , if we were forced to choose between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized representatives of barbarity , we would go for the barbarians
1	homer says : then diomed cut the throat of axylus , son of teuthranis , who lived in happy arisbe ; euryalus , son of mecisteus , wiped out dresos and opheltios , then turned and went for aesepus and pedasus , twins the naiad abarbarea bore the lofty bucolion ; ulysses overthrows pidytes of percote ; antilochus , ablerus ; polypaetes , astyalus ; polydamas , otus of cyllend ; and teucer , aretaon
1	you don ’ t seem happy to see me ?
1	this extremist simplification in which 'ornament is a crime ' , has stayed with us throughout the history of the twentieth century , from the pointlessly repeated assault on the peaks of the chemin des dames in to the genocide perpetrated by the khmer rouge in cambodia in the s avant-garde artists , like many political agitators , propagandists and demagogues , have long under- stood what terrorism would soon popularize : if you wan t a place in arevolutionary his tory ' there is nothing easier than provoking a riot , an assault on propriety , in the guise of art
1	good god , no , monsieur !
1	in , iossef pasternak went to the russian town of efremov which , for chekov , turgenev and tolstoy , symbolized the eternal somnolence of provincial russia ( phantom efremov )
1	four quarters would have meant only forty francs , and he could not owe four quarters since only six months ago marius had paid two
1	but no matter how careful she had been , cosette did not realize that one of the doll ’ s feet was sticking out and that the fire in the grate was shining very brightly on it
1	when she finds out—
1	the man had melted into the forest and into the gloom
1	it seemed to him that she reproached him for sitting there for so long without coming to her and that she was saying : i ’ ll come to you if you won ’ t come to me
1	the triangle consisting of the apex of the a between the two downstrokes and the horizontal stroke is the mont-saint-jean plateau
1	mother thénardier , frantic and terrible , spread her legs , bent backward , and furiously hurled the cobblestone at javert ’ s head
1	the professor was calling the roll
1	there you have the age in a nutshell
1	jean valjean saw right away that thénardier did not recognize him
1	you know what little father lenoir is ?
1	what man has not , at least once in his life , plummeted into that dark cave of the unknown ?
1	but the wall of the covered way of la force followed a jagged and uneven line ; it had ups and downs , it dipped down at the fire station , it rose up again at the bathhouse , it was intersected by buildings , it was not the same height at the hôtel lamoignon as on the rue pavée , it had sudden drops and right angles everywhere ; and then , the sentries would have seen the fugitive ’ s black silhouette ; on that score , the route taken by thénardier still remains virtually inexplicable
1	it could only end up disempowering the graphic arts due to their lack of sound
1	babylon has no ideal
1	he stepped into the room
1	marius could have left that same night and been at his father ’ s side the following morning
1	it was , i repeat , the sixth of june ; it could have been eight o ’ clock in the evening
1	at the back of the house , a quarter-acre garden
1	the cart fell into one rut after another
1	it imposes its caricatures on the people as much as its ideals ; the most noble monuments of human civilization accept its sarcastic comments and lend their eternity to its risqué remarks
1	the ferment turned to boiling
1	they put them there so they ’ ll rot faster !
1	i put the purse in my pocket
1	they had reached that irreversible and unrepeatable moment , the dazzling point where youth and joy meet and achieve perfection
1	those old crones would put their hands out for alms at any opportunity
1	he used to say , the poor don ’ t lose anything by it
1	it was all over
1	but if you will just bear with us a moment longer and accept that there is in every human being one of the species of the animals of creation , it will be easy for us to say exactly what this officer of the peace , javert , was
1	several question marks regarding a man named le cabuc who was perhaps not le cabuc
1	championnet , number who abused miracles , was a child of the streets of paris ; when still very little , he flooded the porticoes of saint-jean-de-beauvais and saint-étienne-du-mont , and he was on such intimate terms with saint geneviève ’ s shrine as to order about saint januarius ’ s glass vial , causing the blood to suddenly liquefy at will
1	he stood there for a minute without anyone ’ s being aware of his presence
1	then listen to this :
1	repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge boxes
1	once , when i saw the mantillas
1	he went to bed only after he had carefully brushed his coat and folded it away
1	are not we really talking about a form of necro-technology aimed at ensuring one firm 's monopoly ?
1	and dumb in palaiseau ,
1	in floréal , number this enormous bushland , free behind its gate and within its four walls , began to rut in the mute labour of universal germination , quivering in the rising sun almost like an animal gulping in the effluvia of cosmic love and feeling the april sap rise and boil in its veins ; it shook its extravagant green hair in the wind , scattered over the wet ground , over the worn statues , over the crumbling steps of the villa and even over the pavement in the deserted street , flowers like stars , dew like pearls , fecundity , beauty , life , joy , perfume
1	and so on and so forth
1	monsieur le baron is infallible , he said in a clear voice free of any nasal twang
1	the lark and the man had been seen heading in the direction of livry
1	there was an ineffable moment
1	this is what it was :
1	the shops were open , the gas was burning under the arcades , women were buying up in the boutiques , people were having ice cream in the café laiter , they were eating little cakes in the english pastry shop
1	these theorists , smart people in other respects , have a very simple method
1	the wall was bare ; the room was unfurnished , with not a single chair
1	then a shocking thing happened : it sank back into the shadows
1	it ’ s not for myself that i do what i do !
1	add to this the elimination of parasites , and it will be resolved
1	cried the prisoner in an explosive voice
1	and by a tragic twist of fate that caused all his notions to totter and almost caused him to lose his mind , it was another self who was there !
1	mother thénardier would say
1	cosette had permission to go and spend an hour each day with him
1	he had lost his mother and his father when he was very young
1	he made his way through the bushes to the recess near the steps
1	and they accept this hopeless fight and their own stoical disappearance as a means of bringing the magnificent movement of humanity irresistibly begun on july number , number , to its splendid and supreme universal conclusion
1	however , there was always a fog hanging over these leaders , and no actual fact could shore up the odd pride of this response made later by a defendant before the court of peers : number
1	isolation , detachment from everything , pride , independence , a love of nature , lack of any daily physical activity , living for himself , the secret struggles of chastity , benign rapture before all creation—all had prepared marius for this possession we call passion
1	however—and this is a necessary qualification regarding the meaning certain words might convey in too absolute a manner—there can be nothing truly infallible in a human being , and the peculiarity of instinct is precisely its capacity for being clouded , thrown off scent , led astray
1	maybe you ’ re not even a curé ?
1	at dessert , monsieur gillenormand got to his feet , a glass of champagne in hand , only half full so that the tremor of his ninety-two years would not cause it to spill , and toasted the health of the bride and groom
1	napoléon gallops all the way along the rows of fugitives , haranguing them , pressuring them , threatening them , imploring
1	whoever says this three times at night , three times in the morning , will get to paradise in the end
1	it ’ s not that they don ’ t want to , a voice piped up
1	i said to this man : what is this place ?
1	one night he went so far as to gobble up a hundred francs dining with some scatterbrain , which inspired him to utter this memorable phrase in the middle of his orgy : five-gold-louis woman , pull off my boots !
1	suffering begets rage ; and while the prosperous classes turn a blind eye or nod off , which is always the same thing as shutting your eyes , the hate of the unprosperous classes has its torch lit by some malcontent or warped mind dreaming away in a corner somewhere , and it begins to examine society
1	he looked up at the sky and a tear formed slowly in his eye
1	the first day he would eat the meat , the second day he would eat the fat , the third day he would gnaw the bone
1	the rags with which he decked people out were roughly convincing
1	i was a fool
1	this time the warning was understood
1	drunkenness coming to an end is like a curtain ripped down
1	fauchelevent took jean valjean ’ s two robust hands in his old trembling wrinkled hands and it was some seconds before he could speak
1	this tavern made a joyous racket on the very spot old théophilenumber noted in these two lines :
1	never mind , the old geezer with the thing on his mitt , i ’ m sure i know him
1	as he was about to grab this bar , a hand shot out suddenly from the shadows and clapped itself on his arm
1	at that moment , the bludgeoning , multiplied by a hundred hands , was reaching a crescendo and extended to include whacking with the flats of swords ; the galley slaves crouched down , bent double , under this storm of whips and clubs ; a ghastly obeisance was produced by the torture and all fell silent , with the look of chained wolves
1	keep the eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand
1	little by little , however , dim outlines began to form and hold their shape in his mind and he could perceive with the precision of reality , not the situation in its entirety , but some of the details
1	you want to take the thunderclap to task
1	jean valjean thought that other bandits were perhaps hidden in some recess , not far away , and that thénardier was not too keen to share any spoils with them
1	he was a mastiff watching a thief
1	when , in this mysterious travail , he had completely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin , when he had stripped off the aristocrat , the jacobin , and the royalist , when he was fully revolutionary , profoundly democratic , and almost republican , he went to an engraver on the quai des orfèvres and ordered from him a hundred calling cards bearing this name : baron marius pontmercynumber
1	he came to the lane , recognized the apple tree , checked the fruit shed , examined the hedge ; a hedge is a leg up
1	someone ’ s coming , said the prowler , making a move as though to go
1	a native of provence , he had easily picked up all the different dialects of the south
1	the distress of the people ; labourers with no bread ; the last prince de condé vanishing into the shadows ; brussels chasing nassau outnumber the way paris chased the bourbons ; belgium offering itself to a french prince and handed over to an english prince ; the russian hatred of nicholas ; at our rear two demons from the south , ferdinand in spain , miguel in portugal ; the earth quaking in italy , metternich extending his hand over bologna ; france manhandling austria at ancona ; in the north the mysteriously sinister sound of a hammer nailing polandnumber back into its coffin ; in all of europe furious eyes on france ; england , a suspect ally , ready to shove over whatever might bend and to throw itself on whatever might fall ; the peerage taking refuge behind beccaria just to keep four heads from the law ; the fleur-de-lis scratched off the king ’ s carriage , the cross torn down from notre-dame ; number lafayette diminished , laffitte ruined , benjamin constant dead in dire poverty , casimir périer dead in the exhaustion of power ; the political disease and the social disease breaking out at the same time in the two capitals of the realm , the one the city of thought , the other the city of work : in paris , civil war , in lyon , servile war ; in both cities , the same laval glare of the furnace ; the crimson of the crater reflected on the forehead of the people ; the south fanaticized , the west churned up ; the duchesse de berry in the vendée ; number plots , conspiracies , uprisings , cholera , added to the grim noise of ideas the grim tumult of events
1	yet she felt something inside that resembled hope and joy and that wafted upward to the heavens
1	but boulatruelle ’ s shenanigans in the woods stopped and he went back to his regular hours as a road-mender
1	monsieur gillenormand followed him with his eyes and the moment the door opened and marius was about to go out , he darted forward four steps with that senile vivacity imperious and spoiled old men have , grabbed marius by the collar , marched him back energetically into the room , threw him into an armchair and said to him : tell me about it !
1	the maréchal , training his field glasses that way , had answered : four or five thousand men , sire
1	the girls trilled and twittered away like warblers who ’ d escaped from their cages
1	this is working well , said bossuet to enjolras
1	the bishop had not closed it
1	to understand what is about to follow , we have to remember that at this time the bastille guardhouse was located on the other side of the square and that what happened near the elephant could not be seen or heard by the sentinel
1	he said to himself
1	you see how they ’ ve stuck a bell on my shank as if i was some kind of wild beast
1	it had exploited cleverly enough the nation ’ s weariness and the hate mothers felt
1	sister simplice did not have a mirror ; she rummaged through a chest and pulled out a little mirror the infirmary doctor used to check if a patient was dead , no longer breathing
1	his sister got an annuity of five hundred francs , which was enough for her personal expenses , living at the presbytery
1	solve these two problems , encourage the rich and protect the poor , eliminate misery , put an end to the unjust exploitation of the weak by the strong , curb the iniquitous jealousy of the man on the way up for the man who has arrived , adjust , in a manner that is both mathematical and fraternal , wages to work , add free and compulsory education to the growth of the child and make science the basis of manhood , develop the intelligence while keeping the hands busy , be at once a powerful nation and a family of happy people , democratize property ownership , not by abolishing it but by universalizing it , so that every citizen without exception is a property owner , which is easier to do than you think , in short , work out how to produce wealth and work out how to parcel it out , and you will have material greatness and moral greatness all in one—and you will be worthy of calling yourselves france
1	she dropped the swaddled sword , which only half satisfied her , and ran her eyes slowly around the room
1	he turned round now and then to have a look
1	those words , monsieur le maire , had a strange effect on fantine
1	enjolras remained lost in thought
1	monsieur le maire , it ’ s just on five o ’ clock
1	you ’ ll come and have a drink with me
1	monsieur gillenormand went on : cannons in the courtyard of the museum !
1	this was the last swing of the pendulum
1	for a few seconds , jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by all that awesome yet soft serenity ; such moments of forgetting occur ; suffering stops harassing the miserable ; all worry slips away ; peace wraps the dreamer like night ; and in the glow of twilight the soul twinkles with stars , mimicking the sky as it lights up
1	although not one person was moving , you could hear shuffling in the mud
1	that was eight years ago ; yet it seemed to him only yesterday
1	when she had read it thoroughly , she kissed it and tucked it inside her corset
1	poor devils , he said
1	everyone was in tears
1	who could these pages come from ?
1	is there a straw we won ’ t clutch at when we feel ourselves drowning ?
1	in a week we will be in england
1	no grant from the king to the people
1	but this scraping job had weakened the bolting on the hull
1	where can he possibly have got to ?
1	besides , a lawyer can always be found
1	the conventionist began to gasp for breath ; the asthma produced by approaching death , which makes the last intakes of air so laboured , broke up his voice , and yet the perfect lucidity of his soul shone on in his eyes
1	it was the cemetery gates closing
1	they tied the bandits up
1	the reason is that symmetry spells boredom and boredom is the very essence of grief
1	wellington had backed off
1	though he never admitted it to himself , for it would have made him furious and ashamed , monsieur gillenormand had never loved any mistress the way he loved marius
1	everything would smash to smithereens , most likely , but at least then no one ’ d have anything , and that ’ d be something !
1	it is the fictional play of the significant and the a-significant , and its cinematographic application to the play of the double gaze , that give the image its documentary power
1	the tall man that courfeyrac , combeferre , and enjolras had noticed the moment he approached the crowd at the corner of the rue des billettes was making himself useful working on the small barricade
1	you have to be used to the twists of fate and being caught up in them to dare lift your eyes when certain questions appear in all their horrible starkness
1	it puts on word-masks and rag-metaphors
1	when you ’ re as lovesick as a tiger , the least you can do is fight like a lion
1	again the old biddies were not at a loss for words : the man ’ s a clod , quite uneducated
1	she went on : friends !
1	that was where his bed was
1	marius was dying and jean valjean worn out
1	napoléon is dead , said a passerby to one of the war wounded from marengo and waterloo
1	yesterday there was appetite , today there is fullness , tomorrow there will be satiety
1	it will come , citizens , the day when all will be peace , harmony , light , joy , and life , it will come
1	but just you try and prove anything !
1	but the failure of the genre painter to rise to history painting also heralds a time when it is genre painting , the repre­sentation of nondescript lives , that will be the exemplary manifestation of historicity
1	and lieutenant théodule woke up
1	jean valjean had already forgotten the means he had used to get cosette to stay quiet
1	the english guards lay in ambush in these rooms ; the spiral staircase , split from the ground floor right up to the roof , looks like the inside of a broken shell
1	if ever the sic vos non vobisnumber was applicable , it surely is to the village of waterloo
1	what are you doing turning up here , since it ’ s a no-go ?
1	at those words , coming once more from jean valjean , all that was welling up in marius ’ s heart found an outlet and he burst out : cosette , do you hear that ?
1	jean valjean was immediately sent to toulon jail
1	it ’ s thanks to the paris faubourien that revolution conquers europe , once the armies get involved
1	from that day forth , they adored each other
1	what could he do ?
1	can the soul be entirely remade by destiny and become bad if that destiny is bad ?
1	so then blondeau looks at me with the sweet smile of a tiger and he says : if you are pontmercy , you are not laigle
1	bahorel , in ecstasies over the barricade , cried : there ’ s the street nicely cropped off for you !
1	the ideal for javert was not to be humane , to be great , to be sublime ; it was to be irreproachable
1	d like hamlet reinterpreted by the east german defector heine muller , the warhol-machine no longer has something to say about the 'worker ' , but only about the 'unemployed '
1	there will be only the four cantor mothers , mother ascension , and you in the chapel
1	do you mean greece ?
1	the driver , foreseeing a long wait , fitted the muzzles of his horses into the nosebag of oats , wet at the bottom , which is so familiar to parisians , being—this said in brackets—something the various governments sometimes apply to them
1	he came to a wall
1	no conjecture was possible
1	here is what marius heard : listen carefully
1	do not they also say that , on the night of new year 's eve , the 'post-mortem ' duo of bob marley and his daughter-in-law , lauren hill , could be heard all over new y ork ?
1	this was a moment beyond words for jean valjean
1	in it , ordinary life is represented – that is , supplanted – by its materials themselves , by the detritus that gives it its concrete texture
1	it begins with a kiss , said blachevelle
1	at home , except when he got up or went to bed , he never wore a dressing gown
1	what are you trying to say ?
1	then he crossed the overcoat over in front : the coat ’ s too big , of course … never mind , he added
1	without limits , there is no value ; without value , there is no esteem , no respect and especially no pi ty : death to the referee !
1	marius ’ s arms were hanging around his neck and his feet dangling behind him
1	now , no blade is simple
1	this man was ready-made
1	the father asked : which cheek did he slap ?
1	give me your orders , most reverend mother
1	where have all the beautiful girls gone ,
1	you boo the victim to encourage him
1	when a being that is dear to us is about to die , you look at them with a look that clings to them in an effort to hold them back
1	the troops broke down the doors of houses from which there had been firing
1	and at a sign from courfeyrac , the mob rushed into the rue de la chanvrerie
1	the fiend dimly takes shape ; it is every man for himself
1	the hour had sounded in the nick of time
1	second , yes or no , are you the freed convict jean valjean ?
1	my name is euphrasie
1	it was the first time since they were married that she had dared criticize an act of the master
1	the snow was falling twice as heavily and filled the air
1	in just a few minutes , the mob with its thousand hands had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty fusils , nearly all double-barrelled , sixty-four swords , and eighty-three pistols
1	why haven ’ t you put her in my bed so that i ’ d see her the moment i opened my eyes ?
1	in a quiet , humdrum situation , thénardier had all it takes to play—we do not say to be—what passes for an honest tradesman , a decent burgher
1	we ’ re still in the rue de l ’ homme-armé
1	gavroche was still holding the cellar rat in his hand
1	this woman , as far as anyone could tell , must once have loved this man with whatever quotient of love was in her ; but most likely , in the daily mutual rage provoked by the awful distress that ground the family down , that love had died
1	he wants to give me a surprise
1	they were thirsty ; guillaume brought them something to drink
1	like you , reverend mother
1	regardless of the state , regardless of the laws , regardless of the prosperity and the insolence of others
1	it was a tilbury attached to a small white horse
1	fauchelevent cried out : lord !
1	marius asked : where ’ s the chief ?
1	the fleming called his wife and told her all about it
1	of course , despotism remains despotism , even under the despot of genius
1	bruneseau had set things in motion , but it needed choleranumber to spur the vast reconstruction that has taken place since
1	study evil amicably , note it , then cure it
1	one day cosette accidentally looked at herself in the mirror and let out a cry : well !
1	sire , said the minister of the interior to napoléon , yesterday i saw the boldest man in your empire
1	look at me , son
1	he saw nothing of all this : people who are overwhelmed with troubles never do look back
1	all of a sudden , he heard a racket behind him , the sound of running , cries of to arms !
1	the others could only see their immediate family , and that very rarely
1	but he did not abuse this knowledge in any way
1	now she ’ s a lady banker
1	it was clear that marius had his doubts about the origins of those six hundred thousand francs , that he feared some illicit source
1	he was timid to the point of seeming fierce , rarely went out , and saw no one but the poor who knocked on his window and his priest , the abbé mabeuf , who was a good old sort
1	in olden days a pianist used to punctuate segments of old burlesque movies ; now the reality of scenes of everyday life needs to be subtitled in similar vein , the audio-visual ailning to put paid to the silence of vision in its entirety
1	'he dead too , though , and all who remain silent
1	was he beginning to waver , in bewilderment , over a touch of adventure ?
1	as she swept the stairs , she stopped dead , forgetting her broom and the entire universe as she looked at this star shining at the bottom of her pocket
1	thénardier answered : she ’ s doing all right , i don ’ t know , leave me alone ; i said , get lost
1	when she had finished , she remained pensive
1	when mass was over , marius remained pensive as he moved along ; the old man came up again and said to him : i beg your pardon , monsieur , for having disturbed you a moment ago and for disturbing you again now , but you must have found me most annoying and so i must explain
1	marius , though , had to stay lying down on a chaise longue for over two months still , on account of the complications produced by the fractured collarbone
1	to hammer square formations , pulverize regiments , smash lines , grind and scatter massed formations—this was what it was all about for him , strike , strike , strike without letup , and he entrusted this task to the cannonball
1	while he wrote , the man talked out loud and marius heard what he said : to think there ’ s no equality , not even when you ’ re dead !
1	you receive him if you like , i don ’ t have much time for men of war in times of peace
1	what made the fault so enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed
1	father madeleine declined the cross
1	tholomyès was the original world-weary student
1	he had no court
1	there was not a soul in the woods or in the valley
1	from number to number , they had built number metres on average a year ; since then they have built eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries of masonry every year using small materials with a bath of hydraulic cement poured over a concrete base
1	they whispered to each other , marius leaning forward on his chaise longue , cosette standing close by him
1	he ’ s a little thing from bas-boulonnais
1	they stepped down from the throne with gravity , but without authority ; their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances that leave history with a sombre feeling ; it did not have either the spectral calm of charles i , number or napoléon ’ s eagle cry
1	he retraced his steps
1	bewigged tragedynumber has its raison d ’ être and far be it from me to challenge its right to exist , as some do in the name of aeschylusnumber there are rough drafts in nature ; there are , in creation , ready-made parodies
1	blind , marius had followed the course he would have followed with his eyes wide open
1	so he didn ’ t love his father—what of it ?
1	but it is up to society to save itself ; it is to its own goodwill that we appeal
1	get cracking , said fauchelevent
1	it was with great difficulty that the old monarchical provostship and , in the last ten years of the eighteenth century , the revolutionary mayoralty , managed to tunnel out the five leagues of sewers that existed before number all kinds of obstacles got in the way of this operation , some to do with the nature of the soil , others inherent in the very prejudices of the working population of paris
1	for napoléon , it was pure panicfnnumber blücher sees nothing in it but excitement ; wellington can ’ t make head or tail of it
1	the cellar rat , which smoked more than it shed light , made the inside of the elephant dimly visible
1	and that one fine day her nose will fall into her mouthnumber
1	these stockings , still gracefully moulded to the shape of little legs , were scarcely any longer than jean valjean ’ s hand
1	the french revolution is a move made by god
1	it had happened , it was all over ; he saw all the monstrous aspects of his past come to life again , reappearing all around him , with all the frightening force of reality
1	the guide had replied in the negative
1	this had its drawbacks
1	beneath the gilding of the heavens i glimpse a destitute universe
1	this one was an officer
1	it is precisely a matter of reproducing these gestures and songs as they were , made or sung by men who are the same but also not who they were – that being the point
1	jean valjean was not dead
1	she answered him sobbing these words straight from paradise that are never more thrilling than when said through tears : i adore you !
1	she no longer had a bed , all she had left was a rag she called her bedspread , a mattress on the floor , and a chair with the cane seat missing
1	this particular rag-and-bone woman was a grateful old sack and she smiled—what a smile ! —to the three porter women
1	the down on a peach , the frost on a plum , the radiate crystal of a snowflake , a butterfly ’ s wing powdered with feathers , are coarse things beside this chastity that does not even know it is chaste
1	i have to be there tonight
1	i won ’ t see her again
1	jean valjean did not utter a word
1	cosette laid her head on the good man ’ s shoulder and did not say a word
1	this man , who looked so much the man and yet cried like a woman , had struck the churchwarden
1	the candle was burned virtually to the bottom
1	there was once a greek painter named euphorion who was known as the painter of lips
1	madame campan quotes what a little girl of seven had to say to a big girl of sixteen , who took the head of the procession while she , the little girl , remained at the back : you may be a virgin , but i ’ m not
1	don ’ t expect me until the day after tomorrow
1	same age—he ’ s fifty-four , same height , same look , same man , in a word , it ’ s him
1	javert replied in his most imperious tone : why not right away ?
1	i don ’ t know how to explain ; me , i didn ’ t have any schooling , i ’ m a poor man
1	he even contributed to their misfortune , and he exacerbated it
1	at a given moment , any barricade that holds out inevitably becomes a raft of the medusa
1	the only thing that could clearly be discerned in his demeanor and on his countenance was a strange indecisiveness
1	cosette would outdo him
1	it was closed down soon after number montparnasse cemetery , number known as the east cemetery , has taken over from it , inheriting the famous watering hole bordering the vaugirard cemetery that used to have a wooden signboard over it with a quince painted on it ; it had an l-shaped bar , with the tables of drinkers on one side and the graves on the other , and this sign : au bon coing—at the good quince
1	the door of the dining room , which , as we have seen , opened straight onto the square in front of the cathedral , was once as loaded with locks and bolts as the door of a prison
1	i am about to go into that dark night without even seeing her again
1	but you ’ d hold it against me , maybe , when we see each other again in a little while
1	but , when all ’ s said and done , what was true in the tales told about the first phase of monsieur myriel ’ s life ?
1	from that moment on , his name was known
1	he walked with firm tread to the wall , pushed marius and the doctor aside when they tried to help him , took down the small copper crucifix from the wall where it was hanging , came back and sat down with all the ease of movement of a man in his prime , and said in a loud voice , laying the crucifix on the table : there is the great martyr
1	the first to reach the garden gate stopped and waited for the others ; a second later , all six were gathered together
1	as soon as the chief orders everyone to man their stations , all chaotic movement ceases ; no more skirmishing with one another ; no more nattering huddles ; no more private conversations ; no more standing aloof ; whatever is in everyone ’ s minds converges and turns into waiting for the assailant
1	in which you will read a delightful saying of the king ’ s
1	in toulon he was dressed in a red smock known as a paletot
1	the name thénardier , which monsieur leblanc did not seem to know , was known to marius
1	oh , the bastard ’ s cunning as a sewer rat
1	but you could not see anything of the outside
1	the real sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand five hundred francs
1	i ’ ve found the solution
1	javert felt his mind was about to snap
1	ah , you used to talk to me more friendly !
1	there aren ’ t any stars in the sky
1	people barricaded themselves in their houses ; wives and mothers fretted ; all you heard was : oh , my god !
1	jean valjean had arranged himself to stay alive in there and he was more or less still breathing
1	this hankie belonged to the old monsieur , who had quite simply dropped it out of his pocket
1	a room where you bed down costs twenty sous ; a room where you get some rest costs twenty francs
1	one evening in this same month of april , jean valjean had gone out and cosette had sat down on this bench after sunset
1	day was dawning when those inhabitants of montfermeil who were starting to open their doors saw walking by on the road to paris a shabbily dressed man hand in hand with a little girl all in mourning and carrying a big pink doll in her arms
1	what was the second man ’ s objective ?
1	the innkeeper felt a shiver of joy
1	he went into a spin , furious
1	it ’ s an old cemetery that ’ s in breach of the regulations , it doesn ’ t have the uniform and it ’ s going to take retirement
1	monsieur gillenormand , who was as alive as it was possible to be in number , was one of those men who have become a curiosity solely because they have lived a long while , and who are odd because once upon a time they looked like everyone else and now they don ’ t look like anyone
1	cosette did not complain , she did not say a thing , she did not ask any questions , she did not seek any reason why ; she had already reached the stage where you fear being found out or giving yourself away
1	he was a huge lazy force
1	this convent will be our salvation , he murmured
1	she had a way of coming out with quite grown-up little notions in her sweet infantile voice
1	meanwhile , you do what you can to alleviate the defect ; you can even identify where the holes and hollows in the bore of a gun tube are by using calipers
1	explaining actually means two quite different things
1	it was the man ’ s hat
1	the cops are onto us , to boot , and there ’ s a gunner on the lookout
1	he took his head in his two hands but it was no good , he could not manage to explain it to himself
1	a bale of straw
1	with the human race rising upward , the lowest levels will emerge quite naturally from the zone of distress
1	not being able to say she was married , she was very careful , as we have already hinted , not to mention her little girl
1	i the lark ’ s field
1	i don ’ t believe i have the right to kill a man ; but i feel i have a duty to exterminate evil
1	this is how , in the blindness of a bad political economy , we drown and let the well-being of all stream away and disappear in swallow holes
1	the shock of his fall had jolted the footropes and set them rocking like a swing
1	the man looked all around him , saw no one , dared not peer into that black corner , and stepped up the pace , frightened out of his wits
1	the judge repeated the question
1	at the same time our parents are appealing to us
1	who can this champmathieu be ?
1	the blessed mezzocane , abbé of aquila , wanted to be buried beneath the gallows ; that was done
1	love , you hold the future in your hands
1	the man was tall , dressed in a long redingote , and he had a cudgel under his arm
1	are you calling louis-philippe a tyrant ?
1	twenty times , when he was in that carriage face-to-face with jean valjean , the legal tiger in him had roared
1	but it ’ ll still take a good quarter of an hour
1	he knew her eyes , her forehead , her beauty , her figure , her gait , but he did not know the sound of her voice
1	the ridge of the hump that determines which way the water flows follows an extremely capricious line
1	nature in the month of april is full of that glorious light that travels from the sky , the clouds , the trees , the meadows , and the flowers right into the heart of humankind
1	this small pellet falls into the courtyard
1	let ’ s not get carried away
1	scaling a wall and theft , it ’ s all there
1	this passerby did well to hurry , for very shortly afterwards , six men entered the rue plumet , creeping along the walls , separately and at some distance from each other , looking for all the world like a drunken patrol
1	every good girl contains a hero
1	the fact is that it got no higher on average than six or seven feet
1	the true division of humanity is this : those filled with light and those filled with darkness
1	if his wish had been granted , if he had at that moment seen cosette ogling a lancer , he would have died of pain without being able to utter a word
1	in the face of such absolute assertion , mother jondrette lifted her big ruddy blond head and looked up at the ceiling with a twisted expression
1	the night probably knew more about him than the day
1	monsieur gillenormand would have liked marius to throw himself into his arms
1	there had already been more than one chapter in their barely begun romantic novel , and the amorous young man who was called adolphe in the first chapter turned into alphonse in the second and gustave in the third
1	he was going to get himself killed
1	that was the question
1	if such a feeling still exists in you , and i hope it does , reflect before you answer me , consider , on the one hand , this man whom a word from you may destroy , and on the other hand , justice , which a word from you may clarify
1	times are certainly hard !
1	it was not serious and he would not allow anyone to look at it , or bandage it , or even to see that he was in pain , not even cosette
1	in the absence of inspector javert , i believe i should remind the gentlemen of the jury what he said in this very place a few hours ago
1	enjolras resumed : the position ’ s good , the barricade is beautiful
1	but what they were attacking was the younger branch of divine right in louis-philippe , just as they had attacked the elder branch in charles x ; and what they wanted to overthrow in overthrowing royalty in france , as we explained , was the usurpation of man over man and of privilege over justice throughout the world
1	there is , in this way of living , some good mingled with the bad , for if enfeeblement is harmful , generosity is healthful and good
1	homer would have tied up polyphemus with it , shakespeare , calibannumber
1	montparnasse gave him a wink
1	normally this flame that burns us also enlightens us a little , shedding a little helpful light around us
1	we saw him hotfooting it out of town
1	what is this place ?
1	it looks like we ’ ve got a common interest
1	but the historian must also take what was written in the language of words and with the tools of rhetoric and re-read it , delving beneath what the words say and dredging up what they say without thinking , what they say as monuments , as opposed to what they say intentionally
1	was made with a faith so profound , with so much certainty , with such a total lack of anxiety and doubt , that he could find no words
1	in this way , they reckon , it can have peace after its revolution , that is , time to bandage its wounds and get its house in order
1	he thought he ’ d been too kind , too soft , we might as well say it , too weak
1	then he stuck the shovel in the ground and added : you see , it ’ s going to be a cold night tonight and the dead woman ’ s going to give us a piece of her mind if we plant her here without a cover
1	i answered : we did have ; among others monsieur de lucenet , who was captain of the old city gates at pontarlier under the ancien régime
1	in the days when he still went out , he had bought a little copper crucifix for a few sous from a coppersmith and he had hung it on a nail facing his bed
1	one of the survivors of the expedition , a smart sewer worker , very young at the time , was still a few years ago telling anyone who ’ d listen the curious details that bruneseau thought it best to leave out of his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of the administrative style
1	i ’ m in love with the character over the road from my place
1	as for éponine , javert saw to it that she was nabbed again
1	he said abruptly : what have you come here for ?
1	revolutionary fever was gaining , in any case
1	it got to the point at a certain moment , while my brother was talking about the mountain folk of pontarlier who have sweet work close to the heavens and who , he added , are happy because they are innocent , where he stopped short , fearing that in that word that had escaped his lips there was something that could rub the man the wrong way
1	i took the bowl of the clay pipe ,
1	marius , feverish , his stomach empty , his every hope shed , one after the other , stranded in grief , the darkest of shipwrecks , awash with violent emotions , and feeling the end near , had sunk deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor that always preludes the fatal hour when it is willed and welcomed
1	that which sits up there , at the top , at the summit , at the zenith , that which pours so much light over the earth , might actually see little , see badly , see not at all ?
1	nearly all the stagecoaches heading for the south and the west took the champs-élysées in those days
1	trying to outdo mere representation by offering the very presence oj the event , as instantaneous photography vvould do , followed by the photo- finish and the first cinematographic newsreels of the lumiere brothers and , ultimately , the live coverage offered by cnn
1	fantine , who had not taken her eyes off javert , wheeled around : did i say anything to you ?
1	gavroche ’ s adventure , which remained in the traditions of the temple quartier , is one of the most terrible memories of the old bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their reminiscences : night attack on the post of the imprimerie royale
1	at times , he probably actually laughed to himself and talked out loud
1	bahorel shouted : flock—that ’ s a polite way of saying sheep
1	it does seem , indeed , that certain people are endowed with a real animal instinct , pure and intact like all instincts , that creates antipathies and affinities , that fatally divides one personality from another , that does not hesitate , that is never in doubt , is never silenced and never flags , clear in its obscurity , infallible , imperious , resistant to all the counsels of intelligence and all the solvents of reason and that , whatever their fates may be , secretly alerts the dog-man to the presence of the cat-man , and the fox-man to the presence of the lion-man
1	madame magloire , said the bishop , set one more place
1	thénardier was a different man now
1	the door was the one in the visitors ’ room reserved for the gardener in the course of his duties
1	at times her unbuttoned and torn chemise nearly fell down to her waist
1	all eyes followed him
1	he had to tackle holly , nettles , hawthorn , dog roses , thistles , the meanest of brambles , and got himself scratched to bits
1	citizens , said enjolras , what that man did is horrifying and what i did is horrible
1	fantine asked him : what did the doctor say ?
1	napoléon was used to staring hard at war ; he never did the poignant sums of details , figure by figure ; figures mattered little to him , as long as they amounted to this total : victory
1	the porter did not seem to understand either javert ’ s words or jean valjean ’ s signs
1	a sewer is a misunderstanding
1	madame victurnien sometimes saw her going by her window , noticed the distress of that creature , put in her place thanks to her , and was very pleased with herself
1	the historian of customs and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events
1	real misery , he had just seen
1	grantaire had risen to his feet
1	the next day jean valjean threw marius the glance marius finally caught
1	jean valjean looked as though he were about to pass out
1	two were bolder still
1	that is indeed the question at the dawn of the millennium
1	that doesn ’ t stop him from defending it , retorted enjolras
1	one of these flags was red and blue with an imperceptible white stripenumber in between
1	a hundred and nine francs fifteen sous
1	otherwise , the days went by , one after the other , and nothing new cropped up
1	in the cloister , games were heavenly
1	he managed to vanish , sold the bishop ’ s silver , keeping only the candlesticks as mementos , crept from town to town , travelled across france , turned up in montreuil-sur-mer , had the bright idea we ’ ve mentioned above , achieved what we ’ ve outlined , managed to make himself unassailable and inaccessible and from then on , well established in montreuil-sur-mer , happy to feel his conscience burdened by his past and the first half of his existence belied by this new phase , he lived a quiet life , reassured and hopeful , having only two concerns : to hide his name and to sanctify his life ; to escape the clutches of men and to return to god
1	the woman had murdered her child , infanticide was proved , the jury ruled out premeditation , she was sentenced to life
1	i can ’ t remember which philosopher it was who said : there is never any shortage of old women
1	i ’ ll stop this miserable bastard when i ’ m good and ready , he thought
1	my child , that is quite a load you ’ re carrying there , for you
1	over that way , you don ’ t pick the grapes ripe
1	number , he came to a tavern with this sign hanging on the outside : aux quatre vents
1	he seemed to stop looking or thinking
1	he was forced to make a mental effort to remember that all that surrounded him was real
1	the tiny one had his eyes open , but he didn ’ t say a word
1	cosette hung her head and went to get an empty bucket sitting in the corner of the fireplace
1	the riot had wreathed everything in its smoke
1	these words of francis bacon 's , taken from david sylvester 's interviews with the artist and quoted as a lead-in for the amodern starts ' exhibition at the museum of modern art in new york , , beautifully sum up the current dilemma : the less you represent , the more you push the simulacrum of representation !
1	she keeps the inn
1	he rushed to the window that looked on the street , opened it with his shaky old hands , leaned out down to the waist while basque and nicolette held him from behind , and cried : marius !
1	in nearly all the songs from the galleys , penal colonies , and penitentiaries of the eighteenth century , you find a diabolical and puzzling gaiety
1	from now on i can do nothing more for her
1	i want you to keep your job
1	all that seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind a theatre curtain
1	a quartet of crooks , claquesous , gueulemer , babet , and montparnasse , ruled the dregs of paris from number to number
1	i must have forgotten it
1	no doubt the poetic voice off that accompanies the images voices the suffering of the earth and of a life that aspires to resume the course of its thoughts ’
1	this will do for my dinner today , he thought
1	the shot went off , the bullet passed through his hand and perhaps through the workman , too , for he fell , but the bullet did not reach marius
1	everyone has noticed how swiftly a coin you drop on the ground rolls away and hides and how cleverly it makes itself unfindable
1	these epochs are singular and manage to baffle politicians who hope to exploit them
1	… well , then , monsieur , my worthy monsieur , do you know what is going to happen tomorrow ?
1	i won ’ t ask you any more questions
1	jondrette does his shopping
1	it seems that around these great centres of the movement of people , at the rolling of these powerful machines , at the breathing of these monstrous horses of civilization that eat coal and vomit fire , the seed-filled earth trembles and opens in order to swallow up the former dwellings of men and let the new ones out
1	so , who gives two hoots ?
1	it rolls there in wide and terrible corrugations ; it gathers and builds ; the torrent charges at the piles of the bridges as though to rip them out with fat liquid ropes
1	the old legitimist parties nonetheless assailed the revolution of number with all the violence that comes from false reasoning
1	the sun was going down and appetite was fading
1	marius was truly astounded
1	then he found himself back in his room , and he put his candle down on a table
1	i always thought there was something bad at the bottom of all that
1	when at two o ’ clock the royal carriage , surrounded by a squadron of silver-trimmed guards of the royal corps , came into the boulevard after skirting around la salpêtrière hospital , he appeared startled and almost alarmed
1	where there was once the battered old rattletrap there is now the railway car ; where there was once the rickety old two-masted cutter , there is now the steamboat ; today we say fécamp the way we once said saint-cloudnumber the paris of number is a city that has the whole of france as its suburbs
1	gavroche ’ s bed sat under the mesh as in a cage
1	no one ever knew how he managed to get into the courtyard without going through the carriage entrance
1	thanks to the traveller ’ s fifty-seven francs , thénardier was able to avoid a cautionnumber and to honour his signature
1	you ’ ll see if there won ’ t be miracles galore here , father fauvent !
1	it was almost night
1	the jondrette girl ’ s eyes had gone from forlorn to joyful and from joyful to grim
1	cosette did not know what love was
1	this is a stroke of luck , said courfeyrac
1	can you be too happy ?
1	he was in hungary , in , in a tank
1	babet was skinny and smart
1	the first thing cosette felt was a confused and deep sadness
1	you don ’ t really imagine that people die just like that ?
1	for marius , listening to cosette talk fashion ;
1	thénardier resumed : let ’ s get it over with , then
1	my brother is so good
1	are you headed for arras ?
1	they did not doubt their success any more than they doubted their cause
1	too much zeal is the death of peach trees and apricots
1	i absolutely have to marry her , i ’ d go mad otherwise
1	then there was the bundle of clothes already put together in advance for the little girl , that was very strange—there had to be any amount of mystery behind that
1	we are unlearning certain things and that is all to the good , as long as in unlearning this , you learn that
1	this whole prodigious city is a condensation of dead customs and creeds and living customs and creeds
1	the carter was so moved by the five-franc coin that he left his glass where it was and came running over
1	but its director , humphrey jennings , had a singular take on his work of propaganda for a country resisting the enemy 's bombs
1	at this point , cosette sobbed even harder
1	doctor , he ’ s coming back !
1	montparnasse went on : i ’ m goin ’ to find babet
1	what can you say , meanwhile , about the likes of richard hiilsen- beck , one of the founding fathers of dada , who told a berlin audience in , at a conference on the new trends in art , 'vve were for the war
1	the riots brought the cloudy skies back , they made that revolution , initially so remarkable for its unanimity , degenerate into a brawl
1	thénardier registered the movement and went on at the slow pace of an orator who holds his audience in the palm of his hand and feels his enemy squirming under his words : this man was forced to go into hiding , though for reasons that have nothing to do with politics , and he ’ d taken the sewer as his place of residence and had a key to it
1	by another natural consequence , the closer he came to his father , to his memory , and to the things for which the colonel had fought for twenty-five years , the further away he moved from his grandfather
1	the moment you hear the cab stop , open up straightaway , he ’ ll come up , you ’ ll light the stairs and the hall , and when he comes in here , go straight back down again and pay the driver and send the cab on its way
1	he said of the school portal : what a fine old man !
1	unbeknown to him , the mayor of montreuil-sur-mer enjoyed a kind of celebrity
1	volume by volume , the whole library went south
1	try and take away the dog the lion has in its cage !
1	come on , what is it ?
1	too much misery , as we have noted , had turned him into something of a visionary
1	universal suffrage has a wonderful way of dissolving the riot ’ s raison d ’ être , and by giving insurrection the vote , it takes away its weapons
1	cosette was huddled against him , trembling
1	if you don ’ t buy my painting , dear benefactor , jondrette wailed , i ’ ll be without resources , there ’ ll be nothing left for me to do but throw myself in the river
1	it happened very smoothly
1	philosophy has to be an energy , with the aim and effect of improving man
1	so , what about the surprise ?
1	you ’ ll be crawling on your stomach through the scrub and you ’ ll eat grass like the brutes of the woods
1	louis xi is there with tristan , françois i is there with duprat , charles ix is there with his mother , richelieu is there with louis xiii , louvoisnumber is there , letellier is there , hébert and maillardnumber are there , scraping stones and trying to make all traces of their actions disappear
1	tentative attempts at escape
1	there has been no despot , no traitor , for what will shortly be a century , who has not initialled , ratified , signed and countersigned , ne varietur , number the partition of poland
1	monsieur madeleine turned toward the jurors and toward the court and said in a soft voice : gentlemen of the jury , let the accused go
1	from time to time , he shook his head as though answering some question he had silently put to himself
1	the emperor , pleased , shouted to him : you are a colonel , you are a baron , you are an officer of the légion d ’ honneur !
1	but while he was waiting , the cab might take off
1	the monarchy pranced around in its flounces
1	when the tale was told , everyone there was in raptures over the cunning of the prosecuting magistrate
1	he was the one who saved my life !
1	it is to attain the greatness of aeschylusnumber
1	the walls were white , the tables were black ; these two colours of mourning are the only choices convents have
1	we couldn ’ t care less
1	meanwhile the fiacre rolled along
1	jean valjean was still in the same place , motionless on his curbstone
1	i end up with great heaps in me room
1	with what despairing ravishment he contemplated that convent garden , full of flowers blooming unseen and incarcerated virgins , where all the perfumes and all the souls wafted straight up to heaven !
1	he told himself that he was happy that it was not there , that it had disappeared , that this was good , that this was only right , that his grandfather had been the true keeper of his father ’ s flame and that it was better that the colonel ’ s sword had been sold to the highest bidder , sold to a junk dealer , tossed among old scrap iron , rather than to cause the flank of his homeland to bleed today
1	my name is pontmercy
1	to arrest him too soon would be to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs
1	noble and mysterious triumphs that no other eyes see , that no renown rewards , that no fanfare salutes
1	the sister tried to speak , but she could barely stutter a few inarticulate sounds
1	who , in any case , could have guessed such a thing ?
1	he examined , dispassionately and with the eye of a linguist deciphering a palimpsest , the level of chaos that exists even in nature
1	it was tempting and courfeyrac could not resist
1	they own only one in thirty of the goats they look after
1	the man talking to him was an old man , stooped and lame , decked out more or less like a peasant and wearing a leather knee pad on his left knee with a fairly big bell hanging from it
1	one day i saw some senators passing along the quai malaquais in mantles of violet velvet strewn with bees and wearing hats like henri ivnumber they were hideous
1	they ’ re out of harm ’ s way
1	his entrance was triumphant
1	june number , number , approximately one o ’ clock in the morning
1	you would have described this gaze as not so much penetrating as boring right through you
1	you need a change of soil , greenhouse and potnumber
1	v the rose realizes she is an engine of war
1	roses are red , violets are blue ,
1	and the fate of cinema , and of its relationship to the common fate of history , could stand between two ideas of music : the well-orchestrated symphony of images that , for canudo , epstein or vertov , was meant to take the place of the old language of words , and the distant call of words to images that currently characterizes its most acute forms
1	it ’ s a poor little thing that we took in just like that , out of charity
1	but the man , after leaving his bundle and his stick on a seat , had sat down at a table , where cosette rushed to put a bottle of wine and a glass
1	things come rushing back with abrupt lucidity , the annihilation caused by drunkenness , a sort of condensation steaming up over the brain and blinding it , evaporates and gives way to a clear and clean grasp of reality
1	his dream was to come by some windfall of an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand francs in income in order to have mistresses
1	she has a son , theft , and a daughter , hunger
1	the aide-de-camp , bernard , delivered the emperor ’ s order to them
1	i ’ m the innkeeper of montfermeil !
1	and so , eight or ten months after what was narrated in the previous pages , around about the first days of january number , on a night of snow , one of these dandies , one of these idlers—obviously a true conformist , for he wore a morillo , and was snugly wrapped up in one of those huge greatcoats that then completed the cold-weather fashion plate—was getting his kicks harassing a creature on the prowl in front of the window of the officers ’ café in a very low-cut ball gown and with flowers wreathed around her head
1	i was one of the masters of the state , the vaults of the treasury were piled so high with coins that we were forced to prop up the walls which were ready to burst under the weight of all that gold and silver ; i dined in the rue de l ’ arbre-sec at twenty-two sous a head
1	the moment is a solemn one and there is still time for you to retract , if you think you have made a mistake
1	whoever you are , you who go by the name of prejudice , abuse , ignominy , oppression , iniquity , despotism , injustice , fanaticism , tyranny , watch out for the wide-eyed gamin
1	… arrive every year from savoy ,
1	the elbow made by the houses hid them from the insurgents
1	cosette guided the stranger through the streets
1	yes , said the woman
1	to the eye of the dreamer , all the historic murderers are there , in the hideous gloom , on their knees , with a fold of their shrouds as apron , dourly mopping up their work
1	suppose i do let her go and sacrifice myself , i ’ d like to know where she ’ s going , i wouldn ’ t want to lose sight of her , i ’ d want to know who she ’ s living with , so i could go and see her now and then , and for her to know that her good old foster father is there , that he ’ s watching over her
1	the glasses of the whole staff studied the cloud signalled by the emperor
1	how to argue and use vous just to use tu with all the more relish afterwards ;
1	he had no money but , whenever the fancy took him , he always found the means to damn the expense
1	combeferre , who spoke thus , was not an orphan
1	and she began to laugh
1	he would camp for a while at one person ’ s place , then at someone else ’ s , most often at joly ’ s
1	oh , cosette is a pretty awful name they must have pulled out of a hat when i was little
1	this is part of a story
1	i ’ m not some nonentity without a name who slinks into other people ’ s houses and kidnaps children !
1	at the same time , he rented two other apartments in paris , so that he would attract less attention than if he always stayed in the same quartier , so that he could absent himself , if need be , at the slightest concern he might have , and finally , so that he would not find himself caught short again like the night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert
1	he signalled to his wife , who came running , and after he showed her the line written on the piece of paper , he added in a muffled voice : quick , the ladder !
1	boulatruelle had explored , probed , and poked around the whole forest and rooted around wherever the ground looked freshly disturbed to him
1	only , above the president ’ s head there was a crucifix , something that was missing from the courtrooms at the time he was convictednumber when he was tried , god had not been there
1	the devil ceases to be le rabouin and becomes le boulanger , the baker , he who puts into the oven
1	all political opinions were indifferent to him and he approved of all of them without distinguishing between them , so that they would leave him in peace , much the way the greeks called the furies the beautiful , the good , the charming , the eumenides ! number monsieur mabeuf ’ s own political stance was to love plants with a passion , and books more than anything in the world
1	the hole that the demolished house left in the street is half-filled by a rotten paling fence , propped up by five stone posts
1	all she understood was that she was leaving the thénardier flophouse behind
1	it ’ s all part of my gardening
1	what we lack attracts us
1	and , rotten as she was , she lived the way the rotten live ,
1	these salons had their very own literature and politics
1	this good man here will carry you on his back in that
1	and in a second goes from a waif to a giant
1	but she only stayed six or eight months , giving as the reason for leaving that the garden had no shade
1	; accustomed by his past life to culpable actions and barely checked by his time in jail , as the crime committed against petit-gervais proves , etc , etc
1	one sunday when he had gone to hear mass at saint-sulpice , in the same chapel of the virgin that his aunt used to take him to when he was little , being even more absentminded and dreamy than usual that day , he took a seat behind a pillar and knelt , without paying it any attention , on a utrecht velvet chair on the back of which was written the name m mabeuf , churchwarden
1	most of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared ; they kept their mouths shut from the very next day ; but of what we are about to relate , we can say : we saw it with our own eyes
1	he had written him the letter we know about , without knowing him
1	passersby would study him with surprise and a few found he had a suspicious demeanour and a sinister face
1	jondrette opened a cupboard next to the fireplace and pulled out an old cap , which he slapped on his head after whacking it on his sleeve to dust it
1	this very precise statement appeared to produce a rousing impression on the public and the jury
1	you could have invited good old once upon a time to it
1	the next day , he did not come
1	a fourteen-year-old boy was stopped in the rue de la cossonnerie with his pockets full of cartridges
1	what glory in god for the community !
1	the good women of the quartier would say : that man ’ s an innocent
1	now defend me against my husband
1	cosette was saying to marius : you know what ?
1	an apostle may be reckless , but a bishop has to tread carefully
1	jean-baptiste greuze , the painter who could make an example of any domestic scene , making people 's bodies and gazes stretch out towards the dying father , the prodigal son or the well-behaved wife , no longer had any idea how to give caracalla the grandeur that a roman emperor , no matter how villainous he may have been , should manifest in his attitude
1	the air ’ ll do her good , said jondrette
1	as he was leaving , he said to the sister : she ’ s better
1	for too long , the argument goes , has art been an ornament and a diversion ; the time has come for the artist to accept adult responsibilities and to make art a weapon
1	i beseech you , in heaven ’ s name , i join my hands together in prayer , monsieur , i throw myself at your feet , allow me to marry her
1	the reader has no doubt guessed that thénardier ’ s tracker was none other than javert
1	he seemed to be listening
1	this being so , as a convent turned up on our path , we simply had to go in
1	these in pace , these solitary cells , these iron hinges , these collar shackles , this high skylight on a level with the flowing river , this stone box sealed with a granite lid like a tomb , with this difference that here death was living , this floor that is mud , this shit-hole , these oozing walls—how they rant !
1	a person owes six hundred thousand francs some consideration and it was obvious that she could not do otherwise than to leave her fortune to these young people , since they no longer needed it
1	one of the scenes that gave rise to the drama we are relating is connected to this battle , but this history is not our subject ; this history , moreover , has been told and told in masterly fashion , both from napoléon ’ s point of view and from the opposite point of viewnumber by a glittering array of historians
1	a memory suddenly sprang to mind
1	paphosnumber had turned itself back into eden
1	i await your presance or your offering , if you daine make one , and i beg you to accept the respeckful feelings with which i honnour myself to be ,
1	and it all came about without my doing a thing !
1	monsieur le maire , the cabriolet is here
1	i don ’ t know anything about marius ’ s itinerary
1	in small towns , a woman down on her luck is naked before the sarcastic remarks and curiosity of all and sundry
1	from that moment on , though , he didn ’ t come across another thing
1	jean valjean gets his revenge
1	the human body undergoes something of this quivering as the moment arrives when the mysterious fingers of death are about to gather the soul
1	he had to make a huge effort to recall what on earth he ’ d been thinking before midnight sounded
1	a good number of old friends of the gillenormand family had been invited and they buzzed around cosette , vying with each other to call her madame la baronne
1	javert took the blow standing , full on and bang in the chest like a russian soldier
1	since jean valjean was alone , and there was no one there ?
1	and this is the great skill of alchemy : to make a success look like a catastrophe so that those who benefit from it also quake in their boots over it , to season any step forward with fear , to increase the transition curve so much that progress is slowed , to make the dawn dull , to denounce and discount the bitter struggles of enthusiasm , to cut corners and fingernails , to dampen triumph , to muffle right , to wrap that giant , the people , in flannel and put them swiftly to bed , to impose a diet on such excessively good health , to put hercules on a convalescent ’ s regime , to water down the event with the expedient , to offer minds thirsty for the ideal this nectar diluted with herbal tea , to take all precautions against too much success , to stick a lampshade over the revolution
1	all of a sudden he heard a noise behind him ; it was the porter woman , patagon , who had followed him and who , from a distance , was showing him her fist and shouting : you are nothing but a bastard !
1	'the cinema means putting your eyes into uniform ' , kafka confirmed
1	why must the time come when you emerge from blue skies and why does life go on afterwards ?
1	at this abrupt question , the man flinched
1	mother thénardier flung the door to the street wide open
1	myself , i side with the great clock of strasbourg , and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock of the black forest any day
1	he said mass in the middle of the jail , at an altar ; he had a pointed thing , gold , on his headnumber in the heat of the day , it shone like blazes
1	what a cursed fate !
1	but the two orders remained no less distinct
1	what about the silver ?
1	if we didn ’ t love one another , i really can ’ t see the good in having a spring ; and , as for myself , i ’ d ask the good lord to pack up all the beautiful things he lays out before us and take them back and stick the flowers and the birds and the pretty girls back in his box
1	a shiver ran through his body
1	one after the other , pontmercy saw wurmser taken prisoner in mantua , mélas in alexandria , mack in ulmnumber he was part of the eighth corps of the grande armée that mortier commanded and that captured hamburg
1	javert respectfully saluted the mayor , who turned his back on him and , without taking any notice of him , went on making notes in his file
1	lafayette took on the coronation
1	on all fronts , he had something to worry about
1	all around this deserted and ominous labyrinth , in the quartiers where the paris traffic had not been brought to a standstill and where a few rare lamplights still shone , the aerial observer would have been able to make out the metallic scintillation of sabres and bayonets , the muffled rumbling of artillery , and the swarming of silent battalions swelling in number from one minute to the next ; a daunting belt that slowly tightened and closed around the riot
1	he was forced to admit to his dismay that what looked like a door was simply a wooden panel cladding a structure it backed onto
1	that such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is surely unexpected
1	i reckoned it was going to rain and that there was no good lord to stop it from raining , so i came back to town to try and find a doorway
1	oh , yes , that ’ s true , you ’ ll tell all this to cosette
1	when he had got to the rue pavée , the rag-and-bone woman came back into his mind and he uttered this soliloquy : you are wrong to insult revolutionaries , mother gutter-sweep
1	ah , he really is gorgeous
1	the old man continued with a tiny smile : in that case , you are my bishop ?
1	another time she looked him steadily in the eye and declared : monsieur , you ’ re handsome , you ’ re gorgeous , you ’ re clever as can be and you ’ re not at all stupid , you ’ re a lot more knowledgeable than i am , but take this : i love you !
1	on certain days , every one of these beings took a turn putting in twelve hours at a stretch kneeling on the flagstones or prostrate face down on the ground , arms out on both sides like a cross
1	as she went on , her tone expressed the joy of being able to boast about something no human being is immune to : i can read , you know !
1	such are the effects of dawn , of childhood , of youth , of joy
1	she was always a bit on the wide-eyed side
1	the tilbury ’ s wheel took quite a shock
1	he had scattered his bouquet over it
1	she ’ s a greuzenumber so , you ’ re going to have this all to yourself , then , you cheeky rascal !
1	and this situation was , as we said at the beginning , made more palpable and urgent by the faubourg saint-antoine than by any other part of the population
1	on one side , endless shadow ; on the other , an atom
1	only , the wounded man did not stir , and jean valjean had no idea whether the man he was carrying into this pit was alive or dead
1	do not condemn this man , at least !
1	did they eat into the skull ?
1	there are traitors employed in lots of prisons , half jailors , half thieves , who help in breakouts , who sell their disloyal services to the police and make a fair bit on the side out of the rotten eggs thrown in the police wagon
1	every day some detail went , changing the overall picture
1	your little girl is here
1	vvhich is only in keeping with what was already being produced by the german expression- ism denounced by rene gimpel
1	in the frightened reverie into which your soul is thrown by its presence , the scaffold appears terrifying and somehow actively involved in what it does
1	they were usually frayed , which meant he buttoned his coat right up to his chin
1	these four words , gouged out in the stone with a nail , could still be read on the wall in number
1	he went and sat close to the fireplace and stretched his aching feet out in front of the fire
1	at saint-pol he unharnessed the horse at the first inn he came to and had the horse taken to the stable
1	father fauvent , we must do what the dead want us to do
1	grantaire retorted in a grave voice : you ’ ll see
1	every time the poor miserable wretch has a moment to think , he makes himself small before the law and puny before society ; he lies down flat on his stomach and he grovels , he implores pity ; you feel that he knows he ’ s in the wrong
1	style is the shape the ideal takes , rhythm , its movement
1	now and then , fighting off his weariness , he made an effort to think straight
1	you could hear javert ’ s voice thundering : search the cul-de-sac !
1	the young girls frolicked under the eyes of the nuns ; the gaze of flawlessness does not bother innocence
1	she had it hard , too
1	the snow was still falling , streaking the grey of the sky
1	she only ever read a prayer book in big letters and in latin
1	the shack was indeed so well hidden behind the ruin , and so unobtrusive in its design , that jean valjean had missed it
1	he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan
1	no , it can not , reverend mother
1	in the ruined wall , you can glimpse through windows garnished with iron bars the dismantled rooms of the main brick building
1	the judge , the counsel for the prosecution , monsieur bamatabois , twenty people recognized him and cried out in unison : monsieur madeleine !
1	yet , he thought to himself , she couldn ’ t help but hold me in high esteem if she knew it was i who am the real author of the dissertation on marcos obregon de la ronda , which monsieur françois de neufchâteau has claimed as his own and stuck at the beginning of his edition of gil blas ! number
1	history and representation : three poetics of modernity
1	cosette would laugh about it , calling the suitcase the inseparable , and saying , i ’ m jealous of it
1	this panchaud , alias printanier , alias bigrenaille , later featured in several criminal proceedings and has since become a celebrity crook
1	he rose and slowly crossed the room , head bowed , unsteady on his feet , more like a man about to die than one taking his leave
1	the cloaca has nothing left now of its primitive ferocity
1	his blood was pounding violently in his temples
1	the landless peasant woman who works by the day turns round when a stagecoach goes by , the landowning peasant woman labouring in her own field doesn ’ t turn round
1	low thick black mists crept up the hillsides and tore away from them like smoke
1	it suits me either to keep quiet or to give myself up , to hide myself or to save my soul , to be a magistrate , despicable but respected , or a galley slave , disgraced but noble , it ’ s all about me , me , me , me , nothing but me !
1	is this the place ?
1	am i to have first been the most miserable of men and then the most unhappy , am i to have done sixty years of life on my knees , am i to have suffered all a person can suffer , am i to have grown old without ever having been young , am i to have lived without a family , without parents , without friends , without a wife , without children , am i to have left my blood on every stone , on every blackberry bush , on every landmark , along every wall , am i to have been soft even though they were so hard on me , and good even though they were so bad to me , am i to have become an honest man again in spite of everything , am i to have repented of the wrong i ’ ve done and to have forgiven the wrong done to me , just so that , the moment i ’ m finally rewarded , the moment it ’ s all over , the moment i ’ ve reached the end , the moment i ’ ve got what i want—which is good , which is only right , i ’ ve paid for it , i ’ ve earned it—it all goes , it all evaporates into thin air , and i lose cosette , and i lose my life , my joy , my soul , because some donkey feels like coming and strutting around the luxembourg !
1	an eruption of young life flooded this garden that had a cross cut into it like a shroud
1	two men who can ’ t be found
1	he took the candle , the man took his bundle and his stick , and thénardier led him to a room on the first floor , which was of a rare splendour , all furnished in mahogany , with a sleigh bed and curtains of red calico
1	he was getting tired and as his strength diminished , the weight of his burden grew
1	one of the two guns now battering the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie was firing grapeshot and the other cannonballs
1	then she had sat down on the bench by the steps and while he took his place all atremble beside her , she had expanded : my father told me this morning to get ready , that he had business to attend to , and that we might perhaps be going away
1	the virtues of adversity
1	and then , she ’ ll be so nice , you ’ ll see !
1	that was no damp squib
1	a despairing certainty does not penetrate a man without pushing aside and sundering certain deep features that are sometimes the man himself
1	people have tried , wrongly , to make the bourgeoisie a class
1	as fast as it was , that look was the kind you recognize when you have seen it before ; it did not escape marius
1	he fully entered into a sense of reality ; he attained that state of calmness that allows you to listen
1	you can make out sheer precipices in them
1	this was an event , and the boarders of the day still talk about it
1	the lower she sank , the bleaker everything around her became , the more this sweet little angel shone in her heart of hearts
1	that expression , too , is suspect these days
1	dust , that end of all delight , was meant to chastise these poor little rosebuds of girls , guilty of chattering
1	so i told you straight out who i was
1	the obscure commercial bookshop had ended up providing him with secure work , work that didn ’ t involve much labour , and this , as we have just explained , was enough for him
1	the man went straight to the door to the street , opened it , and went out
1	their honour , thank god , their dignity , their radiance , their genius , are not numbers that those gamblers known as heroes and conquerors throw into the lottery of battle
1	the wagonload that headed the convoy struck up a tune , which they began belting out at the top of their lungs , with frantic joviality ; it was la vestale , one of désaugiers ’ snumber medleys , famous at the time ; the trees shivered forlornly ; in the side alleys , the faces of the bourgeois throng were covered in moronic bliss as they listened , riveted , to these bawdy ditties sung by spectres
1	chopped up , nettles are good for poultry ; ground , they ’ re good for horned animals
1	this shack , built out of rubble and still standing in number , consisted , as we have already said , of three rooms , all of which were completely bare
1	all the most august , the most sublime , the most delightful minds of humanity , and perhaps beyond humanity , have gone in for the play on words
1	in any case , both of them being unapproachable , there was no way marius could put a question of any kind to monsieur fauchelevent
1	maybe from the coast
1	was madame thénardier well out of the way ?
1	we shall see , said monsieur madeleine
1	he would kiss her on the forehead
1	but what do you want me to do about it ?
1	at wettingen , number under a shower of balls , he held in his arms colonel maupetit , mortally wounded at the head of the numberth dragoons
1	there was another pause
1	she swiftly broke the seal , opened it out and read ( for she could read ) :
1	over this , he would grow animated
1	if not the resurgence of a classicism that already laid claim to the eternal present of art , even going so far as to freeze it in geometric standards ( witness the golden l\ean ) bearing no relationship to the relative and ephemeral nature of analogical perception of events
1	it was gavroche going down the rue du chaume
1	if a detainee finds it , he hands the note over to the person it is intended for ; if it is a warden , or one of those prisoners who have secretly sold out , known as sheep in prisons and foxes in galleys , the note is taken to the clerk and delivered to the police
1	what is this secret ?
1	it was the start of the holidays and a bright hot summer ’ s day
1	me , i call a spade a spade
1	he was not looking at a spectacle ; he was enduring a vision
1	he told himself he had to do his duty ; that he might even be no more unhappy after having done his duty than after having eluded it ; that if he let well enough alone , if he remained in montreuil-sur-mer , his standing , his good reputation , his good works , the deference , the veneration , his charity , his wealth , his popularity , his virtue , would all be tainted by a crime ; and what a taste all those sacred things would leave , tainted by something so vile !
1	the basement of paris , if the eye could penetrate its surface , would reveal a colossal coral reef
1	and he breathed deeply with inexpressible relief
1	whenever jean valjean wanted to prolong his visit and make her forget the time , he would praise marius ; he would find him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good
1	not one living being passed in the streets , or walked in the rooms , or strolled about the gardens
1	she had thrown off her shawl but kept her hat on ; her husband , crouching behind her , almost vanished under the discarded shawl and she covered him with her body , holding the cobblestone with both hands above her head with the poise of a giant about to launch a rock
1	half the men on the muskets , the other half on the cobblestones
1	was that incredibly dense shadow that cloaked them about to be dispersed by light ?
1	and then , the more he recovered , the more his old grievances crept up on him , the more the old ulcers of his memory reopened , he thought once more about the past , colonel pontmercy once more came between monsieur gillenormand and himself , marius ; he told himself there was no real kindness to hope for from someone who had been so unjust and so hard on his father
1	this tiny change had in fact reduced the cost of the raw materials so considerably that it made it possible first , to raise wages , a benefit for the whole district ; second , to improve the manufacture , an advantage for the consumer ; and third , to sell them more cheaply while trebling the profits , a gain for the manufacturer
1	her blood was like ice in her veins
1	sleep comes a lot more easily than it comes back
1	for one thing , i don ’ t like balcony seats
1	montparnasse started to laugh
1	to suffer or to enjoy myself
1	with the candle out , he felt invisible
1	in any case , he made a virile and violent effort , overcame his hesitation , and continued his advance
1	asked the man of the house
1	in the world of slang
1	slang calls the coins known as écus les maltaises , or malteses , in a nod to the coinage that was current on the galleys of malta
1	hey , he said , you ’ ve still got your streetlamps over here
1	but before starting off , the driver shot a glance at the traveller ’ s mediocre getup , at the smallness of his bundle , and made sure he got the money up front
1	all of a sudden , on that whitish band , two silhouettes appeared
1	everything was still confused and in turmoil in his brain ; his brain was still so troubled that he could not latch on to any idea clearly and he himself would have been hard-pressed to describe what was happening to him except to say that he had just suffered quite a blow
1	i don ’ t need a pack of screaming brats , their mother would say
1	jean valjean had tacitly accepted cosette ’ s tacit acceptance
1	high walls hemmed him in on all sides
1	the man would most likely be found guilty ; the counsel for the prosecution—a wit who made up rhymes—was good
1	it would have been impossible to guess
1	and that is not a metaphor
1	for the passersby were now a crowd
1	you ’ re letting me do all the talking
1	the dandy was smoking , for smoking was very much in vogue
1	she would tell the sisters : i only feel alive when monsieur le maire is there
1	for example , the story entitled the last bolshevik , which ties all sorts of other images into the official image of the royal procession : images such as those from the rediscovered footage of alexander medvedkin 's films which , in various modes , accompanied the different phases of the soviet epic
1	the old man spoke with the volubility of a man of the land and there was nothing disturbing about it
1	spain buys a lot of it
1	you ought to keep those things up your beak all the time
1	the gendarmes headed off
1	the man replied : exactly
1	a few claimed he was a bit of a mystery man and asserted that no one had ever been into his room , which was a real anchorite ’ s cell , furnished with winged hourglasses and titivated with death ’ s-heads and crossbones
1	she studied herself from head to toe in the big mirror , then cried out in a burst of ineffable ecstasy : once upon a time there was a king and a queen
1	recommended by the eighty francs , they were handled with care , like all that is exploited for money ; not too badly turned out , not too badly fed , treated almost like little gentlemen , better off with the false mother than with the real one
1	he stopped in his tracks , shivering , distraught , and tipped back from the balls of his feet onto his heels
1	in any case , fantine was a fairly average worker
1	any crook who was bigger or smaller than the human average was ill at ease in the changer ’ s costumes
1	less than an hour later , the jury ’ s verdict unburdened the man named champmathieu from all accusation ; and champmathieu , immediately set free , walked away stunned , believing all men mad and not understanding a thing about the vision he ’ d beheld
1	those scots died thinking of ben lothian as the greeks died remembering argos
1	on the way , he gave providence its due
1	the best minds have their soft spots and sometimes feel somewhat bruised by the scant respect of logic
1	the next day jean valjean asked cosette again : would you like to go to the luxembourg ?
1	on hearing it , he had woken up with a start
1	the two duties : to watch and to hope
1	he saw civil war yawning open like an abyss before him and he knew that it was there that he would fall
1	behind it , on the other side , he could make out the tops of trees evenly spaced , which indicated that the wall divided the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees
1	orestes on a fast and pyladesnumber drunk
1	the vast barricade displayed itself like a cliff face where the strategy of the generals of africanumber came to grief and was shattered
1	people had only ever touched him to wound him
1	i can ’ t give you any dinner
1	this was the beginning of the end of the battle
1	her figure was hidden under a pelisse of black satin
1	the art of escape he ’ d once mastered rushed back to his brain like a flash of light
1	he was liberal , traditional , and bonapartist
1	do you love me ?
1	when it came down to it , he , fauchelevent , however nervous he might be , was not keen to cough up the money
1	and what does the gentleman do for a living ?
1	when javert had gone , monsieur madeleine turned to her , and said in a careful voice , struggling to sound as though he were in control and not on the verge of breaking down : i have heard you
1	i have a missus and a young lady—a very beautiful girl
1	he gazed at it the way a lamb would gaze into the eyes of a tiger
1	monsieur marius , are you there ?
1	any other uprising is bad
1	they remembered the popular ovation that greeted the neutrality of the numberrd regiment of the line in july number two intrepid men , whose mettle had been tested and proved in the great wars , the maréchal de lobau and general bugeaud , commanded , bugeaud under lobau
1	the cuirassiers hurled themselves at the english squares
1	éponine and azelma had made sure they did not forget to do so and had each put one of their shoes in the fireplace
1	jean valjean stuck his pistol under his arm and levelled a look at javert that needed no words to say : javert , it ’ s me
1	holy mother of god !
1	there is simply a story that can legitimately include them both
1	at last i ’ ve caught up with you again , monsieur , the philanthropist !
1	they lived modestly , as people do when they are in dire straits financially , although they always had a small fire
1	i ’ ll have lived my life in vain if you don ’ t enjoy them !
1	otherwise , it ’ s all over for you ; before too long , you ’ ll be caught in the wheels
1	those words mingled in his thoughts with a dim memory of the narrow corridors and black stairs he had just traversed
1	it was the spectre that had just passed before his very eyes
1	oh , yes we have , monsieur !
1	among all these passionate hotheads and true believers , there was one skeptic
1	the angel of the house is there , is always there ; if she goes away , it is only to return ; she fades like a dream only to reappear like reality
1	he went back to his old road between gagny and lagny to carry out graveling , on behalf of the state and under the surveillance of the administration , keeping his head down , a little downcast , extremely pensive , and with slightly cold feet as far as robbery went , since that activity had nearly sunk him , but turning all the more tenderly to drink , which had just saved his neck
1	that is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector ; number it is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire
1	there will be more joy in heaven over the tearful face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred righteous men
1	she herself , perhaps , did not know
1	i heeded the call
1	monsieur gillenormand was exasperated at his tales of casual amorous encounters near his barracks in the rue de babylone
1	and he advanced on the tips of his boots toward the corner marius had turned
1	let me off just this once , monsieur javert
1	would he have married her any the less ?
1	aren ’ t we going to get to know each other ?
1	a dreadful explosion burst over the barricade
1	revolutionary agitation opens up fissures there out of which popular sovereignty flows
1	or else , she would give him a little tap because he was coughing , and would say to him : don ’ t cough , monsieur
1	if i hadn ’ t been so keen to see cosette , i would not have made the confession i ’ ve just made to you , i ’ d have gone away ; but since i want to stay wherever cosette is and go on seeing her , i had to make a clean breast of it to you in all honesty
1	and off you went to the barricades , and you got yourself killed out of spite !
1	even when they miscarry , they are venerable , and it is , perhaps , in their failure that they are most majestic
1	could he be jean valjean ?
1	it ’ s obviously the end of this miserable terraqueous globe
1	the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes
1	then , without hurrying , but working deftly with a steady and rapid precision and swift movements all the more remarkable at such a time , when javert and company could arrive at any second , he undid his cravat , wound it round cosette ’ s body under the arms , taking care it would not hurt the little girl , then tied the cravat to one end of the rope using the knot that seamen call a reef knot , took the other end of the rope in his teeth , took off his shoes and his stockings and threw them over the wall , climbed on the pile of masonry , and began to lift himself up in the corner made by the wall and the gable as surely and steadily as if he had rungs under his heels and his elbows
1	what the hell happened ?
1	oh , i ’ ll find him all right !
1	her father is taking her to england and my grandfather refuses to consent to the marriage
1	besides , what use are words in the face of what offers itself with such luminous obviousness ? ]
1	as he was dwelling on this painful thought , lieutenant théodule came strutting in dressed like a bourgeois , which was a clever move , and he was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle gillenormand
1	but let ’ s exonerate the soldier , particularly the contemporary soldier , from such a charge
1	we have been pretty happy
1	this innocent bed that throws off its bedclothes , this adorable semi-nudity that is frightened of itself , this white foot that takes refuge in a slipper , this bosom that veils itself in front of a mirror as though the mirror had eyes , this chemise that rushes back up to hide a shoulder whenever a piece of furniture creaks or a carriage goes by , these ribbons tied , these hooks and eyes fastened , these laces pulled tight , these starts and jumps , these little frissons of cold and modesty , this exquisite alarm at every movement , this very nearly flapping anxiety where there is nothing to fear , layers of clothing as lovely as clouds at dawn—it is not right or proper that all this be recounted ; it is already too much to refer to it
1	barrecarrosse , or coachrod , alias monsieur dupont
1	this man looked like someone looking for a place to stay and seemed to stop by choice at the most humble houses along this dilapidated outer reach of the faubourg saint-marceaunumber
1	ah , you little beggar !
1	the moment the soldiers laid hands on the poor woman , who refused to get up , he stepped out of the shadows and said : just a moment , please !
1	mother jondrette studied him with a look that said : has this man talking to me gone stark raving mad ?
1	at the time of fantine ’ s return to montreuil-sur-mer , an unheard-of transformation had occurred in the production of these black goods
1	the search continued till nightfall ; they did not even find the body
1	the action had definitely happened , though , and marius could not doubt it , unless he doubted his own identity , as we were saying a moment ago
1	he had learned from a law student who regularly paced the salle des pas perdusnumber at the palais de justice that thénardier was in solitary confinement
1	the person who hands you this note is charged with bringing you to me
1	between hu\an and transhuman has been closed just as those old new age disciples had hoped ; and the celebrated british review the lancet can arrogate to itself the exorbitant right to remove the term inhuman from our vocabulary !
1	the whole day conversations like the following could be heard all over town :
1	he plays in the gutter and rises up out of it in revolt ; his effrontery persists in the face of grapeshot ; he was once a little guttersnipe , he is now a hero ; just like the theban boy , number he shakes the lion ’ s skin ; the drummer barranumber was a gamin de paris ; he yells forward , march !
1	he kept marius aloft and , with an unbelievable show of strength , made headway ; but he was sinking fast
1	marius was now wide awake
1	the soul , drifting with the current in the plumbless deep , can turn into a corpse
1	you poor little pooch , he said to it , did you swallow a barrel , then , for your ribs to be sticking out everywhere like that
1	such a find is a rarity , it attracts attention , not many people use the sewer to go about their business , whereas the river ’ s anybody ’ s
1	at that very moment he had a powder trail of friends scattered all over paris
1	and this lie , i ’ d have told it every day !
1	misery , we will say again , had been good for him
1	she was chatting away happily
1	so you forgive me !
1	what could have happened to the money ?
1	everyone knows how cats like to stop and dawdle wherever a door is half open
1	his hair was grey
1	the insurrection had turned the centre of paris into a sort of colossal , impenetrable , labyrinthine citadel
1	rather , the poetics of the historical age , in reversing the two rules of representation , multiplies the possibilities of figuration , the relationships possible between the subject , its form and its material
1	anyone who had seen them going past together would have taken pity on them
1	o zéphine , o joséphine , with your face like a slapped backside , you ’ d be lovely if you weren ’ t so cross
1	an thropology , human genetics and eugenics '
1	you must not have time to breathe
1	for me , you fell out of the sky , because i know you ; but the nuns , they need you to come through the door
1	all these young men , so diverse , and of whom , when it comes down to it , we should only speak seriously , shared the same religion : progress
1	appalling images rolled across marius ’ s mind
1	you could feel in the room that kind of religious terror that takes hold of the crowd when something great is being enacted
1	montparnasse answered : climb up this pipe
1	but she had to restrain herself
1	enjolras went and positioned three sentinels outside the barricades , one in the rue de la chanvrerie , the second in the rue des prêcheurs , the third at the corner of la petite-truanderie
1	but in number , a rumour spread around town one morning that , on the recommendation of the prefect , and in consideration of the services rendered the district , father madeleine was to be named mayor of montreuil-sur-mer by the king
1	so , for example , and we must insist on this , what the chiefs of the insurrection of number were fighting against , and in particular the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chanvrerie , was not louis-philippe exactly
1	monsieur madeleine immediately sent off another three hundred francs and wrote : hurry up and bring cosette
1	the soldiers , we have to say , were full of rage
1	it was like a hand opening and suddenly throwing a fistful of sunbeams her way
1	the man , however , had made a point of descending immediately to rejoin his work team
1	they were sleeping wide awake , rocking , cradled
1	on june number , number , the runoff from the heavy rain accentuated the steepness further , the mire making the climb even harder ; they not only struggled up but got stuck in the mud
1	so she picked up her bucket and fear made her reckless : bah !
1	he felt he was being brusque and that marius was being cold
1	meanwhile , it seems that you are neutral in the game being played out between your happiness and your unhappiness
1	we will be at the rue de l ’ homme-armé , no
1	no doubt a father with his son
1	the sky had that lovely undecided tone that might be white or might be blue
1	you ’ d have said he was seizing every opportunity to laugh his head off
1	his uneasiness grew with every thought that came to him
1	the embankment was no more ; dead bodies made the road level with the plain right to the very edge , like a perfectly measured bushel of barley
1	it seems that down there , out ailly-le-haut-clocher way , there was a fellow known as old man champmathieu
1	let ’ s note these facts calmly
1	society , the state , in diminishing his savings , had robbed him in a big way
1	bahorel and jean prouvaire caught up with them and swelled their number
1	it ’ s over , said the lawyer
1	in the audience there was a well-heeled retired merchant , a bit of a cheapskate , named monsieur géborand , who had made half a million manufacturing serge and other kinds of coarse woolen cloth , known as cadis and gasquets
1	homère hugu , a black man
1	a human projectile , no longer knowing what path to take and recoiling !
1	is this really the french language , the great language of humanity ?
1	i ’ ll have none of that , if only for economic reasons
1	on the contrary , now my little girl won ’ t die of that terrible disease , for lack of help
1	a throng broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vieilles-haudriettes and took some yataghansnumber and other turkish weaponry
1	jomini divides the battle of waterloo into four moments ; müffling carves it into three episodes ; charrasnumber alone , although on some points our appreciation differs from his , grasped with his proud glance the characteristic features of this catastrophe of human genius grappling with divine chance
1	jean valjean came every day
1	you should not have gone back to being unusual quite so soon
1	it was a glacial , regular , and hideous array
1	the cake fell fairly close to the edge
1	you ’ ll go in young , rosy , fresh , with your sparkling eyes and your white teeth , and your beautiful adolescent head of hair , and you ’ ll come out broken , stooped , wrinkled , toothless , horrible , with white hair !
1	there was a house there last century of which only the back wall remains , a genuine hovel wall rising to a height of three stories between the neighbouring buildings
1	some mother had spotted the gruesome chain and said to herself : now , there ’ s a nice toy for the kids to play with !
1	in a flower you gave me
1	as they passed by of a morning , the workers would see the poor little mite sitting on the cobblestones , nodding off to sleep and sometimes sound asleep in the dark , crouched and curled up over his basket
1	still , let ’ s not crow too loudly ; revolutions , too , can go wrong , and serious mistakes have been known to happen
1	she ’ ll be under the lid
1	he was the foreordained man of destiny who had forced all nations to say : that great nation
1	her debts had mushroomed
1	as luck would have it , the regiment lieutenant théodule belonged to came to be garrisoned in paris
1	their health is delicate
1	because they say we ’ ll just go and drink it all , we ’ re nothing but drunks and layabouts !
1	a moment later , he blew out his light
1	blachevelle , in ecstasy , leaned back in his chair and proudly closed both eyes
1	the mail coach left arras every night at one , after the mail from paris had passed , and arrived in montreuil-sur-mer a bit before five in the morning
1	the donkeys finished with , a new pleasure : they took a boat down the seine and then walked from passy to the barrière de l ’ étoilenumber they had been on their feet since five o ’ clock in the morning , as you ’ ll recall , but that meant nothing !
1	he knew every last detail of the broader canvas
1	after bruneseau , on january number , number , it had number , number metres
1	he realized this dimly but deeply as soon as javert had opened his mouth the day he came into his office
1	the ministry of the navy was beginning to be questioned over the sinking of the doomed frigate the medusa , number an event that was to cover the captain chaumareix with shame and the painter géricault with glory
1	it was that sweet absent being , that star that had shone for six months , those eyes , that forehead , that mouth , that beautiful vanished face that had brought down the night in vanishing
1	good holy virgin , next to my stove
1	matelotte is a dream come true of ugliness !
1	he—he , javert—had seen fit to decide , contrary to all police regulations , contrary to the whole social and judicial system , contrary to the code as a whole , in favour of a release ; that had suited him ; he had substituted his personal concerns for public concerns
1	we say narrow crevices and we can ’ t give a better idea of these dark , constricted , angular lanes , bordered by eight-storey slums
1	there are certain kinds of turbulence that stir up the bottom of the swamp , causing clouds of mud to rise up through the water
1	down to a level that social philosophy is still able to recognize , the work is good ; beyond this level , it is dubious and mixed ; deeper still , it becomes appalling
1	down with the great all , who gives me the willies !
1	she fled , went back inside the house and shut herself up in her room to reread the manuscript , learn it by heart , and daydream
1	prouvaire , the masons are cooling off ; you go and bring us the latest from the lodge in the rue de grenelle-saint-honoré
1	in the series , o and p are inseparable
1	marius was convinced that monsieur gillenormand—from that day forth he never called him anything else—had thrown his father ’ s will into the fire
1	but to start with , how did he manage to get into the convent ?
1	there , darkness ; here , shadow , but shadow full of flashes of light , and flashes of light full of radiance
1	his judgment was clouded
1	what ’ s there to worry about ?
1	what was this man with a bell hung on him like some ram or ox ?
1	it seemed to me that this might well have been what my brother was thinking in his heart of hearts
1	on this point , he was inflexible
1	to families torn by money worries and inheritance wrangles he would say , look at the devolny mountains , a place so wild you ’ ll only hear the nightingale there once every fifty years
1	victims to death anymore but by bringing the new hoiviunculus to life
1	the flirtatious garden once highly compromised had retrieved its virginity and modesty
1	sometimes , in the evening , at dusk , at the hour when the garden was deserted , he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the path that ran alongside the chapel , in front of the window he had looked in the night he arrived , turned to face the place where he knew that the sister making atonement lay in prostration and in prayer
1	here and there various blurred shapes could vaguely be made out , which , by day , were papers scattered over the table , open folios , books piled on a stool , an armchair heaped with clothes , and a prie-dieu , but at this hour , they were no more than dark shadows and whitish spots
1	i didn ’ t think to tell you to pick it up
1	last year , number , on a lovely morning in may , number a wanderer , the man telling this tale , arrived from nivelles heading for la hulpe
1	in number , pope alexander vii had issued a special bull authorizing the bernardines of petit-picpus to practise perpetual adoration like the benedictines of the blessed sacrament
1	marius left the hôtel de la porte saint-jacques , not wanting to run up a debt there
1	there are other beings you have to think of
1	monsieur , he said , you are the doctor
1	allow us , then , to speak of the past in the present tense
1	’ tis i , he said
1	the innkeeper ’ s here , said montparnasse
1	i am a student of talma
1	if you imagine paris lifted up like a lid , the underground network of sewers would , from a bird ’ s-eye view , describe a sort of great tree , grafted onto the river and spanning both banks
1	love is breathing in the heavenly air of paradise
1	at some semi-official ceremony or other—i can ’ t remember what—the comte —— ( this senator ) and monseigneur myriel were lined up to dine with the prefect at home
1	while the insurgents were reloading their fusils , the gunners were loading the cannon
1	they got past the barrière vaugirard without any trouble
1	you ’ re not from around here ?
1	duck out of the barricades , slip along the houses , ferret around the streets , and come back and tell me what ’ s happening
1	and don ’ t thank me , don ’ t tell me i ’ m taking you into my home
1	monsieur , said the little savoyard with that childish trust that is a blend of complete ignorance and complete innocence , my coin ?
1	from out of his own pocket , he paid the two teachers twice their paltry official salary , and one day when someone was expressing amazement over this , he said : the two most important civil servants are the nurse and the schoolteacher
1	the atom fraternizes with the hurricane
1	they heard the explosion , the assassin hit the pavement face first , and enjolras straightened up and ran his determined eagle eye around him
1	the job was urgent so they took him on
1	in her rapture , cosette was wild about old gillenormand
1	such are the immense strokes of luck , good or bad , that are calibrated by an infinity that escapes us
1	he came and went , climbed up , clambered down , climbed back up , bustled , sparkled
1	this produced bursts of light and dark outside , eclipses and lightning flashes , and inside , a sort of twilight
1	and yet he was seriously and profoundly troubled
1	well , you are sad every day
1	a stream trickled out of it with a tranquil sound
1	besides , the situation could hardly get any worse ; at a certain level of distress a crescendo is no longer possible and even thénardier could not make the night any blacker
1	remember the media of hate in the ex-yugoslavia of slobodan milosovic ?
1	she divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the secondhand dealer , gave the dealer back three quarters of the furniture , keeping only what was strictly necessary , and found herself without a job , without social standing , with nothing more than her bed and still owing about a hundred francs
1	he had never really thought about what the beauty of a woman was , but he instinctively understood that it was devastating
1	to do nothing is a woeful choice to make , don ’ t you know ?
1	bad has no right to exist
1	he glimpsed everything and saw nothing
1	it was called photography , which is writing with light ; and with the advent of photography , all lives entered the shared light of a writing of the memorable
1	i thought all that belonged to me
1	when cosette saw that her father was not in so much pain , that he was on the mend , that he seemed happy , she felt a contentment she didn ’ t even realize , it came on so gently and so naturally
1	the constellations begin to shine : how i would like it if in the darkness that runs over the blind flock , points of light , like that thought just now , could be fixed , in spite of these sealed eyes not making them out – for the fact , for the exactness , for it to be said
1	the traveller replied in some embarrassment : i don ’ t know , he wouldn ’ t let me stay
1	enjolras had advised two hours ’ sleep
1	and those around him chuckled
1	i ’ d rather go barefoot
1	after a few moments he lunged convulsively at the coin , snatched it off the ground , and stood holding it , motionless , staring off into the farthest reaches of the plain , casting his eye at all points along the horizon , upright and shivering like a frightened wild animal looking for a place to hide
1	reverend mother , i don ’ t say more often what , i say more often
1	what he thought was : i ’ ll be buggered !
1	the second row pushed the first in and the third pushed the second ; the horses reared , threw themselves backward , fell on their rumps , slid with their four feet in the air , knocking off and crushing their riders , no way of turning back
1	but the cooking degenerated and became execrable , and the wine , which had always been bad , was now shocking
1	this man is usually busy digging a hole
1	to cut a long story short , the barricade had fought like a gate to thebes , and the cabaret now fought like a house in saragossa
1	this family was the family of the cheeky little barefoot tramp
1	jean valjean—we will call him nothing else from now on—had got to his feet
1	one of them had a musket with a matchlock
1	let us give to chance what is chance ’ s and to god what is god ’ s
1	this never ceases to amaze people and yet nothing could be simpler
1	this individual conserns you
1	i ’ m not in this world to take care of my life
1	if you only knew !
1	he was here to say : hmmm , why not ?
1	let me refer you to article eighty-one of the law of december number , number , on arbitrary detention
1	he barely had the strength to stammer : but he can ’ t be !
1	but was the man actually hoping to hide effectively behind a heap of rubble anyone could just walk around ?
1	that ’ s more like it , he said
1	when the first bucket was empty , the girl drew a second , then a third
1	where ’ ll we find a little mite ?
1	the bear goes back to its lairnumber
1	they will say the funeral service
1	at around ten o ’ clock , one of the two or three people out and about in the rue plumet , an old bourgeois out late who was racing to get through that deserted and ill-famed stretch , passed close by the garden gate and got as far as the corner the gate formed with the wall when he heard a muffled and menacing voice say : i wouldn ’ t be surprised if he came every night !
1	where did you get these gold louis ?
1	she was the only one who could point the finger at her lover and sink him by telling all
1	at that point a grim love of life flared up in some
1	no , monsieur , it ’ s christmas
1	in the centre , above the dazzling white table , there was a venetian chandelier with flat crystal drops and every kind of coloured bird , blue , violet , red , green , perched among the candles ; around the chandelier , candelabra , on the wall , reflecting lamps with three or four branches ; mirrors , crystal , glassware , tableware , porcelain , faience , ceramics , goldplate , silverware , everything sparkled and rejoiced
1	but monsieur leblanc had taken off the big brown greatcoat he had been wearing over his blue redingote and thrown it over the back of the chair
1	that little bitch , answered mother thénardier , has dared touch the girls ’ doll !
1	twenty-five million is the most conservative estimate of the approximate figures provided by specialized science
1	the best of men are sometimes forced to delegate their authority
1	what are you getting at ?
1	thénardier gasped for breath on his wall like the shipwrecked survivors from the medusanumber on their raft , seeing the ship that had appeared vanish over the horizon
1	at the point we have reached in our tale , it might perhaps be useful to shine a beam of light on those young heads before the reader sees them sink into the shadows of a tragic episode
1	two things are needed for this , the greatness of paris and its gaiety
1	at écouen , to join the procession of the blessed sacrament in the proper rank , they distinguished between virgins and florists
1	monsieur madeleine left everything up to her
1	his fists clenched , his arms stretched out at right angles like a crucified man taken down from the cross and cast facedown on the ground
1	i ’ ll catch a cold
1	thénardier seized the letter in a sort of feverish convulsion
1	the fact is that she was ravishing in every way and that she had a breathtaking ability to distinguish between a hat by gérard and a hat by herbautnumber
1	the head that does not turn round toward horizons that have vanished can neither think nor love
1	every monday , marius had the clerk of la force prison send five francs to thénardier
1	an inferno of damnation , a hell
1	it ’ s a sceptre ending in an umbrella
1	you won ’ t get a thing !
1	haze and dimness are not accepted by the happy
1	cosette had never read anything like it
1	you take me into your home
1	the scottish greys , the horse guards , the regiments of maitland and of mitchell , the infantry of pack and of kempt , the cavalry of ponsonby and of somerset , the highlanders playing bagpipes under fire , the battalions of rylandt , the fresh-faced recruits who barely knew how to handle a musket holding out against the old hands of essling and rivolinumber—that is what is great
1	what are they fighting for ?
1	jean valjean corrected himself
1	yes , monsieur , the people have been suffering for a long time
1	at least , if we are to believe the tradition and , in particular , the two enigmatic lines in barbaric latin that a bad norman monk named tryphon , number who was a bit of a wizard , has left us on the subject
1	all of a sudden , from the depths of the shadows , a voice , all the more sinister because nobody could be seen and so it seemed that the darkness itself was speaking , cried : who ’ s there ?
1	and to soften up the authority figure he added : i won ’ t fall
1	one day her butcher , who had just caught sight of jean valjean , said to her : that ’ s a funny one
1	one morning , a few days after this visit by a spirit to father mabeuf—it was a monday , the day on which marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from courfeyrac for thénardier—marius had put this hundred-sou piece in his pocket and , before taking it to the prison clerk , had gone off for a bit of a stroll , hoping that this would make him work on his return
1	cosette dressed the wound morning and night with such a divine expression on her face and such angelic happiness at being useful to him , that jean valjean felt all his old joy return , his fears and anxieties evaporate , and he would gaze at cosette saying : oh , what a blessed wound !
1	for i ’ ll get you back in
1	cosette was all that remained of an otherwise extinct family ; she was not his own daughter but the daughter of a different fauchelevent
1	in the eighteenth century , the age-old melancholy of these mournful classes lifts
1	she ’ s seven years old
1	spring in paris is pretty often swept by bitterly cold and biting north winds that don ’ t so much freeze you as chill you to the bone ; these north winds , which mar the most beautiful days , have the exact effect of the drafts of cold air that rush into a warm room through gaps in a window or a door not properly closed
1	they are accused of raising , piling up , and packing a whole heap of miseries , sorrows , iniquities , grievances , and despairs against the reigning social order and of dredging up great blocks of darkness from out of the dregs as battlements that they can entrench themselves behind to fight
1	there ’ s nothing there , not even room
1	so , then , let ’ s not kill him
1	you ’ re going to catch a colb
1	shame on passions that make man petty !
1	no one ever knew
1	surely he wouldn ’ t dream of it
1	javert reached the bridge in time to see jean valjean on the other side of the water , leading cosette by the hand across the space lit by the moon
1	so he was going to find himself alone with cosette again
1	she returned to contemplating the notebook
1	a pretty big air vent , probably the manhole in the rue d ’ anjou , provided an almost sharp light
1	add the individual tortures to the national degradations and no matter who you are , you will feel yourself shudder before the habit and the veil , those two shrouds of human invention
1	what a godforsaken place , where the galley slaves are magistrates and tarts are looked after like countesses !
1	he came in , took a step , then stopped , leaving the door open behind him
1	on the fourth day , the army did what was done at zaatcha and constantine : number they bored right through the houses , they came over the rooftops , and the barricade was taken
1	everything has gone downhill in this century , even the scoundrels
1	the last of these stalls , set up exactly opposite the thénardiers ’ door , was a fancy goods shop , all glittering with tinsel and flashy beading , glass trinkets and magnificent things made of tin
1	this time , monsieur gillenormand capitulated
1	this is the example the old give to the young
1	come on , let ’ s examine our consciences , let ’ s listen to our hearts
1	hougoumont , for the antiquarian , is hugomons
1	principles wither and fade in your constitutional cave
1	then he turned toward the bed and , still sitting down , for he could not remain on his feet , he looked at the tiny black dress and all those little objects so dear to his heart
1	they ’ re not real , these particular savages
1	sometimes , beautiful as cosette was , marius would close his eyes before her
1	the defendant , it was true—and the defence counsel had to agree in good faith—had adopted a bad defence strategy
1	pardon me for sending my daughter and for not presenting myself myself ,
1	fear excuses such terrible inhospitality ; it merges with alarm , an extenuating circumstance
1	he set off , accompanied only by a boy who offered to act as his guide
1	he stood stock-still but did not let go of montparnasse
1	ah , young scallywag , you ’ ve got off lightly with me , you ’ re happy , but if i were fifteen years younger , we ’ d cross swords to see who ’ d get her
1	no , it ’ s not , your name is cosette
1	the one walking at the head looked decidedly suspect to him
1	he was more a victim of this miracle than transfigured by it
1	but i ’ m going to be chomping on your heart tonight !
1	abstruse speculations are dizzying , and nothing indicates that he polluted his mind with mystical claptrap
1	the eradication of destitution will occur through a simple rise in level
1	well , then , jean valjean went on , i ’ m the one who ’ s supposed to hand her the letter
1	it is by no means certain that he can read
1	from time to time the different parties slap new soles on their old insults
1	sin is like gravity
1	the age in which the arrangements of the exemplum and the historia are overturned by the new history ’ that men make without making it also underscores , with burke , diderot and lessing , the irreducible heterogeneity of the means of expression that every kind of material offers
1	as he was accustomed to doing whenever a stranger dined with him , he sat the man on his right
1	one day when the emperor was visiting his uncle , the worthy curé , who was waiting in the anteroom , found himself in his majesty ’ s path
1	and there were almost no roads , as we said earlier
1	he had let go of fantine ’ s hand
1	shall i admire england ?
1	he had gone home while the sun was still high in the sky
1	this was very nearly the case
1	yet jean valjean ’ s coolness won him over in spite of himself
1	he saw a gardener going past and he asked him : what is that ?
1	the ancient history of the sewer
1	besides , the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii created certain waves on the streets of paris
1	for hegel , as you will recall , the sheer resonance of music takes over from the capacity of pictures to show all
1	he wasn ’ t even big enough to go up to a hundred francs !
1	many thoughts came to him , but there was one that would not go away and that sent all the others scurrying
1	you could see the driver ’ s upper body above the parapet , whip in hand
1	wellington shouted to his old companions of talavera , vitoria , and salamanca : numberboys !
1	haven ’ t you said everything you can say ?
1	how many bushels of charcoal ?
1	after breakfast he collected his thoughts for a quarter of an hour ; then two generals came and sat on the bale of hay , plume in hand , a sheet of paper each on their knees , and the emperor dictated the order of battle to them
1	distraught , he carried cosette off in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean
1	he was unhappy with himself
1	now he could see and he admired the one and adored the other
1	o spring , you are a letter i write to her
1	how can we fail to see that , in the wake of the hecatomb of the great war , when braque and otto dix found themselves on opposite sides of the trenches in the mud of the somme , modern art for its part forgot about the wound and concentrated on the knife - the bayonet - with the likes of oskar kokoschka , 'the scalpel-wielding artist ' , before moving on through the german expressionism of der sturm to the viennese actionism of rudolf schwarzkogler and his cohorts in the s
1	let go of me , then !
1	when the mine is loaded with explosives , when the fuse is ready to run , nothing could be simpler
1	what are you going to eat ?
1	take your wild beast back
1	i only did so out of necessity , let me assure you , and not out of vanity
1	curtains do come down like that on life
1	the old man was stuck between the wheels
1	v it ’ s not enough to be a drunk to be immortal
1	their attendance in the chapel was interminable
1	what ’ s the name of that man ?
1	you think you are hearing hydras talking
1	and so , against the wind , it has rope and canvas , against water , wood , against rock , iron , copper , and lead , against the darkness , light , and against the vastness , a needle
1	but cinema , with its conscience-free eye , has a tool that can precisely enact the romantic concept of the work of art as the equality between a conscious process and an unconscious process
1	no tool is wrong for this particular labourer
1	the woman , who seemed timid and dumbstruck in front of her husband , risked a question : is that right ?
1	where were the other six ?
1	i ask you for one thing only
1	if you yell , if you cry , mother thénardier will spot you
1	venice , as a people , will rise again ; england , as an aristocracy , will fall , but as a nation it is immortal
1	there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life
1	he had no doubt about the end result
1	not only is everything from now on 'possible '
1	all small debts will be paid
1	petit-gavroche ran after them : what ’ s the matter , then , kids ?
1	what increased the secret suffering of old man gillenormand is that he kept it completely bottled up inside and never let any of it show
1	a cannonball does only six hundred leagues an hour ; light does seventy thousand leagues a second
1	i first set eyes on it when it was just a tiny mite
1	madeleine , lying almost flat on his stomach , was seen trying twice , in vain , to bring his elbows and knees closer together
1	i will never forget it ’ , he says
1	isn ’ t the court in recess ?
1	it goes without saying that such a man deserved not to have political opinions
1	monsieur madeleine drew three napoléons out of his purse and put them on the table
1	it was to women especially that his heart went out
1	this is known as seeing how the land lies
1	yet he held himself perfectly erect , so that he would look good in case anyone behind him should happen to be watching
1	it was a dull , broken , strangled , rasping voice , the rough voice of an old man made husky by brandy and spirits
1	he had not taken the letter éponine had given him without a thrill
1	the orion was later employed in brest as a training ship , but at the time it was part of the mediterranean squadron
1	a lot of forehead in a face is like a lot of sky over a skyline
1	but , jean valjean plowed on , i must stay
1	when he got down again from the scaffold , there was a look in his eye that made the crowd stand back
1	he ran to a candle in the downstairs room
1	the flames were causing an iron pot hanging on a hook to hiss
1	they do not lose sight of each other , but they lose their hold on each other
1	at last jean valjean began to feel the calmness of utter devastation
1	you ’ re right , she said
1	why d ’ yer think , monsieur ?
1	he fixed marius with a wild-eyed stare
1	you can see what torment he was in
1	keep going , said jean valjean
1	there , we lose all trace of him
1	he had finally plucked up the courage to go closer to the bench
1	jean valjean went pale
1	he stopped for a few seconds and seemed to be weighing it up
1	if you don ’ t have sunlight , you have to make it
1	he had himself religiously removed the imperial effigy from the cross napoléon had given him ; this created a hole that he did not want to fill with anything else
1	the spirit of paris , that demon that creates children of chance and men of destiny , unlike the latin potter , turns the common or garden-variety jug into an amphora
1	yet it is likely that the inhabitants were roused , for a small square dormer window on the third floor was finally seen to light up and open and an old man with grey hair was seen to appear at this window with a candle , openmouthed and frightened-looking—it was the porter
1	see the number map of parisnumber
1	nothing , we repeat , is left of it today
1	in the pruning season , he made twenty-four sous a day ; number after that he would hire himself out as a harvester , as an unskilled worker , as a farmhand or cowherd , as any kind of casual labourer
1	as he came to a street that struck him as being the rue du contrat-social , a gunshot , coming from who knows where and shooting across the darkness randomly , whistled past him very close ; the bullet went through a copper shaving dish hanging outside a hairdresser ’ s shop
1	fantine did not earn enough
1	the ordinary life that is the stuff of absolutized art , the uninspiring subject who passively commands the light machine 's recording and the nondescript historical agent who actively makes shared history are here made identical
1	she lived on the quai des célestins , at the corner of that ancient rue du petit-musc , which has done what it could to come up smelling like roses despite the odour of its bad reputation
1	the old world has given me an appetite
1	i was counting on the absentminded marius , who is pretty good on the whole , but he doesn ’ t come here anymore
1	wellington sat there , icily heroic
1	marius ran into courfeyrac , he ran to monsieur mabeuf
1	the face was not absolutely unfamiliar to marius
1	she continued : they ’ re a silly lot , they are , these peasants , with their nicknames !
1	five , you will say , that ’ s hardly likely
1	it had probably been written there during the night
1	first you enter the garden
1	when they had climbed over this little roadblock , they found themselves alone together in the lane
1	the end was near
1	the chemise , while we ’ re at it , he said
1	what you saw was night , emptiness , the dark , a winter fog mingled with vapour from the grave , a sort of terrifying peace , a silence in which you took in nothing , not even a sigh , a shadowland where you could make out nothing , not even a phantom
1	fauchelevent took a step back and cracked his knuckles
1	neither the convention nor the death of louis xvi , nor napoléon , nor the return of the bourbons—nothing had been able to erase the memory of this crowning achievement
1	this assignat from la vendéenumber had been nailed to the wall by the previous gardener , an old member of the chouan partynumber who had died in the convent and been replaced by fauchelevent
1	people could not get their bearings in the waste dump network any more than they could make themselves understood in the city ; up above , the unintelligible babble , down below , an inextricable tangle ; beneath the confusion of tongues lay the confusion of cellars ; daedalus replicated babelnumber
1	jean valjean answered : no
1	lord almighty , that poor queen i seen go by in the cart !
1	the gold elixir , he would shout , bestuchef ’ s yellow dye , général lamotte ’ s drops , number were , in the eighteenth century , one louis for a half-ounce vial , the great remedy for the catastrophes of love , the panacea against venus
1	number , where she was a folder and stitcher
1	ideas almost refuse to allow themselves to be expressed by these ex-convict nouns
1	what was this barricade made of ?
1	the windows of the dining room looked out onto the street
1	as the sun set at the end of the day , dragging out the shadow on the ground of the tiniest pebble , jean valjean sat behind a bush in a great red plain that was absolutely deserted
1	the police have discovered that this monsieur madeleine was none other than an ex-convict in breach of ban , sentenced in number for robbery , and named jean valjean
1	to the inhabitants of one area , he cited the example of the inhabitants of a neighbouring area
1	do you hear me ?
1	at barthélemy ’ s , near the barrière du trône , at capel ’ s , at the petit-chapeau , drinkers sang out to each other with heavy gravity
1	said marius , going white
1	the absolute power of art whereby yvetot is as good as constantinople ’ , is possible only on the basis of such a pact with the insignificant
1	expiring here is humiliating
1	when the master falls in france , he falls everywhere
1	what is that supposed to mean ?
1	it was a full moon that night
1	an imperceptible flush passed over monsieur leblanc ’ s face but he answered with his usual placidity , in his usual soft , steady voice : no more than before
1	i ’ m sick to death of him
1	the bourgeoisie is quite simply the contented section of the people
1	the bishop ’ s candlesticks were in their place on the mantelpiece
1	so , the felt outrageousness of history never ceases to find pictorial expression
1	if she asked him twice , he would simply smile by way of reply
1	my child , said the doctor , calm down
1	meanwhile the drinkers had started singing an obscene ditty and they were laughing so hard they shook the ceiling
1	in any case , whenever both happen to be sincere and good , no one gets on as well or becomes as close as an old priest and an old soldier
1	how ’ d he get out ?
1	the merchant pacing back and forth at the back of his stall had a bit of the effect on her of the eternal father
1	a worm in a carriage !
1	volcanoes are full of darkness capable of bursting into flame
1	he would have to be content with half of what he wanted
1	he set to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness out in the open air under the beautiful trees of the luxembourg , in the sun
1	the diamonds and rubies look wet and make the veiled ones cry , below in the shadows , veiled ones whose flanks are torn and bruised black-and-blue by cilices and by scourges with iron tips , whose breasts are crushed by wicker racks , whose knees are skinned by prayer ; women who believe themselves to be brides of christ , spectres who believe themselves to be seraphimnumber do these women think ?
1	evening came , the theatres did not open ; the patrols did the rounds looking peevish ; pedestrians were searched ; suspects were arrested
1	after that , montparnasse had eluded javert
1	he could distinctly make out in the shadow a stranger that fate mistook for him and pushed into the gulf in his place
1	he had not seen madeleine ’ s debut
1	i saw him go out a while ago
1	he was forced to admit to himself that he had entrusted it a tad rashly to that stranger whose face he couldn ’ t even see properly
1	i could have killed the cat !
1	that evening , he had gone to bed far earlier than usual , advising that everything in the house be locked up , and he had finally dozed off from sheer fatigue
1	but it is my bedoom you should see
1	someone called bonaparte , scapin the clown … that world is no more
1	he looked on the people coldly and they returned his look
1	let ’ s look at the worst that can happen
1	nothing much fazes him , still less frightens him , he derides superstition , deflates exaggeration , makes a mockery of mysteries , pokes his tongue out at ghosts , knocks people off their high horses , caricatures epic aggrandizement
1	in that same year of number , the products of the new process invented by father madeleine were featured at the industrial exhibition ; acting on the jury ’ s report , the king named the inventor a chevalier of the légion d ’ honneurnumber—thereby providing a new rumour for the small-town mill
1	with his passionate and grave nature , marius surrounded the man to whom he owed his father ’ s life , or so he thought , that fearless sergeant who had saved the colonel as the cannonballs and bullets of waterloo were raining down , in a sort of glory
1	'inertia is a raw form of despair ' , saint-exupery claimed , at the end of his life
1	he did not know
1	he finally reached the blaru glade after a good forty minutes , sweating , soaked , out of breath , clawed to bits , ferocious
1	the room was not one of those that are bothered by the broom , the ceiling brush , or the duster
1	a helpful and graciously austere half-light that dissipates childish fears and prevents falls from grace
1	you ’ re not a woman
1	she hadn ’ t eaten either , or slept
1	laze around doing nothing !
1	lack of sleep , lack of food , emotional turmoil had thrown him , too , into a hallucinatory state
1	he focused on the accent and the gestures , but his disappointment only grew ; this man ’ s was a nasal tone , absolutely unlike the sharp dry voice he was expecting
1	they heard these words , barely audible , come from his lips : dying is nothing ; what ’ s terrible is not to live
1	there exists a very respectable liberal school that does not abhor waterloo
1	she will only be a baroness , which is demeaning , for she was born a marquise
1	the park , now part of the bien nationalnumber but at the time owned by the army supply officer bourguin , number was open , as luck would have it
1	radiant faces , white foreheads , innocent eyes full of happy light , all kinds of auroras would scatter into the shadows
1	the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark ; later , mirages that are too sudden and too alive spring up in it as in a camera obscuranumber it should be gently and discreetly enlightened , by the reflection of reality rather than by reality ’ s direct hard light
1	at the bottom of a ravine , he found water that he had to wade through
1	most likely he also made out , through all the hazy notions of a poor and completely ignorant man , something excessive in it
1	the jondrette garret appeared before him
1	that ’ s what a funeral ’ s all about
1	one evening , marius was wending his way to their rendezvous along the boulevard des invalides , walking with his head down as usual
1	what do you make of marat applauding the guillotine ? number
1	the sister looked up and replied : yes
1	they left the flap of cloth where it was , without finishing it off
1	he emptied his glass and added : dear me , laigle of the funeral orations , number your coat has had it
1	what sank adam might save gavroche
1	and he rushed to the casement window
1	listen to this : —the high cost of kings
1	he ’ d thought of himself as quite young till then and had followed the fashions
1	the servant found a scrap of paper , which she handed to marius
1	what do you want ?
1	and cosette came back : how mean to have left us like that !
1	a little street , the rue du chemin-vert-saint-antoine , opened up between two yards enclosed by walls
1	such channels bored through are ineffaceable ; such formations , indestructible
1	she ’ ll find my letter
1	on their side , the insurgents posted sentinels at the corners of crossroads and boldly sent patrols beyond the barrières
1	he leaned over and spoke in a half whisper to lacoste , the guide
1	his friends shortened this to bossuetnumber
1	it is because of this decline that the convent gave up educating girls
1	at the renewed insistence of the hostess , the yellow man , the millionaire , finally consented to have supper
1	they yell and carry on , if you only knew what a scream they are !
1	these teachers do the fairs—i ’ ve seen them
1	just as demons and spirits recognize by certain signs the presence of a superior god , thénardier understood that he was dealing with someone very strong
1	it must be thrown down
1	fantine was beautiful and remained pure for as long as she could
1	tailor the song to his nature and stand back !
1	i ’ m going to die in a little while
1	the smile of the woman you love has a brightness you can see at night
1	lord uxbridge , who the next day buried his leg , had a fractured knee
1	she was usually on her own there , because from this gallery , which was up some stairs , you could see the priest or the officiant and that was prohibited to the nuns
1	tell me , will you do that for me and not cry ?
1	wherever jean valjean was , there was well-being
1	in prison , he said
1	he ’ s my friend , like i told you
1	fresh surprise for marius
1	they ’ ll hop in a cab together with my friend up behind
1	they ’ ve certainly been in a hurry to notify the doctor this time !
1	death is merely a prolongation of sleep
1	he called me father
1	one day he followed cosette to the rue de l ’ ouest
1	his eyes were closed
1	the sewer , in the old paris , was the meeting place of all exhaustion and all enterprise
1	we have to tell you , since this is history
1	what the eye of the peasant woman of efremov sees is this strange democracy that derives from a mechanical eye and ear that go everywhere , treat on an equal footing the light shining on the great and the small alike , offer a face , a voice and speech to the anonymous but never have to answer their questions
1	it would seem that the same red goatee popped up later with the same function in another riot , the quénisset affair
1	then he turned to jean valjean
1	this budding young soul changed hands from a prude to a pedantic prig
1	that ’ s what justice is !
1	we ’ ve got no time to waste
1	all i have to do is let things take their course
1	the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence , based on his clearly observable state of intoxication on the night of the ambush , and he was set free
1	and are you doing the trip on horseback with your regiment ?
1	gavroche stopped , patted his sides , fumbled in his fob gusset , turned his pockets inside out , found nothing , not a sou , and began to shout : help !
1	some extreme emotion was required to wring out of him , once or twice a year , that lugubrious cackle of the convict , which is like the echo of a demon ’ s laugh
1	what does that grisly pile of mixed bones buried beneath the furrows of waterloo make of that , i wonder ?
1	a local tradition , obviously exaggerated , has it that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the sunken road of ohain
1	take the example of the new neurotic realism of adman and collector , charles saatchi , as revealed in the london ( and new york ) exhibition , 'sensation ' , with its fusion/confusion of the tabloid and
1	ah , you had red hands in those days , mademoiselle ; they are nice and white now
1	they had a troupe of shady extras at their disposal for any secret underworld drama
1	by means of what organ ?
1	can ’ t a girl sit on a stone these days ?
1	for a moment or two he stood , drunk and tottering , with this whirlwind swirling around in his head ; then he looked up , stared hard at his grandfather and shouted in a thundering voice : down with the bourbons and that fat pig of a louis xviii !
1	one of the pallets was close to the door , the other close to the window
1	only , they were always looking up with a sort of off-putting assurance
1	in number , in a whole host of streets—rue de l ’ étoile , saint-louis , du temple , vieille-du-temple , notre-dame-de-nazareth , folie-méricourt , quai aux fleurs , rue du petit-musc , de normandie , pont-aux-biches , des marais , faubourg saint-martin , rue notre-dame-des-victoires , faubourg montmartre , rue grange-batelière , in the champs-élysées , rue jacob , rue de tournon—the old gothic cloaca still cynically flashed its gaping chops
1	the streets were deserted
1	this society was to survive even the decrees of the court of assizes pronouncing its dissolution
1	he had never seen anything like it
1	you ask around , talk to my landlord , i pay the rent on time now , they ’ ll tell you i ’ m straight down the line
1	accordingly : vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche ?
1	it is the ingratitude of nature
1	courfeyrac threw his arms around his neck
1	your beautiful white hands , madame la baronne , will have the honour of scraping and saving to make ends meet
1	he went to the window
1	in a decidedly fin de siecle world , where the automobile questions its driver about the function- ing of the hand brake or whether the seatbelt is buckled , where the refrigerator is gearing itself up to place the order at the supermarket , where your computer greets you of a morning with a hearty 'hello ' , surely we have to ask ourselves whether the silence of art can be sustained for much longer
1	destitution makes an offer , society gives the nod
1	sort things out amicably
1	there is bankruptcy in creation
1	this was where the thorn in the side was
1	at the end of the hour , aunt gillenormand said : lovely !
1	call me father and you ’ ll see !
1	monsieur , all wheels don ’ t just fit all axles
1	each man chooses his place as though at the theatre to see a show
1	she had seen it !
1	the cur was put behind bars
1	charlot said to charlotte
1	it was some poor unfortunate who was not quite literate , but not completely illiterate ; he had been a tumbler working the fairs as well as a public letter-writer
1	very eighteenth century : frivolous and grand
1	into a pretty skirt with a chemise
1	yet , the gravedigger continued , you can not serve two mistresses
1	an old man , who looked really old , was marching with this band
1	this gave them pause for thought
1	they played , they yelled at each other , they formed huddles , they ran around ; pretty little white teeth chattered away in corners ; the veils , from afar , surveyed the laughter , the shadows spied on the rays of sunshine , but what did it matter !
1	but he only managed to bag azelma
1	the glow from that sweet face lit up his own pale face
1	those who had seen jean valjean in the days when he was passing through digne , in october number , would easily have recognized all the components of this miserable fancy dress
1	he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it , stupidly happy , almost ready to laugh at the hallucination he ’ d been hoodwinked by
1	i don ’ t have the right to use it
1	this light added to the scarlet of the flag an indescribably terrible crimson
1	one morning an old woman who looked a bit dotty turned up on her doorstep and said , don ’ t you know me , mademoiselle ?
1	it comes and goes , moves toward the grave , then turns back toward life
1	he , for his part , accustomed to being found good-looking by the ladies , did not remember cosette any more than any other woman
1	the monarchy begins and ends in the ambulatory onlooker
1	one side of the double door cracked open a little and javert gave it a shove
1	the following month , they were short of money again ; the woman took cosette ’ s clothes to paris and pawned them at the mont-de-la-piété , the pawnshop , for the sum of sixty francs
1	for the second time , he stopped in his tracks
1	he walked over to the hedge for a look at the view
1	and so on , and so forth
1	he declared in his conscience that all that had been for the good
1	would you give me something to eat and a place to sleep ?
1	he ’ s just there , two feet away
1	that is , until the saatchi affair of autumn , when the exhibition 'sensation ' at the brooklyn museum , financed by ' christie 's interna- tional , had the unavowed aim of speculating on the value of the works on show
1	a limbo world in foetal state , something never before seen !
1	you save people ’ s lives and then you forget all about them !
1	he now crossed over the esplanade and the pont des invalides , the champs-élysées , the place louis xv , and turned into the rue de rivoli
1	yet one crucial aspect of this mutation of the seventh art has been too long ignored and that is the arrival of the talkies
1	and i say : erudimini qui judicatis terramnumber here lies blondeau , blondeau the nose , blondeau nasica , the bullock of discipline , bos disciplinae , the great watchdog of order , the angel of roll call , who was straight , square , punctual , rigid , honest , and awful
1	i will buy this pair of stockings , replied the man , and , he added , taking a five-franc coin out of his pocket and laying it on the table , i will pay for them
1	i swear we need to be on our own
1	more thousand-franc notes , no doubt !
1	now this , he muttered , is just the thing for plowing through dirt—or a man
1	we promised them solemnly to give them one
1	she murmured : but i might be going away and you can ’ t come !
1	one night , a doyenne of that special small world of high society , curious by right of seniority , ventured to ask : monsieur le maire is doubtless the cousin of the late bishop of digne ?
1	these six months are pretty moderate—the rule says all year , but hair shirts are unbearable at the height of summer and produce fevers and nervous spasms , so their use had to be restricted
1	he knew some artists ’ apprentices , a tribe closely related to his own
1	the war minister of the day , the maréchal soult , number who had seen austerlitz , watched it all with a sombre air
1	what are you giving us the once-over for like that ?
1	and gold is the lodestone
1	to stay a maid is all very well , but it ’ s chilly
1	proclamations addressed to the national guard of the départements were read in the middle of the street
1	the whole costume was , if we may use the word , tired ; the seams were going white , a sort of buttonhole was opening up on one of the elbows , and , on top of this , a button was missing on the breast of the coat ; but this was a mere detail , for the statesman ’ s hand had always to be inside his coat over his heart , the purpose being to hide the missing button
1	the heroic child answered : ah , well , but in that time , they ’ ll storm the barricade and i won ’ t be there
1	they were soon distracted by the commotion at the water ’ s edge , which they could make out through the branches of the great trees and which absorbed their attention completely
1	as for monsieur gillenormand ’ s two daughters , whom we have just mentioned , they were born ten years apart
1	it creates wealth to a wonderful degree ; it distributes it badly
1	it was the same hoarse voice , the same forehead , browned and wrinkled by the sun , the same open , wild , and wandering gaze
1	where did i get such a father ?
1	without a pass , he could not get back into the cemetery
1	but explain to me how my carriage , which is two paces away behind the trees , and my fine table and the guinea fowl i eat on fridays and my twenty-five-thousand-francs income and my palaces and my lackeys prove that pity is not a virtue , that clemency is not a duty , and that ’ number was not hideously ruthless
1	alix ( the big girl , nine ) : no , she doesn ’ t
1	the smaller branches , without breaking off the trunk , grow away from it
1	they usually gathered together at nightfall , which is when they woke up , in the wasteland next to la salpêtrière
1	the old man let out a laugh , shrill and grim , through which he coughed and spoke
1	a minute more and they ’ d have been in the fire
1	after a life of love , an eternity of love is , indeed , an increase ; but to increase the intensity itself of the ineffable felicity that love brings to the soul—that is impossible , even for god
1	enjolras , who was standing on top of the roadblock , fusil in hand , lifted up his handsome , austere face
1	fauchelevent began to bow once more
1	well , i don ’ t know , but it seems to me that that ’ s your son
1	while the voices went on singing , jean valjean no longer thought anything
1	this man and this woman were among such people
1	this done , she had laid it down in her arms and was softly singing to put it to sleep
1	down with the pope !
1	gavroche must have handed my letter to him , instead of you
1	said jean valjean , and suddenly springing up , foot still on the coin , he added : i ’ d get cracking if i was you !
1	people moved on to other things
1	everything else was banished from his thoughts
1	he was from outside the département
1	marius now had no weapon ; he had chucked his pistols once they were discharged , but he had spotted the powder keg next to the door in the downstairs room
1	enjolras broke off at this point rather than stopped ; his lips moved silently as though he were continuing to talk to himself , which made the men watch him closely , straining to hear him still
1	he felt its icy breath brush right up against him , at his back
1	so let ’ s count the herd for a bit
1	the field of waterloo today looks like any other plain ; it has that calm that belongs to the earth as mankind ’ s impassive support
1	solitude , silence , night ; a mysterious chill that bit to the bone
1	in number , the cowardly breach of silence on the part of the taciturn legislative body , emboldened by disaster , was worthy only of outrage , and it was a crime to applaud ; in number , faced with those treacherous marshals , faced with a senate that lurched from one dirty deed to another , insulting where once it had deified , faced with this idolatry collapsing and then spitting on the idol , it was a duty to turn away
1	meanwhile , the man went on , i still haven ’ t paid what i owe
1	he was over a hundred
1	whoever sees paris feels like they have seen the hidden side of the whole of history with the sky and the constellations in the gaps in between
1	it was all over
1	rome was of the same temperament
1	the old gothic slang is crawling with it
1	paris is a maelstrom where anyone can lose themselves and everyone disappears in the world ’ s great whirlpool just as they would do in the whirlpool of the sea
1	savages getting about stark naked , their noggins tizzed up like shuttlecocks , with clubs in their paws , aren ’ t as savage as these gay young blades !
1	the squares , eaten into by the frenzied cavalry , dwindled without flinching
1	the saint bartholomew killers , september cutthroats , avignon slaughterers , assassins of coligny , assassins of madame de lamballe , assassins of brune , miquelet militia , followers of verdet , cadenette-wearing soldiers , companions of jesus , the chevaliers du brassard—that is riot for you
1	take that however you like
1	for , of all the tortures that he had suffered in this long testing that destiny had subjected him to , this one was the most awful
1	monsieur leblanc seized the moment
1	humanity realistically represented is a humanity that has withdrawn – like the face of the jew at the window which is not so much a victim 's face , frightened or resigned , as a seer 's face , already removed from humanity , witness to a cataclysm even more astonishing than it is horrible
1	ruthless , yes , said the bishop
1	as we see , the two barricades , although physically isolated , were very much of one mind
1	can you imagine , monsieur javert , he sent me packing , because of a pack of old harlots who tell tales and stab you in the back in the workshop
1	how i miss the days when i used to see bonaparte and talma going into the bal-sauvage arm in armnumber seditious words—six months ’ jail
1	another time he received the death notice of a gentleman of the district , which laid out , in one long page , not only the honours of the deceased but all the feudal ranks and titles of nobility of every one of his relations
1	when you say convent , you say swamp
1	but he had to know first of all if it really was javert
1	there are paper mills , tanneries , distilleries , big clock factories , steel mills , copper foundries , at least twenty iron foundries—four of them at lods , châtillon , audincourt , and beure are very big concerns—
1	the only thing they noticed especially was two candlesticks of an old-fashioned shape standing on the mantelpiece , which looked like they were made of silver since they bore hallmarks
1	we haven ’ t a clue who they are
1	forcing her to choose between the death of her child and the death of her conscience
1	as he passed by the cathedral square , he shook his fist at the church
1	being in jail for a crime does not prevent a person from getting another crime off the ground
1	held a seizure of goods in his beak ;
1	easy to do , too
1	i ’ d like to go and listen to musettes in the woods
1	people don ’ t know what they should know and know things they should not
1	cosette was used to the enigmatic side of her destiny and scarcely noticed her father ’ s odd ways
1	it was written in the colonel ’ s handwriting and this is what it contained :
1	ships being built there sit under a bell jar , so to speak
1	they saw him go up to the stove where there was never a fire and where the pipe , you know , was puttied with yellow clay
1	this was the last of the cartridges
1	no one ’ s ever heard of him !
1	the arrest of monsieur madeleine caused a sensation in montreuil-sur-mer , or , more precisely , an extraordinary commotion
1	the corridor through which jean valjean was now wending his way was not as narrow as the first
1	this helps make sense of the title of that heinrich heine institute conference , 'the elimination of nature as a theme in contemporary art '
1	i say that jean valjean and madeleine are the same man , and i say that javert had no killer other than javert , and when i say something , it ’ s because i have proof
1	who is the mademoiselle euphrasie in question ?
1	a host of souls , evil , vile , or bitter , who have passed through life and vanished into eternity are there , almost intact and in a way still visible in the form of a monstrous word
1	it was getting bigger , it seemed to move along in an orderly fashion , and yet it was all spiky and shuddering ; it seemed to be a conveyance but you could not make out its load
1	the inspector muttered : the long-haired bloke would have to be brujon , and the bearded bloke would have to be demi-liard , alias deux-milliards
1	it was broad daylight and yet the child slept on
1	misery , prostitution , police officers , saint-lazarenumber—that ’ s what those beautiful delicate girls will come to , those fragile marvels of modesty , of kindness and beauty , fresher than lilacs in the month of may
1	but éponine would not let go and kissed him all the harder
1	and chewed on a bit of bread
1	the whole point of love is to stray
1	all the bottomless pits had opened up again inside him
1	he was in the grip of a whole host of new sensations
1	they thought they could hear voices singing in infinity ; they had god in their hearts ; destiny appeared to them as a ceiling of stars ; they saw above their heads a glimmer of the rising sun
1	your third estate is insipid , colourless , odourless , and shapeless
1	one day an arrogant cook , a cordon bleu , number of the noble race of concierges , presented herself
1	it seemed to him that these remote splendours , far from dispelling his own darkness , made it all the more funereal and black
1	it involves all the work on variations and combinations of images – reproductions , icons , idols – trivializing multiple images of governors or stars ( andy warhol ) ; transporting official images of the young mao to the piazza san marco in venice ( erro ) ; combining a portrait of miss america with a snapshot of a vietnamese prisoner of war being beaten up ( wolf vostell ) ; further mummifying the mummified portrait of brezhnev ( erik boulatov )
1	the two vertical strokes would be the rue de la grande-truanderie and the rue de la chanvrerie and the horizontal stroke would be the rue de la petite-truanderienumber the old rue mondétour cut the three strokes at the most tortured angles
1	on june number , number , robespierre on horseback was thrown from the saddle
1	but what proved that this thief was champmathieu ?
1	you could say that it created man a second time , by giving him a second soul , power
1	youth , even in its heartaches , always has a luminosity of its own
1	when the five men sent back to life had gone , enjolras went on to the man condemned to death
1	beyond the agnus deis and the ave marias , number the only thing mademoiselle vaubois had an inkling about was the different ways of making jams
1	the street suddenly went black
1	two of the brigands clapped their hands on his shoulders and the masked man with the ventriloquist ’ s voice stood facing him , ready , at the slightest movement , to smash his skull in with a blow of the giant key
1	for the gulf to close up again , someone had to fall in—himself or the other man
1	i ’ m the unlucky one ; i ’ m on the outside , looking in
1	he feels buried at once by those two infinities , the ocean and the sky ; the one a grave , the other a shroud
1	it was the interior of that mournful and severe house known as the convent of the bernadines of perpetual adoration
1	take advantage of it
1	for two days the riot had strongly agitated , outraged , and preoccupied monsieur gillenormand
1	in all the years i ’ ve lived here , he said , this is the first time anyone has been to my home
1	this put the smile back on the king ’ s face
1	he strolled beneath these windows until the light went out
1	you see that we have no bad intentions
1	there are words and incidents that wake up even those in the depths of despair
1	little by little he recovered
1	he is the first abbé of clairvaux
1	the english army was profoundly shaken
1	those minutes in which we live through centuries have this supremely and wonderful peculiarity , which is that while they go past , they fill our hearts completely
1	they were the kind of men who , diminished in number , grew in heart
1	in the dismal war of june number , one insurgent , an awe-inspiring shot who was fighting from the top of a roof garden , had himself brought a voltaire armchairnumber up there ; a blast of grapeshot found him seated in it
1	of course they recognize you !
1	look at me , hanging his key on his nail !
1	you will remember that the last time he escaped , he had already been on a mysterious trip there or in the general environs , which the law got wind of
1	he occasionally went in for gentle raillery but there was almost always a serious message involved
1	a hole in the heart is not satisfied with a stopgap
1	i loved you , says the corpse
1	and i ’ m leaving for palestine
1	he was , along with the comte gérard and the comte drouet , number one of napoléon ’ s maréchaux in pettonumber the treaties of number stirred him up like some personal offence
1	fauchelevent grabbed the shovel and jean valjean the pick and together they buried the empty coffin
1	the two little boys trotted along behind mechanically , holding each other by the hand
1	this intersection being a junction , the point is a node
1	feeling that all extremes meet and that , if you are not careful , abasement of fortune may lead to baseness of soul , he jealously watched over his pride
1	were explained , they stood for urbain fabre , and ursula ’ s name was no longer ursula
1	as he lifted her up , he touched her hand
1	would he find it in time ?
1	i was as hungry as a wolf before i came here ; but you are so good , that , now , i don ’ t know what ’ s hit me ; it ’ s gone
1	that said , he forgot all about the lancer
1	from the top of the pile the space that had to be climbed to reach the top of the wall was only about fourteen feet , if that
1	i was saying , monsieur , dear patron , jondrette resumed , leaning on the table and contemplating monsieur leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of a boa constrictor , i was saying that i had a painting for sale
1	one of them had made himself a dagger out of a shoemaker ’ s hook by snapping the hook off and sharpening the stump
1	they didn ’ t seem to be in any hurry and yet they were walking faster than i was
1	they had gone to bed in silence
1	he ate whatever he could garner for dinner
1	jean valjean began to understand
1	the next day at dusk marius arrived in vernon
1	paris very quickly gets used to everything—it ’ s only a riot—and paris is so busy that it does not trouble itself for so little
1	oh , i ’ m not excessive
1	only once , at one of these departures , had she accompanied him in a fiacre as far as the corner of a little cul-de-sac , where she read : impasse de la planchette
1	javert ducked , the cobblestone flew over him , hit the back wall , taking out a huge chunk of plaster , and then bounced back , ricocheting from corner to corner across the room , which was happily almost empty , to come to rest just behind javert
1	badly , answered jondrette , with a terribly distressed and grateful smile , very badly , my worthy monsieur
1	the fortress was complete
1	how would he ever get out of there ?
1	the little girl , taking this remark seriously , began to wail again , louder than ever , quite beautifully
1	they put up with him because of his good humour
1	during the afternoon of this same christmas eve of number , a man had been strolling up and down the deserted part of the boulevard de l ’ hôpital in paris for quite some time
1	so , he had thénardier at last
1	sixty francs down the drain
1	a fat flemish servant promptly set the table for him
1	the hull had not been damaged on the starboard side , but a few planks had been pried open here and there , according to custom , to let air into the shell
1	but by being in too much of a hurry to sit down , you can even stop the march of the whole human race
1	each was the image of the man who built it
1	the basket will be made of pine and the lid will be a black sheet
1	one of the four was known as the baby because she was the youngest ; and one was known as the old girl
1	then , turning back to the elder girl : well , then !
1	what is your name ?
1	this repression was not accomplished without noise , without that tumultuous racket peculiar to clashes between the army and the people
1	they ripped officers ’ epaulets off
1	you like apple turnovers , mesdames , but don ’ t eat too many of them
1	this thénardier , if you took him at his word , had been a soldier—a sergeant , he claimed ; he had probably taken part in the campaign of number , and even acquitted himself quite bravely , so it would seem
1	from that moment , as we saw , he was a different man
1	everyone on the job
1	one day she said to jean valjean : father , let ’ s take a stroll down there for a bit
1	for many years now , from the time my hair turned white , i ’ ve sensed that many people think they have the right to look on me with contempt ; for the poor ignorant hordes , i wear the face of the damned and , hating no one , i accept the isolation hate brings
1	right , right , sit down , said the old man
1	he was obviously surprised that a man could talk like that
1	they go back five hundred years to a raoul de faux , a jean de faux , and a thomas de faux , who were all noblemen , one of them being a seigneur de rochefort
1	him on top , me inside
1	you speak such amazingly good sense
1	with familiarity gone , with this vous instead of tu , with this madame and this monsieur jean , he was a different person for cosette
1	blindness does not exist where there is certainty
1	two candles were burning on it , one in a bright green copper candlestick , the other in the neck of a cracked carafe
1	the bag revealed to bystanders this name written in big black letters on a card sewed to the material : marius pontmercy
1	a second later the door opened again , mademoiselle gillenormand did not come in , but showed herself at the doorway ; marius was standing , mute , his arms hanging , with the face of a criminal , monsieur gillenormand was pacing up and down the length of the room
1	he endured it , exasperated
1	no pocket was so dingy it did not hold a bit of money , no abode so poor it did not enjoy a bit of joy
1	the day after a wedding is lonely
1	i ’ m going up to my room
1	she broke off , not daring to go any further
1	the thénardiers , however , hung on to the kid and dished out a hundred poor excuses
1	at fifteen , she came to paris to seek her fortune
1	there was only one door still ajar through which my past could erupt into my present life
1	on the side of the french , in this battle of the cuirassiers , delord , l ’ héritier , colbert , dnop , travers , and blancard were out of action , but on the side of the english , alten was wounded , barne was wounded , delancey was killed , van meeren was killed , ompteda was killed , wellington ’ s entire staff was decimated , and england came off worse in this bloody juggling act
1	yet it ’ s only ten years ago
1	this question summed up the situation and woke jean valjean out of his reverie
1	one where the water is still , but deep
1	around the time when workers take a break , two men were seen meeting between the barrière picpus and the barrière charenton in a little covered way between two walls near a barkeeper ’ s who had a siamese draught board on a card table out front
1	we ’ re a crossroads , here
1	before the man had time to say another word , she added : i don ’ t think so
1	if a candle appeared , he slapped on a mask
1	but that did not stop you from having your sword by your side
1	so then , i couldn ’ t earn enough and that ’ s when all the bad luck started happening
1	he took an old shovel and spread the ash over the wet embers so as to hide them completely
1	and then , to tell the truth , although the judge was a good man and smart enough , he was at the same time a committed and almost ardent royalist , and he had been shocked that the mayor of montreuil-sur-mer , in speaking of the landing in cannes , had used the word emperor and not buonaparte
1	let ’ s see what they ’ ve got in their paunches
1	a machine made of spirit
1	it is likely he was holding counsel with himself
1	sister , he said , are you alone in the room ?
1	you very often saw , at the dip where the sides of a street or an intersection ended , wide square grates with big bars whose iron shone , burnished by the feet of the crowd
1	after dinner , he said to courfeyrac : come and i ’ ll take you to a show
1	in that case , said javert , forgive me if i insist—it is my duty—you have not seen this evening a person , a man
1	then she opened the window and ran her eyes all around , hoping to be able to turn up something of the street , a corner of a house , a patch of pavement , and be able to watch for marius there
1	gavroche buried his fist in another of his pockets and pulled out a note folded in four
1	since we are in the process of giving details about what was once the convent of petit-picpus and have dared to open a window on this discreet refuge , we hope the reader will allow us a further small digression , one basically foreign to this book but typical and useful in showing us that even the cloister has its original characters
1	a young working girl passing close by one day said : now there ’ s a widower who ’ s nice and neat
1	there was no bread and no meat
1	the danger of the position was the forest of soignes , then right alongside the battlefield and cut off by the ponds of groenendael and boitsfort
1	since everyone had the plateau , no one had it and , in a word , it remained for the greater part to the english
1	just as the brother and sister were getting up from the table , there was a knock at the door
1	he had to wait for the bulk of his army corps and he had been given the order to mass his forces before entering into battle ; but at five o ’ clock , seeing the peril wellington was in , blücher ordered bülow to attack and said this remarkable thing : we must give the english army time to come up for air
1	this was precisely the same month that the thénardiers , having demanded twelve francs instead of six , had just upped it to fifteen francs instead of twelve
1	jean valjean found himself , with marius still senseless , in a sort of long underground corridor
1	it ’ s the small jug of red at six a shot
1	the lamp shone on him from one side , the fire from the other
1	you need a small anvil two inches square and a spirit lamp to soften the wax
1	what makes a riot ?
1	you are so graceful
1	above this frightening nest of shadow , the upper floors of houses stood out , livid ; at the very top , the chimneys were turning white
1	here , where the collège rollin stands today , there is a square where the rue neuve-sainte-geneviève joins the rue des postes
1	the nights may be cold but the days are hot
1	enjolras was more manly
1	that said , she curtseyed to marius and to jean valjean
1	the republic , the empire , had been nothing but monstrous words for him till that moment
1	the ideal of some twirp of twenty about to marry is to be like monsieur royer-collardnumber and do you know what the world ’ s coming to with that kind of stateliness ?
1	would it have changed her , cosette ?
1	louis-philippe was a broad-daylight kind of king
1	cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her smock , and went green
1	he held it up to the candle , looking for the initials
1	fauchelevent ’ s turn had come
1	something awful will happen in town tonight
1	there , you saw a barrier of black shutters , secured and reinforced by wooden crossbars painted a gingerbread yellow
1	marius did not ask himself any of these questions
1	this time the jig was up
1	there ’ s a five-hundred-franc note in the chest of drawers
1	v sundry thunderbolts fall on ma bougon
1	the streets of the quartier latin , which were crawling with students and working girls , number saw the beginning of this idyll
1	the long-haired one dug the other one in the ribs and said : with patron-minette , you can ’ t go wrong
1	the restoration had been one of those intermediary phases that are hard to define , in which there is weariness , buzzing , murmuring , dozing , uproar all at once—phases that are nothing more or less than a great nation coming to a standstill
1	none of the puzzles he ’ d hoped would be cleared up had been illuminated ; on the contrary , they had all , perhaps , become even more opaque ; he knew nothing more about the beautiful girl from the luxembourg gardens or about the man he called monsieur leblanc , except that jondrette knew who they were
1	the old woman wondered
1	a charter is a mask ; underneath it is the lie
1	near the fontaine de l ’ arbre-sec , there were gatherings , motionless gloomy groups , standing amid the eddying hordes like stones in the middle of a running stream
1	he was writing to her !
1	théodule , for his part , even with his nose on the inheritance , rebelled at the chore of pleasing
1	whenever he passed through a village , ragged little urchins would gleefully run after him and surround him like a cloud of flies
1	he sometimes held his own with monsieur de bonald and even monsieur bengy-puy-valléenumber
1	cosette would not have been able to come without monsieur fauchelevent
1	are you an inn ?
1	the english , replied the prowler
1	but the goal of the outing seemed achieved
1	napoléon , seeing the old boy give him the once-over with a certain curiosity , wheeled round and said brusquely : who is this little man staring at me ?
1	in the paris of the day there were two thousand two hundred streets
1	the saintonge regiment was part of the army of the rhine , for the old regiments of the monarchy kept their provincial names , even after the fall of the monarchy , and were not dragooned into the army until number pontmercy fought at spires , worms , neustadt , turkheim , alzey , and mayence , number where he was one of the two hundred who made up houchard ’ s rear guard
1	monsieur gillenormand wrung his hands with a frightening burst of laughter
1	the planet was , in fact , very close to the horizon at that moment and passed through a thick layer of mist that gave it a horrible red colour
1	nothing told him which part of the city he was crossing or what way he had come
1	mother thénardier ’ s raucous voice came back : don ’ t worry
1	to think about the dark is a serious thing
1	what i am doing at this moment , god , who is on high , looks down upon , and that is enough
1	it was the opportunity
1	it was evident to anyone familiar with the man ’ s straight , clear , sincere , righteous , austere , and ferocious conscience that javert was emerging from some huge inner struggle
1	we won ’ t have to tell any lies
1	six o ’ clock , said marius
1	and can we be sure we didn ’ t do anything before we were born ?
1	do you know them ?
1	pigritia is a terrible word
1	the french army was dressed in white , austrian style , the regiments were known as legions , and instead of numbers they wore the names of départements
1	dew is good , monsieur
1	you come and find the grandfather , who ’ s not a bad old stick at heart , and who always has a few rolls of louis lying around in an old drawer , and you say to him : grandfather , this is how it is
1	] number as for me , i ’ m for caesar alone
1	no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
1	after the promotion of domestic consumerism via the euphoria of radiophony , it is now production that finds itself beefed up with a sound backdrop designed to improve office life
1	to be the empire of such an emperor—what more splendid destiny for a nation , when that nation is france and when its genius is added to the genius of the man !
1	he had taken the purse to the local police chief as lost property placed by the finder at the disposal of any claimants
1	only her sweet face was visible ; her hair was beautifully tousled , her eyelids were still swollen from sleep
1	they never disturbed him , not even by a sign , once he had begun any course of action
1	monsieur madeleine had known nothing of all this
1	those august hands no longer stirred
1	this was the reflection of the torch burning in the corinthe barricade
1	when he did not take cosette , she stayed with the old woman ; but nothing thrilled the little girl more than to go out with the man
1	the day begins in tears
1	in the rue du cimitière-saint-nicolas , an officer of the national guard , pursued by a troop armed with clubs and foils , took refuge after much ado in a house where he was stuck until that night , and could then only leave it in disguise
1	it ’ s cold in here !
1	mother thénardier went back to her stove and tasted what was in the pot with a wooden spoon , grumbling all the while : there ’ s some at the spring
1	shall we use a wet finger !
1	she followed him as stealthily as an old cat and managed to see him , without being seen , through the crack in the door directly opposite
1	who on earth can that man be ?
1	the greatest dangers are within us
1	you are going to live
1	for some hours now , javert had stopped being a simple man
1	to contemplate leads to action
1	duty could have dead ends !
1	i must have heard wrong
1	and so , said the bishop , i intend to proceed without an escort
1	the rule of martin verga
1	loved by cosette , he was happy !
1	you can see for yourself we ’ ve got a joint to case icigo , added babet
1	monsieur , he said , the palais de justice , please ?
1	where are we going to sleep tonight ?
1	the dragoons advanced at a walking pace , in silence , their pistols in their holsters , sabres in their sheaths , carbines in their rests , with an air of grim expectancy
1	a soul for a bit of bread
1	so , what are you waiting for ?
1	those are god ’ s lots
1	gave ’ em their money backnumber
1	but nothing could induce marius to spill the beans
1	a contorting triumph rippled and bloomed across that narrow forehead
1	thanks to genomics , you can now enter the human system in the same way as you break into a computer bank - without leaving any trace a tall
1	the heat of the burning coals was so great that the candle on the table was melting fast and had burned right down on the side nearest the stove
1	your burned muff , your lost boa !
1	be that as it may , dripping with sweat , drenched with rain , his clothes in tatters , his hands skinned raw , his elbows bleeding , his knees torn to shreds , thénardier had reached what children , in their figurative language , call the sharp edge of the wall of the ruin , he had lain on it stretched out to full length and there , at that point , his strength had failed him
1	she was always following at his heels
1	and what a splendid transfiguration !
1	the time that had gone by since koblenznumber was declared nonexistant
1	the butcher ’ s refusing credit , he won ’ t give us any more meat
1	white attacking white is ferocious ; if the lily could talk , it ’ d make mincemeat of the dove !
1	destiny makes such about-faces
1	we ’ ll break the door down !
1	yet they got along at quite a clip
1	he said ; it was his painful refrain
1	i ’ d prefer a ghost to a gendarme any day
1	my name is félix but i ’ m not happy
1	the social observer should step into these shadows
1	every one of them dreamed they were zétulbé
1	the porte saint-jacques , the porte paris , the barrière des sergents , the procherons , the galiote , the célestins , the capucins , the mail , the bourbe , l ’ arbre-de-cracovie , the petite-pologne , the petit-picpus—these are names from the old paris , lingering on in the new
1	it is terrifying , questioning the shadows
1	o , my brothers , this is the very spot where those who think and those who suffer come together as one ; this barricade is not made of cobblestones , or wooden beams , or scrap iron ; it is made of two heaps , a heap of ideas and a heap of pain
1	these are the joys of life
1	hang on a bit longer
1	it is a sort of dark polyp with a thousand antennae sitting in the earth and growing down below at the same time as the city above
1	the address ran : to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint-jacques-du-haut-pasnumber it contained these few lines :
1	this ferocious lynch lawnumber is not something any party has the right to reproach others with , for it is applied by the republic in america just as much as by the monarchy in europe
1	we no longer have a clue
1	what ’ s this got to do with me ?
1	yet while marius pinned her with a stunned and sorrowful look , the young girl was pacing up and down the garret as though she owned the place , with the audacity of a revenant
1	the mattress slid down between the two clothes poles and fell to the street
1	this point has never been cleared up
1	anyway , they are as ugly as can be , and i ’ d prefer a round table in mahogany
1	god can not add anything to the happiness of those who love each other except by giving them endless duration
1	i give it its due , nothing more
1	the counsel for the prosecution wound up by insisting that in the absence of javert , the three witnesses brevet , chenildieu , and cochepaille be heard again and solemnly cross-examined
1	such are the old monasteries of spain
1	a small rosebush sat dried out in a corner , forgotten
1	his daughter could try as she might to tell him , but he is your grandnephew , after all
1	i don ’ t know if you follow me , monsieur pontmercy , but to go off now , not see her anymore , not talk to her anymore , not have anything anymore—that would be hard
1	the solitude of a place where so many crimes had been committed had something awful about it
1	they took the boulevard
1	crime , intelligence , social protest , freedom of conscience , thought , theft , all that human laws pursue or have pursued , has hidden in this hole ; the maillotinsnumber in the fourteenth century , highwaymen in the fifteenth , the huguenots in the sixteenth , morin ’ s visionary illuminatinumber in the seventeenth , the chauffeurs , number those brigands who burned their victims ’ feet to make them talk , in the eighteenth
1	the judge of the royal court of douai , who was presiding over this session of the circuit court in arras , like everybody else , knew this name , so thoroughly and universally honoured
1	i succored the oppressed , i relieved the suffering
1	a mere wall separated him from these abandoned beings that lived groping around in the dark , beyond the land of the living
1	they also seized from the cell a half-empty bottle containing the remains of the laced wine with which the soldier had been knocked out
1	so no more jacquerie
1	i ’ ll have a hammer , a chisel , and some pliers in my pocket
1	the instant madeleine ’ s eyes met javert ’ s , javert , without moving , without stirring , without coming a step closer , became truly terrible
1	the military academe excommunicated him as it went under
1	this looked less like a human being than some sort of shade that the twilight had just hatched
1	the armchairs had disappeared
1	the rest of you , said thénardier , search him
1	he ate the bread and opened the wallet
1	enjolras ’ order was executed with the due haste peculiar to ships and barricades , the only two places of combat where escape is impossible
1	'the effect is so immediate that no words spring to mind
1	the bishop ’ s face immediately took on that expression of gaiety peculiar to hospitable natures : let ’ s eat !
1	the old man quietly took it on the chin and suffered in silence
1	they don ’ t get a lot of people passing through in those parts
1	they went to the watchmaker ’ s
1	nothing to expect , nothing to hope for
1	this madame thénardier was a redhead , fleshy , yet bony ; the soldier ’ s-wife type in all its ghastliness , and with an odd bent look acquired from devouring romantic novels
1	in seizing the colours , he had received a sabre cut across his face
1	the downstairs room had spruced itself up a bit
1	at the entrance to the rue de l ’ homme-armé , the fiacre stopped
1	the subject of his sermon was charity
1	was marius and cosette ’ s happiness from now on condemned to such kinship ?
1	after napoléon , louis xviii
1	one of the blocks of shadow covered the whole wall that marius was leaning against in such a way that he disappeared
1	there is nothing to be said on that score
1	while cosette and toussaint are sleeping
1	resources dry up , necessities loom
1	he was something of a mason , something of a gardener , something of a doctor ; he bled a postilion once when he fell off his horse ; louis-philippe never went around without his lancet any more than henri iii did without his daggernumber the royalists scoffed at this ridiculous king , the first to have spilled blood as part of a cure
1	in the erasure of things that disappear , in the diminishing of things that vanish , philosophy recognizes everything
1	the sweat , the heat , the journey on foot , the dust , added a strange sordidness to his shabby appearance
1	the mother would die
1	the great assault and battery of number , number when poland was partitioned , got him going more than anything else
1	father madeleine required goodwill of the men and pure morals of the women and honesty of everyone
1	so , come to the chaumière ! number
1	conserve , conservation , conservative—that was more or less the entire lexicon
1	his brain had lost all power to retain ideas , they rushed through like waves and he grabbed his forehead in both hands to try and stop them
1	the son , regretting the swans , kept his head turned toward the pond until a flowerbed hid it from him
1	things get stuck , they won ’ t shift
1	what ’ s he got in his mitt , then ?
1	fancy getting them to take the armchairs away !
1	a palace and her heart
1	beautiful with a beauty both entirely womanly and angelic at once , with a complete beauty that would have made petrarch sing and brought dantenumber to his knees
1	a big blue handkerchief of the kind invalids use to blow their noses was tied like a shawl around her waist and largely concealed it
1	did she want to go out ?
1	in shrugging off the opinions of his grandfather to don the opinions of his father , he thought he was set ; he now suspected , anxiously and without daring to admit it to himself , that he was not
1	dishonesty espoused number , divine right hid itself behind a charter , fictions made themselves constitutional , prejudices , superstitions , and ulterior motives , taking article number to heart , cloaked themselves in liberalism
1	poor mothers , go and make pretty boys , why don ’ t you !
1	is it the eighteenth century ?
1	the colonel was perhaps wrong to accept these conditions , but he bowed to them believing he was doing the right thing and hurting only himself
1	does taking waterloo away from wellington and blücher mean taking something away from england and germany ?
1	marius was poor and his room was fairly bare ; but , just as his poverty was noble , his attic was clean
1	he no longer saw night , he saw blue skies
1	it ’ s just that , you see , there ’ s something that has to be said about taking post-horses … does monsieur have his passport ?
1	it won ’ t be for long
1	they spent several years in this way
1	father fauchelevent had insisted monsieur madeleine have the main room , and he was forced to accept it , for jean valjean had resisted in vain
1	this man of lofty virtue had three domiciles in paris solely for the purpose of evading the police
1	cosette lifted her head and replied : yes , monsieur
1	javert was in appalling pain
1	in neither case was there any right of reply
1	the king , in his inexhaustible clemency , has deigned to commute his sentence to that of hard labour in perpetuity
1	his whole face expressed this one idea : what ’ s the use ?
1	these salons did not stay pure for long
1	the description is fair , but incomplete
1	moral of the story : love defeated by colic
1	before such a soul , we can feel nothing but respect
1	now you mention it , yes , said dahlia , the famous surprise !
1	i don ’ t know anyone !
1	in a word , was this genius , as many historians of note have thought , on the wane ?
1	it was a second piece of ordnance
1	too right , uncle , said théodule
1	it ’ s for the poor
1	it doesn ’ t even have any drawers
1	for him monsieur madeleine had kept all his prestige
1	at one end of the room , where he found himself , worried-looking judges in worn-out robes were biting their nails or closing their eyes ; at the other end , the rabble in rags , lawyers in every possible pose , soldiers with hard , honest faces ; tarnished old wainscoting , a dirty ceiling , tables covered in serge that was rather more yellow than green , doors blackened by hands ; nails planted in the panelling , small tavern-style oil lamps providing more smoke than light ; on the tables , candles in brass candlesticks ; gloom , ugliness , sadness ; and from all this a sense of the austere and the august emanated , for you could feel that great human thing known as the law and that great divine thing known as justice in that room
1	the men began talking in low voices
1	ah , you don ’ t like the idea of working !
1	they ’ re saying the forty-hour prayers
1	when there were no more chiefs left alive except enjolras and marius at the two ends of the barricade , the centre , which courfeyrac , joly , bossuet , feuilly , and combeferre had held for so long , folded
1	after which he opened the gate , let the man out with his load on his back , shut the gate again , and bolted , not caring too much to get mixed up in the episode as it happens and especially not wanting to be there when the murderer chucked his victim into the river
1	let ’ s go for what is real
1	monsieur madeleine forced a smile
1	this provided an accessible and pragmatic element in all combeferre ’ s views
1	and you ’ ve gone into the choir for your work ?
1	my friend , he said to the stable hand , is there a wheelwright around here ?
1	within a few seconds , his expression had shifted from unbridled violence to a calm and relaxed cunning
1	it was a lot
1	i was with monsieur baloup , he put me up in his house
1	jean valjean was thoughtful without being glum , which is typical of affectionate natures
1	thénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of february number they never did find out how , and through whose connivance , he had managed to procure for himself and hide a bottle of that wine invented , they say , by desrues , which has a narcotic mixed in with it and which the endormeurs gang , number the dopers , made famous
1	listen , what is really unlucky is that i have these strings here in my heart that keep me bound
1	and yet , in later years , as we shall see further on , madame magloire found decorative paintings on the walls of mademoiselle baptistine ’ s chamber underneath the distempered wallpaper
1	how happy i will be !
1	take a breather , tholomyès , said blachevelle
1	the more you talk , the less you paint !
1	he did not study god , he was dazzled by him
1	old coats are exactly the same as old friends
1	he kept the sixteen sous and gave the five francs to the girl
1	all the blessings will fall away before they reach heaven , and only the curse will rise as far as god !
1	he bent over and looked at her
1	first he hands over twenty sous , then five francs , then fifty francs , then fifteen hundred francs—just as easily every time
1	for a gamin to hit the pavement is like a giant hitting the ground ; gavroche had only fallen the better to rise again ; he stayed sitting there on his haunches and , with a long trickle of blood streaking his face , he lifted up both arms in the air , turned his head to where the bullet had come from , and began singing :
1	the healthful , pure , vital , joyful , freely breathable air flooded him
1	end of the petit-picpus
1	did they stop at the scalp ?
1	the man looked at cosette ’ s poor red feet and continued : when will she be through with this pair of stockings ?
1	but , golly , said the boy , we didn ’ t have a home to go to anymore
1	the bandages were complex and difficult , for fixing pads and cloth in place with surgical tape or sticking plaster had not yet been dreamed up at the time
1	babet ’ s diaphanousness was in stark contrast to gueulemer ’ s meatiness
1	at the moment that the moonlight superimposed itself , so to speak , on this inner limpidity , the sleeping bishop appeared bathed in glory
1	he was not sure he was himself
1	the righter of wrongs , striking caesar , may strike too hard and be unjust
1	everything had the air of having lived a long time ago and of holding out doggedly against the grave
1	on the one hand , he would say , a public servant can ’ t be deceived ; a magistrate is never wrong
1	and the whole barricade clapped
1	the cabaret siege had begun
1	to become honest and good again
1	otherwise , he was a real swindler
1	was he , in the middle of the distractions and amorous diversions that filled his life , suddenly hit by one of those mysterious and terrible jolts that sometimes come and strike at the heart , bowling over the man public calamities couldn ’ t shake , threatening as these did only his existence and his fortune ?
1	he had one other worry : to teach himself , which he also described as saving himself
1	éponine started to laugh and leaped up to kiss him
1	in the smoke all this was glimpsed rather than seen
1	did you pick up your coin , at least ?
1	the noise of the rusty hinge had woken no one
1	the doorkeeper of the mairie had been put in place by the emperor
1	the implausible was natural there
1	you ’ ll be a wood louse in a cellar
1	the police officers , reemerging from the cadran gallery , had thought they heard the noise of footfalls coming from the direction of the ring sewer
1	one respects the reverential silence of the happy couple
1	out of the corner of his eye gavroche had assured himself that father mabeuf was still sitting on the bench , though perhaps asleep now
1	he sniffed around the law for a bit , but he never did it
1	go out of the barricade as fast as you can—gavroche , anxious , started to scratch his ear—and tomorrow morning , take it to the address on it , to mademoiselle cosette at monsieur fauchelevent ’ s place , rue de l ’ homme-armé , number seven
1	he stopped the horse and asked the man : how much further is it from here to arras ?
1	what had these men done ?
1	such a loan was only allowed on the part of novices
1	the senator , encouraged , took up the challenge : come on , let ’ s be good chaps
1	whoever is free is scrupulous ; whoever votes , reigns
1	it reverted to stammering about a charter
1	from the opposite side of the boulevard , the car with the masks was facing the car with the bride
1	this is the primitive foundation of every human language , what we might call the bedrock
1	history is that time in which those who have no right to occupy the same place can occupy the same image : the time of the material existence of the shared light of which heraclitus spoke , the sun of judgment none of us can escape
1	in the days of mathurin régniernumber the tavern was called the pot-aux-roses and as plays on words were all the rage , the sign was a post—poteau—painted rose pink
1	but as soon as they spot you , they remember they have a trade and that they have to make a living and they offer to sell you an old woolen stocking full of cockchafers or a clump of lilac
1	this point of the quai is not very far from the house brought from moret to paris in number by colonel brack , and known as the house of françois inumber a guardhouse sits right alongside it
1	whoever was around inhaled happiness ; life smelled good ; all of this nature gave off candour , succour , support , fatherliness , tenderness , a golden yellow freshness of dawn
1	finding his way was hard
1	every time the wind blows , it sweeps away more of humanity ’ s dreams than clouds in the sky
1	this was the other half of the english cavalry , so justly celebrated
1	… the day when we no longer suit you , crush us , but until then , help us to walk
1	there are people who have nothing !
1	'these offices are so quiet that the slightest noise , such as the phone ringing , disturbs people 's concentration which , of course , can lead to stuft- , ups
1	they pulled a sour face at every flourishing of the nation
1	the racket was indescribable ; trapped and burning smoke almost blanketed the fight in total darkness
1	fauchelevent felt himself teeter and almost fell into the grave himself
1	the dog and the cat were habitual table companions ; cosette ate with them , under the table , from a wooden bowl just like theirs
1	i am performing a duty , i am the sorry convict
1	it was an improvisation thrown up by ferment
1	as soon as they were alone , old man thénardier offered the traveller a chair
1	he began by passing judgment on himself
1	and who knows , anyhow ?
1	he prescribed an infusion of pure quinine and , if she became feverish again overnight , a soothing potion
1	you can take me , for here i am
1	everyone milled around gavroche
1	of a poor lover who hanged himselfnumber
1	marius had not left his place
1	the first cry of the enlightened and growing hordes is : death to thieves !
1	it ’ s all coming along nicely , replied jondrette , but my feet are frozen
1	there was a blow with a stick
1	there ’ s been a mistake , i ’ m telling you
1	this other lifer , who had come straight from jail and who was dressed in red like chenildieu , was a peasant from lourdes , half man , half pyrenees bear
1	you didn ’ t see a sort of godforsaken rodentlike little muscadinnumber of a fop getting about over that way by any chance , did you ?
1	let ’ s do our duty !
1	what can i do ?
1	you can go straight in
1	marius had got into the habit of walking down this path without thinking
1	since the restoration contests this title , which i have paid for with my blood , my son will take it and bear it
1	she was born at montreuil-sur-mer
1	it was the sound of muskets being cocked
1	marius had vanished ; it was over , what could she do ?
1	i made lint all the time , here , monsieur , see , it ’ s all your fault , i ’ ve got calluses on my fingers
1	they ’ re a bunch of vermin
1	the winds of change blow there as irresistibly as everywhere else
1	so why go there ?
1	the silence of the redoubt was probably beginning to worry the besiegers , causing them to fear some unexpected development , and they were probably feeling the need to see clearly through that heap of cobblestones and to know what was going on behind that impassable wall that took fire without returning it
1	toussaint had replied , stunned
1	she preferred an hour with him to her ravishing tête-à-têtes with catherine
1	he had barely finished when mother thénardier , indeed , rushed into the room , flushed , winded , panting , her eyes ablaze , and shouted , whacking both her thighs at once with her huge hands : false address !
1	he blessed and was blessed in return
1	i never twist anything
1	he felt the tug of an unknown feeling
1	jean valjean had some trouble moving and walking
1	the two men , chatting away standing-stock still in the snow that was swirling down , formed an association that a police sergeant would definitely have kept his eye on but that marius barely noticed
1	she grabbed the handle with both hands
1	he said to the man : why is the bread here so bitter ?
1	the hospital was a low , narrow , single-story house with a small garden
1	her creditors were harassing her
1	and there were all kinds of little treats on top of that
1	or the short straw !
1	then his eyes dropped to the four uniforms
1	little by little , for some time , he had been moving away from strict dogma and venturing into the wider fields of progress , and he had even come to accept , as a definitive and magnificent evolution , the transformation of the great republic of france into the vast republic of humanity
1	he cleared away the stones , lifted out the grate , loaded marius , inert as a corpse , onto his shoulders , and with this burden on his back , he dropped down into this sort of luckily fairly shallow well , using his elbows and his knees , let the heavy iron trapdoor fall shut over his head and the stones roll back over it again , and found his footing on the flagstone surface ten feet below ground
1	the amphictyonsnumber held two sessions a year , one in delphi , home of the gods , the other in thermopylae , home of the heroes
1	he said to himself : when i ’ ve finished my balls of blue , i ’ ll be rich , i ’ ll get my copperplates out of hock , i ’ ll get my flora back on the shelves with a bit of charlatanism , some hefty handouts under the counter , and a few ads in the papers , and i ’ ll buy , and i know exactly where , a copy of pierre de médine ’ s the art of sailing , the edition of number , with woodcuts
1	i ask nothing more
1	his slithering , his bearing , his mysterious darting movements caused him to resemble those crepuscular spectres that haunt ruins and that old norman legends call alleurs—goers
1	everything was the colour of dirt , even the sky
1	in the corner opposite grantaire , joly and bahorel were playing dominoes and talking about love
1	in the morning , everything was streaming , in the afternoon , everything is shining in a powdery haze
1	what geese these young men are !
1	a crisis was obviously brewing
1	shot of all moral or emotional compromise , the painter seeks to move 'towards the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea , between the idea and the onlooker '
1	the brutus who killed caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy
1	the bell tower of what was once their village forgot them ; the boundary of what was once their field forgot them ; after a few years ’ sojourn in jail , jean valjean himself forgot them
1	third : tailing is good , with relays of officers at intervals , but for important occasions , there ought to be at least two officers who do not lose sight of one another , so that if , for any reason , an officer takes sick on the job , the other can keep watch over him and stand in for him
1	the bourgeois talked peacably with the workers about what was ginnying up
1	after checking five or six housefronts barricaded in this fashion , the kid shrugged his shoulders and tackled the matter with himself in these terms : i ’ ll be buggered !
1	there was a stove in one corner burning away with glowing embers you could see
1	bossuet burst out laughing
1	the old man had had a shock and had given as good as he got , and so terribly that , in the blink of an eye , assailant and assailed had switched places
1	he always got away , sometimes resisting with violence
1	marius was a bronze vase , but old man gillenormand was an iron pot
1	citizen , i gave the letter to the porter
1	the simpleminded police of the restoration tended to view the people of paris through rose-coloured glasses
1	thénardier helped jean valjean get marius back on his shoulders , then he headed for the gate on his bare feet , tiptoeing , beckoning to jean valjean to follow him ; he peered outside , placed a finger to his lips and remained sort of suspended for a few seconds ; the inspection done , he put the key in the lock
1	when she entered this hovel , she filled it with paradise
1	well , then , jean valjean continued , keep the money for your mother
1	can you make head or tail of it ?
1	she glanced at it
1	and , anyway , where would he go ?
1	the pampas of south america would appeal to me , if i didn ’ t have the arcades of the odéon
1	from his window he could see the courtyard in front of the house and the street
1	he put the supporting evidence in his pocket
1	it had projections , corners , black holes , recesses where the roof dipped down , bays , and ridges jutting out
1	some say a trumpet blast was heard sounding the charge from the direction of the arsenal , others that a boy stabbed a dragoon with a dagger
1	after a pause , gavroche added : for the little ones i ’ ll use a ladder
1	she started to tidy the tables ; the husband paced up and down the room
1	daring deeds dazzle history and are guiding lights for mankind
1	on june number , number , his family took flight and hid in the woods
1	no one and everyone
1	enjolras shook his hand with a smile
1	and then , above all , marius felt inexpressibly revolted in thinking that it was monsieur gillenormand who , for entirely stupid reasons , had torn him mercilessly from the colonel , thereby depriving the father of the son and the son of the father
1	and so , he shut himself up in it , he lived in it , he was utterly happy there , leaving aside the prodigious questions that lure and terrify , the unfathomable perspectives of abstraction , the heady precipices of metaphysics , all these profundities that converge , for the apostle , on god , and , for the atheist , on nothingness : fate , good and evil , the war of being against being , man ’ s conscience , the pensive sleepwalking of animals , transformation by death , the summing up of existences in the grave , the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the enduring self , essence , substance , being and nothingness , the soul , nature , freedom , necessity—thorny problems that are sheer drops , murky depths , over which the colossal archangels of the human mind hover ; awesome abysses that the likes of lucretius , manu , saint-paul , and dantenumber contemplate with blazing eyes that , by staring hard at infinity , seem to cause stars to hatch there
1	bossuet shouted to the gunners
1	was anarchy now about to descend from on high ?
1	i want to stay
1	he cast a furtive glance at the door as though he feared it might open despite the bar that held it shut tight ; then with an abrupt and violent move , he grabbed in a single armful , without so much as a quick glance at them , these things he had so religiously and perilously hoarded for so many years , and took the lot , rags , stick , haversack , and threw them on the fire
1	he also made his way out of the garden , walking backward , obliged , to keep the dog ’ s respect , to resort to that manoeuvre with the stick that masters of this style of fencing call la rose couverte
1	say everything ’ s fine and i ’ ll be right down
1	still the little boy could not get to sleep : monsieur ?
1	i mean that man has a tyrant , ignorance
1	who was going to worry about that ?
1	we need to reform and transform
1	dada today is still for war
1	as his mouth was alluring , his lips the most rosy red and his teeth the whitest in the world , his smile made up for what was severe in his whole physiognomy
1	sixth : the detainees , known as barkers , that call the other detainees to the visitors ’ room , make the prisoner pay them two sous to call out their name clearly
1	he looked ahead as far as the eye could see and saw nothing
1	he would say with authority : the french revolution was a bunch of rotters
1	he was about halfway down the street , level with a very low wall that you could step over in certain places and that bordered a patch of wasteland , and he was walking along slowly , preoccupied as he was , the snow muffling his footfalls , when , all of a sudden , he heard voices talking quite close by
1	the man opened the wallet and pulled out , not a fistful of banknotes as thénardier had hoped , but a simple bit of paper , which he unfolded and presented , open , to the innkeeper , saying : you ’ re right
1	he was antinous , number wild
1	after all , a person has the right to rob a corpse he has made
1	this weakness had led him to make a foolish concession
1	it is its antechamber ; but , like rich people who display their greatest riches at the entrance to their palace , it seems that death , which is close at hand , puts its greatest miseries in this , its vestibule
1	he seized éponine by the arm
1	gavroche was stuck for a reply , so he stayed there , undecided and scratching his ear sadly
1	but i just can ’ t stop myself from congratulating you
1	you can talk to me , it doesn ’ t wear me out
1	but perpetual movement still remains the rule
1	we are describing the state of a mind on the move
1	to die of love is to live from it
1	nearly all the trees in the orchard were wildings ; he budded them and got them to yield excellent fruit
1	twice a year , on the first of january and on saint george ’ s feast day , marius wrote dutiful letters to his father that his aunt dictated and that you would have said were copied from some manual ; this was all monsieur gillenormand would tolerate ; and the father answered with overwhelmingly tender letters that the old man pocketed without reading
1	the old biddies gave up the ghost , saying : after all , he ’ s a sort of adventurer
1	even when loyson takes wing , you know his paws are firmly on the ground
1	it was as though something of the repose of the dead had entered into jean valjean ’ s tranquillity
1	he bought the watch for forty-five francs
1	he saw what he saw , and that was that
1	marius gave a shudder
1	fauchelevent wiped his forehead
1	but she declared that she was the first to detest them , and then again , she had reached her ferociously devout phase
1	aren ’ t there any more seats ?
1	it was roughly eighteen feet high
1	it seemed that it was a disembodied evocation speaking to you from across the barrier of the grave
1	it ’ s like a small republic
1	it is the day of destiny
1	try to imagine this forest of dark branches known as the sewer underneath that
1	for instance , since you ’ re a millionaire , i told you i demanded money , a lot of money , enormous amounts of money
1	nothing could have been more unexpected , more surprising , and , we have to say , more unpleasant
1	so , he said , that ’ s enough of that
1	in the morning , when he used to come into my room , i would growl at him , but for me it was like sunshine streaming in
1	i ’ m not attacking you , of course , my dear senator
1	the second is about the distribution of pleasure
1	she was to monsieur gillenormand what we saw monseigneur bienvenu ’ s sister was to him , always by his side
1	that ’ s all there is to it
1	you ’ ll find monsieur bossuet there
1	how can we fail to see here the catastrophic
1	the years end up giving a head a windswept look that is most distinguished
1	we have already pointed out this typical detail
1	i have my writer ’ s stall in the market in the rue de sèvres
1	there is nothing harder to drill through and penetrate than the geological formation that the marvellous historical formation known as paris sits on top of ; as soon as work , in any shape or form , begins and ventures into that nappe of alluvial sediment , subterranean resistance abounds in the form of liquid clays , springs , hard rock , the soft deep silt that the special science calls mustard
1	she seemed to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her
1	the man was evidently beyond the reach of horror or desperation
1	as we ’ ve already explained , with first love , you take the soul well before the body ; later on you take the body well before the soul , sometimes you don ’ t take the soul at all ; the faublases and the prudhommesnumber add : because there isn ’ t one ; but happily this bit of sarcasm is blasphemy
1	louis-philippe had been handsome and he remained graceful even in old age ; not always approved of by the nation , he was always approved of by the multitude ; he was pleasing
1	the french poet wanted to steal from the brightly shining stars the right light not only for illuminating the workers ' faces , but to consecrate the shared sojourn
1	you ’ re going to say that i could have tendered my resignation , but that is not enough
1	right you are , replied the father in a gentle tone that contrasted with the young girl ’ s abrasiveness
1	lordy , yes , rue plumet
1	when i think that my girls go barefoot and don ’ t have a dress between them !
1	the beggar raised his head and answered in a doleful voice : thank you , my good sir
1	on the first floor , hold your axes ready to cut off the staircase
1	he still had his yellow redingote , his black breeches , and his old hat
1	you can ’ t shock a people into going any faster than they want to go
1	but the grapes can ’ t have been ripe ?
1	what am i after now ?
1	the youngest of the three was to collect from a great-aunt a tidy sum of a hundred thousand livres in bonds ; the middle son was to step into his uncle ’ s title as duc ; and the eldest was to succeed to a peerage held by his grandfathernumber the bishop would listen in silence to this innocent and forgivable maternal showing off
1	yes , answered enjolras , but not as much as on the life of jean prouvaire
1	he stood with more than half his body showing above the top of the redoubt
1	certain magnificent and rowdy cortèges , notably the fat ox , number the special model of a prize ox , enjoyed the same privilege
1	the fathers ran after the exempt-gangs in desperation
1	how has a criminal act been committed against me by you ?
1	the night before , in the dark , the barricade had been approached as silently as if by a boa
1	the tenth year , his turn came again , he took advantage of it again
1	prioresses and mother superiors almost always bear names impregnated with a particular gravity , recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ , like mother nativity , mother conception , mother presentation , mother passion
1	she handed it to her husband
1	his laugh was faint and chilling and gave marius goosebumps
1	let ’ s admit without bitterness that the individual has his own distinct self-interest , and can without committing a crime make that interest clear and defend it ; the present has its excusable dose of egotism ; the life of the moment has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself endlessly to the future
1	what the hell is that ?
1	a year went by , then another
1	why , with so much money in his purse , the miserable getup ?
1	in some places the wall was covered with gnarled funguses that looked for all the world like tumors ; the stone itself seemed sick in that unbreathable environment
1	it appeared that some bohemian , some barefoot gypsy , a dangerous beggar of a man was in town at that actual moment
1	when bossuet and courfeyrac turned round , half the street was already barricaded with a rampart taller than a man
1	youth is the season when bones are swiftly mended and wounds rapidly healed
1	and we will then see god
1	for her part , cosette sank into black despond
1	for this surprising ineptitude is not new ; it is no youthful idiocy
1	his daughter , marie-louise , married adrien-charles de gramont , son of the duc louis de gramont , a peer of france , colonel in the gardes françaises and lieutenant general in the army
1	ah , you have some communication to make to me
1	soon we will even be able to intervene with precision on energy levels and mechanical , mus- cular and neurological elements ' , one expert claims
1	the only wise creatures in all of creation are the turtledoves
1	it ’ s my beard that saved me !
1	and he signalled jean valjean to listen
1	how did you get here ?
1	they ’ re silver ; but for me , they are gold , they are diamond ; they change the candles you put in them into altar candles
1	while fantine had been slowly sinking deeper and deeper into destitution , her native town had prospered
1	ah , the little cur !
1	the bishop sent for him , gently chastised him , and appointed him verger of the cathedral
1	the rue saint-denis was as mute as the avenue of the sphinxes in thebesnumber there wasn ’ t a living soul at the junction , which was turning white in reflected sunlight
1	all they found in it was a piece of paper , folded
1	can it be true , then ?
1	on this bench , which was lit by several candles , there was a man between two gendarmes
1	was it really you who killed the gunner sergeant ?
1	the orchard was taken , though
1	bringing up the rear came an old man in the clothes of a labourer , limping
1	but , according to the etymology of the word , explaining can also mean letting the scene , or attitude or expression , unfold the fullness nestled in its simple presence
1	it was then that he noticed she was in tears
1	here i am , he said
1	they forced the burghers to lend a hand
1	and how could it occur to them , they who imagined that louis xvii reigned on the ninth of thermidornumber and that louis xviii reigned on the day marengo took place ?
1	it serves those who denounce it without complaining , even exonerating them , and its magnanimity lies in agreeing to desertion
1	to throw herself into that very death just as she would have thrown herself into any other , and drag marius in , too
1	you ’ re not talking , marius shot back , about that miserable petty theft of forty years ago , expiated , as appears from your very own newspapers , by a whole lifetime of repentance , self-denial , and good ?
1	you write it yourself
1	he was supposed to occupy courfeyrac ’ s chambers , which were decent and where a certain number of law books , bolstered and filled out by odd volumes of novels , made up the library required by the regulations
1	jean valjean took the risk of sticking his nose out to look round the corner into the street
1	you ’ ll get yourself robbed , ma bougon used to say
1	the prioress , usually dammed up by silence , and now having a surplus in her reservoir , stood and shouted with the loquacity of an opened sluice gate : on my right , i have benedict and on my left , bernard
1	his mind was elsewhere and where your mind is , your eyes follow
1	you would have said it was the tatters of a whole populace , rags made of wood , iron , bronze , stone that the faubourg saint-antoine had shovelled there at its doorstep with one colossal sweep of the broom , turning its misery into a barricade
1	what are you going to do ?
1	she could hardly lift the bucket
1	this is a profound and useful truth to know , one the stuarts did not have an inkling of in number and the bourbons did not have a clue about even in number
1	at the corner of the rue de bourdonnais there were no more lanterns
1	you need the useless for happiness
1	there were instantly several versions of the story , which had wound up being described as a case of child-snatching
1	now there ’ s a good book for you , said monsieur gillenormand
1	they had not been able to figure it out
1	you think this poor unfortunate convict has only a sou to his name ; not so , he has liberty
1	how do you work that out ?
1	not long after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the top plank , jean valjean felt himself being carted out , then rolling along
1	and so he came to the prefecture , followed by the seminary
1	the interior , calm again , is strange
1	wouldn ’ t that be something if i left my daughter without a stitch !
1	so just what was it ?
1	it was clear that whoever was in charge of this sordid procession had not bothered to sort them
1	long billowing curtains hung at the casement windows in great broken folds that were truly magnificent
1	'looking is not the same as experiencing ' , isabelle adjani reckons and she would know when it comes to looks
1	when he spoke , she listened , and when he took action , she was right behind him
1	the tradition of cars of masks—masked revellers—goes back as far as the earliest years of the monarchy
1	he could not help but give a start of surprise that did not escape jondrette
1	it is a matter of the twin mastery the camera prompts , the mastery of the operator and that of his subject ’
1	this figure probably includes all the other corpses that were thrown into the ravine the day after the fighting
1	listen , she said , you ’ re wrong
1	clearly he is not on the right track ; he stops to get his bearings
1	listen to me , friend
1	it was , indeed , him
1	as you like , father , said cosette
1	he was familiar with its tradition as though he had been a witness to it
1	now our two bedrooms , which used to be covered with old wallpaper whitewashed with lime , would not be out of place in a château as fine as your own
1	fantine had had a night of fever and insomnia—full of happy images , though ; in the morning , she fell asleep
1	trophonius ’ s vat holds nothing not found in mesmer ’ s tub ; ergaphilas is resurrected in cagliostro ; the brahmin vasaphanta is incarnated in the comte de saint-germain ; saint-médard cemetery supplies miracles every bit as good as those of the umumiya mosque of damascus
1	chance would have it that the heads of their beds leaned against the chimney flue
1	cosette gave nothing away
1	next to the french doors , a great big table with an inkstand , piled high with papers all in a heap and enormous tomes
1	the first , feeling himself to be the weaker , avoided the second , but he avoided him in a profoundly furious fashion ; anyone observing him closely would have seen his eyes shining with the glum hostility of a man in flight and with all the menace there is in fear
1	the moon shone right on jean valjean ’ s wildly frightened face
1	i thought it was just a fling , but it looks like it ’ s real passion
1	but if all the taunting passivity of the peasant is packed into that expression , all the freethinking anarchy of the cheeky suburban nipper is packed , indubitably , into this other
1	and she told herself that an intervention of angels , some celestial chance , had restored him to her
1	and they burst out laughing
1	from the shard it completes the amphora , the pitcher
1	he had a knack for expressing great things in the most common idioms
1	bad does not come from man , who is , at bottom , good
1	which of them do you claim to represent ?
1	faced with the interviewer who wants to hear the old men and women reminiscing about the days of the soviet union , an old peasant woman digs her heels in and keeps repeating something no one is asking her to say , a thing she never stops saying without ever getting a reply , the only thing she 's interested in : having her own little corner with a window
1	he jammed his hat down resolutely and left
1	among other things , this same passerby said :
1	she had never heard the word uttered in its earthly sense
1	now , war , civilized war , sums up and exhausts all forms of banditry , from the armed robbery of the catalan bands in the gorges of mount jaxa to the marauding of the comanche indians in doubtful pass
1	why did he have to die , the idiot ?
1	this blindman ’ s buff–style musketry went on for a good fifteen minutes and killed several panes of glass
1	gavroche merely answered : you baby !
1	it is as though they bounded through life to get it over with faster
1	this , monsieur le baron
1	at the same time , he became twice as unsociable
1	hear , hear , said théodule
1	the sun looks like a pauper
1	éponine and azelma had spent hours contemplating it and cosette herself , furtively it is true , had dared to cast a glance at it
1	everyone knows voltaire ’ s name and no one knows the name of caesar de bus
1	the mystical school of joseph de maistre , number which , at the time , spiced up what were known as the ultra—ultra-royalist—newspapersnumber with highfalutin cosmogony , would not have failed to claim javert as a symbol
1	gavroche went on , adding with dignity : there are three of us
1	a few stars , feebly punctuating the pale blue of the zenith and visible only to daydreamers , made barely perceptible points of splendour in the infinite vastness
1	from the central committee
1	when monsieur gillenormand lived in the rue servandoni , he haunted several very good and very noble salons
1	it ’ s the good lord who ’ s guided me to your inn
1	old man thénardier was one of those men who judge a situation at a glance
1	after all , if anyone has come to grief , it ’ s not my fault
1	does anyone , cried feuilly bitterly , understand these men—and he rattled off names , well-known names , even famous names , some from the old armynumber—who promised to come and join us , who swore they would help us , and who were bound to do so in all honour , these men who were to have been our generals and who have deserted us !
1	this was fauchelevent , jean valjean , and cosette
1	as for the strong emotion he experienced shortly after being back under the turf roof of his road-mender ’ s hut again , this was it :
1	the fireplace and the table with the two chairs sat exactly facing marius
1	mabeuf , the churchwarden , whom he went to see again , had given him an account of life in vernon , the colonel ’ s retirement , his flowers , his loneliness
1	cosette has placed a big old bergère covered in utrecht velvet by your bed and she said to it : open your arms to him
1	monseigneur bienvenu had what is commonly known as a handsome head , but he was so sweet that you forgot he was handsome
1	for science made government , for the force of things become the sole public force , for the law of nature having its own sanctions and penalties within itself and being promulgated by evidence , for a dawning of truth that corresponds to the dawning of day
1	around number , he invariably spent two afternoons a week in a house in his neighbourhood , rue férou , at madame la baronne de t—— , number a worthy and respectable eminence whose husband had been ambassador of france in berlin under louis xvi
1	he ’ s as white as a plucked chicken
1	marius sat down and gestured for him to sit
1	it ’ s her mother that entrusted her to me , i can only hand her over to her mother
1	now , we will say in all conscience , louis-philippe being in good faith in his tenure , and democracy being in good faith in its assault , the degree of horror that attaches to the social struggles can not be charged either to the king or to the democracy
1	i was wondering when you ’ d get to it
1	surely this small enclosure , with the sky as a ceiling , was enough to enable him to worship god by regarding his loveliest works and his most sublime works , one by one ?
1	a thief , since he robbed a rich manufacturer , monsieur madeleine , whose ruin he caused
1	monsieur leblanc said nothing
1	its metaphors are sometimes so shameless you can feel they have been in shackles
1	and what did it mean ?
1	the result was the whiteness we mentioned , a whiteness that bathed even her lips and eyes in its radiance
1	this was more than monsieur gillenormand could bear to hear
1	and now , at the very moment he was about to deliver a brigand , in the middle of perpetrating a crime , to the legal authorities , destiny screamed at him : but it ’ s thénardier !
1	marius reached the church , but did not go in ; instead he turned and went behind the chevet
1	i do : i ’ m thrilled !
1	the old man addressed did not stir
1	jean valjean ’ s wound had been a diversion
1	the poor mother hung her head
1	the same artery was throbbing everywhere
1	he watched in alarm as the kind of frightening calm that the injustice of his rotten fate had produced melted away inside him
1	on top of the national guard
1	vvhat can you say about the 'talkies ' and about the sound-track that pu ts the finishing touches on the effect of mastery of th , e image track , except that they are a lot more harmful than people realize ?
1	then he pushed the dead body away with his foot and said : throw that outside
1	he was so bedazzled that everything else had been wiped from his brain
1	he would have died at thermopylae with leonidas and would have burned drogheda with cromwellnumber
1	or you ’ ll have to deal with cosette
1	it was a white paper envelope
1	you are so beautiful !
1	sometimes , while getting the little girl to spell , he remembered that it was with the idea of doing wrong in mind that he had learned to read in jail
1	is what we see a country without a history , men without a fate or unequal to their fate ?
1	and then the illness got worse and a nurse was needed
1	the hand that had gripped him from behind just as he was about to fall and which he had felt as he lost consciousness was jean valjean ’ s
1	the post book has it down as five and a quarter leagues
1	you ’ ll be staying with us at least this week ?
1	it made you think of a hungry predator following its prey , but trying to look as though it wasn ’ t
1	jean valjean took a step toward her
1	it was located in the ruelle du boulanger
1	me , save your life !
1	to have cosette , to possess cosette , was no different for him from breathing
1	gibelotte recognized joly and laigle and plunked a bottle of wine on the table
1	this voice was not entirely unfamiliar to him
1	marius was there from now on to carry out the job of providence by cosette ’ s side
1	as for that , said toussaint , it ’ s the honest truth
1	anyone passing through the small town of vernonnumber in those days and taking a stroll over the beautiful monumental bridge that will soon be replaced , let ’ s hope , by some hideous wrought-iron affair , would have been able to see , if they looked down from the parapet , a man of about fifty wearing a leather cap and dressed in trousers and a jacket of coarse grey woolen cloth , to which something yellow was sewn which had once been a red ribbon , shod in clogs , weathered by the sun , his face almost black and his hair almost white , with a large scar across his forehead that ran on down his cheek , bent , buckled , old before his time , strolling around virtually all day , with a spade or a billhook in hand , inside one of those walled plots of land right next to the bridge that line the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces—lovely enclosures full of flowers that you would describe as gardens if they were a lot bigger , and , if they were a lot smaller , as bouquets
1	a few constellations here and there in the pale , deep sky , the earth all black , the sky all white , a shiver rippling through the blades of grass , everywhere the mysterious rush and sudden chill of dawn light
1	when he was nabbed again , the new severities inflicted on him only served to make him wilder
1	you said to yourself : damn it !
1	woe to anyone who happened to be within arm ’ s reach then !
1	but he never went to these parties or balls except on days when it was cold and dry enough to split stone , for he could not afford a cab and he did not want to turn up unless his boots were polished to a mirror finish by the frost
1	they found themselves exactly below thénardier
1	mademoiselle , i am entirely on your side , i want girls to marry , they ’ re made for it
1	all of a sudden , with one of those birdlike movements of his , he took the letter
1	at times she would become serious and would study her little black dress
1	they have two mothers , both stepmothers : ignorance and misery
1	it ’ s because they have a nest that they are able to sing
1	she let her head fall on marius ’ s knees and her eyelids closed
1	marius took no notice of these symptoms
1	what about you , monsieur le vétéran , you must have been wounded quite a bit ?
1	napoléon came into his own as the ogre of corsica there ; later on , the entry into history of monsieur le marquis buonaparté , lieutenant general of the king ’ s armies , was a concession to the spirit of the age
1	as we never get tired of repeating , think , first and foremost , of the disinherited and hurting hordes , relieve them , give them air , give them light , love them , broaden their horizon magnificently , lavish all kinds of education on them , set them the example of toil , never the example of idleness , lighten the weight of the individual burden by giving more weight to the notion of the universal goal , limit poverty without limiting wealth , create vast fields of activity , public and popular , be like briareus and have a hundred hands that can reach out on all sides to the downtrodden and the weak , put collective power to work at that great duty , which is to open workshops to all hands , schools to all aptitudes , and laboratories to all forms of intelligence , increase wages , decrease the struggle , balance debits and credits , that is , match pleasure to effort and gratification to need—in a word , make the social apparatus release more light and more comfort , for the benefit of the suffering and the ignorant
1	fauchelevent felt completely secure
1	monsieur de conzié , number who was bishop in ’ number , had a big reception room built there
1	sister simplice was white , with a waxy whiteness
1	she let him do this in silence
1	the gamin loves the city , he also loves solitude , having something of the sage in him
1	one of the most uncontested forms of salvation of nineteenth-century society set itself up in france and on the continent
1	he ambled along for some time with his head hung low
1	god was as visible in this enterprise as jean valjean
1	she placed her hand on the door handle
1	this question , straightforward for cosette , was profoundly complex for jean valjean
1	he ’ s one of the wounded , said jean valjean
1	a ship of the line is composed of both the heaviest and the lightest of materials , because it is tied to three forms of substance at once , solid , liquid , and gas , and has to fight against all three
1	this convent that , in number , had already existed for many long years in the petite rue picpus was a community of bernardines of the rule of martin verganumber
1	he gazed at the wall , then he gazed at himself , marvelling that it was this particular chamber and that it was he , himself
1	where does it spring from ?
1	as for the man , he had only one thought : how to get rich quick
1	of all the children with fathers and mothers , he was one of those who most deserve pity , for they are actually orphans
1	jean valjean had continued on his course once more and did not stop again
1	he replaced jean valjean who , because he still had his arm in that sling , could not give the bride his hand
1	he did not suffer by being in this situation and he did not blame anybody
1	we will have no further occasion to speak of monsieur félix tholomyès
1	nothing was known about her except that she was mad and that in the world she had been given up for dead
1	her feet were bare
1	the past came back to him in a showdown with the present ; he compared and he sobbed
1	we should go and have a look
1	what happens to the world of silence once the first son et lumiere productions are staged , again under the aegis of l\alraux , invading
1	and that ’ s also how i know him
1	ten o ’ clock came and went
1	a story , une histoire , is an arrangement of actions according to which there has not simply been this and then that , but a configuration that fits the facts together and allows them to be presented as a whole : what aristotle calls a muthos – a storyline , or plot , in the sense in which we speak of the plot of a play
1	it might well have prevented the marriage
1	true , cried joly , chiming in
1	there was a lull
1	we should not forget , in fact , that wherever there is only cleverness , there is necessarily pettiness
1	she let out a feeble cry
1	marius got as close as he could while pretending to be reading his book , but he remained a long way off again , then he returned to plop himself down on his bench , where he spent four hours watching frank little sparrows hopping about on the path , seemingly poking fun at him
1	old men need affection like the sun
1	one day tholomyès took the other three aside , made an oracular gesture , and said to them : it ’ s nearly a year since fantine , dahlia , zéphine , and favourite have been asking us for a surprise
1	he got to his feet and began pacing again
1	the marquis de champtercier happened to be there—a rich old skinflint who had found a way to be an ultra-royalist and an ultra-voltairean at once , number though at the time he was not alone in such a feat
1	fantine acquired this sublime skill and with it got back a bit of her old courage
1	monsieur , i ’ m not heartless
1	basque and nicolette , flabbergasted , had been riveted by their young master all covered in blood
1	sometimes you admire him
1	a kitchen is a laboratory , a dancer is a professor , an acrobat is a gymnast , a boxer is a pugilist , an apothecary is a chemist , a wigmaker is an artiste , a plasterer ’ s helper is an architect , a jockey is a sportsman , a woodlouse is a pterygobranchiate
1	the iron bands crossed it without a gap
1	he trusted himself to god just as she trusted herself to him
1	a barricade , it ’ s child ’ s play
1	but what about you !
1	we have copied down the exchange between them as best we could
1	there was enough wind to raise little riots of dust here and there
1	madame albertine normally attended sermons and services in a state of profound calm and complete immobility
1	that is the place for jet …
1	a cannon was fired and that night the men on patrol found him hiding under the keel of a boat that was being built
1	we never refuse travellers anything
1	mother thénardier threw him a scornful look
1	it was her delight and her vanity to trot out those two names at every opportunity
1	they don ’ t much like that visit , these good ladies
1	it made him angry
1	thénardier was right , this detail was accurate , though it had escaped marius in his distress
1	rome smells worse under vitellius than under sullanumber under claudius and under domitiannumber there is a deformed baseness corresponding to the ugliness of the tyrant
1	this post was occupied by national guards from the suburbs
1	in a wall next to the archway , another door with key-stones dating from the days of henri ivnumber opens to allow a glimpse of trees in an orchard
1	the father , well , he would stand behind that pillar so he couldn ’ t be seen
1	he was still pacing to and fro
1	you feel a sort of jolt , everything is black , you make out a dim doorway , that sombre horse of life that was dragging you along stops and you see someone veiled and unknown unharness it in the shadows
1	mothers ’ arms are made for tenderness ; children sleep deeply in them
1	if you don ’ t send forty francs before the end of a week , the little one will be dead
1	it is true that the end of the embankment was hidden from sight by a heap of rubble six or seven feet high produced by some demolition or other
1	at that moment , the pistol shot was heard
1	lying next to her on the floor , wide open , was a volume of the same format as the other one and probably of the same novel
1	but the shovel and pickaxe had been a flash of light for boulatruelle ; he ran off into the bushes the next morning , but he didn ’ t find either the shovel or the pickaxe
1	we ’ d see each other from first thing in the morning
1	marius heard the bourgeois out , then circled the pond one more time
1	for how long a stretch ?
1	you look at a star for two reasons , because it is bright and because it is impenetrable
1	bigrenaille grabbed a pistol that he kept hidden in his smock and put it in thénardier ’ s hand , whispering in his ear : it ’ s javert
1	your shirts are hangin ’ out
1	this is wittier , but less grand ; something like racine after corneille , like euripides after aeschylus
1	aren ’ t you forgetting i ’ m chucking cosette out today ?
1	french national ethics committee , by way of conclusion
1	while rocking her two children , the mother tunelessly crooned a romantic ballad then all the rage :
1	if you want to understand what revolution is , call it progress ; and if you want to understand what progress is , call it tomorrow
1	today , when the audio-visible of the mass media reigns , beamed out twenty-four hours a day seven days a week , what remains of that effect of imlzediacy of visual representation ?
1	the squealers haven ’ t spotted it
1	at bottom , if the truth be known , he ’ d have preferred not to go to arras
1	happy , even in his anguish , is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of calamity !
1	we will say here only that , twenty years later , under king louis-philippe , number he was a fat provincial attorney , influential and rich , a shrewd voter and a most severe jurist ; and still a man of pleasure
1	her final resting place was just like her bed
1	monsieur tranchelevent , i have the honour of asking you on behalf of my grandson , the baron marius pontmercy , for mademoiselle ’ s hand
1	this contemplation was fatal to him
1	yes , my child , said mother thenardier
1	anyone sleeping inside wakes up
1	monsieur gillenormand took his seat
1	you have there a rent of nine thousand francs a year
1	what was going on inside him , no one could have said , yet anyone could understand
1	had a pin that i pricked myself on
1	the boy went back inside the hut
1	but he only attended one sitting and three or four special conferences
1	he saw opposite him , in the slanting mirror on top of the sideboard , these four lines which he could distinctly read :
1	and she went on : this is what i call being good : being nice , coming here to live , resuming our nice little promenades , there are birds here just like in the rue plumet ; living with us , leaving that hole of a place in the rue de l ’ homme-armé , not putting on charades for us to work out , being like everyone else , having dinner with us , having breakfast with us , being my father
1	these cars , or , to be more precise , these cartloads of masks , are only too familiar to parisians
1	you could hear the clatter of the swords in the carrousel of all those amazing soldiers of the mighty republic and the mighty empire ; there was a glut of heroes tripping over themselves at napoléon ’ s door—men from the rhine , from the scheldt , the adige , and the nile ; companions of joubert , desaix , marceau , hoche , kléber ; balloonists from fleurus , grenadiers from mayence , pontoniers from genoa , hussars that the pyramids had gazed upon , artillerymen junot ’ s cannonballs had spattered , cuirassiers who had stormed the battle fleet at anchor in the zuyder zee ; some had followed bonaparte over the bridge at lodi , others had been with murat in the trenches of mantua , still others had gone before lannes in the sunken road of montebello
1	that ’ s how suffering improvises on old age !
1	thus speaks that approximation of wisdom with which the bourgeoisie , that approximation of the people , contents itself so readily
1	there was no longer a soul anywhere on the street
1	underneath society there is , and we must insist , until the day ignorance is dispelled , there always will be , the great cavern of evil
1	you ’ re wearing your lungs out , you poor old brute , you worry me , you ’ re wasting your breath
1	his twenty-three wounds touch me less than the gob of spit on jesus christ ’ s forehead
1	the river , that ’ s the real cemetery in this town
1	look through the people and you will see the truth
1	who puts the nails in the coffin ?
1	all the places you no longer see , that you will perhaps never see again , though you have hung on to their image , take on a painful loveliness , come back to you with the melancholy of an apparition , make the holy land visible to you , and are , so to speak , the true face of france ; and you love them and you evoke them as they are , as they were , and you cling to them , and you don ’ t want anything to change , for you hold the face of your homeland in your heart as you would your own mother ’ s face
1	what a beautiful thing , cried the wigmaker in a pindaricnumber tone , to die on the field of battle !
1	fauchelevent had not been able to get those words out of his head all night
1	did she see anything ?
1	marius told courfeyrac : i ’ ve come to sleep at your place
1	wait for me the day after tomorrow
1	i ’ ll come to see you and you ’ ll look at it
1	how did he get there ?
1	only , she did not doubt that he had come back to get her
1	his hands clench and curl up and grasp at nothingness
1	there ought to be saint-cloud netsnumber for the public wealth
1	but i , said the host , i don ’ t have a room
1	predestined paths are not all straight ; they don ’ t evolve into a rectilinear avenue in front of the predestined ; they have their blind alley ’ s , obscure twists and turns , disturbing crossroads offering alternative paths
1	it was covered in material from when it was a hospital
1	all was peace and silence ; no one was on the causeway ; on the verges , a few scattered workingmen , barely glimpsed , were going off to work
1	that is the language spoken in france , for example , for more than four centuries now , not only by a form of misery , but by misery itself , all the possible human misery in the world
1	this was the second white apparition he had encountered : the bishop had caused virtue to dawn on his horizon ; cosette brought the dawning of love
1	ah , i recognize him , all right !
1	see , sister , this doll is more fun than the other one
1	you may sit down , said the judge
1	what was he to do ?
1	the farther away he got from the palais-royal , the fewer lights there were in windows ; the boutiques were completely closed , no one was chatting on their doorsteps , the street grew darker and at the same time the crowd grew denser
1	i tell you i never stole and that i am old man champmathieu
1	he was never quick to condemn and he always took into account the surrounding circumstances
1	see what comes next , looming over us as it is : an officially terrorist art preaching suicide and self- mutilation - thereby extending the current infatua- tion with scarring and piercing
1	number , petite rue picpus
1	wathier ’ s column alone had been cobbled by the disaster ; delord ’ s column , which ney had sent veering off to the left as though he had divined the trap , had arrived intact
1	he could only dimly now hear above him , like a faint murmur , the awful tumult of the tavern being stormed
1	it was absolutely necessary to absorb the shock of the fire
1	there is nothing he could not grow into
1	its laugh is the mouth of a volcano that spatters the whole world
1	he would gladly have said hombre , like the spanish
1	what are the causes of these disasters ?
1	a story from before the war
1	you might as well kill two birds with the one stone , he said
1	where does it hurt ?
1	grantaire , as a true satellite of enjolras , dwelt in this circle of young men ; he lived there , he was only happy there , he followed them everywhere
1	we have already seen something of his history
1	o luxembourg , o georgics of the rue madame and of the allée de l ’ observatoire ! number o dreamy chickadiddies !
1	be justly so today
1	the cannon , without making a passable breach , had put a real dent in the middle of the redoubt ; there , the top of the wall had been hit by cannonballs and had crumbled ; and the rubble that had fallen , inside and outside , had piled up to create two sorts of taluses on either side of the roadblock , one inside , the other outside
1	or on trinity sunday
1	all montreuil-sur-mer was abuzz with the rumour
1	the age was mightily mocked , which exempted a person from trying to understand it
1	the old woman realized with horror that it was a one-thousand-franc note
1	calling a meeting at the place du panthéon !
1	what won ’ t we do to be cured ?
1	she was held in custody , but they had no proof against the man
1	enjolras had not fallen into the trap ; the barricade did not retaliate
1	some rushed to embrace it with enthusiasm and joy , others turned their backs on it , each according to their nature
1	on both sides , women flailed about madly ; the waves for one lot , the pit for the others ; there , they drowned , here , they were buried alive
1	in efremov too , like anywhere else , people analyse their fate , and whether it is just or unjust ; they analyse the part they played in their own fate and the part fate played without their help
1	the swarm of onlookers , jumping for joy , followed behind , slinging taunts
1	he turned his head and saw a young savoyard , number an itinerant chimney sweep , of about twelve skipping along the path singing , a hurdy-gurdy , or vielle , at his side and a cherrywood box on his back ; he was one of those chirpy little strays that roam the countryside , with their knees peeping through the holes in their trousers
1	he wanted them to fill hearts and minds with principles extrapolated into general ideas ; he said , revolution , yes , but not without civilization ; and all around the mountain peak he opened up the vast blue horizon
1	a tiny handful of embers was smoking away sadly
1	jondrette exclaimed : an old master , a very valuable picture , my benefactor !
1	first , the direct creation of words
1	it ’ s a woman , then ?
1	it was he who said : cardinals are the roman peers of france ; lords are the english peers of france
1	you know , he got me to sign a letter to get her away from the thénardiers
1	he was forced to acknowledge that goodness existed
1	the asturian peasants are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one pup who is killed by the mother because otherwise it would grow up to devour all the other pups
1	this ruling handed down , he drank and resumed : i agree to live
1	economically , the situation can be summed up like this : paris is a leaky bucket
1	guffawed a carter who was listening
1	respect , a respect beyond words , spread through you by degrees and made its way to your heart and you couldn ’ t help but feel that you were in the presence of one of those great spirits , tried and tested and full of compassion , whose thinking is on such a large scale that it can ’ t be anything but gentle
1	since he lacked a mother , he meditated on the motherland
1	he was as shiny as a pin
1	as the place is worth seeing , nobody goes there
1	i warn you that my grandfather goes one better still , he says buonaparté
1	each sister took a turn kneeling on the stone floor and confessing out loud , before all , the faults and sins she had committed that week
1	brujon , who was a bit of an oracle and who had , as we know , set the job up , had still not spoken
1	he is somewhere between seven and thirteen years of age , lives in packs , wears his feet out walking , sleeps in the open , wears an old pair of trousers of his father ’ s that come down over his heels , an old hat from some other father that comes down over his ears , a single brace with yellowing edges ; he runs around , on the lookout , on the take , killing time ; primes pipes , swears like one of the damned , haunts cabarets , knows thieves , is on intimate terms with the streetwalkers , talks slang , sings dirty ditties , and hasn ’ t got a nasty bone in his body
1	vulgarity is an old narcissus who adores himself and applauds the common vulgarity
1	these names have faces
1	he could never manage to pronounce the ds
1	it is one of the notes written in his own hand that he left behind
1	it was obvious providence had a hand in this
1	the very recent development of real- time computer imagery only ever accentuates this effect of iconic stupefaction
1	javert got to his feet the moment the courier handed him the order for the arrest and the summons
1	sooner or later the magnificent matter of universal education will come up with the irresistible authority of absolute truth ; and when it does , those that rule under the watchful eye of the french ideal of enlightenment will have to make the following choice : the children of france or the street urchins of paris ; flames in the light of day or will-o ’ -the-wisps in the dark
1	toussaint , cosette went on , you are careful to barricade the shutters properly with bars at night , aren ’ t you ? —at least on the garden side ?
1	one was out in front , the other , some distance behind
1	we should add that the rain kept this sentry blockaded in his sentry box
1	this brought her back to her senses so that she could see the things around her for what they really were
1	such piddling coincidences always complicate domestic dramas
1	and that is the great danger for those who run when france wants only to walk , or who walk when france wants to stop for a breather
1	mademoiselle baptistine , perfectly peaceful and natural , took her place at his left
1	you ducked under ’ im ,
1	what are you going to do after that ?
1	to you my dearly beloved , to you my children , to you my innocents !
1	fancy wanting me to swear !
1	his film shows us neither shelling nor damage
1	his wife died there of the chest infection she ’ d had for ages
1	one day this exchange occurred in his hearing : what was the editor of the courrier françaisnumber sentenced to ?
1	the soul will gravitate around the truth , just as the star does around the light
1	it is the province of pain to bring out the childish side of a man
1	she ripped it out of his hand
1	said one of the gendarmes
1	though she lived at a time when women did not yet have souls , she had a soul ; a soul tinged pink and purple , hotter than fire , fresher than the dawn
1	monsieur , mother magnon would say to him , don ’ t they take after you !
1	there are men who work hard , digging for gold ; he worked hard , digging for pity
1	i know this one is an organic disease and fairly well advanced , but it ’ s all such a mystery , all that !
1	a certain oscillation was shaking up all the horizons of his brain
1	at the same time , he saw a pale girl standing in front of him
1	marius stared at him , amazed
1	they greeted with transports of joy vulgar songs in which napoléon was nicknamed nicolas
1	and he was not talking about turner 's rain , steam and speed ( the great western railway ) , the painting that paved the way for monet 's impressionism
1	i ’ m as happy as ever
1	the man was not from around there
1	in ’ number , a boilermaker bought the house to demolish it , but since he couldn ’ t pay the asking price , the nation sent him into bankruptcy
1	because everything has to be done tomorrow !
1	why didn ’ t you take them with the cutlery ?
1	he answered rather awkwardly : ah !
1	this is the rue plâtrière , now called the rue jean-jacques rousseau because of an odd couple that lived here about sixty years ago
1	the land was invaded and i defended it ; france was threatened , i offered my breast
1	maman , the elder boy went on , is a lady who lives with mamselle miss
1	this opening was grim and such a tiny window on the world brought him more cold than heat , more darkness than daylight
1	a theatre poster turned up , emblazoned with the title of a tragedy from the old , so-called classical , repertoire
1	said basque , drawing himself up
1	he is presumed to have got stuck under the piles of the arsenal pier
1	but first things first
1	was he to quietly worm his way into cosette ’ s house ?
1	don ’ t lose sight of the front door for a second , and if you see anything at all , i want you back here on the double !
1	the looks women throw out are like the moving parts of certain machines that look innocuous enough but are deadly
1	and so the wedding took place on the sixteenth , notwithstanding the public festivities
1	what is he doing ?
1	it took him only a second to open it , hop onto the sill and step over
1	the old saying goes that it 's always in some remote place far away that the fate of the folks here is decided , a place way over yonder where no one answers guilty ’
1	it is likely that when the bandits were rifling through the prisoner ’ s pockets , he had this retooled sou on him and managed to hide it in his hand , and that afterwards , with his right hand free , he managed to unscrew it and used the saw to cut through the ropes tying him
1	this is a bad moment to utter the word love
1	and in these two places , so similar and yet so different , these two species of being , so very different , accomplished the same duty , atonement
1	it seemed to him that everything had evaporated
1	something like this vision appeared no doubt in the old orphic sagasnumber telling of centaurs , antique hippanthropes , those titans with human faces and equine chests who scaled olympus gambolling , horrible creatures , invulnerable , sublime ; gods and beasts , both
1	he keeps up appearances , it ’ s true , but i sense the straits he ’ s in
1	this is the way men turn into angels
1	they tied one end of the rope brujon had woven in his dungeon to the stumps of the chimney bars they had just twisted off , threw the other end over the encircling wall , leaped over the chasm in a single bound , hung on tight to the top of the wall , clambered over it , let themselves slide , one at a time , down the rope onto a little roof that abutted the bathhouse , pulled in their rope , jumped down into the bathhouse courtyard , crossed it , pushed open the porter ’ s transom , next to which hung his cord , pulled the cord , opened the porte cochère , and found themselves in the street
1	now , he had just looked down into a vipers ’ hole ; it was a nest of monsters and it was right under his nose
1	why not take advantage of the fact that you ’ re rich ?
1	with guns like this one , all you have to do is exceed the ratio of ten parts tin to a hundred copper , even by a fraction , and they are liable to burst
1	was it partly their own fault ?
1	monsieur le président , the presiding judge , snuck in this back way so that even those who might have spied on him and followed him and observed that every day monsieur le président went off somewhere mysteriously , could not have suspected that going off to the rue de babylone actually meant going off to the rue blomet
1	on the right , as you enter by the dining room
1	she slowly backed away , for she felt herself drawn
1	but this lasted only a moment
1	those two little creatures were so obviously happy !
1	the church struck a quarter past three
1	as for the little girl , i need to talk that over a bit with monsieur
1	did anyone see him come out ?
1	this is how the dialogue went :
1	monsieur madeleine ended up becoming aware of this , but it seemed beneath his notice
1	eight feet above the floor , a massive beam went from one end of this underground passage to the other ; from this beam , at regular intervals , hung chains three feet long , and on the end of these chains were collar shackles
1	until now all that had been hanging over him had been , in his eyes , a clean , simple , limpid surface ; nothing unknown or obscure there ; nothing that wasn ’ t defined , coordinated , linked , precise , exact , circumscribed , limited , closed ; completely foreseen
1	i miss the bride ’ s garter
1	le dab est sinve , la dabuge est merloussière , la fée est bative , the old man ’ s thick , the old lady ’ s slippery , the sprite ’ s easy on the eye—the bourgeois gentleman is stupid , his lady wife is cunning , the daughter is pretty
1	add to that little boots with little iron caps on the heels , a narrow-brimmed top hat , hair worn in a tuft , an enormous cane , and conversation spiced with the puns of potier
1	the place was completely isolated
1	then he strode twice , slowly and in silence , from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace , crossing the whole length of the room , causing the parquet to creak , like a stone statue on the move
1	he was six feet tall , had pectorals of marble , biceps of bronze , cavernous lungs , the torso of a colossus , and the skull of a bird
1	the bigwigs , the nobs , are at the top , along the pathway where the acacias are , where it ’ s paved
1	then he raised his voice : citizens !
1	a hand emerged from below the pall , dangling toward the floor
1	it was merely a coincidence , perhaps , no doubt , of course , but a threatening coincidence
1	a piece of the north gate , broken by the french , hangs where it has been fixed to the wall
1	he headed for the faubourg saint-marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find the prefect of police
1	get in here this minute !
1	but this is where , and we insist on this , this is where life is , the throbbing , the shuddering of humanity
1	it goes without saying that permission was never granted to men
1	the iron soldier is worth every bit as much as the iron duke
1	on the mantelpeice , under a glass jar , sat a woman ’ s headdress worked with silver thread and orange blossomnumber
1	i ’ ll be here at six o ’ clock , and i ’ ll bring you the sixty francs
1	i did , said madeleine
1	through cracks in the planks he glimpsed the mounds of rubble and roughly cemented stones that passersby could still see there ten years ago
1	the innkeeper started following him again
1	thénardier did perhaps know something
1	you can take off with four l ’ s , jean prouvaire told him
1	naturally , he did not see the girl he was looking for
1	he picked up the flag which had fallen right at his feet
1	with nihilism no discussion is possible
1	put your shawl on
1	apart from the visible signs we ’ ve mentioned , the prosperity father madeleine had created in montreuil-sur-mer had another symptom that , though not visible , was no less significant
1	jean valjean froze , aghast
1	he did not look for him , he saw him at once
1	he pulled the curtains back a little and by the light of the rushlight he saw fantine ’ s great calm eyes watching him
1	it happens because it has to happen
1	i think that would be best , replied marius coldly
1	he had thought of nothing else from the moment the conversation began , but for some reason hadn ’ t dared bring the subject up
1	he was happy , joyful , thrilled , charming , young
1	the nipper had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus
1	is there anything you need ?
1	marius , still fighting , was so peppered with wounds , particularly to the head , that his face was lost in blood and looked for all the world as though it was covered in a red handkerchief
1	at nightfall they used to light lamps placed on posts at regular intervals and these lamps were lifted and lowered by means of a rope that ran from one end of the street to the other and that fitted inside the groove of the lamppost
1	they seemed almost to have gone out and then , at times , they lit up again and shone like stars
1	don ’ t i also owe something to this woman by way of reparation for the harm i ’ ve done her ?
1	it was only perfectly natural that marius admire her , adoring her as he did
1	if i take myself off , everything will die
1	don ’ t hold it against us
1	it was the sole debt that the colonel had left to him and marius considered it a point of honour that he should pay it
1	the cartridges of the men besieged were running out ; not so , their acid wit
1	fauchelevent had reached the point where you no longer have a clue what you are saying
1	he was in the habit of disappearing like this
1	don ’ t be too long , murmured fantine
1	he said : do you love me ?
1	what the meaning of this is , is that you dropped your pass out of your pocket and i found it on the ground after you ’ d gone
1	on his rounds , he was giving and gentle and he didn ’ t preach so much as chat
1	the object of resentment , nietzsche tells us , is time itself , the es war : this was
1	you couldn ’ t imagine anything simpler than the bishop ’ s bedroom
1	it was only a good fifteen minutes later that he saw that the young man had , indeed , tagged along behind
1	she needs expensive drugs
1	at the foot of this tree , there was a burning fire where three hares were roasting a hunter on a spit and in the background , over another fire , a smoking pot from which the head of a dog poked out
1	he was a bit gouty and when he slept his old fingers , stiff with rheumatism , clutched at the sheets
1	two servants , called matelotte , fish stew , and gibelotte , rabbit stew , whose real names no one ever knew , helped ma hucheloup deck the tables with the carafes of dark rotgut wine and the various gruels that were served to the hungry in earthenware bowls
1	meanwhile , none of the men seemed to see gavroche , who , while this confabulation was taking place , had gone and sat on one of the fence posts ; he waited a few moments , maybe for his father to look his way , then he put his shoes back on and said : is that it ?
1	i saw the door of a house open and i went in
1	was it because of fantine ?
1	why are you whispering ?
1	was jean valjean , in fact , a chrysalis who would dig his heels in and would go on coming over to visit his butterfly ?
1	all these thoughts swirled around in his brain
1	the chaplains spoke highly of his religious habits
1	in the first place , and this was his main worry , javert had not taken the prisoner , prisoner
1	who was this jean valjean who had seen to cosette ’ s education ?
1	traitors crawled out of the woodwork ; men who had gone over to the enemy the day before a battle did not bother hiding a sou of what they ’ d earned in bribes and strutted about shamelessly in broad daylight full of the cynicism wealth and honours bring ; the deserters of ligny and quatre-bras , number in their unchecked and financially rewarded depravity , paraded their monarchical devotion brazenly , for all to see—forgetting what is written on lavatory walls in england : please adjust your dress before leaving
1	champmathieu won ’ t have it
1	the cuirassiers left the cavalry to return to the infantry or , more accurately , all this formidable throng wrestled with each other without letting go their hold
1	at a dull thump , he guessed they were crossing the pont d ’ austerlitz
1	charitable old bastard , aren ’ t you ?
1	it was a circular arch , not as high as the vault , which got smaller by degrees , and not as wide as the gallery , which got narrower at the same time that the vault got lower
1	besides , gavroche had no idea that on that horrible rainy night when he had offered two little mites the hospitality of his elephant , it was for his own brothers that he had played the part of providence
1	this is without counting the innumerable barricades that went up in twenty other quartiers of paris , in the marais , on the montagne sainte-geneviève ; one , in the rue ménilmontant , even sported a porte cochère that had been torn off its hinges ; another close to the little bridge of the hôtel dieu was made with the coach known as an écossaise , unhitched and upended , only three hundred feet from the prefecture of policenumber
1	i can ’ t remember who it was who recently found that tacitus , too , was a ranter , that nero was a victim , and that one really had to feel sorry for that poor holofernesnumber
1	oh , i ’ m so happy !
1	he doubtless knew that javert was held prisoner there
1	since morning , he had smiled in all his impenetrability
1	what is a mere feather for others will be a rock for you
1	we should say further that , on their side , marius and cosette had been away
1	no other city has enjoyed the kind of domination that sometimes scoffs at those it subjugates
1	and that is because—i suspected as much a long time ago—you ’ re hiding something and you want to keep it hidden
1	marius found it hard to believe that the fauchelevent of the barricade was the same as this fauchelevent of flesh and blood , so gravely seated by cosette ’ s side
1	suddenly everything became clear , and he admitted this : that his place in the galleys was empty , that no matter what he did , it was still waiting for him , that robbing petit-gervais led him straight back there , that the empty place was waiting for him and would pull at him until he was back in it , that this was inevitable and fatal
1	you ’ re carrying a child there who can walk
1	it would give montparnasse a good laugh
1	he did not know arras , the streets were dingy , and he wandered around aimlessly
1	yet , should the sheep ’ s mange cause the shepherd to recoil ?
1	the barricade , now walled in on three streets , in front on the rue de la chanvrerie , to the left on the rue du cygne and the rue de la petite-truanderie , to the right on the rue mondétour , really was now almost impregnable ; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in
1	we told them at home that we ’ d taken the letters to the people and they told us , nothing doing !
1	the old woman beetled off , the old man remained alone
1	you felt disconcerted the first time you set eyes on these two forests flanking those two cavernous holes
1	what a mournful instant it is when society withdraws and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being !
1	thanks to their offshoots and to the underlying network of their contacts , babet , gueulemer , claquesous , and montparnasse ran the general ambush business of the entire département of the seinenumber they performed the coups d ’ état of the underworld on unsuspecting passersby
1	outside that sacred thing , justice , by what right does one form of war scorn another ?
1	a cry went up : it ’ s the voter !
1	the kid went over to this pensive character and began circling around him on tiptoe the way you walk when you ’ re frightened of waking someone up
1	fauchelevent was giving the unexpected gribier the once-over again
1	these cobblestones leave riot only their mud
1	what a fatal coincidence !
1	once more the interior of the jondrette rathole came into view
1	he thought it was better not to attract the father ’ s attention
1	there was in her veins the blood of the bohemian and the adventurer who goes about barefoot
1	if you bend over , your eye becomes lost in a deep brick cylinder filled with a densely layered darkness
1	handling iron when there ’ s ice on the pavement—that ’ s tough
1	he took one of his old shirts out of a wardrobe and tore it up
1	she put the bucket on the ground , stuck her hand in her hair and began to slowly scratch her head , a gesture peculiar to children who are terrified and undecided
1	do you know , monsieur ?
1	the lark was the name that , in the depths of marius ’ s melancholy , had replaced ursula
1	he was overcome , he would have liked to be stunningly handsome , he would have liked to be wearing the cross of the légion d ’ honneur
1	i hope , for the sake of the tale ’ s clarity , we may be allowed to resort to a simple device already used on waterloo
1	he came across several doors but they were closed
1	her heart said nothing
1	o relentless march of human society !
1	now , that ’ s what i call a leap !
1	my very dear friend , monsieur montparnasse , said éponine , please , you ’ re a good boy , don ’ t go in !
1	god , who is always within man , and resistant , he the true conscience , to the false , stopping the spark from going out , ordering the sunbeam to remember the sun , enjoining the soul to recognize the true absolute when faced with the fictitious absolute ; indestructible humanity , the inadmissible human heart , that splendid phenomenon , the most beautiful perhaps of our inner wonders , did javert understand it ?
1	suddenly his dull eyes blazed with a hideous fire , the little man straightened up and became terrifying ; he took a step toward monsieur leblanc and bellowed at him in a thundering voice : but never mind all that !
1	the father was laughing , the toddler was laughing , the mother was smiling
1	both cosette and marius , speechless with anguish , not knowing what to say to death , desperate and trembling , stood before him , cosette giving marius her hand
1	he saw mabeuf fall again , he heard gavroche sing under the grapeshot , he felt the coldness of éponine ’ s forehead against his lips ; enjolras , courfeyrac , jean prouvaire , combeferre , bossuet , grantaire , all his friends rose before him , then evaporated
1	they had swapped as many secrets as they could but that did not get them much further than their names
1	they eat that up
1	should a person make it to some other exit , he would find it blocked off by some other plug or grate
1	it was a serene benevolence , flowing over all people , as we have seen , and sometimes extending even to things
1	i ’ ll come and get you there
1	one night , he was alone in his little room under the eaves
1	you see , monsieur pontmercy , i ’ ve been through a bit in life
1	not on your life
1	and he continued to advance toward her
1	two names anticipated by la fontainenumber the opportunity was too good for the legal fraternity attached to the law courts not to have a good laugh about it , and a parody immediately made the rounds of the galleries of the palais de justice , in somewhat lame verse :
1	the insurgents , all geared up for the imminent attack , had their backs turned
1	the former ss camp warden himself recalls the work song the inmates were made to sing in treblinka
1	aunt gillenormand gave up all attempts and arrived at this profound diagnosis : my father never loved my sister much after her silly mistake
1	the prioress ’ s face , till then worried and dark , became once more serene
1	we ’ ve got so many outlays
1	yet the one with the key parlayed , solely to gain time
1	young girls who have no bread—that ’ s a terrible thing
1	if only i make it to the barricade in time !
1	waving away the brigands who still had their hands on monsieur leblanc , he said : back off a bit and let me have a chat with the gentleman
1	he was still in the same position , his chest doubled over the table , his head lying flat on his arms , surrounded by glasses , tankards , and bottles
1	on the part of the egoists , prejudice , the glumness of a rich education , a growing appetite based on intoxication , the giddiness of a prosperity that deadens , a fear of suffering that , in some people , reaches the point of aversion for those who suffer , an implacable self-satisfaction , the ego so inflated that it blocks out the soul ; on the part of the miserable , covetousness , envy , hate at seeing others having fun , the deep pull of the human animal toward personal gratification , hearts filled with fog , sadness , want , fatalism , ignorance impure and simple
1	just as soon as he could
1	well , it ’ s time for revenge
1	he started to stammer like a madman : true ?
1	the art of the motor - cinematographic , video- computer graphic - has finally torpedoed the lack of motorization of the 'primary arts '
1	this bestowing of speech upon images , upon the whirling rush offilm , meant unwittingly triggering a phenomenon of panic in which the audio-visual would gradually lead to this silence of the lambs whereby the art lover becomes the victim of sound , a hostage of the sonorization of the visible
1	and then , human society had only ever done him harm
1	favourite was the result
1	what a star you are , o youth !
1	a little old priest like me , getting along mumbling poppycock ?
1	did you oil the door hinges so they won ’ t make a noise ?
1	he ate up a fairly large allowance , something like three thousand francs , doing nothing
1	all the same , said jondrette , no harm going round to check
1	and then , without moving a muscle , without shifting her head , she looked all around her with her eyes wide open and an air of joy and she said nothing more
1	to say the clever is the same as saying the mediocre
1	he had the same unflappable preoccupied look
1	the very instant he found himself untied , while javert was busy making out his report , he had taken advantage of the confusion , the clamour , the crowd , the darkness , and of a moment when attention was not fixed on him , to leap out the window
1	a convict was his benefactor !
1	he gave the old chief tenant three francs a month to come and sweep out the rathole and bring him , every morning , a small supply of hot water , a fresh egg , and a little bread roll worth one sou
1	you hear the bell
1	that was the last time
1	some little time later it happened that the seine-et-oisenumber prefecture sent the prefecture of police in paris a notice about the kidnapping of a child , which had taken place , they said , in peculiar circumstances , in the commune of montfermeil
1	he only had three shirts , one on his back , one in his chest of drawers , and the third at the laundry
1	indeed , what was the good of having a nice face and a delectable outfit if you don ’ t show them off ?
1	both of them , one in number , the other in number , made sizeable donations to mother catherine de bar , a benedictine nun called of the blessed sacrament , to found a convent of the order of saint benedict with this pious aim ; number initial permission was granted mother catherine de bar by monsieur de metz , abbé of saint-germain , with the stipulation that no maiden can be admitted unless she brings three hundred livres in board which equals six thousand livres in principal
1	four gossips were jabbering away on a doorstop
1	of a private conversation between four men squatting in a ditch at the barrière du trône roundabout , all that could be gleaned was this :
1	the squares were still holding
1	i am not the lord mayor ,
1	this coincided with a black cloud that promptly hid the sun
1	the secondhand dealer she owed money to for her furniture—some furniture ! —had said to her : if you try to sneak off , i ’ ll have you arrested as a thief
1	they were everywhere—except beneath the throne
1	enjolras , we know , had something of the spartan and the puritan
1	there you go , he said
1	love is life—except when it is death
1	came to see me yesterday in a brocade coat
1	who was it that was fleeing so desperately ?
1	all he knew about these two characters was that they had been appointed by the king , number one to his bishopric , the other to his living , on the same day , which happened to be april number , number when madame magloire took down the paintings to shake the dust off , the bishop had found this detail written in faded ink on a little square of paper yellow with age , stuck behind the portrait of the abbé of grand-champ with four sealing wafers
1	is monsieur in a hurry ?
1	in fact , today , i ’ m just reminded by the weather , louis-philippe could use his royalty at both ends , extend the sceptre end against the people and open up the umbrella end against the skies
1	never had such a vise had him in its grip
1	jean valjean ’ s repeated and dogged attempts to escape are enough to prove how strangely the law worked on the human soul
1	and the proof of that , señoras , is this : give me the wine cask and i ’ ll give you the people
1	she did not go out alone and toussaint , surprised by such an errand , would most certainly have shown the letter to monsieur fauchelevent
1	you could have kept the secret to yourself
1	this idea of napoléon ’ s , scorned by men , had been taken up by god
1	these morning trips were arranged the night before
1	he doesn ’ t eat every day but he goes to a show every night , if he feels like it
1	courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable local of the quartier latin ; he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons
1	everybody else goes downstairs ; you , you ’ ll rip up your bedsheets , you ’ ll tie them together , strip by strip , and make a rope , then you ’ ll go out your window and you ’ ll hang there by this thread over an abyss , and it will be at night , in a storm , in the rain , in a hurricane , and if the rope is too short , you ’ ll only have one way left to get down and that will mean dropping
1	the tenants of that house have latchkeys to get in with at night
1	he ’ s at the age when you become girl-crazy !
1	the whole room was bathed in that mist peculiar to dimly lit places that adds to their horror
1	under the chemise you could make out mud-caked trousers and boots with his toes sticking out
1	now they ’ re killing the dead on me
1	on this sheet of paper he read this line written in capital letters that very morning by the elder of the thénardier girls : the cops are here
1	let 's hear it from those trying to denounce this drift of genetic expressionism , from the inside :
1	javert pulled the door open , entered with fantine in tow , and shut the door behind him , to the great disappointment of the gawking horde who stood on tiptoe , craning their necks at the grimy guardroom window in an effort to get an eyeful
1	his face was the colour of his trousers
1	he did not succeed
1	all the works of modern social philosophy must converge toward that end
1	they get up to all kinds of mad antics
1	the number made louis-philippe king
1	fauchelevent had been ready for anything , except that , that a gravedigger could die
1	he thought he was putting marius on the right track and that the boy was about to give in
1	the crowd gathered there , at the side of the road , is addressed by an officer with an imperious gesture : when the tsar passes , the thing to do is to remove your hat
1	we know the rest : the irruption of a third army , the disintegration of the battle , eighty-six fire-breathing maws suddenly thundering ; pirch the first surging forward with bülow , zieten ’ s cavalry led by blücher in person , the french driven back , marcognet swept off the ohain plateau , durutte dislodged from papelotte , donzelot and quiot beating a retreat , lobau sideswiped ; a new battle gearing up as night fell over the dismantled regiments , the whole english line taking the offensive once again and driven forward , the gigantic hole made in the french army , the hail of english bullets and the hail of prussian bullets lending each other support ; the extermination , disaster along the front , disaster along the flank , the guard falling into line under this horrifying collapse
1	indeed , what more could you want ?
1	the multitudes regarded these beds of putrefaction with an almost religious fear as monstrous cradles of death
1	in the billiard room , ma hucheloup , matelotte , and gibelotte , variously changed by terror , one stupefied , one breathless , the third now actually awake , were tearing up old dishcloths and making lint ; three insurgents were helping them , three great strapping lads with long hair , beards , and moustaches , who were going through the cloth with the nimble fingers of laundry supervisors and throwing them into a flutter
1	and then you ’ ll spend years in a dungeon , bolted to a wall , groping for a drink from your pitcher , gnawing on a horrible loaf of blackness even dogs wouldn ’ t touch , eating beans the worms would have got to before you
1	i ’ m going to dim the candelabra
1	this only happens among men
1	what a thing it is to swallow an oyster or a revolution the wrong way !
1	madame thénardier was just smart enough to read that kind of book
1	the doctor was startled
1	in daylight , you would have recognized that it was just an ordinary miner ’ s spike
1	enjolras went on : who here has the courage ?
1	the most important man in greece for fifty years was the grammarian philetas , number who was so tiny and thin that he was forced to put lead in his shoes so he didn ’ t blow away in the breeze
1	the gate did not budge
1	the soul that loves and that suffers has attained the sublime
1	he then went on to the italian front and was one of the thirty grenadiers to defend the col di tende with joubertnumber joubert was made adjutant general and pontmercy second lieutenant
1	a fearsome method , and one that , allied with genius , made this sombre athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for fifteen years
1	e nature of art , promoting instead its communication
1	each one taught only its own lesson , unchanging over time , and intended only for those whose vocation it was to leave behind a memory of their actions and accordingly draw an example from the memorable deeds of other men worthy of being remembered
1	teeth and claws dread the intangible
1	did you read what i put there , on that bench ?
1	tholomyès , put in blachevelle , behold mon calme
1	the child , with his brioche that he had mauled but not finished , looked stuffed
1	white clouds were scudding across the sky as gaily as if they had just been released from captivity
1	a compliment is something like kissing through a veil
1	the man took three steps and went over to the lamp that was on the table
1	that is the thread by which he hung on to humanity
1	then he stamped for some little time on the ground in the space bounded by the tree and the stones , as though making sure the ground had not been freshly dug
1	the accused , for his part , listened to them with the stunned look that , according to the prosecution , was his principal defence
1	he said in a half whisper : splendid !
1	those two did not need to be told twice
1	do you recognize me a little ?
1	he always stuck his hands in his fob pockets
1	he addressed the public and asked in a tone that was understood by all : is there a doctor in the house ?
1	in this leaden place , there is darkness but there are no more secrets
1	monsieur leblanc and his daughter had just left their bench , the daughter had taken her father ’ s arm , and they were making their way together , slowly , to the middle of the walk , where marius was
1	the elder daughter was scraping the mud off the hem of her mantle , the younger sister went on sobbing ; the mother had taken the girl ’ s head in both hands and was covering it with kisses , whispering to her : now , now , my treasure , it ’ s nothing , don ’ t cry , you ’ ll make your father angry
1	the paths were lined with stiff little dark shrubs that shot straight up
1	so , misery , worry , a bit of bread here , a bit of heartache there , it all keeps me going
1	’ cause it ’ s so tender , it bends under the scythe
1	a few seconds later , the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything peculiar except that the tenderfoot was too young and looked like a real hick
1	l ’ aigle de meaux , as we know , lived rather more with joly than anywhere else
1	he had just seen , out there in the street , society , represented by a property owner and voter , number physically and verbally abused and vilified by a creature who was beyond the pale , an outcast
1	great blunders are often made , like great ropes , out of numerous strands
1	he wore blue trousers , a blue redingote , and a broad-brimmed hat , all of which looked new , a black tie , and a quaker shirt , meaning , dazzlingly white but made of coarse material
1	while we agree that it was not for some political role that god had created monseigneur bienvenu , we would have understood and admired him if he had protested in the name of right and liberty , if he had put up fierce opposition , perilous and just resistance to napoléon , when napoléon was all-powerful
1	he took up a lot of space in sixteen-year-old imaginations
1	thank you , monsieur , answered jean valjean softly
1	seventh : for a dropped thread , ten sous are held back from a prisoner in the weaving workshop ; this is an abuse on the part of the contractor , since the cloth is just as good
1	he was no longer pale , he was white
1	the name history ’ was given to the anthology of such great examples , worthy of being learned , represented , meditated upon , imitated
1	you ’ re driving me mad !
1	when anyone , soldier , officer , or representative of the people , ventured to cross the lonely roadway , which they did from time to time , a faint but sharp whistling would be heard and the person would fall , wounded or dead ; or , if he escaped , a bullet would be seen sinking into some closed shutter , into a gap between rubble stones , into the plaster of some wall
1	cosette had a minor setback
1	then these others : conde de rio maïor
1	pretot , who was also to die in the struggle , seconded mavot and to the question , what is your goal ?
1	what sort of man was he ?
1	now , for an unhappy man in his position , the convent was at once the most dangerous and the safest place to be ; the most dangerous , because no man could get into it , so if he were discovered there , it would be in flagrante delicto , and being caught in the act for jean valjean meant just a skip and a jump from the convent to the clink ; the safest , because if he managed to get himself accepted and to stay , who would think of looking for him there ?
1	monsieur leblanc had hardly uttered more than a few words , and that without raising his voice ; even in his struggle with the six brigands by the window , he had kept profoundly , and strangely , silent
1	it was no longer merely terror that took hold of her but something even more terrible than terror
1	he went on , answering the first question she had asked him as though he had just heard it : i was praying to the martyr up above
1	and , going over to enjolras , he whispered in his ear : don ’ t worry
1	thénardier , in shoving jean valjean outside in his stead , gave the police a bit of bait , threw them off his own scent , got himself overlooked in a much bigger haul , rewarded javert for waiting , which always placates a police spy , earned himself thirty francs , and found a means , one he was certainly counting on , of bolting with the aid of this diversion
1	a doll makes its entrance
1	he recognized the voice of the old woman , his concierge
1	grantaire admired , loved , and venerated enjolras
1	she looked like a virgin on her way to becoming a goddess
1	for some moments , jondrette had been studying the philanthropist in a bizarre way
1	we are leaving , we have left
1	their first convent was built new in the rue cassette with the funds provided by mesdames de boucs and de châteauvieux
1	who did this anarchic doubter rally to in this phalanx of absolutists ?
1	well , well , so there ’ s going to be another revolution , is there ?
1	and with that , she smiled
1	was there any proof ?
1	as for the convent , its gratitude to fauchelevent was great
1	in any case , he was going on a short trip
1	to blow that man ’ s brains out myself
1	when madeleine had popped up in the area , fauchelevent , a former scrivener and peasant who was almost literate , had a business that was going bad
1	almost at the same moment as the boys , another pair approached the great pond
1	i ’ m just passing through
1	in the process it turns ugly
1	that old face had none of those unfortunate wrinkles at the top of the forehead that signify meanness or stupidity
1	he was a prudent man
1	but no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet
1	you have to resign yourself to it
1	the eight of clubs , for instance , was a big tree bearing eight enormous clover leaves , a sort of fantastic personification of the forest
1	in paris , the identity that binds an individual to themselves snaps from one street to the next
1	in the end , come what may , the gravedigger is waiting , the panthéonnumber for some of us , but we all end up in that big hole in the ground
1	he gave his final instructions in the downstairs room in a voice that was clipped , but profoundly calm ; feuilly listened and answered on everyone ’ s behalf
1	and who is this man ?
1	he looked for some time at the english barricades on both roadways , two broad abatis of felled trees , the one on the genappe road above la haie-sainte equipped with two cannons , the only ones in the whole of the english artillery trained on the battlefield , and the one on the nivelles road where the dutch bayonets of chassé ’ s brigade glinted
1	wellington , oddly ungrateful , declares in a letter to lord bathurstnumber that his army , the army that did battle on june number , number , was a despicable army
1	he must have been really keen to see a soul carted off by the devil
1	it ’ s like a cellar
1	you can see for yourself , he ’ s a dashing young man , he is fearless , you can see he ’ s a thinker , these young artillerymen are extremely well educated ; he has a father , a mother , a family , he ’ s probably in love , he can ’ t be any more than twenty-five years old ; he could be your brother
1	but even there , he had lost love ’ s instincts and sudden illuminations
1	as you can see , he had a strange , idiosyncratic way of looking at things
1	in which case marius did not stay
1	he fitted the key into a lock , though the keyhole was barely visible , lost as it was in the darkest shades of the design of the wallpaper on the wall
1	passersby told him the man and the child he was looking for were heading off toward the woods near gagny
1	a manly voice was heard to cry out : long live france !
1	and every box passes through the worker ’ s hands thirteen times !
1	if such a hell were to exist , this stretch of the boulevard de l ’ hôpital could well serve as its approach
1	while the executioner was burning the great liberating books of the century on the steps of the palais de justice , writers now forgotten were bringing out , with the king ’ s seal of approval , all kinds of weirdly subversive writings avidly read by the dregsnumber a few of these publications , sponsored by a prince , amazingly , can be found in the bibliothèque secrète
1	for men of thénardier ’ s ilk , all dialogue is a battle
1	( i don ’ t understand how god , the father of men , can torture his children and his children ’ s children and hear them crying out without being tortured himself )
1	fauchelevent headed for the door
1	was napoléon ’ s obvious physical decline coupled with a certain inner diminution by that stage ?
1	but i am still a public letter-writer
1	society ’ s cannibals , the ugolinos , number are found in this abyss
1	gavroche lifted it with remarkable vigour and propped it against one of the elephant ’ s front legs
1	on the whole , we have to say , waterloo was more of a massacre than a battle
1	they spoke to him about it , one day , and just for a moment , there was a flash of lightning , like a window suddenly opening on the destiny of these creatures he had loved , then everything shut again ; he never heard another word about them again , not ever
1	how far did the cuirassiers get ?
1	would marius die there of a hemorrhage and himself of starvation ?
1	as you didn ’ t lie about your name , you won ’ t lie about your address
1	javert walked very slowly away
1	the stars had gone out ; heavy clouds filled the horizon all around with their melancholy billowing
1	this was the precaution a cunning man takes to keep his secret to himself in front of his accomplices
1	the bishop grabbed his stick , put his overcoat on to hide his cassock , which was getting too threadbare , as we ’ ve seen , and also because the evening breeze would not be long in rising , and left
1	the opportunity seemed to present itself
1	one old lady , a subscriber to the drapeau blanc , number made this unfathomably deep observation : i can ’ t say i ’ m sorry
1	its explosions , its bad days , its masterpieces , its wonders , its epics spread to the ends of the earth—and so do its cock-and-bull skits
1	he did not try to fold his chasuble in imitation of elijah ’ s mantle ; number he did not throw any ray of light from the future onto the shadowy unfolding of events ; he did not seek to condense the glimmer of things into a flame ; there was nothing of the prophet or the seer about him
1	this horde of men , dimly lit by a single candle , filled the lair with shadows
1	beneath the apparent contradiction lies something great and profound : the french revolution
1	this represented a sleeping woman and a sleeping child , the child on the woman ’ s knee , an eagle in a cloud with a crown in its beak , and the woman taking the crown off the child ’ s head , and without its waking up , too ; in the background , napoléon in a blaze of glory was leaning on a fat blue column with a yellow capital adorned with this inscription :
1	this letter , cropping up in the middle of the obscure episode that had been worrying marius since the night before , was a candle in a cave
1	and , lowering his carbine , he aimed at the gunner captain who , at that moment , was bent over the breech of the cannon , adjusting and finally setting the aim
1	he sought to counsel and to calm the desperate by pointing to those who were resigned , and to transform the grief that gazes on the freshly dug grave by showing it the grief that gazes up at a star
1	she brought her hands together with an expression that held all the violence and all the gentleness that prayer can hold
1	at six o ’ clock in the evening , he went down the rue saint-jacques to dine at rousseau ’ s , number opposite basset ’ s , the print dealer at the corner of the rue des mathurins
1	there ’ s going to be some strife
1	he is not perhaps entirely to blame
1	they danced a little , they laughed a lot ; it was a good-natured wedding
1	and he held out to her the envelope containing the four letters
1	where can it be coming from ?
1	the patrol set off again , leaving jean valjean behind them
1	actually , they ’ re all saints here
1	there is no robespierre who can hold out , woman rules
1	the comic , the serious , the unpredictable , blend in it with the variety of the characters and with a tinge of romantisism lightly spred all threw the plot which works misteriously and goes , by striking twists and terns , to come to a head amid several wunderful stage coups
1	messieurs , what ’ s the hurry ?
1	nothing will stop me
1	follow marius for a while
1	what ’ s up , i wonder ?
1	i ’ ll go and see my auntie
1	this suitcase used to intrigue cosette because of the smell of embalming that came from it
1	he must have had beautiful horses ?
1	in great and exalted natures , physical pain brings out the soul , through the revolt of the flesh and the senses against it
1	it ’ s every man for himself in times of peril
1	when we speak of convents , those seats of error , but also of innocence ; of befuddlement , but also of good intentions ; of ignorance , but also of devotion ; of torture , but also of martyrdom , you almost always have to say yes and no
1	but what is dark down there is light up here
1	women feel and speak with the loving instinct of the heart , that infallible organ
1	as for cosette ’ s education , it was almost finished and complete
1	he bounded over to this table , took a key from his pocket , and opened the suitcase
1	meanwhile , on the left bank , the municipal cavalry swung into motion and came to bar the bridge exit ; on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the célestins and deployed along the quai morland
1	the marly horses , number those whinnying chunks of marble , reared up in a golden cloud
1	all right , then , it ’ s the convent of petit-picpus !
1	that person thinks they ’ ll climb out again easily , and tells themself that it ’ s the same thing , after all
1	how easily , having attained that false aim of life , happiness , we forget the real aim , duty !
1	we can well imagine
1	we won ’ t insist , this is not the place
1	the young girl was there with monsieur leblanc
1	on the table there was also a pen , a lead inkwell , and spare paper for eventual police reports and the statements of the night patrols
1	and anyway , they were already stolen
1	and , after a pause , he went on : monsieur le maire , you were unjustly severe with me the other day
1	this service plautusnumber performed , whether he wanted to or not , by making two carthaginian soldiers speak phoenician ; this service molière performed by making so many of his characters speak levantinenumber and all sorts of dialects
1	it ’ s worth the trip
1	sire , the man with the petition went on , my grandfather was a whipper-in , a dog man , nicknamed lesgueules , muzzles
1	but there ’ s nothing for sale , nothing for hire , not for five hundred francs , and not for a thousand , neither
1	he took two five-franc pieces out of his bag and handed them to the priest
1	cosette got dressed pretty fast , combed and did her hair , which was a very simple business in those days when women did not puff up their curls and their coils with little cushions and tiny rolls or stick crinolines in their hair
1	monsieur madeleine said to the doctor : well ?
1	let them get themselves out of it
1	on penal questions , marius , though he remained a democrat , was still stuck on the side of the ruthless legal system and he had , about those whom the law strikes , all the ideas of the law
1	these two hearts poured themselves out to each other and into each other , so that at the end of an hour , the young man had the soul of the young girl and the young girl had the soul of the young man
1	the facts , however , are not so easily thrown off , and they persist
1	was he , lastly , really the man thénardier thought he recognized ?
1	the moment they were least expecting it , the captain launched his men against the barricade
1	though , if the bishop had one of his priests to dinner , madame magloire took advantage of the occasion to serve monseigneur some wonderful fish from the lake or some fine game from the mountains
1	enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms he had had put aside
1	madame , the baker was shut
1	so what you ’ re saying is , she went on sharply , you don ’ t know her , but you ’ d like to know her
1	what she felt at that moment was something like what she would have felt if someone had suddenly said to her : little girl , you are the queen of france
1	these doctrines , these theories , these forms of resistance , the unexpected necessity for the statesman to consult the philosopher , blurry half-glimpsed evidence , the need to create new policy in accord with the old world without causing too much discord with the revolutionary ideal , a situation in which lafayette had to be used to defend polignac , number the hint of progress transparent in the riot , in the chambers , and on the street , rivalries to balance all around him , his faith in the revolution , maybe some indefinable sense of resignation deriving from vague acceptance of a definitive and superior right , his desire to remain true to his race , his sense of family , his sincere respect for the people , his own honesty—all these preoccupied louis-philippe almost painfully at times , and as strong and courageous as he was , overwhelmed him with the difficulty of being king
1	they had crossed the river and left mont-saint-éloy behind them
1	instead of flowers among the branches and dew on the flowers , you could see the long silver ribbons of slugs on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves ; but in every case , whatever the aspect , whatever the season , spring , winter , summer , autumn , this little enclosure breathed melancholy , contemplation , solitude , freedom , the absence of man , the presence of god ; and the old rusty gate looked as if it were saying : this garden is mine
1	the only thing going for him was that he was a drunk
1	the prefecture knew less than the cabdriver
1	the thénardiers invariably wrote back : cosette is in perfect health
1	painting the inhuman ’ means setting out places and figures in a kind of history painting that declines to make any comment
1	at the police station of the place du châtelet
1	and his smile switched from the sun to the boy
1	it is beset by negation
1	he woke up , stammering : is it over , jondrette ?
1	france that finds himself on a voyage for his homeland and lack in funds
1	jean valjean sometimes said to her , smiling with happiness at being pestered : go home , for heaven ’ s sake !
1	he went on the prowl in the deserted no-man ’ s-land beyond la salpêtrière ; that is where the windfalls are ; where there is no one , you always find something
1	this destiny , the true one , begins for man at the first step inside the grave
1	give me twenty francs
1	it was her father
1	as for the cost of episcopal services , redemptions , dispensations , baptisms , sermons , consecrations of churches and chapels , marriages and so on , the bishop took from the rich all the more greedily for giving it all to the poor
1	the violent jolts of fate have this peculiar feature , which is that , however perfectly controlled or detached we may be , they drag human nature out of the depths of our entrails and force it to reappear on the surface
1	two old trees stand there ; one is dead , the other is wounded in the foot and grows young again every april
1	at the top of the stairs , he pulled another key from his pocket and opened another door with it
1	her bodice was never opaque enough , never climbed high enough
1	suddenly he stopped in his tracks
1	it also makes sense of the recent innovation not only of a counter culture , opposed to the culture of the bourgeoisie , but also of an art that is frankly counter-nature , peddling as it does a eugenics that has finally triumphed over all prejudice absolutely , in spite of the numberless horrors of the waning century
1	the english army was sleeping
1	cosette , who made it a rule to please her father and for whom , in any case , all spectacle was fresh and new , accepted the distraction blithely with the good grace of adolescence and did not pout too disdainfully at this joyful romp known as a fête ; so much so that jean valjean could tell himelf he ’ d carried it off , and that no trace of the hideous sight remained
1	who knows whether a sort of infernal glimmer might not remain on that angelic brow ?
1	he was , as you will recall , of that antique race of old men who await death perfectly erect , whom age burdens without buckling , and whom even sorrow does not bow
1	vincent de paulnumber has divinely portrayed the sister of charity in words that vividly paint the combination of a high degree of freedom with a high degree of humility : his sisters were to spend their time nursing the sick in their homes , having no monastery but the homes of the sick , no cell but a hired room , no chapel but the parish church , no cloister but the streets of the city or wards of the hospital , no fence but obedience , no gate but the fear of god , no veil but holy modesty
1	at midday , he would stop to eat and the midday meal was virtually the same as his breakfast
1	it had not been carted away
1	add to that , the police are less than useless [ a useful repetition ]
1	we ’ ll go to the forest or i ’ ll burst
1	what ’ s the latest on mum ?
1	any rogue could get the better of him and his servant scolded him
1	this is canonical enslavement in all its self-abnegation
1	what a shame i ’ m lame , we ’ d step up the pace , otherwise
1	it is enough that it is a potential convent for me to have to take it into account
1	and he took marius ’ s head and cradled it with both arms against his breast , and they both wept
1	a mere half an hour separated him from what was to come
1	and , words tossed out meandering along the way they do , a minute later , after a detour via jean prouvaire ’ s poetry , combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgicsnumber to one another , raux to cournand , cournand to delille , pointing out the few passages translated by malfilâtre , particularly the bit on the miracles and wonders surrounding the death of caesar ; and , at that word caesar , the conversation swung back to brutus
1	yet , completely in control of himself as he was , he could not escape a surge of inner turmoil
1	and yet , a new day was dawning and its soft light was settling over his life and over his soul
1	he always passed close by the bench where she sat simply because that was his habit
1	they have to stick to the straight and narrow
1	give it to me , the man went on
1	i ’ ve spent nineteen years in the clink
1	so wrote the great art dealer , rene gimpel , in his diary of
1	that particular day , cosette ’ s glance drove marius wild , marius ’ s glance made cosette tremble
1	she had had a very bad night
1	a formidable maw was now open on the barricade
1	in voting for the republic , that is what i voted for
1	monsieur fabantou , he said , i have only those five francs on me , but i ’ m going to take my daughter home and i ’ ll return this evening ; it ’ s this evening , isn ’ t it , that you have to pay ?
1	this is where the mystery of languages lies
1	cosette adored the old man
1	after the abbé of saint-germain , the king granted letters patent and the rest , the abbatial charter and royal license , was ratified in number in the chamber of accounts and in parliament
1	monsieur mabeuf was very close to eighty at the time
1	each dray or , better still , each ladder was harnessed to four horses in tandem
1	there ’ s a knack , crick , crack , in no time at all , you ’ re up and you ’ re on your own
1	these four men , four broad-shouldered porters , went and positioned themselves behind the table where the man from the rue des billettes was leaning , without doing anything that might attract his attention
1	for him , owing money was the beginning of slavery
1	tell-tale sign of a defect , a handicap , the loss of colour of the rising tide under the efiects of maritime pollution
1	he rushed downstairs and reached the boulevard just in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du petit-banquier to go back to paris
1	i ’ ve got eighty francs
1	he occupied an old and vast apartment on the first floor , between the street and the gardens , furnished right up to the ceilings with huge gobelin and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes ; the subjects on the ceilings and the wainscoting were repeated in miniature on the armchairs
1	they saw the old man appear in the doorway of the tavern
1	but the bishop somehow managed
1	the candles haven ’ t , though !
1	marius had learned in montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the hapless innkeeper
1	the empire faded to a shadow that resembled that of the dying roman world
1	that we sold so we could eat at night !
1	god performs his miracles however he sees fit
1	he resolutely hurdled a wooden fence and found himself in the garden
1	but the constancy of song will
1	the insurgents become lepers
1	france had its eyes on paris ; paris had its eyes on the faubourg saint-antoine
1	the thirty-eight loopholes cut by the english at irregular heights are still there
1	i land impoverished by the sea
1	that ’ s what it is to be young ; the young quickly dry their eyes ; they find pain pointless and simply don ’ t put up with it
1	ecstasies in which they forget to kiss
1	to marius ’ s mind , if he accepted this offer , his position would be both better and worse at once ; he would gain material well-being and lose his dignity ; it was complete and beautiful adversity turned into ugly and absurd inconvenience , something similar to a blind man ’ s gaining sight in one eye
1	finally he raised his head trying to look merely satisfied but looking perfectly triumphant
1	as for the man , he really was so tired that he did not even enjoy the nice white sheets
1	everything ’ s going to rack and ruin ; the world is a pain in the neck
1	this vile sand that you trample beneath your feet , throw it into the furnace , and if it melts there and boils , it will become sparkling crystal
1	just as well he left it for me , though , the old bastard !
1	wellington is just a hero like any other
1	marius noticed on that occasion that monsieur fauchelevent spoke well and even with a certain linguistic flair
1	on the back , the colonel had added :
1	so no matter what he does , venerate whoever bears the sign of starry eyes
1	what did he do during this part of the trip ?
1	they were a sad bunch , enveloped by a poverty that was slowly squeezing them dry
1	they left their home county
1	one thing was striking and gave him pause for profound thought , like a warning whispered by providence itself : the walls scaled , fences hurdled , luck tried to the death , the long hard climb uphill , all these same efforts he had made to get out of the other place of atonement , he had made to get into this one here
1	the odd thing was that she looked both poorer and prettier ; two steps you would not have thought possible for her to take
1	and with a sovereign movement , the frail young man of twenty pushed the stocky and robust picklock onto his knees in the mud , bending him like a reed
1	when these poor beings have grown into men , the millstone of the social order almost always catches up with them and grinds them to a pulp , but while they are still children , they escape , being little
1	and she slumped in a heap as though she were dying herself
1	they ’ re a pack of wolves !
1	the documentary will only attain its human factuality by imitating fiction , even beyond its logic
1	jean valjean seemed to have one last hesitation and , tonelessly , almost breathlessly , he stammered out rather than spoke these words : now that you know , do you think , monsieur , you who are the master , that i should not see cosette anymore ?
1	doesn ’ t she have a little girl she ’ s keen to see ?
1	a clash of principles is like a shock in the elements
1	a good thing , father fauvent
1	they ’ d chase away the graces for flashing too much bosom
1	marius waited in vain all day
1	he stages a coup d ’ état , because there is a break in the connection between the present and the future and because , even being god , he can ’ t make the two ends meet
1	she squeezed gueulemer ’ s big rough fingers with her weak bony little skeleton ’ s hand and went on : you know very well i ’ m no fool
1	to lose themselves is what they live for
1	you light your candles for me
1	you , thénardier said to her , stay out of it
1	they would not stop to speak but would just nod to each other sadly
1	if you want to get an idea of all the gigantic proportions that come together to make up a ship of the line , you only have to duck under one of the covered slipways , six stories high , of the ports of brest or toulon
1	with an industry , the manufacture of black glass beads , he made the fortune of a whole town
1	the ballots were collected in caps
1	she had all the doors and windows carefully shut everywhere , got toussaint to go over the entire house from cellar to attic , shut herself up in her room , shot the bolts , looked under her bed , got into bed , and slept badly
1	in the lower rooms they read subversive pamphlets
1	jean valjean was poised this moment at the most perilous of such crossroads
1	the four couples conscientiously got through all the folies champêtresnumber then possible in the country
1	it is not a matter of any equality in rank ’ in the eyes of the camera
1	we are at the pinnacle , so let ’ s have a higher philosophy
1	her fate was beginning to intoxicate her
1	the bed had not been slept in and on the bed were laid out , trustingly , the coat and the black ribbon
1	well then , cried the old man impetuously with a pain that was poignant and full of anger , what do you want with me ?
1	the good lord is more than just , my brother said
1	he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette
1	my poor boy , you ’ re going the wrong way , laziness is giving you bad advice ; the toughest of all work is theft
1	boulatruelle had let the individual pass and it didn ’ t occur to him to approach him , because he told himself the other bloke was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and would probably whack him when he saw who he was and figured out that he ’ d been recognized
1	in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge , jean valjean let go of all that had been troubling him for some time
1	their job had been to go at night and collect from the scaffold the heads and bodies of those guillotined during the day ; they then carried off these streaming trunks on their backs and their red convict smocks had a permanent crust of blood at the back of the neck , wet at night , dry in the morning
1	monseigneur bienvenu was no genius
1	as for the six hundred thousand francs , you haven ’ t mentioned them to me but i know what you ’ re thinking—it ’ s a trust
1	you ca not hear a heart beating anymore
1	that was what brujon had written in the middle of the night
1	he had taken as his motto : never a lawyer be , and for his coat of arms a night table on which a square capnumber might be glimpsed
1	polignac is a rioter ; camille desmoulinsnumber is a ruler
1	this could be seen by the complete lack of young priests flocking around him
1	the next day , the toulon paper ran these few lines :
1	when we added your age to mine
1	this silhouette had something unspeakably mean and disturbing about it , the whole look was of what was then known as a fop ; the hat was stylish , the redingote was black , well cut , probably of good fabric , and cinched at the waist
1	they don ’ t have much money and yet they ’ re bringing up a poor kid someone dumped on their doorstep !
1	we are not saying this is what happened , of course
1	i see your cabriolet going by from my window
1	remember what the name meant to him !
1	chenildieu burst out laughing
1	for them it is like a hangover from number imaginations once fired , they say , do not calm down in a day
1	the good women who passed by took him for beelzebub , then they recognized boulatruelle and were scarcely more reassured
1	what ’ s more , he maintained a superior skepticism about all things , a great strength in the eyes of the weak
1	all he had to protect himself from bullets was the bulging half-columns that divide the shops ; he remained pinned in this delicate situation for close to half an hour
1	it is the people ’ s very substance that is being carried away , here drop by drop , there in gushing torrents , by the miserable vomiting of our sewers into the rivers and the copious vomiting of our rivers into the ocean
1	the sixth man , who had not yet opened his mouth , began to inspect the gate just as éponine had done an hour earlier , gripping each of the bars in turn and jiggling them carefully
1	he went on : pardon me , what were you saying , monsieur fabantou ?
1	the congregation thought a lot of him
1	the concierge began to scratch away at the grass that was growing in what she called her pavement with a knife , and while tearing out the grass , she mumbled : that ’ s a shame
1	you ’ re to get a charcoal fire going in the stove
1	i exist , murmurs that someone known as everyman
1	he took a shortcut to the seine , reached the quai des ormes , followed the quai , passed la grève and stopped , at some distance from the place du châtelet guardhouse , at the corner of the pont notre-dame
1	he reread the four lines , but he did not believe it
1	i don ’ t know you , either , answered laigle
1	before you grab a stick with thorns , you put gloves on
1	he saw his old general joubert fall at novi just as he raised his sword and cried forward !
1	this time , it ’ s me
1	marius had just emerged from his
1	the poor unfortunate wretch who aspires to deliverance finds the means , sometimes without any tools beyond a pocketknife or an old razor blade , to saw a sou into two thin sections , two discs , to then hollow out these two sections without touching the imprint of the mint , and to cut a screw thread along the edge of the sou in such a way that the sections screw back together again
1	the debris that had fallen off the back of the elephant onto its belly had filled up the concave space so that you could walk around as though on a floor
1	one of them cried : let ’ s exterminate them to the last man and die on the point of our bayonets !
1	down in what they call the room of the dead
1	you won ’ t find one !
1	what do you want the government to do with little wastrels who ’ ve got nothing better to do than think of ways to upset everyone , just when things were starting to quiet down a bit again after all the troubles we ’ ve had
1	he dived back into the darkness as though boring through it , with the rigid speed of a projectile ; the little rue de l ’ homme-armé became silent and solitary once more ; in the blink of an eye , that strange child , who had both shadow and dream in him , had sunk into the mist of those rows of black houses and been lost there like smoke in the dark ; and you might well think he ’ d blown away and vanished if , a few minutes after he disappeared , a resounding noise of breaking glass and the splendid crash of a streetlamp shattering onto the pavement had not brusquely woken up the indignant bourgeois once more
1	they dived under the trees in the boulevard behind him and were a dim white smudge in the darkness for a few seconds before vanishing altogether
1	marius continued to be careless
1	he told himself that javert and his spies might not have gone , that they had doubtless left people in the street to keep watch , that if this man found him in the garden , he would cry thief and hand him over
1	and he set off again
1	like looking for a needle in a lousy haystack !
1	they reclaimed the light wearing the mask of night
1	a quick and decisive moment , critical for every orphan , whether poor or rich , for wealth does not protect you from making a bad choice ; misalliances are made very high up the ladder ; the true misalliance is that of souls ; and , just as more than one unknown young man , without name , without birth , without fortune , is a marble capital that supports a temple of grand feelings and grand ideas , so some other man of the world , self-satisfied and opulent , with polished boots and polished words , if you look , not at the outside , but at the inside , that is , at what is reserved for women , is nothing more than a crummy little dive dimly haunted by violent , sordid , and debauched passions—the cabaret sign-post
1	javert ’ s whole person screamed spy—and an underhand spy at that
1	rise up , by all means , but only to grow
1	revolutions have tremendous arms and lucky hands ; they hit hard and choose their targets well
1	faced with someone whose eyes see nothing , think carefully and be afraid
1	another time , marius happened to be going down the rue jean-jacques rousseau between enjolras and courfeyrac
1	if you squeezed their noses , milk would come running out !
1	we know the rest
1	this is what was happening in monsieur madeleine ’ s bedroom
1	the day after that , he did not leave his bed
1	the aunt examined the note , turned it over and around , then put it back in the locket
1	and that was when he put snow on me
1	she had only one child with her by then , a little boy , the baby of the bunch
1	they could see his back , and the stream of blood gushing from a hole in the middle of it
1	the strange thing was that he thought he recognized monsieur leblanc
1	and , if it was heresy to pray outside the sacred texts , then saint teresa and saint jeromenumber were heretics
1	at the barricade in the rue greneta , a man appeared on horseback and handed something that looked to be a roll of silver to the man who seemed to be in charge of the barricade
1	this was where marius had come the first time he had absented himself from paris
1	the new respite that the assailants were allowing the barricade had indeed been extended
1	why can ’ t my wife have the wit to give me a child like that !
1	the facit indignatio—anger writes poetry—replaces the gracchinumber
1	but what the drama would gain , the truth would lose
1	it just happens , like that
1	do you hear anyone else say : i ’ ll eat tomorrow !
1	he was dreaming of her
1	you attain the height of esteem if you manage to cut yourself badly , to the bone
1	the assailants , hurtling into the cabaret , their feet tangled up and tripping over the panels of the door which had been battered in and thrown on the floor , found not one combatant inside
1	he opened a drawer in his secretaire , pulled out a few banknotes , shoved them in his pocket , closed the secretaire again and rang
1	the nun ’ s dead , he said
1	my brothers , have pity !
1	how sweet of you to have put that pillow behind my back !
1	this is an art that has made the corner of the courtyard of the conciergerie in paris , where the prisoner batte-molle escaped twenty years ago , so famous and feared
1	hurry up and get down , go on , hop it , my little elf , you ’ re the young one
1	you mustn ’ t let yourselves be so stunned by this rather stunning pun
1	gavroche , busy singing , whistling , humming , charging ahead and banging shop shutters with the butt of his hammerless pistol , paid the man no attention
1	he looks like he ’ s following someone
1	several years went by this way ; cosette was growing up
1	agree , compashionate man , that you have to experience the crullest want and that it is truly painfull , to obtain some releef , to have it attested by the authorities as if we wernt free to suffer and to die of starvashion waiting for someone to releev our missery
1	you ’ ve got my place and i ’ ve got yours
1	monsieur myriel could be called to the bedside of the sick and dying at any time of the day or night
1	marius had fallen into a mental hornet ’ s nest
1	to get his silence paid for ?
1	the tread of the patrol was becoming more and more distinct
1	and the funny thing was—for in this century the revolution has to muscle in everywhere—that this impeccably feudal salon was , as we have said , dominated by a bourgeois
1	the camera has captured these images faithfully
1	these are beings from the great neutered species ; geldings , parasites , nonentities , who have a bit of land , a bit of giddiness , and a bit of wit , who would be hicks in a salon and think themselves gentlemen in a barroom , who talk about my acreage , my woods , my peasants , hiss and boo actresses at the theatre to prove they are men of taste , pick fights with officers of the garrison to show they are men of war , hunt , smoke , yawn , drink , sniff tobacco , play billiards , ogle travellers alighting from the coach , live at the café , dine at the inn , have a dog who gobbles up the bones under the table and a mistress who slaps down dishes on top of it , hang on to their loose change for dear life , go overboard for whatever is in fashion , admire tragedy , despise women , wear out their old boots , ape london via paris and paris via pont-à-mousson , lose their marbles with age , never lift a finger to work , don ’ t do any good and don ’ t do much harm , either
1	cosette was going away
1	these two candlesticks held two wax candlesnumber and they sat as a rule on the bishop ’ s mantelpiece
1	was he buckled so far as to break ?
1	in this mysterious balance sheet that the reflective marius was drawing up for jean valjean , he noted the credit , he noted the debit , and he tried to reach a balance
1	he thought of the double march that was going on at that moment in the shadows , crime advancing on one side , justice coming from the other
1	from the political standpoint , there is only one principle : the sovereignty of man over himself
1	one day jean valjean went downstairs , took three steps into the street , sat down on a curbstone , on that same curbstone where gavroche , on the night of june number , had found him musing ; he stayed there for a few minutes , then went back up
1	she thought of sending for her
1	she is a caterpillar
1	inside him , horror and fatigue
1	hence , for the commander in chief , the necessity of examining the slightest tuft of vegetation and of digging into the slightest contour
1	good , i hear you say ?
1	the missus has coughing fits
1	i ’ m sick of my cake
1	it is more hypocritical than irreproachable
1	they are , said enjolras
1	you will recall marius ’ s hesitations , palpitations , terrors
1	what did he say ?
1	for the rest , the place , being kept by two women , was always in a state of exquisite cleanliness from top to bottom
1	father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine , and monsieur madeleine had become monsieur le maire
1	the poor woman gazed all around her
1	when the moment came , as the archbishop was walking past the boarders , mademoiselle bouchard , to the unutterable horror of her companions , broke rank and said : monseigneur , a day off
1	who the hell is he going to take those flowers to ?
1	and when he was within reach , he grabbed him swiftly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him up
1	make a note of this extenuating circumstance
1	that ordinary men saw his life , but the bishop saw his conscience
1	the cannonballs made holes in the cuirassiers
1	meanwhile , trust the little ’ uns , don ’ t trust the big ’ uns—
1	hardly was the light extinguished when a weird tremor began shaking the netting the three children were lying under
1	old man gillenormand smiled
1	there was a full moon that night
1	how much will you give me for it ?
1	the immense incomplete exists in nature
1	she stopped crying from shock
1	her heart ached , but she made her decision
1	it was not yet possible to say
1	the burial takes place at the vaugirard cemetery just before nightfall
1	he feared he might have said too much , he raked his hair hard with his nails and refrained from saying more than : ah , there it is
1	such trains of thought and heartache can not be interrupted
1	in number , the author of this book held in his own hands the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in number
1	it did not close ; he turned round and saw that a hand was keeping it open
1	it is spelled faux , fauq , and faoucq
1	the whole night , she saw that stone as big as a mountain and full of caves
1	all that day , cosette was in a kind of haze
1	his hand was shaking
1	whose is the vile hand that furtively slips into victory ’ s pocket ?
1	marius had only one more step to take
1	number what are you doing that to the door for ?
1	what was there this time in the young girl ’ s gaze ?
1	in those days , a dandy was put together with a big collar , a big cravat , a watch dangling charms , three different coloured waistcoats worn one on top of the other , with the red and blue on the inside , and then an olive-coloured short-waisted jacket with tails and with a double row of silver buttons tightly buttoned right up to the shoulder , and lighter olive trousers , decorated at both seams with ribs of a random , but always odd , number , ranging from one to eleven , that limit never being exceeded
1	he went easy on women and the poor , feeling that the weight of human society fell on them
1	in his lair a tiger had a good hoot
1	even the public were admitted through a sort of quarantine entrance provided on the street
1	the intermittent reflections from the air vents appeared only at very widely spaced intervals and the light was so wan that daylight was like moonlight ; all the rest was mist , miasma , opacity , blackness
1	answered the elder boy , gazing at gavroche with the expression of a rescued angel
1	in the period when he was most desperately destitute , he noticed that young girls turned around when he passed and , with a heavy heart , he fled or hid
1	oh yes i have !
1	the latent man that existed in each was altogether different
1	but to be fair , even to selfishness , the state to which that part of the nation that we call the bourgeoisie aspired after the shake-up of number was not inertia , which gets tangled up with indifference and laziness and contains a bit of shame ; it was not sleep , which assumes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams ; it was a halt
1	from something javert let slip , it was clear he ’ d done some secret research , with an inquisitiveness in keeping with the breed and having as much to do with instinct as with any deliberate intention , sniffing out any former traces that father madeleine might have left behind elsewhere
1	the bible says : go and multiply
1	he had once been a pruner , after all , and was glad to find himself a gardener again
1	they stepped into the street
1	he put them to good use
1	so you really shouldn ’ t be surprised at that six hundred thousand francs , monsieur pontmercy
1	twenty years ago , you could still see at the southeast corner of the place de la bastille , near the dock of the canal dug out of the old moat of the prison-citadel , a bizarre monument that has already been wiped from the memory of parisians yet that deserved to leave a trace there , for it was something that a member of the institut , commander in chief of the army of egypt , number no less , had come up with
1	there , the archbishop , aga khan of heaven , number locked up and spied on this seraglionumber of souls reserved for god
1	on the appointed day , he went to the minister ’ s
1	he asked out loud , perfectly distraught
1	jean valjean shuddered with the unconquerable tremor of the wretched victims of fate
1	under both the empire and the restoration , one after the other , he had enjoyed the two forms of bravery necessary to the two epochs , bravery on the battlefield and bravery at the rostrum
1	gavroche stuck his head up , amazed by the size of this gros sou ; he looked at it in the dark , and the whiteness of the gros sou dazzled him
1	behind closed doors , he gently poked fun at god
1	someone whom you do not answer back saw to it
1	he would come out with all manner of crude , obscene , and filthy remarks with wondrous calm and an unflappable air of elegance
1	her father was down below on the lawn
1	aren ’ t we friends anymore , then ?
1	you ’ re losing the thread of the speech you were going to make me , monsieur the attorney , that ’ s irritating
1	the tragic picture we have begun to paint would not be complete , the reader would not see , in their exact and actual relief , these great moments of society in labour and giving birth to revolution , in which the convulsions are mixed with sheer hard work , if we leave out of the outline sketched here , an incident full of epic and savage horror that occurred almost immediately after gavroche left
1	marius ’ s eyelids did not lift ; but he breathed through his half-open mouth
1	meanwhile , she had planted herself in front of marius with a trace of joy visible on her livid face and something that resembled a smile
1	it seems that all the time he had been there—over an hour—lost in his thoughts , he had vaguely been aware of the fancy goods shop lit up with little lanterns and candles so splendidly that you could see it through the tavern window like an illumination
1	the message could not have come far
1	buddha and the dragon , mused monsieur mabeuf sotto voce
1	aunt gillenormand had got out of bed
1	he remained speechless , utterly lost for words
1	marius enjoyed himself enormously
1	at around two o ’ clock , almost invariably , you would see his carriage and the royal cavalcade stream past furiously on the boulevard de l ’ hôpital
1	how could he condemn the victim and spare the assassin ?
1	the dadaists did the show as a matinee in berlin and the high point of the programme was a race between a typewriter and a sewing machine
1	cried the astonished director
1	oh , no , we won ’ t allow any more trips
1	it was floating on the water
1	the chapter has assembled
1	i ’ m talking about their cheese dairies , which they call fruitières
1	they never risk going beyond it
1	besides , cosette could not quite remember what marius had told her about being away , which was supposed to be only for a day , and what explanation he had given her
1	i complete the restitution in saying my real name
1	you think staying silent is simple ?
1	what would be demeaning , then , for the son of colonel pontmercy , in the impending fight ?
1	the generation currently taking its turn on this earth is not obliged to shorten its passage for the generations to come , who are its equals , after all , and will later have their turn
1	you didn ’ t know i was an old coward
1	you know very well , answered thénardier
1	jondrette did not need to be told twice
1	to paint a battle , we need those powerful painters whose brushes are dipped in chaos ; rembrandt would be better than van der meulennumber van der meulen was accurate at midday but lies at three o ’ clock
1	his name is dehaze
1	she walked over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder
1	listolier and fameuil were engaged in a discussion about their teachers and were explaining the difference between monsieur delvincourt and monsieur blondeaunumber to fantine
1	they were no longer eyes ; they were the deep window on the soul that replaces gazing eyes in certain long-suffering people ; such a look seems oblivious to reality , reflecting past horrors and calamities in a blaze of fierce light
1	his whole life would have been useless , all his penitence wasted , and there would be only one thing left to say : what is the point ?
1	in a corner next to the opening marius was looking through , hanging on the wall in a black wooden frame , was a coloured engraving at the bottom of which was written in capital letters the dream
1	and so on and so forth
1	then again , when two lovers understand each other , it all goes very smoothly ; any third party , no matter who , that might disturb their love , is kept completely in the dark by a few precautions that are always the same for all lovers
1	marius then saw that what he had taken for a shapeless heap was a rope ladder , very well made , with wooden rungs and two large hooks for hanging
1	maman said she ’ d take us to get blessed palms on palm sunday
1	there was no way of opening the gate
1	in the middle of this vile rumination , the ideas we just mentioned kept stirring around in his brain , coming and going and coming back again , seemingly bearing down on him like a ton of bricks ; and then , without knowing why , and with that automatic persistence of reverie , he thought at the same time about a convict named brevet whom he had known in jail , and whose trousers used to be held up by a single brace of knitted cotton
1	isn ’ t there in every human soul , wasn ’ t there in the soul of jean valjean , in particular , an initial spark , a divine element , incorruptible in this world , immortal in the next , that good can bring out , prime , ignite , set on fire and cause to blaze splendidly , and that evil can never entirely extinguish ?
1	he did not know himself anymore , he no longer counted
1	between the armchairs , in guise of a carpet , an old bedside rug had been spread showing more warp than wool
1	and with that , he blew out the candle
1	at the bottom of the garden , an avenue of great poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent at the corner of the rue droit-mur to the house of the little convent at the corner of aumarais lane
1	i ’ ve had a gutful of despotism
1	we have moved on from the days when those terrifying swarms of people erupted in france , when you could hear beneath your feet a muffled and obscure stirring , when molehills mushroomed mysteriously on the surface of society , when the ground cracked open , caves yawned , and you saw the heads of monsters suddenly rear up out of the ground
1	the kind of magnetic instinct that alerts the eye made monsieur leblanc turn round almost at the same time as marius
1	all of a sudden , he spotted the two little ragamuffins , motionless behind the little green swan house
1	but why the workman ’ s getup ?
1	the convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by sheer cliffs
1	now there ’ s an overseer we could do without , said enjolras
1	his eyes were closed , his matted hair stuck to his temples like dried brushes that had been dipped in the colour red , his hands hung down , lifeless , his limbs were cold , there was coagulated blood at the corners of his mouth
1	i happened to be crossing the square as you were carting this woman away
1	this ruin is recognizable by two big square windows that can still be seen there ; the one halfway up , closest to the gable on the right , is barred by a worm-eaten joist propped against the wall like an upright beam
1	these encounters seemed to really throw boulatruelle
1	travel expenses incurred in pastoral rounds ?
1	monsieur marius … baron marius pontmercy , by jove !
1	the rathole was so dark that anyone coming in from outside felt like they were entering a cellar
1	she came in , shut the door behind her , stopped to catch her breath , for she was quite winded , then shouted with an expression of triumph and joy : he ’ s coming !
1	first , the duties of all ; second , the duties of each one according to his station in life
1	toussaint ’ s bed was also stripped
1	to send one down , or drop the other ?
1	nowadays the priest is the only man who can routinely become king—and what a king !
1	deliberate about the citizen artillery !
1	but what he was really furious about was his pistol ’ s not having a dog—a hammer
1	that done , he crossed his legs and lay back in his chair , in the manner of a man who is sure of what he is saying ; then he took the plunge and tackled the subject gravely , stressing every word with great emphasis : monsieur le baron , the sixth of june , number , roughly a year ago , the day of the riot , there was a man in the grand sewer of paris , over where the sewer comes out at the seine , between the pont des invalides and the pont d ’ iéna
1	don ’ t blow a gasket , come with us , let ’ s hit the bottle together
1	the idea of exploring these pestilential regions did not occur even to the police
1	something of the sort has already been seen
1	on both sides they seemed rooted to this deathly soil
1	an eastern tale has it that the rose was made white by god , but that when adam looked at it as it was beginning to open , it was ashamed and went pink
1	what was the good of living , what was there to live for now ?
1	you only have to let yourself slide down , we ’ ll catch you
1	certain flashes of fire can only come from certain souls ; the eye , that cellar window of thought , is set ablaze ; glasses hide nothing ; you might as well stick a pane of glass on hell
1	opposite the passage de l ’ ancre , a drummer received a thrust of a dagger
1	did you see how i pulled that out of the bag for you , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of february !
1	still hidden in the crook of the rue mondétour , marius had watched the first phase of the battle , irresolute and shivering
1	while they were in this predicament , a great chest was brought in and deposited in the presbytery for monseigneur the bishop by two unknown horsemen who promptly turned their mounts and charged off
1	it rallied , but kept out of sight
1	for four years he had been waiting for marius resolutely—that is indeed the right word—in the conviction that the naughty little rascal would ring at his door one of these days ; now he had reached the point where , at certain mournful hours , he told himself that if marius took his time even a little longer … it wasn ’ t death that he found unbearable , it was the idea that he might never see marius again
1	for a long while now , i haven ’ t seen you
1	and what about the trip !
1	at that initial phase of love , a phase when sensual pleasure keeps absolutely still under the all-powerfulness of ecstasy , marius , the pure and seraphic marius , would have been rather more capable of visiting a streetwalker than lifting cosette ’ s gown up to ankle level
1	his thoughts gradually became unbearably black
1	of the production revol u tion
1	the sister , who had no idea of distances , replied : oh , i ’ m sure he can be back here tomorrow
1	you look at this surface bubbling away apparently without a cause ; you don ’ t see the hydra scuttling along the bottom
1	where have all the beautiful girls gone ,
1	that ’ s why i ’ m here telling you all this
1	they always make these stoves too hot
1	all the rest looks like a toothless jawbone
1	you are true comedians
1	it is to measure being and non-being
1	the grandfather shivered from head to toe , as much as ossified limbs can shiver , and his eyes , their corneas yellow due to his great age , filmed over with a sort of glassy gleam
1	that is the theory of the clever
1	since the days when the author of this book still lived in paris , two have died
1	she did not look at herself anymore and for a fortnight tried to do her hair with her back to the mirror
1	that done , he got himself to montfermeil
1	ecclesiastes names you the almighty ; the maccabees name you the creator ; the epistle to the ephesians names you liberty ; baruch names you immensity ; the psalms name you wisdom and truth ; john names you light ; the book of kings names you lord ; exodus calls you providence ; leviticus , holiness ; esdras , justice ; creation names you god , mankind names you father ; but solomon names you mercy and of all your names , that is the most beautifulnumber
1	once he was under the elephant , he let fly with a bizarre cry that doesn ’ t belong to any human tongue and that only a parakeet could reproduce
1	only , of course , these a-significant ’ moments have a very precise function : the thing that allows itself to be apprehended in them , within the suspended fiction , is simply the life ’ that the characters in the meaningful action are endowed with by the same token
1	coarse paper , clumsy folding , the mere sight of certain missives puts you off
1	but that didn ’ t stop marius pressing ahead
1	he slowly wrote the lines that follow :
1	cock an ear , montparnasse , d ’ you hear all the yapping in the clink ?
1	he was well read and rather erudite
1	after the disbanding of gaspard bès ’ s gang of crooks , number which had overrun the gorges of ollioules , one of its lieutenants , a man named cravatte , decided to seek refuge in the mountains
1	a few men around a flag marked the place of one regiment , another battalion was now commanded only by some lieutenant ’ s captain ; alten ’ s division , already so badly battered at la haie-sainte , was almost destroyed ; the intrepid belgians of van kluze ’ s brigade were strewn over the fields of rye all along the nivelles road ; there were almost none left of the dutch grenadiers who joined our ranks in spain in number to fight against wellington and who rallied to the english in number in their fight against napoléon
1	you know , cosette , your husband is very handsome ?
1	three hundred sous , said fauchelevent
1	at around six o ’ clock in the evening they had reached chelles
1	not a cloud in the sky
1	his house in the rue des filles-du-calvaire , as we said , belonged to him
1	at forty , a man ’ s finished
1	he had no idea what a father and mother should be like
1	it could rain all it liked , as often as it liked , paillasse , pantaloon , and gillesnumber were not about to call it a day
1	showing the annihilation , as claude lanz­mann does in shoah , therefore implies that you have linked a theory about history with a theory about art
1	tomorrow ’ s truth borrows its method—battle—from yesterday ’ s lie
1	that , moreover , was the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother
1	provided they are face-to-face with immensity , they smile
1	the first was skinny and had a long cudgel with an iron tip , the second was a sort of colossus , carrying a pole-axe for slaughtering cattle , holding it by the middle of the handle with the hatchet part pointing downward
1	jean valjean aimed at the dormer and fired
1	the students would say : ah , monsieur leblanc ’ s on his bench !
1	jean valjean changed numbers in jail
1	the old woman was grumbling
1	jean valjean went on
1	the glimmer of light vanished and everything became indistinct again ; immensity seemed to open out there
1	the besieged , alas , uses anything he can as a weapon
1	next day monsieur mabeuf received an invitation to dinner at the minister ’ s
1	what ’ s a man to do ?
1	i took a second street
1	she exchanged with her husband a few words all the more furious for her not daring to utter them out loud : stupid old goat !
1	he could hear the octogenarian breathing
1	cried the old man in a terrible voice
1	it was the days when they had great big sheep in the tuileries that used to pull the little carriage of the king of rome
1	they are dressed in black and wear a wimple that , according to the express command of saint benedict , comes right up under the chin
1	to hear this school : the riots muddied the waters in number and robbed that great event of part of its purity
1	high walls protected from any living distraction the mystical sultaness who had the crucified one for a sultan
1	it ’ s a good thing grantaire ’ s asleep
1	hello and goodbye , said jean valjean
1	he had never been a father , lover , husband , friend
1	in the middle of the slightly convex garden , on top of a grassy knoll , there was a beautiful fir tree , pointed and conical , from which four great allées radiated , as from the pointed hub of a shield ; arranged in pairs between the spokes of the broader walkways , eight small paths radiated , so that if the enclosure had been circular , the geometric plan of the garden paths would have looked like a cross laid on a wheel
1	one person digs with an idea , another digs with numbers , yet another digs with rage
1	and after a pause , she went on : i don ’ t think i ever had one
1	the place was incredibly bleak
1	just the simple coil of chains of a hundred-gun ship is four feet high , twenty feet wide , and eight feet deep
1	if anyone knew who he was , it was his own doing
1	the world is what it is
1	don ’ t make me go to jail for six months !
1	then he picked up his carrier , put back in the cartridges that had fallen out , without losing a single one , and , advancing toward the fusillade , went and stripped another cartridge pouch
1	progress is an honest man ; the ideal and the absolute do not pick pockets
1	he hissed between clenched teeth
1	and he quickly told the kid that , that same day , in the morning , babet had been transferred to the conciergerienumber and had escaped by turning left instead of right in the halls of justice
1	wherever it tries to be alive , we attack it and do our level best to kill it
1	i ’ ll see cosette tomorrow !
1	he was the spectator of his own drama , like a person at a play he doesn ’ t understand
1	we have just seen how marius discovered that she was called ursula—or thought he had
1	they went to ground
1	before the major works begun in number got off the ground , the underground network of paris was subject to sudden cave-ins
1	the confidence with which monsieur le baron honours me makes it my duty to say so
1	there was no address on one side , no seal on the other
1	it was precisely something of the kind that happened on the afternoon of june number down by the seine , on the embankment of the right bank , a bit beyond the pont des invalides
1	it is our heritage
1	what ’ s the good of being on top if you can ’ t see past the next man ’ s nose ?
1	one day , shortly after mother magnon had handed éponine the note about the rue plumet , the police suddenly descended on the rue clocheperce ; mother magnon was seized along with mamselle miss , and the entire household , which was suspect , was hauled in
1	he had not examined and weighed up the right man claims to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable
1	one doesn ’ t need to be hungry to eat a cake
1	all the things were black
1	in villages that he found to be without a schoolteacher , he also cited the case of queyras
1	what ’ s become of these men ?
1	if , at that supreme moment , the newlyweds , dazed with sensual rapture and believing themselves alone , were to listen , they would hear in their room the muted sound of fluttering wings
1	on top of this , paris was stirring ; for anyone who had something in his life to hide , the political turmoil offered this disadvantage , the fact that the police had become extremely nervous and extremely jumpy , and that in their efforts to track down men like pépin or morey , number they could well uncover a man like jean valjean
1	it ’ s true , it ’ s very cold !
1	their veils are knitted with night
1	any violent step backward is riot ; to recoil is an act of assault and battery against the human race
1	the frenetic storm of murder that was raging a few feet above him did not reach him , as we said , thanks to the thick chunk of earth that separated him from it , except in a muted indistinct way , like rumbling at a great depth
1	thénardier raised his right hand to his forehead and shaded his eyes with it ; then he knitted his eyebrows together as he blinked , which , along with a slight pursing of the mouth , typifies the sagacious attention of a man straining to place another man
1	jondrette noticed that monsieur leblanc was staring at the men
1	the king , who was laughing , went on laughing , passing merrily from the two bishops to the two attorneys and agreeing to let these men of the robe off their names , or almost
1	etymology : over england ; from one territory to another ; to ireland
1	death is dead , believe me
1	before the bayonet touched gavroche , the gun slipped from the soldier ’ s hands , a bullet had hit him in the middle of his forehead , and he fell on his back
1	on the tip of the central island by the pont-neuf the word redivivus was sculpted on the pedestal that awaited the statue of henri ivnumber in the rue thérèse , no
1	a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of dough replaces the fiat luxnumber suppose the drop is fatter and the spoonful bigger and what have you got ?
1	we need to know about them , if only to avoid them
1	and then you ’ ll see its ears and then you ’ ll see its tail and you ’ ll get a shock
1	he went on in a voice so weak , he could barely be heard : so his identity was confirmed ?
1	don ’ t forget , monsieur , that you are in our power , at our discretion , that no human authority can get you out of here , and that we would be really sorry to be forced to resort to unpleasant extremes
1	all of a sudden he felt a real pang of hunger
1	all that for nothing !
1	cosette took marius ’ s hand and squeezed it without answering
1	two days after the events we are relating at the moment , he left , thanks to marius , for america , under a false name , with his daughter azelma , armed with a draft for twenty thousand francs to be drawn in new york
1	it was the splendid time when the grande armée had marengo behind it and austerlitz ahead of it
1	this wall is hidden outside by a great quickset hedge ; the french arrived , thinking they had only the hedge to tackle , leaped over it , and found the wall , an obstructive hurdle and an ambush , the english guards entrenched behind it , thirty-eight loopholes all firing at once , a storm of grapeshot and cannonballs ; and soye ’ s brigade was smashed against it
1	basque , who was in any case absolutely respectful , opened the door of the downstairs room , saying : i ’ ll go and let madame know
1	the child picked off a bit of this clay with his little fingers and ate it
1	when the doctor has stuck a visa for paradise in the passport , the undertakers send in a coffin
1	under the rue saint-denis , there is an old stone sewer dating from louis xiii ’ s day that runs straight into the main sewer , known as the grand égout , the grand sewer , with only a single sharp turn , on the right-hand side , under the old cour des miracles , and a single connecting drain , the saint-martin sewer , whose four intersecting arms form a cross
1	jean-luc godard , in germany year nine zero , and in the histoire ( s ) du cinéma , thereby questions the century through a dialogue between the leninist dream factory and the hollywood dream factory ; the images of escheated socialist germany and capitalist germany through a phrase of rilke 's , reference to goethe , the music of bach and beethoven , but also the silent music of the gramophone in people on sunday or of siegfried 's death in lang 's nibelungen , the statue and the verse of the sovietized pushkin or the image of don quixote overtaking , in his utopian ’ stampede , the broken-down trabant , that automobile of real socialism ’ made in east germany
1	montparnasse , in fact , had run into éponine on the boulevard where she was keeping watch under the trees and had taken her with him , preferring to play némorin to the daughter rather than schinderhannesnumber to the father
1	the porter stuck his head out , yawning , vaguely awake , candle in hand
1	and how cunningly people manage to feed their vanity via the tomb !
1	it ’ s only half past twelve
1	this will all take a good hour
1	the format had shrunk but freedom of expression had mushroomed
1	here are the names of the main onesnumber they belong to a certain extent to history : enjolras , combeferre , jean prouvaire , feuilly , courfeyrac , bahorel , lesgle or laigle , joly , grantaire
1	lobau at one end and reille at the other are rolled in the torrent
1	all the neighbouring churches were scoured
1	fauchelevent saw them , touched them , spoke to them , and didn ’ t believe it
1	he peered through the glass as he had done at the tavern
1	a kind of lettered clerk !
1	without the tree , she would have fallen
1	father , what do you expect me to do with it ?
1	and you used to keep a greasy spoon of a place in montfermeil
1	i will confine myself , since monsieur le maire wishes it , to the case of the citizen in question
1	it was the voice of jean valjean
1	it was distance forced into proximity , compulsory intimacy
1	it made him laugh
1	keeping the promise made to the dead woman
1	if the ocean went in for dikes , this is how it would build them
1	he stayed away for a fortnight
1	something indefinably sad enveloped her ; she could feel his eyes on her rather than see them
1	there were just a few die-hard rumourmongers who said : you can be certain that the road-mender from gagny didn ’ t root around like that for nothing
1	as he approached the gate , he forgot everything
1	he climbed out of the coffin and helped fauchelevent nail the lid back on
1	it was grantaire who had discovered corinthe
1	you ’ ll make my grandfather jump for joy if you play whist
1	he sensed the situation was urgent and that it was now vital to get to the seine whatever the risk
1	jean valjean did not try to dislodge the hand that held the collar of his coat
1	but this monster is not yet perfect , however , for its kafkaesque metamorphosis is incomplete the 'four-legged chicken ' is in fact an experimental failure worthy of featuring in the bestiary of a jerome bosch !
1	after some hesitation , he decided to speak to this man , but not without first looking in front and behind , as though he were frightened someone might overhear the question he was about to ask
1	at that , the host bent down to his ear and said to him in a tone that made him jump : get out of here
1	he approached the hut ; for a door it had a very low and narrow opening , and it looked like one of those buildings that road menders throw up by the side of the road
1	the lock was visibly locked with a double turn
1	how should i know ?
1	if history does not show itself without the construction of some kind of heterogeneous fiction , that is because it is itself made up of heterogeneous tenses , of anachronisms
1	you ’ ve nothing left to do now but to ask my permission !
1	what would you like to be ?
1	the elevation of the escarpment can still be measured today by the height of the two great burial mounds that hem in the genappe-to-brussels road ; one of these , the english grave , is on the left ; the other , the german grave , is on the right
1	nothing amused him like being extravagantly generous
1	i petite rue picpus , no
1	in the long arm were the cells of the mothers and sisters and the novices ; in the short arm the kitchens , the refectory backed by the cloister , and the church
1	speaking of which , i have to ask you something
1	you could have broken a leg
1	he thinks of the murky adventures of his corpse falling through the limitless gloom
1	a fortress—and a mousetrap , courfeyrac quipped , laughing
1	at those moments , a bolt of lightning could have fallen thirty feet away and they would not have noticed , so deeply absorbed were they in each other
1	he admired , instinctively , his opposite
1	from the man , he had easily arrived at the name
1	courfeyrac did not want to be left behind so he called himself plain old courfeyrac
1	what the matter is , is that i ’ m hungry , answered gavroche bluntly
1	monsieur leblanc did as he was told
1	but our man took the shortcut : the gospel
1	the man pulled a fat leather purse from the pocket of his smock and answered : i have money
1	it was no longer fear she felt , it was not only curiosity ; it was the beginning of anxiety
1	no name on the stone
1	some , like maistre , admire it ; others , like beccaria , number abhor it
1	could thénardier have been mistaken ?
1	if the two poor little boys had listened and been old enough to understand , they would have been able to reap the words of a grave man
1	basque came back , placed a burning candle on the mantelpiece , and withdrew
1	sensual pleasure sets its soft seal there , while staying well out of sight
1	aunt gillenormand watched this irruption of light in her quaint old home in amazement
1	the compliance of matter is limited by friction ; isn ’ t there a limit to the compliance of the soul ?
1	so , it ’ s over , what luck !
1	all this was done without reference to absolute right
1	a touch of egypt and bohemia in the lower orders accommodated the upper spheres and suited the purposes of the high and mighty
1	i ’ m appalled by such petty theft
1	her creditors were even more merciless than ever
1	fifty miles farther on , growing bolder than ever , with his barge he attacked and captured a large english transport ship ferrying troops to sicily , so loaded up with men and horses that the vessel was full to the hatches
1	every man , even the best , has in him an unthinking harshness that he holds in reserve for animals
1	these sorts of things are nothing if not normal
1	in front of the porte saint-martin a young man armed with a carbine attacked a cavalry squadron single-handedly
1	it is not wise to question sinister situations to the nth degree , especially when the indissoluble side of our own life is fatally involved
1	but what is above the sun , then ?
1	my children , get it into your thick noggins that this is for real
1	he observed mother jondrette for a moment
1	the individuals may be eradicated , but the tribe lives on
1	the six hundred thousand francs really are cosette ’ s
1	the sky was just a sinister density
1	only fanatics and lunatics deny it
1	ah , well , replied monseigneur bienvenu without arguing , if it ’ s nonsense , the soul should shut itself up in it like a pearl in an oyster
1	that makes a good impression
1	let me tell you this : i was once set up in business , i was licensed , i was a voter , i ’ m a respectable citizen !
1	combeferre was limply defending it
1	just grab a hammer and hammer the nails in a floorboard !
1	it ’ s a handy little dive
1	she called him father , knew him by no other name
1	why do you say ah ’ ?
1	you will cry for me a bit , won ’ t you ?
1	he lived with old fauchelevent in the shed at the bottom of the garden
1	those members of the cougourde of aix who were in paris gathered at the time on the issy plain , in one of the numerous abandoned quarries on that side of paris
1	having reestablished el rey neto in spain , france could certainly reestablish the absolute monarch on home turf
1	the expedient would have been puerile
1	it seems , as we have already remarked , that he thought , along with all those who have ever been wise , holy , and just , that his first duty was not to himself
1	of course , the elephant … is it cosy ?
1	pa , a voice cried , he ’ s out
1	and this is what they came up with : this champmathieu , about thirty years ago , worked as a tree pruner all around the country and especially in faverolles
1	he ran on for quite some distance , peering around , calling out , shouting , but he met no one
1	one day he gave the following sermon in the cathedral :
1	his inmate pals helped him as they do in such sad places
1	you can also shout by using rubbish and that 's what i did , glueing and nailing [ … ]
1	surprise on the part of boulatruelle
1	i have romans , men and women [ here the word is illegible ] —the whole retinue
1	hardy types , who can ’ t resist a gamble , have thereby often enough , we are assured , opened up the holes dug by the black man and tried to rob the devil
1	the prisoner remained thoughtful for a moment , then he took up the pen and wrote : mademoiselle fabre , care of monsieur urbain fabre , rue saint-dominique d ’ enfer , no
1	find a way of getting me out like cosette in a basket and under a lid
1	in the encounter that took place , jean valjean was veiled and thénardier unmasked
1	for five years marius had lived in poverty , in deprivation , even in distress , but he realized he had never known real misery
1	it is paved for a considerable part of its course
1	he had at times , accordingly , sustained with his own credit and his own funds the tulle factory in boulogne , the mechanized flax mill in frévent , and the hydraulic textile manufacturing of boubers-sur-canche
1	in the depths of her irises there was a point of amazement where terror lurked
1	monsieur gillenormand took the letter in trembling hands , read it , ripped it in half and chucked it into the wastepaper basket
1	it can ’ t be anything , he said
1	in the eerie amplification of that initial moment , he almost imagined that the hinge had come alive , suddenly taking on a terrible life of its own and barking a warning to the world like a dog rousing the sleeping from their slumber
1	the horror got worse and worse
1	i don ’ t abhor this particular government
1	oh , why had his father died so soon , before his time , before justice was done , before his son came to love him !
1	god can go to hell !
1	many of those intrepid men , who had embarked on the most frightening of adventures without turning a hair , now turned their heads away
1	the prioress was waiting for them , rosary beads in hand
1	marius , my boy , you are a baron , you are rich , stop this pettifogging , i beseech you
1	otherwise , he was the cheeriest of the lot
1	the fall in value of a pile of écus had bankers singing the marseillaise
1	this made them laugh all evening
1	i was forced to give up the profession of author
1	it needs a nipper , brujon chimed in with the barrières slang
1	the candle , spreading out like a giant mushroom , barely lit the cavernous vastness , the fire had died down , and all these monstrous heads made deformed shadows on the walls and ceiling
1	they are so ridiculous where i come from
1	there was nothing there , inside the houses , but fear , mourning , stupor ; in the streets , a sort of awestruck horror
1	cosette started to laugh , too , all her ghoulish speculations fell away , and the next day , over breakfast with her father , she poked fun at herself over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of chimney pots
1	there won ’ t be much left for dinner
1	but the prisoner spoke up : you are poor worthless wretches , but my own life is not worth being so heavily guarded
1	seeing which , the barricade started to laugh
1	and then again , anyway , it ’ s you who got me a place here , it ’ s your business
1	i feel that you make cosette happy
1	the dinner , as we were saying , was winding down
1	wood and wine were kept in a kind of semi-subterranean recess lined with loose stones right next to the door on the rue de babylone , a space that had once served as a grotto to the presiding judge ; for in the days of follies and country cottages , no love affair was complete without a grotto
1	bright sunshine streamed into the room
1	speaking of which , how was the letter to this old codger signed ?
1	it was now three days since she had seen marius
1	the officers looked around
1	these are the darkly radiant
1	you got ta be one jump ahead
1	the impression swiftly passed , but for the moment it was irresistible
1	as he weaved through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil , he had spotted this little shadow , struggling along groaning , dumping its burden on the ground , then picking it up again and walking on
1	as long as you ’ re like this , i won ’ t let you have your daughter
1	thénardier shoved the hankie in his pocket
1	and you call me monsieur !
1	he gently disentangled himself from cosette ’ s arms and grabbed his hat
1	jupiter was setting in the depths of the sky
1	i was three years old
1	fauchelevent shot back , clutching at straws , however weak
1	six o ’ clock rang out at saint-médard
1	i must warn you , i ’ m not part of that pack of ninnies
1	flowing beer gathers no head
1	and a moment later he made his entrance into the drawing room where mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was already in position , embroidering her cabriolet wheels
1	despair causes us to freeze
1	so much so that you no longer know whether chekov , turgenev or gontcharov were right about the eternal nature of russian life , doomed to being always the same , always the same as a good semblance of a life ’ , or whether the very movement of that life , its way of being equal to the action and the suffering of history , is to imitate russia 's writers , to make life the same as the words of the masters of the language
1	they shouted at it : revolution , why this king ?
1	can we really have found you again only to lose you ?
1	it ’ s already fun , she said
1	what you saw was the interior of a cloister
1	and yet , only two or three profited by it
1	meanwhile a paper lantern had been lit at the little barricade , and at the big one , one of those wax torches you see at mardi gras in front of the carriages loaded with masks heading for the courtille
1	he derided any allegiance to any party , in the brother as much as in the father , in the young robespierre as much as in loizerollesnumber a fat lot of good it did them , dying , he would cry
1	but it makes no difference , the evidence is there
1	a few hours had been enough
1	you can say o and p , or orestes and pylades , number whichever you prefer
1	one day marius , who was given to talking seriously in the midst of his happiness , said apropos who knows what incident : the men of the revolution are so great , they already have the lustre of the centuries , like cato and phocion , and every one of them already seems like a figure of antiquity
1	this number included madame de beaufort d ’ hautpoul and madame la marquise dufresnenumber another was only ever known in the convent by the alarming noise she made when she blew her nose
1	behind the window of an apartment block in bucharest that is just like all the rest , a hand activated the camera that took a long shot of protesters marching on the presidential palace ( videograms of a revolution )
1	here she stopped , fixed her lacklustre eye on marius and burst out laughing before saying , in a tone that contained extreme anguish smothered by extreme cynicism : gah !
1	there , at the corner we mentioned , it dipped down so low that there was nothing left to see but a wall
1	take these five hundred francs while you ’ re at it and get out !
1	we ’ ll take the wolves ’ rue de rivoli , he said
1	the poor poacher survincent , number who had been through the cellar prison of châtelet , used to say : it was the rhymes that kept me going
1	we brought down the old world , some of us , and the old world , that chamber pot of miseries , tipped over and turned into an urn pouring joy over humankind
1	i ’ d go down to hell for that
1	and then again , shouldn ’ t charity be the greater , the deeper the fall into darkness ?
1	this little kid will grow up
1	the benedictine-bernardines of martin verga , cloistered fifty years ago in petit-picpus , sang the services to a solemn psalmody , pure plainchant , and always at full voice for the whole length of the service
1	so that is why i began to love her
1	he was fluent in italian , latin , greek , and hebrew ; and this served him to read only four poets : dante , juvenal , aeschylus , and isaiah
1	there are six of you ; but i am the rest of the world
1	g—— went on : let ’ s go back to the explanation you requested
1	public education , when it is good , can always bring out the latent usefulness of a soul , no matter what it is like to start with
1	i ’ m really not interested in all the details , to tell you the truth
1	feel how cold i am , she said
1	matelotte had gone back upstairs , grantaire had grabbed her by the waist and pushed her toward the window , with long peals of laughter
1	jean valjean instantly slammed his foot on top of it
1	he went on at length about his age , his infirmities , the weight of the years now bearing down on him
1	cosette turned to him
1	two very severe duchesses , mesdames de choiseul and de sérent , often visited the community , where they gained access no doubt by virtue of the privilege of their status as grandes dames , to the great terror of the boarders
1	no doubt about it
1	though he may have converted his carriage into alms , that didn ’ t stop the bishop from doing his rounds
1	probably to her , since a hand had deposited the packet on the bench
1	the german anatomist actually has invented a process for preserving the dead and , in particular , for sculpting them , by plastination , thereby taking things a lot further than the mere embalming of mummies
1	finally she seemed to reach a decision
1	but the key was in it
1	when the man came nearer , the noise came nearer ; when he moved away , the noise moved away ; if he made a sudden movement , a tremolo accompanied that movement ; if he stopped , the noise stopped
1	the first street on the left
1	it was clear that this man was one of those you do not answer back
1	a heart needs a bone to gnaw on
1	these days , there are those who can ’ t distinguish between the mighty saint bernard and the bernard known as of the catholic poor , a certain good-hearted ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century
1	he lived constantly in such shadow , groping like a blind man or a dreamer
1	combeferre , standing next to enjolras , studied the young man
1	go and sleep somewhere else , yelled enjolras
1	elmira would give alms to belisarius ! number but no , nothing !
1	come on now , this is ridiculous !
1	he had come there from somewhere else
1	and so idleness is a mother
1	of course it ’ s all true
1	to be left-handednumber makes you most enviable
1	well-heeled bourgeois didn ’ t think much of being buried in vaugirard ; it reeked of poverty
1	a thousand thoughts flitted through him , but they only strengthened him in his resolve
1	the sight filled him with jealousy and he had done everything he could to hurt madeleine
1	he chattered away so sweetly and so unintelligibly you ’ d have thought he was a bird
1	everybody who is anybody turns on their wit when the firmament turns on its stars
1	monsieur madeleine wheeled round and recognized javert
1	after that , you can do what you like with me
1	you feel sweetly drunk
1	it could not go on like this
1	your majesty , two of them would need to be placed end to end to make up one of your grenadiers
1	the sight of a sabre or a gun froze him
1	the servant was an old maid called toussaint , or all saints , whom jean valjean had saved from the hospitalnumber and destitution
1	tragedy , which sheds its own light , intensified the thin light of day that was in his mind
1	there are some who don ’ t have a lot of linen , so they ’ re waiting on it ; if you don ’ t get their washing done , you lose the business
1	and then , you have to be careful
1	when it is the heart that is slipping , you don ’ t stop on the way down
1	he was some sort of labourer in a jacket with big pockets and a pick under his arm
1	how would the shell of the barricade behave under cannon fire ?
1	greuze 's inability to represent history in all its majesty will be met with the ability of this or that fascist or soviet painter to serve his cause by concentrating exclusively on the composition of volumes and the distribution of light
1	man plays a supporting role
1	don ’ t forget any of what i ’ ve told you
1	the film is called listen to britain
1	cosette ’ s mother continued : you see , i can ’ t take my little girl back home
1	the dining room was ablaze with cheery brilliance
1	the girls got up to do as they were told
1	with a low forehead , broad temples , a mass of crow ’ s-feet though not yet forty years old , wiry short hair , bushy cheeks , the beard of a wild boar—you can see the man from here
1	mademoiselle gillenormand kissed him
1	and , bowing , he said out loud : monsieur tranchelevent—
1	'this demand encourages the supply of fake documents , sundry reconstructions and conjuring tricks , but surely we could say the same today of art when it comes down to it
1	i ’ m off to the barricades
1	cambronne comes up with the word for waterloo the way rouget de l ’ isle comes up with the marseillaise , number being visited with inspiration from on high
1	the old rattletrap ’ s hitched ?
1	that ’ s the fault of rousseaunumber
1	me , i was fifty-three , i was really pushing it
1	the muck would be almost solid in one place , almost liquid in another
1	it was still the dead of night
1	we got to the stage where we were turning out very good glass beads
1	but it was remarked how the bishop from that point on avoided going near the square where executions took place
1	the good man entered
1	i say : to err is to be in love
1	poor cosette did not say a word
1	like certain church towers , the salon of madame la baronne de t—— had two cocks
1	i ’ ll be going there to testify
1	paris has a boy and the forest has a bird ; the bird is called a sparrow and the boy is called a ragamuffin imp , a street urchin : le gamin
1	look at the room downstairs
1	it was deadly serious
1	you looked , but you did not see anyone ; you listened , but you did not hear a footstep or the faintest murmur of a human voice
1	reverend mother , you can hear the knell much better from here than in the garden
1	gavroche replied : maybe more than you have
1	me , i had my little cosette , i was forced to become a bad woman
1	she ’ s my old lady , said the child
1	how the chain on the shackles must have undergone preparatory treatment to be shattered like that with one whack of the hammer
1	and yet , i give you my most sacred word of honour that , if you go away , i will die
1	she let out a shriek of delight
1	he made further inquiries
1	two undertakers in grey uniforms with black trim were walking to the left and right of the hearse
1	if this really is the case , the academicism of horror will have triumphed , the profane art of modernity bowing down before the sacred art of conformism , its primacy , a conformism that always spawns ordinary everyday fascism
1	gavroche dived back into the dark
1	no tongue could tell all that this word , woman , contained , uttered the way it was by that child
1	in those paintings , a host of small regular luminous splotches of colour are spread in rows over a dark background , at will , figuring the spiritual tension of an abstract homage to the soldier priest helder camarra , or sketching the teeming favelas of his homeland
1	i swore i ’ d go through fire , not water
1	dear boy , you give me such a headache
1	a few pages of history
1	to do your culp you prostrated yourself flat on your face in front of the prioress until she , who was never referred to as anything other than our mother , alerted the culprit , by a little rap on the wood of her stall , that she could get up
1	all of a sudden , between two shots , they heard the distant sound of the hour striking
1	it was concluded that he must have had some connection to the venerable bishop
1	the pigsty he had a bird ’ s-eye view of at that moment was abject , dirty , fetid , putrid , dark , sordid
1	nothing else for it !
1	cosette continued to pluck her daisies attentively ; she seemed to be thinking about something , but it must have been something lovely ; all of a sudden she turned her head back over her shoulder as delicately and slowly as a swan and shot jean valjean a question : father , what are they , actually , these galleys ?
1	monsieur le maire , allow—
1	tholomyès went on : quirites , gentlemen , caballeros , mes amis !
1	he knocks a second time
1	mother thénardier had one of those radiant flushes that unexpected flashes of talent will spur in a person
1	fauchelevent repeated : i ’ m paying !
1	their tall stature and their enormous fists were no less disturbing than their sinister stealth in the darkness
1	after getting his breath for a few minutes , he turned round to where the shooting was raging , brought his left hand up to his nose and thrust it forward three times while smacking the back of his head with his right hand ; a sovereign gesture in which the parisian gamin has condensed all french irony and which is obviously effective since it has already lasted half a century
1	i ’ ll give you a bullet !
1	it makes you think of a mole crying out : i pity them , with their sun !
1	trivia fiends , who collect anecdotes the way herbalists collect dried flowers and prick fleeting dates on their memories with a pin , know that in the last century , in paris , around number , there were two public prosecutors at châtelet , number one known as corbeau , the crow , the other , renard , the fox
1	having been soaked by the rain , they were walking along the paths on the sunny side , the older one leading the little one ; they were pale and in rags and they looked like wild birds
1	it ’ s enough to make you shudder , i know !
1	he spoke to him of the highest truths , which are the simplest ones
1	never joy , always ecstasy
1	there is a point where digging any deeper means being entombed and where the light is completely extinguished
1	and yet it is true ; gravediggers themselves die
1	i go off on my own when i feel like it , sometimes i sleep in a ditch
1	of course , you can make mistakes there , and do make mistakes ; but error is venerable there , for it involves so much heroism
1	i the issue on the surface
1	all eyes sought monsieur fauchelevent
1	marius replied rudely , now that he ’ d begun to notice that this police spy had still not had the courtesy to refer to him as monsieur
1	we don ’ t say home , we say digs
1	and then , you must have cashmeres
1	the old woman did , in fact , have a kind of wicker cariole in her shed
1	as he was leaving them , he arranged to meet them that same evening at the same place , and had left them with these words by way of goodbye : i ’ m going to beat it , in other words , i ’ m taking off , or , as they say at court , i ’ ll skedaddle
1	this has often been the mistake of the bourgeoisie
1	it was the jondrette girl
1	the garden was absolutely still , and all you could see of the street was deserted as always
1	what is there against him ?
1	they worked up the script
1	now , toussaint , as though predestined to be jean valjean ’ s servant , was not curious
1	there was a holy alliancenumber—the belle-alliance that the fatal field of waterloo foretold
1	the point from which he viewed all things was shifting once more
1	i must have had a hallucination
1	sweat trickled down his forehead
1	he wore a horrible old yellow redingote worth several millions , since the lining was stuffed with banknotes
1	you lived in death
1	fancy letting a man like that come into your home !
1	in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris
1	i say , dear bishop , why don ’ t we get right down to it
1	the man from the funeral parlour went and had a word with the cemetery gatekeeper
1	you can ’ t hear a thing down at the bottom of the garden
1	no doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little savoyard
1	the fact is that , if he had only gone a bit further into the cul-de-sac genrot , he probably would have—and he would have been finished
1	some ugly tart that ’ d make you shudder , i ’ ll warrant !
1	to see cosette , to forget by her side , was so sweet to him !
1	after quite a while , not hearing another sound , he turned round without making any noise and , just as he was raising his eyes to the door of his room , he saw a light through the keyhole
1	he thought no more of the girl now that she was beautiful than he had thought of her when she was ugly
1	hitched to a cabriolet ?
1	sometimes it is a defect
1	hougoumont , said the peasant woman
1	as he spoke , he had bent down to tie up a branch of the rhododendron and he went on : wait , i remember now
1	she went on : all i have to do is scream , they ’ ll come running , whoosh !
1	the pedestrian coming from the rue saint-denis and going into the rue de la chanvrerie saw it gradually shrivel away in front of him as though he had stepped into an elongated funnel
1	this anguish melded with the horror she felt at being alone in the woods at night
1	the conventionist , on the other hand , gazed at him with a humble congeniality in which one might have discerned , perhaps , the humility that is appropriate when a person is so close to returning to dust
1	jean valjean saw the problem
1	in his heart of hearts , this prodigious captain was the man who , in his report on aboukirnumber to the directoire , had said : this cannonball of ours killed six men
1	why are they like this ?
1	his reply was sharp and angry : as you can see , my good woman , i ’ m trying to sleep
1	he could well infect you by contagion with incurable poverty , numbing of the joints used for climbing the ladder , and , in short , a tad more renunciation than you ’ d like
1	but this is where the question returned : uphill or downhill ?
1	he had learned german and english ; thanks to courfeyrac , who had put him in touch with his friend the bookseller , marius played , in the literary section of the bookshop , the modest role of hack
1	it was the end of the dictatorship
1	the middle ages aside , asia aside , the historic and political question left open , from a purely philosophical point of view , beyond the requirements of some militant polemics , on the condition that the monastery be absolutely voluntary and shut in only consenting adults , i will always look upon the cloistered community with a certain attentive and , in some respects , deferential gravity
1	woman has been left out
1	in an instant , a fiacre was at the door
1	as they do the monumental spaces of the mediter- ranean ?
1	all at once the idea that the stone had not come and sat on the bench on its own , that someone had put it there , came to her and frightened her
1	the wall above which he could see the linden tree and the ivy obviously enclosed a garden where he could at least take cover , even though there were still no leaves on the trees , and spend the rest of the night
1	because i thought as you did
1	then again , she felt safe , since she was with him
1	i believe the lark truly is your daughter , and it seems only natural that you should hold on to her
1	yes , for anyone other than jean valjean
1	not counting the ravishing chimes that it scattered into the air all the time without anyone knowing why
1	the glance has been so abused in love stories that we have ended up discounting it
1	net result : i ’ m riled
1	the officer went on : look in my pockets
1	as he had guessed , there was a building there and its roof sloped steeply downward from the top of the wooden cladding to just above the ground , on a fairly gentle inclined plane , just touching the linden tree
1	the sweet month of april to gorgeous may
1	then , still caught up in her ballad , she sang through clenched teeth :
1	will monsieur have supper ?
1	these bare feet , these bare arms , these rags , this ignorance , this abjectness , this darkness , can be put to work in the conquest of the ideal
1	the reel on which the rope was wound was housed beneath the lantern in a little iron box
1	for six weeks he had lived , as we said , outside life ; those words—going away ! —brought him down to earth with a thud
1	man is the eel
1	all four girls were deliriously pretty
1	supposing that some living being had been so fabulously thin as to even be able to think about getting in or out through the square hole , the grate would have prevented them from doing so
1	while this was going on the man didn ’ t pay much attention
1	he performed a whole host of good deeds as secretly as other people conceal bad deeds
1	as for other duties , the bishop found them listed and prescribed in other places ; those of sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans ; those of magistrates , wives , mothers , and young men by saint peter ; those of husbands , children , and servants in the epistle to the ephesians ; those of the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews ; and those of virgins in the epistle to the corinthians
1	you don ’ t let go of a mystery once you ’ ve got hold of one
1	a few feats of arms were serious ; the taking of the trocadero , for example , was a fine military campaign ; but on the whole , we repeat , the trumpets of this war produced a tinny sound , the ensemble was suspect , and history backs france in her difficulty in accepting this false triumph
1	the priest was , so they said , a worthy and respectable gent , one who gave good advice
1	the garden ran alongside a lonely unpaved laneway that was bordered with bushes for want of houses ; a hedge separated the garden from the lane
1	these fifty men were expecting sixty thousand
1	i certainly am , monsieur
1	the abbé grégoire , number ex-bishop , ex-conventionist , ex-senator , acquired the status of the infamous grégoire in royalist polemics
1	it seems likely that this vanishing of the hell behind us is part and parcel of arriving in paradise
1	why won ’ t anyone give me a musket ?
1	in spring , the light shines in sad souls just as it shines in caves at midday
1	it appears he took a bath in the seine without being aware of doing so
1	the statistics show that the mortality rate among abandoned infants is fifty-five percent
1	the second was straight , firm , slight
1	reproaches made tonelessly by a dying man to a corpse
1	snorted thénardier , pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand francs
1	it was indeed that poor girl
1	nothing more in the street , nothing more in the garden
1	where are they going ?
1	you ’ re the one who should go , replied the man
1	he did not understand any of this and believed himself to have been short-changed—let ’ s not mince words , robbed
1	all his blood rushed to his heart
1	you ’ re little , said enjolras
1	sometimes the old man would add : good god !
1	the storm of battle still lingers in this courtyard ; the horror is visible there , the reversal of the fray has turned to stone ; it lives , it dies , it was yesterday
1	they entrusted him to god
1	had married , in our happy couple ,
1	at the site of these writings your generous soul will be moved by a feeling of markt benevolence , for true philosophers always experience lively emotions
1	for instance , what i could do is come in the evening , when night is about to fall
1	he bent down and picked it up
1	two fauchelevent brothers had been gardeners at the petit-picpus convent
1	the caribbeansnumber leave nothing but the bones , the dancers leave nothing but the shells
1	i i despite magritte and a handful of others , commercial imagery - verbal art , visual art - would wreak the havoc we are all too familiar with yet which has for some reason provoked less of an outcry than that wreaked by 'socialist realism ' , the official art of the defunct soviet union the comic strip
1	dying a holy death is now forbidden
1	good arrangement for one , good investment for the other
1	the shock stopped both the cart and the orator in their tracks
1	was he concentric to the felony and repression ?
1	he did not hesitate
1	it knows nothing about what is rich , it knows nothing about what is noble
1	and while her mouth thanked mother thénardier , her whole little heart thanked the traveller
1	somebody had carried him from les halles quartier to the champs-élysées
1	show me where you are going
1	so , i ’ ve taken my secret and i ’ ve brought it to you
1	where ’ s he got to ?
1	the certainty of at last holding jean valjean in his hands , captive , sent all that he had in his soul rushing over his physiognomy
1	it seems the thread he thought he held had snapped
1	a tiger attacking a wild ass , a spider attacking a fly
1	he was benevolent , brusque , charitable , and if he had been rich , he would have tended to the lavish
1	you can tell us all about it by letter
1	it represented one tiny moment grappling with centuries of monarchy on the one hand and , on the other , eternal right
1	no thinker worth his salt would dare claim that the scent of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations
1	all around the tulip beds the bees whirled , sparks from the flame-flowers
1	javert poked his head over and looked
1	the first thing to go was craftsmanship , a victim of ind ustrial manufacturing from the eighteenth century onwards
1	marius engaged in sad conjecture ; he did not dare keep watch over the porte cochère during the day
1	there , they pronounce jean as chan , so he ’ s known as chan mathieu
1	now let ’ s cover his corpse and let every one of us defend this old man dead the way he would defend his father alive , and let his presence in our midst make the barricade unassailable !
1	mademoiselle baptistine told what happened at the bishop ’ s place that night so many times afterwards that there are still people living who remember it down to the last detail
1	the hive of joy opened and each one of them brought their honey
1	the gamin came running at the sound of marius ’ s voice , with his face full of joy and devotion
1	scotland has its trios of witches , number but paris has its quartets of gossips ; and the thou shalt be king hereafter , hurled at macbeth on the heath at armuyr , would be just as ominous hurled at bonaparte in baudoyer square
1	there are beings who , to find the answer to such teasing riddles , about which , furthermore , they don ’ t actually give a fig , spend more money , devote more time , go to much more trouble than ten good deeds would require ; and do so gratuitously , just for the hell of it , without being rewarded for their curiosity except by curiosity itself
1	hercules yourselves , are you ?
1	marius ’ s erstwhile sense of distance from this man , from this fauchelevent–cum–jean valjean , was now mixed with horror
1	did you sleep badly ?
1	marius pulled his head away from his grandfather and said , softly : but , father , now that i ’ m doing so well , it seems to me i could be allowed to see her
1	he saw , a few feet away , at the base of the small roadblock so mercilessly guarded and watched from outside , under a collapsed heap of cobblestones that partly hid it , an iron grate lying down flat , level with the ground
1	will you come back again , doctor ?
1	what does she expect us to do with her seven francs ?
1	i must leave you
1	the kid ’ s profound observation brought montparnasse back to calm and common sense
1	is there anyone here who ’ s got the back and the heart for it ?
1	son of a fathernumber to whom history will certainly grant extenuating circumstances , but just as worthy of esteem as that father had been worthy of blame ; having every private virtue and several public virtues ; mindful of his health , his fortune , his person , his affairs ; knowing the cost of a minute and not always the cost of a year ; sober , serene , peace-loving , patient , a good man and a good prince ; sleeping with his wife and having lackeys in his palace whose job it was to show the conjugal bed to the bourgeois , an ostentation of regular intimacy that had become useful after the old illegitimate displays of the elder branch of the family ; knowing all the languages of europe and , what is rarer still , all the languages of all the interests , and speaking them fluently ; admirable representative of the middle class , but outdistancing it and in every way greater than it ; having the excellent sense , even while appreciating the blood from which he sprang , to esteem himself for his intrinsic worth , and on the very particular question of his race , declaring himself orléans and not bourbon ; very much the first prince of the bloodnumber as long as he had been only a most serene highness , but an honest bourgeois the day he became majesty ; diffuse in public , concise at home ; a declared , but not proven , miser , and at bottom , one of those economical types who are easily moved to extravagance when the whim or duty takes them ; literate yet not too fussed about literature ; a gentleman , but not a knight ; simple , steady , and strong ; adored by his family and by his household ; a winning conversationalist ; a savvy statesman , cold inside , ruled by the immediate interest , always sailing close to the wind , incapable of rancour or gratitude , pitilessly wearing out his superiority on mediocrities , skilled at proving wrong through parliamentary majorities , those mysterious unanimities that grumble quietly beneath thrones ; expansive , sometimes imprudent in his expansiveness , but showing marvellous adroitness in this imprudence ; rich in expedients , faces , masks ; frightening france with europe and frightening europe with france ; incontestably loving his country but preferring his family ; prizing domination more than authority and authority more than dignity , a disposition that is disastrous in that , by turning everything toward success , it accepts ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness , but profitable in that it preserves politics from violent clashes , the state from fractures , and society from disasters ; meticulous , proper , vigilant , attentive , sagacious , indefatigable ; contradicting himself sometimes , and giving himself the lie ; daring against austria at ancona , relentless against england in spain , bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard ; number singing the marseillaise with conviction ; impervious to despondency , to world-weariness , to any yen for the beautiful and the ideal , to reckless generosity , to any utopia , to any chimera , to anger , to vanity , to fear ; having every form of personal fearlessness , a general at valmy , a soldier at jemappes ; number having had brushes with death by regicide eight times and still smiling ; brave as a grenadier , courageous as a thinker ; anxious only when faced with the chances of a european uprising , yet unfit for the great political adventures ; always ready to risk his life , never his life ’ s work ; disguising his will as influence in order to be obeyed as an intelligent man rather than as king ; endowed with powers of observation but not divination ; taking little notice of minds but knowing a lot about men , that is , needing to see in order to judge ; prompt and penetrating common sense , practical wisdom , ready speech , prodigious memory ; delving endlessly into that memory , his sole point of resemblance to caesar , alexander , and napoléon ; knowing the facts , the details , the dates , the proper names ; ignorant of the tendencies , the passions , the diverse genies of the teeming hordes , the inner aspirations , the hidden and obscure upheavals of souls , in a word , all that might be called the invisible currents of people ’ s consciences ; a bit out of touch with the france below the surface ; getting by on finesse ; ruling too much and not reigning enough ; his own prime minister unto himself ; excelling at making the pettiness of daily reality a bulwark against the immensity of ideas ; adding to a real creative faculty for civilization , order , and organization some indefinable spirit of procedure and chicanery ; founder and lawmaker of a dynasty ; having something of charlemagne about him and something of an attorney—all in all , a lofty and original character , a prince who knew how to govern with authority in spite of france ’ s anxiety and how to hold on to power in spite of europe ’ s jealousy
1	with his crimped and pomaded hair , his pinched waist , his womanly hips , and the bust of a prussian officer , surrounded by the murmur of admiration of the girls on the boulevard , his tie suavely knotted , a club in his pocket and a flower in his buttonhole ; such was this fop of the house of death
1	i think i ’ m not mistaken and that those are the names my brother mentioned
1	in this deathly valley , at the foot of the slope the cuirassiers had scaled , now flooded by the masses of the english , under the converging fire of the artillery of the victorious enemy , under a frightening rain of projectiles , this square fought on
1	i have been to the auvergne , i have been to faverolles , sure !
1	all of it was black
1	my friends , every new bridegroom should be a prince aldobrandininumber take advantage of this one minute of your life to soar off into the empyrean with the swans and the eagles , even if it means dropping back down into the bourgeois world of frogs the next day
1	two days of pine cones !
1	he was like the village idiot in the presence of all these fine minds ranged in battle around him—or like a foreigner in the midst of this society that had him by the throat
1	if he hadn ’ t found the bundle of letters by accident , it would have looked like a hoax
1	you ’ re not nearly as ugly
1	thénardier had something stiff in his movements , which reminded you of the barracks when he swore or of the seminary when he made the sign of the cross
1	he resumed his dark dialogue with himself
1	i run into you here on the stairs and then i see you visiting a man named father mabeuf who lives over austerlitz way , sometimes , when i ’ m out walking around there
1	a grate slid open
1	she did everything around the place , the beds , the rooms , the washing , the cooking , whatever , she ruled the roost and called all the shots
1	when he had just got out of that ugly , dark , deforming place we call jail , the bishop had wounded his soul the way a sudden flash of blinding light would have hurt his eyes coming out of the dark
1	while he was carrying marius in this fashion , jean valjean slipped a hand under his clothes , which were pretty much torn to shreds , and felt his chest to reassure himself that his heart was still beating
1	and now , monsieur , picture this : i said nothing , i remained monsieur fauchelevent , i took my place among you , i am part of the family , i ’ m in my room , i come down and have breakfast in the morning in my slippers , in the evening we go off to a show together , the three of us , i accompany madame pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale , we are together , you think of me as the same as you ; one fine day , i ’ m here , you ’ re here , we ’ re chatting away , we ’ re laughing , suddenly you hear a voice shout : jean valjean !
1	you have all kinds of pet names for it : bottom of the soup , crankypants , the mother in the blue yonder ( in the sky ) , the last mouthful , etc , etc
1	otherwise he did not come up with a sou more than the thirty francs
1	those of yesterday are ghosts ; those of tomorrow are spectral larvae
1	since number , there had been small halfhearted riots here and there , swiftly put down but breaking out again , a sign of a vast underlying conflagration
1	how can we fail to see that the mask of modernism has been concealing the most classic academicism : that of an endlessl ) ' reproduced standardization of opinion , the duplication of 'bad feelings ' identically reproducing the duplication of the 'good feelings ' of the official art of yore ?
1	nothing could be more touching than to see him handing the patient a cup of herbal tea with his slight senile tremor
1	i am , with the distinguished consideration that we owe the benefactors of humanity ,
1	they had the effect on him of an apparition seen in a flash of lightning
1	from that moment , he became more gentle and fraternal than ever toward the little children and the suffering
1	suddenly the crowd gave a great cry
1	there in the gloaming , it seemed to be a sort of apparition
1	utopia today , flesh and blood tomorrow
1	when he had run into jean valjean so unexpectedly on the bank of the seine , he had felt something like a wolf catching its prey again—but also like a dog that once more finds his master
1	the opéra danseuses are rose-pink cannibalsnumber they don ’ t eat men , they bleed them dry
1	hello , my good man , said jean valjean resolutely , handing him a sou
1	they conferred on the necessity of seizing the person of monsieur le maire of montreuil-sur-mer
1	king louis xviii , considering as null and void anything that had been done in the hundred days , recognized neither his standing as officer of the légion d ’ honneur , nor his rank as colonel , nor his title as baronnumber he , for his part , never missed an opportunity to sign himself colonel baron pontmercy
1	they were dignified , but they were not august
1	it ’ s the end of the world
1	this red flag kicked up a storm and disappeared into it
1	after about three hundred feet , he reached a point where the street forked
1	they say it ’ s quite a grotto
1	if she does not see monsieur le maire before then , she went on timidly , she won ’ t know monsieur le maire is back ; it will be easy to make her be patient and when the child arrives she will naturally think monsieur le maire has arrived with the child
1	he drags it around with him and he yields to it
1	what was coming to fruition there ?
1	but what does that matter to eternity ?
1	this is one of the ultimate forms of happiness
1	what are you doing here ?
1	it ’ s true , he said , the two of you together , that ’ s all you ’ re good for
1	this bizarre espalier with branches of metal and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean
1	it does indeed feel like a sort of horrible animal of the night that has just been dragged out of its cesspool
1	it was of very fine cambric and they made out at one of the least worn corners a heraldic crown embroidered above these seven letters : lavbesp
1	the army was mined at the same time as the general population , as was later proved by the belfort , lunéville , and épinal movementsnumber they were counting on the numbernd regiment , on the numberth , on the numberth , on the numberth , on the numberth light
1	and i did tell him the last door on the right at the end of the hall
1	he stayed in his backyard , like the dog
1	it ’ s taken care of , i tell you
1	i was once a french soldier , i ’ m a blasted veteran , i ought to be decorated !
1	and i , monsieur le maire , don ’ t know what i am seeing
1	it was cordoned off from the rue du parc-royal on
1	this school , whose pseudoprofundity is all on the surface , dissects effects without going back as far as causes , and rails against the tumult of the marketplace from the height of its pseudoscience
1	when playtime was over and cosette had gone back in , jean valjean would watch the windows of her classroom and at night he would get out of bed to watch the windows of the dormitory where she slept
1	you don ’ t go in too hard ; you don ’ t go asking for trouble ; no talk of a wedding and monsieur le maire and his sash
1	even though no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy , no more in circumscribing the cause than in limiting the effect , the contemplator falls into endless raptures at all these breakdowns of forces that end in unity
1	rain had swollen the river
1	in the rue boucherat , rue de normandie , and rue de saintonge , there are still a few old residents around who remember a gentleman called monsieur gillenormand and who speak of him favourably
1	no , it ’ s not good
1	he didn ’ t have any kind of bag , but obviously had big pockets under his greatcoat
1	he ’ s wearing black for the bishop of digne , said the drawing rooms ; it elevated monsieur madeleine enormously and gave him , suddenly and immediately , a certain standing in the noble world of montreuil-sur-mer
1	then she continued , raking her bitter flaming ghost ’ s eyes over the rest of the crooks : what ’ s it to me if they scrape me off the pavement in the rue plumet tomorrow , hacked to death by my own father—or if they find me in a year ’ s time in a ditch in saint-cloud or on the île des cygnesnumber in among all the rotten old cork floats and drowned dogs !
1	a separate path ran around the outer edge of the garden and along the white wall that enclosed it
1	bullets ricocheted off the cornices of the houses , bored into the barricade , and wounded several men
1	we chip away as best we can at the mysterious block of marble our lives are made of—in vain ; the black vein of destiny always reappears
1	how gloomy my life has become !
1	why didn ’ t the man reappear ?
1	at that instant , he seemed to hear a voice crying out inside him : jean valjean !
1	there is not a hint of respect for any of this in the contemporary trials : 'when will the nuremburg code be applied to medically assisted procreation
1	his daughter appeared , then the servants
1	but what i do know is that there has never been anything but miserable bastards among all those sorts of scum !
1	get out of there , he ’ s dead , dead as a doornail
1	she was also as terrified as a person can be by happiness
1	and where is the public prosecutor to be tried ?
1	on top of that , he had himself revealed his situation of his own accord
1	courfeyrac pulled a mattress off his bed , which had two of them , laid it on the floor , and said : there you go
1	and you know what else ?
1	an enormous battery was hidden by sacks of dirt at the spot that is today known as the waterloo museum
1	the latter spelling would put paid to the pretensions entertained , last century , by the vicomte de gestasnumber of being a descendant of the unrepentant robber
1	cosette and jean valjean fell to their knees
1	nothing of such a fantasy could have any bearing on cosette , who was as pure as a lily
1	she lifted a bare arm and clung to the damper handle of the stove as though feeling not too steady on her feet
1	i have a choice
1	the rule comes first ; as for the civil code , we ’ ll see
1	this explains war , made by humanity against humanity in spite of humanity
1	i didn ’ t say anything
1	this was a separate building with a garden where all kinds of old nuns of different orders lived together , remnants of cloisters destroyed by the revolution ; a gathering of every shade of black , grey , and white , of every possible community and every possible stripe and that we might call , if such a coupling of words is permissible , a sort of harlequin convent
1	he tried again to disengage the chain from the well and could not do it
1	the grandfather stuck to his infallible diagnosis : in love !
1	but , well , enjolras doesn ’ t have a woman
1	there was something unknowable about thénardier the man , whence his absolute hold over the woman
1	the man plunged into the woods with the child , leaving the innkeeper motionless and speechless
1	the emperor had joked with ney , who said : wellington would not be so silly as to wait for your majesty
1	he stepped into the mire
1	at a quarter past four , that is , when night had fallen , he went past the porte saint-martin theatre , where the play they were putting on that day was the two convictsnumber the poster , lit up by the lights of the theatre , struck him even though he was walking fast , and he stopped to read it
1	monsieur leblanc took up the pen
1	the preliminary investigation was under way
1	in number , digne , which had sustained sieges in the wars of religion , number was still surrounded by ancient walls flanked by square towers that have since been demolished
1	one fine day , hucheloup decided the time had come to alert the passing trade to his specialty ; he dipped a brush into a pot of black and as his spelling was peculiar to him , just like his cooking , he improvised on a wall outside this remarkable inscription :
1	last flickerings of a lamp with no oil
1	to sum up , that despot , the cannon , can ’ t do all it would like to ; strength is a great weakness
1	thénardier replied coldly : that ’ s what you think !
1	god subordinated to the police commissioner
1	he came and went this way five or six times on his walk and he did the walk five or six times a week without their reaching the point of exchanging greetings
1	sometimes he would stand for half an hour at a stretch without moving in the shadow of some leonidas or spartacus , number holding a book while his eyes , gently raised , sought the beautiful girl over the top of it and she , for her part , would turn her lovely head toward him with a vague smile
1	case of being caught red-handed in the act of murder , if ever there was one
1	people were transformed , almost without suspecting it , by the very movement of time
1	cosette had a small side pocket in her smock ; she took the piece without a word and put it in her pocket
1	when he looked up again , there was no one in sight
1	made trouble for him in a tweak :
1	the band was growing by the second
1	that ’ s enough , said cosette
1	like everyone else , he was an -ist , without which no one in those days could have survived , but he was neither a royalist nor a bonapartist , nor a chartist , nor an orléanist , nor an anarchist ; he was a bouquiniste , devoted to old books
1	that had replaced the long live the emperor !
1	where does he want me to get them from ?
1	fancy sending me packing when i haven ’ t seen you for four months already and i ’ ve hardly had time to give you a kiss
1	i ’ ll go and see
1	when i return you can give me my money back
1	out of hatred for me !
1	and what about him ?
1	let ’ s have a peek at what grantaire is up to and how far he ’ s got
1	and why does god will it ?
1	it is one of those sins that look very much like a duty
1	as he read , father mabeuf was looking over the book in hand at his plants , among others a magnificent rhododendron that was one of his consolations ; four days of dryness , of sun and wind , without a drop of rain , had just passed ; the branches were hanging down , the buds drooping , the leaves dropping , everything needed watering ; the rhododendron especially was sad
1	at the time , the north end of the rue saint-louis was being repaved
1	nasty people enjoy a grim satisfaction
1	take advantage of this opportunity
1	as he reached this phase in the assistance he was offering the dying man , the officer opened his eyes
1	then his eyes returned to himself , falling on his puny arms and his bony hands
1	in the evening after dinner , she quite often worked on a tapestry in the salon , or on some other dainty work she ’ d been taught in the convent , while jean valjean sat reading beside her
1	the moon cast a bright light over this square
1	in that epidemic , mother magnon had lost her two boys the same day , one in the morning , the other in the evening , when they were still mere toddlers
1	every bit of the filth of civilization , once it is of no more use , falls into this pit of truth where the immense social slide ends ; it is swallowed up in it , but on display
1	she regularly went to church services , said her rosary , read her prayer book , which she called a euchologion , whispered avesnumber in one corner of the house while they were whispering i love yous in the other , looked on marius and cosette as two shadows
1	and yourself with it !
1	he jumped down from the chest of drawers and grabbed his hat
1	it almost hurt him physically
1	by virtue of what right ?
1	among the visitandines , the nun entering says ave maria and the nun whose place is being entered says gratia plena
1	my dear montparnasse , éponine replied very sweetly , you must learn to trust people
1	all salt is drying
1	they all rushed inside
1	skepticism , that dry rot of the intellect , had not left one intact idea in his head
1	when the restoration came , she turned herself into a bigotnumber and with such verve that the priests forgave her her monk
1	i have to choose between the pen and the pick
1	that ’ s right , twenty-one years old , no standing , twelve hundred livres a year , madame la baronne pontmercy will go and ask for two sous ’ worth of parsley at the fruit-seller ’ s
1	the thinkers pondered while the grass roots , meaning the people , run through by revolutionary currents , trembled beneath them with who-knows-what epileptic shocks
1	he has no intention of being a saddle horse
1	so this is how you spruce yourself up for the fine eyes of this general lamarque !
1	only the top of the façade of corinthe suffered ; the crossbar on the upper-storey casement and the attics in the roof , riddled with buckshot and biscayens , slowly warped
1	the paris kid isn ’ t knocked up out of damp chaff , added brujon
1	they didn ’ t see that they were in the same hands that had cleared napoléon out
1	jean valjean , in black , followed behind , smiling
1	the same could not be said for dahlia , zéphine , and especially not favourite
1	in any case , you must see that i am well informed
1	he arrived just in time to see an arm shooting through the hole punched into the wire-meshed glass
1	it ’ s a matter of going back over all the seams we have sewn and seeing if they hold
1	if the facts did their duty , they would stick to being evidence in law ; the facts are god-given
1	what is the world coming to ?
1	you could tell by the perpendicular wrinkles
1	there is only one way to reject tomorrow and that is to die
1	the curious laugh and chatter two feet away from these streets full of war ; the theatres open their doors and perform vaudeville
1	the man was lost
1	the cuirassiers had not succeeded in the sense that the centre was not overrun
1	there was a stone nearby
1	everything we have just said has to be set aside when we consider that extraordinary riot in which you felt the sacred anxiety of labour reclaiming its rights
1	in any case , everything had broken down and new things had to be made out of the fragments
1	this occurred in cosette ’ s bedroom
1	the lawyer had accordingly begun by expatiating on the theft of the apples—something difficult enough to do in the grandiloquent manner , but bénigne bossuetnumber himself was once forced to refer to a hen in the middle of a funeral oration and he carried it off with alacrity
1	one of the thénardiers ’ neighbours met the young mother as she was setting out and he came back with the tale : i ’ ve just seen a girl sobbing her heart out in the street
1	and that woman who has suffered so much , who was so noble in her fall from grace … i was the cause of her downfall , albeit unwittingly !
1	marius followed the rue saint-honoré
1	this little madam , not even two months ago , was sitting pretty in a garret , fitting the little copper rings in the eyeholes of corsets , what do you call those things ?
1	he seemed glad to take as meditative texts those funereal psalms that are full of visions of another world
1	any talk in the street inevitably gathers a circle of people
1	history has nothing more moving than this death rattle bursting out into acclamation
1	marius shuddered from head to toe
1	the last was guy-étienne-alexandre and he was a colonel and something or other in the light horse of brittany
1	the paper caught fire
1	jean valjean went on : the only thing that worries me is what happens in the cemetery
1	he had not eaten or slept for thirty-six hours
1	elsewhere prisoners lay in the open air in the prison yards , piled on top of each other
1	for him , the idea of life itself could not be separated from the idea of cosette ; he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept one without the other and he was unshakably determined to demand of anyone or anything that wanted to force him to live , whoever and whatever they might be—his grandfather , fate , hell—the restitution of his lost eden
1	he leaped down from the tilbury
1	of this man , who was his saviour , nothing ; not a trace ; not the slightest sign
1	the man continued in a tone of voice he hoped sounded casual , but in which there was an odd tremor he could not hide : what does she do , your madame thénardier ?
1	it has never been interested in what was said inside
1	on the other hand , this long illness and convalescence saved him from prosecution
1	that history , made from the very traces those memorable men chose to leave , was now opposed by a history made from traces no one chose as such , the silent testimonies of ordinary life
1	no one knew what it meant
1	every last branch can turn into a dynasty
1	you could say that amazement has its flashes of insight
1	both of us may benefit
1	who among us is without sin ?
1	but we are not living in normal times
1	he believed himself to have been tracked down and pursued
1	they are as carefree and indolent as cats
1	to start with , that other thing was a fright , this one isn ’ t too bad !
1	he could not make sense of what was happening to him
1	we ’ ve got him , this croesus ! number as good as
1	hey you , where ’ ve you come from ?
1	an apple is a meal in itself ; an apple is life
1	death of a horse
1	but what was june number , when it all comes down to it ?
1	half of the cuirassiers stayed on the plateau
1	oh , the young people of today , they ’ re scoundrels , every one of them !
1	she reckoned that when she was young , the bernardines were right up therenumber with the musketeers
1	it ’ s the thénardiers , they ’ re innkeepers , peasants , you can ’ t reason with them
1	at last , where three paths intersected , he stopped
1	he was sure of success ; all he had to do now was close his hand
1	good or evil are behind the stern question mark
1	parisians today who enter the rue rambuteau coming from les halles and notice , on their right , opposite the rue mondétour , a basket weaver ’ s shop whose sign is a basket in the shape of the emperor , napoléon the great , with this inscription :
1	until that day , javert had only ever adopted , of napoléon ’ s two poses , the one that expresses resolution , arms folded over the chest ; the one that expresses uncertainty , hands behind the back , was unknown to him
1	at bottom , martainvillenumber was a jacobin
1	the voice given by the camera to the peasant women of efremov , at the very moment when it shows their historic dignity , sends them back to their non-being
1	there are two of us here who will have only one thought from now on—your happiness !
1	if he was a murderer , would i save him ?
1	the old woman did the housework and the cooking and the shopping
1	she was some months behind
1	what i ’ m thinking is this : that god can ’ t possibly want to separate us
1	the lovers saw each other every day
1	this had already been done
1	while cosette was still tiny , she was the whipping boy , so to speak , of the other two girls ; as soon as she began to grow , that is , even before she was five , she became the drudge for the entire household
1	we might say , by the way , that success is pretty awful
1	yes , that ’ s the way !
1	the marauders flew off to one corner of the battlefield while they were being shot in another
1	whoever sees it quakes in their boots with the most mysterious of terrors
1	and alongside all this—all such contradictions are the lightning play of love—they liked to laugh and with such delightful abandon and such intimacy that they sometimes seemed almost like two boys
1	the event is always resistance , between what the speech-act seizes and what the earth buries
1	one evening , marius was talking , in front of cosette and jean valjean , about the whole peculiar episode , of the endless information he had gathered , and the pointlessness of his efforts
1	a good hour passed in this way
1	before we go any further , it would be appropriate to recount in some detail a weird incident that happened at montfermeil around the same time and that may not be purely coincidental to certain conjectures of the public prosecutor ’ s department
1	jean valjean cocked an ear and heard something like footsteps receding
1	once this commitment was made , a man seated in a corner of the cabaret put on a ringing voice and boomed , you know what you ’ re saying !
1	wherever it hurts , we probe ; and , once we ’ ve diagnosed the trouble , studying the cause leads to discovery of the remedy
1	sometimes the boarders were allowed , as a major excursion , to go and visit them , which means that those young minds have retained , among other memories , the memory of mother saint basil , mother saint scolastique , and mother jacob
1	yet sundry complications were looming
1	one broken baluster stands on its shaft like a broken leg
1	mademoiselle baptistine also had a huge bergèrenumber in her room made of wood that had once been gilt and covered in a soft floral pekin silk , but this bergère had had to be winched up to her room upstairs through the window , as the stairway was too narrow , and so it could not be counted among the movable furniture
1	the closer he got to that street corner , the brighter his eyes would grow ; a sort of joy would light up his pupils like an inner dawn ; he looked fascinated and overcome with emotion , his lips would move slightly , as though he were talking to someone he could not see , he would smile vaguely and slow his pace to a crawl
1	you are allowed to spy on misfortune as a traitor if you are going to relieve it
1	paris begins with the dawdling onlooker and ends with the gamin , two beings that no other town is capable of ; the passive acceptance that makes a person happy just to look on , and inexhaustible initiative ; prudhomme and fouillounumber paris alone boasts such native fauna
1	besides , let ’ s admit it , this same small world had its grandeur
1	fameuil and dahlia were humming ; tholomyès was drinking ; zéphine was giggling ; fantine smiled
1	one morning the hotelkeeper sailed into marius ’ s room and said : monsieur courfeyrac has vouched for you
1	a few people , though , remained curious , thinking that what might be involved in the whole business was not the fabulous treasure of legend , but a real windfall , a lot more serious and substantial than the devil ’ s banknotes , and whose secret boulatruelle had half-gleaned
1	that ’ s all … so , madame , he added , what do i owe ?
1	it was as though a ray of sunshine had gone astray and , without realizing it , had flashed through the night
1	the rim of the hole in the ceiling was soon surrounded by the heads of the dead from which long lines of blood streamed , red and fuming
1	this painting you see here , which was painted by david at bruqueselles , number do you know who it ’ s a painting of ?
1	it was a blissful summer morning , marius was full of joy as you are on a beautiful day
1	what ’ s going to become of you ?
1	to these points and to this testimony the attorney could only oppose his client ’ s denial , a self-interested denial ; but supposing he were the convict jean valjean—did that prove that he was the stealer of the apples ?
1	this was the terror of that poor creature that the reader has perhaps not forgotten—little cosette
1	there was a mirror above the bar
1	he ’ d stick an old chatterbox like me in his poem and he ’ d call him nestornumber my friends , in the old days , in the good old days , they knew how to marry ; they ’ d have a good solid contractnumber and after that a good solid spread
1	some time around number , in an arrondissement of the pas-de-calais , there was a man who had had some kind of scrape with the law some time before and who , under the name of monsieur madeleine , got back on his feet and rehabilitated himself
1	on the other hand , lit up from the front by the light coming through the gate which shone full in his face , the light of a cellar , it is true , livid but sharp in its lividity , thénardier , as the lively if trite metaphor has it , stood out plain as day to jean valjean
1	napoléon , two miles , wellington , a mile and a half ; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side
1	she had all the fears of a convent girl and all the fears of a nun combined
1	if this bastard doesn ’ t show up !
1	she didn ’ t pose herself any questions about the weirdness of a chimney pot that is afraid of being caught in the act and darts back when you look at its shadow , for the shadow had leaped back when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought she was quite sure of that
1	it was the sparrow pecking at the hunters
1	it ’ s usually daybreak that you die
1	we say to ourselves , we talk to ourselves , we cry out inside ourselves , without the outer silence being broken
1	he had lurched from one suffering to the next and had gradually arrived at the conviction that life was a war ; and that in this war he was the vanquished
1	i think it ’ s wonderful that a young man like you should be in love
1	she picked up a man , the first man who happened along , a man she did not love , out of bravado , with rage in her heart
1	yes , these are ghastly times , ghastly , ghastly , and here is what i think of you , of your ideas , of your systems , of your masters , of your oracles , of your doctors , of your little pipsqueaks of writers , of your weasels of philosophers , and of all the revolutions that have terrified the flocks of crows in the tuileries for the last sixty years !
1	here stands another door before us , on the threshold of which we hesitate
1	the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna ; number clovis ’ s tolbiacnumber and napoléon ’ s austerlitz are as alike as two drops of blood
1	there ’ s only one thing sadder than seeing your children die and that ’ s seeing them go bad
1	jean valjean took a swig of brandy and felt thoroughly restored
1	it was not a dream !
1	only that evening , as cosette was saying good night before going to bed , did he hear her say in a faint little voice as though to herself : i think that if ever i ran into one of those men in a dark alley , my god !
1	cosette and marius were in one of those blessed selfish moments when you can ’ t see anything but happiness
1	they were ultra—that is , ultra-royalists ; this word no longer means anything today , although what it represents has not perhaps entirely disappeared
1	haven ’ t you got a wheel you could sell me ?
1	it was a huge spider , black , hairy , horrible
1	he folded his arms , studied the floor at his feet as though he would have liked to disappear through the floorboards into a hole , and his voice suddenly boomed : as a family !
1	vulgar natures have one thing in common with guileless natures and that is that there is never any transition
1	monsieur , the elder of the brothers asked gavroche , pointing to the mesh , what is that ?
1	a bit before this , he had quizzed one of the workers about the daily rate they earned for the job ; they told him that it was thirty sous
1	he backed off , grumbling between his teeth
1	cosette had never had a mother
1	this worthy priest was the brother of a saint-sulpice churchwarden who had several times noticed the man gazing at the child , and the scar on his cheek , and the fat tears in his eyes
1	that particular day , as soon as she spotted monsieur de rohan , she half-rose and called out loudly in the silence of the chapel : lord !
1	in a few days , marius was friends with courfeyrac
1	he saw cosette every day , he felt a sense of paternity stirring and growing inside him more and more , he protected that child with his soul like a brooding hen , he told himself that she was his , that nothing could take her away from him , that this was how it would be forever ; that she would most certainly become a nun , being gently prodded in that direction every day , that accordingly the convent was now the world for her as for him , that he would grow old there and she would grow up there , that she would grow old there and he would die there , that in the end—ravishing hope ! —no separation was thinkable
1	well , i recognize you !
1	my only chair has the bottom out of it !
1	hoche and marceaunumber had no camp followers ; wellington , we gladly do him this justice , had few
1	and all those fichus that turned to rags !
1	i ’ m bringing the boy back dead
1	the decapitated baby jesus , though , was not as lucky as christ
1	bruneseau had only just got past the first sections of the underground network when eight out of the twenty workers with him refused to go any farther
1	he felt even the roots of his hair stand on end with the rousing of egotism , and his ego howled in the abyss of his soul
1	thénardier , for it was indeed he , was strangely taken aback ; he ’ d have been rocked , if that were possible for him
1	at the mention of waterloo , marius , who was leaning on the table beside a glass of water , took his hand away from under his chin and began to study the room in earnest
1	don ’ t you want any more ?
1	only , he feels somehow as though his feet are getting heavier with each step he takes
1	when they saw the cartridges , there was a shudder among the bravest and a moment of silence
1	monsieur to a convict is a glass of water to a man shipwrecked on the medusanumber ignominy is thirsty for respect
1	the fall of the bourbons was full of greatness—not on their side , but on the side of the nation
1	cardinal fesch refused to step down , so monsieur de pins , archbishop of amasie , took over the administration of the diocese of lyonnumber the fight over the valley of dappesnumber kicked off between france and switzerland with a memo from captain dufour , who was later made a general
1	monsieur leblanc got to his feet , put his back to the wall , and swiftly ran his eye around the room
1	monsieur , he said , i must have fifteen hundred francs
1	monsieur le baron , you have under your roof a thief and a murderer
1	the night of the second day he was nabbed again
1	get on with it !
1	every time our cesspools hiccup , it costs us a thousand francs
1	i was licking your arse this morning !
1	to start with , the people don ’ t want anything to do with your republic , they don ’ t want it , they ’ ve got common sense , they know very well that there have always been kings and there always will be , they know very well that the people , after all , are just the people , they laugh at it , your republic , do you hear , you little dimwit !
1	this point of the seine is dreaded by bargemen
1	he went to hear low mass every sunday
1	enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand , just as he had kissed the man ’ s forehead the night before
1	he finally said it
1	it doesn ’ t have a mother or a father , i brought her up
1	you have been abandoned
1	his name is jean valjean
1	and he laid his head back on the mat
1	the reader was one of the big girls , chosen for the week
1	two fresh children ’ s voices could be heard laughing and babbling in a neighbouring room ; that was éponine and azelma
1	well , then , asked brujon , the rue p ?
1	she pulled her hand away and went on , in a tone that would have broken the heart of any observer but that did not remotely move marius , intoxicated , in raptures as he was : oh , how happy you are !
1	that said , she plonked down on the base of the gate , and began quietly singing :
1	the assault was so frenzied that for a moment the barricade was overrun with assailants ; but it shook off the soldiers the way a lion shakes off dogs and was covered in besiegers the way a cliff gets covered in foam—only to reappear a second later , sheer , black , and forbidding
1	a heart under a stone
1	the swans had not yet reached the brioche
1	between eleven o ’ clock and midnight , you will come with your iron bar
1	she added , as though making an effort : the address—you know very well !
1	the sum , six hundred and thirty thousand francs , all in banknotes , did not take up much space and was contained in only one box
1	her soul was trembling on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower
1	we do what we can for her—we ’ re not rich , after all
1	two hours later , at four o ’ clock , when they came to relieve the conscript , he was found fast asleep , slumped on the ground in a heap next to thénardier ’ s cage
1	have you come a long way ?
1	the windbag who did this was a gorgon known as madame victurnien , guardian and keeper of universal virtue
1	fauchelevent , who had sat down , shot up as though a firecracker had gone off under his chair
1	twenty men at the barricade
1	it was the final degree of hypocritical vileness !
1	this man was composed of two sentiments , very simple and very good in themselves , relatively speaking , but which he made almost bad by exaggeration : respect for authority , and hatred of revolt ; and in his eyes , theft , murder , all crimes , were just different forms of revolt
1	if lavaternumber had been able to study the man ’ s face he would have found in it the vulture mingled with the prosecutor , the bird of prey and the pettifogging shyster bringing the worst out in each and completing each other , the shyster making the bird of prey ignoble , the bird of prey making the shyster appalling
1	cosette had not left the rue plumet without a show of resistance
1	marius and monsieur fauchelevent saw each other but did not speak to each other
1	well , then , we ’ d better drink
1	this was the public entrance to the church
1	i went into the second
1	one morning , when monsieur madeleine was in his office , busy settling some pressing mayoral matters ahead of time in case he did decide to travel to montfermeil himself , someone popped in to tell him that police inspector javert wished to speak to him
1	truths he wanted nothing to do with obsessed him inescapably
1	the flask finished off what the unfettered air had started
1	it didn ’ t take much more to get monsieur gillenormand going
1	any more of that and he ’ ll be calling her your majesty like she was the duchesse de berry ! number he must be off his rocker !
1	jean , if you like
1	yes , he said , here i am tittering and killing myself laughing and overflowing with mirth , but i ’ ve lost time , i ’ m going to have to make a detour
1	is this second infinite also intelligent ?
1	he who felt that he could only crawl , at best walk , watched cosette sprout wings
1	they ’ re little devils , those cherubs
1	i can ’ t quite remember his name
1	mother thénardier swiftly replaced her scowl with an amiable grimace , a change of perspective peculiar to innkeepers , and avidly strained to get a look at the newcomer
1	as though she were looking at him for the first time in her life
1	i ’ ll feel the good lord ’ s blessing when cosette is here
1	she backed against the gate , faced the six bandits , though they were armed to the teeth and looked like demons in the night light , and in a firm low voice she said : sorry , i don ’ t want you to
1	why should it be exaggerated ?
1	there was a moment of silence
1	enjolras , courfeyrac , and combeferre were among those who took to the rue bassompierre shouting : to the barricades !
1	but the night really was becoming too much now , the rain was bucketing down so heavily it cleared the streets , the cold was creeping up on them , their clothes were soaked , their shoes had holes in them and were taking on water , the alarming uproar that had just broken out in the prison meant hope was fading , fear was returning
1	the ultimate smile is god ’ s alone
1	the whole time she was there , he had lived that life of ecstasy that suspends material perceptions and causes the whole soul to rush to one point
1	the doctor , who had been sent for , had come running
1	they really were two pretty little girls , more bourgeois than peasants , incredibly charming , one with very shiny auburn plaits , the other with long black plaits that fell down her back , both so lively , clean , plump , fresh , and healthy that it was a pleasure to lay eyes on them
1	god gives men air , the law sells it to them
1	a man had been condemned to death for murder
1	that a life so created is now genetically programmed to suffer abnormally - this constitutes absolute horror
1	all that was once carefully made up is now smeared and laid on with a trowel
1	and all for this old bastard of an apple thief who , beyond any doubt , deserves the galleys for something else , if not for that !
1	in the midst of this melancholy somnambulism in which she was immersed , she told herself : you really need wooden clogs to be in the garden at this hour
1	the violent struggle unleashed in him since the day before was not yet over , and at every moment it took a new turn
1	two of durutte ’ s regiments come and go , bewildered and as though tossed between the sabres of the uhlansnumber and the fusillade of the brigades of kempt , best , pack , and rylandt
1	he looked at her
1	it was all there , it was the same apparatus , the same time of night , almost the same faces on the judges , soldiers , and members of the audience
1	jean valjean was the unhappier of the two
1	as he said no more , she burst out : so , why— ?
1	though we have to say that no one ever took the key out of the door
1	black coats and round hats had virtually disappeared
1	they have such a good little argenteuil wine , mumured fauchelevent
1	the little one repeated in a small voice from time to time : i ’ m hungry
1	they butter their dry bread with it
1	he was one of those who think that science will wind up turning the tables
1	no one could say ; all that was known was that , when he came back from italy , he was a priest
1	but i don ’ t have many toys
1	there were now only five thugs left in the rathole besides thénardier and the prisoner
1	gavroche was a human whirlwind
1	strolling together in lonely expanses !
1	resisting the camp 's fate to erase and silence means not only inscribing the traces of the horror as a faithful witness
1	having nothing to seal this letter with , he merely folded the page in four and wrote this address out : to mademoiselle cosette fauchelevent , care of monsieur fauchelevent , rue de l ’ homme-armé , no
1	after a quarter of an hour , he got up , as though he were about to begin walking toward the bench again , surrounded as it was in glory
1	she did not look at a single merchant ’ s display on the way
1	you saved the life of a colonel—
1	obviously an enormous event
1	he carted off his flora , his copperplates , his herbariums , his portfolios , and his books and set up near la salpêtrière in a kind of cottage in the village of austerlitz , number where he had three rooms and a hedged-in garden with a well for fifty écus a year
1	in the antechamber , three violins and a flute softly played haydn ’ s quartets
1	me , i fancied … in a word , that ’ s what i did !
1	so that ’ s that , he ’ s dead
1	but don ’ t rely on it too much
1	if you ’ d done that , we wouldn ’ t have touched you
1	father gillenormand did not do it deliberately , but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic way of hisnumber
1	calvin grabs socin by the hairnumber but nothing stops or interrupts the straining of all these energies toward their goal , and this vast simultaneous activity comes and goes , goes up and down and up again in the darkness , slowly transforming what lies above from below and the outside from the inside , in an immense teeming infestation
1	he went and sat in the corner of the fireplace meditating , his feet on the hot ashes
1	you ’ re the right age for it
1	they were shoved under this beam where each one of them had his iron brace swinging in the darkness , waiting for him
1	you don ’ t shoot outside the ranks any more with your soul than you do with your gun
1	he would vanish like an apparition and then reappear as though popping up out of the ground
1	this punic labour , incontestably authorized by war , which allows for traps , was so well performed that haxo , sent by the emperor at nine o ’ clock in the morning to reconnoiter the enemy batteries , did not notice a thing and returned to tell napoléon that there was no obstacle apart from the two barricades barring the roads from nivelles and genappe
1	he was very soon down to his last sou , never to his last laugh
1	the whole episode greatly enhanced fauchelevent ’ s standing
1	before , her soul had been cold , now it was warm
1	it is both nation and idiom at the same time ; it is theft in its two different species , people and language
1	the suffocation of the soul !
1	she whiled away her time on sundays after mass counting the linen in her trunk and spreading out on her bed all the dress material she bought piecemeal and had never run up
1	to the casual observer who lets his imagination run , all these men in groups huddled together look like so many sinister beehives where certain kinds of mind buzz away , building all kinds of bleak constructions together
1	it goes without saying that he will be worthy of it
1	the gamin embodies paris and paris embodies the world
1	take your foot away , right now !
1	you hear it and you recognize in cambronne the old soul of the giants
1	that done , cosette had pleaded a persistent migraine , said good night to jean valjean and shut herself up in her room
1	he did battle as though he were in a dream
1	it ’ s the denoument of the elegy in andré chénier ’ s le jeune malade—the andré chéniernumber who had his throat cut by the bast—by the giants of ’ number
1	what the chief tenant noted
1	but was this g—— really a vulture ?
1	at the time of the emperor ’ s landing , the trois dauphins had been the talk of the region
1	with that , he started pacing again , erupting like a volcano as he did so : ah !
1	he went to the mantelpiece , swept up the two silver candlesticks , and handed them over to jean valjean
1	the amazement of marius
1	it was only the second or third she had ever seen in her life
1	she plopped on the grass and stayed there , squatting
1	a pretty good fire had been lit
1	it is there , with its sublime and brutal end ; and no matter how innocent souls may be , you can feel , in the most decorous tête-à-tête , the wonderful and mysterious difference that distinguishes a couple of lovers from a pair of friends
1	monsieur javert , my good monsieur l ’ inspecteur !
1	while he was thinking along these lines , devastated but resolute , hesitant , though , and , in a word , shuddering in the face of what he was about to do , his gaze wandered about the interior of the barricade
1	when it was pitch black , he would speak , though only to his accomplices and only with his back turned
1	equality , citizens , is not the levelling of all the vegetation , a society of tall blades of grass and short oak trees , a community of envies leaping at each other ’ s throats ; it is , in civic terms , all aptitudes having the same opportunity ; in political terms , all votes having the same weight ; in religious terms , all consciences having the same right
1	less than a mile away , at the corner of the rue du temple that debouches onto the boulevard near the château-d ’ eau , if you were game enough to poke your head out beyond the tip formed by dallemagne ’ s shop front , you saw way in the distance , beyond the canal , in the street that goes up the slopes of belleville , at the highest point of the hill , a strange wall reaching the second storey of the façades , a sort of hyphen linking the houses on the right and the houses on the left , as though the street had decided to fold its highest wall back in on itself to seal itself abruptly off
1	at the time of her birth , the directoirenumber still held sway
1	the sun ’ s going down
1	cosette did not hesitate for a second
1	you can keep your théodule to yourself
1	so , there , she said
1	a legitimist association , the faithful knights , moved among these republican affiliations , but it was denounced and repudiated
1	all that , that ’ s the ceremony of dying
1	the grace of a child was still struggling with the ghastly premature aging brought on by debauchery and poverty
1	inquiries are made in faverolles
1	marius offered the old man his arm and walked him home
1	in the twentieth century , it was art 's turn to feel the impact of industrial repetition - head-on
1	let ’ s hope he doesn ’ t get it wrong !
1	these men patiently follow such bourgeois
1	you could hear the overhead dialogue of birds in their nests bidding each other good evening in the elms of the champs-élysées
1	i ’ ll give you a hand
1	he hugged the elephant ’ s rough foot and in the twinkling of an eye , without deigning to use the ladder , he had shinnied up and reached the crevice
1	i don ’ t like seeing people accused unjustly
1	in less than a minute , two thirds of the cobblestones that enjolras had had piled at the door of corinthe had been taken up to the first floor and the attic , and before another minute had passed , these cobblestones , artistically packed one on top of the other , walled up half the height of the window on the first floor as well as the dormer windows in the roof
1	me , i was fond of the duc de bordeaux
1	he waited for night to fall with feverish impatience , he only had one clear idea left and that was that at nine o ’ clock he would see cosette
1	he liked to go to saint-médard , the nearest church
1	they went through the trapeze formed by the inside of the barricade like this
1	i ’ ve dressed her with my hair
1	they went up to the first floor
1	while jean valjean was busy building a normal place for cosette in society and possession of an unassailable status , monsieur gillenormand saw to the wedding presents
1	as for monsieur gillenormand the elder , he did not barter when it came to giving alms and gave willingly and generously
1	thérèse brought them into the world , jean-jacques booted them out into the world
1	well , yes , but you ’ re right , i ’ m an idiot , why not just stay ?
1	his theories as an innkeeper sometimes shot out of him in flashes
1	you could just see , in the right-hand corner at the back , on padded white satin cushions , a broad face , firm and rosy , a forehead freshly powdered à l ’ oiseau royal , an eye proud , hard , and keen , a scholar ’ s smile , number two great braided epaulets floating on a bourgeois frockcoat , the golden fleece , the cross of saint louis , the cross of the légion d ’ honour , the silver medal of the holy spirit , a fat gut , and a wide blue sash : number this was the king
1	there has been a misunderstanding
1	as an institution and a mode of training for man , monasteries were good in the tenth century , debatable in the fifteenth , and detestable in the nineteenth
1	here , in the square , i was about to lie down on a stone
1	the stranger , without getting up from his chair , turned toward mother thénardier
1	heralding the coming proliferation of live shows in museums , silence has become identified with death
1	he condemned it to his hate
1	not a bad joke !
1	monsieur tranchelevent inclined his head
1	one doesn ’ t rule out the other
1	there ’ s still the empty coffin
1	to shout out at the first guardhouse they came to : here is a fugitive from justice who has returned illegally !
1	he couldn ’ t breathe , he placed his hand on his heart to slow the beating
1	she was more than a match for the other two little girls for the stylishness of her outfit ; she had a fine linen bonnet trimmed with valenciennes lace and a little chemise with ribbons
1	cosette put catherine on a chair , then sat on the floor in front of her and stayed there without moving , without saying a word , in an attitude of contemplation
1	the fifty men in the barricade had quickly exhausted the meagre provisions of the tavern over the sixteen hours they had been there
1	that machine later became quénissetnumber
1	jean valjean flourished and felt his happiness growing from the happiness he gave cosette
1	here again there was a magic word that you had to know
1	the sand is like pitch underfoot ; his soles stick to it ; it ’ s no longer sand , it ’ s glue
1	you ’ ve got to get out of here , though
1	what are you doing , coming here and stopping us from getting on with the job ?
1	the traveller told her tale , a slightly edited version : how she had been a working woman ; how her husband had died ; how she couldn ’ t find work in paris and was now looking elsewhere , in her own part of the country ; how she had left paris , on foot , that very morning ; how , since she was carrying her child , she had got tired and , having come across the villemomble coach , had hopped on ; how from villemomble she had reached montfermeil on foot ; how her little girl had walked a bit , but not far , she was so little , and so she had had to carry her and her treasure had fallen asleep
1	cried cosette on entering
1	jean valjean ’ s calmness was one of those powerful tranquilizers that are contagious
1	i don ’ t know what else you want me to say
1	a phenomenon not altogether foreign to certain well-organized police
1	and out of that particular vacuum , he creates the very place of charles 's love for emma
1	just tell me how she is
1	after the funeral , he went straight back to paris and got stuck into law again , without giving his father another thought , as though his father had never lived
1	all of a sudden , one of the peddlers who lodged in the tavern came in and said in a hard voice : no one ’ s watered my horse
1	marius arranged things so that he was always out when jean valjean called
1	this time it was not a mirage
1	monsieur madeleine promised me one
1	he murmured , looking at cosette and marius
1	once , though , he had a burst of real joy
1	he had thick bushy eyebrows , enormous black side-whiskers , bulging eyes , a muzzle of a chin , and over it all that indefinable air of being right at home
1	he had no weapon and was rushing so as not to be left behind , although he looked lost in thought
1	your grandfather looks so nice !
1	he slipped in the way a grass snake slides into a crack , kept going , and a moment later the two boys vaguely made out his whitish head as it popped out , a pale and wan disk , at the edge of the hole full of darkness
1	a trade , a simple trade !
1	the prisoner is prone to flight the same way a sick person is prone to the crisis that cures or kills him
1	it was only with great difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to bundle up a bit of linen and clothing and a few toiletries
1	that evening , when he got back to his garret , marius ran his eyes over his clothes and realized for the first time that he had the sordidness , the indecency , and the unbelievable stupidity to go walking in the luxembourg in his everyday attire , that is , in a hat that was ripped near the band , great walloping carter ’ s clodhoppers , black trousers that were shiny at the knees , and a black coat threadbare at the elbows
1	but the truth is that this little boarding-school girl , fresh from the convent , chatted with an exquisite perspicacity and at times came out with all sorts of true and subtle things
1	jean valjean answered , and the sound of his voice seemed to wake javert : he is precisely what i wanted to speak to you about
1	you will also understand that the gate that so obligingly opened for jean valjean was a bit of cunning on thénardier ’ s part
1	if i was only good for chastising others and not myself , i ’ d be a miserable swine , indeed !
1	what is this about ?
1	well now , follow me
1	to the pole in the peephole , added brujon , meaning the crosspiece of the window
1	for this , he had pawned the copperplates of his flora
1	the woman , a sad bejewelled spectre in a dress , kept walking backward and forward in the snow and did not answer him , did not even glance at him , but continued pacing in silence and with a dismal regularity that brought her back within range of his sarcasm every five minutes , like the condemned soldier going back for the birch
1	she would have caused a heart of stone to melt ; but there is no melting a heart of wood
1	he was on that ship just a moment ago , he was part of the crew , he came and went on deck with the rest of them , he had his share of air , of sunlight , he was alive
1	mother jondrette was sitting next to him
1	then his forehead diminishes , a bit of hair flutters above the sand ; a hand pops up , pokes a hole in the surface of the beach , flaps and shakes , then disappears
1	the two little boys , who hadn ’ t been listening to anything till then , busy as they were picking their own noses , came closer at the sound of that name and gazed at montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration
1	you mean there ’ s a hole ?
1	but , after all , the talk in which his name cropped up was perhaps nothing more than talk ; hot air , babble , words , less than words , pap , as the colourful language of the midinumber puts it
1	jondrette forged straight ahead without suspecting that he was already being watched
1	the humiliation of having lost the scent somewhat and of having been mistaken momentarily about this champmathieu was wiped out by the pride of having been so right to start with and having so long had the right instinct
1	you will hand cosette over to the bearer
1	sleep off the absinthe
1	as he had the reputation of being extremely dangerous in the charlemagne yard , he was put in the new building
1	you would have said that the icy peace of the tomb had seeped up from the ground and spread out under the sky
1	poets love getting around in the trousers of rabbit-skin peddlers and the overcoats of the peers of france
1	what the bishop had wanted him to become , he became
1	then his right arm , raised ready to release the signal shot , slowly dropped , and the moment jondrette shouted , do you hear me ?
1	i prefer glacesnumber on my plate , said favourite
1	it is incontestable that we talk to ourselves , there is no thinking being who does not do so
1	its use was to save from the cold , the frost , the hail , the rain , to protect from the winter wind , to keep from sleeping in the mud that brings fever and from sleeping in the snow that brings death , a little being with no father or mother , with no bread , with no clothes , with no refuge
1	are you interested in this case ?
1	could he straighten up again and regain a foothold on something solid in his conscience ?
1	if you were to take me back , monsieur pontmercy , would that mean i was not what i am ?
1	the hospital had been poorly endowed ; he had provided ten extra beds
1	she had already valiantly renounced finery , dressing in cotton and putting all her silks , all her glad rags , all her ribbons and lace on her daughter ’ s back—the sole vanity that remained to her , this one sacred
1	this was the roof of the new building
1	meetings were sometimes intermittent
1	an event was in train at the end of the walk
1	then , as the bag on his back was uncomfortable and it would make a good pillow , he started to unbuckle one of the straps
1	there ’ s flatfoots about , there ’ s cops , grab yer gear and beat it , cut through the sewer !
1	you ’ d have to buy it first , because we don ’ t know you from adam
1	many a platoon of national guards set themselves up , on their own private authority , as a court-martial and would then try and execute in five minutes any insurgent taken prisoner
1	to make a barricade , answered courfeyrac
1	but i ’ m his son , marius went on
1	this javert who has been on my tail for so long , with his appalling instinct that seemed to have sniffed me out , that did sniff me out , for christ ’ s sake !
1	this word made gavroche shout out loud
1	there is nothing the games of children do not get caught up in !
1	meanwile , two other masks in the same car , an old-fashioned-looking spaniard with an outsize nose and an enormous black moustache , and a skinny fishwife of a young girl wearing an eye mask , or loup , had also noticed the wedding party , and while their companions and the passersby were busy insulting each other , they carried on a dialogue in a muted tone
1	on top of that , he made up verses and songs , which gave him great authority
1	your cup runs over with serenity , gaiety , ecstasy ; you are a beacon of light in the night
1	she ’ ll arrive any moment , i ’ m expecting her
1	the handles are silver at bombarda ’ s and bone at edon ’ s
1	look closely at life
1	having for various reasons failed in his affairs , he had fallen from being a scrivener to a carter and labourer
1	paris no longer has the same outskirts ; the face of what we might call circum-parisian life has completely changed in half a century
1	whether they were in france or england , what did it matter , as long as he had cosette by his side ?
1	after a while , i turned round and i saw a great crowd coming behind me
1	all the crimes of the man begin in the straying of the child
1	so , you go to enormous trouble , for these particular holes are normally very deep , you sweat , you root around , you toil away all night , for this is done at night , your shirt gets soaked , your candle burns out , you damage your pickaxe , and when at last you get to the bottom of the hole , when you lay your hand on the treasure , what do you find ?
1	they sleep together among the stars
1	they did not get much pleasure from this exciting danger , though
1	at the same time , he squeezed the trigger of his carbine
1	any number of stories made the rounds about madame albertine
1	after that , nothing and no one had wanted her
1	alcippe , it ’ s true , then , in a little you ’ ll be marriednumber
1	here there is a region , a town , factories , a whole industry , workers , men , women , old grandfathers , children , poor people !
1	well , then , they would go
1	but surely i can find a horse for hire in the village ?
1	yes , combeferre went on , and mine , too
1	to bear witness to a confrontation in history , the filmmaker links together moments of rest or dream , as in a juxtaposition of under-motivated images
1	mother magnon sought an expedient
1	history as the sensible fabric of things is doubled by history as fate-dealing power
1	so this is what appears to political philosophers :
1	to come out of it slain or victorious , the only possible way out from that point on
1	father fauchelevent ’ s off with his basket , it ’ s as simple as that
1	oh , but i have to laugh
1	it ’ s nothing to do with us
1	there ’ s a girl there giving you the eye—go on , look !
1	you ’ re not supposed to do that sort of thing
1	truth is , he ’ s just the bloke to get his hands on lucifer ’ s stash
1	there was a real danger he would slip under one or the other of the two
1	these were the sentinel at the end of the street and the scout at de la petite-truanderie ; the scout at the rue des prêcheurs lane had stayed at his post , which indicated that nothing was coming from the direction of the bridges or les halles
1	he had at once both spied on him on his own account , for pleasure and out of instinct , and spied on him as though he were being paid to do so
1	he retraced his steps furiously and threatened them with his stick ; the children scattered like a flock of birds
1	so , what prevents this nondescript subject from getting behind the camera and making history with it ?
1	she was virtually famous in the congregation for this imperturbable truthfulness
1	and so she made it to the spring
1	i did what i could
1	then the nuns split into two lines ; one line files past her , saying in a plaintive tone , our sister is dead !
1	the bourbons took respect with them , but not regret
1	when he was declared to be rich , those who comprised society saluted him and about town he began to be called monsieur madeleine ; his workers and the children continued to call him father madeleine and that was the thing that most made him smile
1	there , he had got down and the fiacre had taken cosette back to the rue de babylone
1	madame , he said , do you do a brisk trade in this montfermeil ?
1	he gave a jerk
1	numbera , rue du faubourg-poissonnière , in the number of five or six thousand , in a courtyard at an armourer ’ s
1	we drew lines we never cross
1	montparnasse again adopted a serious tone and , swallowing every consonant , he said : things
1	the cell next door was occupied by a very poor young man named monsieur marius
1	it was his majesty ’ s animal
1	madame magloire understood and immediately went and fetched the two silver candlesticks from the mantelpiece in monseigneur ’ s bedroom and placed them on the table with the candles lit
1	to paint the portrait of the child is to paint the portrait of the city , and it is for this reason that we have studied the eagle in this candid little sparrow
1	musketry alternated with grapeshot , without actually doing too much damage , if the truth be known
1	at eight o ’ clock in the evening he realized this and , since it was too late to go down to the rue saint-jacques , he said well !
1	but the camera lens is indifferent to all that
1	from each translation a party is born , and from each misreading a faction ; and each party believes it has the only true text , and each faction believes it holds the light
1	well , so be it ; but , sweethearts , remember this : you eat too much sugar
1	on the way there he ran into courfeyrac and pretended not to see him
1	listen , a pretty apple-cheeked baby brimming with health , who babbles , and jabbers away , and laughs , and smells so sweet when you give them a kiss—do you know what happens to that baby when it ’ s abandoned ?
1	i ’ m an old hand , you ’ re new
1	cosette did not bother to try and understand a thing and was happy beyond words , between the doll and the man
1	mother thénardier , as was her wont , had left her husband to it
1	i said to myself : blondeau , my love , you won ’ t have even a hint of an execution today
1	it was toward this corner of the square , so dimly lit by the reflection of a distant streetlamp , that the boy directed the two toddlers
1	nothing was as poignant and terrible as this face in which what we might call all the bad of good was exposed
1	he could not have said
1	an adept of the then very recent discoveries in the psychology of perception , this pioneer of abstraction would seek to clear the field of all the formal references of figurative art
1	france has its relapses into materialism , and , at certain moments , the ideas that clog that sublime brain have nothing left in them that recalls french greatness and are the size , instead , of a missouri or a south carolinanumber what can you do ?
1	he scarcely spoke , gave awkward answers , but from head to toe , his entire person screamed that he was not guilty as charged
1	the work of the engraver ’ s burin on its own would be too pale ; we need to pour concentrated prose that bites into the engraved lines
1	a name is a centre , centre—which is a profound association for you
1	the splendour of all that is immaculate and inaccessible is hurled at them , heaped upon them
1	bonaparte as the victor at waterloo—this was no longer in the law of the nineteenth century
1	marius went and ate even more than the night before
1	let ’ s not go too far , though ; in relation to jean valjean , this disregard and this erasure were only superficial
1	if only he were still young !
1	this is what he wrote :
1	he grabbed the two candlesticks
1	montparnasse had the furious humiliated look of a wolf that has been snatched by a sheep
1	con- fronted by such 'expressionist ' events , surely we can
1	i just mentioned eve , it is you who created her
1	at the convent cosette continued to keep silent
1	true or false , what is said about people often has as much bearing on their lives and especially on their destinies as what they do
1	i don ’ t know , replied the little girl
1	if you want to be happy , monsieur , you must never have a sense of duty ; for the moment you do , it becomes implacable
1	but on that score he intended to be discreet
1	old age goes to the end
1	why didn ’ t he call out for help ?
1	was it for something so petty that he had done all he had done ?
1	for in revolutions , the party in revolt is not the people , it is the king
1	his wife , the second one , had managed his fortune in such a way that all that was left to monsieur gillenormand , when one fine day he found himself a widower , was just enough to live on , and that , only by turning virtually the whole amount into an annuity , number fifteen thousand francs in income , three quarters of which would expire with him
1	he set to work
1	a whole new world appeared to his soul : kindness accepted and returned , devotion , miséricorde , leniency , the havoc wreaked on austerity by pity , acceptance of other people , no more definitive condemnation , no more damnation , the possibility of a tear pearling in the eye of the law , some indefinable sense of justice according to god ’ s rules that was the reverse of justice according to man
1	let ’ s not blindly accept what they tell us
1	it ’ s in that room that the court is sitting
1	i was wrong just now , monsieur
1	two divisions , the fifth and the sixth , were wiped out
1	jean valjean was carrying him in such a way that his chest was not squashed and he could breathe as freely as possible
1	father fauchelevent gasped and screamed :
1	and so , mastering some and mastered by others , crushing those below and suffocating under those above , vainly endeavouring to shake off the blows raining down on him , monsieur leblanc disappeared beneath this horrible pile of thugs like a wild boar under a howling pack of mastiffs and bloodhounds
1	you ’ d have said they were monkeys from the court of a tiger
1	this prognostic declared , the prioress immediately took cosette to her heart and gave her a place in the boarding school as a charity case
1	a chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths
1	the senator mentioned earlier was a smart man who had made his way in life with a single-mindedness oblivious to any of those stumbling blocks known as conscience , sworn oaths , justice , duty ; he had gone straight for his goal without ever deviating from the path of self-interest and his own advancement
1	cosette did not know how to scale a wall
1	no way back up to the quai now ; no more ramp , no stairs ; and they were very close to the bend in the seine near the pont d ’ iéna , where the embankment got narrower and narrower , tapering off in a skinny tongue before vanishing underwater
1	you , cosette , and i , we ’ d have been three heads in the one green lifer ’ s cap !
1	he put the only extant copy under his arm and went out
1	is it condemned to the horror of hearing evil approaching through the denseness of the abyss and of glimpsing , closer and closer to it , beneath the hideous water , that draconian head , that great maw chomping on foam , that serpentine undulation of claws , swellings , and rings ?
1	for , if they had had a different neighbour , a less fanciful and more attentive neighbour , a normal , charitable man , obviously their destitution would not have gone unnoticed , their distress signals would have been seen , and for a long time already , perhaps , they would have been rescued and saved !
1	it continued to yield in silence
1	at the head and rear of the convoy , gendarmes on horseback trotted along gravely , sabres at the ready
1	reckonairs [ i reckon there ’ s ] a shopful of stuff
1	both sides took aim , at point-blank range , so close they were within earshot and could talk without raising their voices
1	what decision did he make ?
1	i grant these times this motto : dirty cleanliness
1	the bouquets of flowers had just had a wash ; all the velvets , all the satins , all the enamels , all the golds that come from out of the ground in the form of flowers were impeccable
1	he didn ’ t have a clue
1	he unfolded it and , as he happened to be near the lamp , he was able to read : the president of the circuit court would like to pay his respects to monsieur madeleine
1	nothing could be more ravishing and noble than all these fresh souls blossoming
1	in those hours of waiting , what did they do ?
1	and diving into the dark confidently like a man who knows his apartment , he took a board and blocked the hole with it
1	and so , given that we are in the nineteenth century , as a general rule , and no matter what people are concerned , in asia as in europe , in india as in turkey , we are against the seclusion of ascetics
1	i ’ d have to see , said mother thénardier
1	if you only knew how much we missed you yesterday !
1	among these men , battre , to beat but also to whip up , means feindre , to feign ; you whip up an illness ; ruse is their strong point
1	that must refer to the post houses
1	he continued to forge ahead , though , regardless , groping in the gloom
1	maybe he was there !
1	the little mouse looks like turning into a money-spinner after all
1	monsieur le duc d ’ orléans gave her good references
1	it ’ s not her fault
1	the gunners get themselves taken seriously
1	when they had put the church behind them , the man , seeing all the shops out in the open under the stars , asked cosette : so the fair has come to town , has it ?
1	you know what you have to do
1	sooner than that , monsieur le maire
1	there are twenty-six of us combatants left standing
1	it was a bizarre assortment
1	pagan mythology was going head-to-head with christian mythology
1	a fresh prairial breezenumber was blowing , stirring the tops of the plane trees
1	here ’ s how it goes : yoo-hoo !
1	as she spoke she reached up to grab the strap hanging from the mantelpiece
1	morality is the blossoming of sundry truths
1	marius could be in no doubt , they were clearly talking about her
1	for them , there is nothing two leagues past its gates
1	i ’ ve done you favours on more than one occasion
1	a driver looking for a tip is capable of anything , even of imagination
1	who ’ d have thought it ?
1	you must have been cold as anything in that coach
1	pardon me , monsieur innkeeper , what ’ s your name ?
1	we pass over the rest , and not the worst
1	the young girl tilted backward slightly and raised her eyebrows as if to say : what ’ s got into you ?
1	marius had reached that point of intoxication where the wall drops and the ice melts , and monsieur fauchelevent was now for him , as for cosette , a father
1	cosette had taken the grandfather ’ s arm and was taking a turn in the garden
1	koch , the blonde romantic who , in , settled in a gloomy valley near weimar where goethe once liked to walk and where , more to the point , he dreamed up his mephistopheles - that spirit that denies all
1	unemployment and poverty were now unknown
1	whatever will your family say , seeing me with a collar all crumpled ?
1	and marius , like the others , had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman monsieur leblanc
1	a bandit has two heads , one reasons out his actions and guides him all his life , the other is what sits on his shoulders the day he dies , when it is on the block ; he calls the head that counsels crime la sorbonne , and the head that expiates it la tronche , noggin
1	you did the right thing
1	monsieur le maire , i don ’ t want you to treat me with goodness , your goodness to others has made my blood boil
1	so you want to blast the apollo belvedere ?
1	the servant lamented in a corner by herself , the curé prayed and could be heard sobbing , the doctor dried his eyes ; the corpse itself wept
1	the relays aren ’ t manned , the horses are in the fields
1	how he protected his house
1	that ’ s more your style
1	he gave a deep sigh
1	what on earth for ?
1	some sucker ’ s fallen for the mother
1	how many times had his conscience , in a frenzy to be good , tackled him and brought him down !
1	we ’ re cutting straight to the romance !
1	dantonnumber has to dare it
1	novices wear the same habit , but all in white
1	what radiance in the anvil !
1	ah , you wicked old pig of a mayor , you came here to frighten me , but i ’ m not frightened of you
1	there is ecstasy in agony
1	not one has escaped
1	that done , he glanced down at his torn chemise with satisfaction
1	once madame magloire had said to him with a kind of gentle malice , monseigneur , you are always so keen to put everything to good use , yet there ’ s a useless garden bed for you !
1	at this point we might note the project of the multinational monsanto designed to genetically programme crop sterilization and designated by the telling name , 'ter
1	aided by science , which derives from man , and events , which derive from someone else , it doesn ’ t worry too much about those contradictions in the framing of problems , which seem to the vulgar to be impossible to solve
1	how did monsieur fauchelevent get there ?
1	the stranger was momentarily spellbound before this sweet and soothing scene
1	that simple question , and cosette ?
1	the day before the date set for the condemned man ’ s execution , the prison chaplain got sick
1	the good lord , having created the mouse , said : oh dear , i ’ ve made a boo-boo
1	the sister felt chilled by something unfamiliar that she detected in all this
1	gibelotte , some light on the subject !
1	he got this initial generous impulse under control and recoiled before such heroics
1	but nothing bearing any resemblance to a blow or an attack , not even some kind of self-defence , came from his hands
1	his imperturbable temerity stuns me
1	he ’ d escape our clutches
1	where are you going , you lout ?
1	he also saw , as if they moved in front of him in perceptible form , the two ideas that , till then , had been the twin rules of his life : to hide his name , to sanctify his soul
1	the quasi-fiction of the student is thereby in turn inscribed within a fiction about the work of memory as it extends across three works
1	a galley slave , sacred !
1	said marius once more
1	oh , thou who art !
1	was he actually the same man ?
1	yes , and a hand that blocked it
1	truth and justice , first and foremost
1	dead eyes—that is the opposite sign
1	not on your life !
1	the result was that her elder daughter was named éponine
1	the beach is perfectly dry , but with every step a person takes , as soon as he lifts his foot , the footprint it leaves fills with water
1	he had gone in because of the carpe horas and had gone back because of the carpes au gras
1	so little ’ uns are good for something , eh ?
1	a twin tubular apparatus , provided with valves and sweeping sluices , sucking in and driving back , an elementary drainage system as simple as a human lung , and which is already fully operational in several counties in england , would suffice to bring into our towns the pure water of our fields and to send back to our fields the rich water of the towns , and this simple two-way movement , the simplest in the world , would let us hold on to the five hundred million we throw away
1	things have reached such a pitch that a pitiful musician par excellence like bob dylan can bemoan the fact that
1	he did not even flinch
1	and what ’ s it to you if you do know him ?
1	finally , he let go of jean valjean , straightened up all in one go , took his club fully in hand , and , as in a dream , murmured more than spoke these questions : what are you doing here ?
1	a man replied : but there ’ s a light on in this room
1	you ’ ve put on a gorgeous cravat this morning , marius
1	lions turned to deer
1	cosette , completely rapt in the ecstasy of possession , saw and heard nothing anymore
1	all the windows were grated
1	bringing up the rue de la chanvrerie in conversation , he turned to monsieur fauchelevent and asked him : you know the street well , don ’ t you ?
1	there , he fell asleep and had a dream
1	if we think of nature as providence , society should think of itself as provident
1	they were bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the distant reflection from the torch
1	henri iv ’ s favourite swearword puts sanctity between a blowout and drunkenness
1	guyot , who led the charge of the emperor ’ s squadrons , falls under the feet of the english dragoons
1	he placed a kiss on that pale forehead beaded with ice-cold sweat
1	and for what motive ?
1	do you hope to feel no sting of desire , to pass up the nuptial bed and thumb your nose at love ?
1	there , i ’ ve singed my coat
1	but the father , the real world , that dump , those thugs , that episode , what was the point ?
1	great things had been done while it sat on the sidelines
1	what moved him was habitual indignation , the bitterness in his soul , a profound sense of the iniquities he had been subject to , a reaction against even the good , the innocent , and the just , if such there be
1	cosette , you ’ re happy ; my time is up
1	these two were there thanks to the gates being shut
1	no , i suppose you ’ re not the one who came to montfermeil , to my inn , eight years ago , the night before christmas , number !
1	what is ice-cold is sincere
1	i won ’ t stay long
1	as for us , we do not think so
1	so i ’ m supposed to fail in my duty of care toward all those poor creatures !
1	she searched in the dark with her left hand for a young oak bent over the spring that normally served her as support , found a branch , hung from it , lunged down and plunged the bucket in the spring
1	he stood stock-still , mouth agape
1	the thing was a cart , the being was a peasant from auvergne sleeping in it
1	to the cadran bleu
1	in the moat of vincennes , a monumental pillar rose out of the ground recalling the fact that the duc d ’ enghiennumber had died in the very same month napoléon had been crowned
1	the mysterious power emerging threatened the established order , which was suspect and sly
1	the gross , the twelve dozen , used to cost ten francs and sell for sixty
1	had he lost his scent for catastrophe ?
1	all the flowers opened around them and sent them incense ; they opened their souls and spread them out among the flowers
1	then i beg to reflect
1	mother thénardier handed him the folded bill without answering
1	a hand supports you , it is hers ; lips brush your forehead , hers ; you hear breathing right next to you , it is her breathing
1	for a condemned man , a mask is not a mask , it is a refuge
1	the driver decided to whistle and to swear at his horses instead
1	he was rich , with four thousand francs annual incomenumber—four thousand francs , annual income—a splendid scandal on the montagne sainte-genevièvenumber tholomyès was a wasted high roller of thirty
1	one of the small front wheels was up a bit on a pile of dirt beyond which an open grave could be seen
1	the bishop of digne had none of that harshness , peculiar though it is to many priests
1	a bed with a mattress and sheets !
1	the eldest of the seven children was eight years old , the youngest , one
1	that was the war waged by ambiorix , by artevelde , by marnix , by pelagiusnumber but ambiorix fought against rome , artevelde against france , marnix against spain , pelagius against the moors ; all of them against the foreigner
1	that would be the crowning glory of your ignorance
1	peace is happiness digesting
1	you ’ ll drink water , you ’ ll eat black bread , you ’ ll sleep on a plank with irons riveted to your limbs and you ’ ll feel how cold they are at night against your skin !
1	monsieur leblanc answered without showing the slightest emotion : i don ’ t know who you mean
1	towns , like forests , have their dens where the nastiest and most terrifying creatures they harbour hide
1	put me to use
1	not one spark of certainty or truth had shot out even from the most horrifying shock
1	between the old sewer and the current sewer , there has been a revolution
1	mass had scarcely begun when an old man appeared and said to marius : monsieur , that is my place
1	basque just happened to be in the courtyard at the appointed time—as though under orders
1	monsieur françois de neufchâteau , the praiseworthy keeper of the flame of parmentier ’ s memory , number did his level best to see that pomme de terre—potato—was pronounced parmentière , but he did not pull it off
1	one of them told us one day : to see the cobblestones on the street made me shiver from head to toe
1	how did this trust come into my hands ?
1	paris is the ceiling over the human race
1	it has had it with those two tenses , which are so good at conjugating their double absence
1	the murderer turned and saw in front of him the cold white face of enjolras
1	what do i care ?
1	gardens and meadows , with water in their roots and sunshine in their flowers , turn into incense burners and smoulder away , releasing all their perfumes at once
1	she rushed to send her daughters to bed , then asked the yellow man for his permission to send cosette to bed , too—she ’ s had such a big day today , she added , on a maternal note
1	what am i going on about ?
1	the words he most often uttered were a sensible fellow and naturenumber he did not use the latter in its general sense according to the meaning our age has assigned to it
1	a vocal mother : why are you crying , my child ?
1	what would be the point ?
1	jean valjean ducked out through the opening , stepped into the street , dashed through the hail of bullets , raced to the mattress , grabbed it , loaded it onto his back , and returned to the barricade
1	what was jean valjean ?
1	a convent is a contradiction
1	not going out anymore , he had reverted to it and preferred it
1	elsewhere , close to the seine , and even some distance from the river , at belleville , grande-rue , and the lunière arcade , for instance , you come across quicksand where a man can drop out of sight in a trice
1	we even called him jean-the-jack , he was so strong
1	he responded to each discharge with a verse
1	marius knew that the moment to intervene would arrive in a matter of seconds and he raised his right hand toward the ceiling , in the direction of the hall , ready to let fly with a pistol shot
1	he didn ’ t hear a word of what madame magloire had let slip
1	next to the old man sitting in the wheelchair stood a young boy , the little shepherd
1	how long were they left like this ?
1	even though it ’ s night , i can hear barbary organs and the machines in the mills spinning , i don ’ t know
1	but those breaths were enough to arouse and excite the whole of the natural world around them
1	he didn ’ t know it , of course , but the first positive result for him of this shift was to stop the cocked pistol from going off and to paralyze marius , for whom the urgency disappeared
1	as though he had a key , everything opened ; he could explain to himself what he had hated , he could fathom what he had abhorred ; from that moment on , he could see clearly the providential , divine , and human meaning of great things he had been taught to detest and of great men he had been trained to curse
1	gusts of hot air rose up from the depths of ’ number and ’ number and floated about
1	basque and the porter had carried marius into the salon and he was still stretched out motionless on the sofa where they had first laid him
1	twenty of them pile in a car built for six
1	at that moment , while he loaded his shovel , the gravedigger bent down and the pocket of his jacket gaped wide open
1	besides , he had seen for himself that personal assets had their ups and downs , turning , for example , into national propertynumber and being confiscated ; he had witnessed the vicissitudes of the tiers consolidé , number the consolidated third policy of number , and he did not have much faith in the ledger
1	he had noticed the streetlamp
1	ah , the strange contradictions of the human heart in its most sublime moments !
1	what happened next in the destiny of monsieur myriel ?
1	you ’ ll need a stone , too , but you ’ ll find plenty outside
1	the four frolicking couples , at one with the sun , the fields , the flowers , the trees , were radiant with happiness , too
1	an old man known as father fauchelevent had just fallen under his cart when his horse fell
1	inflamed convictions , embittered enthusiasms , agitated indignations , warlike instincts held back , exalted young spirits , blindly generous impulses , curiosity , the taste for change , the thirst for the unexpected , the feeling that gives us pleasure reading the bill for a new show and makes us thrill to the whistle of the stagehand at the theatre ; vague hatreds , resentments , disappointments , any vanity that feels that fate has failed them ; discontentments , hollow dreams , ambitions hedged in by high walls ; whoever hopes that collapse will provide a way out ; finally , at the very bottom , the peat bog , that mud that catches fire—these are the elements that make up a riot
1	he saw jean valjean perfectly well , but he took no notice of him
1	we have already sketched that sad little figure
1	this is the dead room , said enjolras
1	i don ’ t understand how he got out of there alive
1	never did marius set foot in the house
1	marius ended up knowing very well this rare , sublime , and gentle man , this rather lamblike lion who had been his father
1	it was a rather vast dimly lit enclosure , now full of din , now full of silence , where the whole apparatus of a criminal trial unfolded in all its mean and mournful gravity before the multitude
1	while we were chatting we got cold because of the open window
1	slang lives off the language
1	what a sorry man i am !
1	a few yellow leaves , left over from the previous autumn , merrily chased each other , like gamins playing
1	oh , i am playing , replied the little girl
1	people are crushed to death , trampled , others walk over the dead and over the living
1	we who believe in death are not among those who would reject this mysterious explanation
1	as for you , i poke my tongue at you
1	a fact to note is that before reaching the exit gate , the convict , who came from way down the sewer , had to have encountered a dreadful bog where it would seem he could well have left the corpse , but the very next day , the sewer workers working on the quagmire would have found the murdered man and that was not how the murderer wanted it
1	the driver , a black silhouette on his box , whipped his bony horses
1	there was something painted on the board that looked like a man piggybacking another man wearing a general ’ s big gold epaulets with big silver stars ; red splotches represented blood ; the rest of the tableau was of smoke and probably represented a battle
1	we could almost leave it there as far as courfeyrac goes and just say , as for the rest : for courfeyrac , see tholomyès
1	you could feel the truth in this coldness of the grave
1	surprised but not frightened , the insurgents had rallied
1	he had to do it !
1	one of these monsters was going to cart her off into the darkness ?
1	this is about the conflict between the poet and those bores , the railway workers who , laid out by heavy sunday drinking sessions , close off , by their abandon , the vespertine distance ’
1	even in the political stance we have just chided him for and that we are inclined to judge almost severely , we have to say he was tolerant and even-keeled , which is , perhaps , more than can be said for the man addressing you now
1	other than this , nothing much ever happened to him
1	even when young she had not been pretty
1	the wrapping paper was greenish and looked mouldy
1	to think—that ’ s the real triumph of the soul
1	at each shot you could see the slats of the blind quivering
1	a laughter too cynical to be frank
1	nothing could be more mournful than to see her frolicking and flitting , so to speak , about the room , like a bird with a broken wing , frightened by daylight
1	this guffaw was wanting in respect for the group
1	the sludge was dense enough to hold one man ’ s weight but evidently could not bear two
1	javert went on : you said fauchelevent , rue de l ’ homme-armé ?
1	he was always looking for any opportunity to educate himself and this ripper-upper of posters had gained his esteem
1	after a silence , he added : go tomorrrow morning
1	put the city to work manuring the plain and you just can ’ t fail
1	it was éponine who , at the champ de mars , had given jean valjean that evocative warning : clear out !
1	and that very evening , marius was installed at the hôtel de la porte saint-jacques in a room right alongside courfeyrac
1	at this point in civilization , the exact is an essential element of the marvellous , and artistic emotion is not merely served but completed by the organ of science ; dream must be able to add up
1	separately , marius and jean valjean would have had a chance to get out
1	in pulling in their rope , they had broken it and a bit had remained tied to the chimney on the roof
1	she had barely finished this verse when she cried :
1	they were right , these were jean valjean ’ s footsteps
1	he did not reply
1	the tender and savage tone in which combeferre was singing gave this verse a sort of strange grandeur
1	napoléon built—the figures are curious—number , number metres ; louis xviii , number , number ; charles x , number , number ; louis-philippe , number , number ; the republic of number , number , number ; the current regime , number , number ; in all , at the present time , number , number metres , or sixty leagues of sewers , form paris ’ s enormous entrails
1	he remained pensive for a moment
1	madame magloire shrugged her shoulders
1	and also as a result of that pact , charles and emma 's unhappiness is the exact flipside of the capacity of any life to be memorable
1	the age of history , then , is not the age of a kind of painting that is driven by world catastrophe , and by its own movement , towards rarefaction and aphasia
1	it could be said that death meanders in its throes
1	for her , getting out of here will be easy
1	ministerial councils fretted over the issue of whether the vignettes of acrobatics that spiced up franconi ’ s postersnumber and lured the street rabble should be tolerated
1	they peered into the dark barricade as you would peer into a lion ’ s den
1	he would toss off mediocre verses whenever he had the urge
1	this old geezer ’ s put one over on you !
1	long ago , in the days of history painting , people painted images of the great and their deeds
1	after all the great periods of art , after the great schools such as the classical and the baroque , after contemporary expressionism , are we not now head- ing for that great transgenic art in which every pharmacy , every laboratory will launch its own 'lifestyles ' , its own transhuman fashions ?
1	solus cum solo , in loco remoto , non cogitabantur orare pater nosternumber
1	a moment later , jean valjean approached her and begged her to go and change the thousand-franc note , adding that it was his half-yearly annuity that he had withdrawn the day before
1	yet you could dimly make out walls that intersected as though other things were growing over there , as well as the low roofs of the rue polonceau
1	amen , said fauchelevent , who stuck imperturbably to this way of extricating himself whenever he heard latin
1	when you learn finally to know and when you learn finally to love , you will suffer still
1	marius paid close attention to the man ’ s speech
1	but , as we said , nothing of this was betrayed outwardly
1	at the time when the action of this book occurred , which is , after all , virtually contemporary , there was not , as there is today , a police officer on every street corner ( an advantage there is no time to discuss here ) ; paris was crawling with stray children
1	one day he had done an errand for monsieur baour-lormian , number one of the forty
1	the little boy pressed his hand against him , and felt reassured
1	jean prouvaire was a tad more mellow than combeferre
1	the light of day seems to go out without , the moral light goes out within ; in the these dark shadows , men come up against the weakness of women and children , and bend them brutally to ignominious ends
1	then and there , alone in the darkness , standing trembling with cold and perhaps something else , he thought long and hard
1	marius had told cosette he was an orphan , that his name was marius pontmercy , that he was a lawyer , that he made a living writing things for booksellers , that his father had been a colonel , that he was a hero , and that marius had fallen out with his grandfather , who was rich
1	it is to this feeling that i appeal at such a decisive moment
1	you ’ ll find it cut off a quarter of an hour from here
1	marius had not stopped living at the gorbeau slum
1	succeed : that ’ s the whole idea
1	he doesn ’ t look like he has a sou to his name , yet money means nothing to him ; he pays for lagny and he only goes as far as chelles
1	a priest was needed to attend the prisoner in his last moments , so they went for the local curé
1	the man you are looking for is not this man , it is me
1	nothing is weirder than a barricade gearing up for an assault
1	they make bread to last six months , they bake it with dried cow dung
1	and he turned his head away so that she could not see him drying his eyes
1	come in , he said
1	how to be silent together , a sweetness even greater than talking ;
1	the little girl sighed as though a heavy weight had been lifted from her chest
1	there was no one there , which was hardly surprising , given how late it was ; but it did not look as though the place had been made for anyone to walk in , not even in the middle of the day
1	and he remembered that he had dared to feel sorry for himself !
1	i say every one of them !
1	the loopholes are only in the south wall ; the main attack came from there
1	i ’ ll pay , said the mother
1	less fourteen or fifteen thousand francs perhaps , said jean valjean
1	as they were leaving , thénardier stuck his head out the half-open door and shouted into the hall : whatever you do , don ’ t lose that letter !
1	while he was speaking , he had put his sack and his stick down in a corner , put his passport back in his pocket , and sat down
1	it simply makes those ranks liable to share the same image , an image of the same ontological tenor
1	pale and wan , with his neck bare , his hair wild , his perfectly womanly face , enjolras looked amazingly like the themis of antiquitynumber his flaring nostrils and downcast eyes gave his implacable greek profile that expression of fury and of chastity combined that , in the ancient world ’ s view , belonged to justice
1	to resemble the man in the street who pays his taxes , that was the sum total of his ambition
1	not one cobblestone out of line
1	a growl was heard , the growl of a big dog baring its teeth , standing in for the english
1	monsieur madeleine , who laughed scarcely more often than javert did , began to let loose
1	he escaped impulsively , like a wolf that finds its cage open
1	that can ’ t do any harm
1	which way should he go ?
1	he turned to his wife
1	the change was a set change in full view of the audience , for a day or two , at the rate of thirty sous a day , by means of a costume as closely as possible resembling ordinary average respectability
1	the prioress gave another little interior murmur , probably holy , then spoke up
1	she looked at marius with indifference , as she would have looked at a toddler running around under the sycamores or at the marble vase that was casting a shadow over the bench ; and marius for his part continued his promenade thinking of something else
1	he made gestures and signs that meant no !
1	we will limit ourselves to pointing those questions out
